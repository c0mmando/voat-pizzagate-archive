            And it's a cracker. Also, the symbolism is taking on the body of Christ, not literally, but a symbolic gesture of faith to take on his mission and sacrifice. You're not eating human flesh(it's ridiculous that I have to point this out) and nowhere does the scripture or anywhere else say to eat human flesh, in fact anywhere cannibalism is referred to, it's in a negative light. The Bible also calls "God's word" bread, I don't think people think they're literally eating bread when reading the Bible.

            Lest I remind everyone that we were well on our way to another Holocaust.  The Holocaust started with a Satan worshipping, occult practicing, pedophilic cult,, aka The Third Reich.
           </p>
           <p>
            Clinton and her cronies had the same level of ire and pure vitriol towards the Deplorables.  Their goal was to turn the rest of the left into rabid Deplorable-haters as well.  As evidenced by recent events.  I would not have put it past her evil master plan, and that of the left/Soros, etc, to start "interning" citizens of the US.  Maybe separate some kids out for a steady supply of white children.  I'm sure it happened in the Holocaust as well.
           </p>
           <p>
            Keep this in mind though.  They aren't going without a fight.  Expect more to come.  False flags.  Legal actions.  Who knows.  We won a decisive battle that has all the appearance of changing the tide of the war. But the war isn't over yet.  The enemy needs to be destroyed for good.

            you're right, but using the Italian mafia vs. the Jewish mafia analogy, it is one thing to be openly critical of the former verses the latter, which will result in a lot more blow-back, personal attacks and discrediting an important investigation
           </p>
           <p>
            as the OP, let me be very clear on this; i am absolutely not suggesting that anyone curb or compromise their investigation or hold back from publishing names and facts - all i am suggesting is to be careful of what language is used - in other words, don't start posts with 'Jews did it' in the damned headline because we all know that such content will most certainly be used to discredit the ENTIRE investigation and everyone involved, not to mention the infighting that will result right here
           </p>
           <p>
            you are right, and i agree with you, but i am also sure that many are not ready to see or accept what's behind door #3 without exposing 1 and 2 first

            At the end of the day it's a cracker and some grape juice used for representation &amp; remembrance, and it would take a pretty weird person to actually think it's cannibalism or promoting cannibalism. Anytime actual cannibalism was ever referred to in the scriptures it was in a negative light.

            NOT ALL JEWS ARE BAD, HOWEVER!!!!!!!!!!!!!
I find it pretty shitty that the world banks are ran by Jews and most likely finance a lot of the problems in the world.(to include a global human trafficking syndicate)  The Christian Bible (in Revelation) warns us about Jews who say they are Jews but are of the synagogue of Satan. With the Israel flag being the star of Remphan and only exists because of the same world banker Jews, it TOTALLY makes sense.

            Exactly, but I think there are more than 30, and most of them are Knights of Malta and/or members of other papal secret societies. All you have to do is take a look at the Jesuit Oath to know their M.O. In their secret oath, they pledge to pretend to be a part of whichever opposing group they wish to infiltrate in order to bring it down from the inside, and to kill it's members by any means. The CIA isn't often referred to as the Catholics In Action jokingly for no reason.

            Agree. Stay focused on the crimes being committed. You can make it about the Jews, the wealthy, the politicians, or anything group, but none of those things are inherently evil. Any ideology or tool, such as money can be used for good and bad.

            The 'blame the Jews' crowd are, for the most part, covering for the Roman Catholic Church, and their
            <em>
             known
            </em>
            ties to pedophilia. Further, historically, many of the terrible things that have been blamed on the Jews have in reality their roots in the Jesuit Order.
           </p>
           <p>
            All to many times people point fingers at Jewish control, but fail to make the connections to the Vatican, who are the real power brokers in world power. Are there compromised Jewish figures, yes of course, but when researching global power and control, one would be amiss not to look into the Roman Catholic Church, the Jesuits, and the Papacy.
           </p>
           <p>
            Heck, our own pedo US Vice President is a Knight of Malta (a well known and infamous Roman Catholic knighthood). Frankly, you'd be amazed to find out who all in our halls of government are members of this knighthood.
           </p>
           <p>
            Check out Eric Jon Phelp's work on all of this if interested. He's written a book, which is the authority imo, on the Jesuit Order aka Society of Jesus.

             what we can agree on is that Jewry certainly doesn't have a patent on organized crime, however to underplay the role of Jewry's influence upon the major institutions in the U.S., and probably the west in general, is a megalithic mistake IMO, but this is neither the place nor time

            I've been working on the Hampstead case for two years, at one time we (the researchers) went through this too, blame the Jews...but what we found to be the case was there is a "Triality" as opposed to a "duality" or "singularity".  Between the light and the dark, irregardless of religion there is also a void, not a left or right...but "the way".  I have read in Kerth Barker's work, there is and has been a spiritual war between the Luciferians and Satanists for control of the NWO.  Luciferinism is not Satanism and vice versa.  This Awareness indicates that there will indeed, eventually lead to a new type of Armageddon between these forces of misguided beings who seek power and who enjoy the action of cruelty and sadism. This Awareness indicates essentially there are three types of entities on the Earth plane:
           </p>
           <p>
            those who are associated with the attitude exemplified by the Christ, of loving one another, and of clarity in relationship
those who are exemplified by the attitude as Luciferian, who will deceive and who will manipulate and misrepresent information in order to gain power and advantage over to others and who basically see themselves as separate and important, more important than others and
those who are represented and symbolized by that which has been termed Satanic; whose interest and joy lies in watching the suffering of others. They seek power not simply to be in control, but to be able to harm others. These are the Sadists of society. They enjoy inflicting pain in whatever way they can. 
We found it was best to work from a place of love when exposing the crimes committed against children, not to blame a particular religion, race or "type".  Pedo-sadism and it's many facets spreads across the globe, not just DC, London and Hollywood, but every dark corner of the world.  Be brave and shine your light to expose, expose expose...don't get caught up in the blame game.  Peace!

            There's been a lot of talk about the Jews being behind all this, but the original source actually misheard this information. It's not the JEWS, but the JUICE! O.J. Simpson's glove prints are all over this.

            Why? Jesus told us to. That's the simple answer.  As far as the "pretending", I won't get into the whole transubstantiation thing other than the fact that Catholics (I'm a Catholic) don't believe they are eating symbolic representations of Christ but the sacrament of the Eucharist through consecration transforms those representations into the ACTUAL body and blood of Christ.

            All that being said, yah. It seems like pretty fucked up cannibalism.

             No, the point is if you want go running round screaming 'its the jews!' you are helping to completely blow the credibility of this thing. It is already far too much for the average person to comprehend. Global Jewish Conspiracy is a term which when used causes [peoples eyes to glaze over and quickly label you a nut. If you are trying to convince people to investigate this, the best thing to do is ask concrete questions. 1. Explain the pedophilic art and references at Comet Ping Pong. 2.Explain Heavy Breathing 'I no luv' with its overt pedophilia references and why they were invited to a childrens restauraunt to perform 3. The Podesta's were close friends with many child abusers, including Clement Freud, the prime suspect in Madeline McCann's disappearance. Freud met with the McCanns, had them over for dinner. It is thought the Podesta's were in Portugal for her disappearance and are a perfect match of 2 e-fits of suspects seen nearby. 3. The code talk in Podesta's emails, combined with pedo symbology at these restauraunts.     Those points make it undeniably clear there MUST be an investigation. Throwing Jewish Conspiracy into the mix completely brings down the hard, concrete questions, because it is so vague. Now I'm certain Epstein was a Mossad tool, but for the moment is doesn't help to bring that into it, people are too thick and react emotionally.

             He's saying that there are people in power who are Jewish that use that label to further their personal goals and that they should be considered as individuals. The Goldberg family down the street from you doesn't know anything about a global conspiracy to take over the world.

            Some Jews actually worship Satan. Satanism is a wing of Judaism since Judaism is the mother of all Abrahamic religions. There's an established pattern of Jews engaging in this type of behavior all throughout history. It's called Jewish blood libel. Epstein, Polanski, Seville, the numerous Hollywood pedophilia scandals involving Jews, etc.
           </p>
           <p>
            Jews are at the centre of these pedophilia rings and yet

            doesn't wish to address this because " Muslims and Christians rape kids too! " and because " the Holocaust!" .
           </p>
           <p>
            The thing is, Jews are the ones using pedophilia to further their political agenda.
           </p>
           <p>
            Do your research and you'll come to find that individuals such as Epstein are MOSSAD assets working for the Israeli government.
           </p>
           <p>
            These pedophile rings involve Jewish Satanism and the Israeli government and you're saying we shouldn't notice these things?
           </p>
           <p>
            Fuck off. It's obvious the Jews are in panic mode trying to do damage control.
           </p>
           <p>
            There are people popping up all of a sudden to tell us not to investigate Jews for this... It's pretty fucking obvious they don't want us going down this rabbit hole.

             <p>
              Because MSM usually doesn't report on this kind of stuff.  There are sources but you won't consider them " official"...  Kinda how pizzagate is a hoax if you go by official sources.

              Listen, you're not going to convince this community that Jews aren't involved here when most of the primary players in these pedophile rings are Jews.

            Well, the Khazarian Mafia are hardly representative of all Jews. Not sure I would even term them Jews at all. They pay homage to old, dark deities that Christians would term Satanic.

            Epstein has an owl temple (probably representing Lilith). Bohemian grove features a giant owl. Podesta has a sacrifice to Moloch mentioned in his emails. Moloch crops up again at Comet Ping Pong. It's helpful to understand the occult roots of this circle. It will help us to understand exactly how these people gain power and influence over others. We already know one facet - blackmail over pedophilia, but there are others. Decrypting their methods will give us new leads, and allow us to fight back more effectively against what they are doing.
           </p>
           <p>
            Whenever I see talk about Jews as a unified group, and attribute their actions to this, I do try and correct it. Most Jews have nothing to do with these people (and I would assume have nothing to do with these people). This is a better argument, in my humble opinion, to make. If the media has an issue with it, well.. sorry. They have an issue with us already, and for obvious reasons. They're run by the Khazarian Mafia.

             Rabbinic Judaism is entirely a man-made system of rules.  It was first written down about 500 AD.  It is basically a Satanic movement since it encourages lying and deception.  In the jews' book of Zohar (part of the Kaballah) it advises that Satan needs to be worshipped so that he will not attack the jews.  If you look at the effect that jews have had on every single society in which they have lived you can only conclude that they always bring decay with them.
            </p>
            <p>
             There is also a very old association of white people with Satan (under various names).  I believe that we are seeing a tandem association of white vermin and jewish vermin in this pedophilia/murder/cannibalism thing.  Many white people are just as worthless as the most worthless jew, and we are seeing plenty of that in this investigation.  Some jews still practice human sacrifice to obtain the blood of children for their "religious" rites.  Some white people do, too.
            </p>
            <p>
             Since jews don't have any sort of benign universal religious code to live by, it is no surprise that we find many jews involved in this Satanic cult.  They are victims of Satan/Lucifer, the Grand Liar, the Father of all Liars. Many white people with out-of-control egos are similarly debauched by the Devil.
            </p>
            <p>
             And just a heads-up:  do some research on the "holocaust" and you'll find out it never happened.  Don't let any shill hit you with the "Big H" card.

              I agree with you. The OP is falling into a classical D&amp;C trap. Shunning your fellow travellers on the basis of "inappropriate" topics is a sure way to splinter and weaken the community. Not to mention that the stated goal is a mirage - they will always be labelled anti-semites and much more. Even if they put this place under massive lockdown there's nothing stopping a CTR posting shit in ten seconds and screen-capping it for posterity.

              Thanks for the reply. Yeah - been meaning to research Kaballah a bit, as I understand it's rooted in Satanic ideology. Makes sense that a lot of the Hollywood stars are so obsessed with it.

              Thoroughly agree on White folk getting ensnared in the madness. Not just those at the top either - this culture has seeped down to the bottom, from what I've been seeing on 8chan. Far more widespread than I had imagined.

               A lot of the Kaballa or Cabal goes back to silk-road china, I'm talking +4000 years ago, study hebrew and written chinese, see the similarity, and many parts of China are tied to occult sacrifice of children just like biblical areas
              </p>
              <p>
               Every ppl on earth have their cabal or secret society, ...all is same-same and all ate human flesh,
              </p>
              <p>
               Probably what has happened in modern society is that only the elite still practice sacrificing humans for sex/youth/energy/longevity.
              </p>
              <p>
               Western society has this sick tendency to copy its elite, from silver spoons to white bread, what the elite do today the white-trash emulate tomorow, no wonder everybody in DC want's to be come a pedophile, if its good enough for hillary, trump, and bill, then its good enough for all.

            if that's true, fine - prove it out, but my argument is that there's a massive difference between exposing such ties critically and logically and through a chain of evidence which connects Epstein to the Mossad rather than stating 'it's the jews', the latter of which is going to be very damaging - let the readers figure out the bigger picture

             This is a fact, Epstein was setup in the 1980 to create 'home-shopping network' with mob money, think mossad/whore-house vegas sheldon-adelson money. Epstein was introduced to rich people in the 1990's they were buddy's, up until 2007 Trump/Epstein both enjoyed the Epstein sex Island.
Trump's early money also came from the same mob in the 1980's, trump was always the front man for the mafia on the east coast. Epstein was always MOSSAD, and they need Trump to get introductions.
Epstein via his relationship with Trump was able to compromise almost every politician on the east coast, think clinton. Epstein brought the rich and powerful to his island for sex with children, but it was Trump that always preceded the introductions.
            </p>
            <p>
             U want to know that Epstein is MOSSAD, its all over the internet, how did a guy with no money in 1980's just show up and create his own multi billion dollar shopping network overnight? Just google Epstein-Mossad, you could spend months reading.
            </p>
            <p>
             Sheldon Adelson who owns most the whore houses all over the world vegas and macau, has always been the patron of Trump &amp; Epstein, and Adelson is the owner of Netanyahu. Adelson is another of these child blood suckers like Soros that is 80+ years old and by way of infant tissue/blood lives forever.
            </p>
            <p>
             Same prove Mossad didn't kill JFK, its a known fact, JFK wanted to abolish "Israel Affairs", they killed him, and within a few months Israel Affairs renamed themselves  'AIPAC' and have ran the USA ever since, ...
            </p>
            <p>
             Is the CIA/MOSSAD Jewish? Hell no, is gates/buffet jewish? Hell no, is Sheldon Adelson Jewish? Fuck know he's the world richest PIMP,
            </p>
            <p>
             How Epstein got rich who funded him and his mossad connections is why he's a free man today, and still gets to eat,rape, and kill children just like any other elite.
            </p>
            <p>
             Lastly, the CIA/MOSSAD setup most of the pedophile operations back in the 1940's, super-soldier, manchurian-candidate, all this stuff is real, it required taking children from the parents when young, raping them to create monsters who would later become cops and soldiers, the perfect killing machine, is angry child that only knows pain, has no love or feeling, MK-ULTRA,... how many? There are said to be 10's of thousands of children raised in cages, at lot of this was done at Area-51 back in the 1950's and china-lake, all under the cover of UFO's, but remember most of this stuff goes back to operation-paperclip, and that was bringing all of HITLER's scientists to American in 1940/1950 to setup the CIA/NSA-MOSSAD so that the USA could rule the world forever, back then ISRAEL was only a proxy. Since the 1800's most of the world has been ran out of London, so called city of london, where the richest people on earth plot to control the world, and also the worlds largest consumers of human-baby blood and tissue which is why so many children go missing in the UK. They have the war in middle east and ukraine to cover their baby theft, but blue-beard did the same in the dark ages this stuff is not new, the elite have been eating baby's forever to keep themselves young and healthy.
            </p>
            <p>
             Today the CIA/mossad is just a team of men/women that keep the elite supplied with blood, tissue, and drugs.Not a damn thing to do with religion all is just power, and understanding that if your not CIA/MOSSAD then your are just a farm animal for the elite.

             , you're telling people to ignore the root ideology at the centre of these Satanic pedophile rings.  Judaism is the religion at the centre of Satanism.  Satanism is a wing of Judaism.
            </p>
            <p>
             Jews have been doing these things for literally thousands of years, and also in the modern day era.  There is an established pattern with Jews being involved in Satanic political pedophile rings. Judaism is at the centre of this stuff.
            </p>
            <p>
             You're basically telling people to ignore the root cause of the pedophile rings because " Christians rape kids too!  And because the Holocaust!!!"
            </p>
            <p>
             You're a coward or a shill.

              Every religion in the history of the earth has a long history of child sacrifice, 
Catholic church drinks the blood of christ and eats his flesh, study history and you can learn that long ago  they were not using wine for blood and crackers for body
             </p>
             <p>
              Cannibalism was rampant in Europe until the 1080's, when I studied this stuff when young I remember it said that the selling of human tissue in markets was common in northern europe pre 1100's
             </p>
             <p>
              I repeat all religions killed an ate their children, the western bible is full of storys of ppl killing their infants or handing them over to be killed,
             </p>
             <p>
              pure &amp; simple the elite ( rich ) have always drank human blood of a child for longevity, the holy grail was blood, the fountain of youth was blood of children, ...its been known forever that the secret of longevity is pre-pubscent bood and tissue, what's happening today is that this shit is 'enjoyed' by the elite and like all else its trickling down, like white-bread, ...
             </p>
             <p>
              In general most things the elite get to do the little ppl want too.
             </p>
             <p>
              Satanism is rather new, most western ppl today follow crowley, but luminati, and luciferians have been around a long time
             </p>
             <p>
              It's really silly to talk about Judaism as a root of murder of children, it was rampant in south america, native america, asia, ... most of the world slaves were not human and most ppl in all history have been somebody slaves, and slaves could always be fucked, eaten, or killed
             </p>
             <p>
              Today the CIA/MOSSAD see's +90% of the world population as its slaves, not a damn thing to do with judaism or christianity, all to do with assholes.
             </p>
             <p>
              Since the 1950's the CIA has bred 10's of thousands of assholes to be today's cops and miitary, which is why today law enforcement/soldier are more like robots the elite created this situation, now they have to live with it,
             </p>
             <p>
              Most of the elite super wealth in the USA is not jewish by blood, they could give a fuck about religion, and they only see the public as beasts of burdern

              bullshit - i said no such thing - as a matter of fact i said and implied quite the opposite...

              <p>
               i don't think it's wise to overtly make this connection at this time -- pursue these matters privately, yes, by all means - obviously every lead must be followed and every name exposed, regardless of who is implicated

             <p>
              by "overtly", i meant creating posts with 'it's the jews' titles - connecting the names of people with organizations, intel communities, religious institutions, etc., fine, but i think pinning on the jews in an overt manner is a mistake and since i'm sure you would agree that the stamp of antisemitism would not be a healthy procurement in this investigation, why trot it out at the outset when there isn't even any proof that i'm aware of to make the connection between jewry and pg?
             </p>
             <p>
              and if there is proof, then don't tell us that "Jews have been doing these things for literally thousands of years" - post links and resources that makes this case specific to this investigation and, if you cannot, then you've admitted the lack of evidence to support your claim
             </p>
             <p>

             <p>
              there are probably hundreds of directions that could be forked from PG, but the key right now, i think, is to make the basic case: these children were sexually abused and here is who did it
             </p>
             <p>
              you can't investigate something by naming the guilty party and then attempting to prove your guess, no matter how educated it may be, was right

              Well given that the two richest men in USA that get the most childrens blood, tissue are Buffet &amp; Gates and they're not Jews, its really true that #pizzgate don't have shit to do with Jews in the USA.
             </p>
             <p>
              Now if #PizzaGate was in Palestine, then I might agree that those damn Jews harvest palestine chilren for sex,blood, and organs, but in USA Jews ( &lt; 2% ) are not the problem.
             </p>
             <p>
              Given that #Pizzagate is USA, and USA in particular Wash-DC, and DC is anglo ( think carrol quigley defnition ) bush/clinton type white assholes
             </p>
             <p>
              In summary its really quite stupid to mention 'jews' in the context of #Pizzagate, if in fact its in WashDC.

            How does one peel this onion?
           </p>
           <p>
            I will ask you all  rhetorically Is the CIA Christian? The answer is FUCK NO
Secondly is the MOSSAD 'jew' or representative of Judaism ? Again the answer is FUCK NO
           </p>
           <p>
            Thus one can say that the World Program to murder, rape, and eat children, which has been ran by CIA/MOSSAD since 1950's, when operation-paperclip ( nazis ) were brought to USA to create NSA/NASA, ... have NOT a damn thing to do with Judaism, or for that matter Christianity. Mossad/CIA has much more to do with Lucifer, or Crowley Satanism. In fact CIA created Scientology, which is a sick cult that also mind fucks weak ppl.
Why do they use sex, murder, rape of children, ... The CIA/MOSSAD, well its an old story study blue beard, or dracula, anything you wish and you find that eating children, and drinking their blood has been the 'fountain of youth' since times of old. Look at Netanyahu, or Clinton, Soros, Sheldon Adelson, Buffet, Bill Gates, ... They all seek immortality, and for that they must eat &amp; rape infants, this is a very old story.
Is CLINTON a CHRISTIAN? Is Netanyahu a Jew? Fuck NO, they are all opportunist assholes that don't a fuck about anything but themselves.
           </p>
           <p>
            The USA is a kleptocracy a government  ran by criminals, but their ONLY GOD is money, blood of infants, and power.
           </p>
           <p>
            No real Jew  or Christian has anything to do with WashDc or TelAviv, or NYC, or STL, or any other place that is a bastion for rich elite to use the poor as blood cows.

             We need a new term for them... they're certainly not Jewish, but want to call themselves that... much they way some republicans want to use that name to get elected but work against conservative values... We call them RINOs... perhaps we could get the ever so slightly innuendo sounding JINOs started... because that's what they are JEWS IN NAME
