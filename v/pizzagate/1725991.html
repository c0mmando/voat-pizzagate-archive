            Am i hearing this right?  It sounds to me like Feinstein says at the 10 second mark that they wrote Comey "asking for a breeding(jerks her head quickly right)briefing."   Do Freudian slips mean anything?

            That was the impression you were supposed to have. He appeared to be one of the good guys when he took down the corrupt NY state legislature leaders - Cuomo was next up.  He did a cursory investigation and then let Cuomo off the hook. If he gets Cuomo after the other two, he's a great guy and doing a  real service to take down corruption in NY state.  If he doesn't, he's just helped out his buddy Cuomo to consolidate power by knocking off his two main competitors.  Yeup.

            DIanne Feinstein is as dirty as they get.  She is bought and paid for by the Shadow Government.
           </p>
           <p>
            Senator Diane Feinstein's husband is Richard Blum. He's made billions off government contracts. In 2011 the post office decided to sell a few historic buildings. The buyers were found they just needed someone to do the paperwork. He got the contract and charged commisions in excess of 900 million. Richard Blum and his personal company(which includes DiFi) are the majority stockholders in Comcast.
           </p>
           <p>
            In 2015, the Postal Service has decided to sell 56 more buildings and Blum was selected to do the deal, again. He should make another Billion or more.
           </p>
           <p>
            Dianne Feistein and her husband are also majority owners of Comcast.

             It doesn't matter. Take me for example. I hate Donald Trump with the heat of a thousand suns. I can't stand rich people and I can't stand narcissistic blowhards. This isn't about Trump. In fact the less I see of Trump the better because I can't stand his orange face. It's not about that. It's about people waking up to the Truth about their government's psychotic endeavors and precisely how much unnecessary blood they have spilled.
            </p>
            <p>
             The closest historical precedent to what we're about to go through in the French Revolution and a little known book by Marquis de Sade called "100 days of Sodom". There was no crime, it was total fiction, sort of like a modern day Comet Ping Pong if you will. It's a stretch but you get the idea. People started waking up to what the ruling class had been up to for so long and yada yada yada they started this thing called the Reign of Terror.
            </p>
            <p>
             Trump is part of the ruling class. He could get dumped in a nanosecond and not change a nanoparticle of this cluster fuck.

              Not an obscure book.....though maybe you mean in its day when it was more than obscure, it was not known to exist.
             </p>
             <p>
              Not at all what caused the French Revolution or the Reign of Terror.
             </p>
             <p>
              No crime?  The book was written in prison and DeSade died in a mental institution. (however, not for this book)  The Marquis De Sade was still in Prison when the French Revolution started and they stormed the Bastille, where the manuscript for this book was still "in tiny writing on a continuous, 39.37 roll of paper" which he hid in the walls of his prison cell.  Somebody found the manuscript and saved it and it was first published in Germany in 1904.

              Wow.

             <p>
              I have no idea why you think George Webb knows anything about the NYPD, other than looking up name of the Chief of Detetcives, but if you want to find the video and point to the place he talks about this I'll check it out.    Googling George Webb Boyce didn't turn up anything useful.

               I agree once again but AreWeSure you've got to realize the heavy use of poetic license in the way I write which is to combine facts with humor because it's very hard to discuss the facts in this case without humor.
              </p>
              <p>
               So History isn't repeating itself today. It never really does repeat itself exactly, it just rhymes a helluva lot. And remember my constant drum beat AreWeSure, you and your cohorts don't understand what's happening. That's why you're in this mess.

              <p>
               So when Hillary Clinton says "Basket of Deplorables" your mind doesn't immediately go to as mine did to Marie Antoinette's "Let them eat cake!" (if she even ever said that but whatevs). And it should have because that one idiotic comment lost her the election as it should have because, DING DING DING, we live in the United States of America which you evidently forgot.
              </p>
              <p>
               You get the point, your irrational obtuseness is part of the problem so of course you're not going to see the parallels between a decadent, indulgent and oversexed court of Louis XVI and whatever the fuck is going on down in DC that has triggered the disgust of what will soon be millions of American citizens.

              Excellent summary. I agree completely. I've told friends that if I'm wrong about Trump, and he actually drains the swamp and actually gets rid of the pedos and the overwhelming layers of corruption and inequities on his own, then get the hell out of my way because I'll want to be the first person to shake his hand. But as you say, it's about the much larger truth. It's also about the much larger web of lies that humans have been trapped in since the beginning of our time on this planet. When we collectively stand up and say F you, that's when things will get very interesting. But we can move through that and create a better place and reality than what we've ever known.

            That woman has done serious damage in regards to our freedoms to own firearms, for years and years now. She threatens it with every breath she takes, with every heart beat.
           </p>
           <p>
            I do not wish harm upon her, nor bodily damage - but given her age and her vendetta against being able to defend myself, knowing the passion she holds for it and her dedication to getting that aspect of American Life under her, and others' crooked thumbs, I pray that I read about her untimely passing every single morning I wake up. Sincerely.
           </p>

            Please let her be an implicated part in whatever is about to happen. Please, take her down.

            People in here might be in for a shock. Comey is part of the Deep State and has obviously been involved in covering up the ring for years. He was head of the FBI and did nothing but burry it. Trump cut his own throat when he kept Comey on. He should have been sacked like Brennan. They got rid of Flyn, they have Pence in place as their Trojan horse, and Trump has to continually ask Comey to validate things. The opposite is more likely. The cult has owned western society and it's governing apparatus sine the end of ww2. They are not going to arrest themselves. Question is, what will the citizens do about it? The same citizens that failed their country and never bothered to listen to the people telling them that the cult did 9/11, has been doing fake shootings to disarm the public and controls the State media. Most your friends and neighbors don't believe PG is real and won't look at evidence. And half the PG people can't put two and two together and realize that the cult controls everything. You really think Comey told them "Forget the Russian BS, we are taking down the Rothschilds and their kidnap/rape/torture/murder/blackmail ring that controls worlds governments"? It is a simple question. Do you think that is likely? Is Feinstein not part of the ring? Why would he brief her? Use your heads.

             It was odd that Comey stayed on because Trump could have easily dispatched him.  The logical reason to keep Comey in tact was to keep stability at the FBI for an on-going investigation.  That suggests that the big thing they're looking into predates the election.  We all know the Trump/Russia stuff is complete fiction - my favorite is how they try to use Manafort as some kind of stalking horse.  Manafort was hired by the Trump campaign for like six weeks with the task of preventing the GOP from pulling shenanigans prior to the nominating convention.  There was open discussion from GOP to block him in this way and Manafort seemed to know how that game was played.  As soon as the convention was over he was out and Conway/Bannon came in.  Manafort is not an important figure in the Trump campaign and is not a figure at all in the Trump administration.  He was a hired gun who knew how to get into the mud against dirty people.  This much is obvious to any intelligent person and certainly to people tasked with high-level investigations.  Comey's FBI is working on something other than a Trump/Russia investigation, that much is clear.  It's fair to speculate that Comey 're-opened' the HIllary investigation when the Weiner evidence came to light but was pressured to make his "no findings" announcement prior to the election.  At that time he like most probably felt Clinton would win the election and he'd basically be completely fucked if he didn't do so.  Murdered/in prison for 20 years type fucked - Clinton is corrupt, he knows it, and he would have paid a serious price for doing his job if she and her people were in power.  Trump's victory allowed him to return to his task of investigating high-level crimes and Trump apparently trusts him to see the job through.  The rest of Trumps' appointments and actions are entirely consistent with the "drain the swamp" calls - the Preet Bharara firing in particular.  Preet is an old buddy with Schumer and Cuomo and made a reputation for himself prosecuting Cuomo's competition at the state level, but then giving Cuomo a pass even though literally the entire state knows he's dirty as fuck.  Cuomo was also having him investigate the Mayor of NYC who had the audacity to oppose Cuomo and not tow the the line with the Clinton machine in general.  Note that investigation has been totally dropped now too, to many people's surprise.  Bharara was an easy guy to keep on for appearances and getting rid of him means you're serious about going after the likes of Cuomo and Schumer.

             I agree Comey is questionable, McCabe too. Maybe he simply gave her a heads up of the evidence they and the NYPD have, that would explain her looking like a goose walked over her grave.

            Just found out I am banned from all Disqus commenting!! Wow, funny that, I almost never post on the articles and seldom swear or do anything that would be considered inappropriate
Is this happening to others??
If we all get banned I guess we lose our voices on the Fake News sites(i.e. NY Times, Washington Post , etc etc

            Looks like Comey is now officially Trump's whore. Good. I didn't think Comey would want the video where he's 'jumping Prince Charles and squeaking like a hog' to come out. Better to dance the dance.

             Question: is Gowdy now implicated? Thanks

              I don't know. I would really like to believe he isn't. I've seen this man cry when speaking in defence of sexual harassment victims, I've seen him stand up and defend the weak and the unjustly smeared and I've also heard him recount past experiences that have made an incredible impact on his life with much passion and integrity. He seems like a genuine person, so it would really sadden me to learn that he has a horrible appetite for child sex or child porn. I don't believe he's like that, but you know, I could be wrong. I hope to God I'm not. It would be such a pity.

              It has been said that both Gowdy and Rand Paul were compromised. Comey, McCabe, Kadzik and others at the top are assuredly compromised. It's Howdy Doody time.
             </p>
             <p>
              The only question is if Trump and Sessions are fake or not. Signs point to fake. Where is the law and order? Where is the swamp draining? Why hasn't Trump demanded indictments for Weiner and the Clinton Foundation?
             </p>
             <p>
              Racine, Wisconsin - Paul Ryan's District - is the barometer to tell whether Donald Trump is real or fake. Until he drains that swamp of known racketeering and close ties to Pizzagate and Global Criminal Corruption, rest assured Trump is making deals with the corrupt snakes at the top to protect each other. God knows the real truth, Trump, and soon the people will know. Does Trump want his legacy to be aligned with God or Satan?

             <p>
              NYPD, Wikileaks and Trump may be on the right side of this, but they need to stop slow-footing everything before it's too late. It is time for the people to create Common Global Knowledge of the real truth about Pizzagate and Global Criminal Corruption, and take steps to turn the tables. First to go must be the shadow leaders of the American kleptocracy.

               I haven't heard those rumours and I don't think I could imagine Gowdy being compromised in any way, except maybe being gay, which wouldn't be such a negative thing, imho.
              </p>
              <p>
               I don't know about Trump being fake. I don't believe he's ever, or will ever have sex with children, if only for the fact that he's known to have a weakness for 6 feet tall blond models. It would be really hard for me to believe that he's raped a 12 year-old girl, unlike Bill Clinton or Epstein or Prince Andrew. Afaik, Trump is in a very difficult situation and I sure wouldn't like to be in his position. He's put his business, his family, his entire life on the line to try and 'fix' a broken America.

               Yes, I agree, but it's always easier said than done. According to FBIAnon, there should be a plan, a long well thought-out plan to drain the swamp that's been in place since before the elections. I'd like to think that's true. We're all watching Trump, all sides are. He's being examined, studied, followed, spied on, checked on and he knows this. I believe he's doing the best that he can to drain the swamp in a successful manner, in a way that will not cause more chaos than good. Are we getting impatient? Yes. Are we being suspicious of him? Yes. Are we all hoping that he'll make good on his promises? Oh, definitely. Will we all be ultimately be disappointed? I don't believe so. Should we continue to support him and trust in him? What other choice do we have at this point? So yeah, let's give the man a chance and be a little bit more patient with him. That's how I see things.

                If Trump is not a fake deal maker, he needs to get more wide support before he is ousted from office by proving that he is really going to drain the swamp. The easiest way to do that is to announce that he is commanding Jeff Sessions to begin indictments for criminal corruption in Paul Ryan's district - Racine, Wisconsin. It is a cesspool of indisputable corruption and brazen crimes among officials and their associates who are all members of various secret societies, and it is linked to every aspect of Pizzagate and Global Criminal Corruption. Anthony Weiner and Clinton Foundation tie directly to Racine, Wisconsin. All Trump needs to do is start there so that the entire world knows he is not fake. He needs to show everyone how Pizzagate and Global Criminal Corruption are connected to so many communities throughout America, have destroyed the American dream and the rule of law, and have enabled and condoned the most evil and heinous crimes imaginable involving those acting above the law under the color of law in collusion with corrupt and complicit media and law enforcement at all levels.
               </p>
               <p>
                Why is Trump not talking about Vault 7 and the crimes against American citizens? Every day that goes by with the swamp not being drained is a crime against liberty and humanity.

                 I don't have an answer for you, unfortunately. You raise extremely valid points and I am in agreement with you about Trump needing to act upon the corruption in high places. Do you think maybe more time is needed for the masses to better accept this new reality of Corruption in Government? Or do you believe the rumours of a silent coup being underway in Washington may be possible? I am trying to figure out what is taking this new administration so long...

                  Trump does not have time, and based on the level of corruption that has infested all levels of government, the people have lost their patience and optimism that Trump is on the Good side and capable of draining the swamp. There is no reason to further delay convening a grand jury, ramping up investigations and beginning indictments in Racine, Wisconsin which is a hotbed of criminal corruption, racketeering and other crimes among the elite and secret societies involved.

                    Look into the recent RICO case for a simple example of criminal corruption and pay to play racketeering. It goes far, far beyond that. Many officials in Racine is involved, including the current and past mayors, city administrators, city attorneys, district attorneys, and their associates including many secret societies that control Racine through various forms of collusion. There is also pay to play racketeering connected to the Clinton Foundation and Clinton Global Initiative.

               I have no idea about Gowdy but I assure you as someone who has followed Ron Paul and his son Rand for a very long time, Rand Paul is not compromised.  His father was a congressman with an impeccable record. "They" tried to get rid of him many times.  Rand knew all the pitfalls they were capable of laying for him long before he was elected.  You think he would be such a thorn in the side of both parties if he was compromised?
              </p>
              <p>
               Rand's the real deal.

                Ron Paul was in Congress for 30+ years.  Even if he went in there "clean" (doubtful; see following), there is no way he survived 30+ years in the beltway without becoming dirty.
               </p>
               <p>
                The Pauls are of a NAZI BLOODline.  Paul is a Freemason.  His daughters were members of Jacob's Daughters and Rainbow Girls.  This is well documented.
               </p>
               <p>
                I was a believer in Paul, donated to his presidential campaign (notice that he QUIT twice and never returned one penny of donations!), until learning the above about him.

                 Ron Paul was the most principled man in Congress.  Again..utter B.S.  Anyone who has followed his career would know he was the farthest thing from being compromised.  You need to unbookmark whatever website your getting your Ron Paul NAZI Freemason info from  I assure you it's disinfo.

                Robert David Steele was quoted saying otherwise, that Rand Paul was indeed compromised by Brownstone operations as was Trey Gowdy.
               </p>
               <p>
                The entire Gowdy Comey interrogation was a staged charade. If Rand Paul was the real deal, why isn't he doing more to Drain the Swamp and hold his colleagues accountable for crimes of corruption and Pizzagate related activities. Surely Rand Paul knows about the swamp of corruption in Paul Ryan and Reince Priebus' backyard. Rand Paul is just smart enough to not get too far out of line.
               </p>
               <p>
                If Trump and Rand Paul are on the side of Good, they are very slow and are being outmaneuvered in their fight against Evil.

                  That is correct - he is controlled opposition. Some of what he reveals is true however, and he is right about Reince Priebus being an inside mole covering up for the elite involved in Pizzagate and Global Criminal Corruption.

                   I haven't been convinced one way or the other about Priebus yet but if Steele says he's a mole then it's more proof he isn't to me.  Steele is obvious disinfo agent and using him as some kind of oracle to prove a point is counterproductive.  Your just helping the other side.  Implying  Rand Paul and Trey Gowdy have been "brownestoned"  just confuses  people and causes them to mistrust those fighting on the right side.  Please don't do that.  They need to be supported.

                    What have they done? Rand Paul, Trey Gowdy and Reince Priebus are all part of the system that has enabled Pizzagate and Global Criminal Corruption to reign.
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    Reince Priebus is from the same area as Paul Ryan which is a swamp of criminal corruption and Pizzagate activity. They are the boy scout faces covering up the evil crimes conducted behind the curtain. Until the corruption is removed from Racine and Kenosha, Wisconsin and the people involved are indicted, America will remain a cesspool and playground for the criminal elite who are hellbent on a one world government controlled by corporations under the guise of Agenda 2030 and the rule of secrete societies.

                  We are in agreement (based on more than a hunch), however many times they include factual information that they know will be exposed sooner or later.

                   Absolutely. This is the tactic used by disinformation agents. They mix disinfo with good factual info in order to blur the actual truth.

             I gave up commenting on left-wing news sites years ago, after being banned on three of them, for posting benignly dissenting comments. The nut jobs swooped in like vultures, not to refute or debate, but screaming for those mods to ban me. It was pretty funny and sad at the same time.

            "Russians are coming!" is simply diversion from Global Warming and a 9 foot rise in ocean levels -- 
not in some far distant future but in our near futures.
If public actually understood this capitalism would be over in 2 minutes.

              Global Warming is no ploy.  And many do not understand that we had a 50 year delay in our feeling the
effects of Global Warming which means that right now we are only experiencing the pollution/destruction 
of nature up to about 1967.  Imagine all we did after that time.
             </p>
             <p>
              Whatever sanity is left at our Pentagon they warned "W" in a secret memo of the dangers of Global Warming,
more serious than any other danger including "terrorism."
              <a href="http://www.space4peace.org/articles/weather.htm">
               http://www.space4peace.org/articles/weather.htm
              </a>
             </p>
             <p>
              Couldn't turn up the original memo which at one time made clear all weather conditions from cyclones to storms would be
increasing in number of events and severity.  At one time the memo included earthquakes but it was scrubbed after a few years.
But earthquakes are created by glacier melting because the melting changes the pressure on the tectonic plates.
             </p>
             <p>
              Lies and propaganda have for more than 50 years been spread especially by the oil industry/Exxon and other oil
companies -- in a $50 BILLION dollar campaign to lie to the public.  This also included use of the NY Times' Op Ed
page where ads were run by Exxon which couldn't be challenged nor replied to because they were "ad-editiorials"
             </p>
             <p>
              Actually, our scientists have understood the damage done to the environment since the beginning of the Industrial
Revolution in late 1880's.
             </p>
             <p>
              And oil industry without question understood the reality of Global Warming by 1940's.
             </p>
             <p>
              The Global Warming model was introduced to the public in 1957.
Denials followed.
             </p>
             <p>
              And, there is no way to say how all of this will compound as our scientists make clear.
             </p>
             <p>
              And Pentagon made clear.
             </p>
             <p>
              The most important thing that Trump is doing for Elites is denying Global Warming and that's the most
important thing they need to be done.  That's what all of this distraction of warmongering and "terrorism"
is about.  If public understood the real threat, capitalism would fall in minutes.

                This is nonsense and all you have to do is some of your own thinking to understand the reality of Global Warming.
Rather it's "terrorism" and false flag events like 9/11 which have caused the public to give up their freedoms.

                 Most of the warming occurred in the past 35 years, with 16 of the 17 warmest years on record occurring since 2001. Not only was 2016 the warmest year on record, but eight of the 12 months that make up the year – from January through September, with the exception of June – were the warmest on record for those respective months. October, November, and December of 2016 were the second warmest of those months on record – in all three cases, behind records set in 2015.&lt;

from 1890 to 2000 shows an overall trend of cooling rather than warming, in fact it shows there is no correlation
to co2 and warm periods.
Instead of calling it global warming, which has been decisively debunked, Al Gore and many others are calling it the more
opaque term climate change. Since climate is always changing they will be 'right' no matter what happens, even if we enter a mini ice
age. The crux is that they blame it on the activities of the common man, rather than the elite warmongers.
War is one of the most enviromentally destructive activities known to man, and global warming/climate change
takes the focus right off the culprits. Takes the focus off of chemtrail pilots and their bosses as well.

                 As for the secret memo to George W Bush, I am still reading it, it is rather long. I wouldn't be surprised if it was "leaked" to make the the theory of human caused global warming appear more legitimate. For all the money ExxonMobil is supposedly pumping into discrediting the theory of  human caused global warming, they are doing a poor job of it
, which makes it seem more like they are controlling the opposition to the discredited theory of human caused global warming than actually helping. They don't even stick to their supposed guns on their own

                 . ExxonMobil has almost completely failed to harness Hollywood or the Mainstream Media to the cause of anti global warming hysteria that's for sure, assuming ExxonMobil is at all serious about it. It is actually rather difficult for scientists to get funds when they disagree with the

                That's always been true -- from Day #1 the Founders gave Elites/wealthy immense influence and control over our people's government, the nation's wealth and natural resources.  Plus land grants and protecting the system of slavery for wealthy.

               I did not deny any aspect of the impact humanity has imposed on the atmospheric condition of the earth.   I merly note that pushing the idea that using 'green' technologies like wind and solar will solve all the problems is a ploy.  The truth is because of this push some of the nastiest  environmental scars have been created in lieu these intentions.  The emissions and pollution from the extraction, refinement, and production of the materials in these technologies accelerate the destruction of our atmosphere especially as other countries don't care.  The biggest 'not in my back yard' ploy and it is obvious.  Elon's cobalt batteries are not so nice either.  DR Congo exploits are real and hidden just like pizzagate.

                Whoever said that "green" technology like wind an solar being used long after the damage has already been done to the planet, to the ozone layer, to most of nature would "solve all the problems" .... ?????  Answer:  NO ONE
               </p>
               <p>
                Clearly what was said was that it would prevent adding any NEW damage to that already done.
               </p>
               <p>
                And, of course, with geo-engineering/Chemtrails they have created immense new problems over the more than 30 years they've been secretly been spraying poisons into our skies to block the sun.
               </p>
               <p>
                You're suggesting that wind and solar compare in any way with the damage done from burning coal/Koch Bros/John Birch Society.  Or with burning gasoline in cars all over our highways?  Or with mining operations which scar the lands?
Or maybe with fracking?
When you find yourself arguing an Elite/wealthy or corporate agenda, you can be sure you're on the wrong side of any issue.

                 You note "poisons into our skies", I believe you are noting the silver iodide used for cloud seeding or the lithium indicators used to study wind in the upper atmosphere.  Geo-engineering has some serious ethics challenges and sick elitist tailoring with Crisper-Cas9 technique is more of a concern than most people can understand.  You are right to be concerned with the unethical biopharma and cell harvesting going on.

The minerals refinement emissions regulations addressing the damaging F and Pb gasses and radioactive, toxic, and/or carcinogenic liquid byproducts associated are and will continue to be regulated in the US.

                 The monstrous things that have been done to the atmosphere, rivers and oceans of the earth in lieu of the accelerated production of the ‘raw materials’ needed for most ‘green’ technologies is an inveterate habit of those blind to issues as tyrannical manipulation of the valid intentions and moral identity of the populous.

                 Let me break down the above statement.  The accelerated exploitation of billions of tons of rare earth elements and nasty manufacturing in Asia, Mexico, and other countries cause the some of the worst damage to our planet’s atmosphere and water.  This happened in the US and solid regulations Trump will not remove have protected and will continue to protect our people from some of the most dangerous pollutants and toxins.  The efforts against aerosols in the US are well justified and will continue.  The lack of understanding in how black carbon emissions in Asia have jumped about 60 percent per decade over the last two decades, this is astounding as black carbon emissions are regulated with strong bipartisan support.  Here is a visual by NASA that shows how trade regulations are critical with regards to aerosols and rivers and streams.  Reductions in regulations will promote opportunities for fair trade amongst countries developing the capabilities and systems needed to control the most serious emissions and pollutants, mitigate civil rights violations against miners and promote transparent fair trade.  Don’t let the elite conduct tyrannical manipulations of your valid intentions and moral identity in lieu of their exploits.

                  Solar panels are under warranty for 20-25 years.
There are no moving parts
However, there are no moving parts so the no maintenance required.
 The electro-migration effect might take 100s of years to cause a problem.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  However, by 20 or 25 years from now, there will have been advancements that would make a current generation panel the equivalent of an Edsel anyway. So I would expect that you would want to replace them even if they had not failed.

And they succeed in blocking 25% of the sun's rays.
However, this geo-engineering to control Global Warming has only created immense new problems from spreading poisons into our skies -- aluminum, barium,

                  NASA personnel have come forward saying that lithium, along with other potentially harmful chemicals, are intentionally sprayed into our environment regularly.

                  One of the very basic things we all know about Global Warming and have long known is that we can no longer burn fossil fuels ... that oil and coal most especially.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  Notice that the Nobel Laureate scientists -- and anyone of common sense -- make clear that POPULATION control is necessary to limit any further acceleration of Global Warming.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  Once again -- Trump is doing the two most important things that Elite/wealthy require in order to move on to total suicide for the planet and humanity:  Deny Global Warming and keep women from having control over their own bodies with family planning, contraception and abortion.

                  Actually, Global Warming is costing us all money -- including Elites as damage to the planet piles up.
                  <br/>
                  True some corrupt scientists have made money trying to deny Global Warming, but honest scientists get censored and lose their jobs.
Here's some information on James Hansen whose reports on Global Warming were censored by the W Bush administration.

                  Don't know who's been lying to you about Global Warming, but the majority of scientists support Global Warming.
However, once again, the press working in the interest of Elites/wealthy have failed to report the truth of Global Warming.
In fact, the NY Times gave ExxonMobil space on their Op-Ed pages to run anti-Global Warming propaganda for decades to lie to the public.
Currently, Exxon is under investigation for that propaganda campaign.  The oil industry knew from 1947 onward the reality of Global Warming.

                  The Global Warming model was presented to the public in 1957.
                  <br/>
                  However, "climate change" is a euphemism for Global Warming which was pulled out of the hat of the GOP's chief propagandist,
Frank Luntz during the right wing W administration.  Problem was that Global Warming is something that even a third grader can understand
and they needed a new term to confuse the public and students.

                  And you're suggesting that the glaciers are not melting?  Well, I think you should take another look at recent photos of Greenland.

               If Comey’s briefing had been insufficient, Grassley and Feinstein would both have looked angry and defiant, and they’d have said so. If Comey had given them some evidence that Donald Trump was innocent on Russia, then Grassley would have looked relieved. But the news they received in that meeting was visibly devastating to them both. So much so that the usually talkative Grassley couldn’t muster a word. Feinstein was even making a point of protecting Grassley from having to speak at all, as if she knew that he was in an even worse headspace than she was.
              </p>
              <p>
               There’s only one scenario that could have produced that result: James Comey briefed them on evidence so grave and so damning about Donald Trump and Russia that they both just realized the fate of nation now hinges on their ability to come together and handle it correctly.

              Think i'd come up with a couple of more scenarios what might've made them shook.

               Yep, maybe one scenario is they informed them who had knowledge of a drug running operation spanning Bush and Obama regimes.
 It was busted recently when one of the largest drug busts in American history occurring in the Caribbean aboard a fishing vessel named the Lady Michelle.

               “During the course of the conspiracy, the defendants smuggled suitcases, each containing at least 8 to 15 kilograms of cocaine, through the TSA security system at the Luis Muñoz Marín International Airport (LMMIA). Sometimes as many as five mules were used on each flight, with each mule checking-in up to two suitcases. From 1998 through 2016, the defendants helped smuggle approximately 20 tons of cocaine through LMMIA.”

                It's nice when sites like Guardian need to resort to stuff like that. It's considered "a good source" in this country, but guess its really left-leaning?. They have some sort of disclaimer at the end of each article saying that "there's more and more people reading articles, but less paying for it, please give us money".

                 The Guardian is lousy.  It used to (like 10-15 years ago) often have well-written articles with good research but that is ancient history.

               The Comedy is that we are not at war with Russia. It's like being accused of talking to Canada. But as always, when the deep state accuses others, you know it is what they themselves are guilty of. The movie Burn After Reading even made fun of the two clueless characters trying to get money by threatening to turn over secrets to the Russians. The Russians? How would that hurt us. Wonder if it was predictive programing.

                You/We weren't present so have no idea what the topic of discussion was.  It could have been

                Stop stating your speculative opinion as though it were a fact.
