<p>In the first picture I posted, &quot;timelessdave&quot; is tagged in one of the comments. He was apparently a musician since the age of ten. I\'d just like to point out 4 pictures from his instagram: <a href="https://sli.mg/a/NrkBQl">https://sli.mg/a/NrkBQl</a></p>
<p>Two journal entries from when he was young, both mention being depressed. A picture of a little mer-boy &amp; one of the comments is &quot;Secret Tingles&quot;. And the last is a band poster (I think), and the design is a dead black baby with his arms outstretched. Found this interesting because of all the hints that children are trafficked from places like Haiti.. and also the statements from alleged victims who said they &quot;kill the black babies&quot;.</p>
<p>The original girl in the photo posted a video from Haiti at one point. It\'s nighttime and a bunch of people are singing and dancing. At the very end it cuts to a little girl standing against the wall <a href="https://sli.mg/Hm7IGq">https://sli.mg/Hm7IGq</a></p>
<p>Maybe it\'s all a coincidence, maybe not. </p>
<p>Secondly, another makeup artist connected to the accounts I mentioned posted this: <a href="https://sli.mg/Sdcruq">https://sli.mg/Sdcruq</a>. A picture of Jordyn Jones who has apparently been singing, acting and dancing since the age of 2 and, coincidentally, seems to have quite the cult following of questionable instagram accounts named after her. If you notice the cryptic comment from &quot;evil_eye_cult&quot; - his instagram is full of the same kind of weird imagery and he apparently runs a studio. Some select images: <a href="https://sli.mg/a/1MFBe4">https://sli.mg/a/1MFBe4</a> (masks, crying kid, pentagram &amp; snake)</p>',
