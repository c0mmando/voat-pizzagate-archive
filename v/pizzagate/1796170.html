<hr />
<p>I wonder if this video is related to the leak(ing) &quot;Podesta father&quot; videos showing heinous crimes against children with what appears to be John Podesta and some sort of shower stall. People have said this could be somewhere at Comet, since the lighting is exactly the same. From the comments I\'ve read here, it looks like roughly 95% of you think this is Podesta. </p>
<p>Clearly someone is leaking. People are questioning whether it was the NYPD, as promised. It is conceivable that since they have Weiner\'s laptop, and since <em>somehow</em> Huma\'s smartphone downloaded all of Huma\'s emails, which included Hillary\'s, onto that laptop, the NYPD may be in possession of the infamous &quot;blackmail videos&quot; that pizzagate, and the Franklin Case, are apparently based on. </p>
<p>Other people are saying that Comet is a trap, a distraction, innocent, or at the very least, meant to take us off the track of the \'real perps\', who are supposedly running scared of truthers(?).</p>
<p>Yet here we have a new video leaked from a \'show\' in the back of Comet. Everything about it is very dark and weird. They talk about enjoying satan right in the room, although he actually lives in the &quot;subway below&quot; Comet. The subway likely refers to the tunnel system which could be accessible via basements. The person we\'re meant to believe is Amanda Kleinman, but who may easily be Alefantis (compare arm movements below), is suggesting that with the use of PCP, the group might be ready to go down there. He then talks about the whole block where Comet sits was once known as &quot;crack town&quot;. He says, \'Tonight, let\'s make it crack town again\', suggesting very serious drug use. Both PCP and crack will put a person so far out of normal reality, so far out of their mind, all bets are off. I know from experience. I mean ALL bets are off, anything is possible. You probably will barely remember anyway. and if you do, it will seem like a weird dream, and easy to dismiss, allowing you to feel somewhat innocent and lie to yourself and others.</p>
<p>The drug use explains why we\'re seeing signs of activity that is unthinkable and unimaginable, inconceivable. The ones taking part are sick, the ones leading the charge, are knowingly practicing ancient evil occult practices, satanism in its various forms. And it looks like they\'re doing it underneath Comet pizza after all.</p>
<p>With Besta pizza and Bucks next door, it would be easy for this crowd to move from the concert area at Comet, to the underground area spoken of in this video. &quot;There is no basement at Comet, therefore pizzagate is a debunked conspiracy theory&quot; has been their go-to, even John Podesta used it <a href="https://youtu.be/9R8jA-ebh7M?t=1m48s">https://youtu.be/9R8jA-ebh7M?t=1m48s</a></p>

            Please listen carefully to the video you posted and you might notice the female voice. It's AK!. (Or at least it's a woman)
In all of those live recorded videos you can hear her natural voice overlapping the processed voice at some points. 
Her voice gets modulated by a pitch shifting effect, but since there is somebody standing right in front of her and records her, he is abled to also catch the unprocessed voice that comes straight from her mouth. Just listen carefully and you will see. It's like there are two voices talking at the same time. One quieter (normal) female voice and one louder creepy modulated deep voice.
           </p>
           <p>
            I explained that dozens of times already and everytime I get called shill or even get death threats about it, but I don't care, because I'm 100% certain I'm right. I hear her voice, it's 100% a woman in those live recorded videos at CPP.

             OK, but is it at all possible that what you're hearing as her voice, is possibly also modulated, and you're interpreting it incorrectly? One thing that throws me off, is that we do clearly have pictures of alefantis wearing the mask. So we do know that at times, it is him. and this person on stage acts 100% like a drag queen and 0% like a female, for instance, a female would be very unlikely to get squeamish enough about a brand new baby and its crying, to actually kill it, as the Ape admitted to doing. Women are naturally compassioante rowards babies, especially newborns. But this does sound like something an evil drag queen would say, i guess.

             <p>
              No. I worked with all kinds of voice modulating effect hardware and software plugins myself. What she uses is probably a Boss: VE-20 or something similar. There is no actual way, to make a male voice sound like a female voice or the other way around, without it still being obvious it was modulated to most people, espacially to people like me who are familiar with this kind of editing. Even with the best editing, I still would be able to tell "This voice got modulated."
             </p>
             <p>
              I can tell, there is a deep, modulated voice and a high unmodulated female voice. Would it be the voice of a man which just got pitched up using same pitch shifting technology, I could tell.
A pitched up male voice sounds more like the voice of those "chipmunks", than the voice of a female and I hear 100% female and 0% chipmunk.

              You are probably talking about that comparison that was made from one of MA's (music/studio recorded) videos and the pic of JA where they compared and overlayed the mouth, right?
I admit, the mouth looks similar to Alefantis', but I would like to see same overlay comparison with AK's mouth as well. I compared AK's mouth with MA's in that video, and also with JA's mouth and came to the conclusion they both have a very similar mouth shape and the same ugly grin...
             </p>
             <p>
              So it's no proof for me. I can be wrong about this and maybe JA does the MA in some of the studio recorded videos, but I see no strong evidence suggesting so. Maybe I'm wrong. The only thing I'm certain about is, that in all those live recorded videos at CPP MA is a woman for sure.

              This is nothing but an illusion caused by the gay sounding voice. It's only the voice, that made people think of a gay man when seeing this in the first place. You can get the same effect when you take any females speech or singing and pitch it down. It will always sound like a gay mans speech. This is most true, when you take some speech of a lascivious/ sexy talking woman and pitch it down. It's an instafag guarantee. xD Just try it yourself. Take any audio from a woman talking sexy and pitch it down. It will sound like a fag and very much like MA. Or just take a look at the Olsen twins: gimme pizza, slowed down version music video on youtube. Even this sounds pretty gay already and those are only children. Add the lascivious aspect of a sexy talking adult female and voila, MA gaylord effect. :)

              Because there are no evil women? Women can be like this as well and I think there are enough known cases of women killing their own children or doing wtf not to children for sick reasons to prove that...

              Just go to any of the live recorded videos of MA at CPP, use good headphones and listen. It might take some time, but I'm sure you will figure. It helps when you loop short parts by tapping on a certain spot in the timeline. At some points the female voice becomes pretty superficial and if you listen to a part like this in a loop, it will become crystal clear to you, that you are hearing her actual unmodulated voice.

               Lots to think about. But I am sure James wears the mask sometimes, and yes, the comparison of mouths in one case is overwhelming evidence to me, and does not look like AKs, although in other images it does.

            I didn't get that far.

            In the first video I see the same body habitus (short, dumpy Jewish female with a belly), the same thigh size and shape, etc. that I have always seen in photos and video of A. Kleinman.

             Alefantis is 5'7". He's dumpy. They do have similar body types, and it could be her. But it's not always.
