            TI won't let AJ take control of the conversation
           </p>
           <p>
            They talk about Epstein and Hillary.
           </p>
           <p>
            This one got me heated, and I'm sorry I'm so long winded but pay attention because this is a clear example of MICRO-PERSUSASION and (in my honest opinion) Top Notch DISINFO done by the master,
            <em>
             Alex Jones
            </em>
            .  It all happens in a very quick sequence of conversation, but please take into account his tone of voice and how he uses his tone of voice to bolster the statements with truth.
           </p>
           <p>
            <strong>
             AJ verbally debunks the comet ping pong basement
            </strong>
           </p>
           <p>
            TI calls him out on being not factual because AJ did not actually go look for a basement in person.  AJ rabbles out
            <em>
             Well we've seen the original blueprints of the building...
            </em>
            or something to that effect.
           </p>
           <p>
            But we're talking about THE ALEX JONES.
           </p>
           <p>
            The same Alex Jones who
            <em>
             knows
            </em>
            that obama's birth certificate was a digital forgery
           </p>
           <p>
            The same Alex Jones who
            <em>
             knows
            </em>
            that the 9/11 Commission and the NIST reports were fake
           </p>
           <p>
            The same Alex Jones who not only knows, but FULLY UNDERSTANDS that all of these corrupt agencies can spin up fake dossiers, passports, "official" documents, even the "birth certificate" of the commander and chief
           </p>
           <p>
            Alex Jones has seen it all done before and called people out on fake documents
           </p>
           <p>
            But then goes on to implore us to believe there was no basement because he's seen the official documents.
           </p>
           <p>
            <em>
             "Take it from me in good faith"....
            </em>
            In this game, we cannot.
           </p>
           <p>
            I would feel a bit offended if I was an actual AJ fan, after years of AJ telling them to "make up their own minds", "think for themselves", "don't let the TV and MSM brainwash you and tell you how to think" - he then expects people to just take his word for this particular document.
           </p>
           <p>
            AJ didn't even prepare anything as far as proof to possibly help redpill a new demographic of audience with redpills, they had to search google and scroll on their phones for articles and it made the format so slow, the flow of information via conversation so slow. (assuming they were actually there to accomplish it)
           </p>
           <p>
            -I also can't verify 100% that TI is trustworthy.  He appears quite genuine when he speaks, but silver tongues and all.
           </p>
           <p>
            Alarm bells sounding: For those not aware, ol'
            <em>
             TI
            </em>
            p drill himself did a song with J-Z and Kanwe West called
            <em>
             Niggas in Paris
            </em>
            .  I believe nobody is associated with a person like J-Z without being aware of what's really going on.
           </p>
           <p>
            J-Z is a mediocre rapper who:
           </p>
           <p>
            Wears clothes adorned with Aleistar Crowley quotes
           </p>
           <p>
            Loves to feature symbology such as the pyramid, face of baphomet/baal/lucifer, abstract geometries forming masonic symbolism, all seeing eyes, hand gestures of the pyramid and the all seeing eye, the owl - all the masonic goodies.
           </p>
           <p>
            Is close with Obama
           </p>
           <p>
            Plugs for the Democrat Party frequently
           </p>
           <p>
            I don't know if you can get in bed with J-Z and not get your hands a little dirty.

             <p>
              Right, you see how hard he was moving and controlling the flow and direction of the conversation after he got TI off the bridge?  He was super leading "You know who did have a basement?"  "You know who that was?"  and then boom he's there to answer his own rhetorical question and pied piper with 85% truth and 15% stuff.
             </p>
             <blockquote>
              <ul>
               <li>
                TI does seem trustworthy. He has acted independently outside of the Hollywood blueprint / oversight before, and this seems like more of a father with a conscience move. Then again, he changes his voice depending on his audience, and may be an agent muddying the waters. I have the same questions about Nick Cannon.
               </li>
              </ul>
             </blockquote>
             <p>
              I tend to think that if they are on tv, they are in on it.
             </p>
             <p>
              One could make a case that TI has seen the other side, and said "nah,
              <em>
               I'm good
              </em>
              ", and they were like "well you still have to hang out, come to the award shows, we're going to pair you up and we'll be watching you."
             </p>
             <p>
              But he's also taken the stance that Republican = Trump = Racist = Old White Men, so idk.
             </p>
             <p>
              Good talks.
