            From what I've learned, the Bible is an incredible MYSTICAL text-the problem is that everyone reads it literally.
           </p>
           <p>
            For example: in revelation, it constantly talks about 7- 7 seals, 7 churches, 7 candlesticks. Why?
           </p>
           <p>
            In Hinduism, 7 chakras
           </p>
           <p>
            In Taoism, 7 gates
           </p>
           <p>
            In Islam, 7 heavens
           </p>
           <p>
            These are all books describing the path of inner awakening-enlightenment.
           </p>
           <p>
            This topic requires much more time and space, but all that to say that yes, I study the Bible-and other sacred texts-for the mystical scriptures that they were intended to be.
           </p>
           <p>
            Best to you as well

            I don't think I have all the answers, but I have slowly pieced together my beliefs over 10 years of research.
           </p>
           <p>
            From what I've learned, God is outside of time and space, so our finite minds cannot comprehend exactly how God came into being, just that it has been so from the beginning.
           </p>
           <p>
            I don't believe in a book-I believe the Bible has many errors and many crappy things in it. As I said I'm an Interfaith minister-I find the common threads from the various world systems and see how they fit.
           </p>
           <p>
            I'm not religious-religion is man-made, but I do believe that there is a purpose to our lives. As I said, life is a school. Planet earth is one of many schools we incarnate on to learn lessons. When we die, we go back to our true home-the spirit realm-only to reincarnate into another 'school' when we're ready.
           </p>
           <p>
            This may sound crazy, and it may resonate with some. I don't expect you to believe me-you should be skeptical, and do your own research. That's what I did, and I'm still doing it.

            Have faith, friends. Prayer is the key to the kingdom and faith unlocks the door.  Put your faith in God's ability, in God's Grace and you'll be directed.  On a spiritual level we've all consented to earthly tribulations, even those who suffer bodily harm are spiritualy in God's care.  Our job is to help those in need and by God's Grace we'll succeed.

            I tend to see it more like souls (or whatever you wish to call the combination of humans' neurological programming combined with the concept of free will) being modules of a greater consciousness, that is attempting to filter/cleanse itself, in a way. Send out all of the modules to be tested, and then reabsorb the ones that are not corrupt while filtering out the ones that are. Or for those who believe in concepts like reincarnation, then repeatedly churning the "souls" through this process and only reabsorbing ones when they are ready.
           </p>
           <p>
            If this sort of angle were hypothetically accurate, then it could also explain why sometimes, some very imperfect souls find themselves taking part in greater, virtuous efforts. If everyone who is capable of such virtuous efforts up and left the world with each cycle, then opportunities for souls to prove themselves would become extremely scarce.
           </p>
           <p>
            I thought of this theory the other day when discussing the topic of the pizzagate investigation with someone, and their first, knee-jerk response was basically, "But the people who started looking into that were from 4chan?!" And then went on to use this as the foundation for why they didn't think there could be any credibility to it whatsoever. But my thoughts were more along the lines of.. "Yeah, and why couldn't that be the case? Why couldn't some 'autists' on 4chan happen to notice something that most people would overlook?" While I'm sure there are some trolls in the mix, as well, virtue can spring up from anywhere. Anywhere indeed.

            I refuse to believe in gods, devil, goddesses, demons, dieties, or demi-gods.  They are mythical beings.

             I used to feel the same, so I understand.

            <p>
             The best proof I can recommend to you is to read books by respected exorcists. They use tests to determine genuine exorcisms from fake ones. I'd highly recommend the book "An Exorcist Tells His Story" by Gabrielle Amorth.

             Also my response to another commenter provides a little more info.

            This cause has been questioning my faith. I'm agnostic and I see all of this shit about Satanic rituals and occult symbols, and can't help thinking if they believe in Satan, then there has to be a God.

             I know exactly how you feel my friend. I used to be agnostic, until I discovered a man named Edgar Cayce. He was a regular guy back in the 20's, who by a freak accident began going into a trance state. In this state, he could diagnose people's diseases, and thousands started coming to him.
            </p>
            <p>
             He was a Christian, but in trance would talk about things like reincarnation and karma. He was scared and thought he was possessed or something, but later found things in the Bible confirming these things(for example, in the Bible it says that John the Baptists was the reincarnation of Elijah-but you're not gonna hear that in church!)
            </p>
            <p>
             His 'readings'-as they became known as-also said that there was no one religion that was the right way, but that all have their place.
            </p>
            <p>
             After many years, I can tell you that almost all ancient belief systems agree on these things:
            </p>
            <p>
             There is a Creator(unconditional love), but many of us fell from being at one with this force. Demons are simply angels who have separated themselves from God, and want to assert their own will.
            </p>
            <p>
             Our goal in life is to "return from whence we came", to be the best person we can be, and unite back with the Creator.
            </p>
            <p>
             Forget religion, it's unnecessary and man-made, but connect the dots from each belief system and you'll see what sticks.
            </p>
            <p>
             Another tip to confirm that demons are real, is to read books from prominent exorcists. What you'll find is that they can test someone to see if they are truly possessed. They'll sprinkle fake holy water on them, and nothing will happen. Then they sprinkle real holy water, and the person starts freaking out and attacking the priest.
            </p>
            <p>
             I could go on all day about this stuff hah, but yeah, question what I say, test it, do your research, and keep an open mind.
            </p>
            <p>
             Lastly, Christ is not Jesus's last name, it is a force-a state of consciousness that Jesus and others(like Buddha) achieved.
            </p>
            <p>
             From my research, Jesus is a badass in the spirit realm, so I highly recommend praying for protection, from God, from Christ. Psychic protection is important, especially when you're surrounding yourself with this satanic PizzaGate shit.
            </p>
            <p>
             Sorry if this is scattered but I'm a little buzzed haha.
            </p>
            <p>
             You're on the right track my friend. Above all, know that God is love. These sick fucks can never win-they surely try though.
            </p>
            <p>
             Best to you.
