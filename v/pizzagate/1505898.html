            Thats a great link...it shows all his permits he asked for...or most of them;
           </p>
           <p>
            So he must have got a permit for Bucks...or it expired...
           </p>
           <p>
            Whats weird is he decided to hide his name and withdraw his permit and issue a new one 3 days later with Big Bucks Llc instead of James Alefantis with a change to "benches and chairs";

            It really looked like he was building something big in there and it might just look like some kind of museum.

             BINGO, Alefantis had for years flaunted the law, since 2008 he had removed the entire city council in DC who opposed his liquor permit and late hours, Alefantis had done what he wished, and posted crazy fucking shit on his instagram. We even have a word, its called "Hubris", over time all are infected.
            </p>
            <p>
             The problem is that these people are good, like McMartin the tunnels will be filled, the witnesses will be silenced, these cases rarely ever come to light. Dead men tell no tales.
            </p>
            <p>
             I would look closely at Politics and Prose, they have a basement, they had frequent meetings there where Podesta was speaker, he invited Alefantis to meet him after the meetings. What if behind a bookcase or somewhere in P&amp;P there was a tunnel entrance? The old owner died in 2009, about the time all this shit got going, maybe the new owners of P&amp;P are a decoy couple to put a happy face on the biz.
            </p>
            <p>
             We know besta-pizza (Kline-DOJ) had a "I fuck boys logo", we know the wet-cleaner could have disposed of body's 100% with LYE (sodium hydroxide), we know that Kline's family run's DOT in Vermont and had unlimited access to free undocumented lye for disposing roadkill on VT roads.
            </p>
            <p>
             All the puzzle fits together, not unlike JKF murder, what you need are witnesses and evidence, yet they got away with JFK.
            </p>
            <p>
             Note two days prior to CPP shooting they turned the camera's,, who is to say during that time all evidence and tunnel access was covered up at CPP?

             JFK is still 50+ years old and MSM holds to their BS, 911 is now 15 years old and MSM still holds. PizzaGate is following the same path the conspiracy researchers will follow this shit for decades, but the MSM will always cover for their elite owners.

             Say there were tunnels?
            </p>
            <p>
             Say all the arab owed pizza blocks transferred from ( H. Gill/JDC ) in 2003 for free to CON.NEB ( Arab Emigrates Construction Company ) say that all these building are connected, say the purpose was to 'entertain arab elite'. Say all the tunnels connect to Dupont Circle, then on to the White-House.
            </p>
            <p>
             If any of this were true, why would they want a public record? Why would they allow anybody to know?
            </p>
            <hr/>
            <p>
             What if Andrew Kline (DOJ) is who we thought he was +40 days ago, before CTR shills told us this theory was debunked.
            </p>
            <p>
             What if John Podesta &amp; James Alefantis Homosexual relationship was the key in this investigation? Note that Podesta Group is the largest PR agency for Arab's in DC, that means the Podesta's work personally for the Richest most powerful Arab's that come to DC,, why in the hell do you think they would have chosen this firm, unless it offered special services.
            </p>
            <p>
             All buildings on block are related by the 2003 transfer, and since 2007 Kline/Alefantis ran everything on the block.
            </p>
            <p>
             Certainly CPP is not HQ because Alefantis needed a nearby front to operate, but would not have wanted his place to be HQ. Most likely the HQ is Politic's &amp; Prose, where elite did actually come and go regularly and they held after hours meeting's by invitation.

              If there were tunnels, then they would do it that way because they clearly feel they are above the law.
             </p>
             <p>
              Obviously, Alefantis has a fascination with tunnels and the DuPont Underground has a bit of a gay scene going on.
             </p>
             <p>
              If I lived in DC, I would have gone to check them out, but I am not quite close enough.
             </p>
             <p>
              But, ultimately, these people feel like they are above the law. Saudis buy and sell white girls on Twitter and the slavery of infidels is tolerated in Saudi Arabia.
             </p>
             <p>
              Nobody asks where they get the young white girls.

               But if we make enough of a stink about it, we could really spread our message. Can we get some good "illegal construction" memes made? Something captioned "I'm the 49th most powerful man in Washington D.C.---Can easily get building permit-- I don't-- Build anyway".
