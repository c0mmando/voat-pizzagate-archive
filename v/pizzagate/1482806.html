<p>(1) As is common knowledge to people who followed the Wikileaks developments (and this was known beforehand as well), John Podesta is OBSESSED with aliens.

<p>That by itself is not terribly remarkable, maybe just a bizarre hobby right? Maybe not though...</p>
<hr />
<p>(2) Conspiracy theorist Max Spiers was found dead in Poland this year with black liquid coming out of his mouth. Right before his death, he texted his mom, &quot;if anything happens to me, investigate.&quot; As it turns out, he was investigating both aliens and satanic rituals, and many believe that he died because he got too close to the truth. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;In an interview just days before his death he revealed he believed in the Fourth Reich and Dulce Base - a new wave of Nazi power and a mysterious underground facility where aliens and humans experiment on people.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;His ex-girlfriend Sarah Adams told The Sun that his death could have been part of a satanist ritual, which she claims Max told her about.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He was apparently investigating a U.S. Army pedophilia ring, and according to his fiancee he was about to expose elites who use &quot;black magic.&quot; </p>

<p>I don\'t know about you, but when I hear about someone turning up dead, especially when it concerns the government and elites, I get very suspicious. And that makes me take what they were saying more seriously, no matter how ridiculous it seems. </p>
<hr />
<p>(3) Okay wait, did you just say Nazis? The Fourth Reich? Well there are recently declassified documents which apparently indicate the Hitler DID survive WWII and fled to Argentina! </p>
<p><a href="http://humansarefree.com/2015/02/fbi-quietly-declassified-secret-files.html">http://humansarefree.com/2015/02/fbi-quietly-declassified-secret-files.html</a></p>
<p>And I have heard tons of conspiracy talk about Admiral Byrd\'s mysterious naval task force which was sent to Antarctica shortly after WWII, allegedly to destroy the remnants of the Third Reich which fled there. And according to this old Russian documentary, he had to turn around in defeat because his fleet was attacked by...Flying Saucers!!</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3dD_bhycpCk">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3dD_bhycpCk</a></p>
<p>And we know that Antarctica has been a hot topic in the conspiracy community recently, with John Kerry inexplicably making a visit there, pyramid shaped objects being found on Google Earth, Buzz Aldrin being evacuated, etc. There might very well be something to this. </p>
<p>This also ties into Hollow Earth theory, which is fascinating, but which I\'m not entirely convinced of and would probably take us too far afield. I think that underground Nazi bases in Antarctica is hard enough to believe already. </p>
<hr />
<p>(4) Now, have you heard of this Dulce Base incident? This guy Phillip Schneider claims that in 1979, while working at a secret military base in Dulce, New Mexico, he came face to face with a 7 foot tall gray alien. He drew his pistol and shot it dead, but not before the aliens\' ray weapon mutilated his fingers and &quot;sliced him open like a fish.&quot; This apparently ignited some kind of military conflict in which 66 people died in these classified &quot;underground alien wars.&quot; </p>
<p>Schneider came forward to tell everyone about this, as you can see in the lecture below. Not long after this recording was made, he was dead. </p>
<p>At the 33 minute mark, Schneider starts talking about missing children. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;The New World Order and the Alien Agenda are one and the same. It\'s world takeover and the decimation of the population of this planet. ... There are nine races of alien populations. They look at the human being as a bag of food. They\'re not cannibals, they don\'t use the bones and flesh, They use the glandular secretions of animals and human beings as a mixture of the vitamins for their food. They get high off of our adrenal gland substances, called adrenalchrome. It\'s something like cocaine to them. ... Right now there are 100,000 children totally unaccounted for through FBI archives, cannot be traced anywhere. They haven\'t been murdered, nobody\'s ever seen them. I think they\'re holed underneath in some of these bases and they\'re summarily done away with and they\'re literally eaten.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="https://youtu.be/xedmfAgx8eg?t=33m28s">https://youtu.be/xedmfAgx8eg?t=33m28s</a></p>
<p>David Icke has also talked about this adrenal gland stuff, he believes that not only are the elite satanist pedophiles, but they are also Reptilians (what he calls Archons), and they feed off the energy of children, and get a special high off of sexually abusing them. Could these Archons be just another name for aliens? Or perhaps the other way around?</p>
<hr />
<p>(5) Now connecting this to Comet Ping Pong, there is a mural of an alien playing ping pong there. Also &quot;comet&quot; Ping Pong? Could there be more to the space theme than people would initially assume?</p>

<hr />
<p>Alright, so that was the evidence. Now let me offer some speculation, my theory about what is going on. My theory is that if these aliens exist, they\'re probably pretty damn intelligent right? If, for some reason, they didn\'t want to make their presence known among the general human populace, they could be more or less successful at that (aside from some incidents such as Roswell). But, some elite humans either discovered their presence, or the aliens decided to reveal themselves to these elites. Regardless, they are working together somehow, and perhaps only a tiny slice of the elite actually knows they\'re real, where other slices of the elite merely suspect it (Podesta could fall into this camp). The Nazis knew they were real, that\'s why they spent so much time looking into them and even constructing their own flying saucers (pretty sure that\'s true! Need to corroborate). As Schneider said, there are multiple races of aliens. Perhaps the world wars were a kind of proxy war between them, with one species of alien backing the Allies and the other backing the Nazis. After being defeated, the Nazis and their alien allies retreated to Antarctica, where they reside in underground bases. Some elites are probably aware of this and have been covering it up the whole time. </p>
<p>Now, as high up as Podesta may seem to us lowly humans, when you consider the whole deep state apparatus he could be a fairly small fish (no pun intended). He only suspects aliens exist. But, these aliens need a constant supply of that adrenochrome. So the aliens have set up these Satanic cults, where the initiated (but not quite fully-initiated) think they\'re worshipping the Devil (or Moloch, or what have you). That\'s all their tiny minds can understand, but it serves its purpose (sexual abuse and sacrifice of children). Comet Ping Pong is a front for Satanists. But Satanists themselves are a front for aliens. The &quot;black magic&quot; talked about is actually alien supertechnology. </p>
<p>If this is true, we\'re up against a lot more than we thought we were, that\'s for sure. </p>
<p>If you\'re still skeptical of aliens, I suggest checking out some of this guy\'s videos. Sure, there\'s a good number of things you might be able to dismiss. But I think he is onto something with these UFO sightings, and he is pretty reasonable about saying when something is clearly a hoax versus not. Just recently there was a mass UFO sighting in Turkey, thousands of people were tweeting about it before they were quickly erased by Twitter. </p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/secureteam10">https://www.youtube.com/user/secureteam10</a></p>
<p>Thoughts? I know it sounds ridiculous. But the more I think about it, the more compelling it seems. Are we really dealing with aliens and Nazis and Satanists in Antarctica here, or am I totally insane?</p>',

           Now, as high up as Podesta may seem to us lowly humans, when you consider the whole deep state apparatus he could be a fairly small fish (no pun intended). He only suspects aliens exist. But, these aliens need a constant supply of that adrenochrome. So the aliens have set up these Satanic cults, where the initiated (but not quite fully-initiated) think they're worshipping the Devil (or Moloch, or what have you). That's all their tiny minds can understand, but it serves its purpose (sexual abuse and sacrifice of children). Comet Ping Pong is a front for Satanists. But Satanists themselves are a front for aliens. The "black magic" talked about is actually alien supertechnology.
          </p>
          <p>
           If this is true, we're up against a lot more than we thought we were, that's for sure.
          </p>
          <p>
           If you're still skeptical of aliens, I suggest checking out some of this guy's videos. Sure, there's a good number of things you might be able to dismiss. But I think he is onto something with these UFO sightings, and he is pretty reasonable about saying when something is clearly a hoax versus not. Just recently there was a mass UFO sighting in Turkey, thousands of people were tweeting about it before they were quickly erased by Twitter.

           Thoughts? I know it sounds ridiculous. But the more I think about it, the more compelling it seems. Are we really dealing with aliens and Nazis and Satanists in Antarctica here, or am I totally insane?

            I think there is a simpler explanation for all the alien/reptilian stuff.
           </p>
           <p>
            In the biblical days the "illuminated" leadership created gods and angels, otherworldly, heavenly beings who bestowed their knowledge and power to the ignorant masses.
           </p>
           <p>
            This is simply "Angels 2.0" updated for a modern context and understanding of space.  Still otherwordly, still heavenly beings who are smarter than the ignorant masses.
           </p>
           <p>
            They are probably just talking about the real leadership at the top of the hidden society bloodlines/pyramid.

            It's also free on Kindle Unlimited from Amazon, woot. I am going to read through it later when I'm not able to research. Thanks for the share. There are so many books out there on these things that it's hard to pick one that is a good thorough cover all.

            Anyone looking at these child traffickers you will see a constant alien theme. Lots of alien artwork and they all use the alien emoji. Not saying aliens are real or not  and not saying we should be spreading that idea along with pizzagate but it is definitely relevant to these freakin nutjobs beliefs.

              I have noticed these satanic pedos all over social media talk about aliens, post artwork, and use the alien emojis like they use pizza or the 666 hand sign emojis. From what I read aliens are form of trauma control that handlers use on children when torturing them. Something I read was in children hunting parties the predators would wear alien masks and chase the children around.

            First of all, give your head shake!
           </p>
           <p>
            Nazi's were the good guys, there was NO holocaust ! That was propaganda generated by the Bolsheviks and perpetuated by the Bolsheviks in the US. Yes we were already infiltrated!
           </p>
           <p>
            Second, you are not entirely wrong! NASA, Archaeologists etc etc have been perpetuating OTHER propaganda.
           </p>
           <p>
            The creationist theory taught in the bible is a lie inserted into the bible! And the reason why is to prevent the masses from questioning beyond 6k years ago. That has almost failed but the time has come for total take over by the race that truly believes they are the superior race, not the Nazi's they projected that onto.
           </p>
           <p>
            Our entire world was in fact a science and technology based world more advance than today. We had many races of people who co-existed peacefully prior to about 16k years ago. But there was one race just as sophisticated if not more so in some ways. They dominated their own planet into near extinction, we know as the "red planet", AKA Mars, today. 
We had a war with them that was relentless for over 4k years and off and on before settling back into a pre-science world and starting over again. They are still here among us, they look the same more or less but they have multiple genetic problems due to their own supremacy issues and they can be identified through genetic research and genetic markers.

            Ancient Indian graphics gives an idea of how they are perceived though the depictions are an exaggeration like a cartoon. I am sure if you take your blinders off, you will see them. Many of them are recognizable by their characteristics.

            Literally the ones Hitler was trying to separate from the real Jews. They use the Jews to hide behind, but in recent centuries they have used Islam and even earlier they started using Catholicism as their cloak's. Real Jews need to be aware of how deeply infiltrated they are, as do Catholics and Muslims.

            These facts will be revealed if you keep fighting!

             Thanks for your response! I have also been very interested in Jewish conspiracy theory, and wasn't sure how exactly to make that connection. I have also suspected that this ruling race, whether it is certain bloodlines of humans, aliens, Reptilians, demons, or what have you, call themselves Jews in order to conceal themselves. It really is the perfect defense, because anyone that tries to call them out is immediately accused of anti-Semitism. I think there is also a risk of people getting confused and thinking all Jews are the problem, which could lead to actual hate crimes such as those committed by Neo-Nazis. But in reality, the pseudo-Jew elite actually care nothing for the real Jews; they're used as human shields, probably unwittingly. It always puzzled me, on 9/11, I heard that no Israelis died. They were warned somehow. But I think that at least a few hundred Jews died, and that is touted as proof that Jews were not behind 9/11. Why would they kill their own people? But it makes a lot more sense if you distinguish between real Jews and pseudo-Jews (lets just call them Reptilians for simplicity's sake). They don't give two shits about actual Jews - they're more than willing to sacrifice them for their geopolitical ends. And they're brainwashed to think that gentiles are all mindless anti-Semites (I literally had a conversation with a Jewish guy who said that all gentiles are either anti-Semites, or it is latent/dormant in them and waiting to come out). That keeps them in line, afraid of the gentile instead of afraid of the Reptilian. So then when people start to figure out the Reptilian agenda (or mistake it for the Jewish agenda), then they rally behind and protect the Reptilians. There aren't many of them, but they're given access to positions of a lot of power and prestige so they are able to bring massive firepower (figuratively and literally) in defense of the Reptilians, in the form of media, police, government, finance, etc. You're seeing this happen right now with the media black out of Pizzagate. I think that of the 6 corporations that make up the MSM, at least 5 of them are headed by Jews. They could be Reptilians, or they could be unwitting human shields.

             I have seen some documentaries claiming that the Holocaust was made up, a hoax. There was definitely some stuff in there that made me question, like that the shower heads couldn't possibly have been used to emit gas. But I'm not really sure what to think. Hitler still seems like a pretty bad guy to me. How do you know he was after the Reptilians, and wasn't deceived into thinking all the Jews are the problem? Is it possible that Hitler was actually a Reptilian agent, designed to deceive humanity and ensure Reptilian dominance? They would have no problem sacrificing millions of Jews for this purpose. It gives them the ultimate excuse. How can you object to Israel? The Holocaust just happened. How can you object to their treatment of Palestinians? The Holocaust.
            </p>
            <p>
             On the other hand, I'm open to the idea that the Holocaust was exaggerated or even made up, and that what we've heard about Hitler was literally all lies, and he was one of the few people to actually stand up to the Reptilian menace (which is why they had to pull out all the stops to stop him).

              I believe  Hitler  was a British spy, he is associated with  Tavistock (he  grew up on  the same  block!) there are  no  coincidences (like  this), the  destruction  of  Germany was the  direct plan an implementation of the Zionists, who dominated Roosevelt's  cabinet, created the  Holocaust hoax and  has  been destroying Germany  ever since, partly because Germany was overtaking Britain in world trade and  commerce,  with German ingenuity and precision, and also in  the  larger  sense a Blood feud going back  to  Roman  times

               I could be wrong, sure. But I actually know I'm not insane. The reason is because the evidence is right there for everyone to see. It's not really my fault that your everyday normie refuses to look :) The internet is a safe haven for free thinkers, whereas real life can be quite hostile to anyone who thinks or believes differently. Yes, it also attracts crazy people and racists, but that comes with the territory. Those people exist in real life too. Ever seen a Trump rally?

                 Why have two conspiracies when you could have one? Ockham's razor :) If you have reason to believe in two separate conspiracy theories, for different reasons, obviously we only live in one world (that's my ontological commitment), so if they're both true, they're both true in this single world. If there are two massive, massive secrets, is it that much of a stretch that those secrets would be related in some way? In fact it would be more of an epistemic leap to posit that they both exist, but are not related at all.
                </p>
                <p>
                 I'm only including conspiracies I have reason to believe independently here. I don't include werewolves or vampires because I've never personally seen evidence convincing me they're real. But if, say, I did have evidence for vampires, perhaps I would connect them to Satanists. Obviously both are related to the occult, so there could be some connection.

                  Occam's Razor isn't dumping every nutty hypothesis into one theory, but I think you already grasp that.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  Ontological commitments include causal mechanisms (how did the aliens get here? how does the world generally work? does this account square with other causal accounts of how stuff happens?), properties of the universe (a world with both anthropoid aliens and angels requires evolution to favor "Star Trek" aliens and angels require a massive metaphysical background of god, demons, heaven, hell, etc ), arrangements of stuff in the universe (e.g., we would need to live in a world where alien life is here TODAY - RIGHT NOW).
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  Also, we have to multiply probabilities. The odds of a coin coming up heads is 1/2 the odds of a coin coming up heads twice is 1/2 x 1/2 = 1/4 - that is, the probability gets LOWER as we pack more speculative features into it. Take one conspiracy that has dubious odds of being true. Multiply that by the odds of another dubious theory and the original looks strikingly sane in comparison.

                   Is it really that hard to believe that aliens are already here? I make no assumptions about what they are like (each assumption, like their being anthropoid, would diminish the likelihood of the claim). But if you look at the Drake equation, it is highly likely that alien civilizations exist, just due to the sheer number of stars and galaxies. The only mystery is why they haven't contacted us (Fermi paradox). And the simplest explanation of that is they don't contact us because they're already here, and don't want their presence known.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   So actually if you want to argue against the hypothesis that aliens are already here, you're going to run into probability issues. If aliens exist - as in all probability they do - why
                   <em>
                    wouldn't
                   </em>
                   they be here already? If they exist, and have had millions/billions of years to develop advanced technology, what is to prevent them from visiting earth? Indeed, how likely is it that they haven't visited earth many times already in the past?
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   Combining hypotheses can lead to increased explanatory power. The essence of creative thought is making connections where none existed before - and creativity is required to generate to hypotheses. That doesn't make them true, of course, but IF it is true, then it could lead to paradigm shift where the pieces of the puzzle start falling into place that didn't fit before with two separate, unconnected hypotheses.

                    It is easy enough to believe that there is alien life out there in the vastness of space. It is difficult to believe that aliens are here, in our solar system, at our planet. It's not just that the physical evidence is lacking, but the sheer amount of space out there. Our most likely form of contact would a signal of some sort, an event we are still waiting for at various listening posts (radio telescopes). To actually travel to our little world, there is a VAST expanse of space that must be traversed. It takes light, more than 4 years to get Earth from the nearest star. At the rate Voyager 1 is traveling, it would take 70,000 years. It's not a Sunday drive. The only way to make such travel plausible is to add a science fiction supposition allowing faster-than-light flight.

                   <p>
                    As for the Drake equation, it proves nothing. It is a mathematical measure of one's personal guesses of the likelihood of various events. It's a fun exercise, but not a proof.

                    The Fermi Paradox is not a literal paradox. We do not know what the probability is of an alien civilization being within a radio contact distance of Earth, because the Drake Equation is a Rorshach test. Radio waves (our ears on the sky listen to radio waves) decay in power exponentially, so if we did get a radio transmission from an alien civilization, it would need to be relatively local. We're not in a position to expect to get radio transmissions from any point in our galaxy, let alone the universe.
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    The lack of radio contact is NOT proof that they are probably hiding from us. This is like saying that failing to find scientific proof of Bigfoot is positive evidence of how good he is at hiding from us.
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    Let's note that we're not discussing whether aliens have EVER visited Earth (say, half a million years ago), but whether they are here TODAY, and moreover that they are conspiring with Satanic pedos (which is laughably stupid, on face).

                    For what it's worth, I think your less likely crazy and more likely a troll. In a way, I'd like to join in with you as I used to enjoy listening to Art Bell credulously listen to any bullshit his guests would shovel his way. And yet, as much as it is fun to tell campfire tales, we have a duty to tell the truth and not to mislead the ignorant and the vulnerable. Ideas have consequences.

                     I'm not a troll, I genuinely believe there is a strong possibility that aliens are already here. Haven't heard of Art Bell. But I think it was a lot of the UFO videos on that guy's youtube channel that really made me re-evaluate my stance on UFOs. There's too much there that I can't explain scientifically.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     I believe we have a duty to report on what the evidence indicates, no more no less. No, there is no proof of aliens or an alien-Satanic pedo connection. But I think if you look at the evidence with an open mind, there is something there. I don't think you should go running down the street pronouncing that the aliens are here. But I believe it is rational to further investigate the connection, that is all. The attitude you're taking towards aliens is rather like the attitude most people take towards Pizzagate: it is on the face of it too ridiculous, I'm not going to investigate further with an open mind because it cannot possibly be true. That's fine, in the absence of hard proof I wouldn't expect you to believe. However, I think there is a role for people who are genuinely curious about pursuing a connection further to see where it leads, and they don't have to be ridiculed as insane or a troll by people who don't really think there's anything there. People like me give UFO research a good name because I'm careful and scientific. We need more people like that doing it and less people who are totally disconnected from reality.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     You can choose how seriously you want to take the Drake equation. Like you said, it is fuzzy and we don't know the probabilities explicitly. However, I think at the very least it makes believing in aliens out there pretty reasonable and easy to believe like you said.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     Now, we've only had advanced technology for what, a couple hundred years? There could be civilizations out there that have had advanced tech for thousands or millions of years. Why would we assume they communicate using radio signal, our primitive technology? That's like an Ewok expecting Darth Vader to wield a slingshot. Same goes for our science. We've only been developing physics scientifically for a couple hundred years. Already, things that were deemed impossible turned out to be very true. Why would we expect that our knowledge of physics is basically all there is? That's rather like the people at the end of the 19th century who really believed that science had already discovered all there is to know.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     Again, I'm not talking about proof here. I'm talking about investigation based on reasonable suspicion. Which is the same attitude I take towards pizzagate in general.

               Look around, your schools and scientists are working to cover up the truth. Egyptologist refused to accept geologists views until they took over the perspectives. If they couldn't beat them, they take them over.
              </p>
              <p>
               It is all about maintaining the big lie. Humans will never know the truth without a fight! Humans even unwittingly assist in all these cover ups. Hitler uncovered the truth and tried to fight for it, to reveal it to the world.

                 They need to preserve them selves and they need genetic research, and related technology to help them selves. They are using people to procreate as they have become so inbred they can no longer continue to procreate without their genetics becoming severely compromised.
                </p>
                <p>
                 That is why they are harvesting children, leveraging them for money and power and ultimately using them for research and organ donors.
                </p>
                <p>
                 Start doing research on the number of children that are the product of IVF that become victims of abduction.
