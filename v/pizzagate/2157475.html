<p>“We should not even have this debate when it comes to a child,” Diebolt, said. “There is a difference between curiosity and consent to a sexual act with a 28-year-old guy in a staircase.”
According to Antoine’s legal counsel, the “rape accusation does not hold, because there is an explicit consent of the girl.”
“The only question is whether my client knew the complainant’s age,” said lawyer Marc Goudarzian. “We must distinguish morality from the offense.”
“My client asked her age, she shrugged, he thought she was at least 15 years old,” Goudarzian noted, which is the legal age of consent in France.</p>

            Brigitte Macron, the current First Lady of France, began her 'relationship' with her husband-to-be when he was 15 and she was his teacher, a middle age mother of three. Before and after Macron´s election, the couple was celebrated in magazines and newspapers all over Europe for being
            <em>
             avantgarde
            </em>
            . So what do we expect?

            Age of consent in France is 15. French law is very clear on this. It is statutory rape either way. A child cannot give informed consent, in that they dont know their full rights in a situation like this.

            When the subject of pedophilia is raised in parliament, they just shut it down and walk away. Just look at Belgium.
