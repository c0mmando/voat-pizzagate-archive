<p>Bill Clinton gave a speech in Bergen, Norway, article talks about how the speech was paid for by Robert Whitton, and they say his name won\'t show up on any financial statements by the CF.</p>

<p>Not sure if any of this is relevant, but could be worth digging into more, as there are several articles about Robert Whitton being a hidden donor to the foundation.Robert Whitton was also in the process of building a luxury development in St. Lucia at the time and there was UNESCO red tape and Clinton appointed a new ambassador during this time.</p>
<p>Also an email from Wikileaks warning Podesta and friends about potential speeches coming out, Whitton is mentioned there as well
