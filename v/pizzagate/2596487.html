<p>Adjusting certain values and color channels(among other tools) in photoshop you can usually spot artifacts that would reveal forgery. It\'s extremely difficult to edit a photo where the added layers will change in the same exact way as the rest of the image.</p>
<p>If this image was fake you\'d likely see some strange edges or discoloring that would really stand out in the edited areas. Which in this case would most likely be the faces in the photo.</p>
<p>Since these images have the same effect evenly distributed across the entire photo, with no weird portions standing out in anyway, it\'s very likely the image is real.

            Everyone knows this is shopped. I mean, why would an openly gay man be wearing a flamboyant mask at a gay pride parade? No way that could ever happen. Also Michelle Obama does NOT have a dick. That was all shopped too.

            Just wanted to add some more info about the designer and the seeming push of the occult into the mainstream (because that's how I'm reading this particular little episode now)  ...
           </p>
           <p>
            The designer is Caley Johnson and her designes feature heavily throughout the fashion and music industries. They are exhibited in places like the Smithsonian for christ's sake ..here's an article in the Guardian
            <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/culture/gallery/2018/mar/29/burning-man-goes-to-washington">
             https://www.theguardian.com/culture/gallery/2018/mar/29/burning-man-goes-to-washington
            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            This is her etsy shop: https:// www.etsy.com/uk/people/MissGDesignsShop
            <em>
             [space inserted into url because banned domain]
            </em>
           </p>
           <p>
            And her website:
            <a href="http://missgdesigns.com/category/press/#">
             http://missgdesigns.com/category/press/#
            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            Just read the blurb on this video of her designs
            <a href="https://youtu.be/gA436qYCuJI">
             https://youtu.be/gA436qYCuJI
            </a>
            to see how entrenched she is in the biz.
           </p>
           <p>
            Her biography:

           <blockquote>
            <p>
             Miss G is Caley Johnson, a Colorado native who grew up surrounded by the peaky mountains of Denver. Growing up she had little interest in design or fashion, although she loved crafting and getting her hands dirty.

             Hollywood dreams couldn’t have been further from her mind after graduation when she spent her time studying natural medicine, assisting at births as a doula, performing with a local belly dancing troupe, and saving up money to travel from nanny jobs. She fell in love with travel, and began to take long trips abroad. She traveled across Europe, Australia and New Zealand.  She spent a season working in Singapore. She also volunteered for months at a hospital in Tanzania, where she was thrust into the role of a doula and midwife.
            </p>
            <p>
             She named her small design business Miss Giggle Monster – one of her nicknames from a nanny charge - and began to break into the San Francisco scene in earnest.

            I assumed it was a like a Dominican man or something but at no point did I think it was photoshopped. and the artist collectives are so interlinking its easy to see that these people get around.
Now that the guy he was standing next to is this politician (looked like he worked at a footlocker or something) and I am convinced it is a real photo. Seeing how stupid these people are on their instagrams thats how this board was made reddit saw the going through the instagrams as a witch hunt so they banned

             As often happens with these episodes, they use the Revelation of the Method, tell us what is happening but with misdirection everyone is looking in the wrong direction (Is it Obama, photoshop, blah, blah, blah).  Instead of asking why is this out there in the first place?  Why are 'leading figures' of the so-called alternative community pushing it?  Who is actually behind it?

               The cult of the Holy Spirit (Portuguese: Culto do Divino Espírito Santo), also known as the cult of the Empire of the Holy Spirit (Culto do Império do Divino Espírito Santo), is a religious sub-culture, inspired by Christian millenarian mystics, associated with Azorean Catholic identity, consisting of iconography, architecture, and religious practices that have continued in many communities of the archipelago as well as the broader** Portuguese** diaspora. Beyond the Azores, the Cult of the Holy Spirit is alive in parts of

              It shows that the stained glass window in the McCanns church at Praia da Luz was replaced with a dove one year after she went missing.  I believe it is possible that this has connections with the Espiritos Santo cult and the bank of the same name.

              I had to do a screenshot and then upload it because when I tried to save the jpg of the file that is on his website the imgur website failed it.  Also, I was first alerted to this dove window by this youtube researcher who had a youtube video up in March about it asking what might be its significance but it has been removed.

                Patricia Morrison got her first opportunity to collaborate with Eldritch, but her only verified contribution to the album is one spoken passage on the opening track "Jihad". Eldritch: "So I asked Patricia to come to the studio and told her: 'Speak this – Two-Five-Zero-Zero-Zero'. It took the Mission two months to realise the meaning of those words. Two months!" i.e. £25,000.

It is twice blest. It is twice blest. Rain from Heaven". This code activates a Russian sleeper agent in Faversham (also a reference to the Sisters of Mercy as the Faversham is a pub in Leeds that "was where goth's dark lords, the Sisters of Mercy, would hold court"),[33] Kent to collect a hidden portable nuclear weapon to be taken to Grosvenor Square in London and detonated at 15:00hrs. Also, while trying to get to London Bridge through an unused underground tube tunnel, Lucas North says the sentence "What is lost can never be found"; a line from the "Giving Ground" track.

                 I have a theory that anybody who wants to be in a rock band probably shouldn’t be allowed to be in one. And anybody who’s really good at being in a rock band should be viewed with suspicion. But I think my terror manifests itself in a very entertaining way. And that has afforded me a very comfortable life when I’m not on stage, so I can live with the compromise.

With their “No Future” slogan, The Sex Pistols, formed the same year as High-Rise’s publication, became the quintessential dystopian poster boys. “I can see the connection between Ballard and punk,” says film director Ben Wheatley. “It was an absolutely new voice looking at the modern world and smashing it up. Ballard wasn’t afraid of the chaos either.” At the same time in the east end of London, Throbbing Gristle were busy creating industrial music by sampling the sounds of the streets and fusing it with white noise.

             When I first saw the photo I did think it looked like Obama, but it also looked too white. After seeing this guy Michael's photo I'm pretty certain you're right. Good job!

            &lt; Cleaner version looks even less "photoshopped" in my view - is that a child in the foreground? If real, no matter how you spin it, this seems really bizarre/suspicious. I can't post it on Twitter and have it show up on the pizzagate hashtag feed for latest posts. Google Reverse image doesn't bring it up either. So TPTB are taking it seriously enough to effectively disappear it from the web - this would lend credence to the possibility that this in fact, real.

             It certainly looks like the head of a child, but the picture is taken from quite a distance so its hard to tell.
Also seems like the picture has been scrubbed from reddit, its not showing anymore:

            Great work! I thought it was such a stupid thing to say that a picture was posted on 1/20/2017, therefore that MUST be when it was actually taken! Plus, you have a Chicago jacket on therefore the pic MUST have been taken in chicago.. and I was really concerned that such an obviously pathetic excuse for "debunking" got flagged as 'sharable'?! What? Really lost faith in this sub for a minute.. if the photo is fake, then it's fake and someone with GOOD evidence can convince me.. but an entire argument based on a date and location that is obviously just fabricatednout of thin air is not evidence!
           </p>
           <p>
            Back to the photo at hand.. has anyone found evidence of an "illuminati"/Halloween themed wedding on october 29th 2016(not 100% on the year though honestly)... I looked and found an American Horror Story themed wedding on 10/29/2016 and even one of the cast members was the ring bearer!! And  a lot of the photos had been removed from Instagram(? Or a similar platform), which I find weird.. but they even made their own "video invitation" which was still up.. a lot of ahs-esc imagery too.. deer head, bats, masks, horns... but I am still searching...

             At this point YES, it is time to move on.  We all know he is involved in Luciferian Rituals and Practices.  Yes, the point is to try to verify what is false, but while we are arguing the point, valuable research time is being lost.  We have made enough noise so that Newbies will at least be researching his involvement.  That is what is most important to me.

            If anyone here used to be on reddit there was once a fake AMA with Morgan Freeman. The picture they used where proven to be fake using this method. The paper his username was written on would respond to these filters completely differently than the rest of the image so it really stood out.

            Regardless of your opinion on the legitimacy of the photo,  it is a merry memester's  wet dream.  It's a polarizing image which usually means it will spread like wildfire.  No need to bring in the Moloch relevance initially.  Simply ask if it's photoshopped.   Let the people spread it fiercely.  (Think the dress color debate)

            I did my utmost to match the Obama as moloch and the Obama smiling images, and then I turned it into a gif.  Someone else who wants to do the same, please feel free as this is just one person's attempt / interpretation.

            A little bit of history about myself:  I have over 15 years of photo-editing experience, and with that it's meant a lot of head-swapping for family photos, editing out zits and snot off baby faces, and to my great delight a lot of fandom edits that people think are real.  I'm not saying I'm good, just that I know the area of expertise about as well as anyone else in the field.
           </p>
           <p>
            It is therefore my opinion that the Moloch!Obama and Smiling!Obama images are two different pictures.  Even if I edited out some of his smile lines, there are things that would not match up even if I tried:
           </p>
           <p>
            Moloch!Obama and Smiling!Obama have their heads pointed at ever so slightly different directions.
           </p>
           <p>
            Moloch!Obama does not have the same shaped or happy-looking eyes as Smiling!Obama.
           </p>
           <p>
            You can see more of the "white" of Moloch!Obama's left eye than you can of Smiling!Obama.
           </p>
           <p>
            Smiling!Obama has distinct bags under his eyes from the fact he is smiling.
           </p>
           <p>
            Because Moloch!Obama and Smiling!Obama have their head at different angles, their ears are set completely different from one another.
           </p>
           <p>
            Now, could it be feasible that someone photoshopped a DIFFERENT picture of Obama into this Moloch!Obama image?  I say yes.  But it is my professional opinion that THESE TWO IMAGES that a certain angry muppet keeps saying are the same... are in fact two completely different images.
           </p>
           <p>
            The similarities between Obama in general and Moloch!Obama are uncanny.  It's either him, or a fucking good photoshop (but it was NOT done using Sir Ian's proclaimed "proof" image).

             Very good analysis excellent work. I don't think it's Obama because it would be super stupid for him to go to a parade or a rally in that costume and I don't see any Secret Service agents near him nor do I think they would let him do this. Only a video of the parade or rally will work to prove or disprove the photo one way or the other surely there are videos if it was a protest rally against Trump in Palm Springs or a gay pride parade in Chicago before Obama became a US Senator meaning before 2004 when he was just a state senator.

            I think everyone that has been working on this, whether on one side of the debate, or the other, has done a fine work and made very worthy arguments. This work is done as a service to us, for our consideration, and I appreciate it. OP, thank you for this post and the tactful aplomb in which you delivered it.
           </p>
           <p>
            Now, that said, I hope we move forward. Given the times this has been debunked and then ‘bunked’ again, I have to ask: How comfortable are we that this is legit? I’m comfortable with this explanation, and I’m for sure certain that is Obama dressed as a high priest of Ashtoreth or Molochh.

             I usually only see fierce down-voting in posts when you the posters are right on the money!
            </p>
            <p>
             I myself found some of my own obviously-shopped images and ran them through some tests..... now, fotoforensics (after I figured out what I was looking for by way of looking at several of my own through the service) and other basic photoshop tests I ran indicate this image?  Is NOT shopped.
            </p>
            <p>
             To the asshole saying that 'but look at Obama's smile!! it's the same as another picture!' well, to that numpty I say this: well no shit, Einstein, that's what happens when people smile!  They look like every other picture of them smiling!  He also raged his tits off about "the collar" and that area is vastly different between images.
            </p>
            <p>
             But you know what, I'll bite.  I'll photoshop the second image into the first and see how we get on.

              I was interested mildly at first, but I didn’t think it was a big deal. People don’t seem to care about these witchcraft/Satanism exposures...
             </p>
             <p>
              But now I’m starting to think it IS a big deal (it was always a big deal for me, but the masses are apathetic). Maybe if we keep hammering, the sleeping hormones will wake up to the fact that the people that they ALLOW to rule them are monstrous.
             </p>

              EDIT: I’m no expert, but it seems reasonably real. This last proof from dooob seems helpful.

            . I was afraid Oh_Well_ian "debunk" thread would make people forget about the picture and move on. Thank you for keeping it relevant, it needs a proper and thourough investigation. 
I think there is more to the picture then the alleged Dressed up Obama. The setting seem to be some kind of forest, you can clearly see a tree to the top right. 
But something that really seem to have been overlooked is the robed person standing on the bottom left, both guys in the picture seem to be looking at this mysterious individual. He also has some kind of insignia on his shoulder, and it also looks like he is raising his arm. Maybe in some kind of prayer?

            First - how about the most scant attempt to explain the relevance to Pizzagate.  The error level analysis shows very high contrast rations which is usually indicative of a forgery.

             I left Voat for a month because of Sir Ian, deleted my account and everything.  He's a brash, rude muppet who doesn't understand 'facts not feelings' are the way to extensive and proper conversation.
