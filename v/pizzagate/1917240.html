<h2>Dreamflight -- how the charity began and what they do</h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>According to Dreamflight the charity was co-founded in 1986 by British Airways flight engineer Dame Patricia Pearce and flight attendant Derek Pereira.  Pearce had previously helped organize &quot;Skyride&quot; for the airline, a one-hour ‘Christmas party’ flight.  <a href="http://archive.is/LKW7S">Source</a></p>
<p>Goodness and Harmony adds to this the British Airways &quot;Skyride&quot; Christmas party was most likely <a href="https://c1.staticflickr.com/5/4259/34758801490_ee57ab95ec_o.gif">this one featuring Jimmy Savile in 1985.</a> Pedophile Savile was close to the Royal Family and at least according to David Icke was <a href="http://archive.is/RJ9Lx">a child supplier to the \'elite\'.</a> </p>
<p>G&amp;H also indicates <a href="https://c1.staticflickr.com/5/4275/35105580976_a0e3aee1ab_o.png">pedophile Dr. Michael Salmon (discussed below) and the extremely disgraced Stoke Mandeville Hospital may have been involved in organizing Dreamflight as well.</a>  </p>

<p>The <a href="https://c1.staticflickr.com/5/4213/35105681796_16811d3e6c_o.png">&quot;Sir&quot;</a> died without being convicted for sexual assault of hundreds of children, as well as adults.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Dr. Michael Salmon -- First Chief Medical Officer for Dreamflight, possible organizer</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Dr. Salmon is known to have sexually assaulted children beginning in the 1970\'s.  He was <a href="https://archive.is/QvXb9">convicted in 1990,</a> in <a href="http://archive.is/RgsAV">2015, and in 2016.</a>  He was considered <a href="https://archive.is/DXOkK">associated with Jimmy Savile.</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>He was asked to join the inaugural Dreamflight charity trip....in 1987, as Chief Medical Officer.</p>
<p>The former doctor said he was phoned by British Airways and asked to pick 300 ‘very sick and handicapped’ children who would benefit from the once-in-a-lifetime experience.</p>

           Dr. Salmon is known to have sexually assaulted children beginning in the 1970's.  He was

            convicted in 1990,

            2015, and in 2016.

           He was considered

            associated with Jimmy Savile.

           <p>
            The former doctor said he was phoned by British Airways and asked to pick 300 ‘very sick and handicapped’ children who would benefit from the once-in-a-lifetime experience.

            10 magical days?! That's a long time. Magical for the sick perverts maybe. Some parents amaze me. I can't believe they would allow their kids to go on vacation with these people for 10 days. I wouldn't care if they were doctors, nurses or even a church group! There are perverts everywhere. Even churches.

Another adoption agency that has horrific letters from birth mothers and what was done with their children.  Oh Lord, how much more can we take.

            Two sex offenders both connected to charities called Dreamflight/Dream Flight that takes vulnerable children on trips. I wonder if they hid orphaned children on these flights. Or just children with nobody caring whether they returned home or not. These kids could be sold to other paedo groups or even killed and disposed of.

             Those parents that don't care should be fixed like animals.  What does this say about humans?  Animals don't do this. Other animals take over when some cannot care for theirs, such as cats and pigs that let others newborns feed on them. We even drown animals in buckets of water.  We can be  a disgusting lot.

              Not usually.  When a mother is immediately postpartum she produces a lot of oxytocin.  If her own babies aren't there for her to nurture, she will take in another's brood, even transspecies.  But it doesn't happen that often (which is why it's notable/remarkable/covered in media).  And it certainly isn't a conscious/moral "choice."

               It happened when I was little on our farm and it is happening now.  I have seen it.  Next door to my parent's house on a little farm.  Also, I have seen it on the news. It may not be a constant occurrance to you but I have seen it.
