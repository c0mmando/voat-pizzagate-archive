<p>Now re-watch that creepy Comet Pizza speech:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vlhBn_zSIro">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vlhBn_zSIro</a></p>
<p>Watch the light orb thing on the right...it can be set to do that same red/purple/blue flashing and there\'s a green spotlight flashing to the left of it.  And in fatherhood the light is primarily coming from one spot down low (the light fades into black around the top of the video), just like this orb on stage.</p>
<p>The white light in each.mp4 could be the same light set to just white instead of color and being carried/aimed by the kid (it seems like the kid is trying to use it to see through the translucent wall at who the voice is, at the very start of each.mp4 the kid says &quot;I can see four of you&quot; and at the end the voice says &quot;That\'s me, and me, and me&quot; (those are the lyrics to the end of the Calliou song though so who knows, maybe the voice thought it was funny that it could have a double-meaning)</p>
<p>Anyone know what those walls could be?  Can we find those anywhere in any pics related to Comet Pizza, like in construction photos or in the background of videos or anything?  They sound like plastic when he hits them (I don\'t think glass would have that &quot;rattle&quot; sound they make when he hits them), but I can\'t find any room dividers or shower walls etc with a texture and that bar across the middle in a quick google image search...</p>
<p>Something like this is what I was thinking they might be:</p>

             No, SilvaGunner put together random creepy footage for their ARG, but that doesn't mean they filmed the actual footage themselves (as shown in the debunking video on YouTube).  They got or found the original footage from Worldcorpo and put it in their ARG video just like the other videos they put in there.  No one knows who actually filmed the Fatherhood and Each videos and when someone asked the CEO of Worldcorpo about it he said the screams were real.
            </p>
            <p>
             It's completely possible that Worldcorpo is whoever we're looking for (looks like that pedo scat69 guy, or a collection of people, like the bearded pee-drinking guy etc) and SilvaGunner just found that Each clip the same way we did and went "this is fucked up, this'll be great in my creepy ARG mix" and put it in there.

             <p>
              Back when we were first looking at the kid screaming for help people were talking about how it could be coming from underground because of the way the voice sounds:
             </p>
             <p>
              <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/The_Donald/comments/5dfdj5/comet_ping_pong_a_desperate_child_screams_help_me/">
               https://www.reddit.com/r/The_Donald/comments/5dfdj5/comet_ping_pong_a_desperate_child_screams_help_me/
              </a>
             </p>
             <blockquote>
              <p>
               This may be known or a dead lead by now. The video is taken across the street from Comet Ping Pong. It was filmed in 2007 by some guy for unrelated insurance purposes. In the video you can hear children screaming for "Help me!" , "I am down here!".
              </p>
              <p>
               It is barely noticeable but still distinct and not to be confused with something else. The screams could not have come from the restaurant but more likely from the underground tunnel. In a video filmed in the tunnel you could clearly hear the traffic above.
              </p>
              <p>
               Standing on sidewalk the noise from the cars would have blocked the screams out. But he held the camera close to the ground and it picked up the sound. I can't find any other reasonable explanation for what I am hearing. This is not just some kids whining, it sounds like fear. Remember it's from 2007.

              Bunch of manholes around Comet and we know there's underground passages around there:

              That orb light is likely portable, but the green spotlight that blinks now and then would be more annoying to move around.

             <p>
              Either way they wouldn't be doing this during the day with people eating pizza in the dining area.  Close up shop for the night and drag out some dividers and there you go.  If bands play there they must have some kind of soundproofing so they don't annoy all the neighbors.

               If you watch the father of the family that walks by, notice that they are all completely disinterested in Comet and the two guys playing ping ping outside. The father doesn't appear to so much as glance at them, very common for city dwellers, until you hear the yelling, at which point he jerks his head directly to the source of the sound: from within Comet. Watch again with this in mind. And notice how the two guys stay almost frozen so as not to react, as if they don't hear the screams. I think they are outside as guards for what is probably a private party inside. At one point they also yell themselves just after we hear the children scream, as if to drown it out or something.

               Kid is probably in the tunnels. i remember. They probably put those lights in the tunnels too. If everyone in the neighborhood is in on it, no one would care about the noise

               The voice always struck me as coming from the child across the street, being led by the two adults.
              </p>
              <p>
               My notes from a few months ago:
              </p>
              <blockquote>
               <p>
                <a href="https://youtu.be/oHXBrEXmowo?t=38">
                 https://youtu.be/oHXBrEXmowo?t=38
                </a>
                The loudest scream is 'hey' at the :37/:38 mark. This is when the kid + 2 adults are center frame. Right before the dark sedan passes from the right you can pause on that 'hey' and see the child turned to his left, facing directly at the camera. The child's left arm is up and waving at the camera/cameraman. The man is slightly ahead. Additional 'heys' and yelling continue.
               </p>
               <p>
                <a href="https://youtu.be/oHXBrEXmowo?t=41">
                 https://youtu.be/oHXBrEXmowo?t=41
                </a>
                The man falls back a bit, in line with the woman, and the child previously a little behind the woman is now pulled up perfectly in line and in between both adults.
               </p>
               <p>
                <a href="https://youtu.be/oHXBrEXmowo?t=42">
                 https://youtu.be/oHXBrEXmowo?t=42
                </a>
                The adults turn their heads to each other with the child yelling. A screech of pain is heard from the child, as they man likely grabbed the previously loose left arm of the child.
               </p>
               <p>
                <a href="https://youtu.be/oHXBrEXmowo?t=44">
                 https://youtu.be/oHXBrEXmowo?t=44
                </a>
                The final frame with the child present in view. The childs body has a forward lean as though the adults are continuing to pull him/her forward from each arm. With the lower part of the childs body now starting to trail again. The child is leaning his head back and turned to the left as he/she yells out 'help me', looking towards the camera again.
               </p>
               <p>
                <a href="https://youtu.be/oHXBrEXmowo?t=45">
                 https://youtu.be/oHXBrEXmowo?t=45
                </a>
                The child is now out of frame and yells: 'over here'.
               </p>
               <p>
                In summary, with the vocals loudest directly in frame. "hey, hey...yelling...screech...help me...over here..." followed by repeated "help me" as the child continues on further and further from the scene.
               </p>
               <p>
                Remember, Politics &amp; Prose, and Besta Pizza are both to the camera's right of this scene
               </p>

                What about the very first scream as soon as the video starts (at 0:14 in your video, right at the start in the higher quality version I linked)?  That's as loud as any of the other screams and it happens way before the couple with the kid even appear on screen (it's a good 10+ seconds before the couple comes on-screen).
               </p>
               <p>
                If you follow this guy's manhole cover links:

               </p>
               <p>
                The google map he links shows a street view in front of Comet...this camera would have to be on that island with the fire hydrant probably, right beside 3 manhole covers...sound could be coming out of there, for it to be loud before the couple with the kid walk on camera...?
