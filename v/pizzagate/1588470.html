            : Still no evidence provided that this logo has anything to do with pizzagate. Removing per Rules 1 and 2.

             Ok but FYI I was on an alternate energy YT channel where I had made a comment to the effect that yes free energy is being suppressed but that the vastness of the conspiracy behind that suppression is so great that the reality is that the patents office in the US is administered by SERCO, a UK corporation that runs so many compartmentalized govt programs and services that they are well positioned to suppress any free energy device where the inventor tries to get a patent. In addition to that Field McConnel of abeldanger.net has a well documented series on the involvement of his sister Kristine Marcy in SERCO's criminal activities during 911. Big investment firms were about to be exposed pre 911 , then the towers came down and the DHS and NSA got even more police state powers. However, all of Wall Street is still using the petrodollar and the banksters that prop it need to retain their hegemony through it and what supports the petrodollar you ask? All the things that George Webb talks about in his YT series, I.E. countries toppled and their oil arms and children seized by proxy armies led by the Clinton Foundation and rogue CIA deep state operatives. Quadafi was developing a gold backed Dinar, that threatened the greenback so Hellary sent in Petreaus they killed him and took the loot, but they hit a snag in their 7 country topple plan in Syria, then we had Benghazi happen. Now the globalist puppet masters Rockerfeller Rothschild Warburg et al are using Soros to undermine Trump's attempts to drain the swamp. So to make a long story short, another person commented that I was a conspiritard and I checked out his YT channel and found he was subbed to the Forex trading company that had the pedo logo.. So all roads lead to PIZZAGATE when yyour fucking eyes are opened. You might think you're doing good but you too are a victim of compartmentalization and therefore your focus is too narrow. But I don't have beef with you, all I can tell  you is that those that are opposed to conspiracy theories the most are the ones that are profiting by the status quo of utter depravity and corruption that is currently being threatened by PIZZAGATE, which is just the tip of the iceberg..

              I hear you. If you would make a post laying this out step by step, with links supporting each piece (especially time stamped refs to key spots in Webb's videos), along with a screenshot of the "conspiritard" comment explaining how you found the logo by investigating the commentor, a mod could allow it as evidence-backed post establishing a potential link between the logo and pizzagate.

              If we don't enforce the submission guidelines consistently, we won't be able to remove shitposts from shills, and good stuff will be flooded off the board in hours.

            Well one never looks right under their nose but sometimes the hiding in plain sight rule is just so useful..
Here's their website address too. Don't know how to archive but if it's worth a snoop I hope some one does that.
