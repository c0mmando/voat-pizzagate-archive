<p>Gilbert Chagoury was born in Nigeria to Lebanese immigrants in 1946. He started a flour mill in the \'70s that grew into a conglomerate that covers <a href="https://archive.is/RneL">industries from construction to healthcare</a>. (Couldn\'t archive this one. Help?) <a href="http://www.chagourygroup.com/about/">http://www.chagourygroup.com/about/</a>   
</p>
<p>The Clintons began a friend$hip with Chagoury in \'96 when he donated nearly $500,000 to Bill\'s re-election campaign. <a href="http://archive.is/ASyP3">(Which is illegal for a foreign citizen, so he did it though a voter\'s registration group.)</a> </p>
<p>Around the same time, Chagoury was an associate of the dictator of Nigeria, Sani Abacha. Upon Abacha\'s death in \'98, it was discovered that he had embezzled billions of dollars from the Nigerian government and deposited it into foreign accounts, with Chagoury\'s help. Chagoury lined his pockets as well, and admitted to bribery in a British court. He wound up returning $300 Million to Nigeria, but it\'s still unsure how much he got away with.  (<a href="http://venturesafrica.com/richest-people-africa-2013/">http://venturesafrica.com/richest-people-africa-2013/)</a>)   
</p>
<p>But the deplorable Clintons had no issue taking money from him, as <a href="http://archive.is/jcI3R">he donated $1-5 million</a> to the Clinton Foundation. Chagoury and family members also donated to Hillary\'s first failed presidential campaign. <a href="http://www.malaysiaoutlook.com/the-george-soros-clare-brown-mahathir-doj-nexus-to-bring-regime-change-in-malaysia/">This article</a> is not well sourced, but claims Soros himself channeled money to Clinton via Chagoury. He has also helped Bill secure speaking engagements ($$$).  </p>
<p>His big project now is <a href="http://archive.is/18uOr">Eko Atlantic</a>, an entirely new city built on reclaimed land along the coast of Nigeria. Keep in mind that Nigeria is a rather miserable place. The average income is $2640 per year, and they are riddled with terrorism. Of course the claim is that Eko Atlantic will help the poor with &quot;employment opportunities,&quot; but really it will be a playground for the rich is this very poor nation. ...Bill Clinton was at the groundbreaking. A few weeks after HRC left office as SOS, the state department attempted to buy land in Eko Atlantic, <a href="http://archive.is/AiEUT">which rose suspicion.</a></p>
<p>Since good friend Chagoury has such strong business interests in Nigeria, it has been suggested that was the reason Hillary Clinton refused to name Boko Haram a terrorist group as secretary of state (<a href="https://world.wng.org/2016/09/senators_prod_doj_on_delayed_boko_haram_designation">https://world.wng.org/2016/09/senators_prod_doj_on_delayed_boko_haram_designation)</a>) It would\'ve put sanctions on Nigeria that would\'ve hurt Chagoury.  
</p>
<p>So, there you have it. Just given what we know, anyone should be ashamed to support the Clintons based on this relationship. I have given you a lot to dig into, is there more to find out? The industries the Chagoury Group are involved in, and Nigeria, are trafficking hot beds, is there a connection there? </p>

            Interesting tidbit from this article about another Clinton contact:
           </p>
           <p>
            "A cache of emails that the State Department released to the activist group Citizens United, for example, showed an invitation to Mr. Clinton to speak at a United States-China energy summit meeting in 2012 organized by Luca International Group, which was later fined $68 million by the Securities and Exchange Commission for defrauding investors."
           </p>
           <p>
            So who runs Luca International Group?   Ms. Bing Qing Yang   ( could this be the "card" connection?)
           </p>
           <p>
            "Ms. Yang is an entrepreneur with tremendous experience in the oil and gas exploration and production industry in USA.  In 2005, Ms Yang founded Luca International Group LLC, focus on the oil and gas development in the Gulf Mexico Region. Ms. Yang is specializing project management, property acquisitions, and strategic planning in the upstream of oil industry. In addition, she has successfully started an EB5 regional center with the potential of families allowing them to acquire their green cards."
           </p>
           <p>
            What charges are against her?
           </p>
           <p>
            “As alleged in our complaint, Yang falsely claimed that Luca International was a profitable oil and gas drilling operation when it was really a Ponzi-like scheme preying on Chinese-Americans and EB-5 investors who lost millions of dollars while Yang lined her pockets,” said Jina L. Choi, Director of the SEC’s San Francisco Regional Office.

            Donating to the Clinton is a ticket into the protection scheme. I was clued into this last year when someone who just joined the Clinton Global Initiative said he was "part of the establishment now" (as opposed to just being the tool of disgraced Hollywood pedos) and could get away with stuff you "wouldn't believe". This was bragged to a colleague in jest so it is heresay. I believe the crunchy stuff happens in CGI. Once you join CGI you can be protected by Hillary's foot soldiers in the "child protection system" and she can protect you from "child protectors" (give advanced warning, show up to bail you out of jail, use the full force of her ongoing diplomatic classification to keep on getting the sweet sweet money). Of course, the massive amount of pedophilia being brought onto the world directly or indirectly is a huge stain on the image of the country, so some of these activities could be couched in domestic security... With the breadth of the U.S.'s spy agencies, it is super easy for inside plants (watchtowers) to get usable information on high value people and then show up at their door to sell them CGI memberships.

            I found a connection to an art gallery in California doing charity work in Africa, that seems suspect. The ambassador for that area, used to work for the state department.

            This is a great post. I wonder if there are local nigerian reports of missing children/persons and that trafficking is happening near Eko Atlantic that aren't posted online. As you say its a poor country and its very likely that crimes, kidnappings and other missing persons aren't being reported to police or are being conducted by police. EkoAtlantic looks like a great place to conduct SRA completely undeterred. You're no going to have a bunch of pesky western vacationers taking selfies in the background recognizing their former heads of state.

            As for 404'd artlcles, has anyone actually tried to contact the NYT for a copy of missing articles? I know that you can buy old pages/articles and for a lot of money they will even frame them for you. Or do local libraries still microfilm periodicals? I haven't been a in  library for so long I have no idea if this is still done.
