            Please don't consider this linked to pizzagate, it is not.  It is one out of control OP reaching for straws.   This is not a witchhunt and I think reason has pretty much prevailed, although I am disappointed more people don't reach for the mouse and downvote.  Thanks for your input. OP is a loose cannon and he has shot one over your way but it has landed with limited or no impact hopefully.

            omg this shiiiite submission was actually worth it after all for the lolol you just gave me-  I feel the worst for the poor sweet animals depressed by Trump ha ha.   It really has been over the top all the moanin' and you are a breath of fresh air.  You must feel like the world has gone mad between pizzagate and people's reaction to Trump.  Anyway thanks for the laugh, carry on, and when you have a mind - do speak!  we need some common sense and humor around here.

            Just like the weird pics of kids posing with adults who look like they are holding onto them at the park that is surrounded by creeps in VA, I can't remember the name but it's got at least one post one here about it) and the pics of kids at CPP, those kids are NOT having a good time at whatever they are doing there..

            I look for patterns and have been wondering if OP is a disinfo mole, partly because he tends to sensationalize posts to be like click bait. I took a look at the history, and it was a bit suspect. A CTR tactic is to send people on wild goose chases of no substance (mis-direction), and I would be skeptical in following up on his leads. Since the topic is so important, we do not want to dismiss things without checking the merit, but we need to expose if we think someone may be giving misdirection (either intentionally or because they tend to hyperbolize and have confirmation bias).

            Funny thing is I was like "ho hum another bullshit attention/whore thread with all caps and no meaning" until reading your post falldown, and now I think:
           </p>
           <p>
            Widespread use of child/immature iconography
           </p>
           <p>
            Admitted some pedos have been involved
           </p>
           <p>
            "Skews younger"
           </p>
           <p>
            No shit it skews younger, whole scene sounds sketchy and degenerate, even if it's just bad music and boys who refuse to become men.
So yeah I'm still suspicious...

            Honestly I don't see anything strange here. Maybe this is Americans not understanding Brit culture but let me begin by saying that the Facebook post 'were all dokmed' is about Donald Trump winning the election. How you couldn't have made that distinction is beyond me. My feed was filled with all the Normie's crying about it, and this club seems the place to be frequented by lefties. So that's that.
           </p>
           <p>
            In regards to the pizza thing - pizza is (for reasons I have no idea why) heavily associated with the pop punk movement. I have friends who listen to nothing but, and they sport band shirts with pizza, and even have pizza tattoos. Pop punk and pizza go hand in hand, if I were to guess why I'd say because it's a pretty adolescent, young adult aimed genre - and young adults love pizza.
           </p>
           <p>
            As for the keywords in the art - if we are gonna go after every strangely named club night in the UK we'll be here for a long time - I once attended one called 'cunted'. Yes, seriously.

            Not trying to piss on your bonfire but this thread seems to be very speculative, and the little evidence you've provided seems extremely loose. I'd love to know the source of this tip off - I'm intrigued about that. Without wanting to offend thigh, I'm beginning to believe you have no tip-off - you just said that to make this speculation seem more convincing.
           </p>
           <p>
            I'm a huge believer in Pizzagate, and I've turned many people into it - when I saw this thread I was excited at the prospect of having something else to get my teeth into, but this is silly. Please don't harrass these businesses, it's stuff like this that discredits the whole investigation.

             Since you really want to know just be aware there is a contingent of Chinese Christians that come here with a guy who does very intricate posts like this, sometimes they are something but often not, then he goes bonkers if anyone questions him and sometimes they can really be rude and temperamental -not the usual forum culture.  They are not shills, it seems they are genuinely freaked out over pizzagate, but they have a fundamentalist side to them which usually descends into witchhunt behavior through misreadings of western culture.   Every moon and star symbol has to be Satan worship, everything not Christian is occult therefore Satan worship, etc... They've never seen a Dia De Los Muertos skull, so that's all 100% devil worship, they change identities often and upvote themselves in a group.
            </p>

             There are many strange sides to pizzagate!  lol

            So it's just a venue that sometime gives away pizza to people playing beer pong with Fireball? Or rent the place to some family friendly events? And there happens to be a ping pong club in the same town? Nothing you linked is suspicious.

            Okay, the status about what has this world come to, is obviously about trump. The "climax" comment is sexual because the status says "what is this world COMING to" and the user thought it'd be funny, they're "cumming", to the climax.

            The nightclub having a bunch of children, it could be a private party hosted early at like 5pm, even if it was 7pm... a 7pm-9pm party for kids isn't too unusual. but still, private parties do exist...
           </p>
           <p>
            not defending them in any way, but come on people... look a little closer. we're starting to edge on the schizo side lol.

            OP, other than the pics with kids in this place, you have provided nothing potentially linking this to pizzagate. A bunch of hipsters bitching about Trump being the end of the world is not evidence. I am removing the current flair and flairing this "Accuracy in Question" until more substantial reasons to be suspicious are provided, such as an actual archive or screenshot of the pedophilic Facebook commentary you mention.

             I respect why you did this, however I don't think we're going to be able to find anything substantial  in the first three hours of this info going live.
            </p>
            <p>
             JA's instagram account was a result of being to indiscreet. That is no longer the case.
            </p>
            <p>
             Anybody around the world connected to the scandal has now had 3 months to destroy all evidence they could have
            </p>
            <p>
             Remember besta pizzas logo? Scrubbed. Except now we don't get to see before and after pictures. We have to really look for the signs.
            </p>
            <p>
             Like with the MKULTRA files, in which only a few boxes of classified documents were ever recovered out thousands. It's still all we needed to prove that it did indeed happen.
            </p>
            <p>
             We may only uncover small truths, but they will ultimately lead to the destruction of this illicit establishment.

               I do agree with you there, it is a lot of information that doesn't directly tie in with the pizzagate movement stemming from Washington. This is coming from the UK, and is not as fully-sourced, nor is it written with any real direction. Still, we shouldn't dismiss anything until it has been fully debunked.

            edit: Because OP is acting fanatic and has made no strong connections, I'm removing what I found. I believe all that I found was hipster adults at a party and life drawing class. If there is new evidence I'll provide what I found, but for now I don't want to smear someone.

            Sorry, Im not buying it, and you sure are trying to sell it.   True Secret Pizza drips evil-  this just doesn't go there.   Bombing a bunch of links of any picture you find and trying to stretch some connection doesn't actually build a case.

            People can make little skull puppets without being satanists, it's not even particularly occult.  I feel like I'm talking to Ichiban again under the mask of yet another name.  You need to form an identity and stick with it.

            And that picture of people at the club with kids could be anything.  Are you seriously taking that to be a pedophilia party?  That's clearly women with their children in the foreground - this is not how pedo parties run.  get a grip.

              No, people do take things down sometimes because they don't want to be harrassed.   I get your heart.   but the teachings of Christ are such that he would frown on how you respond to people that disagree with your points.  You are an insulting, angry loose cannon, and I sincerely hope you get help, friend.

            Are you saying the pictures with the kids are related to Club Mingin?  At first I thought you were. Now I realize that you don't know what the pictures with kids are for?
           </p>
           <p>
            Club Mingin seems to be an event that they have only have twice a year.   Club 24 seems to be a place with multiple different music venues.
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             Online ticket sales for Mingin' are only available until midnight on Friday 7th October. After that, tickets will still be available at The Regent and Café Nom De Plume until 6pm on Saturday, priced £8. There will then be a limited number of tickets available on the door at Studio 24 from 10.30pm, priced £10. I hope this all makes sense but we don't want to be at over-capacity!

            What type of one time event?    It seems to be a revival of a club from 20 years ago.  EDIT:  Or perhaps it's just a club night with music from 1995-2005.

            Here's other comments that lead me to this conclusion.   He's dusting off his old records and links to a bunch of DJ tracks from 15-20 years ago.

             Mingin are also very aware of the approaching doom coming there way because of pizzagate. According to its facebook post, posted on 09/11/2016.
This just seems to be about the American Election.    It's from November 9th.

               I'm with you - I think this post is ridiculous.  The worst kind of fingerpointing  OH it's a skull - OCCULT!  Oh people with kids at a club venue. - PEDOPHILIA.
              </p>
              <p>
               I didn't see his smoking gun "post which makes fun of pedophilia multiple times" but I'm a better, and I'd bet $100 it's not what he is presenting it as.  Where's the direct link?  thie screenshot if it's so important?  OP is a loose cannon.

             Yeah, maybe I'm too late and came after they cleaned up? Otherwise I'm not seeing anything here. I'm not trying to be a dick, but now I am afraid to politely ask for a more clear explanation to all this because OP is pretty rude and defensive.

              I do agree that it's weird that they seem to be having a cocktail party at night in a bar that's geared toward EDM or pop punk or whatever and it opens at 7pm etc,  but what's weird is why are there so many children in a bar atmosphere??
             </p>
             <p>
              I been going to bars for years and never one time seen anything even close to that.
             </p>
             <p>
              Rarely do you see children but when you do it's one or two not lots.....

               we have no idea what time of day it is.  No idea what is the context.   This is terrible "investigation".  You notice all the adults in the picture are women?  They look like mothers with girls.   So this is supposed to be busting a big lesbian pedo ring in scotland?  GIVE ME A BREAK- who would go along with this bs?  I am offended by the lack of common sense here - WHO upvoted this?  downvoat now please.

                Actually I went in and counted all the men and all the women and I am coming up with an equal number. But assuming these people are "alternative lifestyle" which is an assumption based on absolutely nothing, then we have no idea what they really are. I agree then assuming they are what they look like I do find it weird that it's evenly matched men and women. Seems like it would be more men? Idk? Are pedophiles mostly men? It seems like it is. But honestly I just don't know.

             It's just confirms what we have seen in US.  It should be in all modern Western Cities just like this.  Of course D.C. NYC LA and other cities I'm not hip enough to know will be more in your face.  Shining light on the evil makes sense to me. Hiding the evil seems wrong.

            Direct linking to them will alert them that their traffic is coming from here and they will scrub or close down if they are actually guilty.  Seriously people, start offering archive links. If I was you, OP, I would delete this thread, get some archive links, then repost your findings.

             I live in Edinburgh. My friends' band is playing at studio 24 in a few weeks and I'll have a backstage pass so I will investigate. What should I look for? Satanic/pedo symbols etc?
            </p>
            <p>
             BTW there's definitely something fishy going on at that place, my friend has played there a few times, and he says there's a baby crib in the band green room(!)

             Thank you for the advice but its a bit to late for that i think. They started the clean up pretty much as soon as the investigation commenced. Perhaps Paranoia played its part in them watching network traffic and have already made certain changes, Policeman removing his career, changing profile pics, deleting pics but i guess they didn't anticipate i was watching there every single move documenting it accordingly, muhahaha

               It shows the scale of the operation. It is global. There is a lot of Masonic ties to Edinburgh.

               This isn't proof for speculative browsing, however if you are as deeply involved in researching pizzagate as the rest of us, then these are some definite red flags. This man has worked hard to compile possible leads, and they do indeed fit the narrative, even if it is written a little scatty. I'm feeling quite scatty myself with all the information I'm having to take in and process. It's just important to stay rational, and not resort to comfirmation-bias. This is what citizen journalism is all about, and I applaud this man.

                If you think there are leads to follow, then fine.  But I know who this is, he's a fundy Christian from China, and they think anything vaguely skull like is a sure sign of demon worship. I don't agree.   He is also militantly insulting to anyone who disagrees, which I think goes against how this forum is supposed to operate.  If you truely find anything of value in the spray of non-info, let me know.   I can say that I think him posting a picture of a bunch of women with children as some kind of pedo party is worthy of the biggest eyeball roll in recent memory..

                 This is true. At ana rt studio I used to work at we had some styrofoam headstones thrown in a far corner, leftover from a Halloween party. Ridiculously cheap with joke inscription, exactly what you'd buy at a Halloween store. A Chinese guy came in a freaked out, ran out and decided not to rent there afterwards. They react the same way to the number four because it sounds like "death" in Chinese; no fourth floors in buildings, all change in transactions goes up one if a four is in the number. Very superstitous.

                  It's a group that seems to actually be freaked out by pizzagate, but are also freaked out by many parts of western culture that aren't Christian, such as any symbol at all of moon and stars.  I've gone around with them before.  The immediate tip off are submissions that look like a lot of evidence and links but go nowhere, long intricate posts.  This was also the guy/group that wanted to "translate" the symbols on the post related to Trolly park- Ichiban.   Strangely enough they are not shills, just freaked out Chinese Christians that are very naive about things that are commonly accepted in Western Culture, such as you can own a Nightmare Before Christmas doll without being a Satan worshipper.   They would be alright but they are always very angry and insulting when criticized at all.  A signature trait.

                   Do you know the name of the group/church? But why so many upvotes from a post with zero evidence and not at all as described in the OP? Maybe they're being used/guided to post here knowing how they are.

                    Yeah, from an earlier go round, I learned they are called "Followers of Jesus".  It is a big and growing group of Christians in China.  But I feel there is another element involved - The OP uses Japanese terms a lot and is well educated.  Seems like not naitve Chinese in Taiwan or Hong Kong part of this "Followers of Jesus" group who it was explained to me don't necessarily follow Western ideas about Christ - he was born of a Virgin which means born during the sign of Virgo for example.  On the other hand, they grew from missionaries in China, which gives them fundamentalist ideas about symbols, and everybody who isn't Christian dabbles in the occult in one way or another in their eyes.
