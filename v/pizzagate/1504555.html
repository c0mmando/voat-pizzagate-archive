In the section from 1:20 - 1:56, Alefantis tries to explain the very suspicious instagram in which a young child is taped down to a table (<a href="https://i.sli.mg/FnGuyR.png">https://i.sli.mg/FnGuyR.png)</a>), with the comment, &quot;New seating area/procedure for your youngest guests. Hilar.&quot; This is one of the many images that show a pattern of strange/suggestive images of young children, along with bizarre comments that fit the narrative that something very nefarious is going on at Comet Ping Pong.</p>
<p>Alefantis\' explanation is that the child is his goddaughter and that the child had been taped down by her sister. Those investigating generally refer to the child as &quot;Caris James&quot; based on the hashtag but we have no actual idea of the child\'s name. People have tried to connect this child with Corey Wren Woolman and Scott Cummings of Lake Oswego, OR (near Portland), but I have not seen anything definitive. Those two would heavily comment on the instagram posts of the young children where jimmycommet posted #carisjames. Here\'s the thing: These two people (Woolman and Cummings) appear to have been in Portland since at least 2009-2010. See <a href="https://thingsthatarerectangles.wordpress.com/2010/01/21/75-portland-natural-caskets/">https://thingsthatarerectangles.wordpress.com/2010/01/21/75-portland-natural-caskets/</a> for a thread to look at history. There is much evidence that they are both in Portland and have been there for years. They are involved in a casket-making business, which just brings a chill.</p>
<p>If this child is their kid, how is this child always unaccompanied by them in these pictures posted by jimmycomet taken from 2012 through January 31, 2015 (<a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1468763">https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1468763)</a>).

<p><strong>I am very confident that the story about her being taped to the table by her sister is a lie.</strong> It was something JA made up as an innocent explanation for something that could not be truthfully explained. <strong>No one has yet to identify who the child in these pictures is, and now we have JA on camera claiming that she has an older sister.</strong> We need to push in this area, maybe with a meme strategy: Using the incriminating instagrams, &quot;Where is &quot;Caris James&quot; and her sister?&quot;</p>',

            No problem. I am hopeful we find evidence that she is alive and well, but I am not confident. If she is alive, I would want someone to really confirm that she is well. No one in the media has bothered to check into the status of his "goddaughter," who was so prominently featured in his many instagram photos with very concerning comments.

            Please clarify. The last picture of Caris on record we can find is dated 1/31/15

            . The pictures with the grandmother (Elaine Deck) from May 2016 do not include Caris, just Mae and the cousin, Quinny. I also do not get why the grandmother's name is not a match for either supposed parent (Deck vs. Commings/Woolman). It is not clear what the family tree is, but one thing that I have yet to see is a recent indication that Caris is okay. #WhereIsCaris?

            Thank you. Strange that there still seems to be nothing at all on Caris (the younger one from all of the images) since 1/31/15. I see Quinny (a cousin based on info in this thread), but I looked through all images and found nothing on Caris. So we see evidence of her sister and her cousin, but nothing on Caris in the grandmother's instagram.

             I really think JA took ownership of her.  I mean he was there when she was born, with her in Europe, and in the stupid GQ picture, and those are the same things.  Not to mention, I wouldntet my dogs put money in their mouth, let alone someone's child.  But I'm not him.

            </a>
            ) using both archive.is and the Wayback Machine. Archive.is saves it without the photo showing on the video link (
            <a href="http://archive.is/EzI3u">
             http://archive.is/EzI3u)

            ), but the Wayback Machine archives a 404 Error page.

            I looked at the heavy breathing video in the comments section on
            <a href="https://steemit.com/pizzagate/@son-of-satire/oh-yes-the-jig-is-up-we-now-know-who-james-alefantis-is-here-it-is-folks">
             This
            </a>
            site and I noticed a couple of things, well 2 things came to mind.
           </p>
           <p>
            Firstly, the heavy breathing.....I'm sure I've somewhere before about a child that was abused for years, whilst she was being abused she would block everything out and only his breathing she'd remember...Hence "heavy breathing"
           </p>
           <p>
            2nd thing I noticed, was them putting their music onto vinyl.....You can hide a message on vinyl and you will only hear it when playing it backwards.
           </p>

            Come to think of it, I don't see how it's better or less creepy if the sister taped her. I doubt the girl carries around a roll of masking tape like other girls carry a doll.  Also, kind of doubt she said: "hey uncle Jimmy,  do you got a roll of tape so I can tape baby's hands to this ping pong table?".
           </p>
           <p>
            It does make sense that it would require more than one person to do the job. Alefantis may have held the baby's hands down. No baby sits still for something like that.

            There's a gay magazine called "Butt," and that's probably what they're referring to, but it's distasteful that they were talking about it in comments on children's photos.

             Its also an easy spin because James Alefantis is a homosexual and Russia is viewed by USA as being an "anti-gay" nation. Probably the same reason they put "Anti-LGBT Protestors" outside of Comet Ping Pong.

            I'm fairly certain Alefantis lied about the taped down child. He first stated the girl was his "niece" on the sidewalk interview out front of Comet. Then on Fox with Megyn, he stated she was his "God Daughter." Find both clips, merge both statements in a vid to expose his lie.

              The child is linked to Woolman/Cummings in this thread...not a relative. We need to compare the two videos. Liars get caught as it is hard to remember all their lies. Please link the investigator video with the niece comment.

               I don't know which video MaryWolf is referring to. I found a sidewalk interview in front of CPP, but he says in this interview that she's his goddaughter:
               <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKTiUaloDDA">
                https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKTiUaloDDA
               </a>
               . If there's another sidewalk interview, I haven't seen it yet.

            Here's a link to the Childcare Centers "partners" in the community. Sure are a lot of them. Some of the names of the organizations are even suspect. Many of them for "at risk" children. Uh huh. If anyone has any free time, here's a new rabbit hole.

              Why would you need to put in a password for a Link to a charity?  If it were a school directory or teacher forum, I get that. That's strange.

               I think those links are for the websites of different Childroots locations. Some daycare centers have webcams, and allow parents to log in to check on their children during the day. You wouldn't want random people watching the feed. But if something sketchy is going on, they could be broadcasting that, too.

             I'm missing the connection. The logo on the pedophile site looks like an Asian character of some kind. The logo on the Child Roots site looks like a flower growing inside or in front of a person.

              Their hq is 55 Main Street suite 200 colleyville Texas. But suite 350 is a 2 bed apartment, could be easier and cheaper option then having an office so could be legit just said I'd relay the info

            Thanks for the pics and info.  Ok I get Scott and Cory could be as sick as JA.  But wouldn't you think this Markee person would want to set the record straight on all the pics of caris with JA?   And I read on one of the attachments in this thread about raccoon eyes.   I don't think they were so pronounced back in the pictures you posted here from 2013.

            Excellent. Thank you. So the concern that is unresolved is: What has happened to Caris Cummings since January 2015, the last documented picture online of a child where many postings occured prior...and her sister, Mae?

            I totally agree!  Wouldn't anyone have questioned him having a child in a high chair in that magazine story?  After looking at those pics again, I think he adopted that child (maybe from them)?  Because of some of their comments to him about the child, like when he was in Europe.  They sound like the baby was there too but not that couple.

             There are starting to be too many "Mae"s, and "Maeve" can be a variation on Mae, this is making me nervous.  John Podesta has an adult daughter named Mae.  It's an unusual name.  What is going on?

            What a great analogy. I'm starting to understand this story. It's not that pedophiliac behavior is occurring WITHIN CPP, on the premise. It's the fact that he and his circle of friends, including the wealthy billianaire Clinton buddies &amp; gov't officials, are involved in state sponsored trafficking which ALLOWS for and enables pedophilia, and Alefantis was careless in his celebration and communication of his preferences through social media and because of his affiliation with Podesta et al, it was inevitable that the link would be made to the wider culture of corruption. So, yes he may be the Achilles heel to the "ring" that brings it crashing down.

              the top left bottle seems to be ALPRAZOLAM

            All I know is if I were JA, I would have already brought in a reputable news crew and told them to explore anything they want in CPP and had any parents of any children post current pics of them with the children and tagged JA in the photo as "proof of life".
           </p>
           <p>
            No one, including Podestas and JA have actually denied any of the allegations.  Categorically or otherwise.  The most any of them have stated is "this is fake news and it is hurting real people (yeah, the children).  Listen to anything anyone of them have said publicly.  They are only capable of assailing the narrative and accusations, without actually denying them.  It's almost like they don't want to lie about what they do - why I do not know.
           </p>
           <p>
            This I can tell you though, nothing JA, DB, TP, JP, HRC, etc. have done convey any sincerity, remorse, or denial of anything.  Their actions are 100% that of someone who at the least, is hiding something.

            I had trouble finding the original archive of this image, but it is relevant for two reasons, first that the dress has pedo symbology and second that the name of the child is identified as "Ceris" (not "Caris"). This may be significant as relates to the theory

             I looked at the heavy breathing video in the comments on that site and I noticed a couple of things, well 2 things came to mind.
            </p>
            <p>
             Firstly, the heavy breathing.....I'm sure I've somewhere before about a child that was abused for years, whilst she was being abused she would block everything out and only his breathing she'd remember...Hence "heavy breathing"
            </p>
            <p>
             2nd thing I noticed, was them putting their music onto vinyl.....You can hide a message on vinyl and you will only hear it when playing it backwards.

             At 1:26-1:29 in the you the one I want video I think it's Alefantis in a tongue costume flashing on and off in front of that face being choked
            </p>
            <p>
             Also, the torn up face at the end with the mouth eaten out and rotten kid pumpkin head represent Changelings.  They believe that after enough rape and torture the children are changelings (their souls die and they are living corpse basically)
            </p>
            <p>
             It's really awful horrid stuff especially when you realize that is sort of what happens.  These children do in a way die yet live after so much torture.
            </p>
            <p>
             In the end most of them are literally murdered.  but until these monsters are "done with them" the poor children are changed and are like living dead :(

              The "rotting head" scene is a clip from the movie "Halloween III: Season of the Witch." It's about a Druid cult that opens a Halloween mask factory in a small town. The cult puts computer chips and pieces of Stonehenge rocks in the masks, and children who watch the company's commercials while wearing the masks die.

             <p>
              I thought the clip of the person with the facial bandages (0:37) was from the hospital scene of Roman Polanski's "The Tenant," but that's not the right film. The woman in "The Tenant" is missing a tooth. The man in the Heavy Breathing video has all his teeth.

              The shot of the boy with his hands on his face (1:31, I think) is from "Over the Edge." One of the characters trips on acid in art class while looking at a Bosch painting.

              crazy,, especially the changeling angle. Maybe the ones they don't kill they're turning into empty shells to fill w/ some entity [or maybe i've just been reading too much crowley].

            There was another pic titled "why does daddy like butt" or something that has the same guy in the "chicken lover" pic with a woman and two kids, if I remember right. Can't find it though.
           </p>
           <p>
            I assumed the guy standing behind taped girl was taking picture into a mirror.

             Yeah his shirt says "BUTT" and its hash-tagged "BUTTMAG" and the caption says "Why does Daddy like Butt?" The pic(s) feature Caris James in a hammock. There are like 2-3 of them, and I'm pretty sure Scott Cummings is in at least one or two of them, and they are tagged with, or commented on by, "ccwoolman" and "scummings."

                If the baby is Caris and the other girl in the hammock is the sister, then add a couple years, fast forward to the tape pic, and yes the sister could have taped her.

             Good observation. There is no way a young child did that tape job. A young child would NOT cross hatch over the sides. They would also have many pieces that were too short. It looks too clean for a child to have done.

            I thought Caris was the older sister. But supposedly the family moved very far away from Alefantis and now lives in the Pacific Northwest.

             There is evidence they were in Portland in 2009-2010. Maybe they moved to DC after, but the whole family history and connection is very unclear.

              says he was in DC, then moved to Oregon, then moved back to DC. Also says he has a three year old daughter (I can't quite pinpoint the date of the article yet but the feature was from 2013 - 2016, so fairly recently.)
Also, I believe the older child in the hammock is called Mae and Caris is the young one. Mae is in some other pics. I'll try and find them. 
Also, the comment "Why does daddy like BUTT?" I believe is referring to the Gay magazine of the same name. Daddy being Scott Cummings, NOT Alefantis as I had mistakenly believed previously. The capitalisation of the word and #buttmag gave that one away.

            If you go about 1/3rd of the way down, there's a a man and woman standing, and 2 kids laying in a hammock. Are the two kids Caris James and her sister? If so, the sister is younger, and not old enough to be taping her sister like that. If that is the sister, I think that's the baby that is sucking on the money.

              He hangtags the parents.. We're they in Europe with him, or did they just let him take their infant child to Europe?? Are the pics with the money and pills from the same time as the one with the baby with the money in her mouth??

             Actually, the child pictured appears to be the younger of the two based on chronology of images and apparent age in the photos. I have dated it from when they show the baby picture (199 weeks with "one year ago today"). Since the picture was captured off instagram recently, it appears that the child is roughly 5 years old (4 years + 1) now. The pictures seem to stop in early 2015.
            </p>
            <p>
             I have thought that maybe these kids in the hammock are sisters, but there is no way such a young child go do such a tape job. Why is this younger child the subject of so many strange pictures and comments, a huge pattern? The child does not look well.

            The masking tape on her forearms and hands was obviously cut with scissors to perfection - NOT something that two little girls would do when playing; and besides, who lets their little kids play with scissors? It is so obvious that an adult cut and placed the tape. Megyn Kelly is guilty of overlooking child abuse.

             Exactly!  And I think it's in the YT interview of alafantis, he said she was taped there by a younger girl.  NO WAY could a younger girl, probably smaller, get that tape on her like that, even standing on a chair.  No way!  I will find the YT link tonight. Is the welfare of that girl something covered under FOIA?  Probably not, but is there ANY County child protection services that would care????

             Child from a previous marriage? Basically it could just be an older sister who has to babysit, takes the kid out, gets annoyed and tapes her to the table as a joke. Kid is smiling. Sometimes the easiest explanations are correct.

              No Megyn Kelly fan, but if she was going to ask about just one picture, she picked a good one. PLUS she got him to say that her sister did it and her parents were near by. It's something else to catch him in a lie.

             I don't think the "he" was intended to refer to the baby because of course JA would know Caris was a girl. Who the "he" is is a good question, however.

                 Oh wait, you're right, there's a woman in Portland Oregon that is the birth mother, possibly AJ. She wrote a letter along with a host of others including Charles Gibson (another news guy) in defense of someone being tried/sentenced for pedophilia. I see pattern of women donating their children to the cult.

                   Sorry, I tried finding the post I saw a month ago but couldn't find it. But it was a coach that had been abusing students since the 60's or 70's. The mother of Caris, Corey Woolman, see OP's update, wrote a character reference for him. Charles Gibson not Goodman was also a reference if I remember correctly. The post was outside of Voat.

                      This article identifies Susan as James' sister, but IIRC, later info identified her as his mother. The letter was in support of Christopher Kloman.

                       Thank you very much. I thought I saw woolman wrote a letter too, but it's not saying it here. There were over 90 people writing letters. I'll give pedophiles one thing, they sure are loyal to each other.

            Yes. The little girl has horrible bags under her eyes in these pictures and does not look healthy. Someone compiled most (if not all) key instagram posts here, including the one drinking the milk with the "what's your secret" message on the side of the milk cartion:
            <a href="https://imgur.com/a/BEY2B">

           </p>
           <p>
            The CarisJames being linked to the actual name of the child has been speculative. Some have pointed out that Caris is the shortened form of a rape drug. The appendage of "James" is very strange for a female child. I have seen no evidence of the child's real name, the name of the parents, the name of the sister, or their well being.

             I have a theory about the James part. It could be her actual middle name...I wouldn't put it past gender-bending hipsters to give a male middle name to a girl.

             She is apparently the daughter of one Scott Cummings, who is married to a Cory Woolman.

            <p>
             Their instagrams are (or were, before they mysteriously set to private) woolmings.fam and woolmings_family, ostensibly a combination of their last names (Woolman and Cummings). They also had the accounts ccwoolman and scummings; I’m a little suspicious why they used so many accounts, but I digress."

            I guess VOAT doesn't really have a search feature.  But the girl is the child of Scott Cummings and Cory Woolman and her name is Caris Cummings and people have found more recent photos of her.  She is not missing, so why the meme?

             I looked at your history. It seems you do little to further any leads but regularly post caution responses, nothing here to look at...move on, without a shred of documentation. Please document your bold claim as I have seen none.

               With a name like AreWeSure, it kind of seems like his motive is to get everyone to second-guess things that we've been considering "true" all this time. Not sure if he's misguided or a shill.

             Have we identified Caris' sister then? Kinda thought that was one of the main points of the thread. If no sister [or if her sister is that infant] then JA's bullsht story holds no water..

             Where is your evidence of this? Where is the proof that Cummings/Woolman are the parents and are caring for thee kids? Explain how these parents, who have been in Portland since 2009 based on research, have many images associated with Comet Ping Pong, clear across the country, with some images right in the restaurant. You claim people have found more recent photos of her. Please post links to these. And what evidence do we have these children are with their parents in Portland and are well?

                 I guess it was just too small on my screen.  I see in your blow-up it does look like a spiral.  Spirals aren't exactly unique to pedophilia though.

            I just have to give you credit for having the ability to watch that bullshit Megyn Kelly"interview" again. I nearly put my fist through the TV the first time. But, yes, I agree... this does need more investigating for sure. As a parent myself, I could tell you 100% that I would immediately put an end to any speculation surrounding my child, and CP/trafficking. But, that has not happened. Which is quite telling in itself.

             Megyn Kelly is a woman and doesn't give a sh.t if that girl is ok, although she has a TV show!

             I totally agree with everything you said.  And unfortunately, parents that do partake in this evil stuff, seem to have no problem trusting their children to people as evil as themseves.   So if this girl's parents do know about the pictures, I'm sure they're proud of it.

             Exactly.  I have 6 children.  I would be horrified if a photo of one of my children was circulating in relations to pedophelia, satanism and trafficking.  Absolutely horrified.  I would go to as many media outlets as possible to clear myself and reassure the public that my daughter is fine.

             He called her his goddaughter in a YouTube video of someone questioning him on the street in front of Comet.

            <p>
             It's very possible this little girl is his godchild and is fine, but why haven't her parents come out to say that?

              Goddaughter status... is that a matter of public record?  I don't think it is, and that might be one reason JA made the claim: if it's not public record, there's no way to easily fact-check the claim.

               "Goddaughter" would be a matter of record with the sponsoring Catholic church, as best as I can tell. I don't have any idea if comprehensive records are kept on such matters, as the government does with birth and death records however.

             I agree. I feel this way too. I would do the same thing especially if my child's images were being shifted around all over the internet and what it was about. I would definitely go on the record with my kid in front of the cameras to let everyone know it wasn't true.

            I thought of this too. The picture was taken too high to be by the sister. Tape was too well applied to be done by a young sister and, she would have been in the photo with a giddy "I did it grin". I have no idea how to prove he is lying.

             No one said her sister took the photo; he just said her sister taped her to the table. The tape job does seem to be too neat for a kid to do, but I suppose it's possible. I always assumed an adult took the photo, however.

            Good catch!! Alefantis is definitely the weak link as he seems to shoot from the hip when asked questions and is consistently caught lying. As well as tracking down the info above we should review all comments/interviews from Alefantis as it's likely he'll have made more errors [i'm thinking the first curb side interview at comet before the shooter. Once we've done that and can concisely compile a list of his lies the media needs to be challenged. [clips of the msm calling Brietbart a liar on Wienergate comes to mind]

            Being devil's advocate for a second but is it possible she is the one taking the photos and that is why she is never in them?
           </p>
           <p>
            Anyway, what is odd is that the family have not, so far as I know, come forward to publicly support Alefantis and claim the child is theirs and is indeed his god-daughter.

            sounds like another case of "a friend of mine" to me.
But actually this could be pretty important. If we can prove he lied in this interview we'Re a huge step closer to our goal
