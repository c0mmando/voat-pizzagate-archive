<p>A teachers aide at Holy Redeemer Christian Academy in Milwaukee\'s is accused of sexually assaulting a 16-year-old girl in a locker room and on a bus and of sending lewd images and messages to three other students.</p>
<p>Jason D. Price, 31,  was charged  with two counts of sexual assault and several other felonies involving juveniles while he was employed by the school.</p>
<p>The criminal complaint accuses Price of forcing the 16-year-old student into a locker room at a basketball game and having sexual intercourse with her.</p>
<p>In a second assault, on March 22, Price is accused of rubbing the girl\'s breasts and thighs for about 15 minutes while he sat with the girl on a bus returning home from a field trip. </p>
<p>Where were the other kids I wonder </p>
<p>Three other victims, all teens, are cited in the complaint as telling authorities Price sent them sexually explicit images and inappropriate messages through Facebook. One also said Price showed her a cellphone video of a sex act.</p>
<p>Price is charged with seven felonies — two counts of sexual assault by school staff, three counts of exposing a child to harmful material, and individual counts of child enticement and causing a child to view a sex act.  
</p>
<p>Holy Redeemer Christian Academy serves students from 4-year-old kindergarten to 12th grade.</p>
<p>According to the complaint, Holy Redeemer\'s Bishop Sedgwick Daniels said Price was hired in September for the academic year to help in the lunchroom, provide assistance to teachers and assist with athletic programs.</p>
<p>On Sunday, after getting calls from several media outlets, Daniels\' staff invited reporters to Holy Redeemer Institutional Church of God in Christ, the church where he is pastor and which shares a sprawling campus with the school.</p>
<p>Daniels did not meet personally with reporters and instead, spoke from the pulpit to hundreds of members of the congregation about the case.
Daniels did not specifically address the assault charges but acknowledged receiving reports that inappropriate text messaging with an employee of the school had taken place.</p>
<p>Daniels told church members he was notified of the inappropriate messages in the afternoon of April 11 and said the employee was dismissed 10 minutes later. Although the employee apparently had already resigned, Daniels said, he told the congregation the man was taken away by authorities.</p>
<p>&quot;We had nothing to do with that,&quot; he said, referring to the messaging.
Parents and students were contacted about the incident, he told the congregation, adding that all job candidates are screened before they are hired.</p>
<p>&quot;When anything goes good at Holy Redeemer, I want God to get the glory and you to get the credit,&quot; he said. &quot;But when there are challenges that we face, I want God to get the praise and I\'ll take the blame.&quot;
Afterward, through a member of the church staff, Daniels declined to talk further about the case with reporters.</p>
<p>I was not impressed with the Bishops interview .  It
Just reeked of “ my hands are clean”.</p>
<p>No empathy, no anger .  I just didn’t like his flavor.</p>
<p>Another Christian wisconsin school where the children were victimized .   Will they ever be safe ???</p>

            , this statement appears to be inaccurate. The school has no links to the Catholic Church. The website you linked shows it being affiliated with a Protestant church. Please edit within the next 24 hours. Thanks.

            No they will never be safe when the men in charge of Our Children are ruled by a pedophile. How can he not be when he allows the rapes and abuse that have been going on for centuries. He has done nothing to stop them. Even his Bishops are saying he has other things to worry about. Like the climate. He has no concern for Our Children
