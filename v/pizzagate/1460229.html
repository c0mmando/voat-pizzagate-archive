            Maybe this is why FBIanon told us to focus on the Clinton Foundation and associated money trail, not just the pizza place. If the central story is a hoax/PSYOP, it still doesn't mean the central allegations are false.
           </p>
           <p>
            Remember our search of Instagram revealed members of the Anglo-Irish aristocracy (women under 30) commenting on chicken farming. That includes individuals with direct connections to Epstein, Bill Clinton and Tavistock.
           </p>
           <p>
            It could be a strange ritualistic way for these elites to introduce themselves to the semi-aware public, with a sick story, then with a declaration that we can't do anything about it, by bringing the ban hammer down on 'fake news.''
           </p>
           <p>
            The reason Facebook/Twitter/Reddit brought down the ban-hammer, was to prevent normies from making the solid connections that are hidden further down the line, not necessarily the pizza story.
           </p>
           <p>
            Finally, we know the story about certain multinationals using baby fetus material in food and drink products is already OUT IN THE OPEN. I think FBIanon was implying a connection between CF/Soros/Tavistock and what these politicians, bureaucrats and corporate industry leaders have been doing. A repulsive thought, but I'm sure this is the key for us. We need to continue building a working model for the human experimentation/organs trafficking/human waste in food angle.
           </p>
           <p>
            P.S. This is just a thought experiment. I think it's important nevertheless to research the DC underground/basement concerns further, to see what we come up with from that perspective.

            Why would you implicate yourself in a crime in order to cover up that crime, hell even with the evidence we have at the moment its enough to build a negative spin on washington DC and keeps the idea in mind for people to look at whats happening.
           </p>
           <p>
            What food would it be to discredit a bunch of anonymous assholes on the Internet when a) it hasnt worked previously b) better to not bring up the crimes that up until now had been safely buried c) risk blowing the entire operation wide open and spilling all the evidence into tbe mainstream
           </p>
           <p>
            Sure we are seeing cover up but damn are they sloppy.
They have been doing it too long, involved too many people, they have left too many tracks on the Internet with too many peoples eyes on it. They'll never even find all the evidence to destroy.

              But no, we caught them with their pants down, James Alefantis isnt the only suspect being dug on. This isnt going away. Even of he is locked up, and in fact of he is thrown under the bus it will only fuel more investigations, more mainstream coverage and attention.

            Even though the two questions are intentionally (and sequencially) leading, I'll answer.  JA visited the WH for as many as 4 different reasons, presuming that the back to back days with identical guest count and time frame are the same visit.  Since we are inviting conjecture, let's put it out there that these visits would be entirely unnecessary to begin such an Op.
Additionally, the assumption in the second question is at least partially opposing the less than optimal time line and paper trail of the dissemination of information.  How did wiki leaks come by these emails?  Why release them when they did?  What (other than not electing HRC) has this info helped accomplish?  As trails now dissappear while profiles and images get secured or deleted, was cover blown too early?

              I'll have to do the research later today, in 8hrs or so, but at first glance:  the double day looks like it may have been at his own (or a friend's/companion's) request --- he knows a lot of DC elites; the first and fourth entries seem to be big parties, the initial one right around the time of a BHO thank you party for mid-term Dem supporters, then the other in the time frame for his own re-election supporters.  The visit in 2014 as part of a group of 19, I don't know.  But as I said, these visits would be totally unnecessary for a PsyOp, and even counterintuitive when they are so obviously logged.

            Saying pizzagate is a psyop, is actually a good example of a psyop that would be used to undermine pizzagate, similar to the mainstream media psyop claiming pizzagate is debunked.

             Judging by the fact that WL is compromised, I think the most likely explanation is that these motherfuckers think they can isolate this to John Podesta. I think they are fucking him over for losing the election for Hillary. If they let this go out, they will try so fucking hard to keep it just about Podesta.

             So all the information that I posted about Alefantis, what do you think about that?  I haven't seen any posts/articles about his background.  Is that not important to look at ?

            I think you're jumping to false conclusions that are just not supported by any of your reasoning. It makes me wonder what your motivations are.

              Actually there is a discrepancy between what you said you are doing and what you actually did. You start out by saying this is a game, but then you devote the entire post to discrediting the entire pizzagate scandal. Then, at the end of it you ask "was that the start of operation pizzagate?" In the courts, they call that a leading question. You are speaking as though operation pizzagate is a foregone conclusion. Like your theory is fact. This isn't a game. This is just you discrediting pizzagate.

               Why would you start a psyop to discredit a bunch of unknown people that only came to the party because of the "psyop", like thats like kicking a wasp nest in order to .. what exactly? Piss off the wasps to say "see the wasps are dangerous??"

               I haven't tried to discredit pizzagate at all.  I'm trying to understand what is going on and to emphasize that it is important to try to distinguish real information from disinformation. *
              </p>
              <p>
               My post focused on looking at the possibility of this Pizzagate being loaded with red herrings.  As critical thinkers one must be open to that idea otherwise you are open to manipulation.  This thread is already loaded with much intensive and excellent sleuthing, digging up information that needs police investigation.  But there are also dead ends and people moving in circles, meanwhile the MSM are campaigning against us.  We have to think about progress and how to avoid being shut down and overrun by trolls.  Because that is where we are headed if we do not look to past cases where that scenario happened.*
              </p>
              <p>
               Disinformation plays on confirmation bia and the emotional/psychological aspects of dealing with stories that deal with child rape.  For some people who are new to this, the imagery and videos that are a component of this scandal, will be the complete focus.  Hence the continual reposting of the Ape videos for example.*
              </p>

               Game theory is used in war.  Look it up.  And there is no doubt that we are at war.
