            This explanation make much more sense than the drugs that many are suggesting.  Would you mind posting your info in the other thread that seems to have more traction and will hopefully get more exposure!  Thank you for sharing this!!

            This makes a lot of sense.  I am still appalled that he can send out such an email unchecked.  I guess his day job is just a cover and it doesn't matter if he looks a fool with a beanie baby collection to those who don't know what he's selling.  I'm out of up votes, but this is informative. Thanks.
