            GOP lobbyist Burkman statement on Detective Wheeler's finding that Seth Rich possibly sent emails to Wikileaks
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             “A part of a thorough, private and intensive investigation, our team of independent forensic experts at The Profiling Project has been looking into Russia’s connection to the murder of Seth Rich. So far, they have not been able to rule it out.
            </p>
            <p>
             “Regarding today’s report about a private investigator, emails and WikiLeaks: We have no connection to the private investigator and the information he is alleging. If such 40,000 emails between Seth Rich and WikiLeaks exist, I’m calling on the private investigator to release them so our team can independently verify the emails and determine how and if they connect Russia and WikiLeaks to Seth’s murder.

            Jack Burkman has also paid for billboards and bus bench ads offering a $105,000 reward for information in the Seth Rich case, and in one case Rich's parents joined his efforts to turn up information:
           </p>
           <p>
            "n November, Joel Rich and his wife Mary joined Mr. Burkman to flyer the neighborhood where Mr. Rich was gunned down."

            I will give this Burkman kudos for coming up with an original approach. I think it's well designed, because the fact they are students at a school, and there are numbers of them, and it is all being publicized, gives them a measure of security that the lone wolf citizen investigator does not have. The criminals who are responsible for the murder are also responsible for keeping the lid on. I believe the WDC police are compromised, both in general and in particular on this case, under instructions to stand down. Jerome Corsi &amp; Kim Dotcom both have scheduled revelations for next week so let's see how the new information changes the picture.

            Was going to just give this an upvoat, but this:
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             All the while, making sure they respect the wishes of his family.
            </p>
           </blockquote>
           <p>
            Why? Why are duty-bound to respect the wishes of the family and WTH does this even mean? If they discover Seth Rich was the leaker, then they keep it quiet? Reject it? Lie about it so as not to hurt the feelings of his family? Does everything have to pass their inspection and meet with their approval?
           </p>
           <p>
            Remember, this is the family that never even called for an independent autopsy? And lauded the DC police? This family is part of the problem.
           </p>
           <p>
            And this case ... you know ... I'm remembering something in another thread I posted. I ran across something that had nothing to do with anything ... it just was there ... but it really does seem to connect to this case. I'll have to see if I can retrace my steps and find it again ... probably not. Crap!

             Well, I am a little worried, because they said they want to see the private and personal side which means in my thinking they want to see if there is any truth to the talk about the Panda pedo talk and because he comes from Omaha.  That is my understanding.  So they are saying if they find anything like that or similar they will maybe do it in a respectful way.  What worries me about this whole thing, I don't know if I trust this guy Jack.  How do we know he is not waiting to jump at finding something sinister and blow it out of proportion.  I am worried only because we have had so many people try to railroad this investigation, that''s all I am saying.  Why are they even looking into something like that, if something turns up, I will be shocked.  Mortally shocked. Believe me if they find one little thing like he went to a gay bar (even just o hang out with a gay friend)  this investigation will turn into a Circus.

              Being a pedo .... or being gay .... light years apart! One's illegal ... one's not. And I'm really tired of rumors and innuendo. People like pandas without them being in league with JA and his Panda Cult. In fact, I never heard what you just said, so how widespread could it be?

              Basically, he died because he was the DNC leaker. End of story. So who decided to stop him? That's what they have to do. I don't care what his family thinks ... I don't A lot of families have to exposed to horrific secrets. I'm sorry, but that's the way it is. This family has done nothing but interfere. I still haven't seen a response from them re: KimDotCom's letter to them.

              Anyway, hope someone gets to the bottom of this.

               I know they are light years apart but others would be happy to find a smidgen on either one or make something out of nothing, that is all I am saying.  The case needs to be looked at as a murder and we need to find the attackers and who we think instigated the whole thing in the first place. It sounds like they are looking in to him personally, we need to do that to the killers.  Seth did not commit a crime.

                Understood. But that's what this group is doing. I just want to know who killed him. If it turns out, Seth wasn't an angel, none of us are. And if they uncover secrets that have nothing to do with this, then I have no desire to know about them. They'd have a better handle on finding the killers. They can read the medical charts, police reports, monitor readings, etc. It's just ridiculous that an attending physician or nursing staff couldn't see a drop-off in readings and take action. Was there no signal? Was there no checking? Then there's his laptop. We don't know the chain of custody. The DNC could have loaded/unloaded tons of crap on there to make him look like a pedo. Who else would have such a stash? It'd be like borrowing a cigarette amongst that crowd. The smoking gun to me is Pedosta's email talking about making an example of the leaker. Follow Ye Breadcrumbs.

                 Yes I agree that it is important to follow Podesta's Breadcrumbs.  But I hope they can see the forest through the trees.  I wonder why they will have the permission to have all of the documents and we could even not find out what hospital.  It seems that money talks.

                  Well, really, we don't know that anybody's tried. I'm not talking about indie journalists, but did the parents ask for the records? Did their attorney ask for them? If they were going to sue the hospital for wrongful death/malpractice, they definitely would have them in their hot little hands.

                   You would think in the normal sequence of things that is what they would have done.  But I truly believe their hands are tied or they have been denied or they are bogus.  Maybe with information missing.  Remember the police report, someone said it was incomplete.  This whole rabbit hole has been devoid of proper information.   I truly also believe they are scared they may lose their other son.

                    No way. They're two liberal Kool-aid drinking Cannibal Queen enthusiasts. All they've done is hamper the investigation. I don't know any parents that would behave this way. It's disgraceful. They were the first ones saying that it was impossible for Seth to have been critical of Killary.

             Well, that's all right. I think that the case is of larger importance than the wishes of the family, which might be different from what they've publicly said. I posted this article just because it's information about the Seth Rich murder investigation and something to keep an eye on and see if anything develops out of it.  I took just excerpts but the whole article is worth reading. Here's another comment made by one of the student investigators regarding Rich's family:
            </p>
            <blockquote>
             <p>
              "It's very important to remember as an outcome of this whole situation. We want to kind of keep his family in mind and give his family some closure," Volunteer Sarah Tahmourpour said.
             </p>

              The comment about upvoating wasn't directed at you, at this team for issuing the statement.

              It's really important that we get all the news, so you did the right thing. Sorry, if I came off abrasive or upset with you. It was "THIS BEING SENSITIVE TO THE FAMILY" thing. We'll see ... I have my fingers crossed.

               No problem. I understand and agree. It simply smells very fishy that the family doesn't want the possibility that he was the leaker and murdered for it investigated, and that the MSM treats the possibility as ridiculous. The MSM seems to be operating on the assumption that Democrats are above corruption. Of course, Trump and Republicans aren't.

             I hope  not, but it could be a possibility.  We have a better sense of the whole picture, and what else is behind all of this.  They will look at differently than we have.

               Wish there was a way.  They have ways right now to know who we are.  But they can't kill all of us at the same time, I hope.  The only they can stop this train now is to take down the internet.  That would create Mob Mayhem.

            No, no. George Washington University is a different institution from Georgetown University. I' m wondering if these students are being given access to material the public cant see, like a coroners report.  Perhaps not since they sem to be profiling the victim from a psych/social perspective.

            Yes, as I've been saying all along.  First, it must be established that SR was a real live breathing human who actually lived and is actually dead.  At this point, "Seth Rich" is a persona comprised of digital images.  This reeks of Sandy Hook fakery.

            So they gave up the evidence. And are only profiling on the victim.  Where's the bit that looks into finding the assassins?  Lots to learn. Been at it for a couple of months. Must have got bogged down in the coverup.

             A "hit" like this is useless to profilers because the assassin has no connection to the victim, and shot him from a distance. It was impersonal as fuck. There's no "personality" or "signature" involved in the crime.
            </p>
            <p>
             Somebody else wanted Rich dead, and brought in a third party to do it. By examining Rich himself they can discern the person or persons connected to him most likely to want him dead given his behavior and actions leading up to his death. Which will point them at the DNC, and specifically John Podesta, given his "Make an example" email. Likely they'll examine the likelihood of it being a random shooting too, and match the nature, and time and place of the murder to other shootings to see if it shares any real similarities below the surface level.

            Is this the possible Seth Rich camera you were mentioning the other day?

             Yes, that is the market with the camera, but mine was much closer.  The point is that at the time of the crime, I suspected that maybe the camera was lowered by the attackers, so that it only recorded their feet.  That is what they say was on a camera. You know, like we suspected they did at CPP outside to the cameras right after the guy stormed the shop.

            "What we found is there actually is possibly another surveillance camera that may have been missed in the initial investigation so we have turned that over to the police," Zhang said.
Hopefully they made a copy of the video data before turning it over to police where it will be "lost" like his laptop.

             From the sound of it, it doesn't seem like they're saying that they had the video themselves, but found out there was another camera nearby that might have captured the crime and turned over that piece of information to police because it may have been overlooked.
