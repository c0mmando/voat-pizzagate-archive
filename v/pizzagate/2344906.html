<p>Relevance: Pamela Anderson became relevant to pizzagate when she tried to cozy up with Julian Assange who is Mr. Pizzagate. Her visits to the embassy had some of us gnashing our teeth and wondering if JA were out of his mind for seeing her. There was even a blackout at the embassy after one of her visits that had everyone wondering if he\'d been kidnapped or even alive. She\'s hosting one of his conferences, and continues to be promoted on JA\'s/and Wikileaks\' accounts hawking her underwear. </p>

<p>Call me stupid (you\'re, &quot;stupid&quot;), call me insane (you\'re, &quot;insane\'), while I knew about Ms. Anderson\'s close relationship with Assange, I never knew about the other one ... the one that explains so much. I ran into an article about it. I wasn\'t even searching for it, it just appeared ... and it explains soooooo much. </p>
<p>I was one of those suspicious about Ms. Anderson\'s intentions in befriending Mr. Assange. That chick had me screaming at my computer screen when I learned about the visits she was making. I was screaming even louder when I learned she was bringing him food. Seems I\'m not the only one: </p>

<p>Julian Assange is at the centre of some online conspiracy theories, all because of Pamela Anderson and a vegan meal. Yup, you read it right. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>There was plenty of speculation of her being a honeypot and mind-controlled sex kitten, and it seems all the conspiracy theories were right. Not often we get things all right, but we did with her. For me, the revelation came from the article, the one that revealed what close friends Ms. Anderson was with ... Hugh Hefner? </p>
<p>Yes, the disgusting POS that published nude pics of an underage Brooke Shields was the favorite man in her life. She even wrote a tribute to the debauched SOB when he died. Here it is in its entirety. Like I said, it explains it all. And because we\'re all friends, you just want to keep the barf bag handy: </p>

<p>Goodbye #Hef Mr Hefner I have so many thoughts, I have no brain n right now to edit I am me because of you You taught me everything important about freedom and respect. Outside of my family You were the most important person in my life. You gave me my life... People tell me all the time That I was your favorite... I\'m in such deep shock. But you were old, your back hurt you so much. Last time I saw you You were using a walker. You didn\'t want me to see. You couldn\'t hear. You had a piece of paper in your pocket you showed me - with my name Pamela with a heart around it. Now, I\'m falling apart. This feeling is so crazy. It\'s raining in Paris now. I\'m by the window. Everything anyone loves about me is because you understood me. Accepted me and encouraged me to be myself. Love like no one else. Live recklessly With unfiltered abandon. You said the magazine was about a girl like me. That I embody the spirit you fantasized about. I was the one. You said. I can hear you say - Be brave. There are no rules. Live your life I\'m proud of you. There are no mistakes. And with men - Enjoy ... (Your wonderful laugh) You have the world by the tail You are a good girl And you are so loved - You are not crazy. You are wild and free Stay strong, Stay vulnerable. ... &quot;It\'s movie time&quot; You loved my boys ... You were always, always there for us. With your love Your crazy wisdom. I will miss your everything. Thank you for making the world a better place. A freeer and sexier place. You were a gentleman charming, elegant, chivalrous And so much fun. Goodbye Hef ... Your Pamela 💋 </p>

<p>Really? </p>
<h1>Your Pamela 💋</h1>
<p>Ugh! And about those bunny ears Hef used, they look an awful lot like the two fingered symbol that Illuminatis display. This one: </p>

<p>Yup, the sign is being given by none other than the shill/handler/betrayer Feldman. Came across an article on him, too. Will post it later. Gives new insight into what went on between him and Haim.</p>',

            On a bit of a tangent.. I cant help but notice how similar Feldman looks to Charlie Sheen in that pic.. I mean he has the same eyes and smile. That creeps me out a bit.. I wonder if he could actually be his real father? Anything's possible in Pedowood.

            Pamela Anderson an MK Ultra-victim?
           </p>
           <p>
            Well, I am still struggeling with the memories of MK Ultra-victims like Brice Taylor or Cathy O'Brien. Just so hard to believe.... would really love to get to the places mentioned with some special forces a and have a look...
           </p>
           <p>
            well, back to Pamela!
           </p>
           <p>
            Just found this article about Pamela Anderson, that she has been abused and raped as a little girl and teenager.

             Yes, it's why I didn't know what to think about her. She had a rough time with a fellow actor taking advantage, too.
            </p>
            <p>
             The more I read and think about her, she's really almost a clone of Marilyn Monroe. They're both hypersexual, but are very smart. And MM had a similar abusive childhood.
            </p>
            <p>
             Hefner had to have been her handler. Now that he's gone, I wonder who's taken her place?

                           It happens. If I feel a point needs to  be made, I'll post it even if unpopular. Someone redpilled me as concerns Feldman. I was a big supporter because I fell for the act. But when I saw those tweets calling pizzagate a devious lie and the YouTube video on Corey's Angels, there was no turning back. I got what a fraud he was and now I'm trying to return the favor.
