            That. And perhaps author Adrian Higgins sucks at writing. But really, who cares? No intelligent person would pay for a copy of Washington Post; it's pure smut; it's the fast food of literature, not suitable for compost. In an earlier thread, there was speculation of human remains in our food supply. So perhaps it would be better to make the best use out of Mr. Higgins's crap article, and look into gardening.

            The word occult does in fact mean hidden, to obscure or be obscured.. the moon occults the sun during an eclipse for example. That is not a new definition. The reason the occult is even called the occult is because it is traditionally hidden or not publicly shared. But many things are called occult or occulted and the word is not inherently negative. From Miriam-Webster dictionary:
           </p>
           <pre><code>1:  not revealed :  secret
"deep subterranean occult jealousy" — J. C. Powys
2:  not easily apprehended or understood :  abstruse, mysterious
"occult matters like nuclear physics, radiation effects and the designing of rockets" — Robert Bendiner
3:  hidden from view :  concealed occult underground passages
4:  of or relating to the occult
*"… the occult arts—astrology, palmistry, card reading" … — Amy Fine Collins*
occult practices
5:  not manifest or detectable by clinical methods alone occult carcinoma; 
also: not present in macroscopic amounts: occult blood in a stool
</code></pre>
           <p>
            So no, I don' think (in this case) this article has anything at all to do with the occult as it relates to pizzagate or is any indicator of anyone being outed. Sorry to say.
