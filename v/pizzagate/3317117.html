<p>I\'m just here to elaborate.</p>
<p>Going back in time...
In May of 2015, Kamala Harris was Attorney General of California.  At that time, Brandon Kiel, a member of Harris\' staff, was among the trio locked up under suspicion of impersonating cops.  The other arrestees were Tonette Hayes and &quot;Chief&quot; David Henry.  All three were released later that day.</p>
<p>This trio were members of the Masonic Fraternal Police Department.  The group\'s website claims that it was created by the Knights Templar in 1100 BC, and that they are &quot;the oldest and most respected organization in the \'World.\'&quot;  It also says the group has jurisdiction over 33 states and Mexico.  Accounts that appear to be linked to Henry on Google and YouTube refer to him as &quot;Illuminati Grandmaster X,&quot; a mystical eccentric who posed for photos looking like an ancient Tower of London guard.  
</p>
<p><a href="https://masonicfraternalpolicedepartment.org/">https://masonicfraternalpolicedepartment.org/</a></p>
<p>This group was alleged to have broken the law by mailing letters to police chiefs all over Southern California declaring Henry their Chief.  Afterward, Kiel (Kamala Harris\' employee), called around and tried to schedule meetings with law enforcement officials.  That triggered an investigation into whether their activities constituted an impersonation of police officers.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.vice.com/da/article/7bdpee/la-cops-cracked-down-on-a-bizarre-illuminati-loving-club-of-alleged-police-impersonators-506">https://www.vice.com/da/article/7bdpee/la-cops-cracked-down-on-a-bizarre-illuminati-loving-club-of-alleged-police-impersonators-506</a></p>
<p>Brandon Kiel was Deputy Director of Community Affairs at the California DOJ.  During the investigation of two sites in Santa Clarita, officers found badges, weapons, uniforms, and law enforcement paraphernalia.</p>
<p>Kamala Harris, at the time of this incident, was the  Democratic front-runner to replace Barbara Boxer (D-California) in 2016.  Her office declined to comment to the Times but said Kiel had been placed on administrative leave.</p>

<p>Now, flash forward to April 2016...
The case against Henry, Kiel, and Hayes collapsed. LA County Superior Court  Judge Hayden Zacky granted  a motion to dismiss the  charges against Kiel, and &quot;Illuminati Grandmaster David Inkk Henry, suddenly died at age 47 of a pulmonary embolism at Henry Mayo Newhall Memorial Hospital.  Henry\'s attorney, Gary Casselman, wondered why the charges had been brought to begin with.</p>

<p>Tonette Hayes was the wife of &quot;Illuminati Grandmaster Henry X,&quot; and Brandon Kiel was married to Hayes\' daughter.</p>

<p>David Beltran, a spokesman for the state DOJ, said Kiel was placed on paid leave April 30, 2015 - the date he was arrested.  His salary was $67,416 annually.  Beltran stated Kamala Harris was &quot;concerned about these serious allegations&quot;...and that her office was cooperating with investigators.  Friends of Kiel rushed to his defense. </p>
<p>Henry was charged with multiple misdemeanors and three counts of felony perjury.  His arraignment was on May 21, 2015.  Kiel was charged with six counts of impersonating a police officer and unlawful use of a state ID.  Hayes was charged with 4 counts of impersonating an officer.  Both Kiel and Hayes were bailed out of jail.</p>
<p>These 3 were also members of a religious philanthropy group that did work in South LA.  They were in contact with various politicians and community leaders.  A spokesman for Rep. Maxine Waters (D-Lis Angeles) confirmed that the group gave her an award in 2012.</p>
<p>The exact structure of their &quot;police department&quot; is unclear.</p>

<p>This wasn\'t the first time an aide to Kamala Harris was charged with impersonating a member of law enforcement.  About a year before Kiel\'s arrest, Adrienne Mayr was arrested for repeatedly flashing the badge of a dead attorney general at drivers in Los Angeles County.  Mayr was a secretary with the DOJ.  She was charged with unlawful use of a badge and impersonating a public officer.

<p>It is unclear if the Masonic Fraternal Police Department is still active.  Their website is still up.</p>',
