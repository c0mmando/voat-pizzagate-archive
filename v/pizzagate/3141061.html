She said he has abilities and access to able to alter medical records and has changed the daughter\'s record to show he is her father.

I believe both women on that stage were there to distract from the child trafficking aspect of NXIVM. Raniere\'s so-called ex-girlfriend played the part of enabler saying we should have sympathy for the women who got involved because many came from dysfunctional backgrounds while Catherine Oxenberg focused on her adult daughter who is involved with the cult and who she says was \'brainwashed\'.  She was there to sell her book.  The genuine ones were the mother and daughter who approached the lawyers and press after the talk to try and highlight the case of the young girl who has allegedly been taken.  I don\'t trust Oxenberg...</p>

            If so, the guy she was involved with and she says took her child could be Thomas E. Arelt:

            In 2015, the year she says her child was taken, she lived at 47 Woodhull Rd, Huntington, NY, which is listed as his current address.  Hard to know how accurate the TruePeopleSearch data is.  Interestingly, her current address is listed as next door at 47 Woodhull Rd.  Also, both have lived at 43 Woodhull, a house located behind 47 Woodhull:

in school, I spend much of my free time volunteering with the

with numerous agencies throughout Dutchess County including
the homeless shelter and Good Counsel (a home for teens and their

                Sidenote: I subsequently realized that 47 HOLLYCROFT AVENUE MANAGEMENT LTD is the management company for the address in Hampstead where Ricky Dearman lived with Ella and the children.  The directors of the company are people who own/live at  the apartments at 47 Hollycroft Avenue in Hampstead so the names change as people move in and out.  Looking at the historical records of the various owners of the apartments in the building I found there are many links with the Tavistock Clinic.

              Several years ago I performed data recovery for a US based satellite TV company owned by a middle eastern man (clearly an arabic name and accent). This recovery was on an 8TB RAID array. Most cases someone removed a wrong disk or did something to crash the array and it just needs to be reassembled, mounted and fsck it. So the first part of recovery is examining the system logs for different things like disk/power/filesystem events. Well this system had a slew of file system errors all which showed there were video files with names that all had ages in them like "8 yo" all the way to "16 yo" and some with pornographic titles. I was able to recover the RAID part with the data on it and I checked the folder these files were in and there were
              <strong>
               thousands of these videos
              </strong>
              . I checked the folder size and it was obviously the purpose of this storage device since it over 80% of the storage space being used.

              I was told I would likely find CP after enough time doing DR, so I documented what I did, per our SOP, reported it to my director and he reported it to the FBI.
             </p>
             <p>
              I had this feeling at the time that the whole satellite thing was being used as a front to distribute CP but I just told myself it was being handed off to better people and that was all I could do to help. I'm dumbfounded the guy just acted so casual about it and didn't think anyone would notice what the dataset consisted of. I don't poke around in people's data, but couldn't justify to not do anything in this case.

              I'm still in shock at the emergence of the "streaming" industry. Look at twitch, all it does is host people streaming games and it sold for a billion dollars. The hardware and internet bandwidth needed to host streaming services is readily available to the public, anyone can go rent a server these days, and you can even purchase "anonymous hosting" with bitcoin through TOR. Hell you can even rent a server hosted in a raid proof bomb bunker. For the handling of the video, there is open source software for encoding/streaming/encryption. The whole streaming thing seems to of started with "camgirls" and this idea has been around for a while now.

                 It's as clear as day to me what was going on there and I find it very frustrating that more people did not pick up on the tech side of things.  However, I have a number of other posts in the pipeline now due to the connections made here with Microsoft , the UAE and YahLive.

                 It ties in with some people I found living in the apartment next to Ella Draper and the children. Therapists with a dodgy website which smelled like a front for you know what.  Just like Dearman with his websites.  The house is very much connected with Tavistock as are other properties in the area.

                   Tavistock has a very large portfolio of properties in the London area which they rent out to or sell to people who work with them or connected to them in some way.  I've seen records which go back to the second world war.. we may have generations of families very much connected with them.

             There's definitely something odd going on with these people..and I'm referring in particular to the Alret family.  I've found some public records for Thomas Alret and his brother Robert but searching further under Thomas's  public addresses draws blanks.  Anyhoo, what I can telly you so far is that Robert (aka Bob) is employed with IBM and specifically, Globalfoundries and has a wide circle of friends and family employed within that sector ..

               If he wants to hide her, especially now, it is a distinct possibility.  The Alert oddity, do you think he changed his name?  If he can change medical records surely he can do a name change. So he could be the high stakes wheeler and dealer for the elites  when it comes to procuring Children.  This is as sick as it gets.

                The name change affecting all family members (fake or real) would be a challenge, but if he's the well-connected IT wiz he's said to be, I suppose it could be done.  Actually, it really is the kind of in-your-face half-admission they like to play with..."alert-ing" those victims "with eyes to see" in a bull crap supposed karma work-around.

             Just search for "pizza museum" and you will see some fucjed up shit.
            </p>
            <p>
             If you are at all familiar with pizzagate then everything in this "museum" will trigger you with visual cues... way before you even recognize why.

            Thanks for reposting this. I missed it on the first go around. It sounds very similar to what Scientologists were attempting to do back in the 70s with
            <a href="https://throughthelookingglassnews.wordpress.com/2017/12/02/operation-snow-white-how-scientology-was-behind-the-largest-infiltration-of-the-us-government-in-history-besides-israel-with-5000-under-cover-agents/">
             Operation: Snow White
            </a>
            . It's no secret that Raniere based NXIVM on some of Scientology's principles and methodologies. His Executive Success Program was the perfect way to recruit insiders to the cult that could help cover their tracks. Something that has always bugged me was what was in it for the men who joined NXIVM? There was no obvious benefit for a man to join that I could see. Perhaps this was it?

               There was a special NXIVM club for the husbands of the women, unfortunately forgot the name.

              <p>
               They had some 'nice' pamphlets and workshops about how women should be obedient etc. IIRC.

                  here's something interesting....
                 </p>
                 <p>

                  </a>
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  Long-time readers of Frank Report will remember the name Richard Mays. Sr.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  He’s the former member of the Arkansas Supreme Court who was hired to clean up the mess that Keith Raniere left behind in that state when his Consumers’ Buyline business was determined to be an illegal pyramid scheme (Raniere wanted Mays to have the Arkansas Attorney General issue him a letter-of-exoneration regarding the Consumers’ Buyline investigation in that state).
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  He’s also the guy who, along with former Massachusetts Attorney General Scott Hershberger, personally met with Albany County District Attorney David Soares and convinced him to bring bogus criminal charges against former NXIVM consultant Joe O’Hara (Those charges were tossed at the initial hearing on the case).
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  And let’s not forget that Mays, Sr. is also the guy who tried to coerce U.S. Airlines into paying an exorbitant amount to NXIVM President Nancy Salzman after she carelessly left her laptop behind when she disembarked from a flight in Albany, NY.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  He 
addition to serving as an influence peddler for the NXIVM/ESP cult, Richard Mays, Sr. also got his daughter heavily involved in taking courses under the tutelage of Salzman and Raniere.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  He also solicited political donations from Clare Bronfman and Sara Bronfman-Igtet – and other NXIVM members – for his old pals from Little Rock, AR, Hillary Clinton, and Mike Huckabee.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  Mays, Sr. also made several videotapes in which he extolled the wonderfulness of Raniere.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  It is not known if any of those were seized by the F.B.I. when they raided Nancy Salzman’s home in March 2018.

              It's the website McGowans daughters set up as a clearing house for his work. I asked about the the name I too was surprised, but I didn't get a response. I mentioned that before I send a donation I would like some clarification as I am allergic to all things CIA. That being said, it's a repository of his work and you will not be disappointed.

               Dave chose the name to mock the CIA considering they are the biggest purveyors of fake news. I always found McGowans ability to keep his humor even when dealing with such horrific subject matter endearing.

                Haven't a clue. Other than the fact that it's not an advertisement for  plastic gems in the hair. To stupid.

                  Holy shit. I thought Russell was from Germany?  I didn't recall Anthony Sutton mention a euro branch of the S&amp;B? Or is it a different name,  like the Quill and Feather, based at Cornell?
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  Yea I knew that Belgium is the fucking worst country when it comes to this shit.  Perfect too with all the pedovores in the EU. I wonder if Strassburg has a similar level of sex trafficking as Brussels . Strassburg has a lot of EU offices and going ons.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  Now back to the Instagram pic. First time for me on Instagram . Anyway so I click on the Kesha link and it sends me to dozens of photos of girls with gems in their hair. Now maybe it's me not looking at pictures of modern girls and no knowledge of fashion stuff, but the pictures seem to be advertising the girls not the hair designs.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  So I click on the link for this beauty whatever Ap. And the ap has 2 reviews. The second review is from a Richard Dawes, he gave the ap  one star., he's complaining about it not working right, after all the reading through the legal section and filling out all his information...WTF?  Now maybe R. Dawes Is a girl, with a screen name to protect her identity. But does a girl complain like that, does a girl who is superficial to begin with, wanting a beauty ap etc, read through the legal disclaimer? 
As far as a map,do you think it's like the infamous napkin "could be pizza related"  Map. So instead of writing on backs of napkins they write on women's hair? 
Some of the pictures looked downright explicit. Some girls looked sad, most were young very young, some looked beaten down, some looked resigned and others dispassionate and others hyper sexual.
                 </p>
