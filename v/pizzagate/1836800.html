&quot;IMDB review: If you\'ve ever wondered why conspiracy &quot;theories&quot; about Satanists and pedophiles running the Government are believed so widely, this 1994 documentary will help you understand.

<p>The documentary makers have done an excellent job, rather than rely on innuendo and historical allegations, the latter of which are often unreliable or imaginary, they have dug out correspondence between Righton and his fellow pedophile Charles Napier, and even a home video of Napier actually grooming underage boys in Sweden where he had relocated after being banned from teaching here. Last year, Napier was given a 13 year sentence for historical sex offenses against boys, and unlike the convictions of Rolf Harris, Max Clifford and even Gary Glitter, there is no question of this being any kind of miscarriage of justice.</p>
<p>**Napier\'s conviction came twenty years after this documentary was first screened, which begs the question, what where the authorities doing in the meantime? Well, one of those authorities was Righton himself, who actually gave Napier a reference when he had the audacity to reapply for a teaching post in England. **&quot;</p>

            Okay. I just was asking you to take a look at the card (link at the end of the post), and give your impression of what it depicts. This does not require prior knowledge.

             It's not that more pedos live there, it's the conditions that prevail. People are beginning to learn that children in extreme poverty or in war zones are extremely vulnerable to preditors. Look at Haiti, Cambodia, India, Libya, etc. The pedo will get them where they can.
