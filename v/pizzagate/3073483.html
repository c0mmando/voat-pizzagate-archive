<p><a href="http://archive.is/YC9dV">Without further ado, we begin this journey</a>- for no particular reason - with the aforementioned Phil Hartman, who was a high school friend of Lynette &quot;Squeaky&quot; Fromme, who later became a disciple of Charlie Manson, a jailhouse correspondent of John Hinckley, and the attempted assassin of President Gerald Ford, who was once a roommate of modeling entrepreneur Harry Conover, whose wife was the infamous Candy Jones, who was \'treated\' by CIA-linked hypnotist William Jennings Bryan, </p>
<p>who also \'treated\' the purported Boston Strangler, Albert DeSalvo, whose name was written repetitively throughout the diaries of Sirhan Sirhan, who was also \'treated\' by Bryan, who served as the technical director on The Manchurian Candidate, 
which was directed by John Frankenheimer, at whose beach house a dinner was held on June 5, 1968 
whose attendees included &quot;Mama&quot; Cass Elliot, Roman Polanski, and Sharon Tate, who was killed just over a year later by followers of Charlie Manson, whose music was recorded by Doris Day\'s son, music producer Terry Melcher, who lived with girlfriend Candace Bergen at 10050 Cielo Drive the year before it became a slaughterhouse after being rented by Polanski..</p>
<p>..who initially was slated to pen the screenplay for Day of the Dolphin, which purported to tell the story of Dr. John Lilly, who was a friend of Timothy Leary, whose Mellon family-owned Millbrook estate was frequently visited by Dr. Max &quot;Feelgood&quot; Jacobson, who once \'treated\' Judy Garland and who served as the personal physician of John Kennedy, whose assassination prompted the shelving of the film The Manchurian Candidate by its star, Frank Sinatra, who was a frequent companion of fellow \'Brat Packer\' Sammy Davis, Jr.,</p>
<p>..who was an acknowledged member of Anton LaVey\'s Church of Satan, from where Manson recruited killers Bobby &quot;Cupid&quot; Beausoleil and Susan &quot;Sexy Sadie&quot; Atkins, who confessed to her cellmates that she had stabbed to death actress Sharon Tate, who was inducted into witchcraft on the set of the Polanski-directed film The Fearless Vampire Killers by Alexander &quot;King of the Witches&quot; Saunders, who received \'training\' as a child from Aleister Crowley,</p>
<p>..whose followers included Anton LaVey and fellow Church of Satan member Kenneth Anger, who was the roommate (and probable lover) of Family member Bobby Beausoleil, who once appeared in an underground film titled Mondo Hollywood, which also featured hairdresser and Manson victim Jay Sebring, who was a former lover of Sharon Tate, who was a friend of a wealthy widow named Charlene Caffritz, who played host to - and filmed the exploits of - Charlie and some of his girls, who also lived for a time with Beach Boy Dennis Wilson, </p>
</blockquote>
<p>..who recorded a song penned by Charlie, who was an occasional member of the entourage of Mama Cass, who was listed as a defense witness for Charlie\'s trial (but never called), as was her Mamas and the Papas band-mate John Phillips, who was close to Polanski, Tate, Melcher, Mick Jagger, Keith Richards, Cass Elliot, and film producer Robert Evans, </p>
<blockquote>
<p>..who was working with - and very likely contracted the execution killing of - Roy Radin, whose assistant was Michael DeVinko aka Mickie DeVinko aka Mickie Deans, who married - just a few months before her untimely death - Wizard of Oz star Judy Garland, who as a teen was flooded with phone messages and telegrams by admirer Oscar Levant, whose dead body was found by Candace Bergen, who - as a photojournalist for Life magazine - covered the preempted presidential campaign of Robert Kennedy..</p>
<p>who was romantically linked to Marilyn Monroe, who was also linked to Anton LaVey, who appeared in Kenneth Anger\'s Invocation of My Demon Brother (released in August of 1969) along with Bobby Beausoleil, Mick Jagger and Keith Richards, 
who was a guest at the 1968 London wedding of Sharon Tate to Roman Polanski, who - during a nude photo shoot - molested a thirteen-year-old girl at the home of Jack Nicholson, who was a friend of Cass Elliot, as were Robert Evans and Manson victims Jay Sebring, Voytek Frykowski and Abigail Folger, who provided funding for the Himalayan Academy, </p>
<blockquote>
<p>which Kenneth Anger helped form with Timothy Leary, who was at the side of the stage at the 1969 Altamont concert where - while the Rolling Stones played the Process Church-inspired Sympathy for the Devil* - a fan was killed on film by the Hell\'s Angels, who had been romanticized and transformed into anti-establishment heroes in the film Scorpio Rising by Kenneth Anger and the book Hell\'s Angels by Hunter S. Thompson, </p>
<p>both of whom have been accused of making snuff films** for private collectors, which was also a favorite pastime of Charlie Manson, one of whose underage recruits was Didi Lansbury, who had written permission to travel with Charlie from her mother, Angela Lansbury, who starred as the control agent in The Manchurian Candidate, which was based on the novel of the same name by Richard Condon, </p>
</blockquote>
<p>who once served as a publicist for Walt Disney, who once owned the home where the Manson Family slaughtered Leno LaBianca and wife Rosemary, who was involved in the trafficking of drugs, as were many of those in this twisted saga, including Charles Manson, victims Voytek Frykowski and Abigail Folger, John Phillips and Kenneth Anger, who was a huge fan of the dark and violent imagery of the Rosicrucian-inspired, L. Frank Baum-penned Oz books, 
which inspired the band The Magick Powerhouse of Oz, which was led by Bobby Beausoleil,</p>
<p>who was also at one time in the band Love with Arthur Lee, four of whose members later turned up dead or missing and presumed dead, </p>
<ul>

Cass Elliot (who allegedly choked on a sandwich in 1974), </li>
<li>
Dennis Wilson (who allegedly drowned on December 28, 1983), and </li>

Gram Parsons, whose corpse was stolen and burned at Joshua Tree on the autumnal equinox of 1973 by his band\'s road manager, Phil Kaufman, </li>

<p>who was a good friend from prison of Charlie Manson, who met (at Cass Elliot\'s house) and received money from victim Abigail Folger, who also funded Kenneth Anger, who at various times lived with both Jimmy Page (who purchased Crowley\'s home and many of his artifacts) and Keith Richards &amp; Anita Pallenberg, whose home - in 1979 - yielded the body of a teenager who had been shot to death, </p>
<blockquote>
<p>as was John Lennon the next year by Mark David Chapman, who shortly before doing so met with - and offered a gift of live bullets to - Kenneth Anger, whose films were cited as a major influence by photographer Robert Mapplethorpe, who was implicated by witnesses in the Halloween 1981 execution killing of New York photographer Ronald Sisman (a close associate of Roy Radin), </p>
<blockquote>
<p>who was reportedly in possession of a snuff film of one of the Son of Sam murders, which were allegedly committed by David Berkowitz, who from prison accurately described the Sisman killing before it happened and who took the fall for the Son of Sam murders to cover up the involvement of others, including possibly Roy Radin and wealthy art dealer Andrew Crispo, who admitted being present at the site of a ritual murder which was committed by a man named Bernard LeGeros, who was the son of a State Department official, </p>
</blockquote>
<p>as was Pic Dawson, who was a regular member of the entourage of Cass Elliot, as was a one-time bodyguard of publisher Larry Flynt named Bill Mentzer, who was convicted of killing Radin and who was suspected of involvement in numerous other contract murders, including some of those attributed to David Berkowitz, </p>
<p>who was \'examined\' by psychiatrist/hypnotist Daniel Schwartz, as was Mark David Chapman, who was obsessed with the film The Wizard of Oz and the book The Catcher in the Rye, which was written by reclusive author J.D. Salinger, who served in the OSS with Henry Kissinger, who was a close adviser to Gerald Ford, who once met and shook hands with Mark David Chapman, who was \'examined\' by psychiatrist/hypnotist Bernard Diamond, </p>
<p>who also \'examined\' Sirhan Sirhan, who had connections to the Process Church, </p>
<blockquote>
<p>as did many of those ensnared in this sordid web, including Kenneth Anger, John Phillips, Roy Radin, David Berkowitz and Charlie Manson, who attended a New Year\'s Eve party at the home of John Phillips, who wrote the siren song of the \'Summer of Love,\' bringing thousands of hippies and flower children streaming into San Francisco and into the hands of such figures as Louis &quot;Dr. Jolly&quot; West, Anton LaVey, Charlie Manson, Bobby Beausoleil, Timothy Leary and Kenneth Anger, who - just three days after the suspicious death of Rolling Stone Brian Jones - filmed the Hell\'s Angels stomping the crowd at a 1969 Stones concert in London, just five months before they did the very same thing to the crowd at Altamont, which was organized by San Francisco attorney Melvin Belli,</p>
</blockquote>
<p>who consulted with F. Lee Bailey whilst the latter was busily railroading Albert DeSalvo and later consulted with Richard &quot;The Night Stalker&quot; Ramirez, who was offered an honorary membership in the Church of Satan by Anton LaVey\'s daughter Zeena, 
who along with boyfriend Nickolas Schreck staged an event on 8-8-88 celebrating the slaughter of the victims of the Manson Family, who some researchers believe were involved in the murders attributed to the &quot;Zodiac,&quot; who called and sent correspondence to Melvin Belli, </p>
<p>whose clients included the widow of Hermann Goering and Jack Ruby, who assassinated Lee Harvey Oswald, the purported assassin of John Kennedy, whose brother Robert was romantically linked to Jayne Mansfield, as was Anton LaVey, who served as Roman Polanski\'s technical director on the 1968 film Rosemary\'s Baby, which was set in New York\'s Dakota Apartments, where John Lennon was gunned down by Mark David Chapman, who shared a fixation on The Catcher in the Rye with failed assassin John Hinckley, Jr.</p>

            I’d love to know the absolute truth about everything involved in the Tate murder. One of the things that got my attention is how “W” spoke of the “1000 Lights” during a ceremony that honored Doris Tate, so could it be possible that the Tate’s were in to some evil shit themselves and therefore in on the sacrificial killing of Sharon, their first born?? And was Sharon complicit in anything involving child sex trafficking/porn/snuff?

              The killings perpetrated by the Manson Family were a part of the deep political landscape. The victims in all three instances were not randomly-selected.

              They were targeted for assassination and killed in a military-style operation. The caretaker in the guest cottage heard nothing and none of the dogs on the grounds reacted. The telephone lines around the home were cut. The scene was completely destroyed and staged.

              "We went to a bash at Roman Polanski's pad once, and I gave him my phone number. He was definitely not normal. He called several times and I finally told him he scared the shit out of me. He laughed like a hyena and never called again." (p. 297) He was of course later convicted of child molestation.
             </p>
             <p>
              There is evidence that Polanski was hosting sadomasochistic orgies at 10050 Cielo Drive and that these were well-attended by celebrities. A number of films were reportedly recovered by police. The victims were virtually all believed to be involved in drug trafficking operations and were all involved in the wide network of occult groups (usually with intelligence ties) as their killers. Victim Abigail Folger's friends included Charles Manson and William Mentzer, who is suspected in the ritual slayings of Arlis Perry and Roy Radin, and [who the LAPD described as] (

             </p>
             <p>
              In his autobiography, Sammy Davis, Jr. wrote that everyone at the house had been involved in Satanism. Family member Bobby Beausoleil, who murdered Gary Hinman, was a member of the Church of Satan, as was Susan Atkins. Atkins had belonged to an occult-themed strip dance performance called "the Topless Witches Review" and managed by Anton LaVey that performed at various mob-linked clubs in Las Vegas. She played a seductive vampire who would lick fake blood from her fingers before beckoning to the audience. On August 9, 1969, she would reportedly lick the blood from her fingers after viciously stabbing to death Sharon Tate, whose father was an Army Intelligence officer and who had been initiated into witchcraft two years earlier by "King of the Witches" Alexander Saunders.
             </p>
             <p>
              Gary Hinman was a meth dealer with extensive ties to the Manson Family and some of the biker gangs - all largely composed of former military and police personnel - it was connected with. It is reported that one of these gangs may have given the order for his elimination.
Leno LaBianca owed considerable gambling debts to the Mafia, including figures such as Frankie Carbo (The Shadow over Santa Susana by Adam Gorightly, p. 113), Manson had befriended at Terminal Island. His wife Rosemary was deeply immersed in the hallucinogen trade. Their phone lines were tapped.

            <blockquote>
             <p>
              Leno LaBianca was obsessed with horce racing and owned nine thoroughbreds. He owed large racetrack debts (Helter Skelter, p. 75) - reportedly up to $230,000 (The Ultimate Evil, p. 590), including $30,000 to Manson's prison friend, Frankie Carbo. Manson later told Geraldo Rivera: "I knew Frankie Carbo. Frankie Carbo knew Leno LaBianca." (The Shadow Over Santa Susana, p. 113) Carbo was [a professional killer employed by the Lucchese family.] (

              </a>
              ) Furthermore, LaBianca was president of the Gateway markets chain (which his father founded), which was missing $200,000 (The Family, p. 248), and was chief stockholder of its parent, the State Wholesale Grocery Company. (The Family, p. 234) He also sat on the board of the Hollywood National Bank (ibid), which was believed to have mob ties, alongside several men who had been convicted of fraud. (The Ultimate Evil, p. 590)
             </p>
             <p>
              Rosemary LaBianca was reported to be involved in underground LSD traffic. (The Ultimate Evil, p. 592) She was by far the wealthiest of all the victims, leaving her children an estate valued at $2.6 million..
             </p>
             <p>
              Her daughter from a previous relationship appeared at the scene of the crime after receiving a call from her brother. As [the New York Post reported in February 2012] (
              <a href="http://nypost.com/2012/02/26/flirt-with-danger/">

She visits, writes and has even advocated for his release ... Suzan and Tex [Watson] lived an estimated 200 feet apart in nearby apartments in Los Angeles for six months prior to Watson’s move into Manson’s home base, Spahn Ranch. Suzan’s then-boyfriend was a member of the motorcycle gang Straight Satans that often frequented Spahn Ranch." The article later states: "Maybe the "random" targeting of the LaBianca house wasn't so random."

             From that wideranging discussion, here's an interview with Kerry Thornely, friend of Lee Harvey Oswald:
            </p>
            <blockquote>
             <p>
              K.T.: The guy I talked to in New Orleans always said that they were going to get Martin Luther King. As for Bobby Kennedy, I don’t know. There’s one common thread that runs through all this stuff and that’s an organization that was organized shortly after Kennedy’s death and that was the PROCESS CHURCH.
             </p>
             <p>
              W.C.H.: I’m familiar with that.
             </p>
             <p>
              K.T.: They had tried to frame me in New Orleans for something I didn’t do, which had been my actual participation in the assassination, which I didn’t realize until later. They were involved in Kennedy’s death somehow, I believe. That might be the link right there.
             </p>
             <p>
              W.C.H.: They seemed to almost be a Manson like cult.
             </p>
             <p>
              K.T.: Some of them were. Some of them were with Papa Doc Devallier, some were with Trudeau, (laughs) I forget the other name…but there were three questions to find out whether you were a Satanist, a Luciferian, and a Jehovist. The Satanist answer was Papa Doc; the Luciferian answer was Trudeau. So their politics were quite varied.
             </p>

              According to ex-cult member Timothy Wyllie in his book
              <em>
               Love Sex Fear Death
              </em>
              New Orleans attorney Thomas Baumler who worked out of Guy Bannister's office drew up articles of incorporation for the Process Church. This ties into Thornley's story.

               William Joseph Bryan, Jr. (1926–1977)
              </a>
              was an American physician and a pioneering hypnotist. He was one of the founders of the modern hypnotherapy and his work notably found use in psychological warfare during the Cold War.[1] He was a great grandson of United States Secretary of State William Jennings Bryan.
             </p>
             <p>
              He started his career as a military psychiatrist, and was involved in research for the CIA, including the Project ARTICHOKE and its successor, the Project MKUltra (popularly known as the CIA's mind control program), a research project into behavioral engineering of humans. As part of his work for the CIA, he developed techniques of what he called "hypno-conditioning." His published research from the era focused on the forensic and military range of psychological research. He would later focus on legal hypnosis.

              Well I had hoped my follow up 'con't post described it, and I was planning to add more streamlined info.  I was just amazed that someone on a blog could lay out that much info which PG researchers will know right away much of the back story.  It's the exercise of pulling a thread out of the hairball from hell so to speak.  To add anything to the original, I'll have to cut out some and move it to the second part.  Which I can do if you really really want me to :)
