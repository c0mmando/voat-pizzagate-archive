<ol>
<li>Billionaire Erik Prince, founder of Blackwater, gave a lengthy interview where he said that basically everything #pizzagate was real, based on his discussions with NYPD:</li>
</ol>
<p><a href="http://www.breitbart.com/radio/2016/11/04/erik-prince-nypd-ready-make-arrests-weiner-case/">http://www.breitbart.com/radio/2016/11/04/erik-prince-nypd-ready-make-arrests-weiner-case/</a></p>
<p>It would be pretty strange if billionaire Brock, whose company depends on his reputation, just massively lied about the NYPD, considering his success and reputation in law enforcement and the military.</p>
<ol>
<li>Steve Pieczenik, Pieczenik was Deputy Assistant Secretary of State under Henry Kissinger, Cyrus Vance and James Baker. His expertise includes foreign policy, international crisis management and psychological warfare. He served the presidential administrations of Gerald Ford, Jimmy Carter, Ronald Reagan and George H. W. Bush in the capacity of deputy assistant secretary.</li>
</ol>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12zVlaZyX3Q">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12zVlaZyX3Q</a></p>
<ol>
<li>General Flynn, retired United States Army lieutenant general who last served as the 18th Director of the Defense Intelligence Agency, commander of the Joint Functional Component Command for Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance, chair of the Military Intelligence Board, Assistant Director of National Intelligence, and the senior intelligence officer for the Joint Special Operations Command, and future National Security Advisor under Trump.</li>
</ol>
<p>Flynn tweeted a story about pizzagate, writing &quot;You decide. NYPD blows whistle on new Hillary e-mails, money laundering, sex crimes with children, et cetera. Must read.&quot;</p>
<p>It would be very odd for the former Director of the Defense Intelligence Agency to tweet out a bizarre conspiracy theory if he did not think that it was true, or plausibly true. That would be like John Podesta tweeting a story that Trump is secretly a German spy. It is also presumable that Flynn has enough connections in the intelligence community to actually know what is true.</p>
<ol>
<li>Roger Stone, principle of the lobbying firm Black, Manafort, Stone and Kelly, &quot;veteran Republican strategist,&quot; Trump advisor and &quot;confidante.&quot;</li>
</ol>
<p>He has participated in Infowars shows where #pizzagate was heavily discussed and investigated.</p>
<ol>
<li>Matt Drudge on October 16 tweeted &quot;Oh, on the sex stuff. Hillary is about to get hers...&quot; The Tweet is now gone, presumably deleted. People think he was talking Wikileaks, before Wikileaks decided not to publish stage three of its Hillary emails (or was compromised).</li>
