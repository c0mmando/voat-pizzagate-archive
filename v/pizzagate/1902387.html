<p>Some of this has already been seen on here and /pol/ 4chan but Jim goes into more details he shows you why the DNC powers had to kill Seth Rich after what he learned. Hillary belongs in prison along with all her DNConspirators: </p>
<p>Hillary\'s fake polling stations, People DO NOT GET IT</p>
<p>The girlfriend of Seth Rich blew the whistle on this in an e-mail farther down this page. People seem to not understand the process Hillary used, so Let me explain this again:</p>
<p>Here is the misunderstanding:</p>
<p>Alex sent: How strongly vetted is this \'covert polling station\' angle? The strategy sounds too good not to be true, but then the logic around it, seems confusing: If there are covert voting stations, wouldn\'t the turnout be higher than expected? So be careful, mate -Alex</p>
<p>My response: If Hillary set up duplicate polling stations that were not on the record, and used her web site to direct people to them without the people even knowing they were fake, and then got nearly 100 percent of the vote at her own polling stations, which were then SUBTRACTED: UNDERSTAND THIS: THEY WERE SUBTRACTED AND NOT ADDED to the legitimate polling stations, by taking 100 PERCENT HILLARY VOTES AND SWAPPING THEM OUT FOR ONLY LEGITIMATE BERNIE SANDERS VOTES at the legitimate polling stations, voter turnout would appear to be low, not high.</p>
<p>She had to keep the number of votes that were cast equal to the official register at the real polling place, and had a duplicate register that was then shredded. This means that everyone who voted on her duplicate register vanished from the system when the votes that went to her at her secret polling stations were swapped into the official register, replacing Bernie votes with ZERO VOTES IN NUMBER ACTUALLY ADDED TO THE OFFICIAL REGISTER. Only votes were switched, NONE were added.</p>
<p>In Hillary\'s plan, EVERYONE got to vote, and predominantly only Hillary votes actually showed up in the end. :The corruption it took to make this happen was unfathomable. People at the DNC actually had to sit down, take Hillary\'s votes from her bogus polling stations, and swap them in place of Bernie\'s votes from the legitimate polling place and do this completely knowing what was going on. Since there were two sets of polling stations, and the total from only one set actually made the record, &quot;voter turnout was low&quot;. The register from the original polling place remained intact, while Hillary\'s registers were shredded to destroy the evidence after they were used to make a perfectly accurate forgery out of the official record.</p>
<p>This was a complicated process that required cooperation at a very high level. The powers that be wanted Hillary. They wanted her so badly they even gave her the voting machines in jurisdictions that used them, and perfect duplicate ballots in jurisdictions that used them. Her polling stations were perfect versions of the actual polling stations. No one who used Hillary\'s web site to find the polling stations, rather than the DNC web site, would know anything was amiss at all.</p>
<p>If you misunderstood this, please re-read what the whistleblower said. This is posted down this page a ways.</p>
<p>Since Seth Rich managed the software that told people where to vote on Hillary\'s web site, when he figured out what Hillary did and then disagreed, he had to be killed.
But they did not nail him until AFTER he became disgusted with what happened and gave the DNC mails to Wikileaks. At that time, the DNC probably did not even know Seth Rich did the leak, they just wanted him dead because he figured out Hillary\'s scam, and was going to blow the whistle.</p>
<p>The following answer to why Seth Rich was killed has been bumped to the top again because it is important
I am posting this exactly as I got it.
The answer to why Seth Rich was killed, and why he gave to Wikileaks is now out.
Seth Rich was responsible for an internet application that helped voters find their polling stations.
He discovered that Hillary had set up bogus polling places that were not on the official record. Hillary then had DNC staffers merge the results from both sets of polling places, keeping the actual number of voters officially recorded at the legitimate polling station the same while the actual ballots that went to Bernie and represented those numbers were swapped out for her.</p>
<p>Seth Rich was appalled by the corruption, and as a result, dumped to Wikileaks.</p>
<p>This answer has been out there since July 21 of 2016 and it rotted until it was recently discovered in a private E-mail.</p>
<p>This was sent to me &quot;as written by Claudia Kash, the girlfriend of Seth Rich,&quot; people have sent corrections saying Claudia Kash was the recipient of the mail. This was written shortly after Seth was killed. The answer has been out there since the beginning.</p>
<p>&quot;There were two sets of polling places this primary season - one set for most of the voters, who went on state web sites to find their polling locations, and a second set for Hillary Clinton supporters who looked on Hillary clinton\'s website to find their polling location. The secretary of state for each state had one set of locations on the record, the other set of locations, the ones listed on Hillary\'s website were not on the state record. I know this because I looked on her website to find where a friend should vote, then double checked the state website, which showed a different address. I thought there must be a mistake - I kept checking right up to election day. But until they killed Seth Rich, I couldn\'t figure out why there would be two different polling places. This is how I think the scam worked: While most voters look up their location on their state website, voters who were signed up as Hillary Clinton supporters would be directed to her site to find their polling place. It was set up the same as any other DNC polling place - with DNC volunteers, regular voting machines etc - and a duplicate voter roster, the same as the roster at the other polling place. Voters would be checked off on the roster, same as at the other polling place, and after the polls colsed, the DNC supervisor would pick up the roster and the ballots.</p>
<p>The supervisor would then pick up the roster at the legitimate polling place and the ballots there. He (or she) would then replace a number of Bernie Sanders ballots with an equal number of the ballots from the Hillary Clinton voting location. Then the duplicate roster from the HRC would be shredded and thrown away, along with all the Bernie Sanders ballots that had been replaced. That way the number of people who voted on the remaining roster still matches the number of ballots. This is why so many states reported a &quot;lower than expected voter turnout&quot;. Seth Rich, who was responsible for the app that helped voters find their polling places did not realize there were two sets of polling places until he himself went to vote. He lived in Washington DC, which voted at the end of the primary season, a week after Clinton had already been declared the winner. I believe he discovered it then and had started asking questions about why the polling places on Hillary\'s web site didn\'t match the ones on the DC web site.</p>
<p>But even if he didn\'t say a word to anybody, it would have been dangerous to let him live. He would have figured it out sooner or later, and he would have reported it when he did.&quot;</p>
<p>My comment: Let me then, fill in the blanks: Seth rich DID figure out Hillary did this, and said nothing. Instead, he did the DNC leaks to Wikileaks, hopefully to bring the whole house of cards down. The timing is so close on all of this that it can\'t really be known if Seth was killed because he knew Hillary\'s plot, or if he was killed because someone figured out it was him who did the leaks.</p>
<p>To sum this up in a short statement: Hillary set up duplicate polling stations, collected a second set of votes that never showed up at the legitimate polling place, and then flipped the voter ID information at the legitimate polling stations and swapped it out with votes from her polling stations exclusively on legitimate ballots where people voted for Bernie Sanders. She\'d have to be mega corrupt and powerful to do this, and the DNC would have to be rotten to the core, but that is probably so when the Clinton death machine is never forced to give answers. That means there is serious deeply rooted corruption and dark power. Seth Rich found out, was having none of it, and then died.</p>
<p>One reader wrote asking why it would make a difference. The answer: If a Bernie Sanders vote is completely deleted and replaced with a Clinton vote, that\'s a two vote loss for Bernie. The votes were not combined, on set of votes was used to destroy competing votes in another set of votes. The duplicate rosters made it possible to keep the number of voters matching the number of ballots cast, while one was used to delete Bernie votes from the other. Once the job was done, the duplicate roster and switched votes were shredded.</p>',

            can anyone provide links to the original source of these alleged emails revealing the double sets of polling stations?  I am 100% confident that the election was rigged for HRC but if this method was used, it seems like it should be fairly easy to prove. One example, if you go to a voter database it will say when a person last voted. Shouldn't there be millions of people who voted for HRC who do not have the primary listed in their voting history? While HRC voters are least likely to want to check on this, I'm sure all of us know a few people who voted for HRC, couldn't we look them up and start seeing if we find any significant number of people who say they voted for HRC who do not have a record of having voted that day?

            Thanks.  I hope they read it, this country needs to get informed about the voting process and the fraud involved.  Many believe their is rampant voter fraud.  No.  There is rampant Election Fraud committed by our govt.

            Several comments: I read all the posts and the comments, long or short. How else do you learn anything? And I think it's respectful to your colleagues who take the time and trouble to post. A decision was made to allow Seth Rich posts to remain on Pizzagate for the time being while encouraging folks to move over to the SR forum.  The murder is a unique issue which simultaneously touches on the far reaching powers of the Clinton/Podesta Gang,  the validity of the Russian narrative and the apparent corruption of  Washington DC  police. We can suffer through it for awhile.

            I've got problems with the Claudia Kash story. How could such a vast nationwide fraud with dual voting sites escape detection such that only a few insiders within the D.N.C. knew about it and only Seth Rich  uncovered it? Claudia is not his girlfriend (until someone finds such evidence) She runs the website Hillary Research Group and in the course of discussing the murder with other posters (one of whom was Irv Beiman) put forth this dual voting booth scenario without any explanation as to how she learned of the scheme and never mentioned that she knew Seth. So we are right back where we started from. .

            HillPedo and the Evil Pedo Cabal does not care if we all knew she is a Lesbian Satanic Pedo Cannibalist, who cheats, lies, steals  &amp; kills! 
Cheating Bernie was a given! Look at the delegate count rigging. 
Voater fraud was not what Seth was killed for!
Hell, since JFK it's a given that the LibTards rig the elections! 
So, focus people what was Seth sent to the DNC to find?

             The link below is to a source that is probably gatekeeper but still some nuggets surface.  LC also hates anyone who is not white and straight so be forewarned.
            </p>
            <p>
             I found the connection to Warren B  (clinton crony and pedo) picture with a young Seth very interesting and the hypothesis of Seth having a panda fixation/and his family's very strange presser 2 days after Seth was murdered/the smirking brother just one example.
            </p>
            <p>
             Consider...and I'm just speculating...Seth, a Bernie fan, finds voter fraud, but uncovers a whole lot more.  He would know, if he was a victim of SRA, the many pedo references.  Another point, the cannibal painting on podesta's wall/Seth would recognize the significance.  Plus it seems like this pedo network is fairly well known in DC circles.
            </p>
            <p>
             So back to your question/did Seth just stumble on the pedo emails or was he looking for that?
            </p>
            <p>
             Which also begs the question just how much was leaked to wiki...and how much is Julian sitting on???

              I believe strongly that Kim.com &amp; Assange are sitting on more valuable info from Seth. Probably Pedo related.
             </p>
             <p>
              Seth was led to those DNC emails. 
Seth &amp; or his parents have been abused or abuse. Hence, the panda obsession. Now, did whoever it was that led Seth to the DNC know this?
             </p>
             <p>
              Was this revenge on the Pedos for whoever led Seth, or for Seth?

              It is not voter fraud.  It is Election Fraud when committed by the govt.  When committed by the public it is voter fraud. I have studied this for quite some time.

            Way too confusing and complicated. They would have to have people at every station flipping numbers and making judgement calls left and right. She is not the Manhattan Project. 
They unregistered Bernie voters by the 100's of thousands, maybe millions, which doesn't pull Seth from being the leaker of emails. Seems like a misdirection...

             Yes, confusing and complicated.  Just like their pedophile rings, organ harvesting and drug running outfits, a cast of thousands and plans so intricate that they are hard to unwind.  Oh the tangled web..... that is their MO.  That is why we have had trouble convincing normies, these plans are made to be unbelievable.

             If that is the case, then  all of the Seth Rich posts are not relative?  I believe they are.  We are researching pizza/pedogate, because of what was in the Podesta emails.  Seth Rich gave those emails to Wikileaks, and if it had not been for him, we would not have a reason  to investigate. Also, Seth Rich has exposed  deep and evil election fraud (not voter fraud) committed by the DNC, Hillary Clinton and many of the people running elections in our states.  If this is proven, there will be an investigation of monumental proportions. This must be exposed in the media.  NOW.

               Anything is possible as we well know, but so much points to Seth, Assange's award and hints, plus Craig Murray's admitting he was the go between from Seth to Julian.  Braverman would not have the anger and disgust the a Bernie voter would have had.  He was a person, I believe, that wanted to follow the rules and just had to turn her in.

                Yes, I am open to all possibilities. Wikileaks time the release of their information well, so they may simply have been sitting on it. PS: Craig Murray says the Podesta leaks were likely from the intelligence community.
               </p>
               <blockquote>
                <p>
                 “The Podesta emails and the DNC emails are, of course, two separate things and we shouldn’t conclude that they both have the same source,” Murray said. “In both cases we’re talking of a leak, not a hack, in that the person who was responsible for getting that information out had legal access to that information…
                </p>
                <p>
                 Scott Horton then asked, “Is it fair to say that you’re saying that the Podesta leak came from inside the intelligence services, NSA [the electronic spying National Security Agency] or another agency?”
                </p>
                <p>
                 “I think what I said was certainly compatible with that kind of interpretation, yeah,” Murray responded. “In both cases they are leaks by Americans.”

                 I don't know if I saw it on here or when I was researching, but Craig Murray has applied for a temporary visa to the US for an event.  He has never had a problem before, but this time he is being denied.  Very odd.  Something tells me they do not want any of that info you just sent to get to the mainland.  No one told them about the internet?

              I read it all. I have read many on here that were even longer.  What is your problem?  That is how investigations are done, a lot of leg  work.

               , agree! While it's a long explanation of what happened, it needs to be so that it's laid now clearly and fully for newbies, especially. Plus you made it so that we can all easily copy and paste A FULL EXPLANATION of what with down with no extra leg work on our part. Thank you for the time you spent on it! :-)
