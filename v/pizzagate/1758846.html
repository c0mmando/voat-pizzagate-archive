            Clinton had one condition that eclipsed all others as she considered Obama's offer to be secretary of state: She demanded hiring authority at the department. To Team Clinton, this meant every political job -- about 200 -- from the most senior level to the 20-something researchers. Historically, it is the president who fills these political positions, and no one can recall a Cabinet secretary in recent memory requesting and receiving this kind of hiring latitude. ...She became a heroine to the Foreign Service when she went to bat to get funding for 3,000 new Foreign Service positions for State operations and the U.S. Agency for International Development -- the first boost of this magnitude in two decades.... To be sure, Clinton has her share of critics who take aim at her operating style, complaining that she has ceded too much of her power to special envoys and that she has been in a global campaign mode of relentless image-building, intense travel and international media cultivation. One loyalist inside the agency, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to be candid, suggested that Clinton is stretched too thin and has not narrowed her goals or developed signature issues that will define her tenure. "What bothers me is that we're planting zillions of seeds . . . speeches on every issue, but where's the thematic coherence?" this aide said. Stewart M. Patrick, a senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations who worked at the State Department under Colin L. Powell, agreed that Clinton "seems to still be struggling with priorities" and questioned whether she has a "grand strategic vision." (

            <p>
             “Recently, the State Department informed the Committee that six additional Secretary Clinton staff at State were designated as her research assistants which allowed them to retain their clearances after leaving the Department,” Grassley added.

             The State Department has not yet responded it an inquiry from Fox News as to whether Clinton, or her staff, including then-chief of staff Cheryl Mills, Huma Abedin, her traveling chief of staff and former assistant, who went on to become the vice chair of her presidential campaign, and Jake Sullivan, her senior policy advisor, still have access to the classified and top-secret archives and systems.

            This is what we need more of.  Public servants--government officials, people who work at the coalface--coming out and telling the truth about how government policies are made that KNOWINGLY hurt people the government professes it is trying to protect.   This woman is a star.

            The article talks about the child advocacy group, "Bravehearts" who themselves have been accused of covering for pedophiles.

            Dolan is calling for MORE child advocacy groups.  In a respectable world, that would be a good thing but we know what kind of people are attracted to those sorts of groups.  Very sad.

            It's getting really difficult to claim everything is a psy op / honey pot / false flag when it would literally require a time machine in order for that to be the case.  Sometimes things are just what they are.

             My brother told me the other day that maybe I should stop focusing on pizzagate because it's probably a psy-op.  I said "with all due respect, I've been reading probably 12-50 articles a day piecing this shit together.  For the last, what, 8 months?  I've focused heavily on the podesta emails, the clinton emails, and vault 7.  They're all connected.  You can think it's a psy-op all you want, but how dare you tell
             <em>
              me
             </em>
             that it is?  What have you researched?"  To which, he had nothing to say.  Typical SJW leftist faggot.

               Well, I was one of those people as well.  It wasn't until the drop of the Podesta Files that I ended up redpilling myself.  It's funny because I have said since 2003 probably that the government did 9/11 but I never really entertained the notion, for some reason, that maybe they were still doing some shady shit.  I got hornswaggled by Facebook hashtags and the gay movement.  I was a sheep, he too will no longer be a sheep.  He's getting closer every day, I can see it.

              Yeah that's one of the parts that makes me angriest. When you've sold your soul to the process of red pilling and research. Reading a shitload of material to form enough puzzle pieces to paint a clear picture of the truth, and then weak motherfuckers try and dismiss you because they saw a 3 paragraph pile of fucking rubbish on their fbook feed. Tilts me lol

               fake news by design is easy to access ,  to reach the most people ,  to prevent them from reading a shitload of material .. doing what you are doing .. look at the cost of fake news to produce .. it would cost  fortunes to pepper history with fake news in the "hopes" someone "discovers it" .. latter on.. this is real .. remember sites that pushed fake Hillary health records and reports of killing the father of a doctor ..Alex Jones pushed the parkinsons angle.. I'll tell you right now , her fainting dehydration is from alcoholism , media covered it in 08' , im an alcoholic ,20yrs sober , im getting off topic , sorry. Hillary won't drink water ect..this is real .. you people rock..keep it up .. getting back.. people would grab articles by that international court site waste hours looping back with no real nuggets , they show and disprove it so now everything is fake...Bullshit .. they have to have some truth in there to make the connection in peoples minds to ignore the little crumbs that you are putting together now..

               Clinton had one condition that eclipsed all others as she considered Obama's offer to be secretary of state: She demanded hiring authority at the department. To Team Clinton, this meant every political job -- about 200 -- from the most senior level to the 20-something researchers. Historically, it is the president who fills these political positions, and no one can recall a Cabinet secretary in recent memory requesting and receiving this kind of hiring latitude. ...She became a heroine to the Foreign Service when she went to bat to get funding for 3,000 new Foreign Service positions for State operations and the U.S. Agency for International Development -- the first boost of this magnitude in two decades....
To be sure, Clinton has her share of critics who take aim at her operating style, complaining that she has ceded too much of her power to special envoys and that she has been in a global campaign mode of relentless image-building, intense travel and international media cultivation. 
One loyalist inside the agency, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to be candid, suggested that Clinton is stretched too thin and has not narrowed her goals or developed signature issues that will define her tenure. "What bothers me is that we're planting zillions of seeds . . . speeches on every issue, but where's the thematic coherence?" this aide said.
Stewart M. Patrick, a senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations who worked at the State Department under Colin L. Powell, agreed that Clinton "seems to still be struggling with priorities" and questioned whether she has a "grand strategic vision."

              It probably is a psy-op but not in the way he thinks. Pizzagate was a likely an information-warfare-bomb dropped by the Russians on the Globalists.

                Russia is definitely not the bad guy. On the contrary they're a beacon of hope. The more western politicians and MSM foam at the mouth vilifying this country, the more suspicious it becomes in the eyes of people.

                Nope Russia is not the bad guy.  Russia is in my view only protecting its interests which have been under threat by the Globalists. The Globalists have of course relentlessly painted the Russians as the ogres.  That is really the new war now - the Globalists vs Everyone Else - and its being waged primarily as an information war.

              My dad told me the other day that I should just forget about pizzagate because he'd "asked all the guys at work about it and nobody had even heard of it".. As for it being a psyop, there's waaaaay too much evidence against that I agree.

                My dad called pizzagate "dangerous right wing propaganda" based on what he read here on voat, he also voted against Scottish independence when we are anti-royalist and have a strong family history of Irish republicanism.  Surely there is no such thing as a psy-op the only logical explanation I can think of is we are being invaded by the body snatchers because I feel like almost everyone I know has gone insane I mean ffs me and all of my friends have been lefties, like most people in Scotland, since high school and 15 years later they're making pro-establishment anti-free speech arguments any time I mention this stuff. Arrggghhhhhhhh
