<p><strong>I know this was posted about it when the news broke, but this is a just-published article with updates.  To quote from the article:</strong></p>
<hr />
<p>&quot;The sordid backgrounds of Southern Baptist ministers didn\'t stop them from finding new jobs at churches and working in positions of trust.</p>
<p>They\'re among at least 35 Southern Baptist pastors, youth ministers and volunteers who were convicted of sex crimes or accused of sexual misconduct but still were allowed to work at churches during the past two decades, an investigation by the San Antonio Express-News and the Houston Chronicle reveals.</p>
<p>Some were suspected of misconduct but were allowed to leave quietly and work elsewhere. Others had been arrested, had criminal records or even had to register as sex offenders but later found jobs at Baptist churches.</p>
<p>All the men worked at times for churches in the Southern Baptist Convention, the largest coalition of Baptist churches in the United States.</p>
<p>The SBC has rejected efforts to establish a registry to track sexual abuse cases and prevent churches from hiring predatory pastors. In some cases, churches knew of a pastor\'s past and allowed him to work anyway. In others, the SBC\'s inaction might have allowed offenders to move from community to community, ruining lives as they slipped through background checks and found jobs at unsuspecting churches.</p>
<p>&quot;There\'s no other group that does pass the buck better,&quot; said Dee Ann Miller, a longtime victims\' rights activist in Kansas who speaks out against sexual abuse by Baptist ministers and clergy in other faiths.</p>
<p>The practice of hiring pastors with disturbing pasts is part of a broader problem of sex abuse at Southern Baptist churches across the United States, the newspapers\' investigation shows.</p>
<p>At least 700 people — nearly all of them children — reported being sexually abused by those who worked or volunteered at Southern Baptist churches since 1998. Records show that about 220 Southern Baptist church leaders and volunteers have been convicted of sex crimes or took plea deals. The charges range from possessing child pornography to raping children.&quot;</p>',

            Anyone that has done any amount of research into CSA/SRA knows that this kind of abuse is rampant every organized religion on the planet due to the orchestrated and inside attack on the church by the freemasons and templars. This generational abuse is especially prevalent in southern baptist churches due to influence from the templar created KKK. This is to be expected so that thousands upon thousands flee the church WAITING for the replacementt religion to save us all from the sin!

            Baptist’s don’t have dioceses like the RCC. They ultimately police themselves. They do their own screening of hires. This is a recipe for disaster imo. The Catholic Church is a mess but at least we have been able to hold Bishops and Cardinals responsible for their abusive priests. I don’t think there will be much done to change their system. The sicko culture of this faith are satisfied with how things are.
