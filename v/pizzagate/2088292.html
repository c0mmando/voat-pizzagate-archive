<p>This is PG-relevant because the Trump administration has failed to prosecute or investigate PG. And now he has pardoned a Sheriff who refused to properly investigate child rape. Trump is implicated in pedophilia by his unnatural attraction to his own daughter, his interest in 12 year old girls, his connections to Epstein and his bragging about busting into the dressing room at the Miss Teen USA pageant.

<p>Sheriff Joe neglects underage rape victims:
How the MCSO Neglected a 14-Year-Old Rape Victim
<a href="http://www.phoenixnewtimes.com/news/how-the-mcso-neglected-a-14-year-old-rape-victim-and-went-to-town-on-phoenix-mayor-phil-gordon-6438580">http://www.phoenixnewtimes.com/news/how-the-mcso-neglected-a-14-year-old-rape-victim-and-went-to-town-on-phoenix-mayor-phil-gordon-6438580</a></p>
<p>Arpaio\'s office failed to investigate child molestation:</p>
<p><a href="http://archive.boston.com/news/nation/articles/2011/12/04/critics_tough_sheriff_botched_sex_crime_cases/?page=full">http://archive.boston.com/news/nation/articles/2011/12/04/critics_tough_sheriff_botched_sex_crime_cases/?page=full</a></p>
<p>“Both cases were among more than 400 sex-crimes reported to Maricopa County Sheriff Joe Arpaio\'s office during a three-year period ending in 2007 -- including dozens of alleged child molestations -- that were inadequately investigated and in some instances were not worked at all, according to current and former police officers familiar with the cases.
In El Mirage alone, where Arpaio\'s office was providing contract police services, officials discovered at least 32 reported child molestations -- with victims as young as 2 years old -- where the sheriff\'s office failed to follow through, even though suspects were known in all but six cases.”</p>
<p>Suspects were known, but not investigated? Clearly Arpaio was protecting his pedo buddies. And now Trump is protecting him.</p>
<p>There\'s lots more on Arpaio and his protection of pedophiles. This post will probably be deleted, though. If it is, you know exactly why.</p>

            Seems to me Nazis were held in high regard precisely because they closed down all the drag shows and pedophile dens which the
            <strong>
             Jews
            </strong>
            had set up. Is that not a historical fact, making you completely full of shit?

             The Nazis had a concentartion camp full of Polish children:
             <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potulice_concentration_camp">
              https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potulice_concentration_camp
             </a>
            </p>
            <blockquote>
             <p>
              Children were also beaten in the face with canes, imprisoned in a bunker that was filled with water up to their knees, or denied food for days. The sight of dying prisoners who couldn’t fend off rats attacking them was also a traumatic experience for many. German guards also engaged in psychological torture; for example, the starving children were placed near tables on which bread, cabbage, and cereals were put and the guards would take photographs of the scene, after which the food was taken away from the children. The camp was used also for involuntary blood donations from the young children. There were children born in the camp. These infants faced a harsh fate as their exhausted mothers weren’t able to feed them and the food rations were always in short supply. As a result, infants born in the camp usually weighed around 1 kilo and died after a few weeks.

             The problem with history is that it is all revisionist.  We really don't know anything about our past, far less the present.

              I was asking RHETORICALLY. Obviously its a historical fact, theres video and contemporaneous accounts.  Jews introduce degeneracy to undermine the culture, and thats exactly how the Nazis described it.

            Nothing new to see. It's what the Hillyland crowd does. They project onto others what they are. It means staining something with the pig scum they're covered in. They're pedos so the opposition is pedos. (yawn) Can't Pedosta think up something new?

           <p>
            Your asses are in the grinder, Lib_nut. (1) Awan is in prison; (2) Trump is in discussions with Assange for evidence that will lead to not only charges of those who have perjured themselves by floating a false narrative, but to the murderers of Seth Rich; and (3) Sessions is subpeonaing the IP addresses of your friends at ANTIFA, BLM, and whatever other acronyms you can think up. How about LOSERS? How about PEDOS? How about GETTINGSCAREDOFPRISONSOYOULLSAYANYTHINGTHATSHITSOUTYOURASS?

           <p>
            In March, Sessions already addressed the opioid scourge sweeping WV and other places! The opioid plague that your friends created! They know what's up and any pedos out there better be expecting a knock on their door! No more getting off because they're friends with The Cannibal Queen! Assange has what will put you all in prison and he's about to bring PedoWood down around your collective ears!

                Let's see, so The Cannibal Elite didn't make headway when the accused Trump of colluding with Russians, or when they killed Seth Rich and sad it was a robbery gone wrong, or when they hired bimbos/kanks before the election to say Trump grope them a hundred years ago, or a reporter that says she was almost thrown to the ground and presented a photo of a bruised wrist that displayed a mole as proof when she didn't even have a mole, or picking on eleven-year-old kid, or saying the POTUS is a white supremacist and Nazi, or saying that he incites violence, or that he's crazy, or that the country will fall apart without the lousy mandated Kenyan-devised healthcare that's only been around for seven years even though the US didn't have it for over 200 years and did just fine, or when MK Ultra controlled Trudeau and Macron said nasty things because Soros told them to, or when Pedosta goes on a rant and instead of telling why he colluded with the Russians and was carrying around a pizza-related mapped handkerchief or did lobbying work for the Russians spins false narratives to keep his perv ass out of prison, or when The Cannibal Queen emerges from those walks in the woods looking like Grizzly Adams when clinically depressed and with a vagina says her skin crawled being around Trump but that it didn't when her alleged rapist/abuser husband put his hands on her all those years. So now they've returned to the narrative that Trump is a pedo and protects pedos when all there's been is arrest after arrest of pedos since he's been in office.
               </p>
               <p>
                So shake in your boots and do what Soros pays you to. Those allegations are made by more Soros paid shills, just like the allegations of the porn queen whose major complaint of being molested by Trump was, "He didn't ask permission before he kissed." This from a skank who makes a living by having whipped cream pies shoved up her ass.

                Yup, keep slinging that mud. It's not going to stick, but since you're bottom feeders, it's the only thing you can reach.

                  Let's get to the pertinent point of how paid shills will burn in hell forever for: (1) slandering good folk who can't do anything about mothers that abscond with abused children in the middle of the night; and (2) actually posting false narratives for Soros bitcoins.

            Brave post, lol.  I also think we're not going to get much joy from Trump and his administration.  Time people moved away from partisan politics.  Trump was painted as a non-politician during campaigning.  But we now know that his team used behaviorial analytics to appeal to the disgruntled masses.  I initially gave him the benefit of the doubt when elected but nope, I think the honeymoon period is well and truly over.

             Honeymoon period definitely over, but, to call him a pedo seems terribly reminiscent of the lame sex-life smearing that Trump copped during the primaries... I dunno, I really just don't know what to think of trump anymore.

               It's part of what conflicts me... is he playing the long game and making moves that are perceivable as a betrayal to us, because of the difficult position and task? Or, is he baiting us along, like every other fucker, for as long as possible until they're ready to drop the hammer on our toes, instead of who we're after?

             But I still think Sheriff Joe is a POS racist jerk for racially profiling Hispanics, especially in that part of the country where they have lived far longer than white people. Arizona used to be part of Mexico. You can't just target people for "lookin' Mexkin.". This pardon is the worst thing Trump has done so far. Do the crime, do the time.

              Their job is to apprehend illegals from SOUTH OF THE BORDER, WHICH IS MEXICO. How is it racist that Mexicans happen to have a different skin tone?  You are a ridiculous person.

            If Trump were a pedo, TPTB would have blackmail on him. Clearly not the case or there would be no massive freak out and impeachment talk! It is common sense and THIS post is one of the reasons we need to go back to 100 points before someone is allowed to post.

            You're determined, I'll give you that. I'm still pretty sure this is crap though. If I'm wrong, ignore me, I mean no harm.

            If I'm right, well, I guess give up and fuggoff? One way or another, I'm gonna remain reserved until more experienced 'gaters give their thoughts.
