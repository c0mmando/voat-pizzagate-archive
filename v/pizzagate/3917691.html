             The legislation, supported by Relativity Media and Steve Bing's Shangri-La business group, may move forward for a final vote Friday night.
            </h2>
            <p>
             It look like it will be surf’s up for Hollywood in Hawaii.
            </p>
            <p>
             Legislation supported by the rapidly expanding Hollywood studio Relativity Media and Steve Bing’s Shangri-La business group is before a conference committee of the Hawaii state legislature and may be forwarded for a final vote as soon as tonight. The state House of Representatives and Senate are expected to approve it by the end of June and the governor has already promised to sign it into law.
            </p>
            <p>
             The bill would raise film production tax credits for movies shot in Hawaii from the current 15 percent to 35 percent on Oahu, the island where Honolulu is located, and from 20 percent to 40 percent in the rest of the state.
            </p>
            <p>
             It would make tax credits easier to sell or assign to others, and would remove a cap on how much the state will spend annually to support film production.
            </p>
            <p>
             The bill would also exempt productions that shoot for a long period of time from hotel room taxes and provide an additional 5% bonus for special and visual effects and animation done in the islands.

            I can also confirm that:
           </p>
           <ul>
            <li>
             Relativity Media has ties to Deustche Bank:
             <a href="https://archive.is/KU5AY">
              https://archive.is/KU5AY
             </a>
            </li>
            <li>
             Relativity Media has/had ties to Steve Mnuchin:
             <a href="https://archive.is/m4l8E">
              https://archive.is/m4l8E
             </a>
            </li>
           </ul>
           <p>
            However, and this is by no means a defense of him, I find the Mnuchin -&gt; Next / Brunel / Kates connection a bit strenuous and otherwise unconfirmed. Nonetheless, Mnuchin remains firmly on my radar as I recall his name coming up many times in other ongoing research of mine.
           </p>
           <p>
            As an aside – and again not a defense of him – Mnuchin pledged, in 2019, to have Deustche Bank investigated "following a New York Times report alleging the bank failed to submit suspicious activity reports related to companies linked to President Trump and his son-in-law, Jared Kushner":
            <a href="https://archive.is/1zUiY">

            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            Just for good measure, I'll stress this one last time:
            <em>
             I am not at all defending Mnuchin (et al), he and others will be mentioned by me in the future.

            I don't think Maxwell is a "distraction".  The possible loss of thousands of incriminating videos from

            puts her at a huge disadvantage. She may still have many more tapes at her disposal to use as blackmail for her court case but she may give u tapes of Andrew if threatened. My opinion is they will go into the same black hole Weiner's laptop.
           </p>
           <p>
            As an aside, the state is showing details about some of Maxwell's hidden wealth in order to argue against bail -

              It might have made the Daily Mail, but it's got "conspiracy theory conspiracy theory conspiracy theory" running right the way through it. The publishers know the average Daily Mail reader is conditioned to not believe anything that they use the trigger words conspiracy theory to describe.

             - Ernie Allen is one of the attendees at the Sedona Forum . The participant list shows he is part of the
             <strong>
              McCain Institute's Human Trafficking Advisory Counci
             </strong>
             l and also the president of NCMEC. I saw a few voat posts on Ernie Allen, so he could be another person looking into.

             Richard Koca, co-founder of StandUp for Children, convicted on 22 counts of sex assault
            </a>
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             Richard Koca traveled the world as a military officer and do-gooder who co-founded StandUp for Kids, a non-profit homeless-youth charity. But what, exactly, did he do?
            </p>
            <p>
             <strong>
              Last Friday, 71-year-old Koca was convicted on 22 counts of sexual assault on a child by a person in a position of trust.
             </strong>
             The trial was in Arapahoe County; Koca was arrested last September 15 on allegations that he'd repeatedly assaulted a boy under his supervision in Aurora, and that victim made a convincing witness at trial.
            </p>
            <p>
             As Deputy DA Cara Moran, who tried the case, said in a statement:..
            </p>
            <p>
             <em>
              'For more than three years, the victim kept silent regarding the repeated and ongoing sexual abuse he suffered at the hands of the defendant. The strength and courage this child demonstrated in not only coming forward and reporting the abuse, but in facing his abuser during trial is remarkable. He and his family placed their faith in the system to achieve justice and hold the Defendant responsible for his actions, and the verdict today is proof that justice has prevailed.'
             </em>
            </p>
            <p>
             Prior to his StandUp For Kids work, Koca spent thirty years in the military, where he was stationed in or visited a wide array of locations in the U.S., plus Panama, Venezuela, Italy and England. In this country, he was a Scout Master for a Boy Scouts of America program, and he volunteered in an orphanage while spending time in England. He was also part of Explorer scout programs in San Diego.
            </p>
            <p>
             So although Koca's arrest on September 15 came as a surprise -- the investigation had started just a month before -- the Aurora Police Department's announcement that it was looking for additional victims, given Koca's "extensive contact over the past several decades with persons under the age of eighteen through his work with several nonprofit organizations that primarily serve children," was not.
            </p>
            <p>
             StandUp For Kids, founded in 1990, sends outreach counselors into the street in an effort to assist homeless youth. Koca was on the board of the organization until two days after his arrest last September; at the time, the Atlanta-based StandUp for Kids had branches in 37 cities. Here's the story on the group's founding that was on the StandUp for Kids website last fall:
            </p>
            <p>
             <em>
              Mr. Koca is a retired naval officer. Rick joined the Navy at the age of 17, and during the next 30 years was promoted 13 times through 17 pay grades. A highly decorated naval officer, Rick was awarded the Defense Meritorious Service Medal, two Joint Service Commendation Medals, two Navy Commendation Medals, three Navy Achievement Medals, as well as numerous service awards and commendations.
             </em>
            </p>
            <p>
             <em>
              In 1990, with the help of several friends, STANDUP FOR KIDS outreach counselors began walking the streets touching base with the street kids. Now, more than twelve years later, STANDUP FOR KIDS has grown to more than twenty-eight programs in thirteen states.
             </em>
            </p>
            <p>
             <em>
              Now, after more than thirteen years of walking the streets, he can't think of a place that he would rather be. There have been many times when he just wanted to turn his back on it all. He thought it would help relieve the pain he was seeing in the kids on the streets. The pain of his first street kid who said he was HIV positive, the first 12-year-old living in a dumpster, his first youth heroin addict, a 13-year-old prostitute, the first baby living in a cave, and his first 17-year-old who died as a result of AIDS.
             </em>
            </p>
            <p>
             <em>
              Rick said, "this isn't about money, it's about caring!" "What we've accomplished has no price tag. We know we've made the difference in the lives of thousands of kids, I would have paid that price for one"!
             </em>
            </p>
            <p>
             <em>
              Now, this nationally acclaimed program has been recognized on three separate occasions by the White House, the U.S. Justice Department, American Express, the Governor's Office in Arizona twice, the Secretary of State of Colorado, and awarded the prestigious JCPenney Golden Rule Award. Rick has been awarded the George Washington Honor Award for his work with homeless and street kids; the Channel 10 Leadership Award, and was recognized as a finalist for the Edward A. Smith Award for Excellence in Nonprofit Leadership. Rick lives in San Diego and has 3 children and 7 grandchildren in Denver, Colorado.
             </em>
            </p>
            <p>
             Today you won't find any reference to Koca on the StandUp for Kids website, but you'll find plenty about Koca on the web.

           <blockquote>
            <p>
             Relativity Media is an American media company headquartered in Beverly Hills, California, founded in 2004 by Lynwood Spinks and Ryan Kavanaugh. The studio was the third largest mini-major globally until bankruptcy on July 30, 2015. Its full-scale film studio acquires, develops, produces and distributes films. The company's partners and financial institutions have invested $20 billion as of 2012 in entertainment investments with partners such as Citibank, Merrill Lynch, Deutsche Bank and others.
            </p>
            <p>
             On July 30, 2015, the company filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York after lawsuits and missing loan payments.[5][6][7][8] The company emerged from the bankruptcy in March 2016,[9] but in May 2018 it filed for bankruptcy once again.[10] The studio remains open for business and is now being operated by its new parent company UltraV Holdings.
            </p>
            <p>
             The studio was founded by Ryan Kavanaugh and Lynwood Spinks in 2004 as a middleman company arranging multi-film slate deals with studios then arranging financial support through banks. Relativity Media would receive film equity, producer's credit and a fee. Initially, Stark Investments, a Wisconsin-based hedge fund, funded the company's single-picture business. By 2007, these investors stopped making movie-finance deals. Elliott Management, a $16 billion New York–based hedge fund run by Paul Singer, then took a minority share of the company plus access to around $1 billion in capital and a revolving credit line.
            </p>
            <p>
             In 2010, Relativity Media ventured into India with the help of
             <strong>
              Asian billionaire Keyur Patel
             </strong>
             who also owns two major TV Networks and has major investments in India in satellite, theatre chain and media productions...
            </p>
            <p>
             On January 6, 2016, Relativity Media acquired Trigger Street Productions. Owners Kevin Spacey and Dana Brunetti were given the roles chairman and president of Relativity Studios, respectively.[35] That March, Spacey announced that he would not accept Relativity's offer; Brunetti's position is still in place.

             ..We welcomed 20 mentors to sail with us for stints as long as a month– from the Prince of Saudi Arabia, to the Archbishop Desmond Tutu, the founder of WordPress, and TIME Magazine Heroes.

              By the time he received his undergraduate degree in philosophy, he’d already started three companies. In 2012 he was recognized by Inc. Magazine as a “30 under 30 entrepreneur” and by Forbes as one of the “top 30 most impactful entrepreneurs” of the year.In 2013, he received the prestigious “Entrepreneur of the World” award along with Richard Branson &amp; the President of Liberia at the Global Entrepreneurship Forum. Today, this passion for entrepreneurship and startups has led to the creation of Unreasonable Group ( www.unreasonablegroup.com ). The vision of Unreasonable Group is to create a collective family of companies that will, together, put a dent on the seemingly intractable social and environmental challenges of this century.Daniel is proudly the founder of many Unreasonable companies including the Unreasonable Institute, Unreasonable Adventures, Unreasonable.is, Unreasonable at Sea, Unreasonable Capital, Unreasonable Media and the Girl Effect Accelerator. Daniel believes in militant transparency and truthfulness in his everyday life and in all of the projects he is part of. He also has an overt love for his hometown of Boulder Colorado and for his dog, Kaya.
