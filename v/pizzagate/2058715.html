            The majority of these so called "refugees" are fighting age men who are economic migrants not refugees, huge difference. In France they piss right beside the outdoor portable toilets and have absolutely no interest in making Europe a better place. This is happening all over, very few of these people are women and children refugees. They are Muslim men who want to uphold Islamic laws and want nothing to do with the western values or Christian type way of life. Many are on welfare and have no motivation of getting off it. This is the truth of how it really is out there and here.

            I think that Canada has a law that only married men and their families can have citizenship.  They acknowledge that it's the single men who cause havoc.

           <p>
            imho, mass migration is encouraged because it is the women and the children who can be trafficked, for both labour and sex.  However, it's the sex trafficking which is the most profitable.  These children are also easy pickings for those searching for prey for their ritual abuse.  These children can't be traced.  I've no doubt that many of the women who migrate end up being trafficked to first world countries and held in debt bondage by brothel owners, who keep them under control with drugs and rape,.

            I am completely baffled by the obtuseness on display here.
           </p>
           <ol>
            <li>
             Jewish organizations are the LOUDEST and BIGGEST supporters and even meet refugees and help them move onward
            </li>
            <li>
             Jews have an ethnostate with walls and have said they will not admit a single refugee
            </li>
            <li>
             Jews are the only ones who stand to gain by mixing eastern and western populations eventually resulting in large minority groups constantly at odds, Jews safely at the top in perpetuity
            </li>
           </ol>
           <p>
            But you think this is all in order to leave SCORES OF MILLIONS of women and children vulnerable to ultimately kidnap a 0.0001% of them.
           </p>
           <p>
            The refugees are YOUNG MEN because they are LOSERS and their families want them to fuck off to europe because at worst he gets citizenship and they can follow him there later.

            This isn't just happening in Europe.  I did a post on this happening very surreptitiously throughout the US under cover of night and how the women and children are separated from the men as revealed by whistleblower Jill Noble

            .  Also it appears that the EU is closing refugee camps and forcing them on to the streets.  An interesting article appeared yesterday on FB about the implications of this

            .   This is also not dissimilar from the crisis that abounded during the Balkans conflict which enabled Dyncorp to exploit the women and children refugees.  In addition, this week it has been revealed that the Mosul conflict has resulted in a high number of "orphans" being discovered (sorry I have no link to this).  War is big business all round, particularly it appears, with the increased access to vulnerable women and children.

            I think it's more than 2-for-1. There are multiple globalist groups playing in Europe. Right now their goals are somewhat aligned but that could change. The invasion is causing a few things:
           </p>
           <ul>
            <li>
             Some European Jews are being forced back to Israel
            </li>
            <li>
             The EU could get to use its army to keep dissenting member states in line (such as Hungary and Poland)
            </li>
            <li>
             The EU might get to use its army to 'protect' against Islamic aggression from within
            </li>
            <li>
             Soros and other destabilizers get conflict
            </li>
            <li>
             Child traffickers and organ harvesters get refugees and war zones
            </li>
            <li>
             Anti-Western groups get to see the European nations collapse
            </li>
            <li>
             Pro Muslim globalists obviously get territory
            </li>
           </ul>
           <p>
            Europe is a powder keg right now and it won't be long before the match is lit.

            Sweden is beyond help at this point. Same for Germany. It won't be 50 years until mass child rape will just be a normal part of life for these countries that allow mass Islamic immigration. Mudslimes are just about as bad as Jews. They do the same barbaric acts, but Jews have more intelligence and tact than the sand monkeys.

             Nobody wants to hear this, but the USA is in a worse situation, probably vastly so.  35+ million illegals in the USA.  7 million islamists, jews, hispanics and niggers.  Crime?  Yeah, there is mass child rape, probably to a worse degree.

            Now if you plan to enslave an entire planet what terms would you want to describe yourselves? What terms would be the most beneficial to elicit compliance?

            This is not to diss your post, just trying to bring awareness to it's the parasites, sub humans, satanist (some suggested terms) that promoted being called elite and Illuminati /trigger words that foster even more hopelessness bc they are the 'elite', the illumined ones.  See?

              Yes, I know about rule 1.  The 'shit eaters' want to be called lofty monikers and have no doubt they are the ones who put these into mass consciousness.
             </p>
             <p>
              Imho...we as the boots on the ground can change this by spreading awareness.  Just because it's in rule 1 it doesn't say you have to call them that...unfortunately it's just become so common/which is what the 'parasites' want.  I don't really want to give them what they want is all.

            In Sweden we call all "refugees/migrants" under the age of 40, children-refugees. When one point out the obvious fact that a 30 year old male refugee with a beard is not a child, one gets ostracized and called a racist. This is not a joke, it's called ideological subversion.
