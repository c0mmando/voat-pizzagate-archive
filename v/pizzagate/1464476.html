Baby I\'m preying on you tonight 
Hunt you down eat you alive 
Just like animals, animals Like animals-mals 
Maybe you think that you can hide I can smell your scent from miles 
Just like animals, animals Like animals-mals 
Baby I\'m  So what you trying to do to me 
It\'s like we can\'t stop, we\'re enemies 
But we get along when I\'m inside you 
You\'re like a drug that\'s killing me 
I cut you out entirely 
But I get so high when I\'m inside you<br />
Yeah you can start over, you can run free 
You can find other fish in the sea 
You can pretend it\'s meant to be 
But you can\'t stay away from me<br />
I can still hear you making that sound 
Taking me down rolling on the ground 
You can pretend that it was me but no

            Normally people interpret the the slang term "baby" as girlfriend, but read the lyrics literally to see another viewpoint as if Adam Levine is singing about being at one of Pedesta's parties.

            I was thinking about this song today:
           </p>
           <p>
            Elvis Costello Pills and Soap: (Talks about melting children down into pills and soap. ICKK!!)
           </p>
           <p>
            They talked to the sister, the father and the mother
With a microphone in one hand and a chequebook in the other
And the camera noses in to the tears on her face
The tears on her face
The tears on her face
You can put them back together with your paper and paste
But you can't put them back together
You can't put them back together
           </p>
           <p>
            Chorus:
What would you say?
What would you do?
Children and animals two by two
Give me the needle
Give me the rope
We're going to melt them down for pills and soap
           </p>
           <p>
            Four and twenty crowbars jemmy your desire
Out of the frying pan, into the fire
The king is in the counting house
Some folk have all the luck
And all we get is pictures of Lord and Lady Muck
They come from lovely people with a hard line in hypocrisy
There are ashtrays of emotion for the fag ends of the aristocracy
           </p>
           <p>
            (Chorus)
           </p>
           <p>
            Give me the needle
Give me the rope
           </p>
           <p>
            The sugar-coated pill is getting bitterer still
You think your country needs you, but you know it never will
So pack up your troubles in a stolen handbag
Don't dilly-dally boys, rally 'round the flag
Give us our daily bread in individual slices
And something in the daily rag to cancel any crisis
           </p>
           <p>
            (Chorus)
           </p>
           <p>
            Give me the needle, give me the rope
We're going to melt them down for pills and soap
           </p>
          </p>
