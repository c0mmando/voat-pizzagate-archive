            ZZZZZZZZZ. Weiner laptop. Nobody cares. This has gone on way too long. All the disinfo for last couple of years about NYPD about to release the info if FBI does not, constant BREAKING headlines in regards to this thread. Lets just stop with it for good? How bout, report when something actually happens and stop reporting what cannot be authenticated, at least in this case. We aren't just going to allow threads to repeat stuff about what is on the laptop over and over and over, about them being revealed over and over and over, and about an investigation that doesn't exist in the first place. If anything incriminating to the systems crime were on it, it would be covered up, not revealed. Lets not try to put people back to sleep and sell that the system is legit.

            This is proof that resident shill Are We Sure and his buddy KnightsOfHubris are liars. The Anthony Weiner Laptop really does have incriminating shit on it. Be sure to endlessly taunt them about it.

             And? If it does, they will not reveal it. So it will remain a mystery. The FBI gave the kidnapped Finders kids back to the Finders, at least that is my memory. Lets be big boys and stop this fantasy. There is no investigation. It's a cover-up. When you do a cover-up, you don't reveal, you suppress. Are we agreed on this part?

                But your ASSUMING just as much or EVEN MORE THAN anyone else here. Right before the crime against children it says Clinton foundation, Anthony weiners was well before that and that point was already finished. Why would he say Anthony weiner, then mention a crime against a child, then move on and say Clinton foundation, then go back and reiterate with an additional note crime against children? That makes no fucking sense. You're stretching even further while telling others they're stretching. This is where you're are we sure name is exposed as a fraud, because you're not sure..... You're grasping even harder than others are. There's a natural flow to the notes, and right before this is Clinton foundation. WHY? when you're taking notes why would you move on from weiner to his crime against a child on to the Clinton foundation then back to point 2 that you already wrote in detail? Dude it doesn't make sense so go ahead and pretzel some more.

                 No. I'm not assuming anything.  I'm basing this on the fact that Athony Weiner plead guility to a crime involving a single girl and and after reviewing these emails, the FBI closed the Clinton case again.  People who are clinging to the Weiner laptop will put Hillary Clinton in jail are not evern grasping at straws, they are grasping at the dust the straws have turned into since they first grasped at straws.

                <p>
                 There is nothing in the IG Report that supporters the pizzagaters claims.  Zero.
                </p>
                <p>
                 In fact you should read the entire chapter on this.  This nitpicking over a quickly written note that has a completely plausible other explanation is an incredibly slender reed to base a claim on.  There's no way to read that full chapter and think the Weiner-laptop-hoax story stands up.  For one, it's mentioned over and over and over again, that the FBI does not have a warrant to look at the Clinton material and thus are not looking at that material until they get one.  At the time the note was written they were not looking and Clinton's email and in fact they guidance they were given was not even to look at emails between Weiner and his wife.....sexting with his wife would not be a crime.  Only emails between Weiner and other people were to be reviewed.

                 This a complete assumption here.   These are quick notes not a detailed write up.  It's far fetched to think that point was already finished.  Notes are created with chronologically....you write notes as the information is said.....later on you put it full order and add details. (Actually one of the things I do for a living is writing up clear notes that make sure all important agreements are understood by everyone who was there.)  And the evidence leans towards your assumption being a false assumption.  Because wrote down 3 numbered points with details under #3   #1 is Athony Weiner and #3 is details about the Weiner case.  So no, the Weiner thing was not done.

                  I'm not assuming anything. I just think we should be sure, and not close the case without investigating every angle. But what's very telling is, you're ignoring that the FBI lied about every single point they made when closing the case. And that if the job is done correctly now it will be reopened. They literally came on the air. And admitted Clinton was guilty of several things and then said no charges will be filed. That certainly doesn't help your explanation at all. So you're saying that they even lied internally? It just doesn't make any sense and certainly not enough sense to claim that you're sure.

                   They told the truth and you simply don't like what the truth is.   And the IG report now confirms this.  No one has ever been charged with a crime for doing the things Clinton did.   The IG report discussed this in detail and concludes it was the proper decision.

                   The stuff Clinton did is usually handled within the agency, not prosecuting as a crime.

               Crime by itself can be a plural actually.. for instance a wave of crime has hit the city.. we found evidence of crime.
              </p>
              <p>
               Plural of crime when used as a noun? Sure that's crimes.
              </p>
              <p>
               But crime is also used as a verb as it is in this case.
              </p>
              <p>
               For instance
              </p>
              <p>
               Crime doesn't pay. This is a verb and is speaking of multiple crimes.
              </p>
              <p>
               Crime against children comes of as the verb version of the word. You wouldnt say crimes doesn't pay, or crimes don't pay. You say crime doesn't pay.
              </p>
              <p>
               So if he meant it as a verb then crime against children can be multiple crimes. Rather than as a noun, a single crime against children.
              </p>
              <p>
               The giveaway is this....
              </p>
              <p>
               If it's a single child and a single crime, he would say. Crime against a child. But he uses the word children. Which immediately makes it a plural since there and more than one child it's more than one crime.
              </p>
              <p>
               So clearly he meant it as a verb, crime against children, and act of multiple crimes.
              </p>
              <p>
               Otherwise a single noun used against a plural children really doesn't make sense.
              </p>
              <p>
               And yes I'm sure.

                 Well thanks for proving my point. That crime is a plural. It doesn't matter because the notes say CRIME. Not CRIMES. and really you're agruing against your own point. Ahahhaaa

                 What's dumber is you make the claim that the report makes it clear. So you use the utmost of skepticism on anything else and then the utmost of liberal on this one point. That shows you have an agenda and it's the opposite of being sure. Being sure means you pursue every lead until it's proven otherwise. Your agenda is the opposite. Ignore every lead unless it's proven. The ig report does not make that clear the only thing being made clear is just how much of a shill you are. You're not sure about anything. And you don't care to be sure. You immediately find any way you can discredit anything no matter if its even less likely or no more likely than what people are looking at. Dude that's definitely not being sure. It's being sure to shill the fuck out. clearly you're being paid, nobody would waste their time this much... Discussing with people who have time and time again exposed you as a shill unless they were getting paid or just plain stupid. Which I think you have proven you're not stupid, so clearly you have an agenda to protect the truth from being exposed. I mean really worst case for the people on here being wrong? Their wrong and they wasted time. Worst case for you being wrong? You prolonged the torture and murder and rape of innocent children and worked day and night against their rescue.
                </p>
                <p>
                 So dude go get your paycheck and take a night off and celebrate your master shilling. Fuck man tell me where to send 20 bucks and I'll pay for your shill ass dinner, because you're definitely not doing this for the children...

                  I said this was true-ish.   It's not a plural noun, it's a collective noun.  Collective nouns take the singular verb.

                  No. Um when I get new facts, I update my arguments.  And this argument does not undermine my point.  The IG report is quite clear that these are two separate investigations requiring two separate warrants.  Nothing about the warrant against Clinton invovled sex crimes.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  Read the full chapter 9 of the report and there's no honest way to believe that the IG report supports the clinton-sex-crime-evidence-on-Weiner's-laptop-hoax.  It's impossible.

              When I listened to Eric Prince's interview it sounded 100% legit. I believe it was PG that got Trump elected and now these pedo/psychopaths are scattering around like cocroaches (no disrespect to the noble insect - by comparison) in shining light.

            In Context:
(Note: Comey was only "dimly" aware of Weiner Child Exploitation charge...also Comey has claimed not to know Huma was Weiner's wife...uh huh)
Coleman’s memorandum stated that Baker planned to look into the issue further.
We asked Baker about that and he stated he did not recall specifics, but he believed
he asked “somebody on the Midyear team” about the issue.
In the Coleman memorandum’s next and final paragraph, which is undated,
it stated, “It was determined by DD McCabe and EAD Steinbach that any follow on
investigative activity concerning the emails located on Anthony Weiner’s laptop
would be reviewed by the MIDYEAR investigative team.” Coleman said he did not
recall why this entry was undated and was unsure at what point this occurred. He
told us that he shared an office with Steinbach and that this could have been a
dialogue between himself and Steinbach at some point later in October.
2. Email from Bowdich to Comey on October 3
On October 3, at 7:42 p.m., Bowdich sent an email to Comey and McCabe
briefing them on items of interest from that day. Rybicki was cc’d on the email,
which was entitled “Daily Report.” After highlighting three unrelated items,
Bowdich stated, “I asked Randy Coleman to stay behind tomorrow to quickly brief
you on the Weiner matter which is growing more complicated, but it can wait until
then.” Bowdich told the OIG that he did not remember what was “growing more
complicated” with the Weiner matter. Bowdich noted that when dealing with issues
of this type he typically “would have pushed that up to Andy, and/or the Director,
and Baker would have been right in the middle of it.”
Comey told us he did not recall this email and also did not recall what was
“growing more complicated” in the Weiner matter. Comey stated that he was “only
dimly” aware of the Weiner child exploitation investigation at this point in time.
We also asked Rybicki about this email. Rybicki stated that he did not know
what was meant by “the Weiner matter which is growing more complicated.”
Rybicki told us that he first recalled hearing about the issue of Clinton emails on the
Weiner laptop on October “26th into the 27th.” When asked if this email made
Rybicki think that he and Comey were aware of the Weiner laptop issue earlier than
he recalled, Rybicki responded, “I don’t think so.... I remember on the 27th right
when I heard about it thinking this is [unintelligible]. That would, that’s my first
recollection as well of hearing anything about it.”
3. Meeting between Comey and Coleman on October 4
Comey’s Outlook calendar for October 4 contains an entry for “Morning
Briefs” from 8:15 a.m. to 9:00 a.m. that is immediately followed by an entry for
“Meeting w/EAD Coleman” from 9:00 a.m. to 9:30 a.m. Coleman told us that he
could not recall this briefing with Comey. Coleman stated that staying behind to
brief Comey would be consistent with normal practice, but added that he did not
recall this specific instance. Coleman told us that it would be unusual to have a
one-on-one meeting with Comey and told us someone else would typically be
present at these briefings, such as the DD or ADD. While not remembering this
meeting, Coleman speculated that this may have been a one-on-one meeting with
Comey to discuss Coleman’s upcoming retirement from the FBI in December 2016.
294
Coleman told us that he kept regularly took notes in a journal. Coleman’s
notes from October 4 contained the following entry:
(1) Anthony Wiener [sic]
(2) [Unrelated]
(3) Wiener [sic] – texting 15 yo – Sexually Explicit
9/26 – Federal SW – IPhone/IPAD/Laptop
Initial analysis of laptop – thousands emails
Hillary Clinton &amp; Foundation
Crime Against Children
We asked Coleman about these notes and he told us that, given their placement in
his notebook, the notes would most likely represent information he was briefed on
first thing in the morning by his subordinates in the Criminal Investigative Division.
Coleman stated that he may have passed this information to other FBI executives
after the morning briefing with the Director, but he could not remember if that
occurred here.
Comey told us that he did not recall the briefing by Coleman reflected in his
calendar. We asked Comey if this briefing could have been the time in early
October that he recalled being told about the connection between Midyear and the
Weiner investigation. Comey stated:
It’s possible, possible this is what is knocking around in the back of my
head, but I really, see I know the frailty of memory from having done
a lot of this work, at least in my memory it’s much more of an informal
than a meeting about it, but it’s possible.
We showed Coleman’s notes from October 4 to Comey. Comey did not recall being
briefed on the information contained in the notes. When asked about Coleman,
Comey said he “thought very higghly of him” and described him as a “straight
shooter.”
We asked Comey if this information was something that he likely would have
“put out of his mind” after being informed of it in early October. Comey responded,
“I don’t think so unless, unless the way it was passed to me was with some, you
don’t need to do anything. We’re doing, we’re running it down or something.
Something that pushed it down on my priority list.”
