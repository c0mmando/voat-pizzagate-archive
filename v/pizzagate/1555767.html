            While researching all of this for 14 yrs now, I have learned that most agencies that protect children and combat these types of criminal activity, they also are there to protect the higher-ups, the untouchables. This is now how the U.S. accumulates black money for ops. Sick....we are.

              which sources a Icelandic Red Cross report 59 to 128 cases of trafficking has been noted between 2006-2009. To put that into perspective Iceland only has around 320.000 Inhabitants.

              Italy - WOW, I outlined the borders and just the entire country seems so be PACKED with trafficking - surrounding areas (balkan) show heat as well, but the yellow intensity seems to line up with the borders. the area of Turin/Milan in the top left seems the hotbed, as well as Rome/the Vatican in the middle. Guess there have been links established between Italy &amp; pedo (Vatican &amp; Berlusconi) &amp; the odd

            "On Dec. 28, 2016, President Barack Obama published the annual proclamation of January as National Slavery and Human Trafficking Prevention Month, and the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency is developing next-generation search technologies to help investigators find the online perpetrators of those crimes."
           </p>
           <p>
            "the program, called Memex, is designed to help law enforcement officers and others perform online investigations to hunt down human traffickers." link to memex site
            <a href="http://archive.is/1VoqW">
             http://archive.is/1VoqW

           <p>
            “Our goal is to understand the footprint of human trafficking in online spaces, whether that be the dark web or the open web,”
           </p>
           <p>
            “Victims of sex trafficking are often sold as prostitutes online, and a number of websites are the advertising point where people who want to buy and people who are selling can exchange information, or make deals. “ That's What we're looking for,”
           </p>
           <p>
            “If we could do that,” he said, “we could … generate leads for investigators so they wouldn’t have to sift through millions of ads in order to find the small number of ads that are associated with trafficking. So that's what we did.”
           </p>
           <p>
            “Since the beginning of the program, we've had a strong relationship with the district attorney of New York, but they're not the only user of the technology. Over time, we have engaged with many different law enforcement agencies, including 26 in the United Kingdom, the district attorney of San Francisco, and a number of others,”
           </p>
           <p>
            “there have been hundreds of arrests and other convictions by a variety of law enforcement agencies in the United States and abroad.”
            <em>

           </p>
           <p>
            “we have hundreds of people who are working on this effort. All of them are very dedicated to this problem, because the problem of human trafficking is real.”
           </p>
           <p>
            When Shen’s team started the program, one of the things they realized was that the cost of people in these spaces, the cost of slaves, is essentially zero, he added.
           </p>
           <p>
            “That means our lives are essentially worthless in some sense, and that just seems wrong,”

            If organizations like DARPA (and there are many) fail to weigh in, heavily, on Pizzagate and very soon, it will be obvious that they are actually working for the other side. They need to be petitioned for statements.

             I am hoping for the best but after being on reddit since the beginning of Pizzagate and moving over to voat I know that the elites can not be trusted.  How convenient for BO to create the Agency and Darpa during this hotbed of accusations by the CIA and the continued explosion of Pizzagate on the internet.  Here we go with the Nothing To See Here Move Along Act.
