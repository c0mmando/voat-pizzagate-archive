<p>Obama and Bush have spent time in St. Lucie county Florida. Obama visited several times to play golf. I am sure everyone has heard about the big bear hug, he recieved by Scott Van Duzer owner of Big apple pizza.</p>

<p>There is a pedo swirl logo on the wall of the Pizzeria <a href="https://ibb.co/mh4SOw">https://ibb.co/mh4SOw</a>

<p>Seems a little out there, but the apple part of the logo looks like male genitalia, to me.

<p>Van Duzer throws many fundraisers for disabled children.   Everytime he does he asks for a blood donation. <a href="http://archive.is/UXKMD">http://archive.is/UXKMD</a></p>

<p>&quot;Remember the racism
which took away our homes
and our livelihood
and which sought
to steal away our humanity.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Remember also our will to live,
to hold fast to that
which marks us as human beings:
our generosity, our love of justice
and our care for each other.&quot;</p>

<p>Van Duzer\'s phone numbers led me to a 3rd business called &quot;FC Edge&quot; with 2 locations, one of them is located right next door to &quot;Kids hope&quot;  and guess what? Another Pedo logo.</p>
<p><a href="https://ibb.co/d7CaRG">https://ibb.co/d7CaRG</a></p>
<p>F C Edges states, they have made 2 million last year as an advertising company. Although they\'re using Van Duzers phone number and are definitely connected, the business is registered to someone else. 772-221-0234</p>

<p>Why would a sheriff officer be at Big apple pizzeria @ 3am watching Van Duzer  prepare for a pizza contest?

<p>Look close at the smiley face on this one.
<a href="https://ibb.co/jEuekb">https://ibb.co/jEuekb</a></p>
<p>In this article I see the repetition of 6\'s, and Van duzer states  &quot;packed protein with his pepperoni pizza&quot; also mentions pulling his &quot;achilles&quot; and maybe I am over thinking the meanings, pizzagate has opened my eyes to so much. Then he goes on to  make comments about protesters outside his business. This sounds like the same old Soros propaganda that we see over and over.</p>

<p>Fort pierce has a reputation for false flags.
The Orlando shooting (Obama was in Fort Pierce, which was the home of the shooter  the week before).</p>
<p>The mosque he attended is basically right next to the Sheriffs department, 3 different sets of terror attackers attended there. </p>
<p>The mosque has connections to CIAR. </p>
<p>This is the same mosque that was set on fire.

<p>Then the FBI mishap with the Orlando shooter, 
<a href="http://m.huffpost.com/us/entry/10481948">http://m.huffpost.com/us/entry/10481948</a></p>
<p>The sherriffs department under Obama were combined with the US Marshalls. They\'re now militarized, tanks and all. I just
have a really bad feeling going through this, the tenticles are spread everywhere.</p>

<p>Just some observation notes: </p>
<p>Van Duzers Big Apple Pizza is located right across the street from Indian State college, which also houses the county morgue. <a href="https://ibb.co/mD84Lb">https://ibb.co/mD84Lb</a></p>
<p>So many youth are murdered in this neighborhood it\'s one of the worst cities in the country. They have pushed the drug addicts and gangsters to one section of the county, and the sherriffs office basically sits in neighborhood arresting them.  CPS cases are high, they use an outside company to do thier dirty work. <a href="http://www.devereux.org/site/PageServer?pagename=fl_case_management">http://www.devereux.org/site/PageServer?pagename=fl_case_management</a></p>
<p>Just some things I observed:</p>
<p>There is a walmart distribution center in between Van Dousers businesses.  
</p>
<p><a href="https://m.facebook.com/pages/Wal-Mart-DC-7038/134142706632525">https://m.facebook.com/pages/Wal-Mart-DC-7038/134142706632525</a></p>
<p>And 3 major Truckstops located next to the only highway in the area running East to West. </p>
<p>While browsing the neighborhood in between Van Duzers businesses. l  found a 2nd swirl. I couldn\'t find a relation between them just yet. It\'s a hair salon that gives massages. I just know there is no way the sherriff office isn\'t aware as it is right down the street from them. <a href="https://ibb.co/mxp5Ab">https://ibb.co/mxp5Ab</a></p>',

           In this article I see the repetition of 6's, and Van duzer states  "packed protein with his pepperoni pizza" also mentions pulling his "achilles" and maybe I am over thinking the meanings, pizzagate has opened my eyes to so much. Then he goes on to  make comments about protesters outside his business. This sounds like the same old Soros propaganda that we see over and over.

           Fort pierce has a reputation for false flags.
The Orlando shooting (Obama was in Fort Pierce, which was the home of the shooter  the week before).
          </p>
          <p>
           The mosque he attended is basically right next to the Sheriffs department, 3 different sets of terror attackers attended there.
          </p>
          <p>
           The mosque has connections to CIAR.
          </p>
          <p>
           This is the same mosque that was set on fire.

           The sherriffs department under Obama were combined with the US Marshalls. They're now militarized, tanks and all. I just
have a really bad feeling going through this, the tenticles are spread everywhere.

           Just some observation notes:
          </p>
          <p>
           Van Duzers Big Apple Pizza is located right across the street from Indian State college, which also houses the county morgue.

          <p>
           So many youth are murdered in this neighborhood it's one of the worst cities in the country. They have pushed the drug addicts and gangsters to one section of the county, and the sherriffs office basically sits in neighborhood arresting them.  CPS cases are high, they use an outside company to do thier dirty work.

           </a>
          </p>
          <p>
           Just some things I observed:
          </p>
          <p>
           There is a walmart distribution center in between Van Dousers businesses.
          </p>
          <p>
           <a href="https://m.facebook.com/pages/Wal-Mart-DC-7038/134142706632525">

           </a>
          </p>
          <p>
           And 3 major Truckstops located next to the only highway in the area running East to West.
          </p>
          <p>
           While browsing the neighborhood in between Van Duzers businesses. l  found a 2nd swirl. I couldn't find a relation between them just yet. It's a hair salon that gives massages. I just know there is no way the sherriff office isn't aware as it is right down the street from them.

            This legend isn’t that old. On January 8, 1971, before Hammock Park was built, a serial killer (sometimes known as the Killer Deputy) Gerard John Schaefer captured two young girls while they were hitchhiking. Schaefer bound, gagged, raped, hanged, then buried 19 year olds Collette Goodenough, and Barbara Ann Wilcox at the Devil’s Tree. The crazed killer was said to have returned on several occasions to have his way with the decomposing bodies.

            I saw a quick clip tonight of Obama in England today at some Games associated with Prince Harry.  Obama was sitting between Prince Harry and Joe and Jill Biden, (no Michelle in sight) and he looked paranoid as all get out.

             If you have a 4 chan account please share for me. This a big deal, I think this is the type of neighborhood they can easily recruit people for NWO or pull it. Everything Soros and Clinton Foundation was doing to the poor, in other countries, most likely takes place in Fort Pierce.

             Fort Pierce's new Boy Scout Troop 772 is getting some help from the St. Lucie County Sheriff's Office, according to Sheriff Ken J. Mascara.  The Sheriff's Office has donated 30 bicycles to the Boy Scouts, and a non-profit organization affiliated with the Sheriff's Office is donating $1,500 toward the purchase of a used Council on Aging bus for the troop, Sheriff Mascara said.  "Scouting embodies values that are important to our community," Sheriff Mascara said. "Since businessman Scott Van Duzer and others in the community worked to establish Troop 772 in Fort Pierce, I have supported this effort to give the youth of Fort Pierce the benefits of the scouting experience."  Throughout the year, the Sheriff's Office collects used bicycles donated by people in the community. A carefully supervised work crew of jail inmates fixes the bicycles for donation to needy children in our community at Christmas, Sheriff Mascara said.  "I thought the timely donation of 30 bikes to Troop 772 was the right thing to do," Sheriff Mascara said. The Sheriff's Office brought 30 bikes to the Boy Scouts Thursday, delivering them to Scott Van Duzer's business, Big Apple Pizza, at 2311 South 35th Street, Fort Pierce.  Also, the St. Lucie County Crime Prevention League, a charitable non-profit group affiliated with the St. Lucie County Sheriff's Office, is donating $1,500 to help Trooper 772 purchase a used bus from the St. Lucie County Council on Aging. The total price will be $3,000, with the St. Lucie County Crime Prevention League donating half the money.  "I want to invite our community to strongly support Boy Scout Troop 772 to make this a better community," Sheriff Mascara said. To learn more about Boy Scout Troop 772 or to get involved, people may call 772-528-3467.

            Do you have proof of that? I know Mateen's father was at HRC rally right after and was also in the State Department.

              Thanks..For those that don't know Omar Mateen actually worked for a government contracted company that does security, prowler teams, and other unmentionable things. They are part of the standing army we now have in the US which could be mobilized by the FEDs....it needs to be uprooted out of our country

              Great research! I noticed that in the article about the Sheriff/Boy Scouts the number 772 is mentioned 6 times. 7+7+2=16; 1+6=7. Also the address 2311 also equals 7 when added up
