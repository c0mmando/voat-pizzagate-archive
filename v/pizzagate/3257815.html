<p>I hope this has legs and that it tarnishes his version of things, but I feel this issue has been so normalized that people won\'t care.

. 
In the grand web of the Mueller investigation, Lebanese-American businessman George Nader enters at a key point off the coast of East Africa. An adviser to Emirati crown prince Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan, Nader reportedly brokered a meeting in the Seychelles between a Russian surrogate close to Putin and Blackwater founder Erik Prince, who has denied that he represented the Trump administration in any capacity.
According to Nader’s testimony in the Mueller report, that claim is dubious at best: Prince once told lawmakers he didn’t “fly there to meet any Russian guy,” but Nader told the special counsel he informed Prince that Russia was “looking to build a link with the incoming Trump administration.” The businessman, long considered a liaison between Washington and Middle Eastern officials, was a major source of information for the special counsel: The redacted Mueller report released in April refers to Nader in almost four dozen footnotes.</p>
<p>Nader provided testimony on the alleged attempt to establish a back channel between Trump and Moscow in exchange for immunity on any related charges. But on Monday, Nader was arrested on child-pornography charges in New York when he arrived at JFK airport. Justice Department officials state that Nader was originally charged in January 2018, when he arrived in Washington, D.C., from Dubai with a phone containing pictures of minors engaging in sexual conduct.</p>
<p>An affidavit unsealed on Monday asserts that a search warrant approved for a “matter unrelated to child pornography” allowed federal agents to search items on Nader. Upon his arrival in D.C. in January 2018, the FBI interviewed him on “a matter unrelated to child pornography,” after which Nader was told of the warrant. Three of his phones were seized, and an agent found “multiple files” of child pornography, at which point a second search warrant was issued to search for similar files. According to the affidavit, 12 sexually explicit videos of minors were found on Nader’s phones. If convicted, the 60-year-old faces a minimum sentence of 15 years and a maximum of 40 years.</p>
<p>This is not a new legal issue for Nader: The businessman has faced charges of child pornography or underage sexual abuse every decade since the 1980s. In 1991, he served a six-month sentence after pleading guilty to the same charge after he flew from Germany to D.C. with two sexually explicit videotapes of 13- or 14-year-old boys. In 1985, he faced a similar charge for importing from the Netherlands magazines with depictions of naked children, a charge that was dismissed after a judge ruled the search warrant for Nader’s home was invalid. In 2003, he was convicted in the Czech Republic of sexually abusing 10 boys between 1999 and 2002, for which he served one year in prison.</p>

              I'm the one who made the comment "The George Nader mentioned in the OP's article is probably this pedo"
             </p>
             <p>
              (I recycle my accounts regularly for security reasons, and my then handle was converted to a number when I deactivated the previous account - I'm morally opposed to operating with alt accounts).
             </p>
             <p>
              Anyway, the name George Nader had just shown up in the news that same morning, and I instinctively googled for "George Nader pedo" and voila!

             I don't remember that post, but I do remember the story circulation. This brings it full cycle, but the disinfo specialists are all over it. Now a fake story is going around that the Nader that Clinton spent time with is a different Nader from the pedo king who visited Epstein Island. I really don't see any way out of this mess. Not unless arrests are made, but it's taking so long. Even the FISA warrants haven't been released. What was it? Two weeks ago that our POTUS ordered Barr to release them to the public after he'd redacted whatever info we didn't need to know? Yeah, you see any FISA's?
            </p>
            <p>
             Yeah, I don't either.

            Is there child trafficking involving an orphanage in the Dominican Republic that is sponsored by a nearby elite resort owned by friends of the Clintons?

            Even Casa de Campo, the region’s most upscale resort, hasn’t been spared, with posh villas often used to plan criminal operations, some even for tortures.

            Not surprising.  Mueller was responsible for having the Franklin Case scuttled.  I posted it quite a while but can't find it anymore.  Scrubbed.  Birds of a feather. If  find it, I will post it.

              I wish to God I could find that  I posted it at some point.  Not good at the tech stuff and saving things.  Some day if I have more time I might try to look again.  I was amazed actually to find it.

                I hope so.  He is another one that really has been flying under the radar.  The whole Mueller Investigation was and is a Fiasco.  He needs to be thrown in jail.

                 But the Linda Collins-Smith case has me wondering. I mean, if Sessions really was doing all that investigation ... and appointed Huber who has done an massive amount of work, could it be that Mueller really is working with Trump? It would be crazy, but why would she go on a Youtube channel that believed that?
                </p>
                <p>
                 I'll have to think this through again.

                  With all that Mueller has done wrong, all his shady profitable deals and coverups, I doubt he is trying to do any good for anyone else but himself.  Even if he has decided to turn over a new leaf for just this time, well, his past speaks volumes of his character.  Unless of course he has been blackmailed.

                   Oh, I hear you. I really do. I'm on the same page ... or was.

                  <p>
                   But I thought Sessions was a waste. I couldn't imagine where anyone would think he'd done anything, and KERPOW! Out of the blue, I find those links and the current Clinton Foundation investigation HINGED ON HIM! Without him, this would be an undergoing investigation. That's all I'm trying to say. Is that I had no intention of changing my mind about Sessions and look what happened? And if Mueller were working with Trump, he had better be convincing that he isn't! Otherwise, he'd probably end up just like Collins-Smith and Schaefer. And the dems did hinge their hopes on himj that he failed to deliver.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   So I hear you, I understand, and I thought Mueller was scum. I might still decide to stick with that, but right now? I don't know what to think. I honestly don't.

            He also spent time in jail in Czechia for sexually exploiting underage boys.

            He paid an (Israeli IIRC) company for launching a social media campaign to support Trump during the election campaign.

           <p>
            Until he got arrested now, he was employed by Trump supporter and major GOP donor Erik Prince as a consultant. Who knew perfectly well that he was convicted for child rape.

             But as the second link shows, he was a crucial guy to have around. If he could arrange a meeting on a yacht proposing a new coalition, he might have been hired for other reasons than being a scumbag. I'm not saying pedos should be hired, but there were no outstanding charges and he was a key figure in communicating with Middle Eastern leaders. It's why I'm reserving judgement on why he was around and/or hired until more details emerge about what else Erick Prince was doing and what his motives were.

              Yep, that's the excuse people always come up with when they try to defend why someone employs pedos.
             </p>
             <p>
              You could justfiy with the same excuse that the Dems were connected to Tony Podesta.
             </p>
             <p>
              When you're a decent person, you just don't give money and jobs to convicted pedo.
             </p>
             <p>
              Not the only pedo Prince seems to have employed btw.

              He also teamed up with DynCorp.

               Podesta is a different case. There's a huge difference between ''hiring'' someone, and ''partying'' with this person.
              </p>
              <p>
               That's the line of demarcation for me. There are and will continue to be not-so-nice guys hired to perform tasks, but the question is do they fraternize with them.

            Those Arab leaders did not back Hillary, they backed Trump.  Here's the part you missed.
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             How Trump was key to plans
.....Trump had only announced his candidacy months before in June 2015 when the Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton was leading in all the polls. She was thought by the Saudis and Emiratis to be more likely to ring fence the nuclear deal Barack Obama made with Iran, and to be generally more sceptical of their plans for a push back in the region.
            </p>
            <p>
             Significantly, these Arab leaders decided in late 2015 that a wildcard presidential candidate in the shape of Trump could be the key to their plans to become the new regional hegemons.
            </p>
           </blockquote>
           <p>
            Couple of other points to show how these folks supported Trump.
           </p>
           <p>
            The NY Times just had an article that the most powerful Arab leader is the head of the UAE not Saudi Arabia -Mohammed bin Zayed.  Nader was MBZ's man.
           </p>
           <p>
            A.  MBZ secretly came to America and met with team Trump.
           </p>
           <p>
            B.
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             In August 2016, Nader met with Donald Trump Jr. at Trump Tower offering assistance to his father's presidential campaign. Nader served as an envoy representing Saudi Arabia's Crown Prince and de facto ruler Mohammad bin Salman and Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan, the Crown Prince of the Emirate of Abu Dhabi. The meeting included Blackwater founder Erik Prince again and Joel Zamel, an Israeli specialist in social media manipulation. -from Wiki

           <p>
            C.
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             Nader attended a December 2016 meeting in New York between the United Arab Emirates (UAE) officials and president-elect Donald Trump's associates Jared Kushner, Michael Flynn, and Steve Bannon.

           <blockquote>
            <p>
             In January 2017 he was at a meeting on the Seychelles islands between the Emiratis and Erik Prince, and was present when Prince met with officials from the UAE and Kirill Dmitriev, head of state-run Russian Direct Investment Fund.
            </p>
           </blockquote>
           <p>
            Erik Prince was representing team trump at that meeting.
           </p>
           <p>
            Nader also worked with Eliot Broidy, the convicted felon that Trump installed on the Republican National Committee finance team.
           </p>
           <p>
            Nader was working very, very closely with Team Trump.

              Nader also worked with Eliot Broidy, the convicted felon that Trump installed on the Republican National Committee finance team.

              Nader was working very, very closely with Team Trump.

             No, he wasn't, and I haven't missed anything.
            </p>
            <p>
             Prince and The Trump team have continually denied that he represented them in any way, shape, or form. There is no proof other than his sworn statement to Mueller who we know is a liar himself. As I stated in the OP, I doubt whether this child-pornography charge will do much good in discrediting Nader. And there you go proving my worst fears true. Even with the latest charge that could land Nader in jail for 40 years, it's not tarnishing his word that was only his word without any proof to back it up. And, yet, Mueller singled him out to be star witness:

            <p>
             Why? For the same reason Steele was singled out to create a fake dossier: because both would say or do anything they were paid to do.
            </p>
            <p>
             I'm extremely disheartened that people overlook such evidence when trying to ascertain the truthfulness of an individual. We've seen it in the Kavanaugh witch hunt and in this Mueller one. So go ahead and believe what you like. There's no convincing you. But I hope it does red-pill those that wish to take their blinders off.

               Tons of people passed this around and wrote up blogs and comments, and steemits on it, but they were all wrong. A lot of them didn't care that they wrong like the True Pundit site cited on that steemit page. True Pundit lies to his audience all the time.

               The  guy you are claiming is Tony Podesta (have you had your glasses checked?) is Jose Calzada, a real estate executive in the Domincan Republic.
