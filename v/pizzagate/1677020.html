<p>Ashton Kutcher has made some statements that are consistent with the behaviour I would expect of an  individual that sincerely wishes to raise public awareness about child sex trafficking, and are inconsistent with the behaviour of an individual attempting to divert public attention from this problem. However, Mr.  Kutcher has made other statements that seem to point in the opposite direction. This makes it difficult to arrive at any firm conclusions.</p>

<li>
<p>In April 2011, Kutcher and then-wife Demi Moore began a public service announcement campaign to end child sex trafficking. <sup>[<a href="http://www.cnn.com/2011/WORLD/americas/04/14/kutcher.moore.piers.morgan/index.html">&quot;Moore, Kutcher: Join our crusade to end child sex trafficking&quot;</a>.

</li>
<li>
<p>Kutcher said that 100,000 to 300,000 American children were sold into sexual slavery. For some reason, this very conservative figure was considered offensive by the Jewish  newspaper &quot;Village Voice&quot; which responded to Kutcher with the absurd claim that only a couple of hundred child prostitutes exist in all of America. <sup>[<a href="www.villagevoice.com/news/real-men-get-their-facts-straight-6431644">&quot;Real Men Get Their Facts Straight&quot;</a>.

</li>

<p>Kutcher claimed the Village Voice promoted child prostitution and used Twitter to request that Village Voice advertisers withdraw their advertising from publications owned by its parent company. <sup>[<a href="gawker.com/5817554/ashton-kutcher-will-destroy-newspaper-over-sex-slavery-article">&quot;Ashton Kutcher Will Destroy Newspaper Over Sex Slavery Article&quot;</a>.

<p>Kutcher comes from a &quot;relatively conservative&quot; working-class Catholic family of Irish, German, and Czech heritage. Kutcher describes himself as a fiscal conservative and social liberal. <sup>[&quot;Ashton Kutcher&quot;, Wikipedia.]</sup></p>

I am not saying that any of these things are good or bad, or necessarily reflect on Ashton Kutcher. Make of them what you will.)</p>

<p>In 2013, Kutcher remarked, &quot;Israel is near and dear to my heart... coming to Israel is sort of coming back to the source of creation – trying to get closer to that.

            This place has lost all its credibility. People saying their intuition leads them to think Ashton Kutcher is bad? How about your petty bad looks and unsuccessful life leading you to judge him?

            I think tonight I'm officially done with this site. I'm all in on the human trafficking/pizzagate investigation, dissolving the corrupt CIA, prosecuting HRC and the CF, draining the swamp, holding elites to account etc,  but I read these ridiculous comments about Ashton Kutsher and Bill Maher and making correlations where there shouldn't be any and it's getting  ridiculous, people are not able to place credit where credit is due, continue to filter this through a bipartisan lens, which is counterproductive, and see the bogeyman everywhere. Now Demi Moore is a pedo?? REALLY?? The site unfortunately has completely devolved.

            tell all of us how wrong we really are. Tell us about your good ole Freemason fuck and his interest in "Judaism" and his innocence. I would love to hear more! Don't be shy now. Plenty of opportunity for you to show us the great intentions of satanic Freemasonry. =D

            I wonder if ashtons "successful" tech investing was somewhat less based on his individual acumen and possibly due to being the investor front for the deep state (for example deep state gets a backdoor for data and invades privacy, ashton and the company get deep state backing to make sure their app is more successful than the competition). Anyone revisited this since pizzagate or more knowledgable about ashton's silicon valley / tech venture capital ties?

            I know, since Ashton Kutcher's recent talk before congress, he's been of interest. Are any of the items, OP, that you've listed more worth looking into, and if so, what do you think might be discovered that will be most useful to the pizzagate investigation. For example: he's a pedo, a pedo apologist, a pedo enabler, possible victim, spokesperson for a shady nonprofit, practices a shady religion - some combination of those things - or something else. Or, because of the timing of his revived public interest in human trafficking, on the heels of pizzagate, we should just look for anything and everything.
           </p>
           <p>
            Things I've learned about Ashton Kuchter in the last hour or so of looking to the easy things:
           </p>
           <ul>
            <li>
             <p>
              According to Wikipedia, he had a
              <em>
               stressful
              </em>
              childhood. Sibling with severe disabilities, contemplated suicide, parents' divorce, juvenile conviction for burglary,
              <em>
               ostracized
              </em>
              by his school and community.
             </p>
            </li>
            <li>
             <p>
              He's a former model. There are past comments on this subverse that claim, the modeling profession is worse than the acting profession, as far as child abuse is concerned.
             </p>
            </li>
            <li>
             <p>
              As far as I see, he doesn't get a lot of high-profile work, or attention on talk shows these days.

              project has been around since 2009, when he was married to Demi Moore, plus the current popularity of pizzagate, it seems reasonable to question the timing of his tearful presentation to Congress - and to wonder about his timely motivation.

            My thoughts: AK is a mediocre but reasonably entertaining actor. He's a youngish good looking, and plays a competently funny stoner (in That 70's Show context), therefore his appeal spans several generations. He has a good start on a typical Hollywood-celebrity-failed-marriage history, at a young age (NOT blaming him for that, but there it is).

            (Wed March 11, 2015)
            <em>
             (CNN) - A Facebook post by actor Ashton Kutcher lamenting the lack of diaper changing tables in public men's rooms has parents talking.
            </em>

           <p>
            <em>
             The new father -- he and partner Mila Kunis welcomed baby Wyatt Isabelle in October -- complained to his followers that he had yet to encounter a changing table in the public bathrooms he visits. He offered to give a social media shout-out to the first business where he found a diapering table in the men's room.
            </em>
           </p>
           <p>
            <em>
             The post had logged more than 230,000 comments as of Wednesday morning. Lots of folks offered up places Kutcher should patronize, such as Walmart and Cracker Barrel, where they say changing tables abound.

            The adaptive AI "he" is developing is nothing short of an attack on the very concept of the Dark We ...... but then again the Dark Web hasn't cleaned it's own house when if comes to human exploitation. This could become a slippery slope so easily.

            oh come on.  I would be very very surprised.  Just a ridiculous assumption really.  But that's my opinion.

           <p>
            Haven't we always said, if it was just one piece of evidence, fine that was weird, but we have an avalanche of evidence.  Well there is no avalanche here that Demi Moore is literally a child rapist.  Just a bunch of prudes making a whole lot out of nothing IMHO.

             She even says herself in that video that she imagines they will become lovers at some point, or something along those lines. That's a young looking 15 year old boy, no matter how drunk you are that behaviour is massively inappropriate

             And If the genders were reversed you wouldn't be saying the same thing. I don't know why society seems to neglect boys and the fact that they can be abused by females. "Oh he probably wanted it" "he's just a boy " is the typical attitude of people when boys are taken advantage of by grown women.

              I think she thought she was bestowing a big gift on him.  Not saying it was right, but it's a long way from raping the kid.  It's an irresponsible accusation and does nothing to further the pizzagate investigation.

               I'm not saying this has anything to do with pizzagate or that she raped the kid wtf but I'm just pointing out the fact that people are completely ok with adult women molesting boys because "boys want it" .just pointing out society's hypocrisy.

                there are other insistent replies to me on this same comment declaring she is guilty of raping that kid because she certianly must have, it's clear, they can tell etc...so that accounts for my response.  They are probably shills just doing an effective number on me.

            I saw quite a long video, there was 1 creepy incident of her kissing the kid about 3 times, first lightly then again brushing lips, then a "first kiss" kind of kiss, although not a real french kiss.  There was a whole lot of her running around overexcited like it was the most special birthday party of her life, though it was the kids birthday party.
           </p>
           <p>
            Anyway, that's my take on it, if you feel differently that is fine with me.

             Recall that John Kerry as a VN vet appeared in Congress reading the most poetic testimony against war which allegedly was of his own authorship.

              It is impossible to describe to you exactly what did happen in Detroit, the emotions in the room, the feelings of the men who were reliving their experiences in Vietnam, but they did. They relived the absolute horror of what this country, in a sense, made them do.
             </p>
             <p>
              They told the stories at times they had personally raped, cut off ears, cut off heads, taped wires from portable telephones to human genitals and turned up the power, cut off limbs, blown up bodies, randomly shot at civilians, razed villages in fashion reminiscent of Genghis Khan, shot cattle and dogs for fun, poisoned food stocks, and generally ravaged the countryside of South Vietnam in addition to the normal ravage of war, and the normal and very particular ravaging which is done by the applied bombing power of this country.
             </p>
             <p>
              We call this investigation the "Winter Soldier Investigation." The term "Winter Soldier" is a play on words of Thomas Paine in 1776 when he spoke of the Sunshine Patriot and summertime soldiers who deserted at Valley Forge because the going was rough.
             </p>
             <p>
              We who have come here to Washington have come here because we feel we have to be winter soldiers now. We could come back to this country; we could be quiet; we could hold our silence; we could not tell what went on in Vietnam, but we feel because of what threatens this country, the fact that the crimes threaten it, not reds, and not redcoats but the crimes which we are committing that threaten it, that we have to speak out.
             </p>
             <p>
              FEELINGS OF MEN COMING BACK FROM VIETNAM
             </p>
             <p>
              I would like to talk to you a little bit about what the result is of the feelings these men carry with them after coming back from Vietnam. The country doesn't know it yet, but it has created a monster, a monster in the form of millions of men who have been taught to deal and to trade in violence, and who are given the chance to die for the biggest nothing in history; men who have returned With a sense of anger and a sense of betrayal which no one has yet grasped.
As a veteran and one who feels this anger, I would like to talk about it. We are angry because we feel we have been used in the worst fashion by the administration of this country.

            I have seen him on shark tank several times and then watched him the other day testifying and I get two very different impressions. On shark tank he rubs me the wrong way bc he is coming across as if he's had the success of Steve Jobs and is the smartest guy in the room. It's a turn off and also makes me wonder where his arrogance comes from since I've always thought that he was decently funny and an ok actor at best, but this is a very different persona. I want to punch him bc he didn't CREATE anything. Dude had some money, got some good advice on what to invest in, and scored some more dough. Most people who are in early on investments that blow up have insider info on it being a "chosen" program/product. Think uber, FB, Twatter. These things don't accidentally blow up. So he's def in some "club".
           </p>
           <p>
            His testimony was super uncomfortable bc the "crying" came off as totally fake. I've done acting for years and it appeared very much like he was reading lines and attempting to connect emotionally to them and couldn't.

            I remember reading an article on a flight, that Mila Kunis was 14 y/o on That 70s Show when it started.
            <a href="https://moviepilot.com/posts/3543201">

            </a>
            .  She lied about her age when auditioning.  Still Kutcher was making out with a 14 y/o, in front of thousands at the time.  Another source
            <a href="http://www.ifc.com/shows/that-70s-show/blog/2015/11/10-things-you-didnt-know-about-that-70s-show">

            .  JEEZ...http://www.popsugar.com/entertainment/Ashton-Kutcher-Mila-Kunis-70s-Show-34204704.  No one cared about this when reporting on it?

            Like with OP, I'm conflicted with him too. He seems genuine and says things that align with the truth about the situation of child trafficking, yet the people he's running with seem sketchy. I think any of the following possibilities are plausible:
           </p>
           <ul>
            <li>
             <p>
              1) He's acting and is evil and knows what he is doing, or
             </p>
            </li>
            <li>
             <p>
              2) He's sincere but ignorant of those around him, because he's getting their funding. And the higher ups want to cling to him as a way to look "good" to steer themselves away from the spotlight. This would be similar to the defense of Joe Paterno that OP talked about. Or
             </p>
            </li>
            <li>
             <p>
              3) He is good, but he knows who he is dealing with and is playing Kira/Light role from Death Note, keeping his enemies close. Not sure if he is that intelligent, given what happened with the Joe Paterno thing.
             </p>
            </li>
           </ul>
           <p>
            After typing this out, feels like number 2 is probably most likely followed by a close tie between 1 and 3. Just my personal opinion based on gut. No science here.

             Kutcher is blatantly obviously a puppet. They just trotted him out there to acclimate the people to the limited hangout we are seeing before our eyes....

             Excellent article! This is the kind of research that gets the normies attention. People from all walks of life and both sides of the isle. It makes my skin crawl how these orgs are in no way actually interested in their supposed mission. It's like a half ass effort just to continue bilking the tax payer and making money on the side from the repugnant and evil trafficking they claim to be fighting.

             Yeah, that's a classic Hollywood Beard formula. The older chick who's career is on the decline, partners up with the young up and coming stud to disguise his sexual habits. Either being gay or into kids.

             Anybody here actually think Justin Timberlake is straight? They use younger women than Demi, but with similar career lags.

             PizzaGate entry on Pugs.  While it was written about in the Spectator, most PizzaGaters learned of Pugs because it was mentioned in Jeff Epstein's "little black book."  Again, Demi Moore has been named their "Mistress of Chamber."

             Your other points were good, but I think comparing such relationships with paedophilia is counterproductive. Blurring the distinction between paedophilia  and voluntary relationships between consenting adults has the long-term effect of normalising paedophilia — even if  the distinction in this case is being blurred by condemning
             <em>
              both
             </em>
             as 'paedophilia', the long-term consequences of drawing such an equivalency will be the same.
            </p>
            <p>
             Likewise, a 25 year-old male in a relationship with a 16 year-old female  can be criticised for many
             <em>
              other
             </em>
             reasons  but it would be a huge error to view such an individual as a  "paedophile", since the relationship in question is a  voluntary relationship between biological adults. In virtually all cultures (including Western cultures until about thirty years ago), such a relationship would be viewed as a normal adult relationship.
            </p>
            <p>
             To lump relatively normal adult relationships  into the same category as 'paedophilia' sets a dangerous social precedent that can only be harmful to children in the long run. This recent social trend by which the concept of paedophillia is continually expanded so that it includes normal  or harmless adult relationships, makes paedophilia seem more and more normal to regular people. To speak of harmless adult relationships as "just another form of paedophilia", is to spit in the faces of the victims of real  paedophilia.
            </p>
            <p>
             No matter how you look at it, raping a five year old child should not be compared with regular adult relationships, regardless of the magnitude of the age discrepancy between the adults in question.

              There is such a thing as ephebophilia

              A lot of Dennis Hastert's activities fell into this category. Legally speaking, this is very much a no-no when you're talking about under-16s, depending on the age of consent where you live. Personally I feel that there is always some form of advantage taking by the older party occurring in these 'relationships'. Remember that whole 'cougar'/milf thing? Normalisation of ephebophilia?

              I agree with you partially, but how can you compare a 25 year old being with anyone of any age pedo? 18 is an adult anywhere.
             </p>
             <p>
              16 year old is different, that is a minor and illegal in a 50 states. There can't be more than a certain age difference. I think it's something like 3 years. So a 25 year old with a 16 year old is absolutely illegal.
 Once someone is 18, no matter what the age difference it is not illegal and I don't think anyone would call it pedophilia.
             </p>
             <p>
              It makes people like me who don't know a lot about this pizzagate stuff question it all when someone claims it's not illegal for a 25 year old to be with a 16 year old. Or that somehow a 25 year old man with a 40 year old woman is pedophilia. It makes people question if this isn't just a witch hunt of hated individuals.
I am not saying it's a witch-hunt but I don't think saying this kind of stuff is helpful. 
I really didn't understand why so many people were opposed to this pizzagate. I mean who could ever be against stopping human trafficking and child rape but then I read stuff like this and I don't know what to believe.

               I strongly urge you to keep following the pizza gate citizen investigation. It is about the elite untouchable class using its power to enable itself to commit acts of unspeakable horror against the most vulnerable members of the population. We are talking about child (as young as babies) trafficking. These poor souls are sometimes bred just for that purpose. They are also used in snuff films and then just thrown away. All this has been exposed and yet somehow it's "fake news", because the media is controlled by these sick perverts. Comet Ping Pong has become important for its link to this class of people in Washington  D.C.As hoers have pointed out, you don't get to own approx 13 pieces of hot d.c. properties and be known as the 49th most powerful man in Washington D.C. if all you are is a pizza shop owner---uhuh--the cash is coming from trafficking.  However, "comet pingpong " types of places exist everywhere in the world.

                I appreciate your calm moderate response. It isn't that I don't think human trafficking of  children happens. It has to be the most abhorrent thing on the face of this earth. I am certain the elite are involved to some extent, it's common knowledge of their disgusting Lolita islands. 
But some of what I read reminds me of the 80's Satanic witch hunts. It seems far fetched to me that these sickos would be openly using "secret" symbols and posts on their Facebook page about abusing children. I don't believe in a room full of weirdos run the world with Satanic rituals. I think it's much more complex and actually terrifying than that. It scares me that it's a false flag to divide us. 
I will look further into to it. I have made a friend here on Voat who has given me places to start. I will keep an open mind. 
I did read some disturbing transcripts someone posted on
                <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/v/pizzagate">
                 v/pizzagate
                </a>
                where some (I don't even want to call them human) was trying to buy little children. They were negotiating price etc. I couldn't believe what I was reading. That was obviously very real.
But to connect it some Satanic cult or that they are ritually killing kids and using code words on Facebook and that they all meet at pizza shops is where I start to think, this is a false flag.
I have tremendous respect for anyone who has the stomach to chase down this horrible human traffickers.  But destroying anyone who doesn't fit into our political or social construct as a Satanic baby killer pedophile isn't helping these children. It is drawing attention away from the real traffickers. 
I hope I made sense. I am saying this because everyone I have talked to about this feels very similarly. Yes, it exists but there is also a witch hunt going on after those in the opposing camp. Maybe chasing down this kind of stuff starts making you see monsters in all the shadows.

              I don't isolate the dots.  Every dot is a part of the larger picture.
             </p>
             <p>
              We see the same large age discrepancy between Sam Taylor-Wood and now husband-Aaron (she 42, he 19).  BTW, STW (director of Shades of Grey) is good friends with Elton John and was photographed eyeing pedo art with him.  Ergo, she has been brought into the PizzaGate discussion.

               http://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-3045469/People-call-Benjamin-Button-reveals-hubbie-Sam-Taylor-Johnson.html
              </a>
             </p>
             <p>
              These very LARGE age discrepancies are REMARKABLE, which is why everyone talks about these couples.  Most people recognize that these people grew up in different generations and probably have VERY little in common.
             </p>
             <p>
              Again, take it in isolation if you wish.  Coupled with the other dots -- her activity in an Epstein-affiliated "secret society" and her passionate kissing of a young boy -- this DOES indicate pedo activity.

               To say a relationship between a 40 yr old and a 25 yr old is pedophilic is really quite sick. Might as well say that equine lover DOES practice bestiality.

               Ive heard interesting and credible theories from people like Freeman Fly about how female celebrities become the biggest sluts due to having to go through intense sexual initiations in order to be allowed into the high status Hollywood cliques. This could be why women like Brittney spears break down, their mind control has worn off and they resort back to the altar of their 12 year old mindset.
              </p>
              <p>
               I think Demi here is a victim of the same mind control, and like all perverts, she preys on weak victims in order to recruit them.
              </p>
              <p>
               Hollywood is sick.

                I think the idea is that you just don't survive Hollywood unless you're already twisted in some way. Likely molested young, promiscuity and emotional neediness follows. Throw in some level of luck, talent and aggressiveness and you have a Hollywood Survivor.
               </p>
               <p>
                Otherwise you have to be Meryl Streep levels of talented to get anywhere. And even then she's only kept around to "prove" Hollywood isn't totally about young hot pretty women actors who can suck the chrome off a trailer hitch.

                 You think Meryl Streep is a big hollyweird star because she has "talent"? Sorry yo break it to you but, she is a puppet to the same system.
Not to mention, I think she is LITERALLY the most overrated actor!

              To me she looked like a 19 year old at a birthday party that was tipsy drunk.  I think she kissed that kid to give him his "first kiss" and it was a birthday present type thing.  it was what 1989?  We didn't have the conversation back then about pc innappropriateness, power differentials, and pedophilia that we have today.

             This is what raises my eyebrows.  ANYBODY who is ok with McCain, including his daughter is not ok autmatically.  But I still just don't know if he doesn't know any better, has no choice, or what.  He is not the type to normally support McCain being a Hollywood liberal, so did he need the $ and make a deal with the devel and see it that way?  Or was he approached with an offer from the deep state he couldn't refuse...?  Jury still out on that for me.

                  They're both actors. That's all they have uncommon. Kutcher could very well be anything we assume he might be despite whatever connection he has to Reagan.

              His name is Chris. He is a self-absorbed model, actor, and opportunist. He is also a smart, handsome and somewhat cool guy, and he is a hat wearing Freemason and pantsuit wearing Kabbalist. Maybe he is really a good person deep down, and just isn't aware or high enough up yet to understand what role he is playing yet. He was brought into the system, and is in way above his head. He is being used, and is using the system. Now he is partnering with Mark Cuban and John McCain to be a leader of his generation. He has some good ideas and has leveraged things to his advantage along the way, and he is being propped up as Mr. Good Guy for McCain and the others involved, because he is a good face that can help cover up for the real evil and Global Criminal Corruption that is going on behind the scenes. They will arrest as many low and mid levels they can, with a few higher ups, and pat themselves on the back for it. Ashton Kutcher is not going to save the world from the system he benefits from.

              Ashton is like Paul Ryan - the boy scout face to put up front while they real crimes are committed out back. Paul Ryan's home district is an epicenter for Pizzagate and Global Criminal Corruption. If Ashton Kutcher or Donald Trump had any real intentions of draining the swamp, we will see what they will do about holding their own circles of colleagues accountable first, knowing how Hollywood and Racine are both connected to Pizzagate and Global Criminal Corruption. Racine is also near the home area of Reince Priebus and Scott Walker's Miilwaukee, nearby Obama and Emanuel's Chicago, with ties to Denver, Colorado known for its Freemason ties and Allentown, Pennsylvania another hotbed of corruption close to Penn State University, and other areas around the world such as Haiti, Ghana, Norway, Brazil and more. Racine, Wisconsin serves as a barometer for whether Donald Trump is an actor like Chris is, or willing to change history and solve the bigger puzzle of Pizzagate and Global Criminal Corruption, or he is just like Chris and only brought in to be the face while they make deals to file bankruptcy and move on under a new plan and name. Let's hope they aren't just the newest crop of lying actors.

               Great post, was thinking the same thing. The problem with Trump is that he's too good to be true and the narrative of how he gamed the media while they tried to smear him is too well established and ubiquitously accepted within the MSM for me to believe he isn't there by design. Just another wolf in sheep's clothing, like Obama. All future presidents will be equally groomed and will emulate this model; we'll see gradually increasing populism and ever diminishing journalism coupled with vilification of alternate news as fake news, until they create a ministry of truth, engineer a false flag event and blame it on another muslim russian as a pretext to start WWIII.

                 Trump is a billionaire himself, don't presume he accepted any legally compromising gifts. I'd like to believe he's Machiavellian, like he's keeping his enemies closer re: Epstein, but who knows. You can also discover things about a person, on their island per se, which might change your opinion of a person; I don't happen to know the chronology of his visiting the island and his making remarks endorsing Epstein, but without that knowledge, i wouldn't be so quick to judge.
                </p>
                <p>
                 Ok, so I figured I would look into it and I can't find any dates on either. That said, here's what I observed while searching:
                </p>
                <p>
                 The Daily Wire piece I'm reading (
                 <a href="http://www.dailywire.com/news/5749/both-trump-and-clinton-went-jeffrey-epsteins-sex-amanda-prestigiacomo">
                  http://www.dailywire.com/news/5749/both-trump-and-clinton-went-jeffrey-epsteins-sex-amanda-prestigiacomo)
                 </a>
                 ) said, " Per The Political Insider, Trump is accused of threatening and raping a 13-year-old girl on the private island. Epstein is also named in the suit for sexual misconduct. The lawsuit accusations have been vehemently denied by the Trump camp, alleging that the filing is a “hoax” and that there is “no evidence” that the plaintiff in question “actually exists.”"
                </p>
                <p>
                 Keep in mind that Trump denies the plaintiff even exists, which might mean nothing, but this same article sensationalized how many times Clinton had been to the island while not numerically referencing Trump's visit count, which lead me to believe it was solitary. So, I found another tidbit from which to possibly glimpse something.
                </p>
                <p>
                 Vice ran an article in which they said "There is no debate over what happened," Edwards told VICE news. "I served Mr. Trump with a subpoena for deposition in 2009. He talked to me voluntarily, and consequently we withdrew the subpoena in light of his voluntarily providing information…. I can't imagine there being any dispute of any of this."
                </p>
                <p>
                 Edwards also said that it is "obvious" Trump himself was not involved in any of Epstein's illicit activity."
                </p>
                <p>
                 So, take from it what you want. Bu,t having been to someone's island doesn't necessarily make you complicit in crimes they might commit there. Just saying.

               Not to mention Dahmer.  Podesta sculpture.  I've heard Dahmer was frequenting gay bath houses in Chicago when just a lad.  Chicago is bad too. And where did Dahmer learn all that depravity?

                Yeah, I'd say that would be the purpose of Natalie Portman's little testimony on his levels of knowledge.

               <p>
                He's pretty, but his public persona is that of an affable dumb guy. So the goal would be to leverage his prettiness, while boosting this idea that he has "hidden intelligence", and present him as the new face of whatever deal is actually being set up behind the scenes.

                At the very least, he'll win over all the women, and that may be enough votes or public support to achieve whatever it is they need.
