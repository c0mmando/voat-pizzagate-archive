                I don't understand how a hospital is a pharm company? BI'm totally convinced DNC people killed  Seth, so I'm not arguing.  I'm just trying to understand.

                Since I've been following too many leads and too many forums and twitter etc etc, this one is new to me.  Can you cliff note me on medstar the company and medstar the hospital?

                 Understand that a hospital, like any company, has many departments- surgery, imaging, labor &amp; delivery, pharmacy, etc... No one mentioned a Pharm Company.
                </p>
                <p>
                 Every hospital has a Pharmacy and a Pharmacy Department.

                  I understand hospitals - have a child that had cancer.  He fought and won.  Thank the Lord and Saint Jude's hospital!

                 <p>
                  But I had read somewhere that medstar was a pharmaceutical COMPANY - not a pharmacy - I didn't make that clear when I said Pharm.  Sorry.

                  Anyway my confusion was thinking it was a pharmaceutical company.  I understand now though.Thx!!

               I would like to know as well, but I don't know why it would be anything but Medstar. They were the only equipped for that kind of trauma surgery(plus Dr. Sava). That with MedAnons post on 4 chan about the LEOs and Seth having VIP detail on him (and his experience and terminology backed up by other ICU nurses) makes me almost sure it Medstar, but you'd think this would be very attainable and not incriminating information for Medstar to give....

           <p>
            I struggling with the idea that some of these emails really mean what people are assuming they mean.
           </p>
           <p>
            The emails about the kids in the pool, for example, just really feels to me like playful or silly language.
           </p>
           <p>
            Said another way, it would be like saying "The kids are surely going to love swimming in that pool, expect to be entertained!"
           </p>
           <p>
            Entertained, as in, it is always quite a thing when the kids are around! Also, as in, "Please don't mind my obnoxious, rambunctious, wild kids!"
           </p>
           <p>
            There are other TP emails that also just have a silly or social or familiar vibe between friends.
           </p>
           <p>
            I believe that SRA is real and I also believe that there is SOMETHING very wrong happening overall, but there are too many of these emails that are being elevated to say "X", when in my mind, they may just truly be saying what they are saying, though in an awkward manner, perhaps.
           </p>
           <p>
            The emails weren't composed for the World to see. Some were just communications between friends, for example. People into food, dining, entertaining, socializing.
           </p>
           <p>
            When I text back and forth to my friends, there is often double-meaning, entendre and inside jokes. If people read them, they would think all sorts of things that are actually opposite of reality.
           </p>
           <p>
            When I say to my friend: The bitches were in heat last night - it actually means NOTHING other than there were some cute girls at out local hang, for example.
           </p>
           <p>
            But if one were to string together a year or two of out interplay and put them out there without context, it only looks like we are saying things that we aren't.
           </p>
           <p>
            I'm just concerned that sometimes we're seeing what may not be anything at all, and perhaps not seeing what is there to be seen.
           </p>
           <p>
            I very frequently have this sinking feeling about TP emails, not really meaning what PG'ers are implying.
           </p>
           <p>
            JA and the Instagram and the bands, etc --- different story and TP creeps me out, but I just find some of this language casual and familiar between friends, etc. and some downright creepy.
           </p>
           <p>
            Anyone else struggle with this?

             Yes I'm willing to suspend some judgement---but I think when a pattern does emerge ,it's good to be aware. these people seem to have their fingers in a whole lot of pies wherein many devious activities can be covered,and  I know from having viewed an Oprah show from 25 years ago, that" fine upright citizens "were sacrificing babies and the whistleblower was saying that it was acceptable among some Jewish sects. But as you say, we know that there are horrible things going on all the time with children re: trafficking/killing etc but not EVERYTHING is a clue.

              "But as you say, we know that there are horrible things going on all the time with children re: trafficking/killing etc but not EVERYTHING is a clue."
             </p>
             <p>
              This is well stated. The whole thing stings out loud. Something does feel to be amiss, I just don't like getting too messy with the thinking.
             </p>
             <p>
              I feel like I've lived through several lifetimes since PG started for me.
             </p>
             <p>
              The first three months of near endless wretching, crying, rage, etc. really turned me upside down and inside and out.
I was able to get ahold of myself when I more or less reassured myself with "truth".
             </p>
             <p>
              Is it true, that people kill people?
Is it true that people rape people?
Is it true that people steal from each other?
             </p>
             <p>
              I kept going down such a mental list and then added in PG related questions.
             </p>
             <p>
              This helped me pierce my emotional outrage with some sense of "control", by realizing that just like there are serial killers and sadists and etc etc, there are also people that make, view, trade, delight in, sadistic child porn. (All child porn is sadistic in my mind.)
             </p>
             <p>
              It is also true that people do abuse their children and others, etc.
             </p>
             <p>
              It was along these lines that I was able to digest the notion that PG COULD be VERY real.
And that once I got beyond the possibility, I was able to tone down my emotional response, to then try to view things as rationally and logically as possible.
             </p>
             <p>
              I believe that those of us that are here, probably had to go through similar experiences to be able to see this all so completely.

               No, you aren't the only one that is able to look at something and go "wait a minute? Does this really mean what everyone think it means?" Just shows you have a sharp mind. Kudos.

              <p>
               And I totally get where you are coming from with the emotions. It's all very hard to read about when you consider that it happens to actual kids. : ( Thanks for being here and speaking up because you're right. There's a lot of wild and crazy speculation that goes on in these subs. Even for believers like me some of it has us shaking our heads and rolling our eyes.

             I definitely struggle with a lot of accepted "facts" around pizzagate,  and I think you have you head screwed on correctly for questioning it.   However,  that email specifically, is just creepy.  I could see where you're coming from as far as being playful among friends in a private email, but why is mentioning their ages necessary?

              That's a good question. Part of me would see it as suspicious and the other part of me would see it as part of making plans.
             </p>
             <p>
              Commonly my friends with kids refer to their kids ages in conversation.
             </p>
             <p>
              It is sort of like a "heads up" thing.
             </p>
             <p>
              When someone says I'm going to bring my kids over, it is almost like the next question on people's minds: "How old are the kids?"
             </p>
             <p>
              Why?
             </p>
             <p>
              Because it tells the host what preparations, if any, may need to be made.
             </p>
             <p>
              By saying the ages, it tells the host, in this case, don't worry, they are old enough to swim, for example and/or are self-sufficient in the context of being company.
             </p>
             <p>
              They aren't infants or toddlers -- not need to child-proof the house.
             </p>
             <p>
              That said, I'm not proving or even trying to prove this one way or the other, it just seems that many parents mention their kids ages all the time.
             </p>
             <p>
              "I'm bringing my 9-year old."
"My toddler."
"My baby, etc."
             </p>
             <p>
              Thanks for not flaming me.
             </p>

              I have a curious mind and curiosity for me is truth-seeking, however it lands.
             </p>
             <p>
              Edit: By stating it also, parents are in some way "asking for permission to bring their kids", sort of "preparing the host" for what to expect and saying "don't mind the kids."  The word "entertainment" may have been used as a way to soft-shoe the mayhem that will be caused by them being there.
             </p>
             <p>
              "Oh yes, ahem, you'll be entertained! Don't say I didn't warn you!"
             </p>
             <p>
              That's how the email "feels" to me.
             </p>
             <p>
              If she were bringing three kids over to be molested, I suspect she might have just said, I'll bring them kids over later. Why spell it all out if that was really what she was saying?

             Nope.  It's easy to see the actual coded language.  People that have been on 4chan for years recognize this codes all too well from the CP creepers that were constantly banned or removed over there.  Having the FBI confirm the existence of these code words made it even more obvious.
            </p>
            <p>
             I can see the "kids in the pool" being part of the entertainment in a casual way.  But why would someone in the previous email detail each child and their age and then let everyone know they will be in the spa for our entertainment?  That's just bizarre.  If I had friends coming over for a dinner party and I knew that some kids would be swimming I would just say "hey guys, there are probably going to be some kids at the party swimming. FYI if you are brining kids over they can swim too!"
            </p>
            <p>
             That would sound more normal than the way these people talk.  Especially about walnut sauce, dominoes and pizza maps that are on black and white napkins.  Cus we all lose pizza maps don't we?

              I see what appears to be very coded language in many of the emails. I do seriousy agree that some of this is way odd, awkward and outright suspicious, but I'm also challenged by the ping of doubt on SOME of it.
             </p>
             <p>
              Some of it does seem innocuous.
             </p>
             <p>
              It is true that there are many ways TO say something, but people don't always express themselves that predictably.
             </p>
             <p>
              I emailed a girl that emailed me for the first time last week. I wrote back really stupid shit!
             </p>
             <p>
              Had I been in regular contact with that person, I would have replied totally differently.
             </p>
             <p>
              Anyway, I'm not here to cast unreasonable doubt. Just want to know what is ultimately true as we all do.

               I agree with this and not much is proven by the language there. Kids can be a barrel of freakin monkeys, especially at pool time. Could be taken either way and therefor doesn't hold to much weight.

             Your comment has NOTHING to do with the FACT that the Seth Rich death is now linked to ANOTHER individual from within the DNC- Bonnie Levin. Whether or not you find the content of the emails nefarious has NO BEARING on the FACT that they were sent from a VP of Pharmacy Services from the facility where Seth Rich arrived alive.
            </p>
            <p>
             So again, regardless of the content, this individual was directly connected to Podesta and the DNC via emails and historical documentation of providing transport/logistics to an event for minors (in swimsuits). Why aren't their own parents driving them is a question for another thread. So is why were they there at all?

               Kind of like the question having nothing to do with the thread, right? The thread is illustrating a connection between podesta, emails, levin, Medstar, and Seth Rich, not a feeling seminar on our opinions of the content of the emails. Start a new thread to discuss that.
              </p>
              <p>
               The purpose here is to illustrate the interconnectedness to these many elements of their individual Bonnie Levin. My response is 100% related to the OP. The response is an attempt to keep people on topic. thanks.

                The guys question is about the sinister nature of the email between the two individuals that op is trying to establish a connection between.  How is that not related to the thread?

                 I am the OP. Please refrain from telling me what I am 'trying to establish', as the facts speak for themselves.  I have not made mention of the content of the emails, except in the title of the Op, as it is quite a memorable email for most. The fact that a named person in a Podesta email is ALSO a VP of Pharmacy at the crime scene (the hospital where Seth Rich's life was ended) is the pertinent fact of this thread. The content of the email, speculation upon interpretation, etc, changes none of the facts.
                </p>
                <p>
                 Again, the facts:
                </p>
                <p>
                 Bonnie Levin is VP of Pharmacy Services at  Medstar Washington Hospital Center (which is located just 3 minutes away from where he was shot)
                </p>
                <p>
                 Bonnie Levin has been used in the past and is a familiar asset to Podesta/DNC for solutions (as illustrated by the 'further entertainment' email.
                </p>
                <p>
                 Bonnie Levin is now the SECOND hospital staffer tied to the DNC/Clinton/White House after the surgeon Dr. Sava
                </p>
                <p>
                 The email itself provides a connection between Bonnie Levin and Podesta.
                </p>
                <p>
                 Her profession, public knowledge, is as VP of Pharmacy services at the MedStar hospital.
                </p>
                <p>
                 This thread is illustrating that this person, Bonnie Levin, is connected to Podesta/the emails AND the facility in which Seth Rich died.

              That's correct. My comment has nothing whatsoever to do with those "connections" and your comment has nothing whatsoever to do with mine.
             </p>
             <p>
              To say that because these people are all so "connected" to each other and then assuming X,Y and Z as a result is occasionally bordering on the ridiculous.
             </p>
             <p>
              Of course they are connected. Yes, they all know each other.
             </p>
             <p>
              How many people do you know? How you know them? How did you meet?
             </p>
             <p>
              I email lots of people that I have no real "connection" with.
             </p>
             <p>
              Remember, these people are in POLITICS. It is their function to KNOW everyone! They thrive on connections.
             </p>
             <p>
              They even EMAIL each other.
             </p>
             <p>
              Everyone works somewhere.
People MAKE connections VIA work, school, church, community, etc
             </p>
             <p>
              Don't misread what I'm saying.
             </p>
             <p>
              These folks KNOW each other. That is not being denied, but it takes a rather epic leap to make the assumption that because they KNOW each other, that somehow proves all else.
             </p>
             <p>
              Why WOULDN"T they be connected? The connections they share is how they know each other.
             </p>
             <p>
              Isn't it how ALL people know each other?
             </p>
             <p>
              Think of all the people here in PG.
             </p>
             <p>
              Aren't we all connected in some way here?
             </p>
             <p>
              Do mere connections prove causality?

               I didn't post this as PROOF of anything, other than another connection to Seth Rich, which happens to curiously in this case be an additional connection to the Podesta Emails/pizzagate.
              </p>
              <p>
               If you do not find it a worthy thread to pull, that someone named in a Podesta email, who is also both a Hospital Pharmacy VP and an uber driver, also works at the same hospital where Seth Rich arrived alive, then you perhaps are not examining this information with the attention to detail and the mindset of no such things as coincidences, as the rest of us.
              </p>
              <p>
               Your position is 'yes these people know each other', but in the same breath 'no, that is not strange or indicative of anything'. Most of us here will disagree with the latter statement.

             It's deeper and it's not, now one player performing multiple connections somewhat limits the size of the hole, relative to say if her cousin was the VP which is two people and another connection. When you start to see multiple issues with the same person imo you are getting to identify the size of the hole. Like if you had a pile of skeletons and had no idea how many bodies were in it, and you started comparing bones, if you took 100 legs and found almost all could be matched into pairs  from the same body then then the sample isn't that big, if you took 100 legs and nothing was part of a pair that means there's so many bodies you didnt even get a match out of 100. I'd call this a match and shows the same group connected to drugs, transport, murder and child abuse, so it's smaller than if all those different facets were diffrent groups. Maybe a smaller core pulling the strings than we thought?

              RE Smaller core group
             </p>
             <p>
              good point
             </p>
             <p>
              wonder what the investigators from Franklin cover up would say...   did their trail end with a core group too or  was it bigger, more widespread than they thought.   a good question to look at.
