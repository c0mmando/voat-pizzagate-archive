<p>1) News reporter for WDBJ7 in Roanoke, Virginia, obtains court documents from another state showing that prominent local lawyer Daniel L. Crandall has a restraining order against him for sexually abusing their small daughter.</p>
<p>2) The alleged pedophile, Daniel L. Crandall, contributes over half a million dollars annually to WDBJ7. The station refuses to report the information and later Orlando Salinas is fired.</p>
<p>3) Salinas goes public with his information, including doing a local radio show, detailing the evidence he was going to use in his suppressed news report. Crandall\'s ex-wife, he said, had testified to him that once during a monitored phone call between Daniel Crandall and his small daughter, Crandall mentioned &quot;chiclets&quot; to her, asking her if she would like any chiclets, at which point the child went to the bathroom and took off all of her clothes, according to the mother. This is said to be a classic sign of childhood sexual abuse.</p>
<p>4) Salinas is later charged with rape himself, but then later acquitted, charges dropped, without much else said about it.</p>
<p>5) The same news station that takes its money from Daniel L. Crandall and refused to report on his alleged abuse to his own daughter (WDBJ7) , is also the station of the live shooting of news reporter Alison Parker and her cameraman Adam Ward by former employee Vester Flanagan.</p>
<p>6) Another anchor from this same news station, Chris Hurst, claimed after the shooting that Alison was his girlfriend and that they had been secretly engaged (even though Alison\'s Facebook page was full of pictures of her with another guy). He claimed that he was now too emotionally distraught to work at WDBJ7, and entered politics instead. He just won election to the Virginia House of Delegates in a conservative district, backed by millions of dollars from liberal think tanks based in California.</p>
<p>7) Hurst won election to the House of Delegates based on votes received from the Virginia Tech campus and surrounding suburbs. Virginia Tech has been the site of several odd incidents and was testified to as the home of a CIA MK ULTRA program in the 1990s.</p>
<p>So in all of the above related people and organizations we have:</p>
<p>1) An alleged pedophile lawyer
2) A top, award-winning regional news station
3) Local politics commandeered by Virginia Tech
4) The CIA\'s MK ULTRA program</p>
<p>Can someone make some arrests please?</p>

            : This is a really confusing post. Are the two married? Are they both pedophiles? When did this happen? Why do you feel this is directly related to the sexual abuse of kids by the global elite? How does it help the PG investigation? Is this guy connected to the Clinton Cabal in any way?

            You will get a lot more traction if you can state why it's important at the beginning in one sentence, and provide timestamps to the spot in the video that talks about each key point you've outlined above.
           </p>
           <p>
            I'm going to leave this up, because it seems like you are onto something and you've clearly put some work into it. But it really needs more work  if you want people to take the time to look into it. I tried to watch the video, but it did not get to the point either. Please edit. You may want to remove the post yourself and repost a better version if you want to get more traction.

            WDBJ7 is a CBS affiliate, not a public television channel, so why does Crandall "contribute" over half a million annually to it?  Is he some kind of operative who pays the station for control over its content?

            Also, in July 2016, two VA Tech students lured a young girl (13) out of her home to what she thought was a rendezvous  of romantic and lasting proportions. The college students were girlfriend and boyfriend and evidently both were pedaphiles. I don't remember many details of the story but I do remember her family did not know she was on clandestine social media and she was extremely lonely. I remember at the time the  male college student had followers on instagrem who made nonsensical  comments about loving "cheese pizza." All this was before the Podesta emails and red piling me about urban dictionary lingo,. I also remember the girl college student said she went along with scheme to kill the poor girl, "because she wanted to see what it was like to kill a human being." This statement made me completely uneasy about the state of the world and our college students being evil monsters. State police officers  were able to catch them by reviewing tapes of local hardware stores at their cashier stations.  I still shudder when I think of the terror this poor little girl experienced. And, now that I know so much more about how Satan worshippers covet the blood of terrorized victims, what also happened at the college campus made a little more (completely sad) sense. These two students were at Tech with sports scholarships, and I remember some people saying in dismay, that they were sorry for the college students because  they had such a chance of "going places" be cause of their athleticism. Gee  no sadness for the 13 year old middle school student who had survived a kidney transplant, only to die at the hands of monsters?

              I will see if I can find it.  At the time, I knew absolutely nothing about all this going on about "child porn."  I remember thinking, that is a weird comment, why would food be brought into a conversation about dating people?  (At the time, I thought it was kind of nice to see something "that wasn't so weird" in the conversation.)
It was on his instagram followers.  The young girl was on the tween "dating" site that the murderer was "stalking" to find a likely victim.
I have to take classes at work (deemed by the upper powers that be who regulate our workplace) and within the last year, the classes talked about tweeners going to the sites, and being able to keep their parents from knowing what they are saying, doing, posting, planning.  At my work, we have to know what is going on with the young people, but, they are way smarter about media than we are.  And, that right there, is how these poor, unsuspecting, young people get lured into whatever the predators are planning.  It is so evil and makes my stomach turn to think about it.  (We seem to protect our dear pets more than we can protect our young humans.  Something needs to be done to stop it and stop the propaganda to disclaim it-Elsagate, I am thinking about, is beyond evil, and these predators are just laughing at us.)

            Great post, though I'd characterize the Virginia Tech alleged massacre of 32 people in 2007 as something more than an "odd incident."

             Daniel L. Crandall is a very powerful lawyer in the Roanoke Valley and surrounding regions (including the Virginia Tech campus area) and he has been accused of being a pedophile and molesting his own daughter. His commercials are always on TV, the local civic center where Trump campaigned is covered in banners with his face and law firm's name all over them. He is a central figure in the area with lots of influence and power, and he is accused of the same sick pedophilia and abuse that we see in CIA programs, meanwhile we have allegations since the 1990s that a CIA program (MK ULTRA) is being run off of the Virginia Tech campus.
            </p>
            <p>
             Authorities need to look into all of this as they roll up the CIA. There is pretty clearly a very corrupt political/legal/media/pedophile/CIA power network pulling strings in the area and it needs to be dismantled. A local representative to the US House, Bob Goodlatte, just announced that he will not be seeking re-election, and he very likely had ties to this very same power structure. So maybe this is a sign that it's all about to be rolled up anyway. But I want to make sure that people are looking into this local network, because I think I've pretty well pegged a chunk of it and I can think of other extensions of it as well. The university itself (Virginia Tech) has also become a corrupting cultural influence upon the region, as leftist universities usually are, all the same pink haired commie types, or else Muslims in hijabs, in the heart of Appalachia.
