            Thats a pretty subjective definition of pedophilia in wikipedia. It would be a stretch to call it reality in which the definition is "the world or the state of things as they actually exist, as opposed to an idealistic or notional idea of them" Its not that rare that some girls can be late bloomers and start puberty by getting there period as late as 15 or 16 therefore making your wikipedia definition an idealistic, subjective and notional view. Tell me, do you think a 75 year old that bangs a 14 year old that hasn't had her period a pedophile. If not, you have problems.....

            Does it really matter if the 15 year old is someone you are sending crotch shots of you in your underwear to while your two year old little boy is asleep next to that "bulge" in your shorts you are so proud of. Should we post a picture to clear up your questions of him being a pedophile who deserves and did not have any level of clearance that would have allowed him to receive the SOS Clinton classified emails from Huma to print in NYC His apartment should have been raided and all evidence seized at the time. Enough said. The FBI blew it the question is intentional or not?

            Would sick fuck be more appropriate? I understand the difference between 15 and 5 years old but there is also a big difference between 15 and 18. There is a lot of growing up that happens in those 3 years of high school. I understand that its natural for men to fantasize about having sex with a girl as young as 18, but to carry it out (w/o being a rock star or celebrity) takes a predatory approach targeted at the "victims" weaknesses and insecurities. I do think a 40+ year old going after a 15 year old is a pedophille. Dude, that's a freshman in high school, they are still going through puberty! Not to mention  that in one of the pics Weiner is sending a selfie of himself with a full erection right next to his infant baby. Just think about the pics we haven't seen and the stories we haven't heard.

             Don't waste your time with shills.  He's trying to split a hair that doesn't exist.  Reality says he'll probably be going to jail for aberrant sexual activity with a minor.  Legal definitions may vary in different jurisdictions, but the reality is the same.

             No problem. Just like to write out loud loud the absolute hypocrisy &amp; stupidity of their testimony. The American people are very smart. Hell most people are smarter than what we are being subjected to. That is why we have to use our collective wisdom and call this out.

            Comey's testimony was bizarre and no one called him on it. He excuses both Huma and Weiner for lacking intent since the only purpose in forwarding the emails was  so Weiner could print them. So our SOS works in DC when she is not traveling having both a home office and government provided office, neither of which had  printers??? So just forward material to NYC for Weiner to print and then what does he do with it? Courier it up to Hillary's 2nd home in Westchase on the off chance she's at her NY home for the weekend?  But her server is in her NY home so just print there to begin with. But no, the maid was out and. Bill was at Epsteins island.  Or was Weiner to courier the printed emails  to DC so that Hillary can read them there. And if she is in Europe or China, then what?  She was the most traveled SOS in American history so how did she do her job with emails going to Weiner in NYC? Huma was always by her side when traveling, so she was not back at the office minding the store. So how was Huma to make use of her husband's  printer in NY for day to day business if she herself was not there to  receive the hard copies?  Comey wants us to believe that Hillary is so technologically inept that her daily communications had to flow thru torturous routes in order to land on her desk.  How I wish Trey Gowdy had been there to rip him a new one.

            Comey is an idiot. He knows there are soldiers in prison right now for merely taking a keepsake picture of the inside of a sub that no one saw. His answer right there to Sen. Cruz just gave permission for anyone to randomly transfer classified info to others who have no clearance and claim ignorance...utteraly ridiculous and against the law.
           </p>
           <p>
            Edit: I would like to explain my "idiot" response above. It is the only reasonable explanation one can assume without straight out calling him openly complicit. There is absolutely no way anyone can justify stating the Secretary of State can send classified emails on an unclassified server to her "aide Huma" who we have yet to confirm has a top secret clearance. Yet we know from Huma Abedin own 302 FBI testimony, when reviewing emails during the investigation the FBI showed her an alias used by President Obama and she stated "oh god that is classified"
           </p>
           <p>
            So Obama was sending classified email under an alias as well. And now we find out Huma was forwarding it to Anthony Weiner so he could "Print" it out. Are we supposed to be that stupid? Comey are you that unsophisticated or just blackmailed? Weiner has no clearance and Comey says "I don't think he read them" You Don't Think? Have you not had him in a small room with agents screaming in his face demanding answers? If you don't know he should be in custody or being tailed 24/7 and the very thought that he would be riding horses at some sex addict treatment center a few months ago makes the American people want to vomit?
           </p>
           <p>
            And just to clarify we are supposed to believe Huma Abedin forwarded classified emails from the Secretary of State of the United States of America to her pervert husband ( who had already been fired from his position in DC for sexting minors) forwarded the emails to him while he lived in NYC to "print them out" Did Huma hop in a jet every day and drop by NYC to pick them up at the printer? Do you seriously expect us to believe this? There are actual burn bags where documents have to be set on fire in many instances to protect National Security, but Anthony Weiner (known for sexting minors)could print out Classified United States Of America secrets in his NYC apartment.
           </p>
           <p>
            Why were search warrants not executed on Huma &amp; Anthony's apartment during the HRC investigation? Why was Anthony not interviewed? Why weren't search warrants executed on his apartment in October when NYPD had to tell you? How is it possible Director Comey you closed the case again within days? Do you know who Anthony could have talked to &amp;shared US secrets with?
           </p>
           <p>
            We will stop for now but this is an embarrassment to this nation. There are soldiers who have done literally nothing more than taken a keepsake photo and are in prison.
           </p>
           <p>
            There was more than enough intent shown in all these cases and even more was a reckless disregard for the law. The top laws that protect this country. How do we establish confidence in the justice system now!

             I am still feeling like an idiot because I can't figure out why Huma couldn't pop off to best buy and pick up her own damn printer, or order one from amazon or staples. Its just not that difficult. It almost like she was sending them to the Perv INTENTIONALLY

              The real story is more complicated than that as we all know. This involves high level espionage with blackberry servers being synced automatically and infiltrated by Pak. ISI spies called the Awan brothers.
             </p>
             <p>
              That is how ridiculous it all is. Comey either knows this and is completly blackmailed or so out of touch and legitimately believes his own BS. Which seems incredible that the FBI director would not be Davy enough to understand. So you would think he would come to the committee and say there are multiple highly classified investigations going on at this time. I am unable to comment due to National Security implications! Don't go on about fake Russia bullshit while pedophiles are harming children and many are government officials and say bogus info about Huma forwarding classified email to another pedo to "print" &amp; that is not a problem. That is enraging.

               I had forgotten about the blackberry spy swaps. But still the flimsy excuse of needing to "print" is nauseating, like we are stupid enough to fall for it, because the State Department cant afford a printer. I wish they drown in our puke.

                Agree. That is why it is even more nauseating. In reality there are blackberry spy swapping with Pak. ISI intel operatives &amp; on top of that they try to pretend the state dept. needs a new printer.
