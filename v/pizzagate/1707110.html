            Here's another article from today (3/9/2017) related to this new lawsuit against DA Charles Hynes:

            :)   “Hynes’ deliberate indifference towards [the boy’s] plight and failure to protect him was part of a policy, custom and practice of deliberate indifference towards witness tampering and intimidation of victims of pedophiles and their families within the ultra-Orthodox community,” says the suit filed in Brooklyn Federal Court.

            Okay.  Seems to me that this has a lot of good starting points on this issue of there being in place a lot of people who cover for these pedophiles.  Per this
            <em>
             Village Voice
            </em>
            article, the man suing former Brooklyn District Attorney
            <strong>
             Charles Hynes
            </strong>
            is
            <strong>
             Sam Kellner,
            </strong>
            father of a boy who was allegedly molested by a "notorious child molester" and RABBI named
            <strong>
             Baruch Lebovits
            </strong>
            .  Kellner worked with the investigation of Lebovits that resulted in Lebovits being convicted in 2010 (for actions against one victim, if I'm reading this right; a second victim who had come forward recanted under pressure allegedly; and the case of the third victim, Kellner's son, had not yet gone to trial) and sentenced to 10-1/2 to 32 years.  (As an aside, it looks like there was a measure of justice functioning in that Brooklyn court at that time anyway, which is somewhat comforting. I'm wondering if we shouldn't start a list of Judges We Think Can Be Trusted as well as a list of Judges We Think CANNOT Be Trusted.)  But within months of Lebovits's conviction, people connected to him, approach Brooklyn D.A. Charles Hynes and make accusations against Kellner.  During this time, Hynes "surreptitiously" drops the pending case against Lebovits regarding Kellner's son.  And in 2011, prosecutors in Hynes' office go after Kellner.  The next year, 2012, Lebovits' conviction is vacated on appeal due to a "prosecutorial error" (so these judges might be ones to add to the NOT trustworthy list, but we would want to read the appeal decision before coming to that conclusion) and HE IS RELEASED to house arrest.  In March of 2014, the charges against Kellner are dropped by Hynes's successor, the "late Ken Thompson". Thompson was the first black man elected as DA in Brooklyn.  Prior to that role, he was one of the prosecutors who convicted the NYPD officer who sodomized a Haitian immigrant with a stick in 1997 (
            <a href="http://www.newsday.com/news/new-york/funeral-held-for-brooklyn-s-top-prosecutor-ken-thompson-1.12459074">
             http://www.newsday.com/news/new-york/funeral-held-for-brooklyn-s-top-prosecutor-ken-thompson-1.12459074)
            </a>
            ).  According to this article, Thompson beat Hynes in a David-beats-Goliath fashion.  As Brooklyn D.A. he convicted a NYPD cop for shooting an innocent man in a darkened stairwell; he refused to prosecute low-level marijuana arrests; and he created a conviction-integrity unit (due to numerous allegations of his predecessors wrongfully convicting people and keeping them in jail) which unit exonerated 21 people.  See also this NYT article (
            <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/12/opinion/the-death-of-a-visionary-prosecutor.html?_r=0">
             https://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/12/opinion/the-death-of-a-visionary-prosecutor.html?_r=0)
            </a>
            ) which says this about Thompson and Hynes:  *In 2013 Mr. Thompson was elected as Brooklyn’s first black district attorney, beating out an entrenched incumbent, Charles Hynes, whose decades-long tenure had devolved into a stew of misconduct and corruption. *  Thompson was only in office for 34 months, then dies of cancer--at 50--just days after announcing that he would be getting treatment for cancer. Sounds a little suspicious to me, but that's a mystery for another time maybe.
           </p>
           <p>
            Back to Mr. Kellner's suit against Charles Hynes.  So Thompson beats Hynes in 2013 (November, presumably).  In March 2014, Thompson's office drops the case against Kellner.  A few months later, Lebovits pleads guilty in the case that had been vacated to avoid a second trial.  He goes to prison for an additional 86 days.  So that's less than two years (by my estimation) in prison for a "notorious child molester" who had been sentenced to 10-1/2 to 32 years.

            Here are the players from this
            <em>
             Village Voice
            </em>
            article whom we should be following up on:
            <strong>
             Arthur Aidala
            </strong>
            , the attorney for Lebovits who also was a long-time Hynes backer;
            <strong>
             John Lonuzzi
            </strong>
            , attorney for the recanting victim;
            <strong>
             Avraham Lehrer (aka Joe Levin)
            </strong>
            , a private investigator who alleged that he had proof that someone was paid off to go after Kellner;
            <strong>
             Moshe Friedman
            </strong>
            , "a Hasidic power broker" who was working to help Lebovits.  We should also pull the Federal Complaint on this case, if we can, and read it in full to see the full scope of the allegations.

            Unless Lebovits himself had tons of cash, why would other wealthy people kick in to raise enough funds to change a 10-32 year sentence into only apparently 2 years or less inside? i think we know why.  Btw, as much as people dislike lawyers, lawsuits such as this can shed light where it needs it
