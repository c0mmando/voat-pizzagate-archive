<p>The “big tits at school” obviously got my interest … A grown man with children and grandchildren is into “bit tits at school”?</p>
<p>Sender: Elan-pizzurr@CBYON.COM</p>
<p>I first researched the website mentioned in the email, www.foaliatq.com, on Google and got these previews:</p>
<p><a href="https://beta.groups.yahoo.com/neo/groups/.../messages?...2379...:">https://beta.groups.yahoo.com/neo/groups/.../messages?...2379...:</a> Google says access to site is not secure (I did not visit it).</p>
<p>“You better ensure you have your long range artillery serviced when you enter the sex combat zone”</p>
<p>“Hassle-free, guaranteed gains in length and girth are possible now”</p>
<p>“They will worship your body after 2 months of herbal supplements”</p>
<p>“Help wanted fine actors looking for plausible ass”</p>
<p>“Want a better lovemaking experience, visit our website here now”</p>
<p>The website itself does not seem to exist anymore. I could not find a WHOIS registry. Does anyone have an idea to get hold of previous content or more info?</p>
<p>Next, I researched the sender’s URL – www.bcyon.com:</p>
<p>It’s the “Huntington West Virginia Law Firm”
Haven’t looked into them yet.</p>
<p>Then I looked up the sender, Elan-pizzurr:</p>
<p>At first, I couldn’t find anything, but then I searched for the last name and the company this person is working with, and this came up:
Her real name seems to be Eileen Pizzurro.</p>
<p>On Google, there were three links to Pinterest when entering “pizzurr bcyon”, but the pages would not open (I don’t have an account – can anyone try, please?). The preview text is about children – again.</p>
<p>Questions: Who is Eileen Pizzuro? I think we need more information on her. Also, why would she send such a message to John Podesta? Google also gives me a link when entering her name plus “Alefantis”, but the site won’t open. Help, please!</p>',

            I would tend to dismiss this as spam, if it weren't for the fact that the text of the message does not match the subject. I think this must be a coded message. (I think we would know if Podesta's emails contained ordinary spam. I've seen no evidence of this.)

              Do not let go of it that quick.  spine clinic computer imaging for hospitals.  I just read today on here...I have been at this all day do not remember.  There was a case somewhere in Ca. where JP was connected to two old people dying due to some medical device testing.  Please someone look this up.  I must attend to some things, if I have time I will try to look too. Don't give up yet.

                Don't feel stupid.  I have come so close many times.  This will cause us sometimes to take risks when we should not.  Remember we are doing this for the Kids.  That is why we sometimes take a step too far.  Stay Strong and Keep Fighting.
