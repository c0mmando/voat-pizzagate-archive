<p>&quot;Sacrificing a chicken to Moloch. This may be taken literally, though I personally suspect it\'s a pedophilia code where chicken means child, in which case it may be referring to child sacrifice. Either way, the line is an apparent reference to Moloch, a favorite god of Satanism and a Canaanite god associated with child sacrifice. Moloch is the deity worshiped at Bohemian Grove as a giant 40 foot owl. </p>
<p>&quot;Even if you don\'t believe that, the very fact that people are gathered around in secret worshiping dark forces and deliberately trying to destroy the compassion, empathy and love inside of themselves (&quot;cremate care&quot;) is a very disturbing reality – especially when you consider these are the people running our world.&quot; </p>

            My view is that #PizzaGate is about gathering evidence of wrongdoing, mainly involving pedophiles. Being a part of "Satanic" (or Luciferianist) Occult isn't against the law. It's not until it's put into some sort of action of kidnapping, killing, torturing, sexually abusing, etc. that it becomes problematic. So yes, this has more to do with the pedophiles than then the Occult, but the Occult may be a piece of the puzzle.
