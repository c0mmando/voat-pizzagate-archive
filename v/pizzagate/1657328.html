            Late welcome.  I was warned (by a fellow Voater) when joining Voat that it was 'marine standard'; unrelenting and unapologetic in it's judgement if you f@@@ up.  I can attest to this!  Tread carefully lol

            Some history about the camp:
           </p>
           <p>
            In 1926 Reverend Mrs. Ollie Bradley and her husband purchased Ernest Trosper's 800 acre Bear Pen Creek ranch and began their religious Truth Sect community on the property that became known as the Truth Home. After earlier visits to Ernie's ranch Ollie had a divine vision that this was the only impending doomsday safe place in the world as foretold in the Bible's book of Revelations (chapter 7). Ollie believed that she was God's chosen one to lead her followers, World War I veterans and their families, to this safe place. Ollie kept her flock somewhat isolated on the ranch compound and the only outside news was provided by her... and it was only the bad news kind that reinforced her doomsday preaching. One day in 1940 one of the men had a heart attack and died while milking a cow. Information was leaking to the residents that world events were not as bad as Ollie was teaching and they were becoming aware that they were being used to build and maintain her own little utopia. The man's death was enough for them to flee the Truth compound, and they did so in a hurry. They were not going to spend restricted &amp; false directed lives working for Mrs. Bradley any longer. Many of their personal belongings were left behind giving one the impression that the "Rapture" had suddenly taken place. (Ollie at least didn't have her followers practice "drinking the Kool Aid!") She sold her property to the General Council of Congregational Christian Churches (CCC) in 1946. It was then used as a church Boy and Girl Scout camp. In 1957, after church mergers, the camp's name was changed from Cazadero's Christian Congregational Church Camp (CCC CAMP) to the United Church of Christ Camp (UCC Camp).

            I posted this on a similar thread: I am in the building design industry. I can tell u that the structure is buried. The earlier photos indicate an inflated roof system to both keep water out and conceal the work being done below. It is a taller roof to accommodate the larger back hoes and excavators. As the hole is completed the temporary roof is lowered to a lower version (perhaps rigid system) since the work below no longer requires heavy equipment. The lower temporary roof makes it less conspicuous . Once the subterranean structure is finished out and the water proofing system on permanent roof is complete..the dirt covers up permanent roof and temporary roof is removed and no one is the wiser. If someone really wanted to find out one could dig into building permits released during 2011 in local county. From that point responsible parties could be determined. I should note a contractor to do that job would need to be fairly reputable since a subterranean structure that large would need serious expertise and engineering, and water proofing. Reputable architects and engineers would definitely be required as well. 
  Lastly I should note that during the time the earliest photos were taken (2011), the "underground mansion prepper bunkers" were starting to get a buzz around the internet growing in popularity with millionaires  etc.  It would stand to reason that this construction is one of those and a building permit would probably indicate this.  This theory would also align with the notion of it being a "pizza mansion" if the tag is true.  So whoever tagged it would likely be able to say it is an extravagant underground domicile with pizza related operations...hence "Pizza Mansion".  Again this rumor could easily be proven or debunked by researching the local building permits that were issued during 2011.  If the permit links back to a Podesta related LLC then there is definitely smoke here to be suspicious of.

              If it was hauled out then they had to use something (forklift, backhoe, loader) to load the dirt into the truck. As well, there had to have been space for them to manoeuvre. A (or several) wheelbarrow(s) will not work here. If it were underground, then the dirt would have to go 'uphill' to get out of the portal. Perhaps a quad (with trailer) for extraction and ? to load it into the truck... or a need for the dirt on a different part of the same property.

               They could have had the loader(s) parked along one side and the backhoes/excavators dropping dirt into the loaders from one side of the tent.  If the tent was tall enough this would have been possible, and the pictures indicate that the initial tent was pretty tall.  After hole is dug and heavy equipment not needed they could have driven up the the heavy equipment up a ramp. The rest of the dirt could have been pulled out with excavator from above rim.

                I'm with you. The only part I have a problem with is how they got the dirt into the buckets. I may be totally wrong here, but I am imagining a portal which something is bringing the dirt out of. As per your comment, perhaps they could've excavated and then back-filled on top of the structure. Makes sense.

            I just don't think I can believe this guys "Anonymous source' that she and only she found his Pizza Mansion labeled on google earth and then before she could alert everyone online to see for themselves it was removed. Why did she wait so damn long to come forward? Doesn't make sense

            Anyone could have posted that "Pizza Mansion" comment. It's kind of laughable people are getting excited over something anyone could have typed in there. It's possible
            <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/v/Pizzagate">
             /v/Pizzagate
            </a>
            could lose a lot of credibility if we follow such tenuous leads.
           </p>
           <p>
            But I'll admit it's possible some CTR troll put the "Podesta Pizza Mansion" there to introduce doubt about the entire site. Yes that is definitely possible. Let's not jump to any conclusions too quickly. That's all I'm saying.
           </p>
           <p>
            Oh shit, I'm sounding like

            . Truth be told he was right about 20% of the time so it's a wash. There are times when legitimate skepticism makes sense.

              "Get the fuck out of here".....I appreciate your skepticism. I've done what you just did to many people here. Most of the time I'm right about shill's sometimes I'm not.

              So TreborPJ, I'm not offended at all. We're all really really fucking mad at what happened in this country. It went to shit real fast, faster than I ever imagined it could.

             Three possibilities with regard to the PPM: a larp, a purposeful distraction, or a whistleblower. I think whoever first pointed this out to the pizza(pedo)gate investigation needs to be checked into to make a more informed decision on which of the three are the most likely. Having had temporary construction there could mean anything and it is really easy to read my bias into it. So... Who found this originally????

              "a larp, a purposeful distraction, or a whistleblower"......I'd add another one to that list given George Webb's theory on LionsGate and Frank Guistra. What is that item?
             </p>
             <p>
              "de-weaponizing evidence"
             </p>
             <p>
              Lionsgate made the Whistleblower to de-weaponize the crimes of Dyncorp in Kosovo, Serbia, Croatia etc. Making a movie allows you to say "Oh you poor deplorable shit lord, there is no human trafficking epidemic. You've watched The Whistleblower one too many times."
             </p>
             <p>
              So people will go to Google Earth and see that "Podesta's Pizza Mansion" and think "Of course! Some deplorable shit lord was trolling Google Earth to connect it to Pizzagate. God these deplorable shit lords are crazy.".

              This guy says in the video that the source is "Majestic Angel." Is that the name he gave her or the name she chose? Is it a play on Majestic Ape? Or a tell? Interesting choice of name, considering.

            I know you are kidding, sort of. But do be careful.  I heard an interview with Ole Dammegard recently in which he said his informant said these type of places where they hold kids were wired with electricity that was always kept at a low charge.  If some one tried to escape or to interfere they would flip the switch and it would go instantly to full charge.  A person would experience it as feeling sick (low) to dead (full).  They said look for a circle of burnt grass which is were the feed is kept on low at all times.

            I am updating my comment to verify that I can recreate the results of the YouTube informant using the History function of Google Earth.  This means to me that there was either a temporary grow industry or an underground building going on. 1/2011 Seems to be the earliest image of a structure.  The inflatable roof structure changes back and forth until 3/2015 when it is gone, leaving seemingly plain ground exposed.  Although no image seemed to have dirt piles or earth moving equipment, the final image on 3/2015 seems to have a rectangular area that could possibly be a hatch.

            Totally will upvoat this. So they built something underground. It's why they had that tarp covering. The roof was probably a temporary structure. If they were taking things into the underground area, they'd have to have a structure so the tarp wouldn't interfere and keep it raised.

             Dirt. Where's the dirt? If earth was removed from underground, there had to have been a. a way to transport it out, b. large enough entry portal but small enough to remain hidden, and c. dirt removal. Could've been removed with quads or trucks. As well, materials to reinforce the underground structure would be placed close to the entrance. Find the dirt. Perhaps a permit for excavation depending on the state.

             Underground construction makes a lot of sense. But look at all the piles of wood more recently. With enough donors couldn't they afford building one time use "mansion" for their satanic shit. 
I wonder who built/deconstructed this mansion during these four years...

                The last bit of information I remember reading from hawaii anon was that he was hightailing it, and being followed through the airport. I saw this secondhand and can't comment on the validity of it.
               </p>
               <p>
                That was 100% a great lead. As far as I remember it seemed like we just couldn't turn anything else up. I know I spent hours and came up with nothing much to add. I believe he was also linked or at least knew about the "Fred" something youtube account, selling NON-FUNCTIONING HDDs for good prices. I do not know of any value those HDDs would have had if they did not actually have files on them.
