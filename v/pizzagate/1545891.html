            Barack Obama Helps Pizzagate Investigation, Declares January "Human Trafficking Awareness Month"
           </h1>
           <p>
            Just a few weeks before leaving office Barack Obama has declared January 2017 "Human Trafficking Awareness Month". The "Blue Campaign" is a collaboration the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), ICE, USCIS and CBP and will feature many informational events starting on January 10 (
            <a href="https://www.dhs.gov/blue-campaign/events">
             https://www.dhs.gov/blue-campaign/events)
            </a>
            ). This campaign comes on the heels of the largest citizen investigation ever mounted on the Internet, a wide ranging effort colloquially referred to as #pizzagate. In early december, all major news outlets seized on pizzagate to complain about the "fake news" phenomenon. "Fake news" is the process by which purposely false articles with very catchy titles get shared on Facebook much faster, and more often than real news. Many news outlets who are directly related to the recurring characters of the pizzagate investigation are stuck between a rock and a hard place these days being exposed for collusion with the DNC while they continue to lose credibility with the general public.
           </p>
           <p>
            Illicit traficking of children for sex is the fastest growing industry in America after drugs. However, it has been impossible to obtain credible statistics related to arrests of child trafickers. Over the last decade, scant progress has been made to stop this industry in the U.S. However, in Australia, Canada and Norway, the FBI has helped arrest people involved in the trading of child porn, which is often the end product of child traficking. It is estimated that over 50% of child porn is produced in the U.S. where 1 child out of every 92 goes missing every year. The community of independent researchers trying to crack this nut have uncovered massive discrepencies in data related to missing children. For instance, the Center for Missing and Exploited Children shows that 5 times more children go missing in Virginia than all other states. Further research indicated that the only person assigned to this process makes it a point to enter all missing children. This is one of many findings of the thousands strong unpaid research group that will require further investigation and, perhaps, greater funding from "The Blue Campaign". Additionally, the Washington D.C. police department has refused to look into allegations of suspiscious activities by businesses on the corner of Nebraska and Connecticut Avenue leaving investigators frustrated. As a side note of historical interest, most of the businesses on this corner (which sits exactly on one point of the inverted Baphomet pentagram celebrating the Luciferian desing of l'Enfant) are owned by very close friends of Hillary Clinton and John Podesta, including the Comet Ping Pong eatery which was the scene of a peculiar shooting incident on Dec 4, 2016 when the city's surveillance camera was conveniently turned away.
           </p>
           <p>
            It was the FBI who boldly rang the alarm in July 2015 when assistant director of the FBI's Criminal Investigative Division Joseph Campbell said "The level of pedophilia is just unprecedented right now. We have so many cases constantly of individuals in all walks of life, from the very wealthy … to all other levels engaged in child pornography, child exploitation … it just seems to be almost an at epidemic level." He went on to add that these are mostly American kids, not necessarily undocumented youths who cross the border illegally. This is rather shocking given that, in 2016, tens of thousands of unaccompanied minors spent time in ICE custody before being released to American family members or foster homes.
           </p>
           <p>
            It is unknown at this time if the FBI, DHS and ICE will be able to increase its force to investigate ALL cases reported to them. So far ressources have been stretched and investigation cut short such as in the case of the 1,700 Pentagon employees who were found to have used their office computer to purchase child porn online. In the end, the investigation was cut short and only 22 people were disciplined. In the age of social media, where sex trafickers use Instagram, Youtube, Twitter and Facebook to connect rather openly, random people are becoming incensed that there is no way for them to report offenders. In one case, users who uncovered and published over 10,000 accounts of Twitter peedophiles were unceremoniously banned from the platform. The offending accounts remain. Independent child advocates who research this topic are often labelled crazy conspiracy nuts, or simply Trump supporters, by media pundits. This has bolstered support for Donald Trump in this largely unpartisan group of men and women from all over the world who hope President-Elect will make good on his 2012 (TWEET) promise to swiftly deal with sexual deviants. The online community cheered Trump's quick action to stop the lame duck congress from gutting the Ethics Commitee on WHEN?!
