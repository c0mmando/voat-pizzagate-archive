            Hi, newfriend. Rule 2 of
            <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/v/pizzagate">
             v/pizzagate
            </a>
            states that all posts need at least one weblink relevant to the post, and that any claims of fact which are not common knowledge must be backed by a link.  Pls fix and repost.  Thx.
           </p>
           <p>
            P.S. If the site doesn't allow a particular link, simply put a space in the beginning of the link.

            A year ago you tried to convince people to put themselves in a compromising position, by suggesting that "someone who lives nearby to comet pizza should investigate this person", interestingly, your thread no longer has any indication whatsoever as to who "this person" is or was at the time...
           </p>
           <p>
            Now you're back with a copy-paste clearly from or intended for reddit, wherein you repeat the word conspiracy 4 times, 3 in a single paragraph, regarding elsagate and how we simply must spend more time on it...
           </p>
           <p>
            Maybe I'm wrong, I hope I am, but, it's starting to look like you're literally only here to waste everyone's time and send legitimate people on goose chases that lead nowhere.

           <hr/>
           <p>
            The elsagate videos and the people involved in their creation/dissemination are indeed, fucked in the head, but, it's not something to become totally hung up on.

            Didn't the channel get taken down? That's what I last heard. Joe Rogan went off on his podcast ranting about it and YouTube removed it..
