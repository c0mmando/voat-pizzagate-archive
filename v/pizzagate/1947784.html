<p>It all started for me when I was watching an alleged victim of child ritual and sexual abuses Youtube Channel. His name is David Shurter. I can\'t uphold any of his claims, but they were interesting nonetheless. He happened to mention a group of child abductors almost as a side comment in the video, and they were (and are still) called the Finders. The Finders appear to be a group of adults heavily involved with the CIA who operate all over the United States. Their primary goal is to abduct children and traffick them around the country. If you haven\'t heard of the Finders, I would highly suggest you start doing some research on the group. It can get very disturbing, but knowledge is power and we need everything we can get to bring an end to the madness.</p>
<p>After several frantic and depressing days of over indulging in Finders research, I came across a man who has become almost a legend to me by the name of Ted Gunderson. Mr Gunderson was the head of the FBI\'s Los Angeles division several decades back, before going into the private sector and investigating many interesting cases. A lot of which are in the area of child trafficking and ritual abuse. Unfortunately Mr Gunderson passed away before the pizzagate scandal sent us all into a research frenzy, which is too bad considering he would of been a phenomenal asset. Once again, I would highly suggest researching Ted Gundersons\' investigations. I would suggest starting with the Mcmartin Preschool case in Southern California. Gunderson has some excellent video presentations you can find on Youtube which can run several hours long, but are well worth watching.</p>
<p>This finally brings me to the Franklin Cover Up, and holy shit what a cover up it is. I would almost say it is the biggest and most controversial cover up of all time. The investigation was lead by a Nebraska state senator named John De Camp. De Camp was a total badass. He brought the case to court and fought tooth and nail to bring the child abuse atrocities to light. I also was very lucky to find a PDF version of the book De Camp wrote which summed up the investigation for free online. There is a link to the PDF below. This isn\'t an easy rabbit hole to get out of once you\'re in, and I hope you all the best in your research. I would also like to apologize if this is old news to most, but I would of found myself lucky to come across this information last year when I knew little to nothing about these things. Thanks for reading.</p>

             Yes, and that's why Alex Jones has cited Gunderson probably a hundred times by my reckoning. But then why would CIA agent Jones mention Gunderson and De Camp so often? And for that matter, why would Gunderson and De Camp go on the Alex Jones show? You do know that both men went on Jones's show multiple times, don't you? It does not make any sense, unless Jones is not CIA. But why you would want to destroy the legacy of Gunderson and De Camp by suggesting they were dupes? Are you really smarter than the legendary Ted Gunderson?

             The Finders might just be the creepiest thing I've ever researched. I think they are a very important piece, at least historically, in the puzzle we all find ourselves putting together.
            </p>
            <p>
             The material is incredibly dark, and will reveal one of the facets in the workings of the child trafficking industry. I always heard talk of white vans being sketchy while growing up, but after researching the Finders I will never look at a white van the same. I'd be curious to know if Bonacci was working with the Finders when he allegedly aided in the abduction of Johnny Gosch.

              It's almost too much to bear. I can't believe any of us are still here wiling to look at this abject evil.

               As Liz Crokin makes clear, even she didn't realize how "rampant" human trafficking/child trafficking really is.

               That's why we're all here: 
 in hopes of finding/doing something that will aid in bringing these children home and deliver them from harm.

            I was around for Franklin. READ THE BOOKs on it.  They're both chock full of info.  (I'm partial to DeCamp's.)  Unfortunately, John is older now, in poor health, and uninvolved.

            Ted discovered the tunnels under McMartin school after they were declared officially "nonexistent."  Alex Constantine did a great writeup on this.

            Ted was a hero.  Sadly, his legacy has been spoiled by the satanists.  (You will find all kinds of posthumous garbage about him online.)  They murdered him with arsenic.

            MANY MANY PEOPLE HAVE DIED trying to expose this evil.  I have known people who have been assassinated, so I LMAO at you idiots believing the PHONY "they're after me!" stories.

            Kathleen Sorenson was a foster mother in Nebraska who started her own campaign -- sort of like a Noreen Gosch (Johnny Gosch/Jeff Gannon's mother).  She was a very prominent figure, appearing all over PBS in Nebraska.  She died in a fatal hit-and-run MVA after satanists ran her off a Nebraska highway.

            In the 80s and 90s, the "satanic panic" bullshit meme was put out by TPTB to kill the new awareness of these activities.  They had their pro shills trotted out on national TV, therapists and shrinks who declared that all these children suffered from "false memory syndrome" and that none of it was true.  Now we know that the CIA founded the False Memory Syndrome Foundation for just this purpose.

             Two of Alex Jones's favorite guests were Ted Gunderson and John De Camp. Both men were inteviewed multiple times, and Jones has mentioned Gunderson (and the Franklin Coverup) perhaps a hundred times by my reckoning. So, if Gunderson and De Camp respected Jones, and you have high regard for Gunderson and De Camp, then why do you so wish to destroy Jones? Are you really smarter than Gunderson and De Camp? If either man were speaking to you directly and said I would like you to stop your attacks on someone I trust, how would you respond?
