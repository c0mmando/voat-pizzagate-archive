            Wrong David Seaman.  I would've thought this was an honest mistake, but instead I think you're a sick fuck for using by-the-book smears against people pointing out your error.  You shame your mother, shill.

             David Seaman is a pedophile, what the fuck are you talking about? Are you a pedophile trying to protect your own kind?
            </p>
            <p>
             Perverts like David Seaman must be crucified. Why would anyone defend this man?
            </p>
            <p>
             A PERVERT who lied about his history of sex offending to get a job with an engineering firm has been jailed for two years. When David Seaman, of Lower Westwood, was again arrested for having indecent pictures of children, his third set of sex offences, his bosses and colleagues learned of his seedy past. Now the 49-year-old is back behind bars after a judge jailed him for two years for the latest bout of offending. Hannah Squire, prosecuting, told Swindon Crown Court on Friday that in 2011, the year after his release from prison, he gave a CV to C&amp;D Recruitment omitting his criminal past. Three years later, in 2014, police got information about people accessing a particular website with one of the users living at Seaman’s address. They went to the house and seized his computer equipment, which contained 177 indecent images of children, mostly girls aged between five and 12. She said he had also put ‘the usual terms’ used to look for the material into search engines and when he was questioned admitted what he had done. “The images appear to have been collected over a fairly long period of time, just after his release from a previous sentence in June 2010,” she said. On his computers police also found software for wiping the history, which had been used to cover up much of what he had been up to online. Ms Squire said he had been receiving a salary for a job which he would not have received if he had told the truth about his past. Seaman admitted deception, possessing indecent images of children and three counts of making them. He gave the court an address at West View Farm, Lower Westwood, Bradford on Avon, where he had rented a flat until June 1 this year. Seaman, who was not represented by a lawyer, told the court why, saying: “I am guilty so I don’t think I should waste their time.” Jailing him, Judge Tim Mousley QC said: “To your credit the pre-sentence report indicates that you are motivated to change you ways now. “I very much hope that is not a false dawn. There have been previous occasions when you have attempted to do this but not succeeded.”

              It's sick you come in here trying to confuse people with a completely unrelated person that has absolutely nothing to do with Pizzagate who has the same name to cover the tracks of real pedophiles.

              You're well aware David Seaman is promoting Pizzagate on YouTube and Gab and you're butthurt so you're here trying to spread disinformation.

               Dude as if EVERY FRICKING JEW was into sacrifice since cradle.PLEASE. Do you think every Jewish person without exception is into nefarious activities. Is this your proposal here?
David Seaman has made more people aware of pizzagate than anybody reading this thread. 
At least we can cognitively say that.
And about your previous ridiculous proposition, it is false and nothing but a distraction. To say that I have met normal Jews in my life sounds almost silly. But I have.

             Its ok because the jewish pedophiles only molest goyim children, so long as no jewish child is harmed who gives a fuck.
Pizzagate is a real problem here in Ireland, that why I wanted everyone to know about David Seaman.

            <p>
             WHat do you think pizzagate is all about its Jewish pedophiles making sure that investigation of Pedophiles is only done by Kosher Investigators.
            </p>
            <p>
             Our mods here on Voat are 100% kosher investigators. Should we find a goyiim child to fuck or decide to call any goyim we wish a pedophile so be it, for we are the chosenites.
            </p>
            <p>
             You dare call anybody with a jewish name a pedophile we will ban you and delete your posts.

               David Seaman is a pedophile, what the fuck are you talking about? Are you a pedophile trying to protect your own kind?
              </p>
              <p>
               Perverts like David Seaman must be crucified.
              </p>
              <p>
               A PERVERT who lied about his history of sex offending to get a job with an engineering firm has been jailed for two years.
When David Seaman, of Lower Westwood, was again arrested for having indecent pictures of children, his third set of sex offences, his bosses and colleagues learned of his seedy past.
Now the 49-year-old is back behind bars after a judge jailed him for two years for the latest bout of offending.
Hannah Squire, prosecuting, told Swindon Crown Court on Friday that in 2011, the year after his release from prison, he gave a CV to C&amp;D Recruitment omitting his criminal past.
Three years later, in 2014, police got information about people accessing a particular website with one of the users living at Seaman’s address.
They went to the house and seized his computer equipment, which contained 177 indecent images of children, mostly girls aged between five and 12.
She said he had also put ‘the usual terms’ used to look for the material into search engines and when he was questioned admitted what he had done.
“The images appear to have been collected over a fairly long period of time, just after his release from a previous sentence in June 2010,” she said.
On his computers police also found software for wiping the history, which had been used to cover up much of what he had been up to online.
Ms Squire said he had been receiving a salary for a job which he would not have received if he had told the truth about his past.
Seaman admitted deception, possessing indecent images of children and three counts of making them. He gave the court an address at West View Farm, Lower Westwood, Bradford on Avon, where he had rented a flat until June 1 this year.
Seaman, who was not represented by a lawyer, told the court why, saying: “I am guilty so I don’t think I should waste their time.”
Jailing him, Judge Tim Mousley QC said: “To your credit the pre-sentence report indicates that you are motivated to change you ways now.
“I very much hope that is not a false dawn. There have been previous occasions when you have attempted to do this but not succeeded.”

                Don't play dumb. It's sick you come in here trying to confuse people with a completely unrelated person that has the same name to cover the tracks of real pedophiles.

                You're well aware David Seaman is promoting Pizzagate on YouTube and Gab and you're butt hurt so you're here trying to spread disinformation. 
Fuck off.
