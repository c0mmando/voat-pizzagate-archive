            <p>
             But couldn't you hypothetically use your sledgehammer to create a passage way into the tunnel itself? Hey, I don't know. Just a guess.
            </p>
           </blockquote>
           <p>
            That's the thing it's hypothetical.  And I think you would need a jackhammer because it looks like where they stopped was an original stone wall of the tunnel.  A story on Le Boudoir, said that place was originally filled with exposed pipes you had to duck under to move around and they had to dig out some more  to lower the floor so they could built it into that space.
           </p>
           <p>
            And remember since it's a sealed tunnel, you would have to find other location and break through a diffierent wall underneath this second location if actually wanted to move from place to place.   So my question has always been  To What End?   There's just simply easier, cheaper ways to get that goal.
           </p>
           <p>
            If the original building had three underground levels and it was such a big conspiracy that whole building was in on it, why not just set up the bottom room for your needs? You just get a van and take a night drive from the docks to the parking garage of that building.  And voila, you're done.
           </p>

            And Brooklyn and Manhattan have been part of the same city since 1898.  To this day, however people will often still say "I'm going to the city" when they mean going into Manhattan and they are probably gone now, but there were old signs in the subway that pointed "To the City" well into my lifetime.
           </p>
           <p>
            They are still digging tunnels today.  The second Ave Subway line just opened and the subway that runs cross town to Times Square was just extended to a new stop on 11th Ave

            Hmmmm ....they never suspected that the tunnel was built into the neighboring basement.
           </p>
           <p>
            Where have I heard that before? Oh, that's right! It's some wild conspiracy theory that could never happen because it doesn't exist. Obviously, the video is fake news ... according to people who still don't want to believe what's right there for them to discover. Thanks for the interesting footage.

            Love your direction of research Gilderoy, this is absolutely fascinating.  I find it extremely puzzling that there appears to be so many disused tunnel systems throughout the US, however their existence seems to be hushed up. It leads to the question "why?"

            New Yorkers will remember the tours of the Atlantic Avenue Tunnel given by Bob Diamond, where you’d literally hop down into a manhole near Trader Joe’s. Those tours were shut down but you can get a glimpse of a portion of that tunnel today through Le Boudoir.  I wonder why those tours were shut down?  Hmm.  Possibly for another use?  I believe there are parts of those tunnels in use for the trafficking of children and others for slaves.and organ harvesting later maybe.  The elite are a disgusting lot.  Thank You. Great and Entertaining Post.

             Nice use of the Brooklyn Eagle!   When you come to Kings County to investigate all this, you can get some great Pizza right near Le Boudoir.   I forgot about Luzzo's BK.   Not as good as the original location in Manhattan which might be the best pizza in NYC, but hey it's just steps from your tunnel.

             carmencita have you been to that Trader Joe's?  Because then we have just two links of separation, if so.
            </p>
            <p>
             The reason they shut down the tunnels is he teamed with a film group and was doing movie screenings in the tunnel and the Fire Department thought this was a terrible idea.

              I believe there are parts of those tunnels in use for the trafficking of children and others for slaves.and organ harvesting later maybe.

             Why do you believe that?

             Gilderoy, how much do believe this as an actual possiblity?   Is this just a parlour game of what if for you?   Or do you believe the Le Boudouir story actually supports this idea?  Because I think the idea that you need to have someone tell you about rumors of access and then break through a wall and create your entrance not to the full tunnel, but a cozy bar-sized room supports my contention.   Because all this gives you is a super-cool basement,  it's not entering one place and exiting another.   It's just a space.    You don't need tunnels for that.

            Ah, the early 1930s.  With Prohibition in place, the Jewish mafia rose to all-time heights, ran amok, and made a FORTUNE.  (Which is why Prohibition was enacted in the first place.)
