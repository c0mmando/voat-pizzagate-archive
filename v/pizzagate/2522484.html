What links do the Clintons have with Jean-Bertrand Aristide, and Raoul Cédras?
           </p>
           <p>
            HRC Brother Tony Rodham owns gold mining rights in Haiti. Frank Giustra, Carlos Slim and the Clintons, ran a microloan sharking service in Haiti that drove women into prostitution, selling their children into slavery, and even selling their organs on the black market.
           </p>
           <p>
            Why did the Clinton Global Initiative flood the Haitian economy with peanuts and cotton, post Earthquake, something that was a cash crop and was already in great abundance of in the country? To bankrupt farmers?
           </p>
           <p>
            Why is George Soros seen in Haiti with Clinton?
           </p>
           <p>
            Why did they build a state of the art hospital in the middle of no where next to an airport?

            Yes, I agree.  But I hope we  all recognize that many 'journalists' and 'bloggers' come to sites like ours for much of their information too.  Just by putting the pieces together here on voat and constantly revisiting the best archived threads and linking with today's information is an invaluable service in and of itself.  Make no mistake, many people watch Voat.

             and I have talked many times and posted here about how we have noticed the Daily Mail and others surprisingly coming out with an article right after we have posted one with similar content.  This happened not to long ago with Heather O'Rourke.  I truthfully believe that we have done much to Red Pill the Masses.  I have said many times that all those replies you see to JP and his Tweets surely did not come about because they were woken up  by the MSM.  Yes,  we have done a great job and yes, they look to us really I believe as their diggers.   We should get some credit, but at this point I am just elated that it is sinking in.

                Many of us do write articles when we do a post here.  Also when we post in the comments it is as if in a blog.  We pour our hearts out many times.  Also we do hard research and post it here and spend hours many times, doing their work.  I am just saying that it would be nice.  Not a demand, just a thought or a request and I believe that we did get a response and a mention I think in steemit.  I don't need to see my name in print.  I am not like that.
