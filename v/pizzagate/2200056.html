            Gay men will tell you they are very uncomfortable with the idea of transitioning before one is at least 18. Dangerous to do surgery before one is fully and completely grown.
           </p>
           <p>
            In some cultures it's preferable for a child to be a trans girl than to be a gay boy.  Or a boy may temporarily over identify with his sisters as he also likes to play music, draw, design doll's clothes rather than play sports with his brothers. Conversely a "tom-boy" may still be 100% straight female.
           </p>
           <p>
            Sexuality discussions like religion do not belong being discussed at school There's a hornet's nest of problems with either. What all young children should be taught instead is that not everyone thinks or believes the exact same thing. Then show them what the "average" child eats for breakfast in various countries around the world.  Train them it's not considered polite to criticize another's choices. End of subject.

            This is why we can't give up trying to stop as many of these creeps as we can. So future generations can have hope. The task is huge, beyond one person's grasp. Is everything on this site being archived? Shouldn't we also be working on catching and filming satanic rituals and sacrifice? Project Veritas  has asked for ideas for undercover films. Stay strong folks.

            Please see this thread. This drag queen's links and videos are going to be found by these children in the library. It is appalling that children would be exposed to this. Fire that librarian!!!

            The Cabal/NWO, whatever you want to call the small group of wealthy luciferian pedophile families that have been controlling the world behind the scenes for thousands of years, will use ANY minority and WEAPONIZE it/them/us and create division. This is necessary because there are more of us than there are of them. They know this and fear it greatly. Our Unity is poison to them, it is their demise.

             I have a lesbian couple as friends. So it's not that I don't like gay people. What I have a problem with is that someone's sexual preferences shouldn't be pushed on others or glorified. I think the schools should butt out. That's not their place. Whatever someone wants to do in the bedroom is their business.

             Just read today a claim he was disbarred possibly due to drugs. That he attended college as a foreign student as there was a bigger scholarship program offered then for those born in the US. That his heritage was actually Indonesian and Muslim, not from Kenya. So many tales. Whose to know what's true? I have always wanted to see proof either way.

            If u go on social media u will most likely be bombarded with transgender crap in your face with the worst of it being constant videos of prepubescent young boys doing makeup tutorials with caked on makeup and fake eyelashes talking about how great they look and feel. U just can’t get away from it, YouTube, Instagram, it’s everywhere.

            As usual you prove that RACE does not enter into your consideration, even in a post about POPULATION control.  That makes you a defective human being, a product of Jewish brainwashing (you probably think they're white).
           </p>
           <p>
            ALL this faggotry is much more common in WHITES.  it is clearly one of OUR genetic defects, which I ascribe to the relative sluttiness of white women whose sex drive is transferred to the son.

                Your alcoholism is the fault of the Jews, too, and your kids contend with "kill whitey day" at public schools that Jews integrated.

                You obviously are totally oblivious to the fact that your entire life is an unnatural Jewish sabotage plot, your experiences completely different to your parents', your cultural icons were mere tools, your only cultural practice is BBQ on football Sunday where your menfolk release testosterone VICARIOUSLY and ignore the problems we face as a people.

              It's worse than evil, it's ignorance.   A very wise man told us not to make religions out of certain truths he learned because if given to the uninitiated it will be misinterpreted (Do not cast pearls before swine).  The past two thousand years has been the result of that mistake.   People disenfranchised with religion end up renouncing God thinking they are one in the same and that's the Lucifarian trick.

            Voat will not let me submit this but it's relevant and there is some movement to punish this aberrant behaviour.

            One thing is clear; the globalist agenda requires a much smaller population to achieve sustainability. Short of wars and plagues, that leaves birth control. You will not hear it openly endorsed by globalists, but there are indications sustainability is what is driving the accept-alternative-sexuality agenda. The rest is for public consumption.

               Unfortunately there are not many links about the Pilgrims Society for example, but you can look into one of the main players involved with deep ties to Racine - John Jeffry Louis.
              </p>

               What would you like links on specifically?

               Start with this, the Earth Summit in Rio. It leads to Racine and the real agenda.

                It's by Charles Savoie, whose supposedly life’s work is to expose the centuries long scheme to control, suppress and demonetize silver by the secret society called ‘The Pilgrims’

                He has a very long list of names, but the article looks pretty tabloid, especially the end (imho).

             This is absolutely true. It was planned long ago. They have reduced male fertlity in shocking numbers through chemicals as well as other means.

            That model is right.  There is too much of a push to rush.  They want to churn the out as fast as they can, imo.  The Drag Reading is only the beginning if we do not speak out as parents.  Speak Out Parents, now before it is too late.  Once this becomes mainstream, as they want, it will be too late.  We will be fight even more Political Correctness!  I did near that one school fought the Satanic Group in their school and they left.  So there is hope out there, if you only speak up and speak out.

               That was a good post. I couldn't give it an upvoat because it was deleted, so I made sure to upvoat both mentions of it in this thread.

             Fuck him. He threatened me with death yesterday twice. It was saved in a secure location. He has tried to delete it but it has been caught. He is more than a shill that is the problem. I have called him out as an agent many times to his ridiculous denial. He played his hand yesterday by threatening with pictures of death scenes only sophisticated insiders would put forth.

              could you please check my last post? I have found a relationship between comet pizza and pizza brains. Nobody was able to join the dots yet and they both have shown Caris James photos. I think that if we find her it can prove James was lying when he stated she was her god daughter, also she might be dead by now.

               I've never heard of this show. Do you like this show or just this episode? Because I just read that he's on the Young Turks.

                Yeah, the Young Turks are owned and not on their own.  Jimmy Dore is  on the show, but is a very good investigator.  He had a very good piece about the Utah Truck Accident as well.  I think he just uses the Turks as an exposure vehicle.  Check him out.

                I don't know much about him, and I've only seen snippets here and there. I didn't know he was associated with YTs who I have heard are compromised. This episode is very harsh on the Clintons. He says All the Democrats are corrupt. I agree with that.  But was the mention of the truckers that got my attention, having seen Commoners post about the weird deaths on Wednesdays.

                     Yes. This story should be huge and all over mainstream media. But of course not. The picture of Obama and Hillary hugging in the beginning is pretty funny tho. They are SO FAKE!

                      I know that Alex Jones, theHill, Zero Hedge and Gateway pundit are all over it, so now that YT has it, its getting exposed to the bernie left and only a matter of time before it circles the cia-media.
