            I have figured for a while that Bush Sr bugged the whitehouse when he ran the CIA....When Trump was staying in Trump tower having meetings I knew it was for safety and most likely also privacy...at first I wasn't sure if it was because he was working for Clinton because media was making him look so bad I swore he had to be trying to lose to her......and it looks like Sidney Blumenthal is/was a spy and most likely many of the shadow government have private servers to do business on.

            To onderstand better how the distribution of evil fucks is in relation to all the good folk still out there, the following is a very good view to use when looking at all the organizations involved:
           </p>
           <p>
            <strong>
             AT THE BOTTOM THEY BELIEVE IN GOD. IN THE TOP, THEY WORSHIP SATAN
            </strong>
            .
           </p>
           <p>
            Some good folk got close to the top and with Trump, a glitch in the evil power structure took place. A good guy made it to POTUS. However, POTUS is the
            <em>
             public top
            </em>
            . The
            <em>
             shadow top
            </em>
            goes well beyond individual nations.

            If it makes you feel better, Trump made his "Epstein has a great social life and loves young girls" comment several years after he kicked him out of Mar A Lago. He was being polite for the press, because he had no reason to make an enemy with the CIA/Mossad at that time.
           </p>
           <p>
            There is no evidence of Trump going to the island.
           </p>
           <p>
            The worst is that Trump was in Epstein's black book, and his name was circled, which means he knew. It does not mean that he participated.
           </p>
           <p>
            George Webb has said that Trump was caught with an underage girl (like 16), but there is no corroborating evidence, and I think we would have seen that before he got elected.
           </p>
           <p>
            Trump has legendary street smarts and I think he figured out Epstein's game. That's how he survived this entire media bloodbath. Even if he wanted to fuck a hot older teenager, he knew that something was fishy. So he went home with his legal age model girlfriend instead.
           </p>
           <p>
            The question is what will Trump do now? Is he going to expose #pizzagate? Expose the CIA? It's up to him. He probably doesn't want to die like JFK. If he starts making arrests, CNN will say that he is a miltiary dictator doing a coup.
           </p>
           <p>
            But Trump is 70 years old. Maybe he wants to go out in a blaze. One thing we have learned is not to underestimate Trump.
           </p>
           <p>
            We're going to have to wait and see. Wikileaks says that it has only published 1% of Vault7.
           </p>
           <p>
            And Trump is very confident that he will be vindicated on the wiretapping story. Perhaps because of the Montgomery leaks.

            Probably because it's insecure as fuck. I'd much rather be 60 stories in the air of a steel structure, full of armed guards, than at ground floor in the middle of a metro area, with only a wrought iron fence and some corrupt secret service conspiracy protecting you.

             Right, like somewhere that only an aircraft could potentially slam into you at high speed? But that
             <em>
              almost

             never happens. I am not disagreeing with you. Just pointing something out for the sake of it.

              The fact that 2  unaccounted aircraft penetrated protected airspace without scrambling interceptors like what happened on 9/11 was a huge failure of Air Force defence procedures.  Remember they were told to stand down that day from the top brass, and there was also confusion because of training.  Those are some of the reasons so many people think it was an inside job.  And we live in a post 9/11 world, that would never be allowed to happen as long as the  military brass is on Trumps side.

            Essentially, he will have to gut the inside of the WH and totally remodel, replace every phone and computer system, and completely overhaul the FBI, CIA, NSA, Pentagon &amp; Secret Service before he would be completely secure. Or he will have to conduct business from Mar-a-Lago. I'm fine with that being the WH of the South.

             You pointed out something useful. The whitehouse is nothing more than a icon and is not a necessary rallying point of the people like it used to be. Its lost all meaning as a "place of power" as the people just dont care anymore. Otherwise there would be protests about MR. T not being in the WH.

               So, are you suggesting that "satan" won the war and wrote the bible.. I only ask because he didn't murder tens of thousands according to the bible. Just wondering.

                Pretty much. The version most people read was written by william shaksphere &amp; king james of england. There are versions that are much more accurate translations and present christianity in completly different terms. According to those versions we are currently moving into the parts where tribulations become obvious and the battle of Armageddon starts.  The people who choose good over evil win in the end though regardless of which religion they picked.  (Two classes to be precise
 Those exercising faith in YHWH through their words and one group which does so by their actions. Remembering that yhwh=pure love...)The trickiest trick the devil has is to convince man he doesnt exist.

            First, just because you mentioned them, mother Teresa opened orphanages for children to suffer and die without treatment. Colin Powell was knighted a Merovingian.

            But more to the point of your post, yes the White House is bugged without a doubt. I don't normally make such statements of fact, but in this case it's a simple matter. The phone systems in the White House, CIA HQ, Pentagon, DOJ etc. are all maintained by the same co. Remember when all high level gov managers were forced to use Blackberry devices? It was reportedly because they were the only "secure" phones. Yeah, sure. But, most interesting is the concept of Presidents who bug themselves, as in the "Nixon Tapes." Would YOU bug yourself?
           </p>
           <p>
            Now add to all that what we're learning about what the CIA has been up to. I'd say Trump was briefed on these issues and acts accordingly.
