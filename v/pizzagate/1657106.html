<p>Worldcorp seems to be hinting that they aren\'t the bad guys. All videos and people they have implicated in videos are all involved with experiments like this or human trafficking. It seems world corp has been at it for a while too. The ARG is a way to put out their insider info (like the release of the Podesta tape) without making waves and by playing it off as &quot;just a prank bro&quot; when it isn\'t. </p>
<p>MeatSleep was a very similar ARG that people have hinted is from the same people (but no proof exists of that claim). Meat sleep got shut down around when someone tried to expose them and got too close. By this time it started hinting at specific people in cases and suggesting that magazine ads were being used to traffic people.  Why is meat sleep similar? Well look up the Tara Calico case. She was abducted in new mexico and a poloroid of her was found in the parking lot. 2 more were later found. One was released to the public, one was not. Meat sleep gave out the one that was not. The topless one where she is bound and gagged.</p>
<p>Many people have been trying to say WorldCorp is just a waste of time.... I\'d think otherwise. Even the associated account seem to call out former military/business that have been involved in trafficking one way or another.</p>',

            This is a rabbit hole that I have been working on for the passed 3 days. Needless to say, it keeps getting weirder and weirder.
           </p>
           <p>
            Admittedly, the connection between Gary Lee Munroe and Worldcorp is a little shaky in my opinion - all we have is that Munroe uses the same name on his Tumblr mentioning Worldcorp as well as a facebook page called "Worlcorp", but I'm seeing no solid evidence that they are most definitely the one in the same. In other words, I'm not entirely sure the Worldcorp website with the "Fatherhood" video is definitely related to him other than just the generic name "Worldcorp"
           </p>
           <p>
            With that said, going down this path leads to some interesting shit. We know he uses multiple aliases and is permitted into several different countries for missionary type work, aid and volunteer effort, etc. We know he's affiliated with UNICEF given his pictures outside a UNICEF tent. He also aided in Ecuador after the Earthquake in April 2016, and also stayed behind after the recovery effort ended in order to provide extra help. I have also found from his Tumblr some paperwork from the Universal Life Church director, Daniel Zimmerman, sent to Mexico clarifying that Gary Lee Munroe is still active and legally able to reside in Mexico under his current permissions. I looked into Daniel Zimmerman and discovered that he was terminated from his position on Board of Directors for the Universal Life Church due to fraud as well as improper sexual advances to the younger staff members (college aged or so).
           </p>
           <p>
            Looking into Universal Life Church (ULC), I see that its basically a cheesy online "con" where individuals can become ordained online in a few simple steps and some money. Celebrities have done it (conan, lady gaga, bunch of others). ULC has a ton of affiliated websites, some no longer up, and all have a variety of tentacles and connections to all sorts of different places. Peru, Bolivia, Mexico, Ecuador, etc. Where it gets curious is Gary Lee Munroe talking about these "chip implants" being inserted into people for the purposes of spying on their governments. He talks about what OP talks about, how to discover if these have been used on you using different forms of technology (spectrum analyzers, etc). One quote by him had me interested though...due to his grammar and punctuation I can't tell if these are two different sentences or just one, but I'll include both just in case:
           </p>
           <p>
            "1.Name of the person known as Jamie Waller or as James Knox Wailer United staes, Mexico, Guatemala. Knoxville Tennasse 2.Works with CHILDREN ADOPTED then sent back to the homeland chip implanted to spy for united states and canada. Missionary Institute Guatemala --&gt; Guatemala Missions News 1:
            <a href="http://guatemalamissionaryinstitute.org/">

            </a>
            Mormon International is the other that is also behind espionage and spy chip implanted in the world of children wayed by adopting children then shipping back to the homeland for children to spy
            <a href="https://www.opednews.com/populum/page.php?f=NSA-SPYING-FILES-ON-AMERIC-by-Douglas-A-Wallace-091127-529.html">
             https://www.opednews.com/populum/page.php?f=NSA-SPYING-FILES-ON-AMERIC-by-Douglas-A-Wallace-091127-529.html
            </a>
            "
           </p>
           <p>
            I noticed that Jamie Waller made some blog entries on guatemalanmissionaryinstitute.org about International Adoption. Again, this crazy Gary Lee Munroe guy named someone that is allegedly involved in "implanting children to send back to homeland to spy on the government using adoption agencies" and sure enough I'm seeing some confirmation that indeed a Jamie Waller is involved in adoption agencies.
           </p>
           <p>
            So we have mention of adopted children being "implanted with chips" for spying purposes as well as Mormon International that is also behind this? So I followed both links in the above quote, and the second lead me to a guy (name of Douglas A. Wallace) talking all about this Mormon "takeover". At the tags above on his page, I see one titled "Mormon Church of Latter Day Saints". This was weird to me only because simultaneously while looking into this, I had a 4chan thread up regarding MK Ultra titled "bluepill me on MK Ultra" which can be found here:
            <a href="http://archive.is/1c9Fw">
             http://archive.is/1c9Fw
            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            In that thread, an Anon that seemed particularly knowledgeable on the subject (I'm new to MK Ultra and all that, I never truly entertained it as being a successful method of control but who knows) making multiple posts in the thread with a very organized history of MK Ultra, satanic ritual abuse, occultism, and the involvement of the Mormon Church of Latter day Saints. What the fuck? So at this point, my question was this: Why are the borderline Schizophrenic ramblings of a "Holy Sage Munroe" that claims to have been a victim of mind control, implanted with a chip, his children taken from him by the government, who also has multiple aliases actually rooted in SOME semblance of reality?
           </p>
           <p>
            I looked into the Mormon Church of Latter Day Saints (lds) in relation to this and found some curious things as well. Glenn Pace, a Bishop for the church, apparently was raised by Mormon Parents and was in a position of influence in the church until he decided to publish research on RITUAL ABUSE OF CHILDREN within the LDS:
           </p>
           <p>
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glenn_L._Pace">
             https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glenn_L._Pace
            </a>
            and
            <a href="http://www.moneyteachers.org/Mormon+MK+ULTRA+VICTIM+Speaks.html">
             http://www.moneyteachers.org/Mormon+MK+ULTRA+VICTIM+Speaks.html
            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            Alright, I'm so confused at this point. What is going on? I truly have no idea, but at this point I am going down the Rabbit Hole for the sake of exploration. Will it lead anywhere? Is this something that can benefit the Pedogate/Pizzagate cause? I'm not sure, but this is fascinating in and of itself.
           </p>
           <p>
            Here's the next interesting part. Remember Alex Jones talking about "Psychic Vampires" on the Joe Rogan podcast awhile back? He mentions how the Elite believe they are of a different race/species than the "plebs" or something, and they are utilizing AI in order to connect themselves to it via brain connection in order to control the masses? Something along those lines. Anyway, that article by Douglas A. Wallace I linked to above talks about NSA Spying, and how in 1966 a guy named Bill Gay began to create "the electronic ability to spy on people worldwide to help bring about the day when the church would be able to eliminate its enemies...". He says that it is technically a "Microwave Cavity Resonator". He states that the implementation of this technology would not take place until its International HQ at 50 East North Temple in Salt Lake City was completed. The writer's source claims that his job on building this building was to be ended at the completion of every floor EXCEPT the top 4 floors. When asked what those floors were, he said he didn't know, "but they are building it like a fort"
           </p>
           <p>
            Rabbit Hole indeed. Interestingly though, as interesting as Gary Lee Munroe appears to be, why is it that if he were actually a bad boi child trafficker or having some involvement in it, be WARNING the world about these "microchip" implants for use in spying? While I was reading it, I almost got the vibe that he was using that terminology to actually demonstrate some other type of reality, which would be children from adoption agencies being abducted and ritually abused in order to do the bidding of the abuser. He's mentioned RFID transmitters, which seem outdated to me, but I have found instances of sex trafficking victims being implanted with these devices when the doctors find them after the victim has been rescued.

             I'm technically a reverend of the ULC.  They were 100% invented for Tax evasion purposes. You don't pay them to be a reverand it's actually easier than that. Just sign your name online.

            <p>
             Any clue if Gary Munroe is related to Bob Monroe, the founder of Binural beats and using it for astral projection purposes. If so on the upside I actually can see about giving info, on the down side I think my family might actually of been tied and involved in all this tangled crap now. Thats really gonna suck for me and explain way too many things about my family that I am not wanting to confront.

              I didn't see any connection between the two of them in the research I have done thus far, but I can certainly take a look to see what I could find. Do you think your family and personal experience, regardless of if Gary Lee Munroe is related to Bob Monroe, has any significance in all of this?

               Maybe, I don't want to go into it if I don't have to. I personally think alot of things is just insanity.
               <br/>
               The military was very interested in Bob Monroes work. It'll leave it at that.

                Yep, no problem, but I am seeing the military's interest in Monroe's work for sure. At any rate, if I do discover a connection between Robert Monroe and this Gary Lee Munroe guy, maybe I'll PM you, and you can look into that privately.

             It seems like it. Id say there was room to argue it was maybe a troll if it weren't for the fucked up vids of Dr. Munroe. Someone knows something. Someone has the goods.

             WTF?! This was up 30 minutes ago. It had info at the end too (not just tips how to use a specific frequency tool to scan for RFID chips) but a time of the 2 videos (2011 but I forget the month and date)  as well as the file size and resolution and file type. It also stated the location (phillipines) in the video. Another video on the channel shows a person testing positive with the same testing equipment, and then vid info (philipines, file size, res, etc.) The ICAACT video covers all info, and in many ways is superior. The fact that someone is taking down those videos is weird.
            </p>
            <p>
             Very weird. I would hate to get into tinfoil territory and say that an RFID chip can be implanted to give more specific control of people than just altering their moods (why else would a PhD drink his own piss out of a dirty toilet) but it is theoretically possible. Look at what we have done with insects.

              RFID chips would be pretty old school considering voice to skull tech was accomplished in the 50's using chips but now only requires an eeg to lock on to a specific target.

             Possible. A non-profit is great for think tank purposes. Get like minded people with one focused goal from all over the place.

               Oh so you are saying the fatherhood and each day I grow some more videos which have been posted and topped this sub and have had voices analyized and has the abused child identifying the abuser a both "John" and "skippy" as well as the assailent referring to to him self as "John" all while having a similar voice as John Podesta are fake. You are right. Probably just a prank bro. Probably just an art piece. Don't look into it. Looking into it is wasting resource despite that there is no confined restraint or focused goal of what people research or look into. I should take your advice and not look into anything you suggest I don't look into. Others should do the same. Ignore that UN PhD that was drinking his own piss. Just a prank bro.
