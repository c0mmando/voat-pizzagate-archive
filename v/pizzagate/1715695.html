            Jose Carlos da Silva is noted as being 30 in 2007, so he would presumably be around 40 now. The Mirror article specifically mentions a "youngster", thus implying that they are not referring to da Silva - it probably relates to Ricardo Rodrigues, who was 16 at the time (so around 26 now).

            If the Met are indeed looking for a guy who was homeless and a heroin addict at such a young age, who was seemingly implicated in this matter years ago, then there's every possibly that by now he's not even alive. I don't know which way I'd bet, but I reckon he either knew absolutely nothing whatsoever about this crime or he knew far too much - so there's every chance that he might've took two heroin overdoses to the back of the head a long time ago.

            Basically, they're pushing the "botched burglary" theory, but it shouldn't be ruled out that these people may have been set up to either take Madeleine or to open up the apartment for somebody else. I really can't see how a burglary in this manner would grab the attention of MI6 within not even an hour, clearly something else happened here.
           </p>

            It's like saying that the gold at Brinks Mat just happened to be there by sheer coincidence: it wasn't by chance, those guys were set up to collect that gold specifically. Likewise, these Portuguese men were possibly set up for a far greater crime than robbing tourists.
