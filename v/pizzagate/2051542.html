            : This is a very hard-to-follow post. What is your premise? Why is this relavant to the abuse of kids by the global elite?
           </p>
           <p>
            Is your premise that AlertSense and Amazon's Audible service are signaling to gay pedophiles because the sound waves in their logos are really secret gay rainbows?
           </p>
           <p>
            If so, please come right out and say it. And also explain how that would help us bust elite child abusers. If you can't succinctly do that, please repost in

             v/pizzagatewhatever
            </a>
            , as this is a very VERY hypothetical theory only tenuously, indirectly related to Pizzagate. Removing per Rule 1.
           </p>
           <p>
            That's some impressive lateral thinking though!

             Hi, i knew this was coming and i realize you are right. After i posted i was relieved but all night i felt like the logo post was so stupid in light of what had happened earlier, wjen i wad using imgbb. I posted it and no ones taken it down its a the little AMANDA ( a man duh) girl being expoited sexually online. My old self before all these revelations, would probably have gone on a manic hunt and authority calling and facebooking trying to save the little girl or figure it out who her parents are, is she safe now or in a box? . But the way it happened, im glad i posted it, but i was in imgbb, and inadvertently exited, i just tried to recreate it but cant yet, so i exited my oage to imgbb front page somehow whete many photos various were shown but i saw kid in bikini and thought...no, thats not right. and im thinking that since i have never ever looked at imgbbs front page, its wares, that imgbb has been chompin on the bit to show me their stuff. Facebook did that too,  but this was really really weird. I am disturbed by it
            </p>
            <p>
             In general it's been hard to upload photos, I think that's part of the skewed power play on people, how hard it is to copy and paste and demonstrate simple shit, while companies like ALAMY and Getty 123rf have been super suspect to me as far as online sex photos and film of kids, not bc I see that there, but because of the way they have plans for teens and students to upload from mobile apps and lots of fakish styled opportunities for teens to get involved in with them and start uploading pics to them. I am not out searching the pictures just lookingbat business they do which is done in a manner suspect to me as they these stock photo companies also promise the public they can order whatever they want in ads. .
            </p>
            <p>
             Now imgbb, is the place voat recommended i use, but something is not right at all. Im freaked for the little girl amanda I found yesterday there at 69jb69 on imgbb. I wanna focus on that instead today.
            </p>
            <p>
             But to clear up my  perception on the ALERTSENSE POST the point to sum that up is this argument: 
Why not have the exclamation mark actually end in a point, and not instead end in an arc? 
My answer: Because it's not an exclamation mark. 
It is meant to be an arc that echoes the above arc and en that respect it also echoes the movement for LGBTP logo of two arcs or pedo sexual movement of Heart Progress that fit one into the other. If the exclamation mark ended in a point AS IT SHOULD i would have zero argument. You would be right to say im out there. 
Ask yourself how and why a designer would put an arc instead of a point on an exclamation point. But my answer is  To make a statement and send a message.
             <br/>
             Thanks for writing back to me.

              My pleasure, nameof. As a former reporter and editor, I would say why not find out who designed to logo and whether they had possible comnections to pro-pedo groups or individuals?
