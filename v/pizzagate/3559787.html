<p>Mike Feinberg, co-founder of the charter school network KIPP, was fired on Thursday following an independent investigation that found &quot;credible evidence&quot; related to three allegations of sexual misconduct. </p>
<p>former student alleging sexual abuse by Feinberg in the late 1990s.In the course of the inquiry, two other allegations were uncovered from the mid-2000s involving two former employees.</p>

<p>In the early days of KIPP, Feinberg is remembered as the hothead without boundaries who threw a TV through a plate glass window at KIPP Houston--the same reckless wild man who would load KIPP students into an unventilated U-Haul trailer for a &quot;field lesson&quot; across town. </p>
<p>&quot;Whatever it takes&quot; was &quot;Cage-Buster&quot; Feinberg\'s mantra, and he and David Levin believed that, as KIPP\'s top leaders, they should model the aggressive, hyper-macho, and abusive &quot;let the stallions run&quot; style of leadership for their growing and clueless regiment of &quot;school leaders.&quot;  No holds barred, take no prisoners, let the rules be damned.</p>

He\'s the one that made the statement in 2013  “When somebody’s 15 or 16 years old, what do they want to be? They want to be older, and they want to be cool like the girl in college, and that’s part of the magic of what we do at Pink.” He was pushing thong underwear with &quot;Call me&quot; or &quot;feeling lucky&quot; printed on them. </p>

<p>Apparently, KIPP endorses strict discipline:</p>
<p>Coordinator of Charter Schools, Debra Odom said a lengthy report prepared by the district alleges Tschang was using inappropriate forms of discipline including: slamming students against the wall, placing trash cans over their heads, forcing kids to crawl on their hands and knees while barking, and enforcing unreasonably strict bathroom rules, resulting in students having accidents and vomiting on themselves inside the classroom.</p>

<p>The parents said a group of children were mistreated by teachers who separated them from their peers in class and at lunch. The students, parents said, reported sitting on the floor and said one girl urinated on herself after not being allowed to use the restroom immediately. ” ‘I can’t take them yelling at me 10 hours today.’ “</p>

<p>Seems like a lot of shady characters are getting into the charter school business. KIPP is known for hiring new teachers right out of Teach for America, discourages teacher unionization, has high turnover at some schools. The founders of KIPP were TFA alumni. The founder of TFA is married to the CEO of KIPP. </p>
