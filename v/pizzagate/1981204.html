This is related to pizzagate as pizzagate is about exploitation of children including kidnapping children for human trafficking and other nefarious purposes.  There are those who are on our side, and there are those PRETENDING to be on our side, such as certain organizations that are supposedly anti-human trafficking but are highly suspicious.   Is this FBI website really trying to help?</p>',

            oh yeah, did you know the middle initial is the same too?  D.  On top of that, before Jeff Gannon was "jeff gannon", he went by James Guckert.  Another JDG.  Just like Johnny Gosch. Its very strange. I haven't been able to find anything at all on where this Jeff Gannon guy has been since he participated in GWB's administration's press conferences.

            that is a terrifying statistic if it is true.  I think this abuse absolutely goes on in elite circles, but I think it's rampant outside of them, as well.  As for JG, some people believe he is actually the same person as former white house correspondent Jeff Gannon.  I'm not too sure about that myself, but it's a fascinating rabbit hole to go down.

            great comment. thanks.

            looking at the FBI's website of such a small number of missing kids, I thought of Johnny Gosch.  His mom did report him missing and he is still classified as a missing child, but he is not on their website.
           </p>
           <p>
            One thing I can say is I don't think "the problem is not nearly as big as we want to believe," although I think there are some powers out there who would want us to think that.

             I tried to find anything on that FBI website that would provide context, but I didn't see anything.  I didn't see anything about brownstone...? or is that a joke/reference I'm not getting?  :)

              it was a joke, but, operation brownstone and brownstar were CIA programs for compromising/blackmailing people in powerful positions - to either find, or if not CREATE dirt on people. In the 50's / 60's they would use honeytraps for extramarital affairs or gay sex encounters. But after the sexual / gay revolutions these tactics lost their sting. So they had to use a type of sexual encounter that remained taboo and capable of destroying the social status of the accused.

            Yes -- we should #1 get missing kids back on milk cartons -- seemed that program was ended when children were
recognizing themselves -- i.e., too successful.
           </p>
           <p>
            Was just checking to see if there were any other lists of missing children and there's a Polly Klass website ( a young girl who was abducted and murdered)  suggests it has a "Master List" of Missing Children and "Amber Alert" seems to be offered there as a resource.
Runs more than 15 pages at the least, but they give no indication of how many children are listed on this site currently.
           </p>
           <p>
            CNN offers some "facts" but not necessarily a list -- 
They comment that ...
            <strong>
             Statistics:
According to the FBI's National Crime Information Center (NCIC) Missing Person File, there are 88,040 active missing person records, of which juveniles under the age of 18 account for 33,706 (38.3%) of the records. (as of December 31, 2016)
            </strong>
           </p>
           <p>
            Wasn't it at the time of the Adam Walsh kidnapping that the FBI was allegedly moved into missing children cases...
and that they got additional monies -- possibly $20 million more a year/? -- for resources to take on these cases?
           </p>
           <p>
            Also looked at the National Center for Missing &amp; Exploited - which also features Amber Alerts at top of page -- and they make this comment which I think we've all heard before --
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             One in six endangered runaways reported to NCMEC in 2016 were likely sex trafficking victims. 86% of these likely sex trafficking victims were in the care of social services or foster care when they went missing.&gt;
            </p>
           </blockquote>
           <p>
            They also comment** "1 in 6 of the 18,500 runaways reported to the National Center for Missing &amp;
Exploited Children in 2016 were likely sex trafficking victims."
           </p>
           <p>
            Now ... without even considering Pizzagate ...
            <strong>
             why wouldn't these 18,500 children and SEX TRAFFICKING be in the news every day and every minute?  Approximately 3,083 children would have ended up in the hands of sex traffickers.
            </strong>
            <a href="http://www.missingkids.com/home">
             http://www.missingkids.com/home
            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            Yet -- they are pretty much using the Pizzagate story to IGNORE the subject of child sex trafficking -- !!!
           </p>
           <p>
            Obviously, we have something really not explainable or defendable happening here.
           </p>
           <p>
            PLUS, we know where these children are being taken from -- 86% of them from social services or foster care.
           </p>
           <p>
            If a child falls into the care of social services they pretty much have a 86% chance of being trafficked.
Shouldn't that be considered a LEAD?  Shouldn't that require a national investigation of social services?
           </p>
           <p>
            How can that be?

             you're right.  they barely post missing kids' pictures anywhere.  WTF is up with that???  Every once in a while I get a mailer to my house with ads and there is a TINY picture of a missing kid with some info... seriously the picture couldn't be smaller if they tried.  And I notice its always kids who went missing many years ago.
            </p>
            <p>
             why in any humane sense would they NOT be putting kids pictures on milk cartons? other than evil being covered up?  it is royally messed up that we don't see these kids info and pictures posted anywhere.

            Thank you for this post.  This is an excellent example of not seeing the forest for the trees.  Also known as "the big lie".

            This shit is so wide and in your face.  When was the last time you saw a kid on a milk carton?  I know, trite, but the point being is missing kid PSAs have been usurped by human trafficking PSA.

            My guess is that the FBI generally doesn't have jurisdiction in missing persons cases unless a clear demonstration of a violation of Federal law has been presented.  I know that Criminal MInds seems to indicate that they jet all over the US.  I'm not sure of the reality of that, unless a clear case of a serial killer crossing state lines has been made.

            Or murder investigations which could tie into matters of national security or issues of interest to the Deep State.

            Hell, in the greater Washington, D.C. region, more than 500+ kids disappear annually.
