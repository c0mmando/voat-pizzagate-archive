            I like Are We Sure, doesnt hurt to have criticism.  Your post is about an old court case, nobody has time to consider such things or the technicalities.  Its hard to see what we could do about it.

             If you take a moment before jumping to conclusions, you'll see that I thanked AreWeSure for his input.  Thank you for your input as well.  I know you take a lot of abuse here, but after all, you are only doing your job.
            </p>
            <p>
             See, we can all be reasonable here.  No reason to resort to dirty tricks like burying posts.  Why so triggered guys?
