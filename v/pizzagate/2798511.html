<p>Q style:</p>
<p>If kidnappers had to risk transfer of a small boy in public, would they simply stick a dress on him for disguise?</p>
<p>Is the voice of a small child shouting in an emotional state gender distinguishable?</p>
<p>Is it possible to identify a missing child from a decade ago when all there is to go on is a possible first name and location?</p>
<p>Does the ‘family’ in the clip pause for a moment at the entrance to Comet? Does the player on the right turn to them for a moment before resuming his game?</p>
<p>Does the child in the video call out their first name? Is it reasonable to expect such a young child to remember their last name?</p>
<p>If a boy named Ian did indeed go missing from nearby in the weeks or months prior to this clip being filmed, would that be enough to finally prompt an official investigation?</p>
<p>It seems to me that many of the people who view about this clip are making flawed assumptions: 1) That the kid\'s voice heard in the clip is coming from inside CPP. 2) That the two adults seen with the kid in the dress just happened to be passing by. 3) That the kid in the dress was a girl, and the adults were her parents. I recall my annoyance at occasionally being asked if I was a boy or a girl at that age. Sticking a dress on a little boy would work for a temporary disguise if he was being actively searched for.</p>
<p>Frank Winstead was part of a committee (ANC) involving he oversight of the neighborhood Comet Ping Pong is in. Winstead claimed in one meeting that Alefantis was trying to bring rape and murder to the area. <a href="http://www.wikiwand.com/en/Comet_Ping_Pong">http://www.wikiwand.com/en/Comet_Ping_Pong</a></p>
<p>Mr. Winstead presumably was on stakeout for a good deal longer than two minutes, yet the only footage he uploads to YouTube is less than two minutes long, why? What is it about this particular clip that warranted posting online? Surely there was more footage of the lookouts playing ping pong.</p>
<p>It would seem that Mr. Winstead saw something about Comet that upset him enough to accuse them of rape and murder.</p>
<p>Consider the following scenario for what is seen and heard on the clip:</p>
<p>A couple were involved in the kidnapping of a young boy named Ian. They don\'t have him long, and need to turn him over to higher ups in the cabal for conditioning or whatever else, so they take him down to CPP. On the way there there they make Ian put on a little girl\'s dress, and warn him to act accordingly. Perhaps they scared him with details of what will be done to him once they hand him over to where they are going, and as they approach, Ian begins to yell from being terrified, hoping to attract attention and rescue. When they do arrive, however, a man playing ping pong with another man outside turns to them and says not to go in, because there is someone in a car across the street filming, trying to gather evidence of illegal activity. Ian hears this and sees a chance of being rescued. As the couple continue on past the door Ian tries to turn and wave to the person doing the surveillance, but only has a moment and is unable to spot the camera. Still he yells out &quot;Hey!&quot; (Which, being turned towards the camera and microphone, gets picked up very clearly on the audio track, proving that the voice of the child heard is the same one seen) and a moment later &quot;I\'m Ian!&quot;. But an adult has a firm grip on his wrist, and he is dragged away, unable to offer any kind of a struggle, but continues to call out “help me” and “save me”.</p>
<p>This is what I hear, from the point where the kid tried to stop and wave to attract attention (good headphones turned up loud recommended):</p>
<p>&quot;Hey&quot; &quot;Wait&quot; &quot;Hey&quot; &quot;Save Me&quot; &quot;I\'m Ian&quot; &quot;Help Me&quot; Save Me”.</p>
<p>Then the lookout/ping pong player scored and calls out “Heeeyyy”.</p>
<p>I\'m not sure why I always hear &quot;I\'m Ian&quot; when no one else has said they heard the same thing - listen with headphones. I have posted what I heard on YouTube comments as well as on Voat and Reddit, and of course other commentators say they hear all kinds of things. Pointless to argue about it, but let’s just assume the kid\'s name is Ian for the moment.</p>
<p>I have tried searching the database of missing children, but a last name is required. Did a small boy named Ian go missing from near Washington, D.C. in the weeks or months prior to May 26, 2007, when the original video was uploaded? It may just be possible that the evidence needed to provoke an official investigation has been online for almost a decade, but at the very least this scenario should be considered and checked against missing children records.</p>',

            Fearless Freep. Was that not a underground comic character from the late 60's/early 70's? That was Rip off Press I believe. Harvey Pekar and his younger brother Allen were born in Cleveland, Ohio, to a Jewish family. Their parents were Saul and Dora Pekar, immigrants from Białystok, Poland. Saul Pekar was a Talmudic scholar who owned a grocery store on Kinsman Avenue, with the family living above the store. Ahh, the good old days in Ohio.

              Probably borrowed in part for the various artists. Not sure. I know someone who has the entire collection, and that would sort things out as to who copied who. Ramones was a CIA band so they say..

                It's not mine. That theory has been out there long before I was on the web. My CIA buddy showed up one day in a Ramones shirt a couple of years back. I did not bring it up in conversation. As far as I know the entire punk rock scene was black ops at the beginning. Patty Smyth, Warhol, and other familiar names are somehow involved with the promulgation. Goal was to create kids who cared about nothing but drugs and cheap thrills, as far as the end result goes and in my opinion.

                 Yeah, this pretty pretty ludicrous.   Johnny would have signed up if they let him in, but there's no fucking way they would have him.  And Dee Dee?  My goodness. I know a guitar store that won't sell him any guitars AND that's after he became famous.

                 Pretty sure drugs and cheap thrills were a thing before the Ramones.

                 So how this work?   We'll take a bunch of misfits and have them play a bluegrass bar with dog shit on the floor in an abandoned part of the city and we'll use this to take over the kids?    My god if anything was a genuine grass roots DIY thing, it was punk.  Punk had to actually create they own venues or else they would never be able to tour.

                 The Ramones couldn't get a gig in New Jersey for godsakes and you think they government funded?  Ludicrous.

                 I do subscribe the theory that Sid Vicious did not kill Nancy Spungen, but that she was murdered by a sketchy New York guy who had been hanging out the party that day.  The theory was Nancy and Sid passed out and she woke up and caught this guy trying to rip off their stuff and he killed her and she was dead when Sid woke up.

                  Gee, thanks for muddying the waters. That is why we rely on your research so much here. You don't know crap about Punk. I was there at the time.

            "I have tried searching the database of missing children, but a last name is required". I have had so many frustrations with search engines and sites that I am convinced they are in on it. Why would he have to be from the DC area? Kid would not know where he was if asleep on a plane, train, or automobile. People are searching for the kids, but there is no one site where relatives from around the world can post everything they know with translation tool, AKA both child and adult, and easily searched. It has to be privately owned because of what we have uncovered. Another good idea would be to have multi-country branches archiving in case one or more country decides to extinguish.

            Question 1: Yes. Sexual dimorphism is less noticeable in children than in adults, that trick works on a small child.
