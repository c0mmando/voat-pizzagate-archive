“The Second Mile had three offices in Pennsylvania, with headquarters in State College, Pennsylvania. The charity’s revenue, primarily from donations and fundraisers such as golf tournaments, was $3 million in 2009.
[10] Major companies and foundations that have given to The Second Mile include Bank of America, Bank of NY Melon, the Hershey Company, Merck,
State Farm, Sheetz, U.S. Steel Corp., PepsiCo, Frito-Lay, local Walmarts and newspapers. [11] The charity paid its CEO $133,000 a year, and his wife received about $100,000 a year.”

<p>Jerry Sandusky’s Second Mile Charity May Be as Culpable as Penn State
(<a href="https://nonprofitquarterly.org/2011/11/14/jerry-sanduskys-second-mile-charity-may-be-as-culpable-as-penn-state/">https://nonprofitquarterly.org/2011/11/14/jerry-sanduskys-second-mile-charity-may-be-as-culpable-as-penn-state/)</a>)</p>
<p>It seems to me that there was a huge coverup involving the board and Tom Corbett, as well as potential child trafficking from the charity itself. This could link back to both Jeffrey Epstein’s doings and the Clintons, as the Clintons have close ties with Penn State and the football program.</p>
<p>Im finding names of people that will need to be interviewed and a few books that will need reading. Sandusky was part of a tri state child sex ring. Im pretty tired. Here are some good links if someone wants to carry on.</p>

<p>A couple people who need looked into.
Lt. Col. Michael Aquino
Greg Bucceroni</p>
<p>(<a href="http://www.thewire.com/national/2012/09/former-child-prostitute-claims-jerry-sandusky-was-part-pedophile-sex-ring/57059/">http://www.thewire.com/national/2012/09/former-child-prostitute-claims-jerry-sandusky-was-part-pedophile-sex-ring/57059/)</a>)
This article brings up Greg Bucceroni. Searching him on google brings up a ton of leads for child sex rings in the area. Im sure any and all of those sex rings are related. They all seemed to be high profile “customers”

           Jerry Sandusky’s Second Mile Charity May Be as Culpable as Penn State

           It seems to me that there was a huge coverup involving the board and Tom Corbett, as well as potential child trafficking from the charity itself. This could link back to both Jeffrey Epstein’s doings and the Clintons, as the Clintons have close ties with Penn State and the football program.

           Im finding names of people that will need to be interviewed and a few books that will need reading. Sandusky was part of a tri state child sex ring. Im pretty tired. Here are some good links if someone wants to carry on.

This article brings up Greg Bucceroni. Searching him on google brings up a ton of leads for child sex rings in the area. Im sure any and all of those sex rings are related. They all seemed to be high profile “customers”

            Trying to get this through to a Sandusky post so it doesn't get lost. You've done a great job and hope you might add the following connections: Graham Spanier (President of Penn State at time) is long time &amp; very close friend with none other than Roskens who was one of Franklin perps .
"Brent Goodwin – former U.S. Naval Intel, former CIA field officer, private detective – delivered a scathing expose on Graham Spanier. “Spanier + Roskens are both ‘closeted’ gay men sexually aroused by young boys; classic pedophiles. Roskens has ties to former Franklin Credit Union president / convicted felon child molester Larry King, and a long list of known pedophiles throughout the U.S. Several of Spanier’s ‘military friends’ were recently charged in an international pedophilia scandal at Dept of Defense. Spanier + Roskens were close friends and longtime associates of convicted child molester Dr. Daniel Schrein.” -

            The quick death of paterno had me suspicious.
Sandusky victims said they were taken in private jets and pumped to big money doners to penn state. I wonder if there's a D1 NCAA ring. These schools have access to kids and recruiting and the power to make or break a kids dreams.
