<p><em>Oh really? /s</em></p>
<p>Of course they didn\'t inform the police. Why would they? We know that pedos are blackmail material. And Morrison was very close to Margaret Thatcher (PM at the time), who in turn was very close to notorious pedo Jimmy Savile. She even spent Christmas with him. </p>
<p><em>11 Mar 2019</em> </p>
<p>Giving evidence anonymously to the Independent Inquiry Into Child Sexual Abuse (IICSA), a lawyer with the security service apologised for it having taken a “narrow, security-related view” of the accusations against Sir Peter Morrison.</p>
<p>“With hindsight,” the lawyer, whose voice was heard via remote video link, said “it was a matter of deep regret” that MI5 had not cooperated with police or made inquiries into the activities of the former MP for Chester, who died in 1995.</p>
<p>The official said the security service did not investigate people merely because they had a public profile but only when there was reason to suspect they posed a threat to national security. </p>
<p>Not all files were “adverse”, he added, saying that some might be opened if a person was targeted by a terrorist group or could be susceptible to approaches by a foreign intelligence organisation.</p>

It said that stories about Morrison, who was then minister of state for trade and industry, “persist”.</h2>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>A member of MI5, Duff wrote, had heard from two sources that Morrison had “a penchant for small boys”. The source was understood to be Donald Stewart, the Conservative party agent for Westminster.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The security service was not sure whether it was based on rumours previously aired in 1983 or on more recent events. Duff ended the letter saying: “I would just as soon that we didn’t get involved for the time being.”</p>
<p><strong>An internal MI5 memo in November 1986 from Eliza Manningham-Buller, later director general of the security service, said she had seen Morrison and his family the previous night for dinner and he had told her that the prime minister was supporting him.</strong> </p>
<p>Morrison said he hoped the press would publish so that he could sue and “nail the lies”.</p>
<h2 id="md-the-security-service-also-recorded-reports-that-morrison-had-been-picked-up-for-importuning.">The security service also recorded reports that Morrison had been picked up for importuning.</h2>
<p>Manningham-Buller, who is due to appear before IICSA on Tuesday, has told the inquiry that she was not the member of MI5 staff who had first heard the rumours against Morrison, who later became parliament private secretary to Margaret Thatcher.</p>
<p>Brian Altman QC, counsel to the inquiry, suggested that the statement that Thatcher knew about the allegations against Morrison and was nonetheless supporting him depended entirely on the MP’s version of events. The MI5 lawyer agreed that appeared to be so.</p>
<p>“Wasn’t the obvious route,” Altman suggested, “that an inquiry should have been made of Sir Robert Armstrong to ask if the prime minister was supporting Morrison in those terms?” The service had been “rather blinkered” about the proper approach, he added.</p>
<h2 id="md-the-inquiry-also-heard-evidence-about-mi5s-investigation-into-the-activities-of-sir-peter-hayman-a-former-high-commissioner-to-canada-who-retired-in-1984-and-died-in-1992.">The inquiry also heard evidence about MI5’s investigation into the activities of Sir Peter Hayman, a former high commissioner to Canada, who retired in 1984 and died in 1992.</h2>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Hayman kept detailed diaries about his sex life which were seized when his flat in Bayswater, central London, was raided. The director of public prosecutions (DPP) later gave MI5 access to them.</strong></p>
<p><strong>The security service interviewed Hayman’s friends and then him, particularly about reports that in the 1950s when he was in Baghdad local boys had visited him for sexual purposes. The DPP, Hayman told MI5, had given him immunity from prosecution.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The outcome of the investigation, the MI5 lawyers said, was that Hayman had rendered himself vulnerable to blackmail but that there had been no actual prejudice to security.</p>
<p>The MI5 officer was also taken through a list of prominent individuals whose activities had raised questions about child abuse. </p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Among them was Maurice Oldfield, a former head of MI6, who had told Thatcher that he had had “homosexual encounters”, dating back to the 1940s and 1950s, with “house boys” and “hotel stewards” in Asia.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The agency’s records, the inquiry was told, also mentioned unsubstantiated allegations against the former Conservative MPs Christopher Chataway, Charles Irving and Sir William van Straubenzee. All have since died. It is not clear whether any information on them was ever passed to police.</p>

            Let us not forget that the UK Child Sex Abuse Scandals are the NEXUS from which ALL OTHER SRA/CSA trafficking/extortion rings ORIGINATE from. As melting pot of freemason, lubavitcher,  nazi and the elite think tanks like Tavistock, England is the wellspring that harbors the occult eye of horus and certainly is from where all conspiracy continues to arise from. Of course most of you know the preeminent authority on the UK sexual abuse scandals is the infamous Aangirfan - here:
            <a href="https://aanirfan.blogspot.com/">
             http://aanirfan.blogspot.com/
            </a>
            with thousands of blog entries testifying to the aboveand over a decade of research following how the United States has been compromised in the same manner mirroring the approach the UK security services used child sexual extortion to bend their politicians to the will of the globalist bankers.

             They do great work, but I always take it with a grain of salt, because they often throw in some allegations without being able to prove it. And with 'prove' I mean they don't have plausible evidence.

              I disagree. There was and still is NOONE that writes like Aangirfan and noone that has had the focus that Aangirfan has had and who has been able to connect the dots like they do, absolutely NOONE. They have been the only impetus for the major stories about Institutional Child Abuse and SRA/CSA that keep circulating and breaking new ground every day. I ask you to name one blogger that has been writing like they have for over ten years, I honestly cannot think of one beside David Icke, and of course he has always backfilled with well, you know.

              And one more thing about "not being able to prove" the allegations, it's called nuance, metaphor and the power of suggestion, a simple picture can tell a story of a thousand words and prove all kinds of things for the reader and that's exactly what Aangirfan has done for over ten years.

               But they sometimes throw around allegations that people are CIA etc., without even explaining why we should believe this, and sometimes their posts are partly based on posts of other bloggers that don't care to provide plausible explanations.

               I beg to differ here when it comes to aangirfan. See above. Because sometimes their posts lack 'nuance'. That's their weakness, and that's why I take everything they write with a grain of salt. Sorry.

                Your blood pressure must be crazy from all that salt because there was no-one writing about the UK sex abuse scandals and extortion rings 10 years ago and there still isn't. Aangirfan seems to have been the only one for a very long time, the only one, so I'm not quite sure how you cannot give credit where credit is due. I'm not sure what your sorry about it's the indisputable truth what Aangirfan has contributed to the world no need to apologize for anything at all. Not quite sure where you have been throughout all of this but I have been here the entire time as well and there was noone writing about ANY of this before Aangirfan.
               </p>
               <p>
                many have parrotted the same argument as you and the problem is they never set out to "prove" anything at all and you still don't get my drift, the way they write along with the pictures tells the entire story, no need to prove anything.

                 I have been talking about their

                <p>
                 Well, obviously you don't get my drift either. It's
                 <em>
                  not enough
                 </em>
                 to throw around allegations and add some 'telling pics'.
                </p>
                <p>
                 The whole reason why I'm a bit unnerved by them is that I often felt I stumbled into a trap - I was enticed by a clickbaity headline, and then was disappointed when I found I couldn't use and quote what they'd written, because they didn't even try to present evidence.
                </p>
                <p>
                 And no, accusing nearly everybody of being CIA is not enough.

                 One question (and you don't have to answer it): Are you in any way connected to the gals who run the blog? Is this why you are defending them in this manner? Because you're usually more critical,

                  I am not connected to the alleged nuns that run the Aangirfan Blog no think- and my loyalty to them is only because they are such pioneers in maintaining such a stance for such a long time, and have followed their work for just as long and have contributed from time to time.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  Think-, I don't want to "argue" with you. I know this isn't an "argument" per say, just a discussion, and I am amazed at your need to break down every single sentence with a rebuttal, it is impressive yet slightly alarming lol. I only mean that in jest as well it truly only means that you care what people perceive and that you are a true 'autist' and empath. I don't ever mean to confront you or make you feel like you have to reply in such a manner and maybe I do come off some sort of way, I have to rethink the way I approach those that are in on this with me because surely think- I don't ever mean to offend you.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  I guess my rebuttal to your points remains the same, of course you are free to believe what you want about them but for me they have always had a sort of ability to convey in a manner I enjoy that I can't really quite put into words at the moment.

             Actually, I think this is a very important and exciting statement - they really confirm that Hayman was into pedo activities imo. While still to this day, people claim that anti-pedo activists made the allegations against Hayman up.
