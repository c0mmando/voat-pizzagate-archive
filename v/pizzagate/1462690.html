            How often do 25, 50 or 100 people get together and
            <em>
             peacefully
            </em>
            protest?  I mean seriously, without somebody going off and it ending up in either mass arrests (after teargas and billy clubs, of course) or rioting, or both?   Whether they be goaded into it by counter-protesters, the police, paid agitators or simply groupthink -and this is probably the single most volatile subject on earth, mind you...protesting in that location will
            <strong>
             <em>
              not
             </em>
            </strong>
            end peacefully.

            I'd join a vigil or other peaceful protest action (but especially a vigil, a vigil would be awesome) by the actual pizza place, but I'm not in the region.

            i totally understand what you mean, still we have to be aware for their further steps against us. let's not be naive, they have all the power in their hands.
           </p>
           <p>
            the only thing they couldn't prevent are PEACEFUL public demonstrations, we have to show that we are peaceful investigators looking for justice according to our existing laws and not allowing any kind of lynchlaw.

            A lot of people don't live near DC, and this is an extremely busy part of the year for the younger centipedes with school and all that. Once "winter break" hits, I can see something like this happening.
           </p>
           <p>
            But also, people are scared as fuck. There are some people who are going through VPNs to access anything pizzagate related. I don't think there are too many ballsy people to actually show their face near that restaurant.

             Hell Yes,
If this thing is REAL, and your talking about bringing down the US GOV, then they will pull no stops to silence anybody who step's into that zone of death.
We are speculating that 20+ years this location has been used to file 'snuff films' and process children for torture. If its true then your talking about the entire DC establishment coming down. They have every and any interest to set an example with any pizzagate investigators, my PERSONAL GUESS is that they will plant real child-porn on anybody they arrest, put child porn on their phones, and on their home computers.
Standard operating procedure to discredit and silence non-approved journalists is to destroy them, 
If this story is true EXPECT 1,000's of people to be murdered.
...
The first people to step forward become martyrs or framed in prison for child abuse.
            </p>
            <p>
             Getting to the real perverts in DC is going to be long and difficult task, just look at history, Franklin, McMartin, Saville, all investigators had their lives destroyed.
            </p>
            <p>
             There are NO winners in this game.
