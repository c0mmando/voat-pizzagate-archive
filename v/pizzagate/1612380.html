<p>SIC CODE:
874104 (Construction Management)</p>
<p>NAICS CODE:
237990 <strong>(Other Heavy Construction)</strong></p>
<p>I decided to look up the NAICS Code (figure out what &quot;Other Heavy Construction&quot; means) and here is what I found (this aligns with my original theory in my past VOAT post about tunnels):</p>
<p><a href="http://siccode.com/en/naicscodes/237990/other-heavy-and-civil-engineering-construction-1">http://siccode.com/en/naicscodes/237990/other-heavy-and-civil-engineering-construction-1</a></p>
<p><strong>NAICS CODE: 237990 (Other Heavy Construction)</strong></p>
<p>“<strong>Description</strong></p>
<p>This industry comprises establishments primarily engaged in heavy and engineering construction projects (excluding highway, street, bridge, and distribution line construction). The work performed may include new work, reconstruction, rehabilitation, and repairs. Specialty trade contractors are included in this group if they are engaged in activities primarily related to engineering construction projects (excluding highway, street, bridge, distribution line, oil and gas structure, and utilities building and structure construction). Construction projects involving water resources (e.g., dredging and land drainage), development of marine facilities, and projects involving open space improvement (e.g., parks and trails) are included in this industry.</p>
<p><strong>Illustrative Examples</strong></p>
<p>Channel construction - Land drainage contractors - Dam construction - Marine construction - Dock construction - <strong>Microtunneling contractors</strong> - Dredging (e.g., canal, channel, ditch, waterway) - Nuclear waste disposal site construction - Earth retention system construction - Park ground and recreational open space improvement construction - Flood control project construction - Railroad construction - Golf course construction - <strong>Subway construction - Horizontal drilling (e.g., cable, pipeline, sewer installation)</strong> - Trenching, underwater - Hydroelectric generating station construction - <strong>Tunnel construction</strong></p>
<p>YES, IT IS HIGHLY POSSIBLE THAT AG CONTRACTING SERVICES COULD HAVE DONE SOMETHING UNDERGROUND AT 1644 NORTH CAPITAL. FROM THE DESCRIPTIONS/EXAMPLES ABOVE, THEY LOOK LIKE THEY ARE QUALIFIED TO DO THIS.</p>
<p><strong>Let’s discuss the players within AG Contracting Services:</strong></p>
<p>The name Whitney Tull came up in most of my AG Contracting Services queries, so I decided to start with her.</p>
<p><a href="http://radaris.com/">http://radaris.com/</a>~Whitney-Tull/281490243</p>
<p>This following is her day job:</p>
<p>Zimmer Holdings, Inc – Washington, DC
Senior Director, Government Affairs
since Jun 2012</p>
<p>Zimmer Holdings, Inc
Director, Government Affairs
Sep 2010 - Jul 2012</p>
<p>Zimmer Holdings, Inc
Associate Director, Government Affairs
Apr 2008 - Sep 2010</p>
<p>From the link above (<a href="http://radaris.com/">http://radaris.com/</a>~Whitney-Tull/281490243), Whitney Tull is part of two organizations (besides her day job at Zimmer Holdings). Note that these two organizations have the same address</p>
<p>ORGANIZATIONS</p>

<p>Whitney Tull
Principal

Whol Construction/Mining Equipment
900 2Nd St Ne, Washington, DC 20002</p>
<p>Again, these two (2) organizations are at the same address; As a note, this is the other organization: <a href="http://www.cfare.org/about/organization-history-and-background">http://www.cfare.org/about/organization-history-and-background</a></p>
<p>The following is Whitney Tull’s LinkedIn profile:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/whitneytull">https://www.linkedin.com/in/whitneytull</a></p>
<p>Out of curiousity, I then looked up Whitney Tull\'s residence address.</p>
<p>Whitney lives at 3801 Connecticut Ave NW <strong>(really close to Comet Ping Pong)</strong>  <strong>Note:</strong> this may or may not be relevant, but curious indeed if we are trying to make connections back to James Alefantis. Does she frequent Comet Ping Pong? Perhaps</p>
<p>Below is a map from her house to Comet Ping Pong.</p>

<p><strong>Other Players in AG Contracting Services:</strong></p>
<p>I did some further digging and found some other names:</p>

<p>There are three additional players (Kevin Stone, Ayich Legesse and Geadion Gebreyese) that I need to look into. As a note, Whitney Tull is the main person listed for AG Contracting Services in most of the links I have found.</p>

           There are three additional players (Kevin Stone, Ayich Legesse and Geadion Gebreyese) that I need to look into. As a note, Whitney Tull is the main person listed for AG Contracting Services in most of the links I have found.

          <p>
           ALSO. The business is listed as “INACTIVE”. The other link below states the same.
