<p>This chapter covers Pedowood’s mob ties and connects more cover up dots based on some reexamining of old information. What I found regarding the mob’s tendrils in Univeral Studios is much worse than I thought.</p>

<p><a href="http://magaimg.net/img/7u71.jpg">http://magaimg.net/img/7u71.jpg</a> Ron Meyer</p>
<p>Working Theory:</p>
<p>-1st incident: Twilight Zone (TV Series) Suspects: Steven Spielberg. Judith\'s mother (accomplice). Witness: Clare Torao</p>
<p>-2nd Incident: Jaws the Revenge. Suspects: Steven Spielberg, Sidney Sheinberg, Joseph Sargent. Witness: Fritzi Jane Courtney. Timeline: February-May 1987 Accomplice: Adria Later, Lorraine Gary, Judith’s mother</p>
<p>-The Murder:</p>
<p>Suspects: Steven Spielberg, Mike Rosenfeld, Edgar Bronfman Jr (conspirators), Jewish Mafia (carrier, most likely a sect with ties to Bronfmans). Jozseph Barsi was an abusive scumbag who deserves to burn in hell, but he was not the killer. He was however, the perfect patsy for the crime. &quot;The most effective lies are based off a truth.&quot; The perfect patsy is someone that is already suspect and who\'s character one would expect to pull off the crime. I suspect between 3 and 4 assailants. </p>
<p>Motive: I suspect it was because whatever programing Pedowood does via sexual abuse didn\'t take (her heart was too strong). Also I suspect the sickos wanted to harvest the public\'s emotional energy by triggering a mass grief/despair event (by murdering a child who was so beloved by the country). She would have been the type to talk when she got older, so I suspect getting rid of loose ends is likely.</p>
<p>Accomplices: LA PD, the media, Ruth Hansen, Sid Sheinberg, CAA, Jack Dorsey, David Brock, Ben Collins, Mark Zuckerberg, Eric Schmidt, Jonah Peretti.</p>
<p>Timeline of the murder: May 1988. Judith Barsi has a breakdown during a singing audition for All Dogs Go to Heaven. Ruth Hansen (her agent) warns Univeral that Judith might potentially tell about Pedowood. Judith’s fate was basically sealed by that breakdown, for that was the origins of the ensuing murder plan. The abuse and threats at the hands of Josepz Barsi would become tools to carry out the “murder suicide” by enacting the murder plan to match those very words, including burning the house down, using Fatal Vision as a template.</p>
<p>The most likely time of the murder was sometime between 12 AM-4 AM, 7/27/1988 (which would match Grand Climax). The killers broke into the house in 7/25. Since a sacrifice is likely, I believe the family was drugged/sedated for much of 7/26. Possibly for preparations. The culprits killed them via gun shot on 7/27 as per a hollywood hit, ie head shot as part of the &quot;murder suicide&quot; angle that would be sold to the public. The bodies were stacked like a pyre, and according to Metal Den, Judith\'s was on top (which would make the &quot;murder suicide angle&quot; IMPOSSIBLE). The culprits doused gasoline onto the bodies, lighting them on fire, also part of the murder suicide narrative. Since we know the fire happend on 8:30 AM, this means that its likely that a set up was done. Possibly something like a &quot;Ryuguu Gas Bomb&quot;. Basically, it\'s an incendiary bomb involving gasoline and the fumes. The ignition source can be programed to go off at a specific time. Something as simple as an egg timer can be wired to be such. Of course in such a scenario, one is relying on the fire to destroy the evidence, which includes the scent of a corpse and the set up. An autopsy report was never given for Jozesph Barsi.</p>
<p>Murder Weapons: Pistol with silencer, gasoline based incendiary bomb set up.</p>
<p>Post Murder: 7/27/1988. Don Bluth possibly threatened in regards to Judith Barsi’s death? I suspect Spielberg found out about that attempted protective migration (which means Judith would have told if she got older) and had to wrap up some loose ends.</p>',

           Turns out NBC has a big financial relation with Buzzfeed. Buzzfeed as shown in the previous chapter was involved in getting people banned for talking about Steven Spielberg being a pedophile. This link is NOT a coincidence.

           CAA was HEAVILY involved in covering up Harvey Weinstein’s crimes. I doubt this was the only crime they’ve covered up. Its entirely possible they were involved in the cover up of Judith Barsi’s murder.

           A relevant incident regarding a cover up of a nearly fatal accident on Kill. Weinstein and CAA involved. Further past history of willingness to cover up Hollywood’s evil deeds.

           Seems this movie was the first film Don Bluth made after his falling out with Steven Spielberg. Both Amblin Entertainment and Univeral Pictures were involved in backing Land Before time.

           Sid Sheinberg’s funeral was on 3/11. Given that a cause of death has yet to be released to the public, I suspect some fuckery involved in his death.

           MCA has been interwined with the mob for a VERY long time. Lew Wasserman had suspected Chicago Outfit ties.

           The Chicago Outfit were working with the Bronfmans during Prohibition. In short, MCA went from Chicago Outfit control to Bronfman control (not much difference).

           Working Theory:
          </p>
          <p>
           -1st incident: Twilight Zone (TV Series) Suspects: Steven Spielberg. Judith's mother (accomplice). Witness: Clare Torao
          </p>
          <p>
           -2nd Incident: Jaws the Revenge. Suspects: Steven Spielberg, Sidney Sheinberg, Joseph Sargent. Witness: Fritzi Jane Courtney. Timeline: February-May 1987 Accomplice: Adria Later, Lorraine Gary, Judith’s mother
          </p>
          <p>
           -The Murder:
          </p>
          <p>
           Suspects: Steven Spielberg, Mike Rosenfeld, Edgar Bronfman Jr (conspirators), Jewish Mafia (carrier, most likely a sect with ties to Bronfmans). Jozseph Barsi was an abusive scumbag who deserves to burn in hell, but he was not the killer. He was however, the perfect patsy for the crime. "The most effective lies are based off a truth." The perfect patsy is someone that is already suspect and who's character one would expect to pull off the crime. I suspect between 3 and 4 assailants.
          </p>
          <p>
           Motive: I suspect it was because whatever programing Pedowood does via sexual abuse didn't take (her heart was too strong). Also I suspect the sickos wanted to harvest the public's emotional energy by triggering a mass grief/despair event (by murdering a child who was so beloved by the country). She would have been the type to talk when she got older, so I suspect getting rid of loose ends is likely.
          </p>
          <p>
           Accomplices: LA PD, the media, Ruth Hansen, Sid Sheinberg, CAA, Jack Dorsey, David Brock, Ben Collins, Mark Zuckerberg, Eric Schmidt, Jonah Peretti.
          </p>
          <p>
           Timeline of the murder: May 1988. Judith Barsi has a breakdown during a singing audition for All Dogs Go to Heaven. Ruth Hansen (her agent) warns Univeral that Judith might potentially tell about Pedowood. Judith’s fate was basically sealed by that breakdown, for that was the origins of the ensuing murder plan. The abuse and threats at the hands of Josepz Barsi would become tools to carry out the “murder suicide” by enacting the murder plan to match those very words, including burning the house down, using Fatal Vision as a template.
          </p>
          <p>
           The most likely time of the murder was sometime between 12 AM-4 AM, 7/27/1988 (which would match Grand Climax). The killers broke into the house in 7/25. Since a sacrifice is likely, I believe the family was drugged/sedated for much of 7/26. Possibly for preparations. The culprits killed them via gun shot on 7/27 as per a hollywood hit, ie head shot as part of the "murder suicide" angle that would be sold to the public. The bodies were stacked like a pyre, and according to Metal Den, Judith's was on top (which would make the "murder suicide angle" IMPOSSIBLE). The culprits doused gasoline onto the bodies, lighting them on fire, also part of the murder suicide narrative. Since we know the fire happend on 8:30 AM, this means that its likely that a set up was done. Possibly something like a "Ryuguu Gas Bomb". Basically, it's an incendiary bomb involving gasoline and the fumes. The ignition source can be programed to go off at a specific time. Something as simple as an egg timer can be wired to be such. Of course in such a scenario, one is relying on the fire to destroy the evidence, which includes the scent of a corpse and the set up. An autopsy report was never given for Jozesph Barsi.
          </p>
          <p>
           Murder Weapons: Pistol with silencer, gasoline based incendiary bomb set up.
          </p>
          <p>
           Post Murder: 7/27/1988. Don Bluth possibly threatened in regards to Judith Barsi’s death? I suspect Spielberg found out about that attempted protective migration (which means Judith would have told if she got older) and had to wrap up some loose ends.

            In 1993, Wasserman created Universal CityWalk and made numerous, substantial changes to the Universal City area. Wasserman pocketed an estimated $350 million from the sale of MCA and remained as manager, but with vastly diminished power and influence, until Seagram bought controlling interest in 1995, which then resulted in his role becoming even more marginalized. Wasserman served on the board of directors until 1998. On September 29, 1995, Wasserman was presented with the Presidential Medal of Freedom by President Bill Clinton. In 1996, he was inducted into the Television Hall of Fame.[4]

            Bill Clinton and Casey Wasserman Reveal Secrets of Their Friendship, Philanthropic Bond
           </p>
           <p>
            Cover stars of The Hollywood Reporter's annual Philanthropy Issue, the former president and the mega sports agent -- the latter of whom calls Clinton his philanthropic "mentor" and a "rock star" -- explain when they met, how their bond grew and the unique work they do fighting childhood obesity for the Clinton Foundation.
           </p>
           <p>
            As president, William Jefferson Clinton enjoyed a wider and deeper connection to Hollywood than any chief executive before or since, and he continues to nourish relationships with younger stars and entertainment executives who support his work through his family's Bill, Hillary &amp; Chelsea Clinton Foundation and the Clinton Global Initiative, his annual conference that once again will bring together world leaders Sept. 23 to 26 in New York.
           </p>
           <p>
            Clinton, 66, enjoys a particularly close partnership with Casey Wasserman, chairman and CEO of the L.A.-based Wasserman Media Group, one of the largest sports agencies in the world. Wasserman, who calls Clinton a philanthropic "mentor," has joined him in efforts to combat the nation's childhood obesity epidemic. Recently, both men talked with THR about their commitment to that issue and others.
           </p>
           <p>
            Wasserman has allied his family's Wasserman Foundation with the Clintons in an initiative that sends his company's client athletes into the schools to talk about exercise, health and nutrition. "Casey recognized the power of using athletes as healthy role models to inspire young students to live active lives," explains Clinton. "It's amazing to watch how excited the students are to see them and how strongly the message, when conveyed by a respected sports figure, resonates."
           </p>
           <p>
            Uh Oh.  Somehow I don't think this will work out well for the Children.  Since we now know through research that BC is involved with NEXIVM and the Bronfmans he is possibly mob connected as well.

            The Matsushita sale, which came as Wall Street analysts began to look askance at MCA, was disastrous for Wasserman. Michael Ovitz, described Wasserman knockoff, engineered the deal, and led MCA to believe the Japanese would be passive investors. Instead, they turned around and sold the company to Seagram without consulting Wasserman.

             Amblin' towards Nambla...
..slowly but surely ...that was the Satanists end game..
..the one crime Jesus didnt turn the cheek to..
The one crime where he advocated violence towards the sinner...
            </p>
            <p>
             Judith Barsi should be placed at the top of the anti Satanist movement as a martyr..
From now on her story should be a permenant meme for the anti Satanist movement

              I so agree.  Judith most definitely should almost me a patron saint.  Heather as well.  If these stories ever take hold with the masses, hold on for dear life.

A well done documentary with proceeds and donations donated to the debt reduction of the US treasury...and the US funding it...
One dollar each...worldwide movement

                I recommend a documentary yes.  One like they did on MJ.  But it must be funded.  The danger is that if money is collected those that are guilty of these crimes will do all they can to shut it down.  Possibly someone with a large amount of money that wishes the truth of these vermin pedos to come out.  If this is done, much thought must go into beforehand.  It must be strong enough to withstand their shutdown.

               <p>
                We have a right to stand up for Judith and Heather.  Their voices have been silenced.  But I know that once we begin their souls will be at our side.  They have not been able to rest.  We must take this all the way so they can both,  once and for all RIP.

                 All it costs is a dollar ..decide to deside ur credit to reduce debt...and the US treasury sets off all costs and bills..
At the moment we depend on banks to pay our bills ...by lending to their credit system..
Pledge one dollar..and then instruct the US treasury to both investigate and fund the documentary....
The US is ur Roman accountant..they r binded to ur security and surety ..
..
Email the debt reduction department of the US treasury and confirm whether they will accept one dollar towards debt reductiin in exchange for acknowledging ur surety rights..ie they will from hereon stand by the birth contract name and set off all bills...
..and also confirm that even court charges will be setodf..and that u or the group can investogate and charge individuals under universal jurisdiction...
U as trustee of the Roman trust..have that rigght with the roman birth trust..
                </p>
                <p>
                 It will cost less than a dollar to confirm what i have explained ..by emailing the debt rediction department of the US treasury..
                </p>
                <p>
                 If they agree all u lose is a dollar..if they dont ..then u would have wasted an email..
                </p>
                <p>
                 No harm either way..
                </p>
                <p>
                 Trust me ..they will reply in the positive..
                </p>
                <p>
                 We r in total control..we just choose to lend credit into a war jurisdoction fiction play...
We can choose to reduce debt woth the system iou known as credit..its not our credit..its the credit of the birth trust..what u owe ur mother..settle the account everytime with her..and Rome becomes ur trustee..
In peace..because u are at peace with ur mothers estate..
                </p>
                <p>
                 The US is us..
When we become enemies of our own estate ..the US becpmes our enemy ..both reflect each other to increase debt ...
When we choose to be at peace with our estate the US moves to act as peace maker..not war monger
