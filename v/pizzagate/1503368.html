            <p>
             While the Afghan government claims to have zero tolerance for child abusers in their security forces, Uruzgan government spokesman Dost Mohammad Nayab confirmed that nearly every provincial checkpoint had a bacha. He fears that if they remove child sex slaves, officers will abandon their posts.
            </p>
            <p>
             "It is difficult to separate policemen from their bachas in this security situation," Nayab said.

             I just recently, in the past year, learned of this. Again, I learned something completely new to me &amp; I found out about it from a YouTuber called TL;DR, aka Teal Deer.
            </p>
            <p>
             Coincidentally (I don't think I believe in coincidences anymore) I found this YouTube channel during #GamerGate. #PizzaGate &amp; #GG have taught me so many things... maybe too much at times.
            </p>
            <p>
             But as my new gf
             <em>
              Piper, from Diamond City
             </em>
             likes to say; "I'd rather know an ugly truth than a sweet lie"
            </p>
            <p>
             (Yeah I'm a little behind but my husband just got it for me for my birthday earlier this month ~ &amp; at least I didn't say my new gf's name is Dogmeat ^_^)
            </p>
            <p>
             Anyway, Teal Deer did a great video re this exact subject.
             <em>
              Bacha Bazi
             </em>
             . This video also has a lot of info &amp; statistics etc. on the overall subject of child abuse &amp; child sex trafficking.  So weird that both #PG &amp; #GG have had so many crossover subjects &amp; both movements have seen such dirty ass "journalists" &amp; MSM fumble or outright lie/hide stories.
            </p>
            <p>
             <a href="https://youtu.be/tFew6a_-McU">
              https://youtu.be/tFew6a_-McU
             </a>
            </p>
            <p>
             Also, because several very vocal anti-#GG people were pro-PEDO there were several stories about basically normalization of pedophilia as "a sexual preference" &amp; how "it shouldn't be demonized" (Salon, iirc also huffpo)
            </p>
            <p>
             Along the way a woman who was the victim of child sex trafficking that runs a legitimate (seems that way/have never seen any signs of dirt ball) charity trying quite desperately to help at-risk kids &amp; teens, got involved/stumbled into a Twitter thread where one of the pro-pedo types was SJW-ing like the absolute pieces of shit that they are. This woman was awesome &amp; handled it like a boss.  She also didn't give a flying fuck about what any of the "journalists" in the argument thought &amp; basically read them the riot act too.
            </p>
            <p>
             So I'm mulling over in my mind whether to approach her with this or not. I'm SURE she knows all about it &amp; KNOWS that it's a real life issue &amp; not "a fever dream".
            </p>
            <p>
             In fact I'm pretty sure she
             <em>
              lived
             </em>
             it. I know she was trafficked as a child. I just don't know if she was trafficked to "elite" types or not.
            </p>
            <p>
             She also has some celeb backers, which I realize how shitty that sounds when we know there is a HUGE PEDO (Jolly Green Giant?!  omg, I'm sorry, that was terrible but it popped in my head &amp; I'm tired enough to type it out ~ please forgive) issue in the entertainment industry, but idk, they may lend some support as well as some perceived legitimacy to the movement behind #PizzaGate.
            </p>
            <p>
             Or maybe just approach her (privately) for advice to help us along, to make a few big fucking dents in this awful thing. Maybe even possibly help each other because she is always tweeting about information on how to help, or tweets in real time if there is a child missing  &amp; calls out many of the typical predatory criminals/organizations that take advantage of kids.
            </p>
            <p>
             Maybe I will approach the creator of this forum (kingkongwaswrong, 🍌🐒right? ~_^ haha, sure can tell when I'm getting deliriously tired &amp; silly but God damn it we all need levity now &amp; then!) &amp; ask what they think is a good idea or not.
