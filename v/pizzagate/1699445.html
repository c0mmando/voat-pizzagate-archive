<p>&quot;It was Jill Stein who said Hillary might be the greater evil in a Trump matchup (“Hil­la­ry has the potential to do a whole lot more damage, get us into more wars”), a sentiment shared by actress Susan Sarandon, who told an interviewer she believed that Clinton was “more dangerous” than Trump because she was more hawkish and better able to ram her agenda through Congress. In words I suspect Sarandon wishes she could reel back, she discounted the threat level posed by a Trump presidency: “Seriously, I am not worried about a wall being built . . . . He is not going to get rid of every Muslim in this country.” <strong>She speculated on another occasion that a Trump win might hasten the revolution.</strong> The left’s romance with revolution has always been a reality-blinder, this thermodynamic belief that things need to get bad beyond the breaking point so that people will take the vape pens out of their mouths, rise up, and storm the Bastille. But the history of non-democracies and authoritarian personality cults shows that things can stay bad and get worse for a long time, leaving unhealable wounds. Mao’s China, for example. Putin’s tubercular Russia.&quot;</p>

            Susan is a Mensa level Genius. She is Brilliant. She supported Bernie Sanders and it's now proven Hillary and the Dems stole the nomination from Bernie. Stanford University did research and they proved Hillary stole 12 or 13 states from Bernie in the Democratic Primary race. Bernie would have beaten Trump very easily but Hillary and her evil controllers couldn't let Bernie be the candidate.

             The whole thesis falls apart once you account for the Demographics of the States won by Clinton vs those won by Bernie.  It's embarrassing Bernie folks ever entertained this.
