<p>Now, normally this would be written off as some random occurrence. It would make sense for pedos to be drawn to video game forums, because they could groom children online and no one would catch this. However, there is a Clinton connection through an organization called DIGRA. </p>
<p>Digra originally was a simple think tank, until it was hijacked by several left leaning ivy league academics. The concerning part of this is that many of them are connected to high level democrat politicians, and silicon valley and new york venture capitalists, and in some cases terror groups.. Anita sarkesian was connected to DIgra, and it was from this connection that she was able to get into the &quot;twitter trust and safety council&quot;. Keep in mind that the CEO of twitter is a friend of the Clintons, and did fund raising for Hillary.
It seems that every 3-6 months someone connected to a video game forum, or to digra is arrested for Child Pornography.
Digra is an international organization, and it appears to be used for networking and moving money and ideology around the world in the tech industry. I am noticing patterns forming between &quot;game developers&quot; who are also &quot;artists&quot; and the art grants that they are getting. People with no experience in programing but who are &quot;artists&quot; are getting large sums of money to fail on projects. This money hit a peak before the election, and died down after it. So it appeared that they where funneling both federal and foreign government grants into the Clinton campaign via these artists.</p>
<p>It appears that this was an obscure means to launder money into the Clinton campaign, and these same money laundering artists are either pedos, or friends with pedos, or in communities with a lot of pedos.
This is something that merits more scrutiny from the community.</p>

<p>About Omidyar in this post: <a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/2614904">The Hampstead children and Ricky Dearman turn up at the 2017 Ebay Business Awards</a></p>

<p>Yoichi Shimatsu  believes that Pierre Omidyar is connected to the Bahai faith which is directly linked with the United Nations and their Agenda 21.</p>
<p>He hints at Luciferianism:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Are these cultists devil worshippers? To put things more charitably, the Bahai along with the Illuminati put highest esteem on pure reason (in rejection of the charismatic nature a and capricious will of a God who imposes tough rules on mankind.) Lucifer, without his terrifying image as Satan, is an adamant hero who teaches humans to be proud of themselves, to stand tall and not to grovel before a morally oppressive and restrictive divinity of the orthodox priesthood. A defender of reason, Lucifer can therefore be the rightful God of mankind to one who is a heretic deviating from Judeo-Christian-Islamic tradition. Illuminati of the Oxford Movement </p>
<p><strong>It is no odd coincidence then that veneration of the evening star is shared by the seemingly disconnected cults of Illuminism and Bahai</strong> The historical links between these two cults can be found in Hermano Maximiliano’s “Freemasonry, the British Empire and the Formation of the Baha’I Cult”. In a cultural crusade to preserve British imperial power, a group of elite academics formed the Oxford Movement, which promoted radical new religious leaders across the Muslim world, particularly Bahai founder Bahaullah. (The Roman Empire underestimated the growing influence of religions from the Orient, including Christianity, which led to its collapse, and the Oxford Movement was determined to avoid that fatal ideological mistake.} </p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>The logo for Guide Star caught my eye, as I\'ve noticed that a number of monitoring trafficking organisations use the northern star as a theme within their logo or name. Polaris being another one.</strong> I am vaguely aware that this northern star theme also has an esoteric meaning, as well as being important to the Navy because of obvious navigation themed connections.</p>
<p>Guide Star was started by Arther &quot;Buzz&quot; Schmidt. Here is an article with his attendance at Guide Star Korea. In the article photos, please notice the logo behind him..

            Their dashboard has lists of kids in the communities by LGBTQ  and their gender  and  skin color/ethnicity   WHAT FOR?  broken down to how many sleep outdoors .  This is about homeless kids.
           </p>
           <p>
            Dashboard was first used and invented by David Plouff  who worked on Obama's first campaign.  That list was HUGE and broke people down too.  Did that facilitate their trafficking?

            It was during the GamerGate scandal that I first learned of the Cultural Marxist media's attempt to normalise paedophilia.  The number of SJWs pushing the false 'Goobergrape muhsoggykees harassing wammenz' narrative who were also either paedophiles or paedophile apologists was disconcerting, to say the least.

             Well of course, one is pretty obvious, Fiona Barnett and then I recognize Steve Koch of Real Estate.  Barnett has a Vineyard, did not know that.  Are they saying Barnett should be  suspect?  I am not going to like this if she is a fake, and I'm not saying she is. Since her name is on the top I would imagine she is a big player in this child org.

               OMG.  That would be a weird coincidence.  An almost impossible one.  How can it be that there just happens to be one with a kid's org. on top of it.

               I don't remember either, but you are correct, for as I was writing my comment, I kept thinking some believer her to be fake.  I always believe victims that come forward unless there are immediate telltale signs.  But this will be a huge disappointment if she is not who she says she is.  Dear me.

                 Oh yes, I can't remember his name either.  We should never ban people just because we don't agree with their views, unless they are in the pedo realm.  We have a lot to learn from some with different perspectives.  If his father is a whistleblower then he comes from good stock.  Well, this will be interesting looking her up.

                     Me too.  What we have to do I believe is check out this org.  If it reeks, then well, she may too. Maybe she is not that involved.  I am giving her benefit of doubt, like all victims.

                         Wow.  Well, it looks like the armed services are on board with this propaganda.  This comes from the top. I would imagine those in the service are more aligned with him, but they will prob not let him gather signatures or org. a group.  This is like NAZI Camp.

                          says it's a thought crime to be against gay men showing their penises to little boys on the street. It shouldn't be a crime to oppose pedophilia. You decide!

                   Luke Ledgerd McKee, also known by his online handles VGB-OPSEC and Hojuruku, is an Australian IT Freelancer and former English Teacher living in Vietnam after facing legal trouble in his homeland after obtaining private information about members of the police force illegally. He is notable online for his fringe, conspiracy theory-driven political views, incoherent typing style, and paranoia about pedophiles.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   Luke claims that he is being persecuted by a conspiracy of Homosexual Activists, Satan Worshipers, and Jews that control the Australian Police force so they can stop his activism in exposing their attempts to legalize pedophilia and bestiality. In Luke's mind a man named Garry Burns is at the head of this conspiracy[1], which also involves a man called Jez Smith, as well as members of GamerGate and Kiwi Farms[2], the latter of which hosts a thread chronicling him and his father, and their online activities[3], most of it consisting of his posts trying to convince the users that he is in the right. It is this delusion of persecution that drives Luke's online posting habits.

                   He had some serious issues, and by that I mean, that he had some horrible family situation with his son.  I am thinking someone took his child and the police refused to help him or something similar.  There were some really nasty things that happened to him.  This can drive anyone to possibly not tell their story just how we would want.  Many ostracized him, I and GreenDell tried to help him in formatting etc.  but it was to no avail.  I think that there are worse people on here. Anyone pushing their pedo propaganda should be banned, not those reaching out for help.  That is why we are here, to help. He may also have been abused, we do not know.

                  Your so right ! No one should be banned unless they are pedos . Some people are seriously messed up from what they’ve endured and sometimes they post frantically ( I’ve done it ) because they are so eager to get the info out there and know that it’s true ( because they are eye witnesses)

            The Baha'i religion seems to attract many people who used to regard themselves as atheists, and many academics (from my observation). Had never heard about the 'Oxford Movement'. Interesting.

             I don't put all people into a bad camp that follow the Baha'i faith, for there are clueless people in all faiths, not knowing that their faith has been infiltrated with suspect leaders.  And yes, it could be that atheists that are still looking for a peaceful answer may be attracted.  There are those that are still looking for an answer, and I believe they don't think of it as organized religion, which it really is.  Also those that are disenchanted with the RCC or Christian Holy Roller Joel Osteen types.

                 Ursa Major (/ˈɜːrsə ˈmeɪdʒər/; also known as the Great Bear) is a constellation in the northern sky, whose associated mythology likely dates back into prehistory.[1] Its Latin name means "greater (or larger) she-bear", standing as a reference to and in direct contrast with nearby Ursa Minor, the lesser bear.

               He spoke about this in his inaugural address: " I have spoken of a thousand points of light, of all the community organizations that are spread like stars throughout the Nation, doing good. We will work hand in hand, encouraging, sometimes leading, sometimes being led, rewarding. We will work on this in the White House, in the Cabinet agencies. I will go to the people and the programs that are the brighter points of light, and I will ask every member of my government to become involved. The old ideas are new again because they are not old, they are timeless: duty, sacrifice, commitment, and a patriotism that finds its expression in taking part and pitching in "

               A thousand points of light, the occult references.  Nancy Reagan followed the stars, I think this was also a time the occult and stars were already in the WH.  Lucifer was present in more ways than we know.  Tate and Sandusky, Oh My.  This is so telling.  My head will explode.  And when will this man drop dead?  Now is a good time.  He looks like a gargoyle.

              <blockquote>
               <p>
                C.S. Lewis’ Chronicles of Narnia are recommended by the makers of Dungeon’s &amp; Dragons and are (were) sold in occult bookstores. His imagery is designed to fool the Christian reader while at the same time “enlightening” those initiated in the occult, witchcraft and Luciferianism. Since Satan’s religions are counterfeits of God’s truth, it was, to some extent “easy” for Lewis to pull this off.
In the “creation” of Narnia some very revealing things come up.
               </p>
               <p>
                On p. 99 , speaking of the “creation” of the stars it says, “One moment there had been nothing but darkness; next moment a thousand, thousand points of light leaped out — single stars, constellations, and planets, brighter and bigger than any in our world. There were no clouds.”
The phrase “a thousand, thousand points of light” leaps out at us! The fact that Lewis would use this expression is bizarre at the very least, but it points to something much more sinister.

                Alice Bailey, the Theosophist/Luciferian and co-founder of Lucis Trust and the Arcane School, in her 1957 book The Externaliztion of the Hierarchy tells us exactly what a Point of Light is. “…[T]he men who comprise the occult leadership group known as the New Group of World Servers. These individuals, she remarks are in service to ‘the work of the Brotherhood…the Forces of Light.’ They are the ones who are to usher all of mankind from the darkness of outmoded Christianity and faded nationalism into the bright and shining ‘New World Order.'”
