<h2>Cardinal Daniel DiNardo, of Galveston-Houston, said the delay was requested by the Holy See, which asked that the US bishops wait until after a Vatican-convened global meeting on sex abuse in February.</h2>
<h1>The bishops are meeting in Baltimore and had been expected to consider several steps to combat abuse, including a new code of conduct for themselves and the creation of a special commission to review complaints against the bishops.</h1>
<p>In his address opening the bishops’ assembly, DiNardo told survivors of clergy abuse that he was “deeply sorry”.</p>
<p><em>Of course he is sorry. As usual. /s</em></p>
<h1>The church, he said, should not revictimize survivors “by demanding they heal on our timeline”.</h1>
<p><em>Well, then just don\'t do it.</em></p>
<p>DiNardo expressed disappointment at the delay on the vote but also told the US bishops: “I remain hopeful that this additional consultation will ultimately improve our response to the crisis we face.”</p>
<p><strong>The delay in the voting drew some skeptical and critical reactions.</strong></p>

<p>“We had this agenda, we were moving forward on these documents, this was our goal,” said <strong>Bishop Christopher Coyne</strong>, of the Vermont diocese of Burlington, and the communications chair for the three-day conference. “And now … it will look like we don’t have to come up with much.”</p>
<p>Coyne said he believed there were “no machinations” leading to the delay, but he had concerns about how it would be perceived outside the assembly hall.</p>
<p>“The Vatican just made a big mistake in asking US bishops to delay their votes on clergy abuse protocols,” tweeted <strong>John Gehring</strong>, the Catholic program director at Faith in Public Life, a Washington-based clergy network.</p>

            Vatican has been bankrupt to mammom worshippers like fuggers and medici merchants since 1500s..
The only legitimacy they have is that of holding on to our birth trusts and running their merchant debt game for their merchants of venice...they r puppet administrators of the mammon worshippers..
..
They dont even have a clue waht theur rituals mean as accounting code...and the baptism ceremony..
I talked to a few ..
They r some of thenmost idiotic people i have ever come across..
..
Its tue merchants whonunderstand the accounting code of the rituals ..which they have secularised in modern day statutue law..
Baptism has become the birth certificate...
So is the rest of the seven sacraments ..
..
The real priests are the secular priests of the court system that operates statutue law..
..
Vatican has no power other than employing brain dead mafia goons to do the dirtyy work of the deep state ..while the media mela that u see show the illusion of governance that the deep state needs as cover to run the debt staate..
The deep state is not rogue..
It IS the real govt of the merchants of venice , who run it on ur pound of flesh ...only in this comedy of errors u volunteer ur pound of flesh ie the birth certificate which is tue r3ceipt to that pound of flesh u vilunteer to the debt deep state ..

           </p>
           <p>
            They need more time to think about what can be done about the ongoing abuse pandemic??
           </p>
           <p>
            For starters, don't cover up abuse allegations, which has been done regularly by All of them, up to and including the Vatican.
In fact, it is ordered at the highest level -in writing- that all sexual abuse allegations ARE to be covered up.
           </p>
           <p>
            Excuse me, I'm livid. And not shocked in the slightest.

             In  this article about new bones, pay attention to Arcudi.  How many times does he try to mention the age 25?  Hm?  How many times does he try to put doubt into it being the Orlandi girl?  Arcudi came through for the Vatican once before

             Vatican City, Aug 29, 2015 / 10:48 am (CNA/EWTN News).- Initial autopsy findings indicate that disgraced former apostolic nuncio Jozef Wesolowski died of natural causes from a “cardiac event,” the Vatican announced Saturday.
            </p>
            <p>
             The laicized archbishop was awaiting trial by the Vatican court for possessing child pornography and sexual abuse of minors when he died late Thursday evening at the age of 67.
            </p>
            <p>
             Wesolowski's death prompted the Office of the Vatican’s Promoter of Justice, also known as the Vatican prosecutor, to order an autopsy..
            </p>
            <p>
             According to a Vatican statement released Aug. 29, the autopsy was conducted Friday afternoon. Based on “preliminary conclusions from the macroscopic exam,” the autopsy “confirmed the natural cause of death, attributable to a cardiac event,” the statement said.
            </p>
            <p>
             Prof. Giovanni Arcudi, Professor of Forensic Medicine at the University of Rome Tor Vergata, was appointed to coordinate the three experts conducting the autopsy.
            </p>
            <p>
             Wesoleski was awaiting a criminal trial in Vatican City on charges of pornography and pedophilic acts.
            </p>
            <p>
             In 2013 the then-archbishop faced allegations of sexual misconduct and he resigned as apostolic nuncio to the Dominican Republic. A 13-year-old boy alleged that Wesolowski had solicited him for sexual favors in exchange for money.
            </p>
            <p>
             The archbishop faced a canonical trial in a tribunal of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith. In 2014, the tribunal found him guilty of sexual abuse and subjected him to laicization, which meant he was unable to celebrate the sacraments.
            </p>
            <p>
             How convenient.
            </p>

             I tried to post this but 3 times I went through the whole long process, and the page turned white and it disappeared.  Thank you for bringing this up.

                A lot of Vatican scandals/information don't make it out of italian press.

               <p>
                But you can search italian newspapers for "francesco" or "bergoglio"

               </p>
               <p>
                "One thing is certain - concluded Pietro Orlandi at Radio Cusano Campus -
                <strong>
                 Pope Francis knows what happened to Emanuela, as the Pope Emeritus Benedict XVI knows, as John Paul II knew it. The very fact that Bergoglio, when the investigation was still open, told me
                 <em>
                  'Emanuela is in heaven'
                 </em>
                </strong>
                means that he knows what happened to Emanuela. Not by chance after he told me that phrase, the wall of silence rose further: I never received from the Pope an answer, an explanation, a meeting, a signal, a word, despite my many requests advanced to his secretary . Evidently after 35 years there is still something that weighs heavily on the image of the Church ".
