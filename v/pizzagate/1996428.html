<p>Russian adoptions have been in the U.S. headlines for the last few days because of the sensational news of the meeting in Trump Tower last summer between Donald Trump, Jr., and Natalia Veselnitskaya, a Russian attorney who claimed to be lobbying influential Americans for the restart of Russian adoptions in the U.S. which were banned <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dima_Yakovlev_Law">in 2012 by Puti</a>n in what many observers believed was retaliation for the Magnitsky Act.</p>
<p>Why the female Russian lawyer was so intent on restarting the &quot;popular&quot; Russian adoption program in the U.S. is puzzling since it is general knowledge that Russian adoptions in the U.S., despite the huge number of them with over 58,000 Russian adoptions in about two decades from 1995 to 2013, were fraught with problems. Russian orphans became notorious for having psychological and health problems and adoptive parents were poorly trained and completely unprepared to deal with their adoptees\' difficult behavioral issues. Many Russian adoptees ended up in state mental institutions. Russian authorities blamed US adoptive parents for the deaths of 19 children.</p>
<p>Russian Foreign Minister <a href="https://www.rferl.org/a/russia-adoption-ban-lavrov/24898056.html">Sergei Lavrov </a>said in Feb. 2013, that</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;the U.S. is the only country from which we get genuinely alarming reports about how many families treat our children. And I use the word &quot;many&quot; intentionally,&quot; he added.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Lavrov explained that</p>
<blockquote>
<p>the number of cases is believed to be far greater since American families change the names of Russian adoptees, making it impossible for Moscow to track them.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In fact, a year after the Dimi Yakovlev Law was passed, the Russian govt. launched a criminal probe into online trafficking of Russian children in the U.S. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Investigative Committee spokesperson Vladimir Markin said the case was started due to a journalistic investigation by Reuters and NBC initiated in September.According to investigators, illegal markets were created in the US on Yahoo and Facebook websites, on which illicit transactions concerning children adopted by US citizens were performed,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>He added that, following the reports, the committee had checked the information and decided to open a criminal case on human trafficking involving minors.</p>
<p>Thus, among others, transactions involving 26 underage Russian citizens were made and moreover, it was established that as the result of the deals some of them were sexually abused,” Markin said.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Reuters investigative report, filed Sept. 9, 2013, entitled &quot;Americans use the Internet to abandon children adopted from overseas&quot; is here: <a href="http://www.reuters.com/investigates/adoption/#article/part1">http://www.reuters.com/investigates/adoption/#article/part1</a></p>
<p>Lavrov has said the Russian govt is <a href="https://www.rt.com/politics/lavrov-gay-marriage-france-adoption-662/">working on a database</a> of Russian children adopted in the U.S. to monitor Russian adoptees until the age of 18. <a href="https://www.rt.com/politics/159868-russian-children-adoptions-abroad/">He also announced </a>that Russian MPs intend to ban changing of citizenship of adopted Russian kids over fears that NGOs specializing in adoptions might send children to the United States via third party countries.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Despite the fact that we are no longer sending orphans for adoption to US families,** the USA has not given up on its policy of purchases of children. If we fail to impose a legal ban on the shipping of children across the ocean, they will transport them through third countries,” State Duma deputy Yevgeniy Fyodorov (United Russia) has told the mass circulation daily, Izvestia.**</p>
<p>“The growing number of registered foreign NGOs [specializing in adoptions] is a direct proof that the transit of Russian children to the United States is growing,” the politician added.</p>

            It makes you think she was working on behalf of someone, other than the Russians, who wanted Russian children to flow back into the United States to available for 'adoption'.  Now who would that be?

            Russians had pizzagate nailed years ago...they have been hunkered down and waiting for the world to change since.  We should pay attention to Russia and follow their lead.  They are basically saying...We stopped adoptions to the US because you were killing our children...

             Or they were no longer willing to send their children over to be abused playthings of deviant rich sick people. Not that they all are but I bet many of them were.

            I remember reading about the adoptions and the articles were horrible. Sometimes the blame was put on the Russian orphanages or on the Birth Parents because they said that a lot of Russians drank so much their little brains were damaged.  But I thought this can't be with every case.  I just felt so sorry for the little children.  Now of course I realize what was really happening  Some people were adopting and abusing or they were adopting and selling or shipping the children to others  Our country and leaders should hang their heads in shame for what was done to those poor little children.  I cannot blame Putin for retaliating.  He had every right.
