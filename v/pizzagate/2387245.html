Christian was 14 and Matthew was nine when Christian began sexually assaulting him. Christian started at 14 raping the neighborhood children. As he got older he kept raping Matthew and even new children. I will summarize the article by the most important pieces.</p>

<p>&quot;CK did often hurt me physically, belittle me and make threats against my life, but I suppose where the underlying difference between a stereotypical neighborhood bully and that of someone like CK is the constant rape that I, and other children endured by this individual for nearly a decade.</p>
<p>Aside from what I could refer to as “normal” sexual acts, between two consenting adults, CK had myself and other children preform strange and unusual acts. Whether it was “stretching exercises” in where he would take turns pulling out our genitals as far as they could reach, standing in line swinging our genitals as he masturbated, increasing our tolerance for testicular torture, playing video games as I performed oral sex on this man, and forcing me to preform cunnalingus on a young girl as she attempted to scream for help. Her screams were met by CKs hands, dragging her by her hair and down an entire flight of steps, as she attempted to escape. He was clearly dangerous and capable of severe physical harm. CK would always tell us if we told an adult, he would kill us. I believed him.</p>
<p>I specifically remember one-time CK sat us down in front of a drawing he sketched of a underground dungeon, with many different rooms and compartments all designed for his sexual fantasies. We were told we\'d start construction in the following days; forced labor. Alike slaves, we were forced to dig at his parents’ property in Mt. Kisco, which was a conservation sanctuary, called Marsh Sanctuary (the family has since left this property).  Needless to say, a small group of children with shovels were not able to complete his sexual dungeon and we were sexually assaulted again for our poor efforts&quot;</p>
<p>I contacted CK’s father, also on a recorded line.  He admitted to knowing about what CK had done to me ,“…you are not telling me anything I didn’t already know about,” said his father&quot;</p>
<p>Presently* on CK’s own public social media pages he is doing “throw backs” to the 80s, with references to him playing the same entertainment systems he raped me and others to; there are pictures of him holding a small child and one of his victims is commenting on a post with the child. </p>
<p>This is the video of Matthew as an adult confronting Christian and his father on the phone. </p>

<p>Matthew said Christian was trying to build a child rape torture dungeon at Marsh Memorial Sanctuary. He said multiple children were being sexually assaulted while being forced to build it but they failed. That quote with his father &quot;tell me something I don\'t know&quot; and having child slaves at Marsh along with knowing about the sexual abuse means their in on it. Now let\'s talk about Marsh Memorial Sanctuary.</p>
<p>This is a huge place that stills runs to this day. It\'s a huge public nature reserve. It holds large festivals for New Yorkers as well.</p>

<p>I believe that\'s Christian Kriegeskotte. On Facebook &quot;Christian Pace&quot; hanging out with the kids. Very similar nose structure.</p>

<p>&quot;Christian Pace&quot;</p>
<p>I could be wrong but looking at his nose. There is a bump on it\'s right side that all those pictures seem to have.</p>

<p>If that is the case Christian is still involved with Marsh Memorial Sanctuary. His parents started Marsh Memorial Sanctuary and knew their son was raping kids and keeping them imprisoned there. They have since left Marsh. Rather selling it or still owning it, it does not say.</p>
<p>Something\'s off about this place. I think it might be a pedophiles sanctuary.</p>',

           Aside from what I could refer to as “normal” sexual acts, between two consenting adults, CK had myself and other children preform strange and unusual acts.

           I believe that's Christian Kriegeskotte. On Facebook "Christian Pace" hanging out with the kids. Very similar nose structure.

           "Christian Pace"
          </p>
          <p>
           I could be wrong but looking at his nose. There is a bump on it's right side that all those pictures seem to have.

           If that is the case Christian is still involved with Marsh Memorial Sanctuary. His parents started Marsh Memorial Sanctuary and knew their son was raping kids and keeping them imprisoned there. They have since left Marsh. Rather selling it or still owning it, it does not say.
          </p>
          <p>
           Something's off about this place. I think it might be a pedophiles sanctuary.

Polly In A Porny - Poem by Shel Silverstein
Autoplay next video
Haha I kissed Polly goodnight haha as we stood at her front door
Now she's quite a proper lady so I didn't ask for anything more
But haha I was feeling oh so groovie that I went down to the movie
And I sat down and guess just what I saw
           </p>
           <p>
            I saw Polly in a porny down at the dirty flicks
I saw Polly in a porny I didn't know she knew them tricks
What I seen nearly struck me blind I never knew she was the artically inclined
I saw Polly in a porny with a pony and I've nearly blowed my mind
Was she gallopin' (no no no) oh was she trottin' (no no no)
Oh was she riding across the country with some tall dark handsome person
Oh was she wearin' her cowboy hat haha well not exactly that
But at least I recall she had her spurs on
I love ol' Polly in a porny I keep on going back
Yeah in the very last row I'm singin' low with my coat bouncin' in my lap ooh
I spend each dime I can afford I swear she's gonna win an academy award
I saw Polly in a porny with a pony and the pony seemed a little bored
Ooh oh ride Polly ride slide Polly slide

            I think you have some stuff messed up.  I don't think anyone lived on the property.
It's not owned by a family but a nonprofit.  Christian Pace is the director of the non profit.
           </p>
           <p>
            Christian Pace - Director
           </p>
           <p>
            Christian was born and raised in Westchester, but has worked as a biologist high in the mountain marshes of Idaho,  down in the bayous of rural Louisiana, and in the Adirondack Park in northern New York.
           </p>
           <p>
            He is not some Hollywood composer.
           </p>
           <p>
            Outdoor sports, travel, and recreation have always been a core interest for Christian, so when the opportunity to assist the Marsh Sanctuary with re-establishing their trail system, developing new programs, and planning  for the future, he could not pass up the chance. 
"The Marsh Sanctuary is a inspiring piece of open space, full of surprising and unique features.  It's a pleasure to introduce, or re-introduce, people to this local treasure that is just hiding under their noses."
           </p>
           <p>
            Christian has a degree in Environmental and Forest Biology from SUNY-ESF/Syracuse University

             Ok, so the father used to be the director of the sanctuary.   So the connection is there and perhaps they used to llive on that property is next to it.
            </p>
            <p>
             But I think you're wrong about Christian Pace.  In the audiotape with the father, we learn that Matthew Lazarus parents are still friends with the Kriegeskottes.   If Christian Kriegeskotte was living in his home town under a new name.  I think Matthew Lazarus would know that.
            </p>
            <p>
             Matthew Lazerus is not claiming the sanctuary is trun by pedophiles, but that one boy associated with it abused him and others.

               The OP had a theory about Pace that he removed from his original post.
              </p>
              <p>
               I think OP is going way beyond what the evidence says.  He says CK's father knew at the time this was going on, but the phone call video shows the opposite.    There's nothing that point this going beyond CK.

                The only thing that points this going beyond CK is that CK was 14 or so when he raped children
Certainly, 100% he was raped by someone else.
There were other fairly wealthy children that were raped in that sanctuary. I know a few Westchester families

            This is a Stupendous Find!  I say that it has been Hiding in Plain Sight like many others.  Waiting to be found.  You have really done a very detailed report.  Imo, you have presented a very incriminating dossier so to speak.  This person has possibly hooked up with SS and GL since he is already involved in these very famous works.  I also propose that a 14 yr old does not just wake up one morning and start raping children.  He has also been brutally raped.  Pedophile Rapists are not born, they are created.  UpVoat4U!!!

              Was thinking this as well, since there were connections with children going way back to the grandparents even.  It's really disgusting.  It also mentioned Michael Eisner.

              sent me an article about how they managed the takeover of Disney from it's founder Walt.  Amazing.  I can't relate a lot of it because it was so convoluted and detailed, but I must say they were tenacious and never ending in their pursuit of Hollywood and Film Making.  They were after the inventions of Edison, it goes way back.  Shocking.  They finally achieved their goal.  Bank of America was also involved.

            When reading Matthew's blog, this stood out to me:
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             I found out that the district attorney cannot press charges against CK
             <strong>
              because of an old antiquated statute of limitations law.
             </strong>
            </p>
            <p>
             I suppose the good news is the law was changed in approximately 2005, however, it is not retroactive.
            </p>
            <p>
             The last correspondence I had from law enforcement was on November 8, 2017 at 8:52AM Central Time, from Detective David Whitney at the Westchester County special victim’s unit:

            <p>
             <em>
              I am sorry but I have been advised that we will not be conducting any further investigations due to the time that has passed and no incidents or victims that have come forward that are within the time limits of the law.

            Shocked! These people out there fighting this stuff by themselves, its a God send that pizzagate is now a whole community effort to expose these hateful evil people.  It must bring some comfort for them knowing they are not alone in the fight anymore!

            I have been following this story for months.  Matt had a public Facebook profile for a few months - then it disappeared. He had posted a picture of Christian in the White House.  It appeared it was a guest of Obama.   Also he said the name of one of the victims was his sister, Isa.    If you google her, she is a celebrity seamstress- works with big names in Hollywood.
           </p>
           <p>
            Also, on another post in voat, Christian is a Freemason and a member of Lodge 45 in PA.   Christian is actually on their website in the about section.

             Also- he posted emails from SONY addresses to him which discredited his claims.   Guys name was McCool or something.  James maybe? Odd name.

             Also one of his posts talked about Sarles Street.   Mariah Carey and her ex SONT executive husband live there.   Donald Trump lives there.   The CEO of Chase lives there now.    And Marsh Sanctuary backs all these 20+ million dollar estates.

                This is no mistake, my Brothers, and the careful study of Scientific Astrology will yield many personal revelations to the introspective individual. It is also quite intentional, my Brothers, that toward the conclusion of each of our degrees the candidate is positioned in the North-East corner of the Lodge Room, which is symbolic of the terminus or meridian of total darkness (from which he has emerged) and illumination. The word “meridian” here has a dual meaning as well, as the traditional medicine of the Orient utilizes this term to identify the twelve special pathways in the body, along which vital energy is believed to travel. The number twelve itself, may also be associated with the Solar Year (in months) and the signs of the Zodiac, through which the Sun and planets travel. This further illustrates the relationship between the Macrocosm and the Microcosm, which has already been explained. I would expect the phrase “From darkness to light,” now to hold a much greater meaning to each of us, when we witness a candidate receiving instruction from this North-Eastern vantage. On a more profound level, as our Masonic journey represents our symbolic birth onto the path toward spiritual enlightenment, it is in the North-East corner of the Lodge that we emerge from the darkness of the womb into the light of our new spiritual Universe. It is for this reason that in many traditional English Lodges, the more experienced brethren are often seated in the South, while the newly initiated members are seated in the North. My Brothers, each time you enter the Lodge, please remember these few points, as they will surely unlock truths within your own being with very little effort, as they were intended to do. As the great Masonic writer W. L. Wilmhurst, author of “The Meaning of Masonry,” points out: we should not seek merely what it is that Masonry means, but what Masonry is capable of teaching us.

             At the time, there were reports that the Times board had leaned toward endorsing Obama, but was overruled by then-chairman and publisher Arthur Sulzberger Jr., whose family controlled the paper. Sulzberger’s cousins and Times Company directors, Lynn Dolnick and Michael Golden, chaired the New York Times Neediest Cases Fund in 2008.

              Donald Trump is going after a Mexican billionaire to attack The New York Times
             </a>
            </p>
            <blockquote>
             <p>
              Donald Trump plans to invoke Mexican billionaire Carlos Slim to advance his claim that the news media and other global figures are trying to sink his campaign, according to The Wall Street Journal.
             </p>
             <p>
              Slim and his foundation have given $250,000 to $500,000 to Clinton's foundation, according to The Journal.
             </p>
             <p>
              Slim also gave a $250 million loan to The Times in 2009 and owns 17% of the newspaper's public shares, though the Ochs-Sulzberger family owns most of a private class of shares that give it control over the company.
             </p>
             <p>
              "Carlos Slim is an excellent shareholder who fully respects boundaries regarding the independence of our journalism," New York Times publisher Arthur Sulzberger Jr. told The Journal. "He has never sought to influence what we report."

             Great finds. Eisner is from Mt Kisco.
One thing though is that rich people wiill stay rich and are more likely become CEOs etc.
So anyone from Westchester is not a surprise.

              Yes Boy scouts are a breeding ground for pedophiles.
Their manual says you must stay LOYAL to the pack.  What easy targets young boys that pledge allegiance to predators!

               While my scouts was in a foreign land, they require "father" participation. Along with fees and equipment my dad vetted with a critical eye.

               The boy scouts of America is most likely a lost cause in not only urban blight area's, but even in conservative strong holds who are going left of Socialist pig shit mixed with Kool Aid.

              <p>
               Why a supposed conservative organ would side against families having control of their entertainment consumption is beyond curious. The most revealing aspect is the claim in the letter that, “For more than a decade since the enactment of the Family Movie Act, there have been no disputes or litigation over the operation of filtering services that enable individuals to use technology to automate the skipping and muting of content they consider offensive in the home.”
              </p>
              <p>
               This is patently laughable.

             I want to know that as well. It doesn't clarify that on the blog but says at the end contact the lawyer for all screenshots and copies. Wondering if there is a picture of Christian Kriegeskotte at the White House similar to James Alefantis.

            He is a 'big Hollywood composer' - I wonder how the people in the industry will react to these allegations. This should be spread on Twitter - via Hastags like #MeToo, #KidsToo, #Pedogate, #pizzagate and others.
           </p>
           <p>
            We recently talked about children who rape other children - remember the thread about the two ten year old boys who tortured and murdered toddler James Bulger in Britain about 25 years ago? Unfortunately, this isn't uncommon. And from what I've read, survivors are even more reluctant to speak up when the perp was another child/teenager, they are even more ashamed then.

             Think, there is something very off about this James Bulger story.
            </p>
            <p>
             Knowing what we know now, I firmly believe there is more to this story  than just those two kids. I know the UK will not hear anything negative about this case and so it is tough.
            </p>
            <p>
             Its also very strange that this young boy who died had the same name as Whitey Bulger, who was once the world's most wanted man.

             I think his family is hiding something...especially if he was raping and torturing little kids as a teenager. When I was a teenager I was one of those people who had to stop himself from saying sorry over everything. I wanted to be a nice person to everyone. I can't imagine being a psychopath like that. Especially at just 14 raping and torturing younger children. Just sadistic
