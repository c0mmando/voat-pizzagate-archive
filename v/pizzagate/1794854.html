            From the Michael Jackson Fox website; looking for Ashkenazi Jewish bloodlines for research:
Seeking Objective Measures for New Parkinson's Disease Treatments
           </p>
           <p>
            by  Elizabeth Joyce,	
July 16, 2014
           </p>
           <p>
            The Parkinson's Progression Markers Initiative (PPMI) is MJFF's flagship clinical study to identify biomarkers, or indicators, of Parkinson's disease. The study is going on at 32 sites worldwide, including the University of California at San Diego. The San Diego Jewish Journal spoke with PPMI's principal investigator at UCSD, Dr. Douglas Galasko, about the study's investigation of the LRRK2 gene and the promise of genetics and biomarkers for Parkinson's research.
           </p>
           <p>
            Below is an excerpt. You can also read the full article online.
           </p>
           <p>
            Shortly after researchers determined that LRRK2 is the most significant gene in causing Parkinson's disease, they discovered that in people with Ashkenazi Jewish backgrounds, it was an even stronger predictor. Ashkenazi Jewish people are more likely to carry the gene (30-60 out of 100) and of the five-10 percent of people who have genetic causes of Parkinson's, 15-20 percent of them are Ashkenazi. Because of this, Dr. Galasko and the team at the Michael J. Fox Foundation are specifically looking for Ashkenazi Jews to participate in their genetic study.
           </p>
           <p>
            "By identifying milestones within a very well characterized group of people who are LRRK2 carriers," he continues, "we may be able to identify markers that we can then generalize to a lot of other people who may be at risk for Parkinson's."
           </p>
           <p>
            Across the United States, the study is hoping to enroll 250 people with the LRRK2 gene who have Parkinson's disease and 250 people who are carriers but do not have Parkinson's. Their data will be added to the more than 600 people who are currently enrolled in the PPMI study on the non-genetic side of the equation. Ultimately, they will have a database of well-characterized genetic information that will be used to create new treatments and ultimately maybe cure the disease.
           </p>
           <p>
            "We stand at a point where treatment studies are being planned to try to delay onset of certain types of symptoms," Galasko says, "or perhaps to slow progression, but we really need objective measurements to help us initiate these trials and measure their outcomes."
           </p>
           <p>
            PPMI seeks to identify biomarkers of Parkinson's disease to give researchers the objective measurements they need to carry out studies of disease-modifying treatments. Visit the PPMI genetics page to find out if you may be eligible to participate in this important research.

            pizzagate is the only thing (other than human free will) the eilte have not been able to control.. exposing the truth about pizzagate to the world is what will hurt the elite...
           </p>
           <p>
            all believers know prayer makes a difference also.. pray for the miracles to keep happening.. this is the only time in history the elite have been played by mankind.. we have to maximize this unprecedented opportunity to expose them to the world, so the world can wake up...

             FS is awesome!  However, I don't recommend his later (post-incarceration) works.  He has been compromised ever since they threw him into federal prison on trumped-up charges for revealing too much.

            You think too much like a human. You will never defeat human predators by thinking like the prey. You have to transform yourself and start thinking like either a demon or a chimera. The only thing that will destroy a predator of humans is a predator of the predator of humans- and that means abandoning all things that make you prey. If you are unwilling to make that transformation then figure out how best to embrace the human predator's control of you.

              It is enough for students to be like their teachers, and servants like their masters. If the head of the house has been called Beelzebul, how much more the members of his household!

              My teacher is Her, with many names for my house is the mountain top. My master is Death. I am above neither, but the one who comes after me will perfect both.

            That is why it is imperative that we change the system in a way that is inhospitable to them. It's like knowing there are rats in the basement somewhere but instead of tackling them straight on, you deprive them of the environment in which they thrive!

             Abolishing the federal reserve is a good start imo. Along with the imf and world bank. The US breaking ties with the UN, NATO , etc. Putting term limits on congress and others to put an end to career politicians. Ending the cia.  I'm sure I'm missing some, but I think most of these - especially ending the fed is absolutely essential. Get rid of their cheddar, and the rats will starve

               vpulling down the federal reserve would help, but it is impossible, everybody who came near to it was shot / is missing. ...sadly but true, if the massas continue to be stupid and follow the capitalistic system without using their brain there wont be any change.
The masses are manipulated since history is written and it will always be a little part of the ppl that know whats going on, but its not enough to change anything. ...so we need to accept it, even if its hard :(

               Thank you.  I will start with The Cult That Hijacked The World.  I have an Irish friend that married a Jewish man and I know she will read it, he likes to read too, so I am hoping to red pill them even further than I already have.  They are the only ones that have listened.  The joke is, that I thought they would be the last ones.  Proves that you never know, leave no stone un-turned.

                Of the hundreds of books that I have read over my 43 years of life, this one is the best if you want to make an expert out of a novice. This single book can save a beginner 10 years of reading - trial &amp; error. Let's red pill as many as possible. Pizzagate is the global currency that the psychopaths use to fund their agenda. Next 4 years with Trump is our best chance. Let's not waste it on Kardashians and American Idol (all scripted!) while our children are being tortured and killed by Skippy and that psycho Ping Pong guy as we speak.
