<p>The framers of the Constitution intended that the Electoral College guard against the possibility that a foreign power influences the outcome of a presidential election.

            I believe we're making too much over this 'russian hacking' claim.  The only thing the CIA actually said was that they think Russia was behind Wikileaks.  That is not enough to turn electors, and turning electors is the only way to stop Trump at this point.   If they could have proven that Putin actually had changed our votes, that would be a different matter.   But although Ms. Shill Stein tried to establish this, it appears to have gone nowhere.  I think the desperation at this point is all about discrediting Wikileaks, because they know the election is lost - it is now all about avoiding prosecution of the pedophile ring and the Clinton Foundation.
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             The Post reported late Friday that the CIA had concluded that individuals with close ties to the Russian government delivered thousands of hacked emails from the Democratic National Committee, including from Hillary Clinton’s campaign chairman, to WikiLeaks a few weeks before the election. Intelligence officials have determined that Russia’s goal was to help Trump win, rather than simply undermine confidence in the election.

            Summary
           </p>
           <p>
            Obama and co. are setting up a narrative that Russians hacked the election. They will declare the election results are illegitimate, and overthrow him or worse. Look what has happened so far;
           </p>
           <ul>
            <li>
             Anti-Trump protests covered by MSM (which were only in areas where Clinton won, while Trump cleaned up everywhere else)
            </li>
            <li>
             Allegations of Russians hacking. eg. Trying to tie Guccifer with Russia when he is Romanian.
            </li>
            <li>
             CIA tried to hack Georgia's electoral system after the election (to plant evidence of tampering?)
            </li>
            <li>
             Constant 'fake news' narrative to shut down dissentors
            </li>
            <li>
             Outright censorship to shut down dissentors (reddit, twitter, facebook)
            </li>
            <li>
             "Oh, but she won the popular vote" narrative
            </li>
            <li>
             Trump won by a landslide, but they never use that word.
            </li>
            <li>
             Assange said something like, "they will never let Trump win"
            </li>

            If Russia's influence disqualifies Trump, then by the same token it should disqualify Hillary, since her nomination was to the benefit of Trump.
           </p>
           <p>
            In any event, this sort of override will guarantee a civil war. That would benefit Russia more than Trump ever could.

             This is a good point, and these people know that any other outcome besides a Trump Presidency could destabilize this country.
            </p>
            <p>
             I think this is more meant to de-legitimze Trump for the future.  I don't think it will work.  That doesn't mean that Trump can't de-legitimize himself in other ways in the future, but the MSM/CIA/Obama are nearly powerless against Trump at this point, IMO.

            I'd be so pissed if I was putin.  they are just begging to start a war  - and all to cover up their sick satanic rape of children.  i don't know much about putin - i mean i know he's all alpha etc., but is he into assassins?  if he is, i wouldn't be surprised if some of these monster demon perverts "commit suicide" soon or have one car accidents.

             <p>
              was sick and tired with this ugly mega trend past ten years, since i woke up to NWO reality, it's occult satanic roots and implications into my country. to me it's a best opportunity to end this obsession and struggle, since satanic ritual abuse seems to connect all the top layer of pyramid {eye is separate and symbolizes external management}.
one of my best friends became orthodox christian just as a result of this research.
             </p>
             <p>
              sticking to the subject - ritual abuse, human sacrifices, all the dark stuff was a common pattern in many (if not all) societies way before 1776. look for what mayan's did in their temples and their symbology.
             </p>
             <p>
              and yes, jews are involved to some extent.

              </a>
              &lt;&lt;=== probably most famous case study in russian. by the creator of russian dictionary (
              <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vladimir_Dal">
               https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vladimir_Dal)
              </a>
              ) very famous and credible guy (1801–1872).
             </p>
             <p>
              i'm sure there's a similar cases in every country (well documented and proven by credible sources) forming a common pattern.
that's how blood libel (
              <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_libel">
               https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_libel)
              </a>
              ) came about.
that's why many (also innocent) jewish people had to migrate - masses can tolerate lot of things, but not blood sucking of children.
             </p>
             <p>
              i'd speculate that most jews has nothing to do with all the dark stuff. BUT there is a pattern.

            Honestly, I would've expected more outrage from my government / politicians (from both parties) regarding the supposed "conclu[sion] that Russia intervened in the 2016 election...."  As a person of government, I'd be perturbed about my country and its dysfunctional democratic system!

            Time to update and restock my canned food supply. I have about 1 months worth currently, but it wouldn't hurt to have a few more boxes. Maybe 3 to 4 months worth of food. The great thing about tinned food is that its super cheap and you can fill a few boxes for a hundred bucks and store them anywhere.

            BTW, if anyone can get to the NYPD in Forest Hills, NY 112 PCT, that is Weiner's precinct (fact). They must know what was on his laptop. NYPD is not stupid. I believe they probably copied the drive &amp; may have contacted Trump directly with the info. Maybe he's just waiting till 1/20 when he can do something about it.

            A few thoughts...
           </p>
           <p>
            Luckily Trump can bypass the MSM by tweeting to give credibility that pizzagate is real. That is serious leverage.
           </p>
           <p>
            Also, it's not like the citizens of this country trust the CIA (same guys that said we have to invade Iraq).  They are about as trusted as the MSM. And this isn't a new narrative. They tried the blame Russia thing during the election and obviously it didn't work. People aren't stupid, they already know Trump and Putin are friendly.
           </p>
           <p>
            Lastly, Obama is old news. He's about to be humbled to the reality of being a lame duck. Trump won in part because of Obama's arrogance. We're tired of being lectured by this narcissist.
           </p>
           <p>
            Watch gold and stocks for signs that there is traction to this coup. If it looks like there is a chance that they will push hard on this, gold should ramp up quickly and stocks will get crushed for fear of civil unrest.

               The one thing here is.....Trump talks directly to the people via social networks, if they ban him from these social netwoks, they already have the MSM in their pockets then he would have no way of talking to the people.

             Watch that be the day Twitter kicks him off for some reason. He should get a secondary acct on Gab - and leave Twitter himself.

              Could happen, but that would not go over well.  Trump is bigger than twitter anyway.  If he wants to get his message out, he can.

            Fuck. I was just watching these sick fucks on CNN the other day coming on as electors against Trump. They kept on spewing this exact redirect, that this process was blah blah blah muh russians hacker just like you say. I am honestly getting worried about the fact that they may frame this and take away the election from Trump.

            The accusations towards Russia are going to go very badly.  So badly nobody will care about pizzagate by comparison.  Release of falsified intelligence that "proves" Russia did interfere, claim the election is invalid.  Release of more damning "evidence" that will call for military action.  Obama looks like the hero because he and Clinton were right about the Russians.  Obama passes the torch to Clinton.  Done.
           </p>
           <p>
            I completely believe Putin does not want war.  I do however believe Putin WILL defend Russia with everything he has.  We are all in a a precarious position.  Let's hope the military tells Obama to fuck off.  Of course, mercenaries kill for money and our elected officials know how to launder money and covertly transport weapons.
           </p>
           <p>
            All I know is something stinks very badly about all this.  Something big is happening and it's either going to be a huge deception or the truth coming out to stop it.

            Any guesses when shit will hit the fan?  Christmas?  That's my guess.

           <p>
            EDIT('cause I'm way too thinky right now):  Have we been seeing some leftover KGB tacticts from the Cold War.  The Communists are so close to getting back at Russia since the fall of the Soviet Union.  The has been a long-term overthrow.  Communist KGB has had enough time to infiltrate the CIA and start turning people with the pedo blackmail.  If the public found out about it....holy shite mang.  War with Russia would erase it.
           </p>
           <p>
            OH, check out:
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Protocols_of_the_Elders_of_Zion">
             The Protocols of the Elders Zion
            </a>
            and think about how that relates to Jesuits and the CIA vs KGB/Russia.

             I agree. We all breathed a sigh of relief including Putin when Trump won. We certainly avoided ww3 for the time being. But. if they pull off a coup and crown that hag, I think Putin may have to do a preemptive. I know I would. You know exactly what's coming.

            i just got back from checking out the FB consensus on this story in a variety of links. People are fucked in the head, that's all i gotta say about that. Waiting for some libtard responses to some of my posts. They say, "trumpeters don't care about that facts" with 800 likes. Meanwhile these air head fucknuts are like moths to a street lamp gobbling up the "facts' surrounding this. There are no facts. Just bullshit.

             I wonder why no one has brought up the Hillary/terrorist connections?  Hillary has taken money from countries that are tied to 9/11 and terrorism.  They are the immediate threat not Russia.  Check out Washington Post :

            Agree on this - and really like Greenwald's position on it:
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             The key claims are based
             <strong>
              exclusively on the unverified assertions
             </strong>
             of
             <strong>
              anonymous officials
              <strong>
               , who in turn are disseminating their own claims about what the
              </strong>
              CIA purportedly believes
             </strong>
             , all based on evidence that remains
             <strong>
              completely secret
             </strong>
             .

            do you guys realize that we witnessed something absolutely out of this world ? and its only a small hand ful off people who know this is all about pizzagate ! all the other people believe in the narratives put out by the msm and gatekeepers.
           </p>
           <p>
            the only chance is creating mass awareness , the evidences are already so brutal and slamming , but we need to win the fight against the deletion of sites , they have aslso begun to delete archives !
           </p>
           <p>
            its also that we are somehow blessed with illumination , if their coup works out we are probably all the first to be hunted down by cia , so lets try to turn that around as good as possible ... its like a holy mission is put into the hands of the people here, against the darkest and most sinister of all creation , if not the society of our grand grand children will all be chipped and genetically downgraded and treated like mkultraslaves , can you imagine that hell ?

            If you look at the headlines in the last 24 hours, you can see a HUGE concerted "Russia influenced the election" effort.  First they tried to deny him electoral votes due to three ridiculous recounts.  Soros is also funding an effort to get "faithless electors" to defect.
           </p>
           <p>
            Now, part 3 is this Russia garbage.  Ex-CIA spook Robert Baer was on CNN floating the idea that a new vote may be necessary due to Russian influence.
           </p>
           <p>
            I haven't heard too much out of the MSM about all the foreign money that flowed to the Clintons in the past 8 years in an effort to influence our politics.
           </p>
           <p>
            I think you're seeing the reason why Trump is going so heavy on Military Generals, just in case there is funny business.

              I don't see there being 35+ electors willing to take $$$ in exchange for what could result in a civil war.  The Republicans know that they would have lost the Senate without Trump, and there were a lot of former Dems that switched to Trump.  If they screw those people over, the R's are done for good.
             </p>
             <p>
              If the electors flip, there will be bloodshed.

              I'm not American, but even looking in from the outside, I know there would be a civil war if Trump isn't allowed to take his place in the white house.  He won fair and square....Hillary had nothing and I mean NOTHING to offer the American people.

              Sadly other countries have been brainwashed by the media portraying Trump as an Idiot, a clown, a warmonger.......We're the ones who've been set free and we will stand up for what's right.

              They can be paid off. Many have already been threatened. One elector from Texas said he won't vote for Trump even tho millions of people voted for him. So, in other words, screw what the people want. HE will vote for who he chooses

            Not to mention the FACT that in Obama's last speech to the "troops"  he basically told them to overthrown Trump. However..the troops hate Obama, 98% of the military voted for Trump. The CIA is going to be on the losing end of this one.Trump is the legally elected president of the U.S. anything else that happens is going to be very very ugly.

             There was an article over a year ago saying only 13 percent of the Military support Obama. Bet that hasn't changed or went even lower.

              From what I've gathered reading around, that number is about right. Trump was expected to get about 98% of military due to his historic support of active duty and his calling out the VA system. Which sucks. If people knew how bad that was they'd probably never (or shouldn't) join up. They love you just fine as cannon fodder, then once you're wounded...its' GTFO.

               Pretty much most of my family on both sides was military.
Have an Uncle who gets screwed around a lot for his meds was in a helicopter accident. He voted Trump but was really unsure at the same time but he said 
"If Hillary gets it BYE America" He didn't like voting for a reality show rich guy but any thing has to be better than another democrat, especially a Clinton.

                if that's all he knew about Trump, he didn't do his homework...but that's about 99% of everyone. But he was right, war with Russia was a certainty. Obama is still trying to engineer Assad's overthrow. How many more days that asswipe gonna be in office?

                  Heh, redpilled eh? Excellent. I was worried when I saw the Rex Tillerson media rage, then I went and listened to a few of his Q&amp;As and speeches...then I knew why Trump picked him. The man has some massive integrity.

                  FUCK yeah I can't wait to see the back of Obama. I admit to voting for him ONCE (I had to vote for Where's "leppo in 2012 cause..McCain/Obama..oh hell no). I voted for hope and change..got short changed...and wow did he get worse and worse...fucker...a world wide celebration is going to be happening the day that man walks out never to return.

                   I voted for him too.
I spent a lot of time apologizing to my conservative friends. He lied to us and he couldn't of won with out the white vote and he took our votes and said fuck you racists . I think the reason why the media won't report whites getting mobbed or worse is because of revenge.

                   Pay back and that's wrong. In five years from now if skins roam the streets liberals are to blame.  Obama was a pay back,revenge presidency, wish I was smarter but my conservative pal told me" Your one vote wouldn't of changed anything"
My Uncle said that Obama has changed a lot of people. They are more patriotic, less liberal.

                   Listened to Laura Ingrahm today Byron York was on, said the Dems are not going to be able to do shit, and get over it he won.
They didn't seem worried. A lot are though as liberals will result to the lowest of the low. Won't relax till Trump and staff are in that house after the New Year.

              i read somewhere - some ex fbi article -  that hillary called daddy bush (ghwbush) to have the cia rig 5 states for her because she knew the real polls had trump ahead.  they said that the rigging was underway but that some organization on the west coast shut it down - something about a university.  maybe they said the east coast shut down something on the west coast.  i can't remember

                and there were machines that lit up 'hillary' even when you pressed the button for trump - i saw video of it on youtube, someone took their phone camera into the polling booth, that was in Texas but there were claims of it in another couple of states

               It wasn't Hitler or the Nazi's, they were against this! Thats why they were attacked from all sides. This is Bolshevik communism! The Bolsheviks pre-invasion plan was exactly the same in all western nations, liberalize and then attack the weakened nations, the US was already infiltrated and Roosevelt was a communist, his VP was a full blown proud and open communist.
              </p>
              <p>
               The Bolshevik plan was to invade Europe by the middle of the century with the help of the USA but the rise of Hitler screwed everything up for them so they moved their plan ahead, but then Hitler attacked Poland because of the attacks on Germans in what was former German territory. They were being beaten, raped, tortured and murdered. Hitler had to react! But Hitler didn't know of the Bolshevik conspiracy as well as he thought he did. In the end, the Bolsheviks came up with the lies about the gas chambers and the US helped fabricate the story.
              </p>
              <p>
               Disarmament of the UK civilians was well underway like the US, but the US civilians have been stubborn and persistent and keeping the constitution making them the most difficult to disarm and are thus, the most formidable nation.
              </p>
              <p>
               But now that the constitution is all but burnt, and Americans have been brainwashed so thoroughly, it wont be very long before the war starts taking a higher death toll.

                 This isn't denying, this is revision. If you research with an open mind and sort through the chaff you'll realise that we weren't told the complete truth. For one, the German jewish Zionists knew exactly what was happening to there fellowmen. They fled the country. They knew where it was heading. George Soros actually admitted as much. I can't link it at the moment but please look up the 60 minutes Soros interview on YouTube just for an introduction on things we aren't told.

                 Why don't you ask the German courts why they handed down life sentences to Jewish Holocaust deniers and not others.
                </p>
                <p>
                 Recently a former Nazi was sentenced to 18 months, he had been sentenced about 30 times before over the last 50/60 years. Another old lady was also sentenced recently for the same. But the Jews who denied it, where sentenced once decades ago and nobody ever hears about them.
                </p>
                <p>
                 And it shouldn't be against the law to question something if it is true!

            i have been saying this in my head since the beginning, if they really wanted to incite social hysteria, this would certainly work better than their past attempts at division via racial tensions, or lgbt divisions, or other tactics.

              But nothing will divide them quicker than one person buying the pizzagate evidence and someone they previously respected just dismissing it with a careless Westworld-ish "Doesn't look like anything to me" because the MSM is still feeding their ego.

               whaa?   westworld? what is that? Whos ego is feed by MSM? CIA is claiming Russia hacked the server, but whose fault is that? Who is stupid enough to use an unsecured server in a residential home for classified information or even yoga emails. Anyone that careless deserved to be hacked and lose an election for the content of their creepy campaign manager's email. Why doesn't the MSM remember that!

            I agree with this assessment, entirely. The CIA is moving quickly to undermine Trump and deny him the Presidency.  Over the next 40 days, things are going to be extremely dodgy.  Everyone needs to be aware why this is happening.

            It's happening because of Pizzagate.

              My whole family hunts..no matter what people gotta eat. My ancestors traded, it benefits those who are good, and who can benefit me, hopefully they're smart like you and hook me up. I'm poor, but I'm prepped in the freezer. I'd rather help folk who'll need it in the event of the world goin to hell in a handbasket. I'm afraid they're feeling caged, and they're going to do something to start with Russia in Syria, why we need to send troops there but to use as a warning to us. Most sane people want to befriend Russia, not war. We are tired of war, and those that profit off of the conflict of war in monetary and personal ways. I hope Russia realizes that we don't want enemies, we have enough. Russia should be our friend.

              Bitcoin is on the rise in value.  They are pulling large bills out of circulation in 5 countries, as we speak. I believe the market is being falsely inflated right now by large investors and massive short selling will begin after the new year.

                  Just like Pizzagate- you have to do some research and come up with answers. I might be a good time - I really don't know. Gold and Silver are pretty solid though too - and you can't put a Bitcoin in your hand. More easily accessible though.

             Guys, calm down for a second and think about this rationally. If the CIA wanted to block trump's presidency, they would have done it from the get-go. They wouldn't have even risked "Election Results" in the first place. The hillary email investigation has been going on for quite some time (Since 2015). They would have known what all would have come out along with that. Here's my personal theory on what's going down: They're cleaning house, and minimizing damage and impact. If they were to deny trump the presidency this late in the game, they know damn well there would be revolution/civil war. Here's the thing about civil war against the american people. We the people would win 100% of the time. The red-team planner papers are a very good description of why this would work out as such:

             IMHO what we're seeing right now is the result of fracturing within the ranks. Someone, somewhere has dishonored the policy of "You watch our back, we'll watch yours" and now they've fragmented. This is by NO means a way to encourage ANYONE to stop investigating, but I think we're seeing bug-out tactics at this point. The media is pushing the fakenews agenda hard, while they are trying to instill doubt in the populous with this Russian-Hacker crap. I think this has less to do with blocking trump, and more to do with softening the blow WHEN (not if) pizzagate is brought to light as being 100% true. What I think they're doing is trying to distance themselves, or set themselves up as poor victims of rumors or russian hackers, while lower-level officials take the fall for the more heinous stuff that cannot be ignored. All while the upper level officials were "Completely unaware" of what was going on, and any evidence found on them was merely "Planted by Russian hackers." That's just my humble opinion of course, but the CIA isn't stupid. These seem more like risk-management tactics.

              First of all, nobody within the Beltway thought Trump had a chance of winning the election.  The CIA could have very well been caught flat footed and I suspect, being they are in the bag for the Clintons, they were very happy with the selection of Trump when they could not get their preferred candidate, Jeb Bush. The release of the Podesta emails was the REAL October surprise. They do indeed implicate the Podestas and with John's right hand status in the Clinton campaign, the dots to the Clinton Foundation and child trafficking are easy to connect. The CIA could have been content with riding out the first four years of a Trump Presidency, but all bets are now off.  They feel threatened by both PG and the incoming Trump administration. I am certain there are massive levels of fracturing going on behind the scenes in both the FBI and the CIA.  I think there is good and bad people in both, but the last thing there is right now is CONTINUITY.  It would be a mistake to assume that everything is hunky dory and I would suggest a greater level of attention is paid to what is going on in the halls of power at this point, rather than rummaging through the dumpster behind COMET ping pong or scouring Instagram, searching for smoking guns.

              Good points, but a couple of things to remember:
             </p>
             <p>
              First, something clearly went wrong with the election. The polls and commentary from the media were that Hillary would win easily. On election night, the networks were refusing to call key states for Trump in hopes of keeping the game going, and were desperate to somehow eek out a Clinton victory. I think the fix was in for Hillary but something went terribly wrong.
             </p>
             <p>
              Second, the Clintons are psycopaths. I believe they've launched a number of different operations to try and stop Trump's presidency, because they know if they can't stop him they're going down hard. The Jill Stein recounting is an attempt to disrupt the electoral college process, and now the Russian tampering story is being put out there.
             </p>
             <p>
              I think the Clinton's are dead serious about this. They don't need the CIA to block trump; they just need elements from within it that are loyal to issue a statement, which they did. Now it's in Obama's hands. If they can have Senate hearings and launch a media campaign then they'll make it look like Obama is saving democracy from the Russians. Any resistance from within the political or military structure will look like treason. They'll need to keep control of crucial people within the power structure, and the whole thing will play out as a political controversy.
             </p>
             <p>
              With what's at stake here...I'm certain that Hillary will go all in. She won't risk a defeat here. If she does lose, she'll kill herself.

               My only issue with that theory, is that I think action would have been taken much sooner. I believe wholeheartedly that the democrats will absolutely go down kicking and screaming. I am not disagreeing with you there. What I have an issue with is: As soon as there was a realistic possibility of trump being selected in the primaries, with the investigation into her emails already occurring, and him stating he would hire a special prosecutor, I think he would have had a "Heart Attack" or something similar. We are talking about very powerful people here. I just think this would have gotten swept under the rug a lot sooner, rather than risking an actual election against him in the first place.

              But they want us to start a civil war. That's why Soros funded Black Lives Matter. They pushed for this race war and anger at the police. If people are rioting and civil war breaks out then the government can call for martial law. Then Obama can do whatever he wants and push for the inauguration for Trump to not be held until everything settles down. That's how Obama could work it so Trump can't mess up all of their plans.
             </p>
             <p>
              Or, a MAJOR FALSE FLAG attack could happen to keep Obama in office. I do not feel like this handing over of power will go smoothly. They have far too much invested and I don't think they will just hand all of that power to Trump who plans on changing everything without a fight and they are ruthless. I think something bad is going to happen. I pray it all works out. But, Obama, Hillary, Soros and all of the others are corrupt and dangerous. What do they have to lose?

               Yeah but they know they'll lose. There's no scenario that plays out that ensures the government would win in a situation like that. The other issue is: A civil war would cost them billions of dollars in both the stock market and infrastructure investments. I think if anything, your second theory is more likely to happen. A false-flag attack prevents there from being a civil war/revolution, while attempting to maintain control. I do agree the democrats are going to go down kicking and screaming, 100%. I just don't think they'll bring it to civil war levels JUST yet. I think that will be reserved as scorched earth tactics, for when they are 100% fractuired/never coming back.

                The reason I mention the government and civil war is, that Soros is donating a lot of money to Black lives matter and other controversial matters. I read somewhere that they want to have everyone fighting, have racism and people against police. That will cause civil unrest and give them more power. That plan didn't work. It's died down. I've read that if Trump does make it into office, there is a plan for a big stock market crash. That way we will blame Trump for the economy. It just never ends with these people. Maybe "civil war" was a bad choice of words.

                 That does make perfect sense. If you read the Red Team Planner link I had posted, keep in mind: They'd be willing to start WWIII, rather than a civil war. WWIII still gives them a chance to maintain power and a "Common Enemy" to distract people with. Civil/revolution means an immediate loss of power. An economic collapse is definitely not outside the realm of reality. I definitely don't think it unrealistic that a false flag or economic collapse will happen. In fact I guarantee it will. They will try everything within their power to de-legitimize trump and make him look bad, but I think they're also going to do it from the side-lines for the next 4 years. I think this is a retreat and re-group tactic that we need to be VERY cautious of.

                  I think if Hillary won that we would definitely have World War 3. What I don't get tho, is how would that be good for them if the whole country is destroyed? I've always wondered why Obama and Hillary seem war happy. I mean, their lives would be affected too. It wouldn't be very fun living in underground bunkers. Wouldn't it make more sense to these people to NOT go to war?

              how half of the country cannot see through this amazes me!  hillary lost, so pizzagate is NOT an attempt to smear Hillary and as if Russia gives a hoot about smearing the left.  it's just so ridiculous.  there's no sinister motive here.  russia is not involved in putting porn on their computers and we have to reason to falsely accuse anyone.  they already lost.  and there are republicans in this pedo ring too.  i just can't understand why half the nation refuses to believe it.
             </p>
             <p>
              oh and what's the deal with hillary and bill and the left with their purple?  they conceded in purple and many left media wore purple after the election.

Thank you for your calm head.

             <p>
              Now at the inauguration every one should be on the look out for paid thugs to even start violence.
Trump is getting his panel together and Repubs have control here any one think they are going to allow this ? Even the ones that dogged him during the election?
They are in control again, think they will willingly give that up?
             </p>
             <p>
              With all the shit done to our police force any one think all of them will bow down to Dems ?
Remember NYPD turning their backs on De Blasio?
             </p>
             <p>
              Military? No way. 
Reflect on the Chatanooga terroist attack and the Navy man who killed the scum . Some one decided to bring charges against him for carrying when the area didn't allow it. Vets, and military wrote the Sec of Defense and said " you better not or else"
             </p>
             <p>
              Eventually " Um nah, we won't charge him" only within weeks after the FBI put out a warning of middle eastern men going to military base threatening military families.
             </p>
             <p>
              Think they are going to allow another democrat liberal to steal the election after the way Obama treated them and after Benghazi with Hillary?
             </p>
             <p>
              The disgust with liberals goes high up, it's not just us assholes on Voat. It's not just Voat.
             </p>
             <p>
              After Jill Stein and her dumb ass stealing money any one think they can just steal the election?
That's taking their civil war liberals already started,and having all of those armed "crazy" citizens they are soooooo scared of  say " fuck it " and boom!!!
             </p>
             <p>
              Might even have some pissed off liberals who jumped the democrat boat join in because of what they did to Sanders and if any one reads on Hillary, her back ground, history, she's not well liked by those that work with her.
             </p>
             <p>
              YouTube has some fantastic documentaries about her. When Billy first won the White  House, staff, even FBI was not allowed to look her in the eyes, or say good morning, or hello.
             </p>
             <p>
              This is all CYA over the shit found in Podestas emails, what they did to Sanders, especially.
             </p>
             <p>
              I'm willing to bet though Trump would of still won with out these emails. People already had enough, riots, liberal SJW over reach. Refugees, it's not Islamic terror attitudes, and being called racist all the time. Good God, there's SO much as to why Trump won and why no way in hell democrats are going to steal the election back to fucking Hillary.
             </p>
             <p>
              They can't just up and take over, like the electoral vote. Now they could take this to a court of law if they wanted . Trey Gowdy would be there waiting for them, they don't want that lol.
             </p>
             <p>
              People need to calm down. Trump is President Elect soon to be President Trump. Nothing will change that not BLM, college professors who teach gender studies, or students who think you can threaten people and change the constitution, HollyWood, any of these commie fucks who should LEAVE if they hate this country so much.
             </p>
             <p>
              They can TRY, if they go too far, all of those gun toting conservatives MSNBC tried to scare every one about, will make front page news.

               Absolutely. I agree with you 100%. We need to be on the lookout for rouge rabble-rousers and saboteurs, but stealing the election this late in the game is just 100%  suicide. Even they know it. Neither the military or police forces would back a stolen government. We need to keep investigating Pizzagate, and make sure any accusations aren't covered up, or the evidence is so damning that they can't use "Muh russian hackers" as an excuse.

               The CIA is pedophilia and blackmail. The CIA runs this nation. It's not Clinton and the Liberals that threaten Trump, it's the CIA.  You have been completely programmed by the Media of this nation and are parroting the lines, perfectly. Oh, the CIA runs the Media, too.

               They weren't allowed to look her in the eye because that is the window to one's soul. I'm quite keen to it and the way she looks one way, that crazed smile but the eyes are angry. Her eyes are very foretelling. Many nutjobs are, that's why I make eye contact with people when I greet them. I'm kind to be kind, I've seen light. But it serves me to know who's not kind back. HilPickles woulda been found out ages ago had they looked her in her eyes daily.

                When Dennis Miller did the news on SNL he was talking about Bill Clinton (forget exactly what it was) Bill was trying to do something, and Dennis was all "There's just one problem". Screen goes to a picture of Bill at a podium out side talking and zooms in on Hillary standing behind him applauding him but with this cold steely stare. It was creepy but she looked like she was applauding the fact she had power.

               <p>
                Creepy. Good sketch by Dennis wish I could find that picture.
Before I knew much about her I never liked her that picture sealed that deal.

                 I think good writers slip one past "Them" sometimes, they don't realize they're the joke. So many weird deaths from that show. My favorite Chris Farley. Phil Hartman too, there's so many. Some end up just fading away into obscurity. They know things but know they'd die mysteriously if they say anything. I understand wanting to save one's own hide.But,  I hope more victims do come forward, and there will be a witness protection one can trust in. For now you just notice some of their cues. Thank heavens some will drop a lil bomb hidden in jokes. George Carlin had a great grasp on things back in the 80's videos, earlier probably. And, we laugh but it's true, he warned us. And he didn't wanna know what their secret clubs were all about, wanted no part of it. I think those that paid with their life for any truth exposed, or from the perverts paranoia that they might divulge if they aren't indulging themselves. They disappear or die.

              Good summary, I would add that there are factions not just within govt but also with in the CIA itself. Remember good people join the ranks of these alphabet agencies because they grow up wanting to be a part of the "good guys". People on the inside know plenty well about the evil shit that consists of the CF and wanted to see the witch lose.  The chance to stop trump was in springtime, he is and will be our next pres unless they want to risk civil war. These are the dying gasps of the real fake news.

               The other guy is correct. Organized crime, and even governments (China is a good example) will sacrifice their lower officials to protect the upper ranks. Plenty of politicians in China get the death penalty for corruption and embezzlement, but only the lower local-level officials. You NEVER see that within the upper ranks. It makes the population think that justice is served, even in the government, but it's all an act. That's why we need to focus and keep investigating to ensure whatever upper level officials are implicated, stay implicated, and cannot write off any evidence found as "Russian Hacking" or manipulation.

              The CIA didn't plan on Bernie Sanders though. Sanders completely exposed the democrats as criminals and it shattered the party. She lost so many bernie votes that they couldn't recover. By the time they realized she would lose, Trump was too far ahead to do anything about it. They don't have a problem with killing him, but I think that is a last resort. This si all just my speculation.

               Agreed. I think at this point the best tactic would be for them to use what skills and information they have to mitigate damage, and partition it from the top officials as much as possible, and maybe even sacrifice one or two, so the people feel "Justice was served" while retaining control of any investigation that does occur under trump. Keeping him alive serves their interests in that: It will subdue the ones who would otherwise take action themselves, had trump not begin investigating. Of course your truly powerful players will have just been victims of Russian hacking, or never even found it due to planted evidence our false trails leading to minor or insignificant people.

              C.I.A. = Catholics In Action. Washington D.C. is a Jesuit (Black Pope) stronghold. The CIA didn't write the book on pedophile blackmail/overthrow of gov'ts/black markets - The Jesuits did. They've been at it since Sept. 27, 1540 when Ignatious of Loyola founded it. They are the Black Soldiers of the Hidden Pope. They may call themselves the Society of Jesus, but I don't think they care for Him much.

                  You can break it down into a characterization of people who have a public persona which is radically different to their private persona. When you apply it to religion you could get the Donmeh or your could get hyprocites, it doesn't matter what the religion is that their public persona has.

             There's more at risk than what comes from pizzagate.  If you haven't noticed in all of your digging that trump is throwing the largest populist monkey wrench into the nwo works of all time.  Hillary was to be their capstone on the project to bring north america into a singular government.  EU and NA would be open trading partners and they'd have free movement and control over two continent.

              Pizzagate goes deep, but it goes far deeper. Perhaps the complete loss of credibility on the global stage or flat out collapse from within.

              The systematic pedo/blackmail ring that has been uncovered in the Podesta emails goes into all corners of the government, including the CIA. The CIA grew up on this method of corrupting agents, officials and politicians.  THEY OWN THE EXISTING GOVERNMENT.  Pizzagate is the thread that is being pulled and unraveling everything.

               CIA MKULTRA-Monach continues to appear in background as model for torture and sexual abuse for Mind Control.  (Records of Monarch were ordered destroyed by former Dir. of CIA, Richard Helms.)
Pedophiles elevated to high office in government may be their most reliable (blackmail-able) assets.
CIA seemed to have gained the Oval Office at least by the time of Reagan/Bush, where it is said that Bush became president after the attack on Reagan.  The Polish Pope also looked like CIA.  Vatican involvement in child abuse also cannot be overlooked -- and they are also frequently mentioned .... especially Australia, Belgium.
