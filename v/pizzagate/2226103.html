             <p>
              bit of a long story.mainly because it's connected to many other things happening now .
             </p>
             <p>
              hariri,awan,ISIS. upcoming DNC arrests in the US,even 9/11.
             </p>
             <p>
              It's the old guard being cleaned up ,but that doesn't mean the internal situation is under control in SA.
             </p>
             <p>
              it might be a set-up for SA. they are in deep doodoo anyway ,because of the things the old guard was involved in.
             </p>
             <p>
              many developments right now don't happen by coincidence,especially if it comes to timing.
             </p>
             <p>
              Keep an eye on MERS CoV ,even that might play a role soon as well.
             </p>
             <p>
              it looks like desperation ,because the House of Saud is an artifcial entity ,and the plug can be pulled anytime by their creators ,in London.
             </p>
             <p>
              developments in the ME and the US the coming days will determine the outcome of this action.but it could blow up in their faces as well.
             </p>
             <p>
              they have too many enemies,and their 'friends ' in the US and London are under enormous pressure.
             </p>
             <p>
              my guess is the young warmongerer crown prince has been tricked ,based on his vanity and megalomania,into self destruction,and that's a good thing.

              <p>
               Do you mean Middle East Respiratory Syndrome/just looked up MERS CoV and that is what came up.  Inferring what?  An epidemic in SA?
              </p>
              <p>
               K, yes I know House of Saud is artificial but how might it blow up in their faces?
              </p>
              <p>
               Who is putting the pressure on their 'friends' in the US and London?
              </p>
              <p>
               Who would trick the young crown prince?  He is a real piece of work.
              </p>
              <p>
               To my understanding SA and Israel are best buddies~9/11 was a combined effort of SA, Israel and US.
              </p>
              <p>
               I've not seen this much activity on so many fronts in can't really say when/ever even?  What it 'looks like' is lots of power centers are duking it out.  Possibly the cia is 'hopefully' being called to the carpet.  That could at least stop the rampant destabilization of other countries...hope springs eternal.
              </p>
              <p>
               Then of course the fbi troubles here/LA ff is simply not going away/nor the calif fires.  I have wondered if in this power struggle the clinton machine is in cahoots with SA and fbi for the LV thing.  Whatever happened it was a coordinated effort.  And of course the doa's after the fact from the event has a classic clinton footprint.  It would seem like, if that is the case, the clinton machine was trying to destabilize the trump machine.  Not a fan of trump but far as I can tell he is not into sra.
               <br/>
               Everything that is happening all at once looks like an attempt to bring the present machine in power down/but how would I know?
              </p>
              <p>
               The fires...who do you think is behind that?
              </p>
              <p>
               I know that HC has connections in just about every arm of the gov/her loyalist.  LV I think had some military elements as well.  Do you have any speculations on what part of the military she is connected to/sure/the part that is into human trafficking but which part?  The military would also have those that are patriotic/so internal struggle there.
              </p>
              <p>
               Speculation again but I think the bollywood explosion was perhaps intended as a distraction but has taken on a life of it's own.  Since the cia controls bolly and cia is clinton territory this would fit.  It 'looks like' many desperate attempts to regain control of the narrative which does not 'seem like' it is working.
              </p>
              <p>
               And now supposedly trump is once again pissed at sessions for not doing something about clinton.  Sessions is such a sniveling wit who would rather go after weed smokers than really do anything justice wise.  Well, that is being challenged in federal court/again good news.  No medical value, seriously sessions?  How about you tell that to VA docs?  And of course the lumber industry that stands to lose big time when hemp replaces a lot of that industry.
              </p>
              <p>
               Just lots of things whirling around in my noggin...and I appreciate your insight.  Not that I think trump will usher in a new age of sanity but he is enough of a narcissist that he doesn't want his legacy to be one of ridicule and failure.  First we have to stop sra/the biggest issue/then ppl can work up from there.  The systems as we know it have to fold so something new can be built.  It will swing from the anything goes to ultra conservative but there is the prospect for improvement if the masses can figure out how to come to a point of balance.
              </p>
              <p>

                the old guard in SA and Israel were  controlled by the same forces,and that's changing now.
               </p>

                SRA IS the system itself,no way to get up high if you can't be Brownstoned.

               <p>
                Frontstage backstage= what do you say and show to the public,and what are you really doing behind the scenes.
               </p>
               <p>
                so have some patience with Sessions,Russia and others,because what they say is frontstage,what they  do in reality,facts on the ground, is backstage.
               </p>
               <p>
                not saying these peeps are "good",but they have common enemies.
               </p>
               <p>
                Yes ,the virusses are a thing to watch.
               </p>
               <p>
                once they release a virulent strain ,panic will cause fear,and fear will prepare people to be vaccinated,even if the virus itself doesn't kill more than 1% of infected.
               </p>
               <p>
                once the vaccines come,there's no way of knowing what's in them,and anybody refusing is in trouble.
               </p>
               <p>
                so watch out for the vaccine,it's much worse than any virus(bioweapon) they will release..
               </p>
               <p>
                the SA crownprince is the one who decided to attack yemen,and that makes him extremely impopular in the ME,too many dead and a country destroyed.
               </p>
               <p>
                this could blow up in his face ,because he's putting his trust in Trump.to have his back,so he's a hostage now,and there might be forces in SA that don't like that.
               </p>

                house of saud is tribe,so arresting part of your family,will cause some backlash internally.
               </p>
               <p>
                Silence from Israel on developments in SA is deafening,so this might be a development that even Israel didn't really see coming,or wasn't really prepared for.

                just focus on facts on the ground,ignore the spin and blabla,that's mostly just mindfocks

                 I've not had a problem with Russia.  Putin is no angel but one thing is clear (at least to me) he is for Russia/not like clinton who will sell to the highest bidder/or bama for that matter.
                </p>
                <p>
                 Sessions/will have to wait on that one...so far not seen anything to impress but there may be more backstage as you indicate.  Why would he seem so ineffective, like busy chasing weed/a ruse while clinton company is being lined up?
                </p>
                <p>
                 Vacs...don't have to tell me.  I know what is going on with them/have for a long long time.  Fortunately I'm from the era where only a few were given and when kids at least had a chance to develope some immune system.  Course after the polio vac they removed my tonsils few years later bc of chronic chest things.  Still nothing like what is happening today.  Friend is an instructor for among other things emt.  He is very well known, travels in the higher circles/knows top peditricans in the country.  We were discussing vacs recently and I said the vacs (contaminants in them) causing autism etc.  He said not try, these top docs have looked into it/not all docs are brain dead and vessels of big pharma.  At this point I'm thinking 'I know' and he is deluded.  Then he looks at me and says something very chilling/mind you he is more conservative in some of his opinions that moi/no, what is happening in the vacs is much more sinister and the docs cannot figure out what it is/but it is being done on purpose.  So I thought about it and sure, the focus on the ingredients in the vacs could be a diversion.  Some plum island brainchild that can't be seen.  This apparently is the conclusion of the top docs/something that is not seen bc they have looked at all the ingredients and cannot isolate what is causing the rapid decline of the children.

                  </p>
                  <p>
                   While the focus is on shootings, bollywood and let's not forget, focus on racine...the US is gearing up for war with Iran.  Of course the overthrow of Iran will not happen bc russia and others are not going to permit it/they have too much to lose (including russia also on the chopping block).

                   HC is being tossed under the bus bc the dems are trying to reorganize the party.  She was supposed to stfu and she just won't quit...so conveniently Donna's book comes out exposing all.  This will give those with limited vision a rallying point/off with their heads kinda thing while war drums beat.  The ff missile at SA from Yemen is blamed on Iran/SA says it considers it an act of war.

                           Actually was just asking for clarification.  Yes, two sides, one that wants satanic control, all one homogeneous and the other wants control but still preserving cultural differences etc/which to my understanding would still keep ppl controlled but more like um, mindless consumers just going along with the flow while the other one wants to remake the entire world into satanic worship.

                           Didn't realize you were talking about the testaments of the bible/if that is what you are referring to.  That helps me understand your riddle.

                           Not a bible person/ppl don't understand how the right brain works/all imagery weaving a picture but not to be taken literally.  The bible was written from a right brained culture.  I'm dyslexic (right brained) so how it works is native to me. The 'virgin' birth at the solstice has been told some 30 plus times in various cultures.  The 'christ' persona was not even one person but a compilation of 3 characters.  During Constantine council big brew ha ha as to what to include and what to axe in the final production of the bible.  Reincarnation was axed among other things.  This I learned from friends who were religious scholars some 40 years ago.  Yet when I was 8 years old learning about reincarnation thought why would they take that out of the bible/and from the uncluttered mind of a child thought oh, good way to control the ppl if they think they only have one shot at it...and making it into 'heaven'.  I was never taught to believe in hell or a vengeful god.  I was taught that 'god' is all loving always.  So it was a pretty good foundation to build on.  Later moved away from the god/persona archetype to an all encompassing energy, All That Is, and meditation.  Wrapping my head around ATI took some time but it's clear to me now.  When you start experiencing the energy, not words to describe the energy it's a whole different world.

                           Studying history is a toss of the dice bc nothing is as it seems or as it has been presented to the current day mindset.

                   Saw Sessions/Biden tube long time ago.  Sure he's against pedos but still doesn't change not only going after weed but into private prisons.  I do not trust him.  Not like the idiots with position don't have some extremely limited view of things.

                   Know about eugenics too...but what if the ingredients is a red herring and it is something else inserted into the vacs that is undetectable?  You know, the look at the right hand thing.  I'm not convinced that is the case but bc I consider all sides to any issue it did give me another angle to explore.  IE/the polio vac.  The city where I got mine as a child, 50/50 contaminated/no way to know what any one of us received.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   Perhaps the toxic ingredients are the catalyst for some unseen element.  Next time I see my friend we agreed to discuss this more.  Lot of docs researching this are doa...what if they were on the verge of discovering what that missing trigger is/maybe they were close and didn't even realize how close they were?  Didn't fully make sense to off so many if they were researching ingredients bc that has been discussed for a long time.

                   The twitter rex is interesting.  I understand now podesta's protection/various articles/the SA princes.  Sure that would dot connect.  And paying the SA's for 'donations' in children/that would fit too.  Money laundering/very convenient way to disguise child trafficking.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   According to skuttle butt, SA economy in peril (have been reading that for awhile)/how it plays out is described in the twitter.

              From what I understand Qatar outed Turkey, US and SA for the joint mission of all 4 to take over Syria.  Now that it's not happening Qatar said they did not intend to be left holding the bag.

               That happened, but before that, Qatar began becoming friendly with Iran and their media was exposing corruption in other Arab countries, pissing off the GCC members.  On Trump's first trip to KSA, pretty sure he asked for names and everyone pointed at Qatar.

               Then there were the ultimatums, etc.
              </p>
              <p>
               My gut feeling is the Saudis know Trump knows everything and were given an ultimatum to drain their own swamp or else.  There's also a theory that Kushner hand delivered evidence on those responsible for the LV shooting.

               <p>
                re LV...at this point I think some portion of our gov was responsible for LV.  It's pretty clear there are multiple factions w/in the gov that have separate agendas and it 'seems like' a power struggle going on behind the scenes.  Naturally is is speculation and subjective.

            This is related to pizzagate because the Saudis are connected to the Clintons, Podestas, and pizzagate.  Related to anon happenings.
