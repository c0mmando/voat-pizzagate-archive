“Special Litigation Counsel Andrew Kline, a Clinton appointee with an M.A. in human rights from Harvard’s Kennedy School of Government, was one of four attorneys in the Human Trafficking Prosecution Unit of the Department of Justice, in the Civil Rights Division.
It fell upon the curly-haired, bespectacled Kline (now a senior adviser in the executive office of the president) and one other colleague to provide U.S. attorneys nationwide with training on prosecuting trafficking cases.”
Besta Pizza and the coffeeshop at Politics &amp; Prose are owned by Andrew Kline. And it is that Andrew Kline – the Clinton appointee overseeing the prosecution of child sex trafficking. 
Kline’s ownership of Besta Pizza was hidden three levels deep in government data ( 1 , 2 , 3 ), so it was not easy for civilian investigators to find.
If, if one of four highest-ranking attorneys in the DoJ responsible for arresting pedophiles is himself a perpetrator, he can of course help ensure that he and his sick friends never get caught. 
It looked like a dive of a pizza pick up and delivery joint. It\'s now permanently closed no doubt due to reduced traffic.
What\'s with \'John Podesta\'s\' Google Map guide comment and the \'owners\' response. Odd or what? Shining the light again on the pedo logo of Besta Pizza &gt;&gt;  <a href="https://imgur.com/a/9WAUA">https://imgur.com/a/9WAUA</a></p>',

            Hard to wrap heads around someone so high profile and supposedly esteemed in the Washington establishment being involved in a dive of a pizza joint a few doors down from Comet Ping but hey, Nancy Pelosi's got Goat Hill Pizza happening and it's not such a flash place either. Come to think of it wonder if this Goat Pizza outlet has ever had a visit from health and safety? Layers of security and a really odd odd location.

            There are several Andrew Klines in DC area. Corporations are not human beings that you can touch or feel or serve with legal documents.  The human beings creating a corporation must designate a person to act as an agent for the corporation and that info must be public so you and I can sue the corporation.
           </p>
           <p>
            The designated agent can be the person setting up the business or his Aunt Mabel or his attorney or a professional agency whose staff is authorized to receive legal papers. (Aunt Mabel would have to be certified by law to accept service of process.).
           </p>
           <p>
            It is not unusual for  the attorney handling corporate affairs to be designated as the agent.
Being an agent for the corporation is not the same as being the owner of  the corporation.
           </p>
           <p>
            We need to do more research on Besta Pizza.

            The Andrew Kline issue was hashed out early on in PG and there are TWO Andrew Kline's in DC. Although I do believe the second Andrew Kline is a deliberate CUT OUT of the first, it has not been accurately determined that the AK in question is the Clinton appointee.

            There has been significant scrubbing and 404'ing of this topic.
