<p>Moloch is an ancient deity associated with CHILD sacrifice. Unfortunately, some attributed this statement to Hillary. It was actually written by &quot;Lew Amselem, our rep to OAS.&quot;   It was sent Aug 29  2009 and regards Honduras.  I then wondered what was going on in Honduras at that time. A quick search pulled up this, dated September 29, 2014:</p>
<p>&quot;Hard choices: Hillary Clinton admits role in Honduran coup aftermath&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;The chapter on Latin America, particularly the section on Honduras, a major source of the CHILD MIGRANTS currently POURING into the United States, has gone largely unnoticed. In letters to Clinton and her successor, John Kerry, more than 100 members of Congress have repeatedly warned about the deteriorating security situation in Honduras, especially since the 2009 MILITARY COUP that ousted the country’s democratically elected President Manuel Zelaya. As Honduran scholar Dana Frank points out in Foreign Affairs, the U.S.-backed post-coup government “rewarded coup loyalists with top ministries,” opening the door for FURTHER &quot;VIOLENCE AND ANARCHY.&quot;   Is this what triggered the flood of UNACCOMPANIED MINORS to cross our borders, many of whom &quot;disappeared?&quot; </p>
<p>It continues &quot;The homicide rate in Honduras, already the highest in the world, increased by 50 percent from 2008 to 2011; political repression, the murder of opposition political candidates, peasant organizers and LGBT activists increased and continue to this day. Femicides skyrocketed. The violence and insecurity were exacerbated by a generalized institutional collapse. Drug-related violence has worsened amid allegations of rampant corruption in Honduras’ police and government. While the gangs are responsible for much of the violence, Honduran security forces have engaged in a wave of killings and other human rights crimes with impunity.</p>
<p>Despite this, however, both under Clinton and Kerry, the State Department’s response to the violence and military and police impunity has largely been silence, along with continued U.S. aid to Honduran security forces.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;First, the confession: Clinton admits that she used the power of her office to make sure that Zelaya would not return to office. “In the subsequent days [after the coup] I spoke with my counterparts around the hemisphere, including Secretary [Patricia] Espinosa in Mexico,” Clinton writes. “We strategized on a plan to restore order in Honduras and ensure that free and fair elections could be held quickly and legitimately, which would render the question of Zelaya moot.”&quot;

<p>Now, go back and re-read the e-mail, which was written 2 months after the coup:
<a href="https://wikileaks.org/clinton-emails/emailid/14333">https://wikileaks.org/clinton-emails/emailid/14333</a></p>
<p>For optics, Obama publicly supported the return of Zelaya.
Wikipedia gives a good overview of how things played out:</p>
<p>&quot;Soon after the coup, U.S. President Barack Obama stated: &quot;We believe that the coup was not legal and that President Zelaya remains the president of Honduras, the democratically elected president there.&quot;[41] He stated: &quot;It would be a terrible precedent if we start moving backwards into the era in which we are seeing military coups as a means of political transition, rather than democratic elections.&quot;[41] Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, however, equivocated, saying that &quot;We do think that this has evolved into a coup&quot; and noting that under U.S. law, officially declaring a coup would oblige the U.S. to cut off most foreign aid to Honduras.&quot;[41][42] Cutting off aid was seen as a possibility in the days after the coup,[42] and State Department Director of Policy Planning Anne-Marie Slaughter urged Clinton to &quot;take bold action&quot; and to &quot;find that [the] coup was a \'military coup\' under U.S. law.&quot;[43] Nevertheless, Clinton did not do so, and the U.S. never formally declared that a coup had occurred.[41] By November 2009, the U.S. &quot;focused on pushing for elections&quot; in the country.[44] In September 2009, the Board of the U.S. Millennium Challenge Corporation, headed by Clinton, cut off $11 million in aid to the Honduran government in the wake of the coup, and suspended another $4 million in planned contributions to a road project.[45] From 2009 to mid-2016, however, the U.S. provided about $200 million in military and police aid to Honduras, a controversial decision given the violence in Honduras and the government\'s human rights violations.[46]&quot;&quot;
