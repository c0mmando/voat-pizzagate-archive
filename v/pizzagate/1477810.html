            The American Horror Story series on FX is an example of desensitizing via just one popular, mainstream network TV series. I watched all six seasons, and noticed an almost purposeful escalation in the graphic nature of the horror and the amount of care given to the plot. Mostly the drastic jump between S1 and S5. Season 1, with it's cut-away graphic horror, had some merit of a creative plot, and at least not endlessly-in-your-face graphic horror. Seasons 2-4 were not notable enough to me to remember details, except many of the same stars, demonizing Catholics, and capitalizing on creating cgi people with physical deformities. Season 5, shock value got upped. Humans being violently, sexually assaulted by unexplained, unidentifiable monsters who live in mattresses, with a stylized drill, with no relevance to the story at all. Innocent, other than being rude, human beings being murdered, then forgotten. A fraction away from pornography, starring Lady Gaga as an elite, nympho vampire, notably in a strikingly-great wardrobe, when she's not naked, having sex while constantly covered in blood. S6, Gaga again, as sexy, nympho head witch-of-the-woods. This last season of the series was reduced to nothing but a graphic and mostly-plotless parade of torture, fugue states, cannibalism, child abduction, human monsters wearing the heads of decapitated pigs, corrupt and inept police, and ZERO good guys. This is today's entertainment. Jessica Lange's star power in AHS was replaced by Lady Gaga. Understandable, considering the naked porn required, but in previous seasons, she took lesser degrading roles, and I wonder what she thinks about these things.

            I know there are more pressing issues, and my critique of a tv series is just my take. But, I've thought about this since long before pizzagate came along to bring these current things to daylight.

            Sorry for my naivety. I've heard the music but haven't watched the videos. AND...I really didn't know they had to be sell outs. Seeing it all in a new light.(or lack of)

            You're right.   I never watched the video but I used to sing with the song!!
gaaaaah

            Un-lady Gaga was in your face, but this dude is more subtle.  Normal people don't think this could happen,  so we dismiss it,  but it's desensitization.
            <br/>
            2:16  he's grinding on dead animal in the killroom and 2:33 he's dancing with it. 
 at 3:28 on there's frame clips of him having sex and then cuts to him embracing the dead carcass.
            <br/>
            3:54 they're having sex with  the appearance of blood dripping down on them. 
at 4:00 there's a frame of him laughing hysterically,  yeah,  I bet it's real funny for these f'ers to be part of the desensitization program.

            I don't know what world I'm living in, but it's ain't mine.    No wonder the world is dying from being sprayed and Monsanto  seeded, oceans dying, sky polluting.     Evil scum just degenerates and degrades everything, from music to food, to water, to children.... everything this virus evil touches turns into a cancer on the planet.

            Horrific video. And you're right, we're desensitized to it. It has been forced upon on so slowly that it is no longer shocking. It's just a wild ass music video. What the hell is wrong with Adam Levine? Did he, too, have to sell his soul to the devil for fame and fortune?
