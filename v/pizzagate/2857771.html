<p>&quot;Nazir Afzal is a former Chief Prosecutor for North West England. He was interviewed very briefly on the Radio 4 PM programme on 19th October. In the interview he made a quite astonishing claim which does not seem to have received the publicity it deserves so we thought it worth publicizing here. He said <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/sounds/play/m0000sf1">(@34minutes)</a>:</p>
<p>“You may not know this, but … back in 2008 the Home office sent a circular to all police forces in the country saying “as far as these young girls who are being exploited in towns and cities, we believe they have made an informed choice about their sexual behaviour and therefore it is not for you police officers to get involved in.”</p>
<p>Although we do not have the full text of the circular, this description seems to strongly suggest that it was a blanket instruction which did not contain any reference to the girls’ ages. If so this is direct evidence of the UK government of that time at the very least condoning statutory rape of children and really giving the green light to the police to ignore far worse crimes. In other words, police inaction in these cases was a deliberate policy and the instruction came directly from the then Labour government.</p>',

            Why aren't the men of England gathering in "darkness" (zero cell phones, tablets, computers etc) around for 10 /20 miles and planning on how to take out those who continue to push and uphold these rules/laws ?  Have they simply become so comfortable on their knees groveling that they don't know anything else ? 
Or do their simply value their slave roles that they'd simply chose that over possible death ? 
I'm confused. Of course, I'm not a weak as fuck limey cunt whose allowed his country to be taken over, my women raped for "games" , etc.

              eh, organizing for protests ? like carrying signs and crying for cameras that aren't there ? 
My family comes first. I'd be slitting throats in the knights, kidnapping and bashing in skulls and having groups of guys gathering supplies to bound them and weigh them down in lakes or work pits. But ...I might be a little protective.

            <em>
             Just found this little gem:
            </em>
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             <strong>
              Labour MP reports Katie Hopkins to police for 'inciting racial hatred' in Rochdale scandal
             </strong>
            </p>
            <p>
             She sent a series of tweets after Mr Danczuk commemorated Pakistan’s National Day by attending the raising of the nation’s flag over the town hall on March 23.
            </p>
            <p>
             In one tweet she wrote: "Raising a Pakistani flag in Rochdale is not helping community cohesion. it is inflammatory.
             <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/u/SimonDanczuk">
              @SimonDanczuk
             </a>
             you &amp; your party disgust me."
            </p>
            <p>
             After seeing the MP tweet a photograph of himself at the event, Hopkins sent a picture of eight men convicted of child sexual exploitation offences, asking Mr Danczuk if they were his friends too.
            </p>
            <p>
             Labour MP Simon Danczuk, who represents the town, has emailed Greater Manchester’s Police and Crime Commissioner Tony Lloyd, asking him to investigate whether a crime has been committed.
            </p>
            <p>
             He said she may have incited racial hatred by associating the Pakistani flag with the grooming of young girls - a scandal which has rocked the area.
            </p>
            <p>
             He said former Celebrity Big Brother contestant and Sun newspaper columnist Hopkins had “incited hatred”.
            </p>
            <p>
             Mr Danczuk added: "The letter is me asking the Police Commissioner to investigate whether a crime has been committed in relation to Katie Hopkins.
            </p>
            <p>
             "Rochdale is a very cohesive community - people work well together.
            </p>
            <p>
             "Of course there are tensions, like there are in other communities, but people rub together really well and we don't need outsiders like Katie Hopkins to come in and cause trouble just for the sake of causing trouble and creating Sun headlines."

             Was Gordon Brown their pimp minister...? Was MAdelien taken to portugal as part of a menu ordered by the podestas..
Was there communication between podestas and gordon brown in the missing emails?
Did it go all wrong ...in the sense that she ended up dead..
Did the Mc Canns pimp their daughter out to the uk elite pedo scene ...
All these questions need to be asked?
Wasnt dunblane massacre also connected to Gordon Brown?

            I can tell you for a fact it was known about 18 years ago as a problem up and down the country from a copper. I have known about it for 20 years after witnessing a friend getting out of a car being threatened and talking about it with a social worker, who said "we (the local authority) know about it but there are social concerns", But I've heard 40 to 50 years. And like I said they knew it was happening to schoolgirls.
           </p>
           <p>
            I didn't know about this, but it doesn't shock me.
           </p>
           <p>
            It is not an "informed choice" to accept a ride from a paki who then picks up his friends to get driven into the middle of no-where and threatend to be abandoned if they don't do everything they want. Which is to be gang raped then threatened to have their family set on fire if they say anything.  THAT IS A FUCKING CRIME.
           </p>
           <p>
            Not getting into a car because its driven by a Paki "THATS RACIS' "
           </p>
           <p>
            If they didn't get into their cars because they didn't want to be raped there would be a "lets not be racis' " campaign in schools to encourage it, and "concern for community cohesion" or some other bollocks.
           </p>
           <p>
            The fucking pigs who let this happen are fucking complicit.

             actually it sounds like you don't know much about it at all.
            </p>
            <p>
             near 100%  are latchkey kids of single moms (by choice) who exchange very small gifts for sex and end up getting passed around.  we know this because they admit to it.
            </p>
            <p>
             pretty pathetic how UK adults take no responsibility for their degenerate alcoholic culture -- do you understand that your girls are notorious as the biggest sluts in the entire world?  clearly they don't value their sexuality.

             I always ask British girls when they lost their virginity, and they are not at all ashamed to say 14.

              Latchkey kids from single moms (by choice) near 100% eh? Your the one who doesn't know shit.
             </p>
             <p>
              It would happen to girls in stable families, kids in care, families working 4 jobs between 2 parents to afford to live in a nice area,  who would be GROOMED, given gifts and shit to garner trust by a lad more their own age, so when they were in a car driven to a house for a "gathering" with someone they trust, they wouldn't expect it to be full of middle aged predators nor would they expect to be gang raped in an unfamiliar area, or that something like that would ever happen or that
              <a href="https://www.standard.co.uk/news/crime/underage-girls-lured-by-social-media-to-sex-and-drug-uck-parties-a3879786.html">

             </p>
             <p>
              If you haven't bought gifts for a girl you like, then your a fucking degenerate, If you think a girl owes you sex because you spent money then your a fucking degenerate.
             </p>
             <p>
              What about the two fathers who were arrested outside the house their underage girls were being raped in, They were out looking for their kids?
             </p>
             <p>
              The only thing you got right, well mostly, but even a broken clock is right twice a day, was that it didn't happen over night, mostly, that's how GROOMING works! Dumbass, Your the fucking retard. How many sexual partners can a girl have before being a slut? Is it okay to gang rape sluts now?

             <p>
              How many women has your mother fucked? by your rationale is she eligible to taken to strange place by someone she trusts because she was naive enough to believe she could trust them? And gang raped by men twice her age? and threatened with having her kid set on fire if she didn't. Would she love her idiot kid enough? Branded by coat hanger heated by a blow torch.

               I see you’ve had an encounter with our resident “white sharia” faggot. He’s a big time shill who defends muslims whenever anyone makes a topic about them.

               As the comments below show, he’s a psychopath, like all white sharia types are. Also a pedophile.

              <p>
               Don’t worry, white sharia people are LOATHED even by other white nationalists because they consider them to be “disgusting psychopaths who ALL need to be hunted down and impaled Vlad the Impaler style”.

               LOL.  theres no such thing as a free lunch (some 'grooming victims' were literally prostituting themselves for a free lunch of takeaway).  if your girls are naive enough to believe a guy giving them gifts wants nothing in return, that's an argument for MY position to restrict their behavior (i.e. "parenting").

               lol we used to punish rape victims like the Muslims do.  it's called a deterrent; she's not supposed to be alone with strange men, period, for precisely this reason.  Indeed she should be under her fathers protection before passed to her loving husband, as was also our custom.  Rape was ALWAYS CONSIDERED A PROPERTY CRIME AGAINST THE HUSBAND.

They may imply hope for something, but the acceptance of a gift is not and has never been an explicit invitation for gang rape, and until reading the bullshit that you have typed I never would have believed that even an inbred cross eyed piece of shit could use a kebab as justification for rape.

             While Russia under Putin has done some very good things on the world stage, including getting a UN resolution passed protecting the "traditional family values of nation states" (or words to that effect, which "western" nations opposed but passed anyway). Russia has very similar elites running it to the US/UK etc. Cold War 1 was completely fake (see Anthony Sutton's book on who funded the Bolsheviks to power - he also lists the names of directors of the companies doing the funding, which makes it very clear.). Solzhenitsyn points out exactly who the Bolsheviks were. It wasn't a "Russian" revolution, which was why the Jewish Bolsheviks were happy to slaughter the entire Russian leadership, all funded from the west, particularly the US.
            </p>
            <p>
             Cromwell's revolution was very much along a simliar line, just not as bloody. Check out Jan Irwin's channel Logos Media on Youtube for some recent videos on who the Puritans were (key to the English revolution, and not Christian as it turns out, easy to verify for yourself).
            </p>
            <p>
             Essentially, you have three empires with the same ethnic group running the show in the end. British, American and Soviet. They weren't the only ones either. There is a very interesting book on who the Young Turks and Attaturk were. Again, a crypto Jewish revolution. Similar to our colour revolutions run by the US and EU today.
            </p>
            <p>
             Note that the Oligarchs of Russia today, were the commisars of the past. The first 5 year plan for the Soviets was created by a unit of Harvard Uni. That same unit was the architect of Perestroika and Russia's asset sales to insiders.  That same unit also was involved in the asset sales fraud in NZ (American academic Michael Porter was part of that unit) which perhaps was a trial run for the Soviet Union's asset sales program. The same propaganda was used in both countries with regard to selling off "sunset industries" like oil, gas, coal, telecommunications, rail, steel, basically  anything of value that could be stolen.
            </p>

             The point is. Russia is run by the same group that runs the US and UK. Has the Russian branch had a change of heart? I hope so. It would be wonderful if Putin had a genuine love of his people, and they certainly love him for taking the boot off their throats. He has done great things for Russia. But is it genuine? It's actually hard to know. Is Cold War 2 genuine? Again, it's hard to know. I hope so... but Russia's leadership put another nation ahead of the one they control.

              Damned if you do and damned if you don't. You are one heck of a historian. I stand firm in my conviction that all royalty should be exterminated. And we the people must fight fight fight.

            I wouldn't be surprised if Jacinda Adern (NZ current Prime Minister) had a hand in that because she worked for the UK police back in 2008 and was involved in covering up and excusing police activities involving sexual crimes against children.

              I've attached a quote from Wikipedia, and offer my interpretation of that. Ardern was once made leader of an international communist group (International Union of Socialist Youth) that trains people to be politicians in "democracies" and one of that group's key goals was open borders (suicidal immigration for the formerly Christian nations). She came to power here in New Zealand in part on a platform to actually control our suicidal immigration. The following snippet indicates she was groomed to be PM from very early on (similar to John Key in my view). It says that for at least part of 2008 she was some part of an 80 person policy advisor unit to Blair. It's possible she knew of, or was involved in the policy of allowing the systematic abuse of British girls, since she was involved in that policy unit in some way. But obviously, she was simply involved in a policy advice unit, and not staying there long term. Ultimately the blame must lie with Blair and others more senior than her for that particular crime. It think its also fair to say though, she is of the same mind set.
             </p>
             <blockquote>
              <p>
               Ardern joined the Labour Party at a young age, and became a senior figure in the Young Labour sector of the party. After graduating from university, she spent time working in the offices of Phil Goff and of Helen Clark as a researcher. After a period of time volunteering at a soup kitchen in New York City,[20] Ardern moved to London to work as a senior policy adviser in an 80-person policy unit of then-British Prime Minister Tony Blair.[4] (She never met Blair in London, but did question him about the invasion of Iraq at an event in New Zealand in 2011.[21]) Ardern was also seconded to the Home Office to help with a review of policing in England and Wales.[18]
              </p>
              <p>
               In early 2008, Ardern was elected as the President of the International Union of Socialist Youth,[5] a role which saw her spend time in several countries, including Jordan, Israel, Algeria and China.[18]
