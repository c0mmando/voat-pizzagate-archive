            I have been surrounding by perps for over 20 years due to me trying to find out something concerning my children.These agencies that carry out covering up say high level pedophilia, modern mkultra mind control and hidden technologies(notice I didn't say advanced because it isn't, most simply don't know it exists) are very well versed in how to infiltrate. It can take a 'normal' person and turn them paranoid but for good reason. Yes, we are flooded with perps on here, probably since day one. The weak at heart will back off and not post as much. Keep in mind, the only thing to fear is fear itself. Fuck em if they are all over. If people try to engage you either call them out or ignore them. Ridicule is a common tactic. Generally the bad guys have this mean spiritnest to them.If you come across that, question for sure who is behind it. Flattering however also can be a bad sign. Just be aware
