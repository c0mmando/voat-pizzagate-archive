<p>Kids Shipped in Armoires? Names of missing kids used as cabinet models?   The Person Who Started the Wayfair Conspiracy Speaks</p>
<p>A new conspiracy theory surrounding products advertised by  Wayfair now joins previous unsubstantiated allegations like Pizzagate regarding worldwide pedophilic sex trafficking among the economic elite.</p>
<p>&quot;Is it possible Wayfair involved in Human trafficking with their WFX Utility collection? Or are these just extremely overpriced cabinets? (Note the names of the cabinets) this makes me sick to my stomach if it\'s true,&quot; redditor PrincessPeach1987 posted on Thursday, alongside a screenshot from Wayfair\'s mobile website featuring four storage cabinets—products named Neriah, Yaritza, Samiyah and Alyvia—that cost between $13k,and $15k</p>
<p>Newsweek reached out to Wayfair , including a request for an explanation of the high-priced items. The company provided</p>
<p>this statement in response:</p>
<p>&quot;There is, of course, no truth to these claims. The products in question are industrial grade cabinets that are accurately priced. Recognizing that the photos and descriptions provided by the supplier did not adequately explain the high price point, we have temporarily removed the products from site to rename them and to provide a more in-depth description and photos that accurately depict the product to clarify the price point.&quot;</p>
<p>The conspiracy theory has been elaborated on other social media platforms, particularly Twitter, expanding on the original post and its assertion that very expensive or overpriced cabinets with human names is in itself evidence of human trafficking conducted more or less in the open, with Wayfair offering humans for sale under the guise of selling cabinetry.</p>
<p>In chat conversations with Newsweek, PrincessPeach1987 described seeking out garage storage with their husband when they came across the expensive cabinet listings. While they at first surmised that they may have stumbled across unlisted drop shipping sales, Facebook posts also suspicious of the pricey listings made them more inclined to listen to their suspicions that there may be something more to the listings.</p>
<p>PrincessPeach1987, described themselves as &quot;involved in a local organization that helps victims of human trafficking,&quot; which has led her to be &quot;suspicious most of the time now.&quot; They characterized their Reddit post as less of a direct accusation and more of an effort to &quot;see if anyone else had more details.&quot;</p>
<p>Prominent arrests—like that of Jeffrey Epstein —have shown that extensive pedophilia networks do exist, but the &quot;details&quot; of the Wayfair theory do not make a credible case.</p>
<p>Subsequent elaborations on the theory included a user review on the Wayfair website for a previously unrelated, $5,000 fireproof filing cabinet, which included a 2016 user review from someone in Walnut Creek, California. The San Francisco exurb, with a population of more than 70,000, was also the location of a February arrest for human trafficking, child pornography and attempted kidnapping, which was allegedly connected to a wider child sex trafficking ring. &quot;Walnut Sauce&quot; is also an alleged code word central to Pizzagate conspiracy theories.</p>
<p>Supporters of the theory have also urged skeptics to use a Russian search engine to search for the stock keeping unit number (SKU) associated with various Wayfair products, which returns image results full of children in bathing suits. However, none of the SKU searches return images of a single child, which would seem to run counter to the implication that the Wayfair SKUs secretly provide data regarding the specific child to be purchased. In addition: following the search engine instructions with any random string of numbers returns the exact same results.</p>
<p>Supporters of the theory have also drawn connections to June 2019 protests by Wayfair employees, which objected to the company selling furnishings to a Texas detention facility for migrant children. The facility subsequently closed. However, protesting Wayfair employees never mentioned setting up public listings for humans.</p>
<p>Still, the Wayfair conspiracy theory has begun to take on a life of its own on social media and will likely become a part of the extensive mythology regarding child sex trafficking brought to national prominence in 2016 with Pizzagate.</p>

            Someone's comment about the misidentification:
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             5 hours ago
            </p>
            <p>
             The man in this photo is unidentified. Bill Hutcherson is not the President of Operations at Wayfair. This is completely bogus evidence that could've been solved by a quick Google search.
            </p>
            <p>
             Please don't let this sort of sloppiness become the norm of the sub, that's what makes people call these conspiracies crazy and unfounded

            I’m leaning towards believing this conspiracy, because I had a dream of a “cheap store” that was involved in human trafficking last month. Cheap store didn’t mean prices, it was the quality of things. I’ve been known to have dreams that come true, so I listed this particular dream below.

            Worked across and got caught up in a possible human trafficking scheme. I accidentally got caught in it and would put an end to it. It was a cheap store, like dollar general. The owners took advantage of people even though they seemed nice. I accidentally stayed inside past closing and noticed all the sudden work abuse. I was able to convince one girl to escape with me.
