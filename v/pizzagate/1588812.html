<p>According to a blog written by Robin Forestal, a staff member at NPH, Bill Clinton had planned a private visit to Friends of the Orphans, the orphanage that child-trafficker Laura Silsby was given children from, two months prior to the Earthquake. We derived this date by comparing the photo\'s filenames with other documented times (filename P1180312.jpg in relation to P1180452.JPG, which was taken on Thanksgivings). Alongside a photo of Molly Hightower and Erin Kloos of Friends of the Orphans, two volunteers who died from the orphanage\'s collapse during the Earthquake, Forestal wrote:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;This is Erin and Molly on their way to see <strong>Bill Clinton</strong> at one of our street schools. This is Erin and Molly afterwards - he didn\'t show up.&quot; <a href="http://i.imgur.com/JxfuLzC.png">http://i.imgur.com/JxfuLzC.png</a> </p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is evidence that Bill Clinton, who is famous for boarding the Lolita Express 26 times, is connected with Friends of the Orphans. No information is available regarding Bill Clinton\'s visit to Haiti between November-December, while his last documented visit was during October. This points to the theory that Bill Clinton has personal connections with someone within Friends of the Orphans. To top it off, it was scheduled a few days prior to Thanksgivings, and a month prior to Laura Silsby\'s initial visit to Haiti. Private matters?</p>

<p>This may explain why there was no investigation done into the orphanage in question, nor any statements made by a representative of the orphanage, and also why Laura Silsby was let off so easily. After all, as a reputable orphanage, wouldn\'t you want to clear any misunderstandings? Because the spotlight was shone at Laura Silsby, the surrounding suspicions were buried. It was a Freudian slip by <a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1565742">Jorge Puello, wanted child-trafficker</a> who had represented Silsby as a lawyer in a <a href="https://archive.org/details/FOXNEWS_20100202_030000_Greta_Van_Susteren/start/2820/end/2880">Fox News interview</a>, that revealed this connection.</p>
<hr />
<h1>Clarifications on the Silsby case</h1>
<p>Laura Silsby had attempted to traffic children twice, and was arrested on her second attempt at the Dominican border with 33 children. These 33 children had parents, and were gathered at Calabasse by pastor Jean Sainvil, who fled the country the day after Silsby was arrested. It was the first attempt where Friends of the Orphans came to play, when Silsby was caught trying to load a different group of 40 children onto the bus in Petionville, which is where the collapsed building of Friends of the Orphans was located, after a concerned citizen had reported to a police officer of suspicious activity.</p>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>The day after he met Silsby, Sainvil collected the 13 children from Citron. A day after that, the missionaries&quot; bus was halted at the Dominican border and they were arrested. Sainvil, meanwhile, became sick with &quot;vomiting and diarrhea&quot; and decided to fly back to the U.S. on a military transport plane, he said. <a href="https://archive.is/iEnFk#selection-827.1-827.310">https://archive.is/iEnFk#selection-827.1-827.310</a></p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;The officer said he discovered Silsby and the nine other Americans on a bus in <strong>Port-au-Prince\'s Pétionville neighborhood</strong> after receiving a tip from a concerned citizen.&quot; <a href="https://archive.is/lMmHp">https://archive.is/lMmHp</a> </p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>Molly Hightower, 22, was on the fifth floor of a seven-story <strong>orphanage building in Petionville</strong> when it collapsed, the organization that runs the orphanage told her father Mike Hightower of Port Orchard. <a href="https://archive.is/wcYOl">https://archive.is/wcYOl</a> </p>
</blockquote>
<hr />

<p>PUELLO: There was an <strong>orphanage that collapsed in Haiti. It was called friends of the orphans of Haiti</strong>.

</blockquote>
<h1>Additional Notes</h1>
<p>To clarify for any skeptics who believe this could have been a coincidence or a lie from Jorge Puello. Aside from the fact that there are around <a href="https://archive.is/10DkI#selection-583.0-583.136">760 orphanages in Haiti</a>, the reason this cannot be a fabrication is because the name of the orphanage which Jorge Puello used was its English variant, &quot;Friends of the Orphans&quot;, which Puello could not have known unless he was told. This is because the orphanage is known in Haiti as Nos Petits Freres et Soeurs, which translates to &quot;Our Little Brothers and Sisters&quot;, and not &quot;Friends of the Orphans&quot;. <a href="https://archive.is/0qKdd#selection-531.37-531.473">The staff call it NPFS</a>, and not even the <a href="http://i.imgur.com/zrEsGkt.png">signs outside of the building</a> writes &quot;Friends of the Orphans&quot;. It\'s simply not plausible.</p>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>Molly Mackenzie Hightower graduated from the University of Portland last year. Unlike many of her peers who chose to pursue a career post graduation, Hightower flew out to Haiti in June for a year of volunteering with <strong>Friends of the Orphans, which operates Nuestros Pequeños Hermanos/Nos Petit Freres et Soeurs (NPH/NPFS, Spanish and French for “Our Little Brothers and Sisters”)</strong> in Haiti. <a href="https://archive.is/6GIhn">https://archive.is/6GIhn</a></p>
</blockquote>
<h1>Pointers for Investigators</h1>
<p>According to Molly Hightower\'s (Earthquake victim) <a href="https://archive.is/6Igp9#selection-419.0-419.254">blog</a>, a group of American visitors had visited Friends of the Orphans at the same time Laura Silsby and Charisa Coulter made their visit in late December, when they had supposedly <a href="http://i.imgur.com/Mwe1WxZ.png">visited “three” unspecified orphanages.</a> Could it be them? </p>
<p><a href="http://harvardhrj.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/King.pdf">This</a> and <a href="https://books.google.com.au/books?id=S7Y05pL-rakC&amp;pg=&amp;redir_esc=y">this</a> are good references for the Silsby case, but keep in mind that the second one was written by one of the primary suspects\' parents. It has numerous inconsistencies, for example the author wrote that the missionaries returned to Santo Domingo on the 26th of January, while pastor Jean Sainvil claims to have <a href="https://archive.is/cahQo#selection-1223.0-1223.252">met Laura Silsby in Ouanaminthe on January 27</a> which doesn\'t add up. <a href="http://i.imgur.com/XOwowrb.png">Look how far apart they are</a>. So take it with a grain of salt.</p>
<p>There were more connections between Friends of the Orphans and Laura Silsby\'s hometown, Boise, Idaho, than we expected. You may want to check them out, as they may clue into how Laura Silsby connected with the people at the orphanage. For example, <a href="https://archive.is/u9mny#selection-233.0-233.118">the owner annually visits Boise</a>, and <a href="https://archive.is/plNb2">Project Haiti is based in Boise too</a>. </p>

           , the reason this cannot be a fabrication is because the name of the orphanage which Jorge Puello used was its English variant, "Friends of the Orphans", which Puello could not have known unless he was told. This is because the orphanage is known in Haiti as Nos Petits Freres et Soeurs, which translates to "Our Little Brothers and Sisters", and not "Friends of the Orphans".

           , a group of American visitors had visited Friends of the Orphans at the same time Laura Silsby and Charisa Coulter made their visit in late December, when they had supposedly
           <a href="http://i.imgur.com/Mwe1WxZ.png">

           are good references for the Silsby case, but keep in mind that the second one was written by one of the primary suspects' parents. It has numerous inconsistencies, for example the author wrote that the missionaries returned to Santo Domingo on the 26th of January, while pastor Jean Sainvil claims to have
           <a href="https://archive.is/cahQo#selection-1223.0-1223.252">

           There were more connections between Friends of the Orphans and Laura Silsby's hometown, Boise, Idaho, than we expected. You may want to check them out, as they may clue into how Laura Silsby connected with the people at the orphanage. For example,

            There must be a good reason why Romania in 2005 and then Russia in 2013 put the brakes on intercountry adoptions particularly to the US. In Russia in 2009 there were 1586 children adopted by US citizens and in 2015, none. Romania now requires that the adopting US citizen be of Romanian descent and same sex parents can not jointly adopt. In the 1990s untold thousands of Romanian children were placed abroad with no detailed record keeping. Look at this article about US pedophiles in Romania at that time: "American Kurt Treptow was also jailed in Iasi for the same reason. His case was made worse by the fact that the US ambassador to Romania at the time Michael Guest who had already caused deep disgust to Romanians when appointed as brought his male lover to live with him in Bucharest plied thankfully without success for Treptow’s release from jail in Iasi.http://poundpuplegacy.org/node/41930,

They ended up doing a complete overworking of the tap tap room, with all my abandoned babies being sent out (including Carmella and Cassandra).

           <blockquote>

             Substantial evidence subsequently emerged to support the contention that Negroponte was aware that serious violations of human rights were carried out by the Honduran government, but despite this did not recommend ending U.S. military aid to the country. Senator Christopher Dodd of Connecticut, on September 14, 2001, as reported in the Congressional Record, aired his suspicions on the occasion of Negroponte's nomination to the position of UN ambassador:

            Wow, Silsby wasn't the only one removing children who weren't orphans after the earthquake.  According to this blogger who has posted a slew of links, it sounded like a "free for all" with children being flown out on private planes, military aircraft, shipped to the Netherlands, the US etc etc.   Even the Governor of PA flew down to Haiti and flew back with 54 children who weren't "processed" meaning it hadn't been documented that the children were actually orphans.
           </p>
           <p>
            From a letter written to the State Dept 3 days after the quake:
           </p>
           <p>
            " Within three days of the earthquake, Catholic Charities of Miami had set up a scheme modeled on Operation Pedro Pan, a joint State Department-CIA-Miami Diocese project in the early 1960s to separate children from their parents, creating young pawns in the US war against the Castro government. Although “Operation Pierre Pan” in Haiti is on hold, at least for now, numerous evangelical churches and ministries, adoption agencies, secular organizations, unfinalized adoptive parents and other individuals--many with conflicts of interest--have joined the rescue mission call to remove children immediately, no matter what their family status, to the US for the purpose of adoption."

              Gov. Rendell was mentioned in the blog but there were also two links provided on him, one has been scrubbed and the other was to the NYT which I couldn't access because I'm not a subscriber.    This blog is interesting as there are a lot of Haiti links and I've only gone through a few of them.

            Good catch. I just did a thorough review of Wikileaks. I had read about the "Haitian special" but cannot find a direct link. It was a pretty thorough search, so maybe I conflated it with other items. I will remove. Thanks.

             the "haitian special" was a comment on one of alefantis' instagram pics. however i believe it occurred after pizzagate came to light but before alefantis made his instagram private, so it was pretty likely to just be one of us.

             Ok, so let me give you some empirical evidence. Four years ago this month I was about 6 weeks pregnant, and doing my dishes before my husband came home from work. All of a sudden I, as well as four other people in my apartment complex felt rumbling of the ground, then a loud humming that was so loud that I couldn't hear myself think or anything. It consumed my entire body down into the pit of stomach. 
I and the other tenents in this small apartment complex of about 2 buildings and 20 apartments went outside to see our landlord. It went on for 15 minutes exactly down to the second. When it ended, we all walked up to each other and the landlord and was like what was that, when our landlord stated go inside right now and google the word HAARP program, and you'll see there is a HAARP facility on The Lake of the Ozarks, which wasn't far from where I was living at at that point in time.
            </p>
            <p>
             There were two other women that lived in that complex that was pregnant and within two weeks, all 3 of us had miscarried after that incident. We were 6, 11, and 13 weeks. Now I have two kids and one of the ladies had 3 kids. You may try to debunk that my miscarriage was because of something else or that I'm crazy but I know what I believe and that is that HAARP and shit like that exist not only to control the weather but also as a means of population control.

             It is a crazy path I'd say this sub has largely avoided, despite the indisputable fact that man-made earthquakes are entirely possible. Do a quick search and see the completely mainstream articles about it... The timing of the Clintons in Haiti is shady as fuck.

            So the Clintons had ties to the Silsby kidnapping racktet before the missionaries were arrested? You don't say.

           <p>
            Here I was

            She only intervened because

             Jim Allen

             Brown says the group has assembled what he called a "dream team" for Allen that now includes Wilmer government affairs partner Benjamin Powell; Jackson Walker associate Amanda Bush and Mullin Hoard &amp; Brown's Jeffrey Ritter in Amarillo; Liberty Legal's Hiram Sasser; and local counsel Louis Gary Lissade in Port au Prince. (Lissade is a former minister of justice and two-time president of the Haitian Bar Association; Bush is married to former President George W. Bush's eldest nephew, George P. Bush; and Powell is the former general counsel for the Director of National Intelligence under Presidents Bush and Obama.)

             It's my understanding that some of the team was from Texas, but they were on the Dominican Republic side. They left the island as soon as Silsby got caught.

               The orphanage Silsby was creating wasn't actually completed yet, so they were still working on it. Keep in mind, they were taking kids from Haiti and then bringing them to their orphanage in the Dominican Republic with the hopes of having them adopted out to the USA. Legitimate adoption agencies simply don't take children across international borders and then have them adopted out to yet another country. Why not just build the orphanage in Haiti if they are legitimate?

                What we can deduce about their MO so far: mislead, corrupt and control a congregation - in this case, East Side and Central Valley Baptist Churches - involve them with and take them to a 'crisis spot' - barter/buy/kidnap children - have another team (or cell, or group from a different state etc.) ready at the other side, even to take the fall (as in Silsby's case) - sell the children, - launder the money (where's Silsby's?), rinse, repeat.

            </a>
            ) that Monica Petersen had written on the Human Trafficking Center website that was scrubbed out of existence on its site and from the Wayback machine. Why all the effort to erase this history? Easy: Because it contradicts the major lie contained in the Washington Post "fake news" cover-up story, which claims that Monica Petersen was not looking into human trafficking.This fact exposes HTC to be active participants in the cover up of her true story.

            Nice but why is it incriminating for puello to call the orphanage by the English/US NPH name, when talking to an English speaking US reporter?
Perhaps his French is poor, or he doesn't know if Greta speaks French?

            I am not defending the convicted scum Puello, or Silsby, by any means. Maybe I am missing something, but I just want to understand OP's thinking here?

             It was a clarification for people who believe that Jorge Torres made it up on the spot. He couldn't have known the orphanage's English name, unless he was told by somebody who knew about the orphanage. This is because you couldn't get the name "Friends of the Orphans" from the French/Spanish name that it is known for in Haiti. If Puello translated it, he would have called it "Our Little Brothers and Sisters". Hence, this leads to the conclusion that Laura Silsby did in fact receive children from the orphanage.

              Yeah, I guess it boils down to that. They're merciless. Without remorse. Very sad ... for the kids I mean. Can you imagine a little child dealing with these monsters? So frightening.

            This is a major find and continues to beg the same question asked by Ben Swann. Where is the investigation (meme:
            <a href="https://archive.is/hXGAY">
             https://archive.is/hXGAY)
            </a>
            )?
           </p>
           <p>
            The Silsby and Petersen cases looked to be very important based on:
           </p>
           <ul>
            <li>
             <p>
              The specifics of what happened with Laura Silsby, a very well-documented case of a large-scale kidnapping that could not be misunderstood. She had even been warned prior to the attempt to traffic 33 children (
              <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/The_Donald/comments/5aupnh/breaking_i_believe_i_have_connected_a_convicted/">
               https://www.reddit.com/r/The_Donald/comments/5aupnh/breaking_i_believe_i_have_connected_a_convicted/
              </a>
              AND
              <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/v/pizzagate/1458272">
               https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1458272)
              </a>
              )
             </p>
            </li>
            <li>
             <p>
              It is very suspicious how the State Department intervened for Silsby and seemed to be very interested in her situation...with Hillary showing knowledge of her on a first-name basis in the email communications. She got off with a slap on the wrist after having been represented by an attorney, who himself, it turns out, was convicted to be a pedophile.
             </p>
            </li>
            <li>
             <p>
              Despite this history, Silsby was hired and is a high-level executive with the company that issues Amber Alerts, a key piece in the machine to help provide intelligence to the human-trafficking ring and/or aid and abet their crimes:
              <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/v/pizzagate/1577190">

              </a>
             </p>
            </li>
            <li>
             <p>
              Silsby is connected to JA (
              <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/v/pizzagate/1467612">
               https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1467612)
              </a>
              ). Reddit banned the pizzagate subreddit after we started connecting the dots on these various connections (Silsby/Haiti to Clinton/JA):

             </p>

            <li>
             <p>
              Monica Petersen was investigating the child-trafficking connections with Haiti. Details can be found here:
              <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/v/pizzagate/1417320">
               https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1417320
              </a>
              and here
              <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/v/pizzagate/1428193">
               https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1428193
              </a>
              . The Washington Post went out of its way to explicitly dismiss any connection of the death of Monica Petersen with such an investigation (another pizzagate conspiracy that they "debunked"):
              <a href="http://archive.is/SWJ1y">
               http://archive.is/SWJ1y
              </a>
              Who writes a news story about a death to explicitly deny the "fake news" element? Our "fake news" is not being presented in the media, so they must be closely watching the links we make and then try to discredit us when we seem to be making inroads. Meanwhile, the mother does not buy the story that her daughter committed suicide:
              <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/v/pizzagate/1472539">
               https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1472539
              </a>
             </p>
            </li>
            <li>
             <p>
              At the time of her death, her boss (Claude d'Estree, former Dyncorp) claimed that they would make sure to release her 110-page report on her research into child trafficking...then this went silent. It was captured in a live stream (39:30 mark of the stream), but I cannot find the original video as I believe the thread was erased online.
             </p>
            </li>
            <li>
             <p>
              The Haitian people have been trying for years to let us know about this corruption:

             Also the day before our sub-Reddit was shut down there was a thread of a young woman who had just, a few weeks earlier escaped being trafficked, with this Irish traveller Gypsy fellow being her handler who wound up being arrested somewhere in North Carolina. I've looked into archives for that dang thread and can't find it for anything. If you are reading this, the girl who started that thread, I know I can't be the only one that was praying for your protection and even offered if you are in the Southern part of the US, you do have a safe place to stay in my home.

             -Devestation when I went to the hospital to discover my Jolene girl had been transferred to an unknown orphanage the evening before. I don't know where she is, but I'm trying to find her to force her caregivers to bring her in for physical therapy. She was so close to walking on her own, and they left her orthopedic shoe behind. They ended up doing a complete overworking of the tap tap room, with all my abandoned babies being sent out (including Carmella and Cassandra). Annabelle is the only one still there.

             I think this sort of thing is what we need to look into with this new info. How shady is this friend-of-the-Clintons-run orphanage? I've been wanting to jump down this rabbit hole all day and haven't had time. What other info is in that blog?!

             I agree! How sick can someone be? I feel so bad for those volunteers that were being such great loving people dying because of these evil heartless bastards. I definitely believe they caused the earthquake. What these people do is so corrupt and twisted that it's no wonder everything is considered a conspiracy theory.

             I'll tell you what I told someone else: From what I have researched, it's my opinion that the earthquake was an obstacle. Silsby &amp; Co. didn't seem to be completely ready, and they seemed to have rushed things because of the earthquake. In my view, the earthquake is what created their sloppiness, so it wouldn't have made sense for her to be coordinating with a Clinton- or DynCorp-created earthquake.

             Seriously? The highest rated comment is a theory that the clintons caused an earthquake. The intent of this post will now be instantly dismissed because you didn't take your meds, or perhaps that was your agenda in the first place.

             So, the counter explanation will be that the Clintons have long been friends of this orphanage, perhaps via some personal connection.  So when the earthquake happened, it makes perfect sense that one of their USA friends (Silsby) would go down to rescue the kids after their building collapsed.  And then being a good person, she also tried to "rescue" 33 other kids, and the Haitian authorities got confused and didn't trust her for some reason.

              When it was happening, a church I visit for its weekly bible study, with missions to Haiti, brought up the news in our group. This was the line of thinking, minus tye Clintons.

              Not to digress or derail this thread but I don't know about you or anyone else, but my sky is CONSTANTLY filled with   trails. Now whether deliberate or an innocent manifestation of traffic... I won't debate anymore. But if my skies are affected then I HAVE to conclude, so is the weather.

               You start off with not wanting to derail, use CAPS and lots of .....s, then Chemtrails, then haarp. What about the reptile agenda, mandela, steel beams, the Montauk experiment, the moon being the death star and Saturn controlling the matrix, the grays, the Sirians, the fairy people, or the communcations of RA in the 80s?       Maybe  I didn't use enough CAPS and ...s for you to get the picture, but shut up already.

                 Hey, I agree with you. I think truth is much stranger than fiction. Just by my comment you should know I'm aware of all this stuff and find it fascinating.  The top comment though? And now metaphysical rabbit holes? Come on. That's what the Voat community thought was the most interesting or valid element here? Shill. Shill with a bunch of shill followers x3 I've never called out a shill till now, but if y'all want make something out of this, how bout we stick to the stuff that's actually workable? (Also, if you've been amused by kek theology, looked at if after election and not a trump voter, check out the web address).

                  I'm not a Kek person, I'm a Sabbath keeping Christian stay at home mom in the Southeastern part of the United States. This top comment is suspect and slightly sketchy from my perspective but that is neither here nor there. We all need to unite together, look past some of the bat guano crazy things that have been pointed out here and get to work trying to prosecute these people and save the children and young people being abused. 
I have my own ideas and theories about some things, and I imagine you do because we are individuals. Like for instance I believe that aliens are actually demons, and Satan will use that to get people to play into his hands and his rituals and way. Do you believe that? Probably not, but that is because you have your own ideas and theories.

                  So far we've done decent in the past few months, and are uncovering things on a daily basis, but that is because we all have a common goal, but every now and then I've noticed this since becoming a pizzagater literally the day after the election, that some shills will come along and they use the same boring things to throw people off track.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  This is one of those things, as well as if you see a post that all Jews (which btw I'm ethnically part Jewish on my mother's side) are evil and we're all in charge of this whole thing, as well as we all own the worlds banks, when in reality that is so far from the case it's hilarious. I can show ya'll screenshots from my bank account that has all of 130 dollars in it to last us from now until the 6th of next month. I know for myself I can't exactly take over the entire world with 130 dollars and a stack of about 900 dollars worth of coupons in my purse. I could probably coupon clip my way into feeding most of us pizzagaters but that is about all I can really do.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  What I'm saying is people are going to believe and promote in things that they believe themselves and we as individuals must decide whether that is right or wrong, and move from there.

                   Word up, shortymcbossypants, just got a bit pissed at this one since this post actually  dealt with the tangible. I'll try to not add to those trying to produce discord. Also with kek, I only looked at that stuff after election (didn't vote trump), but the side of me that enjoys metaphysical stuff got a kick out of it.

              That did occur to me, but the fact that Hillary Clinton sent suspected trafficker Jorge Puello Torres to pose as a lawyer to get Silsby out, pretty much torpedoes that idea.

                My understanding is that, no, Clinton didn't send Puello. The story is that Puello called and offered his "services." Either way, he did not act as lawyer for long and was replaced.

             This is what all this disruption is about in my opinion. I believe it is possible there was an agreement to put Trump in in order to stop the investigation into all of the crimes of HRC and the deep state.

             This is very important work the OP is doing and more importantly, the courage to put it out here. You really do have to go back and look at 9/11 and even Katrina if you are honest with yourself.

              Cathy O'Brien claims they did the same thing after the Bush debacle - by putting clinton in as a shell game to distract the global public. It was a case of "meet the new boss same as the old boss."

              Before the  Haiti eathquake  the then Canadian prime minister chose to remove the former canadian governor gemeral with a new one who originally came from Haiti and was an unknown who was  assigned  into one of the most powerful Canadian political positions as Govenor General for the Queen.
             </p>
             <p>
              Shortly after the Haiti quake she left the post to take a position in the UN  and provide  a foundation in her name for  child services for rhe Canadian aboriginals.  But today aboriginals claim that their children are  lost in the CPS child system. Im not seeing her great help in that area.  The governor general is a position that acts on behalf of The Queen Elizabeth in Canada.  A webpage described that she left the post at the time of the quake to assist as she had family in Haiti.

              The day before the cpp gunman incident I researched links and didn't know how to get screen shots. So I gave the info to someone here in hope that they could dig.  I haven't got any word as to that dig. I got duped because today I went back to the links describing  that Governor General from Haiti and the data has been edited from the days I checked it  prior to cpp gunmen.
             </p>
             <p>
              The original data stated that she wasnt well received  and provided reasons. Now that  specific data is gone.  I wonder if anyone can dig on her and her husbands aboriginal child projects or any potential connections.

             Dyncorp was behind the earthquake. Clinton affiliates moved in immediately to exploit the conditions in the aftermath and are still there. They use a tried and tested method of disruption to create an environment where child trafficking, money laundering and organ harvesting can happen. Watch George Webb's video series on YouTube for a detailed explanation.

              This is a major find and continues to beg the same question asked by Ben Swann. Where is the investigation (meme:
              <a href="https://archive.is/hXGAY">
               https://archive.is/hXGAY))
              </a>

             <p>
              The Silsby and Petersen cases looked to be very important based on:
             </p>
             <p>
              The specifics of what happened with Laura Silsby, a very well-documented case of a large-scale kidnapping that could not be misunderstood. She had even been warned prior to the attempt to traffic 33 children (
              <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/The_Donald/comments/5aupnh/breaking_i_believe_i_have_connected_a_convicted/">
               https://www.reddit.com/r/The_Donald/comments/5aupnh/breaking_i_believe_i_have_connected_a_convicted/
              </a>
              AND
              <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/v/pizzagate/1458272">
               https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1458272))
              </a>
              ))
             </p>
             <p>
              It is very suspicious how the State Department intervened for Silsby and seemed to be very interested in her situation...with Hillary showing knowledge of her on a first-name basis in the email communications. She got off with a slap on the wrist after having been represented by an attorney, who himself, it turns out, was convicted to be a pedophile.
             </p>
             <p>
              Despite this history, Silsby was hired and is a high-level executive with the company that issues Amber Alerts, a key piece in the machine to help provide intelligence to the human-trafficking ring and/or aid and abet their crimes:
              <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/v/pizzagate/1577190">

              </a>
             </p>
             <p>
              Silsby is connected to JA (
              <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/v/pizzagate/1467612">
               https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1467612))
              </a>
              )). Reddit banned the pizzagate subreddit after we started connecting the dots on these various connections (Silsby/Haiti to Clinton/JA):

              Monica Petersen was investigating the child-trafficking connections with Haiti. Details can be found here:
              <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/v/pizzagate/1417320">
               https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1417320

              and here

               https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1428193
              </a>
              . The Washington Post went out of its way to explicitly dismiss any connection of the death of Monica Petersen with such an investigation (another pizzagate conspiracy that they "debunked"):
              <a href="http://archive.is/SWJ1y">
               http://archive.is/SWJ1y
              </a>
              Who writes a news story about a death to explicitly deny the "fake news" element? Our "fake news" is not being presented in the media, so they must be closely watching the links we make and then try to discredit us when we seem to be making inroads. Meanwhile, the mother does not buy the story that her daughter committed suicide:
              <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/v/pizzagate/1472539">
               https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1472539
              </a>
             </p>
             <p>
              At the time of her death, her boss (Claude d'Estree, former Dyncorp) claimed that they would make sure to release her 110-page report on her research into child trafficking...then this went silent. It was captured in a live stream (39:30 mark of the stream), but I cannot find the original video as I believe the thread was erased online.
             </p>
             <p>
              The Haitian people have been trying for years to let us know about this corruption:

I don't know where she is, but I'm trying to find her to force her caregivers to bring her in for physical therapy. She was so close to walking on her own, and they left her orthopedic shoe behind. They ended up doing a complete overworking of the tap tap room, with all my abandoned babies being sent out (including Carmella and Cassandra). Annabelle is the only one still there.

Why all the effort to erase this history? Easy: Because it contradicts the major lie contained in the Washington Post "fake news" cover-up story, which claims that Monica Petersen was not looking into human trafficking.This fact exposes HTC to be active participants in the cover up of her true story.

             <p>
              So the Clintons had ties to the Silsby kidnapping racktet before the missionaries were arrested? You don't say.
             </p>
             <p>
              Here I was reading in all MSM that Clinton had no ties to Silsby whatsoever.
             </p>
             <p>
              She only intervened because Jim Allen, a self-employed construction worker from Texas, wrote to her via his high-powered lawyers Reginald Brown and Jennifer O'Connor. The former a high-end DC lawyer at a prestigious firm, the latter a former 'senior Clinton Administration aide'.
             </p>
             <p>
              So instead of Silsby cs., this ordinary construction worker from Texas - not Idaho, mind - acquires the best defensive team ever assembled in an international case:
             </p>
             <h2>
              Brown says the group has assembled what he called a "dream team" for Allen that now includes Wilmer government affairs partner Benjamin Powell; Jackson Walker associate Amanda Bush and Mullin Hoard &amp; Brown's Jeffrey Ritter in Amarillo; Liberty Legal's Hiram Sasser; and local counsel Louis Gary Lissade in Port au Prince. (Lissade is a former minister of justice and two-time president of the Haitian Bar Association; Bush is married to former President George W. Bush's eldest nephew, George P. Bush; and Powell is the former general counsel for the Director of National Intelligence under Presidents Bush and Obama.)

               Not sure why your post isn't flying to the top. People keep sayin there needs to be a victim. Monica Petersen sure looks like a victim who was an advocate for victims. Out of all I've seen, Monica seems like the most viable route to demand an investigation. If that domino falls, the CPP domino might fall also. Edit: starting to think there really is an army of trolls on here pushing the moloc tesla mandela topics to the top. For all you non bots. All that stuff is interesting, could even be true, but you can't force an investigation with a folder full of metaphysical evidence.

            Great work!  Can we postulate a reason why Bill Clinton was going there?  I am not joking.  Has got to be something other than sex with underage girls which he gets pretty much everywhere he goes.

             Simple, those the kids could be trafficked too, would be controlled by threat of disclosure. Political power often comes from the ability to blackmail. The franklin scandal exposed this.

              But the implication is that they had planned this before the earthquake, and just "lucked out" that the disaster would give them an excuse.

               I would actually argue that the earthquake was an obstacle they had to overcome. It forced them to hurry plans, things got sloppy, and that's why they made mistakes IMO.
