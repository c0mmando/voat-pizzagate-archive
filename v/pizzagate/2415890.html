<h1>Poisoning of Potomac River</h1>
<p>According to Lunev, a probable scenario in the event of war would have been poisoning the Potomac River with chemical or biological weapons, &quot;targeting the residents of Washington, D.C.&quot;[1] He also considered it &quot;likely&quot; that GRU operatives placed &quot;poison supplies near the tributaries to major US reservoirs.&quot;[9] These allegations have been confirmed by former SVR officer Kouzminov [10] who was responsible for transporting pathogens from around the world for Russian program of biological weapons in the 1980s and the beginning of the 1990s. He described a variety of biological warfare acts that would be carried out on the order of the Russian President in the event of hostilities, including poisoning public drinking-water supplies and food processing plants.[11]</p>

<p>In 2002, Bill Powell, former Moscow bureau chief at Newsweek, wrote Treason, an account of the experiences of former GRU colonel Vyacheslav Baranov, who had betrayed GRU for the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) and agreed to spy for it. He was exposed to the Russians by a mole in either the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) or the CIA and spent five years in prison before he was released. The identity of the mole remains unknown to this day, but speculation has mounted that it could have been Robert Hanssen.[43]</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Robert Philip Hanssen (born April 18, 1944) is a former Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) agent who spied for Soviet and Russian intelligence services against the United States for 22 years from 1979 to 2001. He is currently serving 15 consecutive life sentences at ADX Florence, a federal supermax prison near Florence, Colorado.</p>
<p>Hanssen was arrested on February 18, 2001, at Foxstone Park[2] near his home in Vienna, Virginia, and was charged with selling U.S. secrets to the Soviet Union and subsequently the Russian Federation for more than US$1.4 million in cash and diamonds over a 22-year period.[3]~~</p>

<p>As outlined in my comment(linked below in crumbs) regarding Podesta\'s wapo article, <a href="https://imgoat.com/uploads/647966b734/88379.png">we can see that there\'s a Westwood Country Club(&amp; Golf Course) right next to Foxstone Park</a>.</p>

</ul>

<ul>
<li>What I\'m looking for, is how the Country Club got it\'s name and if there\'s any relation to the WCC in Westwood, Missouri. Let\'s skip to the juicy parts:</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<h2>A BRIEF HISTORY OF WESTWOOD COUNTRY CLUB (Part I)</h2>
<p>~~At the start, the course consisted of nine greens played from eighteen sets of tees. On hand that day were local sports legends Shirley Povich (Washington Post), Morrie Sigel (Evening Star), Bus Ham (Washington Post), Maury Fitzgerald (Washington Times Herald) plus Horowitz, Garlem and his wife, Louella. Later that year additional greens sod was purchased from a nursery in Waterbury, CT and the 12th through 18th greens were prepared. The full 18-hole golf course was then in play.~~</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Put a pin in Washington Post again.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<h2>A BRIEF HISTORY OF WESTWOOD COUNTRY CLUB (Part II)</h2>
<p>Part I of this series described Westwood\'s formative years. To bring the reader up to date, from 1954-1958 Westbriar Country Club, Westwood\'s predecessor, was a semi-public golf course. In 1958 the club went private and the clubhouse and pool were built. The owner of the club was Leon Horowitz, a local developer.</p>
<p>Like many in the real estate and development game, Horowitz fell on hard times in the 1960-1961 years and mortgaged the club to finance his business. On February 12, 1962, the mortgage holder, Victor Orsinger, called the note and the club was padlocked by the Sheriff. Ernie Garlem\'s pro shop was locked up with his merchandise and the members\' clubs inside. Members were given a date and time to remove their belongings. February 12 was not a good day.</p>
<p>~~</p>
<h2>Interesting Anecdotes of this Period</h2>
<p>~~On Publicity: The June 7, 1964 Washington Post sports page noted: &quot;Westwood pro Ernie Garlem was a very embarrassed man last Thursday. His lady members were holding a Member Guest Tournament from a shotgun start…all the gals had taken their positions when Garlem realized he didn\'t have a gun.&quot;</p>
<p>From the August 16, 1964 Washington Post, &quot;Two years ago the members of the WCC purchased the Westbriar Club property for $1 million…The other day the value of the property was assessed at $3 million.&quot;~~</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So, even wapo seems to think that the WCC(presumably referring to Westwood Country Club in Westwood, Missouri) purchased or had a hand in purchasing and renaming what was once known as Westbriar Country Club. I beg the question again, why is John so mad about Hanssen and why is he 9/11 signalling in his wapo article? I think that there\'s a connection between the two and that John knows it.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>All of the above considered, I took a look at the Vienna, VA sex-offender\'s registry - go ahead and do the same:</strong> <a href="http://www.city-data.com/so/so-Vienna-Virginia.html">http://www.city-data.com/so/so-Vienna-Virginia.html</a></li>
</ul>
<p><em>Look for the first case of child-abuse, 2nd entry in the list. (I won\'t share the direct link, as there\'s a captcha and disclaimers; DO NOT USE INFO ON THIS SITE TO STALK/HARASS/HARM)</em></p>
<p>I think it\'s possible that the WCC(Vienna, VA) members are somehow related to the still-open case of sexual assault against a minor, that perhaps other Vienna, VA child sex abuse cases may also be related and that Hanssen\'s activities are also connected to some of this and that again, John Podesta(et al) knows all about it and/or is directly involved.</p>
<p>This might explain his deflecting and anger and 9/11 signalling, implying that it\'s all part of a larger network of child sex abuse and corruption - was 9/11 a punishment for other failings in the network? Was it a distraction from failings in the network? (network of child sex abuse and political corruption, etc).</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Hanssen wiki:</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<h1>Investigation and arrest</h1>
<p>~~During his final days with the FBI, Hanssen began to suspect that something was wrong; in early February 2001 he asked his friend at a computer technology company for a job. He also believed he was hearing noises on his car radio which indicated that it was bugged, although the FBI was later unable to reproduce the noises Hanssen claimed to have heard. In the last letter he wrote to the Russians, which was picked up by the FBI when he was arrested, Hanssen said that he had been promoted to a &quot;do-nothing job ... outside of regular access to information,&quot; and that, &quot;Something has aroused the sleeping tiger.&quot;[45]</p>
<p>However, his suspicions did not stop him from making one more dead drop. After dropping his friend off at the airport on February 18, 2001, Hanssen drove to Virginia\'s Foxstone Park.He placed a white piece of tape on a park sign, which was a signal to his Russian contacts that there was information at the dead drop site. He then followed his usual routine, taking a package consisting of a sealed garbage bag of classified material and taping it to the bottom side of a wooden footbridge over a creek.~~</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Who was the friend, I wonder... was anything suspicious going on at the computer tech company? Perhaps child-porn related?</p>

            A BRIEF HISTORY OF WESTWOOD COUNTRY CLUB (Part II)
           </h2>
           <p>
            Part I of this series described Westwood's formative years. To bring the reader up to date, from 1954-1958 Westbriar Country Club, Westwood's predecessor, was a semi-public golf course. In 1958 the club went private and the clubhouse and pool were built. The owner of the club was Leon Horowitz, a local developer.
           </p>
           <p>
            Like many in the real estate and development game, Horowitz fell on hard times in the 1960-1961 years and mortgaged the club to finance his business. On February 12, 1962, the mortgage holder, Victor Orsinger, called the note and the club was padlocked by the Sheriff. Ernie Garlem's pro shop was locked up with his merchandise and the members' clubs inside. Members were given a date and time to remove their belongings. February 12 was not a good day.
           </p>

           <h2>
            Interesting Anecdotes of this Period
           </h2>
           <p>
            ~~On Publicity: The June 7, 1964 Washington Post sports page noted: "Westwood pro Ernie Garlem was a very embarrassed man last Thursday. His lady members were holding a Member Guest Tournament from a shotgun start…all the gals had taken their positions when Garlem realized he didn't have a gun."
           </p>
           <p>
            From the August 16, 1964 Washington Post, "Two years ago the members of the WCC purchased the Westbriar Club property for $1 million…The other day the value of the property was assessed at $3 million."~~
           </p>
          </blockquote>
          <p>
           So, even wapo seems to think that the WCC(presumably referring to Westwood Country Club in Westwood, Missouri) purchased or had a hand in purchasing and renaming what was once known as Westbriar Country Club. I beg the question again, why is John so mad about Hanssen and why is he 9/11 signalling in his wapo article? I think that there's a connection between the two and that John knows it.

            <strong>
             All of the above considered, I took a look at the Vienna, VA sex-offender's registry - go ahead and do the same:
            </strong>
            <a href="http://www.city-data.com/so/so-Vienna-Virginia.html">
             http://www.city-data.com/so/so-Vienna-Virginia.html
            </a>
           </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
           <em>
            Look for the first case of child-abuse, 2nd entry in the list. (I won't share the direct link, as there's a captcha and disclaimers; DO NOT USE INFO ON THIS SITE TO STALK/HARASS/HARM)
           </em>
          </p>
          <p>
           I think it's possible that the WCC(Vienna, VA) members are somehow related to the still-open case of sexual assault against a minor, that perhaps other Vienna, VA child sex abuse cases may also be related and that Hanssen's activities are also connected to some of this and that again, John Podesta(et al) knows all about it and/or is directly involved.
          </p>
          <p>
           This might explain his deflecting and anger and 9/11 signalling, implying that it's all part of a larger network of child sex abuse and corruption - was 9/11 a punishment for other failings in the network? Was it a distraction from failings in the network? (network of child sex abuse and political corruption, etc).

           <strong>
            Hanssen wiki:
           </strong>
          </p>
          <blockquote>
           <h1>
            Investigation and arrest
           </h1>
           <p>
            ~~During his final days with the FBI, Hanssen began to suspect that something was wrong; in early February 2001 he asked his friend at a computer technology company for a job. He also believed he was hearing noises on his car radio which indicated that it was bugged, although the FBI was later unable to reproduce the noises Hanssen claimed to have heard. In the last letter he wrote to the Russians, which was picked up by the FBI when he was arrested, Hanssen said that he had been promoted to a "do-nothing job ... outside of regular access to information," and that, "Something has aroused the sleeping tiger."[45]
           </p>
           <p>
            However, his suspicions did not stop him from making one more dead drop. After dropping his friend off at the airport on February 18, 2001, Hanssen drove to Virginia's Foxstone Park.He placed a white piece of tape on a park sign, which was a signal to his Russian contacts that there was information at the dead drop site. He then followed his usual routine, taking a package consisting of a sealed garbage bag of classified material and taping it to the bottom side of a wooden footbridge over a creek.~~
           </p>
          </blockquote>
          <p>
           Who was the friend, I wonder... was anything suspicious going on at the computer tech company? Perhaps child-porn related?

            You did hit on an intriguing clue but you don't realize what it is. It is a connector that links things together but you don't understand it. I do understand it. If you were not a treasonous shit head I would tell you what it is. But you are a treasonous shit head so I will not. It is something that is sewn all through the subjects that are discussed in the dark world and it is staring you right in the face. But fuck you I will not point it out to you.

            Wrong shit head. This is not a writing class for you to bring your garbage and hope people are impressed while you struggle with it because it is garbage. You burned your bridges with your interference in the mod changes and you are an outcast from the Village. Accept that you are a treasonous dog and go hang out with your own kind.

             During his tenure as director of the FBI, Louis Freeh presided over a series of blunders and failures that brought the bureau to a low point in its history. From the embarrassment of the Russian mole Robert Hanssen to the bungling of the Wen Ho Lee investigation to the wasting of hundreds of millions of dollars in a failed attempt to build a modern, computerized case management system, the bureau under Freeh's leadership stumbled from one blunder to the next, with little or no accountability. The nadir, as the nation knows too well, was reached in the astonishing string of failures that helped leave America vulnerable to the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001.
            </p>
            <p>
             In the face of this record, Freeh has now published "My FBI," a book distinguished by its shameless buck-passing. Nothing, it seems, was ever Louis Freeh's fault.

               The Board of Trustees commissioned an independent investigation by former FBI director Louis Freeh and his law firm. The Freeh Report stated that Spanier and Paterno, along with Curley and school vice president Gary Schultz, had known about allegations of child abuse on Sandusky's part as early as 1998, and were complicit in failing to disclose them. Freeh found a "total and consistent disregard by the most senior leaders at Penn State for the safety and welfare of Sandusky's child victims", which "empowered" Sandusky to continue his abuse.[8]:14[9][10]

            <strong>
             Article opens:
            </strong>
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             A veteran F.B.I. agent who spied for Moscow for more than two decades has said that security at the bureau was so lax that it amounted to ''criminal negligence'' and that even file clerks had easy access to classified national-security information stored on the bureau's computers, according to a report by a special Justice Department panel that was released today.
            </p>
            <p>
             The confessed spy, Robert P. Hanssen, also told the panel's investigators in a series of interviews that his motivation for spying was money and that he had originally planned to ''get a little money'' from espionage and then ''get out of it.''
            </p>
            <p>
             Instead, Mr. Hanssen, a 57-year-old father of six, remained a spy for 22 years, collecting an estimated $600,000 in cash and gems from the Russians in exchange for American secrets, including the identity of Russian agents working for the United States who were later executed because of Mr. Hanssen's treachery.
            </p>
           </blockquote>
           <p>
            <strong>
             The juicy part:
            </strong>
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             Mr. Hanssen told the investigators that he had little fear that his computer hacking would attract the attention of his superiors, given the lax supervision of the computer system. ''If I had been a more malevolent spy than I was,'' he is quoted as saying, ''they would have had a very difficult time finding me.''
            </p>
            <p>
             The panel's report noted that because there was so little monitoring of intrusions into the computer system, Mr. Hanssen was not detected even when he began running computer searches on files involving Louis J. Freeh, the former F.B.I. director, and President Bill Clinton's family.
            </p>
            <p>
             ''On more than 20 occasions, he ran searches containing the names 'Hillary Rodham Clinton,' 'Hillary,' 'Chelsea' or 'Clinton,' '' the report said. ''He ran at least one search on Director Freeh. Had the F.B.I. been aware of these searches, it seems likely that auditors would have found this activity peculiar.''
            </p>

             Early Life
            </h1>
            <p>
             Hanssen was born in Chicago, Illinois, to a family who lived in the Norwood Park community.[7] His father Howard, a Chicago police officer, was emotionally abusive to Hanssen during his childhood.[8][9] He graduated from William Howard Taft High School in 1962 and went on to attend Knox College in Galesburg, Illinois, where he earned a bachelor's degree in chemistry in 1966.
            </p>
            <p>
             Hanssen applied for a cryptographer position in the National Security Agency, but was rebuffed due to budget setbacks. He enrolled in dental school at Northwestern University[10] but switched his focus to business after three years.[11] Hanssen received an MBA in accounting and information systems in 1971 and took a job with an accounting firm. He quit after one year and joined the Chicago Police Department as an internal affairs investigator, specializing in forensic accounting. In January 1976, he left the police department to join the Federal Bureau of Investigation.[8]

             <strong>
              <em>
               Hanssen met Bernadette "Bonnie" Wauck, a staunch Roman Catholic, while attending dental school at Northwestern. The couple married in 1968, and Hanssen converted from Lutheranism to his wife's Catholicism, becoming a fervent believer and being extensively involved in the conservative Catholic organization Opus Dei.[12]

             Personal life
            </h1>
            <p>
             According to USA Today, those who knew the Hanssens described them as a close family. They attended Mass weekly and were very active in Opus Dei. Hanssen's three sons attended The Heights School in Potomac, Maryland, an all-boys preparatory school.[58] His daughters attended Oakcrest School for Girls in Vienna, Virginia, an independent Roman Catholic school. Both schools are associated with Opus Dei. Hanssen's wife Bonnie still teaches theology at Oakcrest.[59]
            </p>
            <p>
             <strong>
              <em>
               A priest at Oakcrest said that Hanssen had regularly attended a 6:30 a.m. daily mass for more than a decade.[60] Opus Dei member Father C. John McCloskey III said he also occasionally attended the daily noontime mass at the Catholic Information Center in downtown Washington. After going to prison, Hanssen claimed he periodically admitted his espionage to priests in confession. He urged fellow Catholics in the Bureau to attend mass more often and denounced the Russians, even though he was spying for them, as "godless".[61]

             <strong>
              <em>
               However, at Hanssen's suggestion, and without the knowledge of his wife, a friend named Jack Horschauer, a retired Army officer, would sometimes watch the Hanssens having sex through a bedroom window. Hanssen then began to secretly videotape his sexual encounters and shared the videotapes with Horschauer. Later, he hid a video camera in the bedroom that was connected via closed-circuit television line so that his friend could observe the Hanssens from his guest bedroom.[62] He also explicitly described the sexual details of his marriage on Internet chat rooms, giving information sufficient for those who knew them to recognize the couple.[63]
              </em>
             </strong>
            </p>
            <p>
             Hanssen frequently visited D.C. strip clubs, and spent a great deal of time with a Washington stripper named Priscilla Sue Galey. She went with Hanssen on a trip to Hong Kong, and on a visit to the FBI training facility in Quantico, Virginia.[64] He gave her money, jewels, and a used Mercedes-Benz, but cut off contact with her before his arrest, when she fell into drug abuse and prostitution. Galey claims that although she offered to sleep with him, Hanssen declined, saying that he was trying to convert her to Catholicism.[65]

            <p>
             The story is mentioned in Ronald Kessler's book The Secrets of the FBI, both in Chapter 15, "Catching Hanssen," and Chapter 16, "Breach."[citation needed]
            </p>
            <p>
             Eric O'Neill's role in the capture of Robert Hanssen was dramatized in the 2007 film Breach, in which Chris Cooper played the role of Hanssen and Ryan Phillippe played O'Neill.[66]
            </p>
            <p>
             The 2007 documentary Superspy: The Man Who Betrayed the West describes the hunt to trap Robert Hanssen. Hanssen also was the subject of a 2002 made-for-television movie, Master Spy: The Robert Hanssen Story, with the teleplay by Norman Mailer and starring William Hurt as Hanssen. Robert Hanssen's jailers allowed him to watch this movie but Hanssen was so angered by the film that he turned it off.[67]

             <strong>
              <em>
               Hanssen is mentioned in chapter 5 of Dan Brown's book The Da Vinci Code as the most noted Opus Dei member to non-members. Because of his sexual deviancy and espionage conviction, the organization's reputation was badly hurt.[68]

            <p>
             Hanssen's story is reviewed on season 2, episode 4 of Mysteries at the Museum. Actual footage of his arrest by FBI agents is included. His story is the last segment of four included in this episode.
            </p>
            <p>
             The American Court TV (now TruTV) television series Mugshots released an episode on the Robert Hanssen case titled Robert Hanssen - Hanssen and the KGB'.[69]

             The Jesuit priest and writer James Martin wrote that Opus Dei puts great emphasis on recruiting, and pointed to Escriva's writings which say "You must kill yourselves for proselytism."[11] David Clark, a consultant who specialises in helping people leave cults, claimed in 2006 that Opus Dei used a cult-like recruitment technique called "love bombing", in which potential members are showered with flattery and admiration by members of the organization in order to entice them into joining.

           <blockquote>
            <p>
             On 9 January 2006, it came to light that Kelly’s department had granted permission for a man, Paul Reeve, who had been cautioned by police for viewing child pornography images and who was on a sex offenders register, to be employed at a school in Norwich on the basis that he had not been convicted of an offence. He, and an unknown number of others on the sex offenders register, were not on the DfES prohibited list, "List 99".[25] On 13 January, Kim Howells, a Minister of State at the DfES, admitted that it was he who had actually made the decision, in accordance with advice given to him by civil servants that the "person did not represent an ongoing threat to children but that he should be given a grave warning". In response to the critical media coverage surrounding the issue, Downing Street issued a statement confirming their confidence in Kelly and denying rumours that she was to be replaced.[26]
            </p>
            <p>
             There was further controversy when it transpired that another teacher, William Gibson, 59, who had been cleared to work at Portchester School in Bournemouth despite the fact that he had been convicted in 1980 for indecent assault on a 15-year-old girl and had been previously removed from three schools. A letter from the Department for Education that suggested the Secretary of State had considered his case and found that although his past actions had been unwise and unacceptable, he had undertaken teaching work to good effect since.[27]

            <strong>
             Pizzagate premise/theory:
            </strong>
            Q seems to be pointing out Stanislav Lunev and "The BRIDGE" as a reference to Robert Hanssen and the place of his arrest, which is likely due to curiosities surrounding Hanssen and other pizzagate-related persons/elements. My theory is that Robert Hanssen's activities as a spy, may have also included some form of connection to institutionalized child abuse and/or the cover-up thereof, facilitated by Opus Dei, at the behest of Podesta/Clinton et al.
           </p>
           <p>
            The history &amp; founding of Opus Dei is also mired in controversy, including accusations of support for Nazis/Hitler - incidentally, Opus Dei is also known for being opposed to Hitler per their support for Communism. This kind of schismatic support/opposition indicates an underlying agenda to "play both sides", to myself; Links between Opus Dei and Robert Hanssen, seem very deeply rooted in WW2 and Cold War espionage - coupling this with the sex-abusers in schools controversy which has surrounded Opus Dei member &amp; UK politician, Ruth Kelly - it seems even more apparent that ties between Opus Dei &amp; politics touch on corruption, espionage and child abuse.
           </p>
           <p>
            Curiosities pertaining to John Podesta's suspiciously angry article which opens with 9/11 signalling, Foxstone Park and the surrounding area(nearby Westwood Country Club) and 9/11-related incidents/elements also indicate 9/11 as peripheral to Hanssen/CIA/FBI...

                I'm not getting into an argument with you, suffice to say, I think the dots are very much there and connected, far-reaching though it may be.
               </p>
               <p>
                You disagree, that's fine, I'm not gonna continue putting the energy into reposting it.
               </p>
               <p>
                I'm not trying to subvert the purpose of the 24hr flair, the point of it is to encourage the author to improve their post and the way in which the present their proposed connections/claims.
               </p>
               <p>
                I'd say this is at least a major improvement on the previous iteration and puts Podesta and WCC and Washington Post and Hanssen/GRU/FBI/CIA/Clinton(all previously established as pg-related(WaPo as deliberate disinfo and supporting 'the elite'), except GRU, Hanssen and WCC) right in the spotlight with plausible connections to Sept 11th 2001, given that Hanssen was arrested in February of that same year... I don't see it as that large of a leap and I think this time I've provided at least 2 solid inter-connecting ways of making the leap work.
               </p>
               <p>
                Again, you disagree, okay.
               </p>
               <p>
                That's all from me.

              I wouldn't put that outside the realm of possibility myself, but, it still begs the question of why choose a name identical to the WCC in Westwood, Missouri?

             <p>
              To be fair, I didn't say(or mean to imply) that it(the place abroad, not the WCC there, yes?) is important in the context of this submission. I do recall it coming up in previous research of mine and I think a few submissions by others in
              <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/v/pizzagate">
               v/pizzagate
              </a>
              ... if there's a relevance here, from Missouri abroad, I'd be interested.

                 Just towns or neighborhoods it's just a popular name. 
I have found other Westwood Country Clubs too.

                 I think you might be someone for whom coincidences seem really important.   It's a common name.

                  Oh righto. Well yes, I do look for that stuff, but if I jumped on every Westwood at once, my own head would start to hurt xD

                  That said, Westwood popping up as towns/neighborhoods
                  <em>
                   and
                  </em>
                  multiple country clubs, makes me wonder. I'd have to go looking at all of them to see if there's anything to the curiosity, not gonna go doing that any time soon lol(if nothing else, getting late on this end).
