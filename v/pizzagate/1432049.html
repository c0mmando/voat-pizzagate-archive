            I'm onto something big there. Walls was acquired by the Lever Brothers in the early part of the last century, before they merged with Dutch counterparts to form Unilever.
           </p>
           <p>
            William Hesketh Lever, 1st Viscount Leverhulme (19 September 1851 â€“ 7 May 1925) was an English industrialist, philanthropist, and politician. But the Hesketh family are best known for their later role in James Hunts' successful Formula One motor racing campaign in the 1970s, where they ran Hunt's team (Hesketh Racing). They also married into the Guinness family at some point.
           </p>
           <p>
            Now, here is something massive. Violet Hesketh, who is around 26 now, was actually found commenting on the Instagram post of ray.chandler (Rachel 'Child' Handler, allegedly for the Clintons, and herself a follower of Comet Pizza). That fact was captured in screen shots in one of the most popular followed YouTube videos...
           </p>
           <p>
            I will post a screenshot here...It's from 56:49 on the video...

            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            Under 'poplinlondon,' Lucy Guinness also comments on the chicken farming picture, covered a minute or so later in the same video.

            Watching 8 hours straight of David Icke on Youtube (one of his all day presentations) was a key factor in my awakening. I have not been the same since. He has been at it for years, before anyone else. To call him disinfo is absurd. Icke goes all the way to the top/bottom of the rabbit hole into the hyperdimensional. For those who think all this stops or begins at earth, it can seem a bit much. But keep going....

            Here is the full interview with this anonym swiss banker:
            <a href="http://www.thetruthseeker.co.uk/?p=27971">
             http://www.thetruthseeker.co.uk/?p=27971
            </a>
            Icke relates to it in 1:16:22.
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             Q: Do you think it is a good thing that people are exposing Bilderberg and showing who they really are?
            </p>
            <p>
             A: I think the Strauss-Kahn case is a good chance for us, because it shows these people are corrupt, sick in their minds, so sick they are full of vices and those vices are kept under wraps on their orders. Some of them like
             <strong>
              Strauss-Kahn rape women, others are sado maso, or pedophile and many are into Satanism
             </strong>
             . When you go in some banks you see these Satanist symbols, like in the Rothschild Bank in Zurich.
             <strong>
              These people are controlled by black-mail because of the weaknesses they have.
             </strong>
             They have to follow orders or they will be exposed, they will be destroyed or even killed. The reputation of Strauss-Kahn is not only killed in the mass media, he could be killed also literally.
            </p>
           </blockquote>
           <p>
            But the whole interview creates a clearer picture on world affairs.

            I'm still watching it now (despite my misgivings, things have gotten so weird I'm willing to put the full time in, despite it sounding like bullshit), I got to about 50 minutes through before making that comment and am now at 1 hr 15 minutes, and he still has not offered a single shred of actual proof. The only concrete strand in there is "Here is how political figures operate, and have operated throughout history, with regards to their character traits and behaviour, and I posit that is due to genetics.".
           </p>
           <p>
            Everything else is speculation, this whole "there are demon archons projecting a false reality at us and that resonates with the powers of these overlords" yadda yadda yadda is
            <em>
             completely
            </em>
            without substantiation.
           </p>
           <p>
            As for this whole pizzagate thing, at the moment we have
            <em>
             an enormous amount
            </em>
            of disturbing and downright weird circumstantial evidence. I don't know what the fuck is going on with it, and yeah, it might turn out to be real, as terrifying as that thought is, but let's not pretend at
            <em>
             this present stage
            </em>
            that we have absolute proof as to the exact nature of what is going on. There is still no
            <em>
             concrete
            </em>
            evidence as of yet.

            I don't understand how someone can claim to be so obsessed with what's true, and prepared to be subject to endless ridicule, so long as they have the truth, and adopt a narrative so utterly devoid of any kind of material proof whatsoever, and claim it to be the truth.

            Now, I don't know a whooooole lot about Icke, but what I do know about him I can say... it isn't good. And he most certainly is not a good figure head for this cause. Anyone who has made the claim that they are Jesus Christ incarnate claiming to know when the world is going to end, gives the date for the end, and then it doesn't happen... yea... pretty much calls everything into question they say.

            This video is interesting for expanding theories, but we got to acknowledge that it's David "they are all lizard people" icke presenting this information.

            We should strive to get this information accepted by mainstream folks, normies if you will.

             Exactly this.  Wish I had enough comment points to upvote.  David Icke is a disinformation agent.  The most effective disinformation tells a basically true overall narrative and mixes in crazy shit like "lizard people." David Icke and Alex Jones are DISINFORMANTS.  DO NOT PROMOTE THEM.  Same goes for FBI psy-op agent Ted Gunderson.

             I'd like to add an addendum to this. When guys like this say "Satanism!!!", look beyond it and understand that people involved in power-cults like this aren't necessarily believers in the supernatural side of things. These weird rituals and immoral practices are a form of hazing and initiation, like you'd see with a fraternity or street gang. These are a mix of test used to demonstrate that the prospective new member of the club will A: follow directions from the elders without question, including subjecting themselves to humiliation, and B: be willing to commit heinous acts in order to show their commitment beyond the law of the land, and their own moral codes.

             The spooky shit is just set dressing to the power construct.

            Many users are correct in thinking Icke's material will be too out there for some, but it is, IMO, largely correct in broad outline at least. I hope the pizzagate revelations will open more people up to the kind of world we're living in but I understand balking at this kind of material if you've been living in a typical materialist ontological mindset for much of your life. Icke spreads a lot of interesting ideas and his notoriety has done a lot for getting this kind of information out but I don't think he's the most eloquent or accurate speaker on the subject. For anyone who's starting to at least take a look at these kinds of ideas I would recommend this series of talks by Mark Passio:
           </p>
           <p>
            <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1V98DsNXi0&amp;t=8s">
             https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1V98DsNXi0&amp;t=8s
            </a>
            (first part of a three part talk, the other parts should be easy to find in the "related videos")
           </p>
           <p>
            It starts out really slow and may be tedious at first for anyone who has a basic background in philosophy but once it gets going it's incredibly valuable. He goes through a basic primer on the symbolism of every major Western occult system. In the third part he ends with a rundown of incredibly blatant use of this symbolism in US government and military patches, logos, architecture, etc. (Here's that part if you just want to see some of that first:
            <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C6E6abDdBII">
             https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C6E6abDdBII
            </a>
            )
           </p>
           <p>
            Once you've gone through the talks (they're long, I know, it's worth it if you're interested though, trust me. You could spend a thousand hours watching random "illuminati" stuff on youtube and reading convoluted ersatz mystical texts trying to learn what Passio lays out in a few hours in these talks.), I would highly recommend you check out this site:
            <a href="http://montalk.net/">
             http://montalk.net/
            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            IMO, Montalk is the best site on the internet dealing with these topics and providing some kind of overarching theory of what's going on (the meat of the big picture is in the "gnosis" section, but just go to the main page, read the main intro, and it will tell you how to start getting into the material on the site. From there you can pick which sections interest you most to start reading there first.)
           </p>
           <p>
            A lot of people will laugh at this material and dismiss it and that's fine. But even if your world view prevents you from taking a lot of these ideas seriously, at least taking the time to learn some of the symbolism laid out in the Passio talks will allow you to parse a new layer of what's happening in the world around you. You may not be able to believe in "magic", "spirits", aliens, or whatever else, but the ruling class does, or at least they engage in activities designed to interact with these dimensions of life, whether they're real or not, and knowing the symbolism involved in these areas can help you see what's happening even if only on a completely mundane material level.

            Satanist here. Most allegations connecting Satanism with pedophilia are simply attempts to revive the satanic panic back from the 80's. If you're not familiar, go watch Witch Hunt narrated by Sean Penn, it's good. Most of the "ritual abuse" cases and convictions in the U.S. have been proven false. There are satanists in this world, there are pedophilles. I have no doubt there may even be a small handful of Satanic pedophilles, but there are pedos in every religious community. I don't walk around thinking every Catholic priest has a religious imperative to molest choir boys. Hell, I think there's something fishy about Pizzagate, and I encourage you all to keep digging, but don't go after some whackjobs folly of believing we're some powerful ever present organization that gets off on kids, that's really not our modus operandi. Voat Goats are smarter than that.

             The "satanic panic" is a propaganda term designed to make a mockery of the last time the pedophillic elite were almost uncovered in the 80's. Cases of ritual abuse were covered up and dismissed by the system because, as people are finally realizing because of pizzagate, these crimes were being done by the people who run the system.
            </p>
            <p>
             The "satanism" you practice is just the bottom PR rung of a much darker complex. Just as there are thousands upon thousands of Free Masons who are completely normal people who think the organization they're involved in is basically just a men's drinking club, OTO members, kabbalists, Rosicrusians, Thelemites, etc., who think they're just learning about an interesting symbol system or at the most, dabbling in some innocent spell craft that might allow them to bend probabilities in their favor, satanism, through the Laveyan church and other "gee wiz Satanism is just edgy humanism" organizations, is just a friendly face and a recruiting and vetting tool for much darker layers not open to the majority of regular members.
            </p>
            <p>
             What is certain is that the ruling class has engaged in ritualized pedophilia and sacrifice for thousands of years and the belief system under which they do this is organized around mythological figures historically associated with the convoluted term "Satan". Whether your brand of edgy teen age Satanism has anything to do with these activities has no bearing on the fact that the belief system practiced by the ruling class does. No one is attacking your teen age rebellion club. We are accurately describing the activities of the ruling class in the clearest possible language.

              There's nothing in the satanic cannon I've read that supports pedophilia or sacrificing children, but hey whatever makes you guys wanna dig up dirt on the elites is fine by me. Go for it buddy, because I do suspect that there's a pedophilia ring in the upper echelons of society. I hope you all expose it fully, I really do. Is there a chance they may be occultists as well? Eh, rich people are into some wacky shit, so possibly. Are Satanists all acting in concert to manipulate the world? My deck of tarot cards, magic 8 ball, and reasoning skills say most likely not. But hey, shine on you crazy diamond, prove it definitively.

            Honest question, is there anything we should know about David Icke? You look like a reputable user, so I'm curious to get your opinion.

            ANYONE interested in "Pizzagate" (that has done some research already into it) needs to watch this. A presentation done by David Icke in the UK in front of THOUSANDS in 2012! He has known about all this for many years! Again, please research all the info you can on Pizzagate and when you are at the point where you know its true, please watch and give this video a chance when you have the time.
           </p>

            I have been digging into Pizzagate for a few days now, and this is a look into another layer of all this most people here are still missing. This presentation while some things may be incorrect, largely exposes this international Satanic network, so please give it a chance and a watch when you have time. It is time for all of us to wake up. When we do, the great battle between good and evil is going to take place as prophecized, and we will eventually all be FREE from Satan in a new reality/world I believe. It is time to wake up and take back our world before these psychopaths destroy it.

            **Edit  -   I know Icke is viewed as controversial regarding Reptilians and is "out there" but the guy has been studying this stuff for 20+ years (compared to a few days to a few weeks for most of us) so at least give him SOME credit. I doubt he is 100% correct about everything, and has gotten some stuff wrong, but this covers A LOT of interesting points to look at regarding the Elite and Satanism/Pedophilia, and called it WAY before most people. Reptilians if real are simply the demonic entities that invade into humans making them "feelingless" cold psychopaths. Most belief systems in the world have expressed and believe demons and possession exists. He says Reptilians don't exist physically here, but they are like computer viruses, they need a host to infect and operate, otherwise they can't manipulate our physical dimension and we can't see them in our visible light spectrum. They are simply using these royal bloodline and elitist "puppets" to hijack our reality and usher in their evil agenda.
