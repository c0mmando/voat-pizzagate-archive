            The jewish meme was what set them off.
           </p>
           <p>
            They are being sued for discrimination, and have done an excellent job at suppressing news on the lawsuit. The jewish meme hit home because it pointed out that they do not advance black people, only jews.
           </p>
           <p>
            The moment that gets out, CNN and the people they cover for will be in a lot of trouble. So that is why they where freaking out over that meme.

            This isn't the first time CNN has doxxed people for making fun of them.

            Donnie O'Sulivan's done it too. Time for him to start getting the skeletons in his closet dragged out.

             They are saying that Twitter is on Fire Right Now.  They also said we should burn them down (figuratively of course).  Here is a new Acronym I will be using that I saw on there as well.   CRIMINAL NEWS NETWORK   It does not get better than that.

            Foxnews and cnn scandalized,  self sabotaging and sewing doubt the same year as "fake news" meme gets foisted on us by the president? Hmmm...
           </p>
           <p>
            I believe were being played. We cant trust the politicians and now increasingly every media outlet thats supposed to keep tyem in check.  Were ready to tear the system down with no exit plan or vision for the future? Sure about that? You're playing right into the nwos plans

            A fucking 15 year old? You guys are going about this all wrong - keep spinning your wheels trying to dig up dirt on ACPooper or anyone of the aforementioned names. They are lawyered and layered and protected.
           </p>
           <p>
            Hit the soft underbelly. Find the semi no names at upper mid level. There are a lot more of them and the only way to rise in the ranks is by joining the club. It is their social media presence and connections which you want to apply to.
           </p>
           <p>
            They will freak the fuck out when pictures from social media ties them to pedo shit. Source our leads from LinkedIn to start.

             Yep. He the biggie. 
Everyone should know the Jews run the media, that's no secret everybody knows. But we do need to be careful of is not automatically assuming they're all supportive of pedophilia. That is not the point it's the system of media, which just happens to be consolidated among the few Jewish power players, is covering it up. So go after their complete lack of journalistic integrity.  Hasn't it been assumed for a long time that Anderson Cooper is a CIA asset/plant? Former directors of the CIA have said they have plants in all the media outlets. For decades.

            Assange has spoken. 2nd degree coercion. Apparently, the target was 15 years old. That makes him a minor.
           </p>
           <p>
            New potential targets to track: Time Warner and AT&amp;T
           </p>
           <p>
            Time Warner are the owners of CNN. Connections to Ted Turner. AT&amp;T is going to merge with Time Warner.
           </p>
           <p>
            This means that the higher ups of both groups are now valid targets to sink our teeth into.

            More on Anderson Cooper:  Check out the satanic-looking artwork hanging above this bed in his childhood home where he posed for a photo with his mom, Gloria Vanderbilt, and his brother (who as a young man jumped off a balcony to his death right in front of his mother, according to his mother):

            Notice in this closeup the witchy person presiding over some kind of ceremony and a box with spikes and a naked person inside, the severed head to the left, and spikes everywhere around the collage.  Sleep tight!:

             That's reminiscent of dark freemason tracing boards.
            </p>
            <p>
             Edit: correction: that's got some freemason tracing board symbolism in it, but it's an image of two children, depicted as angels, sacrificing another child, with a satanic priest overlooking and guiding the sacrifice.
            </p>
            <p>
             No doubt, this is a generational satanic ritual cult family. This explains the suicide of the family member.

              Very interesting.  I had never heard of tracing boards as masonic teaching tools:
              <a href="http://masonictracingboards.com/">
               http://masonictracingboards.com/

             </p>
             <p>
              Agree with your assessment of the likely nature of this family.  The Hollywood satanic cesspool also plays a big part in Gloria Vanderbilt's life story:

               Freemason tracing boards, like Tarot cards, the Sefirot, Chakra symbols, etc., are teaching tools for the mystery traditions. The first level tracing board alone has dozens or more symbolic meanings within it. For example, the pillars of enlightenment, which are featured in Vanderbilt's wall hanging, symbolize the sacred masculine and sacred feminine energies, depicted by the sun on the left, and the moon on the right. Those pillars are on practically every freemason temple on the planet. The pillars have numerous meanings, but the aforementioned are the basic principles. Every symbol has a meaning, but I only know some of those found in this piece.
              </p>
              <p>
               The children are represented by angels, because they are innocent. And they are being instructed to sacrifice the victim, which is how generational satanic ritual abuse is passed on. They force the child-victim to murder another victim, in order to possess or own them for life. I'm not sure if these sacrifices are depicted in other freemason tracing boards, I have not studied them exhaustively.

            I'm genuinely appalled at CNN for this behaviour, a powerful organisation threatening to doxx a private citizen over a harmless meme, a disgusting abuse of power. And there's talk that Reddit provided them with info, which would come as no surprise to anyone from the old PG subreddit. Glad to see Wikileaks calling them out on this:

              Wow. This is VERY encouraging.   If why I, the progressives have been organizing many corporate owned media specifically CNN protests for several years now. Time to get everybody else on board!!

               Please do not call those people Progressives.  They are all wearing Sheep Costumes.  Shumer, Shiff,  and Co.  like to lie about being Progressive, just like Hillary did.  She adopted all of Bernie's Platform on the road as if they were her own.  NOT.  They are Globalist Pedo Elites just like Bush Ryan Priebus, and their lot, who are also not True Conservatives.  Both sides have hijacked their parties. They are all a bunch of Lying Sacks.

            There is a ton of dirt on CNN, it's been out there for decades.  Faking the news, dirt on founder Turner, etc. CNN was begun with DoD seed money.  THEIR ROLE IS TO PROMOTE WAR SO OF COURSE THEY DISSEMINATE DISINFO/PROPAGANDA.
