<p>So I can\'t collaborate with people who are doing similar research to me. I am doing research behind the scenes, but I don\'t post submissions about it to collect voats unless I have something new to say, or to ask a question if I\'ve hit a brick wall. </p>
<p>It looks like shills will band together and target someone who they\'re not happy with, and downvoat them into oblivion. </p>
<p>Instead of making new accounts which are easy to spot (especially if they are called AnyBot5 etc, lol), it looks like the new tactic is to grab any old news article or video link from the net about pedophilia,  post it without any comment as to how it furthers the investigation into pizzagate, and clog up the boards in this way. </p>
<p>That means you and I have to plough through a 50 minute YouTube video of something completely unrelated to pizzagate. </p>
<p>They get a couple of upvoats every time, which could mean they get enough voats to downvoat your legit post out of the water and make YOU look like a shill.</p>
<p>What can you do? </p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Use your downvoats and comments to help the mods identify a Lazy Link Shitpost</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ping us if you think you\'ve identified a repeat offender or if it looks like the shills are downvoating your historical contributions too. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you\'re posting a link, please try to explain in your comments why it is worth a watch and why you think it helps further the investigation. Your title should describe what I am about to view. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Post your blinding new information on a Sunday. Looks like Hills don\'t pay double time, I didn\'t see many around last week. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you spot a new tactic, let us know. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you have any questions about a moderation decision please message us or ping us if you don\'t have messaging ability. There are new mods here because they are sorely needed, and we might make mistakes occasionally (I hold my hands up, I am new, the other mods were quick to put me right, they are good folks). We want to be transparent and to uphold the aims of Voat, no censorship. This is hard when we have shills spreading disinformation and posting unrelated news. I spend about 12 hours a day on Voat, trying to read everything and flair things I think are brilliant. If you think something should be flaired because it\'s epic, ping us, just use <a href="https://voat.co/user/AnyFucker">@AnyFucker</a> to do this, or <a href="https://voat.co/user/themoderatorofyourch">@themoderatorofyourch</a>oice.  The list of mods is in the sidebar to the right, as are moderating decisions (deleted posts etc) </p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>What I can do</p>
<p>I can still delete posts for rule violations. I can still post submissions.</p>',

            I'm new here and just getting to understand the voting system. Didn't use reddit all that much before. So is this why I had -24 one day after I signed up and said "I concur" to someone once?  Spent  a week getting back to 0.  If this is what shills do then it's obvious the down vote feature can be exploited.  Why is there a down vote option?  imo, if a post or thread is good enough, up voting will rank it were it's supposed to be. No need to down vote.

            that's right.  I have never been against free speech, only that which might be used to say the pizzagate investigation is a nest of _____ that promotes violence against _____.   Anyway, it doestn't seem to be a big issue in the media anyway at this point so let's drop it.  Voat very well just may not be the forum for me. which is fine.  I'm going to give it a few days and see if I feel like contributing later.   And try to lighten up once in awhile, kay?  good for your ,mental health.

            Ridiculous.  I talk to your ass more than anyone on here.  And that's going to stop.  I am requesting that you stop harrassing me okay?  I am not powerful, I mean nothing, I am not important and certainly not worth your time.  And if I have an opinion about you or your fag buddy, I'm going to say it wherever I wish and you are going to LOVE it because you are ALL ABOUT FREE SPEECH.  Agreed? Yes.  Good.

            Thanks for bringing this to light.  I posted this under the sticky but I want to know what you think as well:
           </p>
           <p>
            "...points - they seem to swing wildly. Because of these manipulations I lost all interest in the points per se - they are clearly worthless and subject to mod or other manipulator's temper tantrums. They are also used to "silence" ironically by some who consider themselves big crusaders for free speech here - Crensch and KevDude waged an unreasonable campaign on me because I repeated what mods told us all - call out shills on bigotry, hate speech, violence promotion etc in a post that brought in hundreds of new subscribers who, as idealists thought pretty much the same way. Next couple of days the forum views seemed to be on some sort of lock down and now this. Meanwhile the race baiting bots were discovered. So there's some history of the past couple of days and I'd like to hear others bout what they've witnessed.
           </p>
           <p>
            I had around 400 comment points about 4 days ago, then overnight while defending myself against "unpresidented" sub deletions with Crensch/KevDud (the liars cited rule 3 when there were three links as just one example) it was at -15, then plummeted to -60s, that day they swung in a few minutes up to +11 then back down to the -60s, now overnight I somehow gained points back to +2.
           </p>
           <p>
            WTF?, but also ::yaown:: clearly this isn't a stable long term forum.
           </p>
           <p>
            Seems like a kind of programmed bot down voting. Obviously the forum is ridiculously manipulated and is not reliable. I join others suggesting a migration asap. Upvote if you like but don't hold your points too dearly, they are just a method of control over you. (a fairly lame one, but nonetheless the intent is there). No doubt my points are going to plummet again after this post.
           </p>
           <p>
            Addendum to that post:   My argument is that pizzagte forum on voat, and only pizzagate forum, cannot by defniition be a total free speech zone for reasons most reasonable folks understand 1) hate speech here will be used by the media to wipe away any of the good work done. 2) it is subject to an unusual amount of public scrutiny.
           </p>
           <p>
            You are new so I am going to say this - not all the mods are pizzagate friendly.  We know CTR is targeting pizzagate here, most likely they have infiltrated the mods.  Also elsewhere on voat there is active pizzagate dislike as new "interlopers".  Finally mods do run their own agendas, I can say that Crensch in particulare has some really pointed racially biased sumbissions in his voat history and apparently is "afraid" that if we delete bigotry on
            <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/v/pizzagate">
             /v/pizzagate
            </a>
            the practice will "creep" out to other forums on voat.  This is a stupid fear because obviously a clear policy can be made and contained on one forum, but he has expressed it along with his buddy KevDude.   They argue that they are free speech crusaders a la the ACLU, but really for Crensch it's just about being racist anywhere and everywhere even if it is against the wider interests of the specific subverse. If someone wanted to start a
            <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/v/jewsaren">
             /v/jewsaren
            </a>
            'talwaysfat subverse, Crensch would demand have the freedom to post anti-semitic droolings on it if he pleased.
           </p>
           <p>
            I want to propose a rule here that ONLY on the
            <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/v/pizzagate">
             /v/pizzagate
            </a>
            forum, hate speech, bigotry, violence and vigilante justice comments and submissions are grounds for immediate deletion.  I ask you to bring up this rule request in the next mod meeting.  If someone wants to fight me or ban or censor me because of this kind of strategic thinking on behalf of the
            <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/v/pizzagate">

              I never acted unreasonably.  Unfair and obscene downvoating here, I was accused of all kinds of bs that was ridiculous, I had posts removed for rules I did NOT violate, and my greatest sin was bringing in hundreds of subscribers who happened to feel positive the way I did against hate speech.  Meanwhile you've got bots running wild.   Even KevDude says the downvoting was something he didn't agree with.  I'm sure you guys work hard and do you best, but this place feels like a bus of wild animals (pizzagate topic itself) caught up in a cyclone of poindexter anarchists (Voat regulars) under a tsunami of mind-blown acid trippers on gov payroll (CTR of course).   Just my humble and quite unimportant opinion of course.
             </p>
             <p>
              Anyway the rules are established more clearly now and you are pretty much chasing me for my opinions.  Why even bother I wonder? I don't have evidence on the mods, I was taking in all the various monkey business that goes on at this site just like everyone else is and that was one logical explanation.  If you think your mods are above taking CTR money...well you've got a choir of angels working for you I guess.

            So when they downvoat you below zero, and you are unable to comment, how can you ever get enough comment points to ever comment again? Do the downvoats eventually go away or do people have to upvoat your old comments?

            This whole thread illustrates the problem with this message board. And several folks have pointed it out in this thread, that the voating system is inherently flawed and too easily gamed; it keeps the regular user at the bottom.
           </p>
           <p>
            Look at the comments in this thread (or any thread for that matter). The folks talking about random bullshit get positive scores, they don't contribute to the discussion at all. But dare talk about how problematic this system is and how it's rigged against the average user and you get neutral or negative scores... or flagged... or labelled a CTR shill in one line, with no examination.
           </p>
           <p>
            I see several comments in this thread alone, highlighting the flaws, all with enough downvotes to keep them just under the radar. It seems criticizing the system is a big no-no... it's just another form of censorship.
           </p>
           <p>
            And then we don't engage in discussion. This isn't a pro-investigation sub anymore, it's a fucking shillhunt. Everyone always talks about how compromised the sub is but we keep pretending that this is the best option. It's not. It's inundated with bullshit and sifting through the disinfo is getting harder and harder every day.
           </p>
           <p>
            But I guess my "heavy caution" about

            Hi there Pizzagate. I am having a similar problem. I created a dozen videos. 9 of which I uploaded this morning. Here is the link I left this morning, 0 votes this got. I realize that I did not explain the video so it is partially my own fault. But here are my findings: Pizza is a symbol of the rosicruceans. The pepperoni is the rose. I have found so much cultural evidence that was before not understood. Listen, Picasso, Chagall, Gertrude Stein, Faulkner, James Joyce, Ayn Rand, Joan Baez, Allan Ginsberg, William Blake, YB Yeats, Children of the Corn, American Beauty, the "De-Parted", Star Wars, they are all tied in to this phenomenon. Are you listening ? Pizzagate is about the rosicruceans. The brothers of the rosy cross practice satanism and caniballism. The movies by themselves reveal this to be true.  I am no professional movie maker, however in order to make the case that I saw, I learned, and have documented this in my series, "the Rosetta Files". I didn't even know it then, but I was decoding the works of George Lucas in this regard several years ago and subsequently published Cipher Dios, a gnostic interpretation of Star Wars. Believe me, what I have recorded, if you are patient, you will see, pizzagate can be seen 500 years ago in the Last Supper. I show this in episode 2. Here is the link to the very first video:
            <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UduJTlYSnEE&amp;feature=youtu.be">
             https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UduJTlYSnEE&amp;feature=youtu.be
            </a>
            It is a different class of evidence, but our artists have been telling us about pizzagate for hundreds of years.

             Sounds wacky to me, but I'll try to make time to check out your vid.  Assuming you're sincere, "I feel your pain" because I've posted new "discuss" topics several times and typically I get less than 10 replies.  The one that got dozens (and lots of upvoats) was one I posted as a request for someone ELSE to make a sticky.  People liked the suggestion and just upvoated my posting rather than anybody fulfilling my request.  Whatever... LOL!  So, my only great success here was accidental, and all my intentional efforts at content contribution have produced scant results.
            </p>
            <p>
             TL;DR: hang in there.
            </p>
            <p>
             P.S. I just tried to pull up your vid but it requires me to sign in, and I don't do Google accounts of any kind.

            I have a note on a tactic I have to assume they are using that I think we should stay aware of. It's easy to assume someone who writes a lame post that somehow gets endless upvoats is a shill. They may very well be, but I think it's important to remember that CTR could have criteria to determine which posts might benefit them to promote and upvoat into oblivion, thereby pushing weak posts up without having to always write them themselves. This would also minimize the appearance of being exclusively brand new accounts pushing these weak or distracting connections.

            Let's be honest about who's attention we have grabbed. CTR is a superpac. That means they have millions to spend on this.
            <a href="https://www.opensecrets.org/pacs/lookup2.php?strID=C00578997">
             https://www.opensecrets.org/pacs/lookup2.php?strID=C00578997
            </a>
            . If we could get our own super PAC interested in this to counter ctr, that would be great. Here is a list of all of them and who they support
            <a href="https://www.opensecrets.org/pacs/superpacs.php">
             https://www.opensecrets.org/pacs/superpacs.php
            </a>
            . Another thing to note is that they have to make a report every month to the Feds. CTR has not released theirs yet this month.

            I really hate that it comes to this. The Voat system really isn't that great for this sort of discussion IMO but what can you do. It would be fine if we could get rid of the shills 😥

            It used to be that we could do this in reverse.  Ironically a protection put in made this impossible.  Don't worry, once your account has aged some it is invincible.
           </p>
           <p>
            We used to identify the shills and downvote them en masse till their ability to shill was reduced.  They could still voice their opinion so they themselves weren't censored.
           </p>
           <p>
            Now what they do is get upvotes on upvote farm subs (why a lot of us odd guys don't really like you doing it) then age the account.  It then can never be taken back to the stone-age when we identify a real problem.
           </p>
           <p>
            All they have to do is earn less SCP and CCP recently than in the past and there are no downvotes that could effect their score.

            I noticed this since
            <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/sandersforpresident">
             r/sandersforpresident
            </a>
            and now especially on
            <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/politics">
             r/politics
            </a>
            . Not only would I come on and be mass downvoted but they all seemed to hit up my recent history too. Also if you want to find people who don't know they are shadow banned try posting an article that isn't Hillary friendly even if the post doesn't show up in (other submissions) as being posted there and you will get brought to their post that is either mass downvoted till invisible or never seen because they are shadowbanned and their account is not found so you can't let them know or anything. Like this one it brought me to to show it was posted and so far I get responses so they haven't got me yet

            <strong>
             stupid
            </strong>
            point system, upvoting valid posts and downvoting the BS would happen more logically. IMO, the bigger problem exists in the fact that the seemingly-typical stuck-up-their-ass Voat-user never wanted Pizzagaters here...and while the Voat admin and mods, as a whole may not mind, they have limited control...free speech is free speech...even for assholes.

              If that's true then this site is a joke since a single shill can, with his 100 accounts, massively upvote pointless or misleading threads and downvote interesting ones, so he basically decides what most users will or will not see, and there's nothing admins can do about it. It's not like it can stop us to investigate anything and post about it either, but that's still pretty lame.
