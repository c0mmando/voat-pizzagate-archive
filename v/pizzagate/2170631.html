<p>Series Description:</p>
<p>Part reality show, part documentary. Real life X-files meets Da Vinci Code meets Pizzagate. If anyone has better filmmaking skills or equipment than I do, please feel free to contact me about producing a more professional documentary or reality show.</p>
<p>This series chronicles,” Life in the Shadow of Mt.

We will also look at my genetic relationship to Barak Obama and (my husband\'s family\'s relationship to Obama) and why I believe that John Podesta\'s daughter, Megan Rouse, is living in the city next door to where I grew up, and why John Podesta actively campaigned for his daughter\'s election to the school board there, and how John Podesta\'s interest in &quot;Disclosure&quot; has everything to do with what\'s been going on in S.F.\'s &quot;Beast Bay&quot; for a long time.</p>
<p>I grew up with a front row seat to some important history and feel an obligation to share what I have witnessed. I was an actress in films and have crossed paths with celebrities and historical figures. I even saw Green Day’s first show.</p>
<p>Upcoming episodes will include:</p>
<p>The &quot;super complex&quot; surrounding the base of Mt. Diablo: Is there a deep underground military / or &quot;power structure&quot; base inside of / or underneath Mt. Diablo?</p>
<p>Giant bones found in S.F.’s East Bay</p>
<p>Why did Aleister Crowley’s successor move to Dublin, California?</p>
<p>The Bomb before the Bomb: Lawrence Livermore Lab and the Port Chicago Disaster - The first nuclear explosion was not in Trinity, New Mexico but in the S.F. Bay Area, exactly one year and one day before the official blast; (and the occult agenda underlying nuclear technology).</p>
<p>Growing up in a &quot;Paperclip community&quot; (as in Operation Paperclip); &quot;security clearance culture&quot; and &quot;club culture&quot; (as in San Francisco\'s Bohemian Club). Mt. Diablo and the &quot; Hidden Grove&quot; behind Bohemian Grove.</p>

            Amazing synopsis if that is possible. Your willingness to tell your story remarkable. I have information that could add very solid proof of Barack Obama's actual hidden DNA involving eugenics. The identity of his real mother and father.

            If you come from a multi-generational ritual abuse family you could have been a target. Based on a Monarch Butterfly's ability to return to it's birth to die denotes the fact that it automatically knows where it was born at birth. Occultists noticed this and determined that the information was passed on through genetics.
           </p>
           <hr/>
           <p>
            Monarch programmers like to work with multi-generational people because they believe the ability to dissociate is passed on genetically.
