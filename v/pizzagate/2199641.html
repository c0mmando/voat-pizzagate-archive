<p>Indie Wire Article:</p>
<p>The State Department has received another 2,800 Hillary Clinton emails found on the laptop of Anthony Weiner, the estranged husband of top Clinton aide Huma Abedin.</p>
<p>The FBI turned over the documents after Judicial Watch sued the State Department for failing to respond to a Freedom of Information Act request.</p>
<p>&quot;This is a disturbing development,&quot; Judicial Watch President Tom Fitton said in a press release Tuesday, which is pushing for the public release of the emails. &quot;Our experience with Abedin\'s emails suggest these Weiner laptop documents will include classified and other sensitive materials.&quot;</p>
<p>The watchdog group asked for &quot;All emails of official State Department business received or sent by former Deputy Chief of Staff Huma Abedin from January 1, 2009 through February 1, 2013,&quot; using a non-\'state.gov\' email address, the Daily Mail reports.</p>
<p>But their public release will take a while.</p>
<p>In a joint status report signed off by Judicial Watch and the State Department, and dated last week, the State Department names the number of documents found on Weiner\'s computer – 2,800 – and says it plans to have it review of those documents completed by December 31, 2017.</p>
<p>&quot;Based on a preliminary review, the State Department expects that a significant portion of these documents may be duplicative of material already reviewed and processed,&quot; the court document reads.</p>
<p>Fitton thinks both Clinton and Abedin committed crimes. Clinton was secretary of state and Abedin served as Clinton\'s deputy chief of staff, both while using a private email server to conduct government business. Clinton destroyed tens of thousands of emails and smashed the hard drives.</p>
<p>&quot;When will the Justice Department do a serious investigation of Hillary Clinton\'s and Huma Abedin\'s obvious violations of law?&quot; Fitton said.</p>
<p>Last month, Weiner was sentenced to 21 months in prison for a sex case involving a 15-year-old girl. On the day Weiner pleaded guilty, Abedin announced the couple was separating.</p>',

              Hey it's ok, we have all done it. I really would love full access to that laptop though, I think in the end they will butcher the information and just feed us more lies to cover their own skin. It's a sorry state of affairs relating him and his family.

               Seriously. And do you remember hearing about two NYPD Officer's who were shot and killed around the time that laptop was recovered? The coincidence surrounding that was too much to be a coincidence.

                Indeed I did, so much needs to be brought to the light. But somehow I don't think the break will come from his laptop.

                We will see how this all breaks eventually and in the meantime remain vigilant.
