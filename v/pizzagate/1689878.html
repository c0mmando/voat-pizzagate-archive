            Appreciate your efforts but yeah, we figured this one out months ago. In fact, I named both guys, Ian Pope and Luke Hammock, over three months ago.

             Thank you for that tread, it was very informative, however, I didn't find the evidence to support the fact that these are their real identities. 5 other users and I are currently working on Consolidation Thread project and if we don't have anything to support the fact that those are their real names, we can't post it. I know now that they are Washington Players for sure, but I can't find the evidence to support their identities as far as their names go. The search for Ian Pope gave me a UK rugby player, so I didn't post anything yet. If you can link me to that evidence, I'd be more than happy to include it with the rest of the material gathered so far :)

               Just went through their names and checked them one by one. I can't find any of the 2. Too bad. Either it's not them or their accounts are now set to private and they don't show up on the FB search page.

                I can only tell you what I found. If their Facebook's have now been made private or deleted, it's because of what we found long ago. I wouldn't discourage any form of investigation regarding Pizzagate, and by all means continue if you wish, but you will find those names in the end.

            Didn't look into the Rugby players yet, but in the past did look into this pic. The place it was at was "L'enfant Cafe and Bar" it's located in DC. Ironically L'enfant is child or children in french.

            It is based on the history/lore of "Pierre L'enfant" he was a Mason and Friend of George Washington.....also the original designer of DC the city itself. He was replaced due to his differing opinion on where certain monuments should be placed with George Washington.

             Would be crazy if "James Alefantis" was "James L'enfant" and had direct ties to the mason family that designed DC.

            Not to downlplay your efforts...nice work. But I believe this was figured out pretty quickly once someone found the Washington Irish pics months ago (I'm pretty sure I saw that in mid-December). Not trying to bust balls but it's a bummer to see ppl putting honest/good effort into what amounts to re-work.

            Yeah i'm pretty glad that when i originally posted the pic on my FB to promote this to my friends and family- I was sure to state that i wasn't certain because although they look the same, there is no clear physical identifier that settles it for me that it was Quinn. But i think the creepy guys in their shorts, the comments like "you know", and the evil looking guy with his i love kids shirt along with their connection to alefantis/podesta/clinton was enough to get my friends and family posting angry and shocked emojis on my post even without the quinn pedo articles. Pretty clear these are creepy people

                 Nope. I don't even know their names. The pictures don't have tags, so there's no way for me to identify them by name through this website. But it would be interesting to find out more about them, that's for sure.

                   That's just someone's opinion again i googled Ian Pope and came up empty for Washington Irish, except there's a UK rugby player with that name.

                  If you really want to find out, throw an Anon up on FairfaxUnderground.com and some of the other local message board sites. Someone will know them.  Don't spin it with Pizzagate.  Say he screwed your boyfriend or something salacious.
