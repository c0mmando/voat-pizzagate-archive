            <p>
             Standing at the corner of a slightly scruffy south London park, the Cabinet gallery cuts quite a profile. It is a mini-art tower on the site of what was in its 18th-century heyday a lavish, high-tech and romantic pleasure garden and, arguably, the site of Britain’s first public art gallery.
            </p>
            <pre><code>Cabinet was for the past 20 years run from various London sites before gallery directors Martin McGeown and Andrew Wheatley, together with Charles Asprey, scion of the Bond Street jewellers, commissioned Trevor Horne Architects to create a new base. Its launch exhibition, a one-man show of the gallery’s longstanding artist Jim Nutt, opened on Friday.
</code></pre>
            <p>
             For believers in psychogeography, this might be an ideal spot for the new venture. The idea that the weight of the past might influence the way the present unfolds seems to manifest itself here. A garden of earthly delights was replaced by Victorian terraces, which were then condemned as a slum and the land returned to parkland before its current revival.
            </p>
            <p>
             For two centuries from 1660 to 1859, Vauxhall Gardens, on the south bank of the Thames, was the capital’s pleasure machine. It was the birthplace of mass entertainment and catering; it housed the city’s first purpose-built pavilion for the performance of music.
            </p>
            <p>
             For the spectacles staged here, artists painted huge canvases, part-theatrical backdrop, part-public display, of battles or romantic scenes, moralising tableaux as mise-en-scène for the “supper-boxes” which were often themselves the settings for less moral scenes.
            </p>
            <pre><code>Spring Gardens, as the four-acre site was also known, was a landscape of leisure where courtiers, courtesans, carters and carousers mingled. James Boswell, in his 1791 Life of Samuel Johnson, described it like this: “Vauxhall Gardens is peculiarly adapted to the taste of the English nation; there being a mixture of curious show — gay exhibition, musick, vocal and instrumental . . . for all of which only a shilling is paid; and . . . good eating and drinking for those who choose to purchase that regale.”
</code></pre>
            <p>
             ...The gallery is a surprising, 12-sided block of brick which mixes the material language of the railway arches, postwar council estates and industrial archaeology which define the streets of Vauxhall to create a playful memory of the architecture of entertainment.
            </p>
            <pre><code>Its multi-faceted form is intended to evoke the polygonal gothic-style “orchestra”, the elaborate bandstand that once stood at the centre of the gardens. But its complex, irregular form is also a clear response to the dominance of the “white cube” (christened by Brian O’Doherty). This near-inevitable minimalist container for modern art has seen something like an abdication of architecture from art, an admission of defeat for design in the face of the inevitability of a globalised neutral language.

But this is an attempt to create something more unexpected and complex. It is also part of a conscious effort to reinvigorate the edge of the park as a place of culture and entertainment. It joins an ecosystem of galleries that includes Damien Hirst’s Newport Street Gallery (in another superb brick building).
</code></pre>
            <p>
             Asprey, McGeown and Wheatley chose in Trevor Horne Architects a relatively quiet practice (both aesthetically and in terms of presence) but one that has made a significant impact on the London art scene. Horne’s contributions have included Victoria Miro’s impressive east London gallery, the very fine ICA space and a studio for Michael Craig-Martin.

             Our very own Dr Kevin Hogan delivers a presentation at Newspeak House on our recent research working with colleagues at West Virginia University in the US on a project to understand the evolution of the Alt_Right as a digital propaganda phenomenon. He describes the early data from research based on interviews with the members of the Alt_Right community, quantitative studies of their activities on the The_Donald and some thoughts on the future of bots in politics.

            Q has never mentioned adrenochrome, gamepwn. I know, because I have followed Q from the beginning and have repeatedly tried to educate people on the sketchiness of this narrative that is pushed so hard.
           </p>
           <p>
            I just re-checked QAnon.pub (a passive aggregator of Q posts, including all deleted ones). The comments to the videos were made two months ago, and I manually checked all of the mid-February to March submissions with YouTube links and none links to this video. This looks to be disinfo shills trying to make it look like Q mentioned adrenochrome when he did not -- which would fit into the huge adrenochrome push I saw on Twitter among Q followers. We've witnessed the very same narrative push here both in 2016 and recently by accounts who didn't give a shit about our evidence requirements or submission rules. It's a dead giveaway, IMO.
           </p>
           <p>
            I would say the closest thing to adrenochrome Q has said is that reference to the Matrix you posted in your other submission tonight.

             Vindicator, something weird is going on. I was downvoted by three people within seconds, told it was a honeypot, told to change to my IP, told Adrenochrome is bullshit etc. Something REALLY weird is going on. I was just on the website. It should not warrant this kind of reaction.

              If you trust in Jesus Christ and The Truth, you will find the Answers you seek. You should also know that Argosciv has openly admitted to Satan worship and blood drinking. Read their old submissions - they are not Trustworthy and have openly mocked Jesus Christ and The Truth. Do they and the moderators downvote to hide comments, use alts, create false debates, slander those who know too much, and ban The Truth through lies and manipulation? You can be sure they do.

              The Agenda for Eternal Enslavement is real as depicted in the Matrix, and connected with Microsoft’s recent video with MA. Adrenochrome is also real and plays a significant role in their Agenda. Google’s connection is not a coincidence. Apple’s logo is not a coincidence. Amazon’s smile is not a coincidence. Elon Musk is not as “cool” as he is portrayed to be.

              Go to Argosciv’s past submissions and his entire ‘series’ about the Root of Corruption in Racine. He knows nothing about Racine. He operates multiple accounts, and the moderators have partnered with him after members of this forum were murdered after meeting in Racine.

Srayzie and others were exposed for running blackmail operations, and Great Awakening was created to split the Pizzagate crowd with Q serving as the False Prophet while the Agenda is implemented.

              Q began after SenateAnon said to “keep digging into Racine”, yet Q never did. Neither did any of the moderators. Quite the opposite in fact, they claim they are attacked by an advanced bot who protects pedos, yet The Truth shared about Racine exposes Luciferian pedophiles who made The Deal with Donald Trump for the 8th Wonder of the World. They are desperate, and have an army they employ to attack and slander anyone who exposes The Truth. They can Repent and be forgiven at any time. Will they?

                Okay, just figured out what the site was really for.
               </p>
               <p>
                Short version: It was a deceptive operation used to bump up the value of the
                <em>
                 actual
                </em>
                ADC "audio coin", which is acquired via mining.
               </p>
               <p>
                In the days surrounding the registration date of adrenochrome.net (Jan 8th, 2018), which promoted a fabricated 'alt coin' cyrptocurrency named for the compound and with the same identifier of "ADC", the real ADC's value skyrocketed – peaking by Jan 10, 2018.
               </p>
               <p>
                It's incredibly likely that adrenochrome.net was/is mining AudioCoin via website visitors, that this Natalie Lambert is a grifter and otherwise pushing the Adrenochrome narrative for the purpose of publicity and money – she's not the only one doing exactly that either.

                I know. I can see how it looks when you get a response like that in anon. I'm not sure who the other person is in your QRV submission riling you up, but they're right to be averse to visiting that site.

                Which is precisely why I suggest contacting your isp for a new IP address, in case the site is tracking visitor IPs. Whether it is or isn't tracking IPs, the 2018 registration year suggests that the site was created under false pretenses to push the Adrenochrome narrative, which as

                mentioned, lacks credibility/merit and is indeed pushed severely by suspicious accounts (see also, SBBH coming in here to play to your suspicions and make you feel like the cautions are coming from shills; they're – for whatever reason – trying to push the narrative when it is well known that SBBH folk do not care for pizzagaters/qanons).
