<p>I also feel it important to point out another reason I wanted to DISCUSS this video: Alias <strong>Rusty Shackleford\'s SAFETY.</strong> I believe there has been no activity from him in two weeks now.  He was visiting the island very regularly, becoming bolder and bolder, and uploading often- sometimes daily. This will be the longest lapse in time between uploads as of yet. In his last video you do see what some believe to be his boat. He has never made this mistake before. It is only for a moment but perhaps all that is needed to ID, as the 4k footage has helped us do the same, and Epstein owns the local marinas. I hope I am wrong and its really just drone problems, a well deserved break, or really is Mcafee and he just ran out of blow. </p>

            Could it just be that this truck is for making, and transporting concrete. While the trucks you see on the road are only for transporting from a factory to a work area.

            Therefre this type is just more convenient on an island like this.

             Yes that explanation is entirely possible. The machine could be more maneuverable on the dirt roads, lighter, cheaper, and as you pointed out: would provide a more efficient way of mixing and transporting on-site. I still wonder why someone would need to buy the equipment rather than hiring an equipped contractor. Typically this means you're at least avoiding getting permits for your construction, or are hiding the work you are doing.  It is not a maintenance tool, like you could argue for the lawnmower or even backhoe, this is cement.

             Zoro Development LLC was created for similar reasons by them in NM. Less oversight or county reporting from contractors.
            </p>
            <p>
             For those reasons, I thought it worthy to provide evidential support for the rumors of underground facility, or concrete coverup.

            I recall reading that Epstein never bothered with permits for some or all of the work on his islands. VI authorities objected, but like workers at the airport said about his Lolita Express arriving with 12 year olds, "Epstein tipped well."

             . This devil got away with everything if thats true. There should still be record if the VI authorities objected, all of that is filed by the territory municipal gov. Although we don't know how much has been scrubbed from the records due to bribes.  Does anyone know the address they would file under?

             Thank you, I'm aware of CEMEX, but I'll read your sub in detail. I provided a link to the Carmix site in the parent, it seems they are Canadian Co and they also sell used equipment, but their names and work are too close to not investigate.

             Though the timing doesn't bode well for the theory that this was used as part of shotcrete subterranean construction, rather looks like it was used to fill in/ deconstruct, alongside the other equipment shown in the 9/23 video.

              And, I have a problem even writing this, but what if there were dead bodies (children) still on this island and the evidence was being buried in concrete?

            Question? Were is the local cement already mixed retailer in relation to that island? How far of a drive is that? Do cement trucks drive on water nowadays? Do you need to worry about the DOT?

             Great questions, let me know if you find out anything...
            </p>
            <p>
             IMO The scale (smaller eq) and fact that They OWN the machine makes me think this was done away from oversight or permitting if thats what you're implying. This machine isn't going to get filled up at a CEMEX plant but rather by a small crew with bags of quick crete. The shovel end is there to be able to mix rubble and demolished cave rock remains into the mix as well. Again there are explanations, like not wanting to ferry loads of cement to the island, but it sure looks fishy.

              Ok, enough with questions.
             </p>
             <p>
              All small operations and build sites use 'batching plants '. Thisbis were they make thier own mix and slury. They then need to take transport that short distances via whatever really. What we see at pedo island is nothing less than a basic professional operation.  With that said, that the equipment is not strange but rather indicative of professional concrete work, then what is it being used for. I still yield your question of that but none of us have the answer. We would have to storm the place and investigate because at this time, and I dont believe at anytime,  we will not receive the island 'blueprints'.

               I agree, this proves nothing but raises the question 'What was it used for?' and suggests "what it COULD be used for".

               While THEY would likely not include secret tunnels in their blueprints or plans, most US States require a building and planning dept  check and approval for any construction. Plans and blueprints are included in the submittal and are indeed PUBLIC information, though sometimes not accessible online. This is why I believe Ep created Zoro Development LLC -a developer entity within their control, who would not submit certain information about what they were building.

              Making cement is not complicated and likely most ingredients can resourced near by and if you have $1b , then acquiring other ingredients for the number one used commodity is easier than cake, literally easier than getting a cake.

              Agreed. This is what I think is happening. The machine even mixes the right ratio for you, just add water. I'd even say his crew of groundskeepers could figure it out.

            To be real... On an island you would use batching plants rather than a transport truck like you see on the road.. really not that strong beside the fact they are using it for subterranean projects.

             True Tacos, they are not exclusively used underground. This smaller unit (batching plant?) would be preferable (to a large truck) on the island on the surface as well. But wouldn't they just use the contractors (and their equipment) if it was for any of the homes built, or the other likely permitted structures. I am simply reiterating the accusations of underground operations, and providing support for the theory with data from the video has provided. Skepticism is important- but we cannot deny the reoccurring underground element to so many of these cases.

               Might not even need their help on this one, but if we can prove that they sent a few pallets of mix, it would certainly be that much more incriminating.

               Honestly, I never even associated the underground tunnels with cement (more thinking drills and boring equipment, and cement exclusively as the hide-the-body method) until I started researching this machine and shotcrete.

                EEK 😬 I hope you don’t find anything. We don’t even have mice.  Our new place is ancient so happy digging. All this talk about underground cement reminds me of Jimmy Hoffa. The story is that he is now wearing a cement suit courtesy of the Mafia. If they are constructing tunnels what a way to hide some bodies. Would be interesting if Jeff had any toes to CEMEX. Think about it. He could get just about anything built on that island with the help of the CIA and CEMEX.
