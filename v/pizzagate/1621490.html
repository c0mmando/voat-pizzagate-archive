            I'm not a fan of either of these  guys. I watched this vid.   I decided to watch a few of Jones vids  and noticed    that he recently had his proclaimed  buddy  John McAfee on his show :

            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            The comments underneath the vid are interesting.
           </p>
           <p>
            A showcase  documentary  claims that  McAfee was a pedo among many other things.   The docu is up on their webpage and tv channel.

           <p>
            @ 1:00 McAfee  the ytube trailer interview  McAfee admits,
            <code>
             I do have teenage girlfriends and many at a time.

           <blockquote>
            <p>
             By BBN Staff:  Four Belizeans (Tyrone Moralez, Zaira Majil, Saka Canul and Cassia Chavarria ) interviewed for the Showtime documentary “ Gringo” which is about the life and times that the anti-virus pioneer John McAfee spent in Belize are claiming that they were “induced with alcohol and monetary payment” by the producers of the film to fabricate false information about John McAfee.
            </p>
            <p>
             The 4 people are also claiming that they were made to sign papers which they were unable to read under the circumstances.
            </p>
            <p>
             Their attorney, Bryan A Neal has issued a statement informing Nanette Burstein and Jeff Wise, the Showtime producers of “Gringo” to refrain from publishing any and all footage attributable of them in the film.
            </p>
            <p>
             According to the statement, the 4 Belizeans were exploited to provide false information for the “Gringo” documentary, through misleading questioning from Showtime representatives.
            </p>
            <p>
             The statement ends by saying that the 4 Belizeans will host a press conference today to answer any and all questions from the local media about how they were preyed by the Showtime producers.
            </p>
           </blockquote>
           <p>
            The Belize article sounds off.   The showcase producers got 4 people in a drunken stupor and they all corroborated a story that matched each other?
           </p>
           <p>
            A lawyer would give an option of retracting OR  sue the show and the 4 people,  in which case the show would retract the show.
            <br/>
            or retracting  AND sue for defamation.
The McAfee lawyer only asked for a removal and the shows still up.
           </p>
           <p>
            I've got zero respect for Jones and  I don't  trust his information.

            yeah i watched the whole thing. he went off the rails a few time in a way that might frighten normies but depending how open minded they are this could be good stuff. He did say comet was innocent a shocking amount of times, but i could see that as covering your ass if a lawsuit has already been threatened
