<p><strong>So that is the CDAN blind, as least as best as I can explain it</strong>. </p>
<p>As I’m sure folks realize, there is no way you can confirm or deny something like a CDAN post other than trying to find corroborating information elsewhere. But as I’m sure many folks here might know, the most definitive evidence I could find, outside the CDAN blind, that Monica Petersen actually was in Haiti investigating some kind of human trafficking, is a Jan. 2016 Facebook post shared by Bella Robinson, who is a Rhode Island-area sex worker and sex worker rights advocate, and was a confirmed friend of Monica Petersen, according to the same Washington article by WaPO reporter Glenn Kessler. </p>
<p>In the January 4th, 2016 post shared by Bella Robinson on Facebook, Bella claims to be sharing a report from Monica Petersen, who supposedly was in Haiti at the time. The 2016 WaPo article, does in fact confirm that Monica did visit Haiti “… a number of times.” (You can see multiple postings of <a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1428193">Bella’s Jan. 2016 Facebook post</a> embedded on this other Voat thread about the Petersen investigation).  According to Bella’s post, Monica reported that she was actively investigating the Clinton’s ongoing deep ties to corruption in Haiti, in particular the Clinton’s family’s shady links to the Morne Bossa mine in the north of Haiti. The Morne Bossa mine is located right next to the Clinton Foundation-sponsored Caracol Industrial Complex (i.e textile sweatshop), near Cap Hatien in Northern Haiti. Again, according to Bella’s post on Facebook, Monica claimed in her “travel update”-type report:</p>
<p>“..the real significance of this scandal for me, I know you feel me Bella, is the <strong>link to contemporary slavery and trafficking. I can’t say to what extent, but there is human trafficking happening through the Clinton’s Caraol [sic] Complex</strong>. And mining has always been historically linked to trafficking, slavery, and labor exploitation.” </p>
<p>This Facebook post was clearly only shared by Bella to her own little group of friends back in January 2016, well before Monica’s death and before all this became news. </p>
<p>In the <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2016/12/06/another-false-pizzagate-tale-the-death-of-a-sex-worker-activist-in-haiti/?noredirect=on&amp;utm_term=.52defeae61d9">Dec. 2016 Washington Post article</a> about Monica’s death, written by WaPo reporter Glenn Kessler, Bella Robinson is interviewed. The entire focus of Kessler’s article, from start to finish, is a debunking job against the supposed “conspiracy theories” about Monica’s death. In the WaPo article, Bella denies that Monica’s trip to Haiti had anything at all to do with investigating human trafficking. However, in the very same article, Kessler claims that Bella herself was the one who started the supposed Monica Petersen “conspiracy theories.” According to Kessler’s WaPo article:</p>
<p>“An acquaintance named Bella Robinson, a sex worker and activist in Rhode Island, in January had posted a blog post that Petersen had shared on Facebook that had been critical of the Clinton Foundation’s work in Haiti. Shortly after Petersen’s death, the blog post appeared in a Reddit discussion thread. This then resulted in a flurry of “news stories” falsely claiming that Petersen had written the blog post and was killed for investigating the Clintons.” </p>
<p>The<a href="https://imgur.com/TmiB2gU"> blog post</a> linked to from the WaPo article, containing Bella’s posts about Petersen, is in fact a random imgur image hosting website with screenshots of posts from Bella, Monica Petersen, the Human Trafficking Center, and the “Laboratory to Combat Human Trafficking.” The imgur site linked to from the WaPo article, does in fact contain one of Bella’s posts quoting Monica Petersen’s investigation into the Clintons in Haiti. <strong>However, the imgur site linked to by the WaPo article, does not contain the specific Facebook post from Jan. 2016 by Bella Robinson, in which Monica Petersen specifically alleges that there is human trafficking happening at the Clinton-sponsored Caracol sweatshop in Haiti</strong>. So how can Kessler dismiss the whole thing as “false reporting” about Monica and Bella’s posts, when he himself is not being truthful about what Bella actually said about Monica’s reporting from Haiti?? </p>

             “..the real significance of this scandal for me, I know you feel me Bella, is the link to contemporary slavery and trafficking. I can’t say to what extent, but there is human trafficking happening through the Clinton’s Caraol [sic] Complex. And mining has always been historically linked to trafficking, slavery, and labor exploitation.”

           <p>
            This reminds me of the recent case of John of God, who was also involved in mining and sexual slavery, and child trafficking.

            Uncanny picture of Obama and Mohammad Subud, the founder of the Subud cult
           </p>
           <p>
            Kissner shows links between Obama’s “mother” Stanly Ann Dunham to a certain Subud spiritual cult and also documents the verifiable link between the Subud cult and one Loretta Fuddy.
           </p>
           <p>
            Fuddy, you will remember, was the woman who had been appointed in January, 2011, to head the agency in Hawaii that “verified” Obama’s birth certificate…The one he finally, after years of questions, displayed to the world in March of 2011.
           </p>
           <p>
            Fuddy also was the lone non-survivor of a small plane crash off the coast of Hawaii just a couple of months ago.
