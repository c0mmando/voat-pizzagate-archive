<p>PENNSYLVANIA SUPREME COURT BLOCKS RELEASE OF PRIEST SEX ABUSE REPORT </p>
<p>The Pennsylvania Supreme Court on Wednesday blocked the expected release of a massive report examining sexual abuse and misconduct by priests in six Pennsylvania dioceses, including Allentown.</p>
<p>The state’s high court issued an order barring Cambria County Judge Norman Krumenacker, who supervised the grand jury that heard testimony over two years, and Pennsylvania Attorney General Josh Shapiro from releasing the report until further order.</p>
<p>The court’s order does not indicate who sought to block release of the report but it indicates the court received more than one application for a stay.</p>
<p>Matt Kerr, spokesman for the Allentown Diocese, said the diocese was not one of the petitioners that moved to block the report.</p>
<p>“We have not and will not,” he said.</p>
<p>The Harrisburg Diocese also did not move to block the report, spokesman Mike Barley said. The Scranton Diocese said it did not request the stay and would not.</p>
<p>Greensburg Diocese’s spokesman said neither the diocese nor Bishop Edward C. Malesic filed the court postponement request.</p>
<p>A spokesman for the Pittsburgh Diocese said, “Neither the Diocese of Pittsburgh nor Bishop David Zubik have motions pending before the Supreme Court to block the release of the report.”</p>
<p>The Erie Diocese could not be reached.</p>
<p>Attorney Richard Serbin, who has represented numerous people in cases alleging sexual abuse by priests for around 30 years, said he was shocked and disappointed by the order.</p>
<p>“The issue of child sex abuse that has gone on for decades within the church needs to be exposed and I’m disappointed in any proceeding or maneuver that delays that,” he said.</p>
<p>Serbin said he knows that evidence against priests that previously had not been disclosed publicly was presented to the grand jury.</p>
<p>After the court issued its order, state Rep. Mark Rozzi, D-Berks, was distraught and angry, calling the decision “a punch in the gut.” Rozzi, who testified before the grand jury, has spoken publicly, often in graphic detail, about the priest who raped him growing up in Reading. Last week, he held a news conference saying the release of the grand jury report could spur the Legislature to pass a new bill enhancing the legal rights of adults who experienced child sex abuse.</p>
<p>On Wednesday afternoon, Rozzi sat in his office, his face in his hands, with a scrapbook of news clippings about child sex abuse issues and a hastily written speech before him. He called the court order a “travesty of justice and an insult to all victims of childhood sex abuse, not just Catholic victims.”</p>
<p>He questioned why the Supreme Court would get involved in the release of the grand jury report when state law does not permit that and the high court never issued a stay in any other grand jury report involving child sex abuse and cover-ups. Rozzi added he hoped the court was not trying to protect religious figures and “public officials and community leaders” whom Krumenacker hinted would be identified in his prior order rejecting legal requests to postpone publication.</p>
<p>“This is absolutely devastating to many victims,” Rozzi said. “I understand the Supreme Court is going to review legal challenges. So this is not it. We have an opportunity for this report still to still be released.”</p>
<p>Several people who testified and advocacy groups say the report’s findings could be devastating to the church, not only because of the abuse but also alleged efforts to cover it up.</p>
<p>“It’ll be blistering,” said James Faluszczak, who says he was abused as a teenager by Monsignor Daniel J. Martin, an Erie priest who died in 2006.</p>
<p>Court records, news accounts and data compiled by advocacy groups show that more than two dozen priests in the Allentown Diocese or serving the Lehigh Valley outside of diocesan administration have been accused of sexual misconduct going back to the 1960s.</p>
<p>The diocesan administration led by Bishop Alfred Schlert — who became bishop after the grand jury was empaneled — said it cooperated fully with investigators.</p>
<p>“We welcome the release of the report,” the diocese said in a statement this month. “This story needs to be told, so that we can learn from the report and continue to improve protections for children.”</p>
<p>Along with Allentown, the investigation covers the Erie, Greensburg, Harrisburg, Pittsburgh and Scranton dioceses. Last weekend, Scranton Bishop Joseph C. Bambera offered his “deepest apologies to the victims of such abuse, to their families, to the faithful of our church and to everyone impacted by the behaviors described in this report.”</p>
<p>The investigation began in 2016 after another grand jury looking at the Altoona-Johnstown Diocese found at least 50 priests or religious leaders had sexually abused hundreds of minors. The report also found many of the allegations were not reported to law enforcement, but instead were covered up by bishops for decades. Grand juries looking into complaints in the Archdiocese of Philadelphia reported similarly explosive findings. The forthcoming report would cover the remaining dioceses in Pennsylvania.</p>
<p>More than 250,000 Catholics are in the Allentown Diocese. Across Pennsylvania, 3.2 million people are Catholic, according to the Pennsylvania Catholic Conference.</p>
<p>PREVIOUS GRAND JURIES - Grand juries also investigated allegations in the state\'s other two dioceses.</p>
<p>2005: Philadelphia grand jury investigates allegations against more than 60 priests, finding abusive priests were moved around and not reported to police.</p>
<p>2011: Phildelphia\'s second grand jury focused on the church\'s practices since 2005, finding many credibly accused priests remained active; charges are filed against three priests, a teacher and Monsignor William Lynn, who was convicted of recklessly endangering children for not removing an abusive priest. His conviction was overturned, then reinstated and he awaits retrial.</p>

             “I think we’re all waiting for the report to see what’s in it,” Northampton County District Attorney John Morganelli said. “I’m a little bit puzzled by the Supreme Court’s decision. It’s an issue of public interest and concern. It might be just a temporary thing.”

             Krumenacker’s order dealt with a request from six defense lawyers representing unnamed individuals who are mentioned but not charged in the report. The lawyers wanted Krumenacker to postpone the report’s publication or redact parts of it. The lawyers also wanted a chance to cross-examine witnesses and present their own evidence to ensure their clients’ receive due process and the right to a clean reputation under the state constitution.

             These people have the money to pay for a lawyer to keep his name out.
            </p>
            <p>
             His name was brought out in the grand jury, I don't know if he will be named, not all names are published, but I know someone testified regarding their abuse.  I KNOW SOMEONE WHO NAMED MSGR THOMAS J BENESTAD AS THEIR ABUSER. THIS PERSON TESTIFIED IN PITTSBURGH LAST FEBRUARY OF 2017 IN FRONT OF THE GRAND JURY.
            </p>
            <p>
             PLEASE, HOW DOES ONE KNOW THERE ARE SIX PEOPLE HOLDING UP THE AG REPORT FOR FEAR OF THEIR NAMES BEING RELEASED. THIS IS THE MOST IMPORTANT LINK TO THIS WHOLE F... MESS.  THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR HELP

            Put them all in front of a firing squad, including the judges who cover up for them, and let the abused and their families fire away! -  Sick of all this now, it needs to be exposed and these blind sheep (their congregations) to wake up and revolt.

             I sent this post to StcharlesSeminary.  There were few words.  She surely is taking this pretty hard.  I have no words for her.  After all these years there should be some reward for the Victims.  She was not permitted to join because SRA was not allowed to participate.  Another group they wish to just sweep under the rug.   I agree with your punishment.

            Here' an update stating that none of the dioceses requested the block and that it probably resulted from requests for delay or redaction by six people who are named in the grand jury report but not charged with anything.  They're worried about their reputations.

             From what I have read on and off today and in this article you linked to, this is highly unusual for the Supreme Court to interfere and seems to me is probably a case of these six protesters that are worried their reputations will be bruised.  They have not even been charged, only mentioned. Well, I hope that they are victorious in their appeal and that those six that were only mentioned, I hope their names are read out Very Loudly.

            Here are the members of the Pennsylvania Supreme Court who made this decision:

             There is something fishy about a Republican sticking up for the 4 Democrat Judges.  Something is Rotten.  Btw, that guy would look good with an apple in his mouth.  Oven Ready.

             Those judges have to be replaced They are all Dems except for 1 on the Pen Supreme Court. That should never be allowed.  They are elected and I am sure there is chicanery with that as well.

             Stcharles Seminary was not well at the time and could not make it to the grand jury announcement.  I am glad she did not go although she wanted to with all her heart.  I can see her as defiant, not weak.  She is a pillar.  I am stuck to outing these Bleeping Priests and finding the Missing Children.  As I am sure are many on here.

            “It’ll be blistering,” said James Faluszczak, who says he was abused as a teenager by Monsignor Daniel J. Martin, an Erie priest who died in 2006.

             http://www.thecourierexpress.com/news/local/ex-priest-names-former-ecc-headmaster-as-alleged-abuser/article_b09f2df1-3e7b-512f-9d93-586469d28aed.html

           <p>
            Former-priest James Faluszczak, 48, now of Buffalo, N.Y., has decided to speak out — naming his alleged abuser, an Erie priest with local ties.
           </p>
           <p>
            Faluszczak has identified the Rev. Monsignor Daniel J. Martin, who served as pastor of St. Boniface Parish, Kersey, in 1962, and as headmaster of Elk County Christian, as the school was then called, serving there until 1970. Martin died in 2006 at age 88.
           </p>
           <p>
            The incident has surfaced as Faluszczak claims to have been one of many witnesses to testify before a grand jury, whose proceedings are secret and which was convened at the request of the Pennsylvania Attorney General’s Office around September 2016 to investigate sex abuse allegations in dioceses throughout Pennsylvania, according to the Erie-Times News.
           </p>
           <p>
            Faluszczak said that Martin molested him when he was 16 to 19 years old, adding that the abuse occurred at St. George and at Mt. Calvary Church and then at Mercyhurst College, now Mercyhurst University, all in the Erie area, where Faluszczak said Martin was living at the time.
           </p>
           <p>
            Faluszczak added that Martin used the knowledge of his family’s hardships in the 1980s “to groom” him for the abuse.
           </p>
           <p>
            “Most people would see this as irony but it’s really pathology,” said Faluszczak in a phone interview Saturday morning.
           </p>
           <p>
            Despite the abuse, Faluszczak became a priest in 1996 and spent nearly 20 years in active ministry. He eventually would serve two of the same congregations as had his alleged abuser.
           </p>
           <p>
            He served locally in the Elk County Catholic school system, of which Martin was the first headmaster, and then as the pastor of St. Boniface Parish in Kersey, where Martin also served.
           </p>
           <p>
            “Father Martin lived in that rectory for two years while he built Elk County Catholic. I had to sleep in the same bedroom as he slept in how many years prior,” Faluszczak said. “I loved being at St. Boniface. I loved my community, and I loved my parish... that was my flock.
           </p>
           <p>
            “But in the back of my mind I still had that notion that Father Martin had lived in that house.”
           </p>
           <p>
            Faluszczak also served for a time as a campus minister at Clarion University.
           </p>
           <p>
            Ultimately, the Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder he experienced as a result of his abuse led to panic attacks, especially at the altar of St. Boniface. That led him to drink periodically, he said, to numb some of what he was feeling. Eventually he would be charged with a DUI in Fox Township in 2014.
           </p>
           <p>
            “I had been abused by Father Martin and then I was in these situations where I was constantly reminded of him and in some of my assignments I was surrounded by people doing these pathological things,” Faluszczak said. “And all of that took a toll on me.”
           </p>
           <p>
            Erie Diocese spokeswoman Anne-Marie Welsh said Saturday, “We are still in the process of confirming identities of the accused that will be published within the next few weeks. At that time, we expect to have a news conference during which we will provide additional information.”

              I don't know why Christine Donohue's name is at the bottom of the RICO Court Case,  I found it while looking her up.

               I have seen a lot of great court cases get squashed by upper courts. The excuse is they don't have enough judges to oversee all the cases because of the outdated system. They have an oversight commission to review what cases can be heard. In the case of the Ninth, that is especially true because when they set up the framework, that was frontier country with very little population, but now it is not at all.  The ninth needs to be broken into as many districts as it is territories to form a republic representation. Arizona to Guam?

                Sounds about right, but I don't see it happening.  They will fight it every step of the way.  Especially with all these cases right now coming to the forefront.

                 Does not matter if the court case loses due to not being heard/other. People are watching, and everything is being recorded. Just brings bad publicity to the defendants, and the judicial system that did everything by doing nothing.

              Christine Donohue ran for Supreme Court Judge.  It has her name at the end of the copy I posted.  She is listed in the Wiki

             <p>
              Donohue ran as a Democrat for Pennsylvania Supreme Court in 2015, and was part of a Democratic sweep of all three court vacancies, along with Kevin Dougherty, and David Wecht. They defeated Republican candidates Judith Olsen, Michael George, and Anne Covey, in a campaign that saw more than $15 million in donations from special interests.[2] Donohue received a "highly recommended" rating from the Pennsylvania Bar Association,[3] which noted her reputation for "intelligence, conscientiousness and objectivity".[5]

             Only Erie failed to respond, so logic has it that they were the ones that made the call up the hill, or maybe they are just practicing self-flagellation in advance, and could not hear the phone.

               Yes, I think there is a reason beyond the rule of law.  It is highly unusual for the Supreme Court to be involved, which proves there is something going on behind the scenes.  There are priests that have not been charged but are being named.  They are being protected.  What to do about the protection of the children?  And the victims?  Who cares for them.  No one.
