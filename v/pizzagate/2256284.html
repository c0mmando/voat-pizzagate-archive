<p>Blind Item #5 - Himmmm
Another classic Himmmm blind. Again, I have only replaced names with a description and removed some easy identifiers. I have left his writing intact.</p>
<p>The REAL story I wanted to share with you has to do with more recent times. The 90\'s.   A spoiled, stoned, comedic dipshit named ______________ thought he was hot s<strong>t.  Everybody gave him a break due to family connections. So spoiled b</strong>tch-ass _______ got his shot and blew up big on MTV and stupid movies, etc.  He also was a spoiled brat with the hookers and blow all over Hollywood, disrespecting everyone in sight.</p>
<p>So punk b**ch ________ started hanging with rock stars, Guns n Roses, Crue, etc. and Charlie Sheen and porn stars like Savannah and Kelly Jackson (or whatever her name was in porn). He also got used to being comped everywhere in town. Trash a room at the Roosevelt? Comped. Heidi\'s girls? Comped. Buckets of cocaine? Comped. Meals at Drai\'s, parties at the Rainbow, or puking on diners inside Louise\'s Trattoria in Los Feliz? All comped. When he couldn\'t get it up? He blamed the whores. Not the cocaine, or because he liked tossing man salad  – he blamed the hookers for being lazy. (Ask poor ______________ ((co-star from one of his earlier movies who everyone knows, I Enty have a permanent soft spot)) what SHE endured from that douche-canoe). Then one night, his world changed forever.</p>
<p>This was around 1993 or 1994 I believe, and people on the Sunset Strip had grown weary of his shtick, and studios were weary of his one-note routine that no longer made as much money.  Even his family was sick of it.  Most of all though, the hookers grew very tired of his demands, lack of payment, and his physical abuse.  A major no-no to a glamour puss.  Even Charlie Sheen didn\'t hit in the face or rough up a studio head\'s favorite girl.  Charlie only shot his girlfriends. But ______ was too stupid and spoiled to know that rule.</p>
<p>After an epic 48 hour coke bender, several fights with his agents and others telling him his career\'s heading in the toilet _______ keeps partying.  He calls for Heidi\'s girls and is warned.  He agrees and agrees to credit card pay up front, so two girls go over to party.  He wanted one special girl and he paid a ton for her. Somewhere in there ______ came unglued and beat the one special escort within inches of her life.  This was a stunning young beauty  (at the end of the blind, Himmmm seems to indicate the escort is this former B- list actress/model/reality star who is an A- list celebrity ALL of you know) from a solid family.  An emerging legit actress hooking for the party fun and connections.  _______ put her in the hospital.</p>
<p>When the escort\'s favorite customer – a studio exec - found out? He was livid.  He ordered a total blackballing of _________ from the business, even calling in threats to Katzenberg at Disney to get ________ shafted.  Sent several guys to visit _______\'s family and force them to make it right or they would.  Serious guys who could do damage.  Heidi and her backers were not so professional.  With the escort\'s other favorite actor client supporting them, Heidi\'s backers went and snatched _____ that night.  They beat him to a pulp and did very nasty things to him, took photos, video, and black-bagged him.  The next morning he woke up hoisted on the D of the Hollywood sign.  How he got down nobody knows.</p>
<p>Within days _____ went on vacation and didn\'t set foot back in town for months.  _______ and his family paid a handsome fee to the young escort.  Even put her in a new comedy parody film with big comedy stars.  Legend had it that _______ was one of the tipsters to lead to the raid on Heidi Fleiss.  Luckily the escort was out of the Madame\'s business after this event.  She recovered fully, and even took her hospital stay as a chance to get new breasts since they were repairing her face anyway.  She left the full-time escort life shortly after, and her studio executive clients helped get her work in legit films.  Her other best client, the actor, also helped her.  He eventually married her and got free threesomes with the escort and _______________ (former A list mostly television actress who seems to frequently get arrested for drugs and other DUI type things) as a bonus.</p>
<p>_________\'s career went into the toilet.  Pathetically enough? He recently gave an interview to a former B+ list actor/host on his show about how &quot;sad&quot; he is while lamenting the loss of his glorious fame, career, and life of luxury.  He whines like a p<strong>sy about bad movie roles, and growing older, but NEVER mentions the real reason behind his fall.  Denies drugs. He spends the whole interview pissing and moaning, and whining about how he was bigger than everyone.  You can see the interviewer thinking &quot;f</strong>k him&quot; during the interview.  Priceless.</p>',
