<p>Let\'s get started. Paige Young was a Playboy playmate of the month back in November of 1968. By 1974, she had been sexually abused so much at the hands of Hugh Hefner and Bill Cosby, that she ended up killing herself with a gun. She drew a pentagram in her own blood on the wall before killing herself, and had hundreds of pictures of Hugh Hefner. Immediately before her suicide, she had spent time out of the country with famous director John Huston, more on him later.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/film/film-news/11505950/playboy-mansion-jack-nicholson-secret-tunnels.html">http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/film/film-news/11505950/playboy-mansion-jack-nicholson-secret-tunnels.html</a></p>
<p>Now here\'s where shit starts going from weird to terrifying. There are tunnels under the Playboy mansion connecting it to famous houses. For example, Jack Nicholson and Kirk Douglas. Douglas was accused of raping Natalie Wood, and is commonly thought of being responsible for her death, but there\'s little proof (sorry for Gawker source).</p>
<p><a href="http://gawker.com/5893793/did-robert-downey-jr-really-just-accuse-kirk-douglas-of-a-brutal-rape">http://gawker.com/5893793/did-robert-downey-jr-really-just-accuse-kirk-douglas-of-a-brutal-rape</a></p>
<p>Nicholson\'s house is far more ominous. It was at his house that Roman Polanski raped a 13 year old in a hot tub, back in 1977, and fled the country.</p>
<p>Roman Polanski made the film Chinatown, starring Jack Nicholson, a movie about a massive government conspiracy involving murder and billionaires. The main villain, Noah Cross, was an incestuous, child raping, pedophile, and was played by John Huston. Yup, the same John Huston Paige Young had been put of the country with immediately before killing herself in a satanic ritual. Polanski\'s other film, Rosemary\'s Baby, was about a woman becoming impregnated by a satanic cult, made before his pregnant wife, Sharon Tate, was murdered by Charles Manson\'s cult.</p>
<p>I\'m sure this goes much deeper than just what I\'ve found. Kubrick\'s films were often about conspiracies, like Eyes Wide Shut, and he seemed to intentionally choose actors who were involved with Hollywood elite. Kirk Douglas was in Spartacus and Paths of Glory, Jack Nicholson was in the Shining, Scientologist Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman were in Eyes Wide Shut.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.google.com/amp/s/gumshoenews.com/2017/05/14/nicole-kidmans-father-silenced-by-ninth-circle-satanic-cult/amp/">https://www.google.com/amp/s/gumshoenews.com/2017/05/14/nicole-kidmans-father-silenced-by-ninth-circle-satanic-cult/amp/</a></p>
<p>And finally, Ryan O\'Neal, who was in Barry Lyndon, was accused of violently beating Anjelica Huston (yup, John Huston\'s younger sister) who was dating Jack Nicholson at the time, and talks about Polanski\'s arrest in this article.</p>

<p>Kubrick\'s death is very strange as well. It occurred on March 6th, 1999, the 66th day of the year, and exactly 666 days before January 1st, 2001, the dawn of the new millennium, his most famous film 2001, and the year 9/11 would occur, which most agree, was the start of the &quot;New Era&quot;. His last film, Eyes Wide Shut, was not released and some would argue it was not even finished.</p>

<p>This seems like it was likely a response to the Satanic rituals of the elite and Rothschild parties of the 1970s, in fact the satanic party in the movie was even filmed at a Rothschild mansion.</p>',

            Oh -- coming back to Bill Cosby -- why wouldn't we suspect that he was connected to MKULTRA program?
Don't know what kind of a story CIA might have delivered to these Hollywood celebs to cause them to participate, but they may also have promised great rewards?
           </p>
           <p>
            Didn't know about Kirk Douglas and Pier Angeli ... .&gt; Douglas was accused of raping Natalie Wood, and is commonly thought of being responsible for her death, but there's little proof (sorry for Gawker source).
Never heard that story, but there was obviously something very odd going on there.
           </p>
           <p>
            Agree with you that if Cosby were allowed to talk that there would likely be a lot of damage done to Hollywood.
           </p>
           <p>
            Seems like they'll continue to protect him from jail and incarceration -- but what might they eventually do with him?

            Bill Cosby has always been a creep to me even before all this shit got exposed. My hinky meter was off the chart watching him especially when he took over the Kids Say The Darnedest Things. I found him very insincere, disingenuous and awkward around kids.
I am predicting it now....his daughter Erinn (who basically ran away from her household) will tell all once he dies. Because I have a very strong feeling she herself was molested by him. And don't get me started with his murdered son Ennis....because I believe he was killed cause he knew shit about his father.

            There is a GOAL mind you. Why do you think all those females came out 20-30 years later? They were
            <em>
             instructed
            </em>
            to by
            <em>
             their
            </em>
            handlers. Remember, playboy was an international prostitution and extortion ring. Hef set up playboy at the height and consolidation of the OSS into the CIA. Not only did he provide mk'd bunnies, but lotion, kleenex, two way mirrors, sound and video. There are records, and even semen samples, of thousands of former and current celebrities, sports stars and politicians from all around the world.

            How do you think they got the semen? It was smuggled out securely I'll bet.

            Bill, in full knowledge of whom he has been mingling with, knows the pact he signed. Fame and fortune babe, it's all gravy, but  your gonna go down in flames. That's the nature of the beast.

            You see, he is meant to be used as a satanic example of inversion. He was a pillar of the community, a scion,
            <strong>
             father figure
            </strong>
            , role model, IDOL. He was intentionally, purposefully elevated and propped up so that this very thing happens now as it is happening.

            The magick is a demoralizing  tool to degrade the  consciousness of the black man and all of us in general causing more separation and division.
           </p>
           <p>
            Do you really think it's any coincidence we are being subjected to the elements of his trial on Father's Day for no reason at all?

             Agree on Bill Cosby connections to MKULTRA --
            </p>
            <p>
             I'd also suggest Bill &amp; Hillary as two others involved in MKULTRA (though I think that Cathy O'Brien suggests she is just naturally evil) .... however, conscience exists unless removed by physical and mental and sexual torture.
            </p>
            <p>
             What we see of so many who are involved is that they can go about their every day activities, fully believing in the person they create for the public -- I don't think that's possible, really.  It seems to me this is all split personality stuff where the HOST isn't aware of what they are doing as other personalities.
            </p>
            <p>
             We can all barely look at the "Fatherhood" videos -- none of these people are super-human .... they have to be effected by conscience unless it has been taken from them.

           </p>
           <p>
            Think about it.  Bill Cosby is an
            <strong>
             obstetrician
            </strong>
            with his office located
            <strong>
             below his family's residence
            </strong>
            in a brownstone home in Brooklyn Heights.
           </p>
           <p>
            He intentionally invented his character, as well the producers, around a career that focuses on women's genitalia.
           </p>
           <p>
            He was well known for using this premise as his go-to grooming technique before the drugging.

            Taking the time to understand mindcontrolblackassassins take on bill cosby will help you understand a MAJOR ESSENTIAL in understanding not only pedogate, BUT YOUR OWN CONDITIONING as well.
           </p>
           <p>
            PrinceRay takes readers along the journey of bill cosbys life and places him coming out of korea and being present at Bethesda naval center, RIGHT ALONG SIDE PAPERCLIP NAZIS that were drugging women for mk ultra experiments.
           </p>
           <p>
            PrinceRay shows how cosby worked in parallel with the governments Nazis in Hollywood, alongside hugh hefners cia extortion and honey trap as you mentioned above.
           </p>
           <p>
            If this series is interpreted correctly you  will understand the breadth of the Nazi undertaking. Once the international bankers were done destroying Germany with their hired mercenary force they moved them to America to begin the same programme on us. For over the past 70 years from the fields of science, entertainment, politics and religion nazi, freemasonic and Jewish cabalists have been slowly but surely transforming minds through an ambient form of mk-ultra.
           </p>
           <p>
            Combine that with the  Rockefeller/Carnegie funded Frankfurt model schooling and you will soon realize YOU are not who you thought you were.

            It's late and all I can say I am glad this at least was a Mistrial.  Guilty would have been better but now they have another chance.  Thank God, because Bill Cosby is a scumbag. His wife is as guilty as he is.  She knows exactly what he did, and maybe she is part of it. She looks to me as she would enjoy torturing those girls.  I would like to slap that snarky smile off her face.

            The documentary, Room 237, takes a look at various themes in The Shining, including the notion Jack Nicholson's character molested and/or raped his son. Also, he was reading a Playgirl Magazine in the lobby when he first got hired on to hotel-sit.
