<p>I remember reading this thread a couple of months ago and found it odd that it was getting so much hate:
<a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1482211">https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1482211</a></p>
<p>I would like to re-open this topic and get some help digging.  It\'s pizzagate related because it has to deal directly with the Clinton Foundation as well as being mentioned over 500 times in John Podesta\'s emails.  
</p>
<hr />
<p>What originally got me looking into coffee as a codeword was the video of Norm Macdonald\'s roast at the 1997 Radio-Television Correspondents Association Dinner.  If you haven\'t watched it yet, I would suggest watching it in full...it\'s awesome!  Here is the reference to a cup of coffee:
<a href="https://youtu.be/d5kpXhq5nHM?t=8m3s">https://youtu.be/d5kpXhq5nHM?t=8m3s</a></p>
<p>The crowd\'s reaction is what initially stood out to me.  If you watch the whole video, Norm makes other jokes that are more offensive than this one but for some reason, this one got a particularly weird reaction from the crowd.    
</p>
<p>Now it took me a while to figure out what Norm was referring to with his $90,000 cup of coffee joke.  I finally figured it out when I found this transcript from an SNL Weekend Update where he again references the cup of coffee, this time with some context.  
</p>
<p>(Third paragraph down):
<a href="http://archive.is/dZClE">http://archive.is/dZClE</a>
Here it is in case you don\'t want to open and find it:</p>
<p><em>[Photo of John Huang] Meanwhile, the Indogate scandal continues to widen. Internal Democratic National Committee records now show that fundraiser John Huang was responsible for bringing two Chinese businessmen to the White House for a $180,000 &quot;coffee&quot; with the President. That works out to $90,000 for a cup of coffee, although, in the President\'s defense, the coffee was Starbucks. ... [mild reaction from crowd so Norm explains] Starbucks is a little pricey.</em></p>
<p>Interesting again how the transcript made a point to mention that there was a mild reaction from the crowd. </p>
<p>So the $90,000 coffee joke that Norm Macdonald roasted Bill Clinton with was about the 90\'s scandal dubbed Indogate or Chinagate or Libbogate.  Basically a Chinese born DNC fundraiser was bringing Chinese elites into the white house to have &quot;coffee&quot; with Bill Clinton for hundreds of thousands of dollars.  Here is the full story:  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1996_United_States_campaign_finance_controversy">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1996_United_States_campaign_finance_controversy</a></p>
<p>I\'ll just mention a couple of key players in that they connect the clintons to sex crimes which is always a good thing.  They also speak to the types of activities that these men are involved in, so it is not a stretch to say that human sex trafficking was discussed and/or paid for during these coffee talks.  
</p>
<p><strong>John Huang</strong> - DNC fundraiser who organized coffee for Yah Lin Trie and the Bill Clinton.  Visited white house at least 78 times. </p>
<p><strong>Yah Lin &quot;Charlie&quot; Trie</strong> - Little Rock entrepreneur who owned Chinese restaurant that the Clinton\'s frequented (what\'s up with billionaires owning pizza/chinese shops?).  He is a big fundraiser who took arms dealers into the white house to meet with the president.  His business partner was Ng Lap Seng (Mr. Wu) and $7 million was donated from Ng to the democratic party through &quot;Charlie&quot; Trie.  
</p>
<p><strong>Ng Lap Seng (Mr. Wu)</strong> - Property developer and businessman from Macau.  Visited white houes 10 times between \'94-\'96 including one overnight stay with President Clinton.  Owns Fortuna hotel in Macau which is a known brothel.  A couple quotes from articles on these guys:</p>
<p><em>&quot;Ng does not have a criminal record but is reported to be involved in a number of illicit activities. He is portrayed in some of the media as a “Macau Crime Lord” and, according the report, “</em><em>a kingpin of the international slave prostitution trade</em><em>”. It is reported that the Fortuna acts as a ‘hangout’ for the Shui Fong Triad – a group that is notorious for loan-sharking, protections rackets and prostitution in Macau.&quot;</em>
<a href="http://archive.is/txXlD#selection-819.1-808.11">http://archive.is/txXlD#selection-819.1-808.11</a></p>
<p>He owns the <em>&quot;Fortuna Hotel in Macao, known as much for its prostitutes working the lobby as for its floor show of whip-wielding, leather-clad dancers upstairs.&quot;</em></p>
<p>Did you catch that??? ** Bill Clinton had a kingpin of international slave trade visit the white house at least 10 times and accepted millions of dollars from him!**  Here\'s the story from the Wall Street Journal that mentions the 10 visits:  <a href="http://archive.is/qKsQ0">http://archive.is/qKsQ0</a></p>
<p>Bill Clinton was known for his ability to raise money, and he wouldn\'t have been able to do it without the help of coffee.  He came up with the bright idea to hold Coffee Klatch\'s where guests would pay tens to hundreds of thousands of dollars to come have coffee with the president and often to spend the night.  Here is a great article from the Washington Post with more details: <a href="http://archive.is/VvJ7O">http://archive.is/VvJ7O</a>
One quote that stuck out to me:</p>
<p><em>&quot;One California donor who stayed with his son in the Lincoln Bedroom said the president, dressed in a tuxedo, knocked on the door at midnight, found them watching a videotape on the White House and proceeded to give them a personal, two-hour tour of it.&quot;</em></p>
<p>Why would the president wait until midnight to give a two-hour tour of the White House?  And why the tuxedo?  Seems strange to me. 
Anyway...these Coffe Klatch\'s were a regular thing and some there were some pretty interesting people who stayed the night.  
</p>
<p>So here we have several instances where coffee <em>could</em> be interpreted as having a secret meaning.  That meaning could imply that having a &quot;cup of coffee&quot; literally means having sex or it could also mean getting together to discuss the sex slave trade.<br />
Or it could just be billionaires that are heavily involved in organized crime flying across the world and paying hundreds of thousands of dollars to have their picture taken drinking coffee with the president.  Out of the three that seems like the most far fetched.  
</p>
<hr />
<p>There are 667 references to coffee in the Podesta emails.  Most of them are probably innocent.  But if John Podesta really is the sex slave dealer that we all think he is, I would venture to say that at least some of the coffee emails are pizzagate related.  There are too many to list here and this is already a long post, but if you have time please help me go through and dig into some of the names of these people that are setting up &quot;Coffee Klatch\'s&quot; with John Podesta.  Here is one good example that somebody made a thread about a while back:  <a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1533314">https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1533314</a></p>
<p>Just to make this even more pizzagate related, let\'s tie in the Clinton Foundation.  The Clinton Foundation focuses a lot of their efforts on coffee.<br />
Here is what they are doing with Coffee in Haiti:  <a href="http://archive.is/jj4uY">http://archive.is/jj4uY</a>
Here is what they are doing with Coffee in Rwanda: <a href="http://archive.is/olGCE">http://archive.is/olGCE</a>
They set up a coffee factory in Gikondo, Rwanda.  Gikondo is a rural city where the government sends all of the street vagrants from the capital city in order to keep the capital city clean.  These street vagrants include many children, pregnant women, and sex workers.  <a href="http://archive.is/7zN2g">http://archive.is/7zN2g</a></p>
<p>One last thing to think about...star-<strong>bucks</strong> (Jk but what a weird coincidence).  
</p>
<p>PS.  here\'s a great video of Norm Macdonald on the View saying that Bill Clinton murdered someone...just to add to his credability:<br />
<a href="https://youtu.be/Z3PP_SWHUQQ?t=1m34s">https://youtu.be/Z3PP_SWHUQQ?t=1m34s</a></p>
<hr />
<p>UPDATE: Thanks 2impendingdoom for providing links to previous threads on this. Please read these for more links and backstory on Clinton\'s dealings in Macau. It\'s amazing how these people are coming up in the news now when Chinagate happened back in the \'90s. I don\'t think it\'s a coincidence.</p>
<p><a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1624415">https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1624415</a> and <a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1628669">https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1628669</a></p>
<p>Here are two articles the Wall Street Journal put out on back to back days in 1998 about all of the Macau people.</p>
<p><a href="http://archive.is/qKsQ0">http://archive.is/qKsQ0</a> and <a href="http://archive.is/1OYNM">http://archive.is/1OYNM</a></p>
<p>Just one peek inside one of the articles:</p>
<p><em>&quot;President Clinton\'s table mate at the Sheraton Carlton built his business career on the success of the Thai Palace, a &quot;</em><em>no-hands&quot; restaurant. In such establishments, naked waitresses hand-feed patrons, leaving the hands of paying customers unencumbered for other pursuits. (Prostitution is legal in Macau.)</em>* Mr. Chen is also said to have business interests in organized gambling junkets. Local triads often prey on hard-up gamblers, engaging in loan sharking, and in <strong>kidnapping</strong> and extortion when the gamblers don\'t pay up. &quot;</p>
<p>You can\'t make this stuff up. Two routes that might be worth exploring are looking into all of the people involved in Chinagate and looking at all of the guests that stayed at the white house during the Coffee Klatch\'s and seeing where they are today. I can already think of two off the top of my head that are fishy - Ron Burkle and Dan Dutko (on the Clinton hit list).</p>',

           <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/v/pizzagate/1533314">
            https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1533314
           </a>
          </p>
          <p>
           Just to make this even more pizzagate related, let's tie in the Clinton Foundation.  The Clinton Foundation focuses a lot of their efforts on coffee.
           <br/>
           Here is what they are doing with Coffee in Haiti:
           <a href="http://archive.is/jj4uY">
            http://archive.is/jj4uY
           </a>
           Here is what they are doing with Coffee in Rwanda:
           <a href="http://archive.is/olGCE">
            http://archive.is/olGCE
           </a>
           They set up a coffee factory in Gikondo, Rwanda.  Gikondo is a rural city where the government sends all of the street vagrants from the capital city in order to keep the capital city clean.  These street vagrants include many children, pregnant women, and sex workers.

           One last thing to think about...star-
           <strong>
            bucks
           </strong>
           (Jk but what a weird coincidence).
          </p>
          <p>
           PS.  here's a great video of Norm Macdonald on the View saying that Bill Clinton murdered someone...just to add to his credability:

           UPDATE: Thanks 2impendingdoom for providing links to previous threads on this. Please read these for more links and backstory on Clinton's dealings in Macau. It's amazing how these people are coming up in the news now when Chinagate happened back in the '90s. I don't think it's a coincidence.

           Here are two articles the Wall Street Journal put out on back to back days in 1998 about all of the Macau people.
          </p>
          <p>
           <a href="http://archive.is/qKsQ0">
            http://archive.is/qKsQ0

           <a href="http://archive.is/1OYNM">
            http://archive.is/1OYNM
           </a>
          </p>
          <p>
           Just one peek inside one of the articles:
          </p>
          <p>
           <em>
            "President Clinton's table mate at the Sheraton Carlton built his business career on the success of the Thai Palace, a "
           </em>
           <em>
            no-hands" restaurant. In such establishments, naked waitresses hand-feed patrons, leaving the hands of paying customers unencumbered for other pursuits. (Prostitution is legal in Macau.)
           </em>
           * Mr. Chen is also said to have business interests in organized gambling junkets. Local triads often prey on hard-up gamblers, engaging in loan sharking, and in
           <strong>
            kidnapping
           </strong>
           and extortion when the gamblers don't pay up. "
          </p>
          <p>
           You can't make this stuff up. Two routes that might be worth exploring are looking into all of the people involved in Chinagate and looking at all of the guests that stayed at the white house during the Coffee Klatch's and seeing where they are today. I can already think of two off the top of my head that are fishy - Ron Burkle and Dan Dutko (on the Clinton hit list).

            Funny thing with Becki Percy's story I live in the UK but you can do these searches yourself. At present I'm banned from twitter (5 days now) but go here to the local Hull newspaper and search for Ann Percy
            <a href="http://www.hulldailymail.co.uk/search/search.html?searchType=&amp;searchPhrase=ann+percy&amp;where=">
             http://www.hulldailymail.co.uk/search/search.html?searchType=&amp;searchPhrase=ann+percy&amp;where=
            </a>
            You will get six links that will tell you Ann Percy is the current (well in December 2016 she was) chair of the Newland Avenue Traders Association and often meets with local council officials . I've searched Lee Percy but nothing. But here is the weirdest part on the above link search Becki Percy and this will be foundhttp://www.hulldailymail.co.uk/hull-s-satanic-panic-sinister-fear-gripped-city/story-28086307-detail/story.htmlNow I've read through that article about a Satanic Cult  in Hull during the 80's and 90's but nowhere can I find Becki's name mentioned which is what usually happens when searching for a name ?So why would the Hull Daily Mail  when searching for Becki Percy throw up a story  about Satanism from a period primarily before she was even born? This is all very odd and rather sinister
           </p>
           <p>
            If you read the article that turns up when searching for Becki Percy please note its written in conjunction with local historian Mike Covell. I contacted Mike earlier today GMT and he emailed this back to me
           </p>
           <p>
            "Hi Lawrence,
           </p>
           <p>
            I will check this out, it sounds fascinating.  Spookily enough I was with a good friend of mine yesterday and we were talking about this as we were exploring an old building and he started talking about the cases that he had investigated.  Turns out we had both spent many years researching the "Satanic Panic" cases, but whilst I did it through the old newspaper reports, of which I am soon to publish in a book, he spoke to people on the ground.
           </p>
           <p>
            Funnily enough, I know Ann Percy.  When I started working freelance for the HDM three years ago she would leave nasty comments on my articles and be very negative.  I ended up removing and blocking her on social media platforms because of this.
           </p>
           <p>
            I will check out the links, I am now following Becky on Twitter and will take a look on Youtube.  It's the first I have heard of her story to be honest, but I will certainly chase it up.  Thank you for making me aware of this.
           </p>
           <p>
            Regards
           </p>
           <p>
            Mike Covell  "
           </p>
           <p>
            So it would seem that Ann Percy was blocked by Ann after she sent him nasty disparaging  comments  when he was writing for the Hull Daily Mail.  Here's Mike's blog

            This post just reminded me of Becki Percy's abusers / parents who run a Coffee shop and Father Lee Percy was involved in sex trafficking. She talks about it here:
            <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O7wjO_uwIBA">

           </p>
           <p>
            Her Mother Ann Percy owns 'Planet Coffee' in Hull, UK. This coffee shop also has a shady looking logo.

            not too long ago. Wondered if some similar program could be used on all the leaked emails, to maybe come up with patterns to their code words. The article explains how prisoners were using code words during their phone calls to set up conversations with people on the 'outside' they were not supposed to be talking to.

            I am one of those that criticised "coffeegate" when it was  posted.  I even used it as a good example of a shill post.   What makes a post a good candidate  it for a shill post?   One of the goals  is to 'muddy the waters'. Shills  are very interested in introducing discourse  that takes an investigation  on a wild goose chase.  If it can also use it to ridicule, then that is even better .
           </p>
           <p>
            You have to consider that this is a day job for them . Which means that they can spend an extraordinary amount of time  developing an "angle of attack".
           </p>
           <p>
            Coffee gate  was An extremely  well researched post on an extremely flimsy premise.  One that was easy to ridicule,  and could be used against the pizzagate community.
           </p>
           <p>
            The above post is once again ticking off all of my boxes.  But I will give even further reason to ignore "coffee-based" logic ;)  One of the  defining aspects of pizza gate is that we see a pattern of pizza restaurants being  involved in political events with ties to child abuse/paedophilia.  The symbolic language that is found on Instagram and tumblr and Facebook and Twitter  is littered with references to pizza ,  sex ,  children.
           </p>
           <p>
            Coffee maybe a  Euphemism  for sex after a night out,  but in terms of  representing the kind of sick activity that we are talking about here,  there is nothing noteworthy,  except  the desperateness  of paid opposition  to find cracks in pizza gate.

              I am a reasonable guy, and willing to change my mind given evidence opposite to my view. If you think I am wrong, what exactly makes you think that? I would maybe be able to agree that the poster isn't a shill, just an enthusiastic investigator. but then I would still say that the coffee angle is such a dead end. it doesn't have legs. do we have coffee houses implicated in pedophilia? any child molesting baristas to report? Dig into the orphanages, silsby, art galleries selling pedo themed art, there are SO MANY GOOD LEADS. do you see my point?

                Hi Utez, thank you for engaging in discussion. so here are my thoughts:
               </p>
               <p>
                So let me first say what I agree with:
               </p>
               <p>
                I agree that 90k is corruption money. he is buying access to Clinton. the "Pay to Play" principle
               </p>
               <p>
                I agree that all individuals mentioned probably have their fingers in various illegal activities. They might even be involved in sex trafficking, even child trafficking for all we know.
               </p>
               <p>
                having said that, my take on the above is that it is "just" normal corruption. people want access to power. they pay to get it. it can be a 10k a plate fundraiser, a 90k cup of coffee, a 500k donation to the clinton foundation. but it is not systematic prostitution and trafficking of children.
               </p>

            it seems like the sienfeld episode popularized 'coffee = sex' in the mainstram a bit earlier, it was aired in february 1991:

            *George is excited when he finds that he and Jerry are having dates on the same night. Both of their dates go well up to the point that they have to say goodnight. George's date Carol (Tory Polone) asks George to come up to her place for some coffee, but George tells her that he can't drink coffee at night because it "keeps [him] up". Once she leaves his car he realizes he made a mistake, as "coffee" is a euphemism for sex. *

             If "coffee" means sex, then I'd suggest that a lot of people don't know that.
            </p>
            <p>
             "Would you like to come up ......" is quite clear, however.  That's all that's needed.

             What's even harder to believe is that any female would have anything whatsoever to do with George.

            Ya I thought he wording in both sentences was odd.  * I hope to "collect" the coffee* instead of "pick up".  And then
            <em>
             "I am still holding your coffee"
            </em>
            ...instead of just saying "I still have your coffee from Cuba".  It could be an innocent email I just thought the wording was a little off.
           </p>
           <p>
            I also think Tony worded this email to his brother in a weird way.

             Why would a brother word it that way, why not say "if you're not busy I'll come by for coffee"?  "cup of coffee" is strange wording, how else would coffee be served?  "have me over" is also strange, why would his brother need to "have him over" implying issue an invitation... why wouldn't he just assume he can drop by? This all strikes me as code.

            Hmmm. It also can easily be read as a pay to play scheme, which we all know they are known for. They pay a crazy ass amount to get time with Prez, then get something they want out of it. The clintons are like gypsies that way. I'd be interested to backdate those visits vs what occurred afterwards wrt the businesses associated with these guys, or their countries. In other words, what were they paying him for?
           </p>
           <p>
            As for Norm, it seems like a reaction from the crowd that was pissed he brought up something that would be completely illegal if dug into, aka "pay to play", and that Dem friendly crowd was pissed and uncomfortable that he spotlighted it.

             I think people would have to go through the "coffee" emails to see the times people were asking to go for coffee.  If they are going for coffee around midnight then something else might be going on.

              Yes, I'd have to spend time looking through those. The BC incident seemed a bit more like pay to play, but could always also involve something else for those payments.

            for more on this story. Currenty in litigation in Southern District of New York/preet bharara involves untimely barbell death of UN director John Ashe &amp; human trafficking, payments of cash delivered to Long Island.... the "coffee" is probably code for macau prostitutes.
           </p>
           <p>
            EDITED to add, coffee as reference to sex goes back to Mae West, who did ads for a coffee brand, most of her scripts were censored for innuendo and double entrentre.
