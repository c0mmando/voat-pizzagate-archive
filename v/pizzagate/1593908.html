            For sure a option, like i said, do not know much about him. Just how the power families work in general over generations. The part that he was scheduled to be Joe his replacer made me think he is in same network/group. You do not want someone out of your "gang" to take over your "power". That he did not take the seat can be an indication from what you are stating. He for sure can/could be a good person. But in this file, all connected are at first suspect (in my private mind, will not just call them out for something i have no proof (yet)) and can later do to comments like yours and found facts be placed in unlikely involved or definitely not involved category.

            So I found an article dating to two years before beau's death referencing cancer on his wiki, it took me an entire 15 seconds to verify this author's claim is likely bs. This seems like flagrant subterfuge, have ppl researching some dead end lead bc we all know how creepy uncle joe is. Yeah he's a creep and yeah he could very well be implicated, but we have no evidence of that and this seems flimsy, other than an ice cream parlor catering to kids and well Biden.

             Again, this thread is not a focus on Joe at all and you're ignoring the heaps of other connections I provided. I understand we don't have evidence yet, which is why this sub-voat exists. You're acting like a shill and it's annoying me. I didn't even 'make a claim', I just presented some things I found and asked for help piecing them together.

              You sound like you have some MAJOR anger issues, you absolute nutcase. Just because people dont agree with you and present an alternative viewpoint, does not make them a 'shill.' The commentator Pokes, above, presented a valid argument and you just went for his jugular.

              Im guessing you have no friends and your family hates you. With good reason.

            The son of Joe Biden, who prosecuted one of the worst pedophiles in history is it not?
           </p>
           <p>
            I do not know details of his live. But for me, the prosecution could just have being a take-out of a competitor from "your" organisation. We all have seen creepy Biden, i do not think his son is saved from that kind of behavior in his youth.
           </p>
           <p>
            It is for me for more likely he was part of the global mafia network than that he was not. Only based on family and the mentioned prosecution knowledge and my (possible wrong) own connecting dots.

            I am not sure which side Beau Biden was on here, as he could have been compromised or he could have been a good guy who was getting too close. It looks like the case was obviously much bigger than one person from some of the actions. He had over 1,400 victims and many hours of tape. Was he taping this for himself or others? This is a quote from a WaPo piece (
            <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/morning-mix/wp/2015/06/01/beau-biden-prosecuted-one-of-the-worst-pedophiles-in-american-history/?utm_term=.dcd7ce10b793">
             https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/morning-mix/wp/2015/06/01/beau-biden-prosecuted-one-of-the-worst-pedophiles-in-american-history/?utm_term=.dcd7ce10b793)
            </a>
            ) about it:
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             Bradley’s public defenders opted to put on no case or witnesses, opting for a judge instead of a jury trial. The trial ended in a day.
            </p>
           </blockquote>
           <p>
            They did not want to have discovery or witnesses, which is usually the case for a larger conspiracy. When Beau purchased everything for $1, it could be to cover it up...or it could have been to dig deeper. Maybe he could have found more evidence implicating others? Either way, the appearance is that this whole case could very much be much bigger than a single perpetrator.

             I too am having a difficult time determining if Beau was involved in this, or against it. I feel like if he was taken out, it was because he knew too much and he was trying to do something to stop it. I want more information about what happened with the stuff Beau bought, especially since the source article has been removed.
            </p>
            <p>
             I also find it very hard to believe that one man was in this all alone.

            I haven't looked for any articles, but I was aware that he had cancer. It's why joe started "Moonshot 2020" - "Moonshot 2020" is why I really want to like joe, but since no one knows what it is, he did a really crappy job of promoting something that could save tons of lives.

               no. It was aids, dipshit. Not saying the cancer gun doesn't exist, but not correct here.

               the quick cancer is probably a real thing. Bob Marley claimed to be poisoned with it in his shoe. I absolutely think that "quick cancer deaths" should be considered suspicious. Please look into death of Katherine McCarty in many Podesta emails., assistant to dean at Georgetown law. Talking to potus on phone, months later dead of cancer...aged 45. not suspicious at all... What did she know????

                This isn't so much that he mysteriously got cancer, they're claiming he had it for a while but I can't find a previous record of it. Like it said he went through treatments and all that.

            There are a couple of high profile Pedo cases Beau was involved in. The Dupont one was particularly revealing. I would say he was compromised in that case, Dupont got off the hook and he died shortly after.

             the website

            People have found a lot of connections between this investigation and Rehoboth Beach and Beau himself personally made sure that everything in Bradleys storage locker was destroyed.

            My first thinking is, he is moved to a undisclosed Japanese island. He also can be sacrificed/punished. Beau's family still lives in the US? If not, first option could be it, if do live in US i think he is dead.

                Could be, but if you look for evidence that he was sick, while he was not, you can look until 2050 and find nothing. While IF his family is moved to another country, new clues can come very fast. If not moved, that part is fast and easy investigated until that part and can be placed under "unlikely" until later maybe new clues come to surface to look again at that possibility.

            The charity seems to have been a consequence of that prosecution so I dunno if its an independent piece of evidence. You'll have to dig more than that into his past for it to gain any views here.  Biden awkwardly grabbed that milf too, and he's known to be just a dipshit in general.

             The joe thing wasn't a huge deal for me and I dumped investigating it to look at Beau. There is a lot of footage and photos with him grabbing people weird, so it's just something to be aware of.
            </p>
            <p>
             The main thing I'm having an issue with right now is why I can't find anything saying Beau had cancer before he died.

              Why do you presume that you necessarily would? People can and sometimes do keep that sort of thing private. Nor did you do your homework, because this would appear to be from a couple of years before his death and is one of the footnoted links in his wiki.

               The articles don't seem to act like it's a shock or surprise that this happened, plus he was a prominent figure himself, so I find it odd he was able to keep such a serious thing a secret.
              </p>
              <p>
               I also acknowledged I needed help, so I'd appreciate some actual work instead of acting condescending to me. That article is interesting, but it talks about how Beau seems okay when he was last seen and he's "awaiting results", literally nothing there that he actually had it or went through treatment. I definitely encourage you to keep looking though, because that's what I'm after.
