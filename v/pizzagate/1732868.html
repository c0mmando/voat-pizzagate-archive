            I always thought it was weird that this woman who was seen as a bit mentally ill/unstable (remember blood vials with former husband Billy Bob Thorton and her dad's emotional plea for her to get help

            ), then all of the sudden she becomes this wonderful stable mother to a bunch of kids and she is on magazine cover after magazine cover portrayed as the ideal mom.  Never made sense to me.

             EXACTLY. Upvoat for you! She French kissed her brother an was a complete whack job and overnight it all changed. It shows the power of the press in pushing a narrative. And this "work" she did for the UN helped enormously. Don't know why people still give credit to that horrendous organization, but they do. I even saw a fictionalized cover story for why she rammed her tongue down the back of her brother's throat. Now the narrative is that it was a health concern. Yup, when you get upset about a health scare, the first thing you do is grab a sibling and suck tongue. So stupid ... then there's her drinking. According to the maid, all she does is drink in the shower and cry. At the end of the day, that's what you're left with ... explaining to yourself for why you feel so empty inside.

              Oh yeah, I forgot about her weird relationship with her brother and her connection to the UN.  Hmmmm   I Googled her and her brother and this popped up.

              Wow, I forgot how really really messed-up she was.  In the article she says 'I was a member of a group called the Kissy Girls. I was very sexual in kindergarten,' she told OK! Magazine in 2007.  'I created a game where I would kiss the boys and give them cooties. Then we would make out and we would take our clothes off. I got in a lot of trouble!' 
Whaaaaat???!!  Who is sexual in kindergarten???  Yeah it is pretty amazing how she went from cray cray to the picture of stability and motherhood.

                Thanks!  Yeah, I didn't know about the kindergarten thing either until just now.  It is looking more like MK.  Kind of reminds me of Miley.  Both go off the deep end and both of their dads publicly express their concerns for their daughters well being.

                 Yes, yes! Rhianna, too. They all hate their fathers. I think the MK thing exploits whatever weakness there is in the psychological framework. With them it's their fathers. Britney I don't know about. I know she always talks about her mother. But Miley ... she's a real mess. I'm sure there's a real story to her being thrown off The Voice other than her being the world's worst coach. She really is a putz.

                   Yeah, it was announced at the beginning she had a two year deal, same as Alicia. They blamed it on her being "unhappy" about fights with Adam Levine. I don't doubt that he hated her, but she was just really bad ... really, really bad.

            Evidently, stars are not expected to follow the same rules as the non-Cannibal Elite follow. Anyone else would be questioned and given a litmus test as to whether their testimony held to what a reasonable person should or shouldn't know, but the Cannibal Elites can just use the "star" excuse.

            This is why some of them go off the deep end, sometimes never to return, eg Brittany Spears, Amanda Bynes, Miley Cyrus, Mariah Carey, Toni Braxton

            Eva, it's clear to me that you have no problem just making things up, like creating a statistic that my anecdotal information is worth only about 15% of yours.
           </p>
           <p>
            Now I have to respond from my position as a Christian, and say that as the Bible teaches, it's easy for people to be great people the more they have. And don't think in terms of some people in America suffer more than others, but that by and large all Americans get many of their most basic needs met in ways that many other people don't. Many people get war on top of disease, no opportunity for work, never tasting what we would consider one really good-tasting meal in their lives, malnutrition, deaths of most of their family, and no clean drinking water and dealing with harsh, uncomfortable elements, without any releases like entertainment or anything our society would think of as fun. Until all those things have been taken away from people, you don't know what they are like.
           </p>
           <p>
            And on "whining about superficial people being superficial," that comment of yours shows how unserious you are about having an honest conversation. As I said, and will repeat one more time, differences in looks translate into real social advantages and disadvantages, as numerous studies have shown. Society treats more attractive people better than average, and less attractive people worse than average in just about every way you can think of. This is an article discussing just a few of those ways:

            Very interesting. Thanks for your insight. I'm pretty certain though that sexual abuse plays a role in confusing sexual identity, also serves to turn them off of the gender that abused them so they switch teams, i heard that quite a few times among lesbians who were abused when younger. I'm not saying its the norm but it is a factor in some of them. I also forgot to add one of those people i mentioned claims it for attention i think lol to differentiate themselves from others, an ego insecurity construct. but not sure how common that is, but she's one of those ones who's always trying to shock people and have some drama to talk about.

            She really said that? Shiloh is going to be as messed up as she is. Instead of being allowed to adopt children, there should be a court order demanding she stay at least ten miles from them.

            All your opinion, Eva, not backed with hard evidence. You say "after a decade of interacting with dozens of trans folks." So how would you happen to know dozens in one decade? And does "interacting" actually mean knowing them well, meaning how it really counts, when you are mutually depending on each other? I've known a number, but two well, and one especially well. One, a male who wanted to be female, was like a family friend I stayed with for a time after an abusive parent essentially robbed me of everything and I was advised by a counselor to the homeless to avoid homeless shelters at all costs. Then I did eventually go to a homeless shelter, and there I met the other, a female taking hormone treatments and identifying as male. After leaving the shelter, I lent the woman a certain amount of money, and also tried to encourage her to enjoy the simple things in life regardless of her personal troubles. And yes, after knowing these people, especially the man, and meeting others, and studying the claims about them, I have to reject the claims you make. Describing my beliefs as "socially conditioned phobias" is an easy way to dismiss them, because that denigrates my motives, but what you say is completely untrue. I also have to add that over time I came to see that there were forces in my family that were pushing me, at least somewhat, towards becoming transgender, although I didn't.

            If you want to personally pretend that someone else is what they aren't, then that is on you. But don't force that on other people when it isn't the truth. As I mentioned here in another post, I ended up not being so much like my own sex in appearance likely due to hormonal problems (I'm not ever confused with the opposite sex, but turned out "less than average"). That affected my physical attractiveness, which has been a handicap. Do you know how many social benefits go to the physically attractive and how on the other hand people suffer hardships due to being less attractive? Despite years of anguish over it, especially when I was young, and actually suffering a lot of loss of opportunity due to it, I came to accept it as God's will and plan for my life, and to truly appreciate it for all the spiritually good things it has done for me and my life. But should I rethink this, in light of your arguments? Perhaps what we should do, given all less attractive people suffer, is to ban discrimination on the basis of attractiveness. If you can stand there and have your picture taken, you be able to be a model and not be denied such a job no matter what you look like. And other people should be legally forced to tell you that you are physically beautiful, even if you're not. Forced, I say, to the point of ruining their lives if they try to refuse or protest it isn't true. Don't you think that would be to the benefit of people who are less attractive, to even an uneven playing field? And I mean, everyone should fear not giving everyone else the exact message that they are physically beautiful, not just "beautiful within." What's more, the more physically attractive people should be treated as unattractive, and given the last shot at things like modeling jobs and employment in general because they have such an unfair advantage.

            Absolutely untrue. It might be settled for you everywhere else, but it isn't for a great many other people. Again, if you want to share in someone's fantasy, that's on you. But a fantasy is always a fantasy. It is what it is. A number of people pretending something doesn't make it true. I asked that woman who was taking hormones from a public university medical group, "what about the possible medical risks?" and she answered, "what risks?" How does unnaturally taking hormones, against your own sex, potentially affect your health? They're systemic. Your body has all sorts of systems to maintain healthy functioning, including fighting disease. How does introducing hormones at levels powerful enough to induce some opposite sex features possibly affect a person's health, especially over decades? Well, nobody really cares to know, or treat these people as real bodies rather than mere states of mind.

            It seems to me that different narratives are currently being tested in MSM from different parties and by different angles which could either work as a side track, distraction or otherwise for them to keep the hand on revelations thant cannot be hushed.

            It's not easy to make out. There are papers on developing adoption big money, stories of mass abuse in catholic church. It looks like all the factions that have dirt on their hands are trying to wipe it on others' shoulders.....................

             Oh, I'm sure these are little tests. I haven't read the comments on that link I posted, but I'm sure they have the paid shills writing how wonderful she is and how she couldn't possibly be connected to any of what these two people did, but she was "a friend" of one of those people! Doesn't that mean she's involved and knew?

            Reaching? In what sense ... ? She's speaking ... those are her words. And the thing is that they can't claim it isn't her because they've been claiming copyright infringement.

            The Vietnam one was not official, as adopted babies have to have health checks at only 1 authorised place, International SOS.  I worked there and confirm that Angelina Jolie did not follow that process.

            I don't know if i can get personally behind that one. Just because of my cultural roots. Some of our peaceful and spiritual tribes (like every race we are different among tribes, some were war mongering too), anyway my regional tribe had an ancient belief they were called two-spirit people, the spirit of a man and a woman and they were considered very special and rare. But only that they developed organically and without corruption by the tribe, they knew they had to be Gods creation too. I know my tribe was good, peaceful, took only what they needed from the land and nothing more, showed respect and honor to animals they had to kill for survival, ultimate priorities above all else were children and elders, then  protecting the women. I know in my soul we were people of the creator. However modern times, there are way to many walking around to be an organic development. Knowing people, some evil ones corrupted others into it through their own sexual depravity and hang ups. And even more, clever political degenerates used them as "social" shield to corrupt even more into unnaturally occurring and hides behind their banner so people can't point it out without being called ignorant and discriminatory. Like in my tribe. I know of 10 gay people in my hometown, i can only think of 1 being a decent normal person who happens to be lesbian. She's honorable, a hard worker and they have a strong family unit (no kids for her, i mean their sisters, dad,mom, brothers etc). They are a good family, help others and spread happiness and good feelings in others. The rest of the other 9 are pretty screwy, have sexual abuse in their history and dysfunctional families.

            If you are suggesting I'm a shit person with phobias you're sadly mistaken. What it sounds like to me is you are a typical SJW type who is probably an Atheist and had no concept of God and the social order that he set forth when he created the world. Get right with God lady. The Bible is true and Jesus Christ is the savior. There is nothing new under the sun and Satan has been twisting our reality into the opposite of what was intended since day one to send people like you and I to hell. There is no excuse for a parent to transgender their young daughter or son just because they think they feel different than the way they were born. You watch too much TV you try too hard to be hip and they fed you some bullshit and you fell for it.

             And as far as that pic of Angelina from 1977 goes, nice try. Why doesn't she have her own children and why does she have her beasts lopped off and why does she confess to sacrificing animals in satanic rituals on video I might add! The world isn't what you see on TV.

            I meant that I don't care about surfaces like bodytypes. But let`s not disrupt this discussion about adoptions. However: Thank you.

            I know this stuff happens, but it's weird seeing a celebrity actually saying it when she thinks nobody is watching. It amazes me that someone would sell their soul to the devil so they can have fame. I bet a lot of people later ask themselves "Was it worth it?". Kanye West comes to my mind. These people are so brainwashed. So sad.

            I knew it, hope eyes are on Charlize and Madonna as well. Those are two that I feel something seems amiss with. Especially if you take into account when a story was ran about a child screaming in the middle of the night in the hills. She and Sean Penn were out there with the boy she adopted. You ever see how she dresses the child?

                TMZ I think it was ran the article about neighbors calling police because of a child's screams middle of the night. Investigated, and Charlize and Penn were in some alley or pathway, middle of the night, screaming child. They explained it away and if I remember right, nothing more was said about it. Well, besides gossip forums.
               </p>
               <p>
                I'd look up the article and post it, but for some odd reason that damn site leaves my computer lagging, sometimes crashes right out. Her pics of him in Halloween costumes...I think he was a princess fairy this last year..one of them. I just get weird vibes. I'd always gotten douche chills abt. Sean Penn. Wasn't til' the screaming child at night til I side eyed Charlize (guess it was really loud screeching type, which is why cops were called)
               </p>

                They also adopt from poor countries virtue signaling. "I couldn't POSSIBLY be bad, look at what I do for the country, the poor and adopted babies" They're not good enough actors anymore. Every movie is just wrecked for me. I can't watch anything like normal people. Nope...that's got Jolie in it, not watching her.
               </p>
               <p>
                I'm in the midst of a pretty decent hold onto a boycott of hollyweird movies though. No more theaters, and err cautiously with my squawkbox. They are huge hypocrites, but people worship them more than themselves. It's cult like with some, like Jolie is a great example.
               </p>
               <p>
                Wonder what agency they use? Wonder if anyone could hack that up like Hillary hacked up a lung...

                 Thanks for this. I'll try to follow up on it and see what I can find. The closest thing to the underbelly of what goes on in the household was a statement by the maid. She said it was a pig sty inside the home with pizza boxes and empty alcohol bottles everywhere. It was quite damning, but nothing was ever followed up on it even though it was reported that Ms. Angelina Jolie was always drunk. And they allow her to adopt kids ...

                  Then ya got madonna saying she wants to blow up the wh. They're too bold for me, it's getting hard to wait. I'm seeing busts. And if I learned anything watching designated survivor...they need amazing evidence, and cooperation. I hope our patience is rewarded. There was a time in history that would not be the case. I was just reading some family stories, and if someone did something bad, they didn't involve the law (sheriff). They just made them disappear. People did that all the time then, lord knows, it's why it was hard to track down my family. Some of them were in famous KY feuds (now I see why my fam is the way it is, lol) Sometimes I wish it were still appropriate to do this, seems it'd be good for city budgets. We already know who the scum in our communities are. Hollyweird first....that place feels dark. I remember visiting socal. I loved San Diego (at the time, now I don't know if I would). L.A. just had this heavy feeling that felt like Detroit feels when you pass through the part of town with cars on blocks everywhere. It must be contained there. James Woods better be the hero there, cause he's the hero we need right now. He gives me hope there's good to be spared there.

                   I want our justice system to prevail. Right now, it's infiltrated by this scum, but when it works, it's a beautiful thing.

                   I don't hold out much hope, but then again, the evidence is there. You know it is, everyone knows it is. Hell, they know it is! It's just a matter of getting it into the right hands. The thing is that we can't give up trying. Even if it's posting on the web, it's moving towards the goal of this being exposed and the Cannibal Elite winding up in jail.

                   Trump and his cabinet/justice system have their hands full, but think what it'll be like to pick up a paper and see the headline, "GUILTY," and under it the pics of Podesta (both of them), Alefantis, and The Cannibal Queen. Ahhhh, it keeps me going.

                    It's like the quote on The Godfather "I keep trying to get out, but they just keep pulling me back in" or something like that. Tis true. I'm not letting go. I'm staying within the law, a small taste of jail and I learned that even one night sucks. Hurting them, worse, doing away with them, not knowing the children they've fucked for life are. A condition of ANY immunity given out, disclose ALL places you went, or know of kids being held.

                      I feel like someone is gonna have to go Gravano to take them down. Even then Gravano rollin' only crippled the mafia, and that was huge. Gotta get em on RICO and build a case, that's my wish. Guiliani was the first to make the RICO work, and stick to Gotti. Makes me wonder if he's maybe up to something there. Could get em for life on that, I won't fuss over what it is, just so long as they all die in cells. I pray to all the good gods, and kek, and baby Jesus every day they catch and jail all of them. I'll build for free if they run out of room.

                     <p>
                      The worst should go to Gitmo, why close it down? Send em there to stay. Make it less cushy, no anything. No escape. I think there's so much going on in this, one hand has no idea what the other is up to. That is what works for them, compartmentalized. I think Comey knows more than he's saying, he looks like he's constipated and sick to the stomach lately. I think he, or McCabe know it all. Perhaps they turned their head, but the law does say accomplice is just as culpable.

                       Yeah, I still haven't made my mind up about Comey. This latest round of questioning re: Russian interference should tell me that he's a douchebag, but what if there's more going on. In other words, if there's an active investigation of pedos in Washington, he can't just bring that up. It may be why he's looking like a shill/poser/ahole lately, but who knows? He could be a good guy taking a lot of heat to put pedos away. Yes, they could get everyone on the RICO Act. It'd be WAY easier than to get them on the filthy, disgusting things they allegedly did to children. I mean, how are you going to get three-year-olds to say what was done to them? That's the problem. Children's testimony is easy to dismiss ... which is a shame.

                 Dude, fuck hollyweird! Pearl Jam was my favourite band for more than half my life, now I can never listen to their music again. Interestingly enough, it wasn't hard at all! It's like once you are awake, these distractions are no longer entertaining.

                  Yeah, the lyrics suddenly make a ton of sense. I listen to a few things still, New Orleans metal. I know the guys in the bands, and they're the sort that want to hurry up the DOTR. Their lyrics don't resonate in a bad way, but they're mostly all on homegrown labels. They got a taste of what the big labels WANT you to do, it's not about what the artist wants to do, it must fit a narrative. It's why they created their own. They said they make more money now. They get merch money plus the labels are fair.

                 <p>
                  Even books and authors. I believe Edgar Allan Poe was brought up as a known pedo. I didn't know that before this, now I look at this humongous collection I have, and find something else. I liked weird books, still do really (Burroughs Junky is probably one of the best I've read). I just keep waiting to hear the author I like was a diddler. It's all it takes, I can't enjoy anything they do anymore.

            There seems to be a preoccupation with children of color and most definitely from Africa, unfortunately for from what I've heard is for the purity and ritual significance of their blood.

            Notice the recent fascination with twins as well, Madonna, Beyonce, Clooney. Its the metaphysical rebirth of the twin founders of Rome Romulus and Remus and the rise of the lycans (by means of a 'bestial' transformation by 'artistic' indoctrination, ie,  like abramovics 'fine art' and hollywoods 'entertainment')

             It really is scary to ponder what they're doing to these poor kids. On the surface, it seems like such a wonderful thing when it may being used for such depravity. I sort of want to know exactly what's going on and sort of don't. It's just too chilling to hear what these children are being put through.

             Yes!  The twins.  I have written this before in comments.  They are all having twins.  Watch if they are identical.  They are valuable in some way.  This stuff makes me sick.  Also, yes Madonna is a freak.  She has been brainwashed and if you look at her in that picture she is starting to look like the Rothschilds.  Yuck.

Yes and there's Theron, Bullock.  These people seem to be told by someone who to adopt I think.

            Eva, that just isn't the case. Your response is made up of different narratives that are popular, different judgments that aren't true in themselves. The first inaccurately minimizes what one's sex is. It's not just something "inside people's underwear," that is, hidden away and a private inconsequential matter. One's physiological sex is very real to one oneself and important to one's relations with other people. Even with taking hormones starting in adolescence, an extremely risky thing to do and in which the children doing it today are guinea pigs, isn't going to change the physiology that much. The organs, skeletons and muscles of men and women are different. This is why the medical community has realized that doing medical studies only on men, and believing the results were the same for women, as they did for decades, has been a huge mistake. Then, on the other side, it is against freedom of one's conscience for the government to try to compel people to deny reality - that is, this physical reality of the sexes (of course, authorities like physicians and law enforcement still get to go by reality). It's a dangerous overreach of government to force adults to play "let's pretend" what's untrue is true, and to be participants in someone else's fantasy. Where does the line get drawn after that? Medical science shows that men and women are physiologically very different, yet that reality isn't to be upheld? That opens the door to forcing people with the full force of the law to accept that black is white and up is down, if some rationale can be found for it, and you can believe one always can be. That's what I've seen now over a number of decades. Take a look at this video from a Christian group in which secular university students were interviewed on identity. They are willing to accept that one person can identify as almost anything:

              Fuck him. I used to worship politicians. I realized at the ripe age of 20 that they're mostly frauds. Then at ~25, I realized that many in the uppermost levels of these freaks literally eat people, bath in blood, etc.

            Remember the rumors about Chief Justice John Roberts being blackmailed about something being hinky about the children he adopted, which prompted him to rewrite Obamacare?  Justice Kennedy and he supposedly had a very heated semi-public argument about his switch in position.  So, yes, very well may be tip of the iceberg.

             Angelina chooses children like breeds of dogs, or an eclectic collection of human chachki, or a line of designer purses.  She said she'd like one of 'each' religion, color...etc., so the agnostic/atheist parents take the kids to various churches so the kids can take their pick while not living the tenets of any faith at all, a spiritual junk food diet if you will, food coloring and artificial flavors, while living in a neurotic libtard Hollywood commune.

            Well, according to the UN's new regulations,  an orphan can be a child that still has a living parent.  Actually, a country can declare a kid an orphan if they do not think the kid has "proper" parenting.
            <br/>
            "What is an orphan?  A common assumption is the belief or definition that an orphan is a child who both parents have died.  Another frequent position or definition is that an orphan is a child who lives in an orphanage.  Both of these definitions are accurate, but there is more.  When we examine the world and discuss the needs related to orphans there are more important factors to include in the definition.  Bethany Christian Services points out the reality that the majority of the world’s orphans have families.  Have families?  This is not something that holds to the common beliefs or definitions of what an orphan is.  
The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language (4th cd.), defines “orphan” in the following ways:
A child whose parents are dead.
A child who has been deprived of parental care and has not been adopted . . . 
One that lacks support, supervision, or care."
           </p>

             I know, it's sick, right? And all this has been going on right under our noses! I think it's the lauding in the press that throws suspicion off. If the press says they're wonderful, they must be wonderful.

            It's funny how I used to wonder what made a young beautiful woman mutilate her skin like that. It was back then when I was so naive! My girlfriend would call her nuts. My mum called her a loonie. Now I know the unswer! And I know why she is adopting children from third world countries!!!!!! She is doing bidding for her masters.

               Point taken, just trying to keep a balance. I know some (attractive and not so attractive) girls who do this, usually depression, stemming from other various issues. I haven't looked much into the topic (Illuminati celebs and cuttings) so I couldn't speak as one that's well informed on the subject.

             I was originally thinking she was conned or lied into it and realized she was used as a patsy for the BRCA promotion, she seemed to go downhill fast after that. But probably something more to it, i agree she's creepy and dark.

              Remember how she and Billy Bob used to keep each others blood in a vile around their neck? And i forget where i read but think it was a gossip or tabloid article that Brad Pitt had shared with someone in confidence who then leaked that she was so freaky and into blood play during sex among other things.  Plus theres that movie she directed (i think her directorial debut) "the land of blood and honey" which of course is a play off of the land of milk and honey which is actually yummy food .... yuck... f'ing freakizoid. And you cant tell me her brother isnt a satanist if you see a picture - just like Nicolas Cages son and Billy Ray Cyrus's son and Mileys brother... they all look the same. Hmmm and theyre all talentless hacks that rose to stardom in the heavily illuminati/Satanic influenced  entertainment industry! Yep, i guess it is  more expected than suprising.

            Wow, that fits in exactly with the videos on my thread about Podesta's fingers.  The videos describe how each and every actor/actress is 'chosen' to be the next big thing or the next person to win an Oscar. They are called to a room where they are anally and/or vaginally raped by masked people..  They are then 'in the club'. It also means that the bosses have something on them if they ever get out of line.

             science has shown that women merge the DNA of sex partners with their own.  I think that's why there is some sex stuff involved.  When those people screw her she takes a part other into her literally and permanently.  The same is true for the common cold, the virus holds the DNA of it's last victim and it merges with your own when you become infected.  It makes me wonder if they are trying to taint someone, like to destroy something good in them.

               Like I don't even care about the claims that the videos are making about cloning etc. Just the fact that Barack O Bama means something in Aramaic seems really unlikely. And what do you know! It's a direct reference to Satan in the bible lol "Lightening from Heaven". I am not even Christian and this stuff makes sense.

              That video is total FAIL.  Too much time spent on biblical quotes about the "white horse," showing the BLUE demonic steed at DIA.

            Guys you also have to understand. Angelina Jolie was transgendered before puberty. She was born a male and was "Sweded" into a woman. Satanists often raise their children in opposite gender, which is why there are a lot of transgenders nowadays. I didn't believe it at first but go to MRE3000 YouTube account and check out Ciara's video. Again, I though it was a joke but now I see them EVERYWHERE, all the big stars in the movies are trans. Both boys and girls, so before you go spanking it to any of them, make sure you transvestigate.

              lol. The Bush one is definitely suspect, but I could see the Tyka Nelson one. Especially considering all the circumstances leading up to his death.

              why would he be crazy? i don't think it's crazy at all. i think it's pretty standard to think that if it's possible, they will do it.

             K, so people believe mre3000 when he says it but not me......
            </p>
            <p>
             MrE might be shill. He misses all sorts of important aspects when doing his transvestigations.
            </p>
            <p>
             Edit: to be more specific, he misses the aspect that the reason so many young people these days are faggots and trannies and degenerate shitty people, is all a part of this transgender satanist agenda.
            </p>
            <p>
             Edit2: MRE3000 does now mention the part of the conspiracy that they are trying to turn us all homo and tranny.

              I have heard that before, but I disagree because in his most recent video he mentioned that exactly. And it's almost understood, he comes from it from the angle that satanists are trying to change the human genome so they can corrupt humanity so Gods creation is no longer what he intended. (or at least that's how he explained it to me.)

               My mistake then, I haven't been keeping up with his videos but I know in the past he wouldn't come right out and say that they were doing this to cause people to turn gay and transgender.

             I can't get used to this idea. Don't say, couldn't be right but what makes me always doubt those allegations is that the only evidence is body features. I am a woman with "manly" features. I don't have a real waist for example and I have wide shoulders and big hands. I would like to get more informations on that. Maybe like how many of them are Foster Parents or other informations which could confirm this thesis?!

              I have something of a similar issue and that happens naturally sometimes. During adolescence, the body's production of hormones determines how manly or womanly someone looks. For women, the more exposure to estrogen one gets, the more feminine her features will turn out. The amount varies from woman to woman, and women who get less, perhaps because something in their reproductive system isn't working quite properly, will look less feminine than the norm. All this is why adults who believe that a person can be "a man trapped in a woman's body," or vice versa, approve of giving children both hormone blockers and hormone treatments to make them develop the features of the opposite sex.

              I think that is a good indicator. Long arms are kind of a good way to tell and very square shoulders.
