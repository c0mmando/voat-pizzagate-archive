            <p>
             GOOGLE "MISSING BLACK CHILDREN" and then figure out how many come home? Its a national epidemic folks

            Limited Hangouts are long-term places where moron's go and are fed bile. LH is a Russian program that the CIA embraced. Wiki &amp; Alex-Jones are LH. Any place where 'conspiracy-theorists' are fed bile ( aliens, ... ) are limited hangouts.
           </p>
           <p>
            The entire 'alt-right' narrative is a limited hangout, Seaman, MILO, Alefantis are all paid actor NEO-CON/LIB fuckboy sodomist pimps. Alex-Jones 20+ years in the show, new faces are tomorrow's Alex-Jones, faggots in your face to worship, like Snowden, metro-sexual white-boys who are as gay as a 3 dollar bill. Cool 2 be Gay, paid by SOROS

            Sad for WIKI once upon a time, wiki was seen as fair &amp; balanced, now its a LH for TRUE-MSM ( blue pill people ), 'alt-right' is red-pill, all are LH. There is no reality other than elite people raising cattle to be fucked, eaten, bled and rented.

            Lol wikipedia isn't a person. It's a pretty transparent collective group-effort to show you what the current thinking is. If the current mass consensus is wrong, wikipedia will be wrong. Much like a democracy, the crowd can be wrong, but it has its strengths.
           </p>
           <p>
            Wiki has a policy not to give undue attention to "fringe policies" and instead favors the most reputable sources and prevailing opinions, so esoteric truths (like conspiracies) are poorly represented. You should look at how wikipedia works and familiarize yourself with the rules because you seem to think that it's more opinion-driven than it is. It's also very transparent. You can see who edited every word out and why, what rule was broken, challenge it, etc. You can see the user's entire history, or if they aren't signed up it'll display their IP address.

            <p>
             The fact that Wikipedia is ONLY PROVIDING the MSM narrative is telling. It's as if they were OWNED by MSM, and who owns MSM? The military industrial complex.
            </p>

             Who owns worldwide child sex trafficking? (CIA), and that my friends is why Wikipedia is biasing their truth towards the status-quo elite who OWN the USA.

            Absolutely. Wikipedia is an attempt to control all general information and constantly revise it in the light of whatever it is that they want general knowledge to consist of at any particular time. For example, just today, David Seaman reported that they have revised his entry in order to make his professional background in journalism disappear. It is damn near impossible to revise a Wikipedia entry if you seek to include information they want suppressed. Many have tried and all have failed.

             Wikipedia  Has Forever Destroyed their credibility. Nobody should ever again publicly say with a straight face they use WikiPedia as a reference.
            </p>
            <p>
             What they have done is made Wikipedia into an Oracle of Truth, Approved by the State. If its in Wikipedia its real, if its NOT then its fake. 100% part of the pedophile cover-up.

             Wiki doesn't say much about "Limited Hangout", just that its a Russian Creation.
            </p>
            <p>
             But then you go to "Propaganda" and you hit the mother-load on Wiki ...
            </p>
            <p>
             Propaganda is "information, especially of a biased or misleading nature, used to promote a political cause or point of view" (Oxford Online Dictionaries[1]). Propaganda is often associated with the psychological mechanisms of influencing and altering the attitude of a population toward a specific cause, position or political agenda in an effort to form a consensus to a standard set of belief patterns.[2]
            </p>
            <p>
             Propaganda is information that is not impartial and is used primarily to influence an audience and further an agenda, often by presenting facts selectively (perhaps lying by omission) to encourage a particular synthesis, or using loaded messages to produce an emotional rather than a rational response to the information presented.[2]
            </p>
            <p>
             Today the term propaganda is associated with a manipulative approach, but propaganda historically was a neutral descriptive term.[2][3]

            Have you tried? Why don't you go to Wikipedia and try to add some balance?
           </p>
           <p>
            Or better yet, why don't you defend the fact that there is not even an entry for 'pizzagate' the entire topic is verboten, and that my friend means that that it is Owned, just like Alex Jones is owned.

            Pizzagate
From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia
           </p>
           <p>
            Pizzagate may refer to:
           </p>
           <pre><code>Pizzagate, pizza thrown at former football manager and player Sir Alex Ferguson by an Arsenal Football Club player in the 2004 "Battle of the Buffet"
Pizzagate, a 2016 conspiracy theory falsely claiming the existence of a child trafficking ring involving members of the United States Democratic party and the restaurant Comet Ping Pong.
</code></pre>
           <hr/>
           <p>
            Let's see "pizzagate" is false, "Satanic Ritual Abuse" doesn't exist, and there are no missing children.
           </p>
           <hr/>
           <p>
            Wikipedia offer's ton's of truth on the history of Occult, on Pedophilia, Satanism, ... They just deny that Satanic Abuse exists in the USA/UK

            Well Scientology controls Wiki, and Scientology is CIA; Hell anybody here ever tried to post on
            <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/v/scientology">
             /v/scientology
            </a>
            the mod's there are 100% real-life Scientologists. 100% controlled.
           </p>
           <p>
            The fact that there is NO balanced conservation on Wikipedia is telling, they're losing all credibility. I used to enjoy Wikipedia, knowing that I always get all sides to the story.
           </p>
           <p>
            Now you only get the CIA-MSM viewpoint, its like you live in the GOOGLE-BUBBLE no matter where you go. Sad :(
           </p>
           <p>
            So they have destroyed Wikipedia in order to save the USA Empire. What next will they destroy.
           </p>
           <p>
            Reminds me of the Vietnam War where they said "In order to save a country, you must destroy it"; I think these people will destroy the USA in order to protect the elite satanic abuse of children.
