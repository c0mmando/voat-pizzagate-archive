            I think this thread highlights some of the issues with pizzagate, in that you can literally take any noun and assume it means something pedo-related, and then everything you read starts sounding like they're blatant pedophiles.  You're making these connections just based on a word that sounds pedoish because you're viewing everything through a lens of looking for pedophile materal, which skews your judgement and reason and makes it impossible to make objective deductions...it's your imagination running wild.
           </p>
           <p>
            This obviously (as previously stated) talking about a microphone, but just think about how many other pizzagate related "evidence" might be based on the same silly rationale.  I'm personally on the fence about pizzagate, am not a shill (look at my history i guess) and am a proponent of a lot of conspiracies, but I think a lot of the evidence around pizzagate is silly and downright stupid.
           </p>
           <p>
            That being said, the way the media has attacked it makes me think twice about it maybe being legitimate.

             I actually didn't believe pizzagate the first time i heard about it ,even when I saw the emails. What made me believe were the creepy insta pictures. You can't deny that ,that's evidence right there. 
And this is just a suggestion .it doesnt hurt to list all possible clues. Just because you dont the believe a certain thing it doest mean pizzagate (which so far has lots of real evidence tp support it) is bullshit  I'm just saying ,you can have your own opinion though

              Yeah, I'm not 100% convinced theres nothing to it....maybe like 50%?  Rich and powerful pedo rings definitely exist, they've been outed all over the world, including the UK and the US (ie the franklin credit union pedo ring), and the fact that it's connected to Hillary and child trafficking makes it seem even more likely.
             </p>
             <p>
              Honestly though, when I saw the instagram pictures I saw a gay guy who just thinks children are cute or something.  Some people have weird, non-sexual obsessions with children and it might be something more common among gay men?  I think the instagram pictures are actually a highlight of some of the lunacy around pizzagate because there's such obvious stretches of the imagination coming from those.  As as example: the picture of the child taped to the table that was touted as being some sort of bondage/rape thing when its so fucking obvious to any rational person, especially somebody with children, what was significant about the picture:  Children cant stop moving/touching/breaking shit on tables and the parent jokingly taped their hands down to stop them.
             </p>
             <p>
              I dunno man, a lot of the evidence is super silly and highlights a group of people who are likely people without children who are LOOKING for clandestine pedophile evidence and therefor are just connecting the dots on any and everything.

                Yeah I guess, but on it's own is this really significant?  Poor judgement, sure.  International child trafficking and pedo ring?  Probably not.

            Are you OK? Why so defensive. And no I didn't mention you. I was talking about someone else and I mentioned them aswell. I didn't think you were being negative but now you're acting weird. Stop trying to create an issue out of thin air and show up where people didn't mention you and say bullshit like "if you're talking about me.."

            Correct me if I'm wrong but no one has brought this up on voat . I brought this up thinking people probably didn't catch it as it was in the dnc leaks. I'm posting so people can add it to their investigation. If you can debunk it I'll be happy to know but if you just don't like because its old then ignore it please. Maybe others would find it useful

             Its a fair point we are all still collating this information. I would prefer old information be reposted a 1000 times over it getting left behind.
            </p>
            <p>
             That being said you need to also have something to bring to what you have posted, provide more information than the evidence provided, like for instance if you can link that phrase to something else.

            I don't remember mentioning you. Don't flatter yourself. And I don't believe I have broken any ruless that would make the mods delete my post. I just posted something that I found that no ones been talking about it here .I thought maybe people didn't catch because it was in the DNC leaks . Relax.

            Dudes, we need to stop jumping to conclusions. The MSM would love nothing more than to discredit us by pointing to us going down rat holes at every slightest mention of pizza or pasta or lollipops! We have to focus on getting hard evidence otherwise we'll just be swept under the rug.

            I can tell you this - I've been around AV and broadcast production my who life.  I have NEVER heard of a wireless (or wired) microphone being called a lollipop.  And I'm in the DC AO a well.  Not a regional thing.

            It's irrelevant because it is 1/4 years ago?  I'm not following your logic here. I made this post because I'm trying to help people see emails that have probably been overlooked. And this one is weird af and I don't see people talking about it. Dismissing it as "its just old" doesn't make sense. 
Enlighten me more maybe I'm missing something
