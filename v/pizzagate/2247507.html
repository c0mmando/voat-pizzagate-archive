<p>The inconspicuous estates around Buckingham North of London appears to be the largest Rothschild power center in the world, but the involvement of Jimmy Savile, references by Stanley Kubrick and further evidence point to the region as central to Rothschild dominance and MK Ultra -- which is named after nearby Milton Keynes.</p>

<li>Milton Keynes (colloquially known as MK) hosted a <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2017/03/10/spy-base-real-life-british-qs-collaborated-cia-hack-tvs-phones/">secretive GHCQ/CIA facility</a> and hosted Alan Turing during World War II.

<li>Secretive spy base known as Her Majesty’s Government Communications Centre (HMGCC) has ties to CIA, and is a fifteen minute drive to Milton Keynes and Bucks. </li>
<li>Eyes Wide Shut was filmed near or in Buckinghamshire, including in <a href="http://www.movie-locations.com/movies/e/eyeswide.html#.Wg8f5hNSxn4">Luton and Mentmore</a>. Many have cited his choice of location as hinting to Rothschild pedophile ring. </li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>The party interior, though, where Dr Bill Harford (Tom Cruise) attends to a guest after she ODs on a speedball, was filmed at Luton Hoo, Hotel, Golf and Spa, near Luton in Bedfordshire. A popular filming location, Luton Hoo was once open to the public but has since been turned into a luxury hotel.
Coincidentally, the exterior is another ‘Wayne Manor’ – Mentmore Towers, in the village of Mentmore, Buckinghamshire (seen in Christopher Nolan\'s Batman Begins as well as Terry Gilliam’s Brazil). It has stood empty for years while its future is decided – there are plans to convert it into a hotel.</p>

<li>This past week, I realized that Alefantis\' &quot;Bucks Fishing and Camping&quot; is a Rothschild reference, as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buckinghamshire">Bucks is the nickname for Buckinghamshire</a> and it is known for its country walks. <a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1679118">We already know very well that Alefantis has worked with the Rothschilds and is known to them</a>. The question is, what does Fishing and Camping mean to a Rothschild. </li>
<li>Jimmy Savile\'s involvement in the Stoke Mandeville hospital would not be so significant were it not a twenty minute drive from several Rothschild estates, as well as the Prime Minister\'s estate known as  &quot;Chequers&quot;, located only a few miles from the Hospital campus. <a href="https://www.docdroid.net/qhxvaBk/jimmy-savile-deep-cover-jim-fixed-it-for-warring-royals-proquest.pdf">Jimmy Savile used to spend Christmas there with Margaret Thatcher. </a></li>

</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>Savile, who presented Top of the Pops from its start in 1964 and also the final show in 2006, says his friendship with Thatcher and other prime ministers stemmed from the close proximity of Stoke Mandeville to Chequers. &quot;They are four miles apart and we are their neighbours,&quot; he said. &quot;We have a suite of rooms to take VIPs from Chequers. When Tony Blair had his heart trouble this is where he came.&quot;</p>

            It says in the article that Milton Keyes is to celebrate it's 50th Anniversary this year, since the article was from 2016.  Wonder what that was like unless it has not taken place yet.  I will try to remember to see if there was any news on that.

            Holy shit, that's less that an hour away from me. Do you think I could do something to further your research (idk how)? This just fucked me up real bad - very close to home.

             Here is what I just said to another member if you notice:  Keep your eyes and ears open.  Visit a pub or two.  That is a good place to hear the village gossip.  Might hear some interesting tidbits.

              Well... as much as I appreciate the advice I'm also under the legal drinking age here (I'm seventeen if you were wondering) and some pubs kick you out if you can't provide ID, which has happened to my sister in the past. I guess I'll try something like that then, thanks.

               It might be kind of expensive, especially for you, but going into one that has food and tables to eat, ordering a bowl of soup. Don't want to contribute to your delinquency!  Do not do anything that would endanger you either.  It's just not worth it. We have lost enough people to these sickos.  Also, remember that they are extremely dangerous.

               I believe the word in German is Hiern. I spoke German and that is what we called it.  So yes, MK does stand for Milton Keyes, I believe.

             Keep your eyes and ears open.  Visit a pub or two.  That is a good place to hear the village gossip.  Might hear some interesting tidbits.  You never know.  I am sure it is the top topic of discussion.

            Among the dead, Nathaniel  Charles Jacob Rothchild ?  Notice how there is no mention of any names of the purported 4 killed.  I'm just guessing and wishfully thinking too.

               I also posted an article in a site that now I have been told was disinfo, so we will have to wait and see.  I wonder if his wiki will post his new date of death.  I will be checking on and off.  I surely feel it was him, but who knows what the truth really is.  With their money any type of news can be bought.

            For anybody wondering, I was literally looking into the history of all of these manors last night, including the estate where the plane crash occurred. The helicopter crash today is completely coincidental.

              Agree.  Is it really, is the question.  There are always so many unanswered questions.  The key to solving it would just simply release all the information on the passengers.  Simple, but has not been done.  So yes, makes one wonder, Is it Really?

             interesting because a different story I read, it said that only one person was in the cesna. What is especially odd it that these two aircraft left from the same place 23 miles away, so were they flying together or  was one following the other?  You'd have to have two really bad pilots for both to not notice the other aircraft in that 23 miles. This sounds really fishy.
