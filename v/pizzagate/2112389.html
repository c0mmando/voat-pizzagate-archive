            People -- human beings -- fathers, grandfathers, uncles are responsible for this sexual abuse

           <p>
            not to mention, the idea that "anyone can be a woman" erases any real meaning to the word and puts women in danger when men are being introduced to their prisons and abuse shelters simply for "identifying" as women. more subjugation of the weaker classes. men need to stop standing idly by and letting this happen to our women.

           <p>
            What pigeon-holing and category are you imagining that would have been worse than having
to deny your homosexuality, being forced into the closet or into marriage with a female, and/or 
having no right to a job because you were gay?

           <p>

            seems to be under the delusion that females can't be pedophiles unless they are church nuns or are being coerced by satanist men which
            <a href="http://acidcow.com/pics/50229-female-teachers-caught-sleeping-with-students-41.html">
             just isn't true.
            </a>
            , they just get under reported and swept under the rug. He also also doesn't want to acknowledge that feminism like affirmative action might have overshot the mark a bit and there are many instances these days where men are the repressed minority. I don't hold this against him however.some red pills are hard to swallow. many of them where very hard for me myself. I've always been a progressive/liberal. I was so far right I looped around a bit and no straddle the far right. I'm guess you could call me an 'extreme alt-centrist.' but fuck labels, I don't fit into any box. As for the trans thing, yeah.. as a gay I understand people don't always get to choose who/what they are and are attracted to... (unless you are blessed enough to come out bi, then you can just suppress the side you don't want) I don't doubt there are legit trans ppl, but the way society is handling it now is shit. yeah let kids wear what they want and play with the toys they want, but boy is boy and girl is girl. If they feel different from that they will know and be able to tell you when they are old enough to decide that. telling a confused 3y/o that will believe anything you say cause you are their parent that their sex is probably wrong, they just don't know it yet is just going to confuse them and cause issues... just like all these schools where some teacher reads trans propaganda books to preschoolers and terrify them sending them home crying to their pissed of parents.
           </p>
           <p>
            but then again, I also don't believe in lying to kids about the tooth fairy or santa clause either. santa is actually a good analogy for lots of the big lies of society. some people just want to believe the lies and can't handle having their beliefs in the magical wunderworld they live in shattered. 'santas not real, but don't try to tell the other kids, you will just make them cry' is how some issues must be handled with some people until they are at least open to the possibility.

             the biggest problem with the whole transgender thing is that there is no such thing as "being born in the wrong body." it's called dysphoria, and it's a mental disorder, it is not indicative of reality. the only way sex relates to brain structure is because the brain is plastic, and each sex is socialized differently.
            </p>
            <p>
             like you said, kids should be able to wear what they want and play with the toys they want regardless of gender. it's actually quite regressive to claim that little Bobby is actually a girl just because he likes dolls.
            </p>
            <p>
             if someone grows up, and remains a dysphoric adult, they have the right to alter their body as they see fit and still receive the same basic human rights as everyone else, but this does not validate the delusion that "born in the wrong body" is a real thing that happens. it's not.

             What STUDIES show is that males are our sexual abusers of children -- and that they are heterosexual males.
            </p>
            <p>
             Those studies also show that females are not our sexual abusers of children, unless they are under the influence
of a heterosexual male.
            </p>
            <p>
             The majority of sexual abuse of children is INCEST - father rape of daughter or step-father rape of daughter ...

             Rather I see deep denial in your post that patriarchy exists at all in controlling our government and all of society --

             <p>
              In sociology, patriarchy is a social system in which males hold primary power and predominate in roles of political leadership, moral authority, social privilege and control of property. In the domain of the family, fathers or father-figures hold authority over women and children. Some patriarchal societies are also patrilineal, meaning that property and title are inherited by the male lineage.
             </p>
             <p>
              Historically, patriarchy has manifested itself in the social, legal, political, religious and economic organization of a range of different cultures.[1] Even if not explicitly defined to be by their own constitutions and laws, most contemporary societies are, in practice, patriarchal.[2]

             ... but it is interesting that you acknowledge that males are a "minority" controlling the majority population which is female.
            </p>
            <p>
             That can only be done through male violence and that has always been the case and continues to be the situation today
throughout the world.
            </p>
            <p>
             When we consider that women were barred from colleges and universities and thus professions
until the 1960's when "affirmative action" allowed entry for females, it's not surprising that males
are shocked to find that it is women who are our scholars and not males.  This is why they now cry
out for limitations on female entry.
            </p>
            <p>
             And, wow ... you're a "gay right winger" ...
and interesting that you even mention "bisexuality" because that is so little discussed anywhere.
            </p>
            <p>
             Why would it enter a parent's mind to suggest to their three year old that they are a gender NOT in accord
with their genitalia?  Would this be a husband, perhaps, just trying to create some family discord?
            </p>
            <p>
             On the contrary, it is these young children who know nothing of life and nothing of normal human 
sexuality, making clear that they are a different gender from what their parents believe them to be.
            </p>
            <p>
             There is enlightened society dealing with these issues and then there are some very uninformed posters
who can't deal with these issues at all.
            </p>
            <p>
             And what does "boy is boy and girl is girl" actually mean to you?
            </p>
            <p>
             So back to the days when a girl couldn't be a doctor, or is it that you want to prevent a boy
from being a nurse?

              Simple, 'Boys have a pee pee and girls have a vagina' why does it need to be made more complicated than that? being a boy and liking girl stuff doesn't change your sex organs. We don't have to get rid of the biological sexes to git rid of unhealthy and needless gender stereotypes, just stop forcing boy = blue &amp; guns, girl = pink &amp;  dolls etc.

              because modern society now tells them to. There is a difference between letting a very young kid wear what they want and play with what they want than confusing them. kids that age will try very hard to please their parents. They shouldn't be put into the position of making such life altering decision of choosing what gender they are, until they actually understand what that means... like around the puberty years when they actually get their male/female hormones going.
             </p>
             <p>
              As for the rape of minors, females taking advantage of males is under reported. First of all because the male goes into the female normally so the female is assumed to be subservient.  if a young adult slept with a older female instead of people going exploitation!! they go, oh wow, you scored a couger, good job dude. In the law and order system when it comes to rape males and females are treated differently. This is a HUGE issue in colleges right now, do to policies enforced onto the schools by the federal government tied to aid money. and if you don't acknowledged this you are simply in denial. If males try to report being raped by a female they are often  ostracized and blown off, this effects the stats. There are zero shelters for male victims of sexual abuse, their are zero services to assist them with law enforcement or the courts. On the other hand if a female is rapped there is a whole system to help her through the process that assumes the guilt of the male from the beginning. In many cases false rape accusations against men are not even punished. when it is discovered the male is 'allowed' not to be punished for something he didn't do, and the female is let off with a verbal slap on the wrist, or in the most extreme cases a minor prison sentence of ~6 months
             </p>
             <p>
              Its like trusting crime statistics that say mexicans and blacks smoke more pot than whites in areas with stop and frisk where the cops search the blacks and mexicans for drugs on the street because of profiling, but let the professional looking whites go by unmolested. of course they will find a higher percentage of drugs on non whites, they are not even looking at the whites.
             </p>
             <p>
              As for the patriarcy that was totally true before I was born, and yeah is still totally true in the political field, which is dominated by the old guard crew, the demographics there haven't shifted. however, get into family court in most states (especially coasts) and the female is heavily favored. As an example, in my state if you have a verbal argument with someone, and the neighbors hear and call the police, they will come, and the male WILL goto jail, AND get a DV charge (which is an extremely serious charge here, it will fuck up your life for decades) unless the female practically begs the police not to and convinces them she should goto jail instead. they are mandated to arrest one person if they are called out for 'dv' period. The only way for the DV charge to not stick and jail time for the male to be freed if for the female refuses to show up at court. without witnesses they can't press charges, if the female shows up the court will compel them to testify against their roomate/lover. Trust me, I've been in the courtroom, and helped pay for the lawyers. Females also dominate in HR and have tons of power over the workplace.
             </p>
             <p>
              While there is a ton of truth in what you say, and I don't doubt you are correct in many instances, you deal to much in extremisms. Yes there are some remnants of the patriarcy, but there is also a matriarcy now, and they both intertwine with each other in different aspect of our society.  We are doing a terrible job at deleting gender biases, we are just making new biases in some areas in the other direction.
             </p>
             <p>
              Feminists will not make much progress, because these days is not about male and female equality. its about 'male tears' and punishing us for the deeds of our ancestors.Gender equality won't be reach by oppressing men.
             </p>
             <p>
              also, I didn't say I was a right winger, i'm at best a 'progressive liberal libertarian', a mix of alt-right and alt-left, extreme centrist if you insist in putting a label on me... I didn't even vote for trump. (nor hillary before you go making assumptions). I was fully on the left before they lost all sense of nuance and went to the extreme of "all white males are evil racist nazis".
             </p>
             <p>
              I support female rights, but I also support not over doing it and still supporting the rights of males, apparently these days that makes me a misogynist and literally hitler.

              I am not debating this. but it still ignores that some are females, and a tiny fraction are even gay. it might be rare but it happens. The problem with your view, is it lets that minority off scot free. This is the same problem voaters on this site have when it comes to race.. yeah studies show that ~80 of blacks are 'below the average' when it comes to fitting into civilized society... but that doesn't mean we should oppress the ~20% who fit in and are decent honest productive members of society. Just because most pedos are straight males doesn't mean we should turn a blind eye to crimes committed by the rest, even if they are a rarity. if the police and courts turn a blind eyes because its 'only the men' than the exploitation will continue and youths will be damaged.

                Because anyone who does is called a backwards redneck misogynist, go do a search for the term MRA and read all the horrible things about them, and then realize they are mostly all just average joes who's only objective is to raise awareness about this issue.

                 the problem is that "Men's Rights Activists" largely developed in a reactionary sense
                 <em>
                  against
                 </em>
                 feminism, and because of this they don't seem to advocate
                 <em>
                  for men's rights
                 </em>
                 so much as they advocate
                 <em>
                  in opposition to women's.
                 </em>
                 i am all for men's rights, but it starts with us men. men are the perpetrators of almost all the violence in the world, against women, against children, animals, and against each other. battling women is not the way we are going to solve the problems in our own gender.

                  Modern third wave feminism that goes past equality and heads into reparations/revenge territory is what they have a problem with... and yes, wanting EQUAL right for men, means they are against special extra right for females by default, which is what their whole movement is about, bringing awareness to issues men have that society doesn't want to acknowledged. Yes, there are some extreme woman haters that attached themselves to the movement, but they are a reaction to the extreme man haters that joined the modern femnazi movement.

                  'all the violence in the world'.. so.. the good behaved men have to be second class citizens until we achieve world piece? It won't happen. The problem isn't the male sex, its the elites who exploit everyone and force them into violence just to survive, individually, and culturally, to maintain their vast wealth and power.. we will keep having problems as long as this us vs them attitude exists with the sexes.

                   another problem i have with MRAs is their hesitancy to call out the problem people in their movement vs their willingness to point out every flaw of womens' movements.

                  <p>
                   please don't strawman me. i did not say "good behaved men" have to be "second class citizens" nor did i imply anything like that. what i did state, pretty clearly, is that us "good behaved men" have a responsibility to reform and call out violent elements of our socialization in other men. women can't be the ones to do it; they're smaller and weaker.

            Gay is gay, there is no L BTQIABBQ, Lesbians, and 'bi's are just gay people. the whole 'gay agenda' was a hijacking of gays just wanting to be left alone and allowed to  be with people they loved, without society stoping them or murdering them for it.. It was literally about being able to see loved ones die in hospitals at the end of their lives and such. . the degenerates made it all about the 'gay lifestyle' which even lots of gays detest. source, am gay. fuck the queers for making everyone hate us and unable to tell the difference between a legit gay dude that just wants to cuddle on the beach with his bud and the fucking flaming degenerate pedos who want to have sex with anything that moves in public spaces and force their lack of self control down everyone throats.
           </p>
           <p>
            all the real gays ever wanted was to be able for two consenting adults to do what they want behind closed doors (in my case just cuddle, i don't even like fucking butt sex) and say good bye &amp; to comfort to each other in the hospital when they got old and sick.

             Yeah, I feel the same. Also, there is no homage paid to the fact that it took DECADES of courageous struggle by gay men and women who were not considered in any way "cool" or "trendy" and were in fact outcasts. Now it's like, "Look at me! I sprinkle testosterone/estrogen/fairy dust on my Cheerios every morning! Aren't I cool!"

              half of these kids are just heterosexuals who want to co-opt another group's struggle as their own for attention.

             <p>
              if you are a girl and you identify as a ~nonbinary agender~ or whatever suddenly you can claim you're an "oppressed queer person" even though you still only date natal men and you look like a girl.
             </p>
             <p>
              just as the "transgender women" are calling themselves lesbians, fucking up the gay rights movement, and trying to get gay women to sleep with them while convincing us all they're "oppressed LGBT" when they're obviously beta heterosexuals who think being a failed man = being a woman.

             That is something I've often thought about.  When someone is in hospital sick or dying, their gay partner cannot be admitted as they're not related.

             now the trannies are latching onto  the gay rights movement and advocating for their own form of conversion therapy on you guys, ie "lesbians who don't want trans """women""" (aka MEN with PENISES) are transphobic and evil!!"  transgender lesbians, lol, you mean
             <em>
              straight men
             </em>
             ?
            </p>
            <p>
             they attempt to apply the same logic towards gay men but less so, because trans "men" are women and women are generally less likely to act like flaming MRAs...but still. now apparently being gay is a choice, and you can "choose" to get over your "preferences" and to date a man with a pussy or a woman with a dick. it's Orwellian.

              Yeah, they are easy enough to avoid. As a gay guy I just avoid all wemons period. They are ALL SJW's, and if they try to get close to me (they always do, females always want to latch onto gay dude for some reason as fag hags, or whatever and convert them to boyfriends) I just trigger them. 'Did you hear? NSA had all killarys missing emails and the FBI refused to take them', they respond like "TRUMP CANT LEAD THIS CONTRY!! HES RACIISST", 'Yeah, I'm with you about I don't agree with all his policies fully, but hes doing a great job at locking up the pedos that are infiltrating our government, mayer of NY, AG of cali..' "REEEE!!!
              <em>

              ", I litterly had that exact exchange with a female who was around when I went to chill with a bud of mine this weekend.

               not all women are SJWs. many women are rational and intelligent. a lot of millenial women are SJWs, because they're young and immature, and women are socialized to 1. not trust their own perceptions and 2. accomodate others' feelings before their own. feminism was becoming too potent of a movement so they had to curtail it and make it all about men by introducing transgender "women" who, by the way, are a thousand times worse than any women i know, and are
               <em>
                males.
               </em>
              </p>
              <p>
               plenty of males act the way you described as well. i honestly don't know why you brought up natal women when my post was about transgenders, but i've noticed gay men love to bash women same as any straight men.

                The lesbian SJW's from my experience where the ones who pushed to open the gay movement up to all kinds of degeneracy and actually hurt the image of the non degenerate 'normie' gays who just want to be regular members of society and not special snowflakes. the 'fag hag' (not my term don't blame me) phenomenon I've personally experienced over and over in my own life. It's all inter related. Together the lesbians, fag hags (straight allies), and completely degenerate queers who seem to want nudity, bondage, anal, etc out in the public streets to become the norm hijacked the movement from low key down to earth gays like me who just want hospital visitations, civil union protections, and the like, but don't want to cram a 'lifestyle' down everyones throat. To be perfectly blunt i'm sick and tired of being lumped in with them. I'm not in the closet by any stretch, but people don't tend to figure it out untill someone else goes and tells them, and I notice the difference in how I'm perceived and treated.

                 i understand. it's unfair for all the peaceful normal citizens who just want peaceful normal lives.
                </p>
                <p>
                 the SJW movement is like a cult. i have some suspicions it was influenced by CIA cultural assassins in all the places of the internet where immature and insecure kids congregate (like Tumblr) a la the 1960's.
                </p>
                <p>
                 it's not necessarily women's fault that they're socialized to put everyone before themselves, hence the millenial women became raging SJWs, but i do think it's their resposibility as a class to address and change, which i personally see a lot of older feminists trying to do. older lesbian feminists are very anti-SJW.

               People like you are the reason why women have had enough of the 'gay rainbow' shite.  Generally, gay men hate women. That's why they call them 'fish'.   While their lesbian comrades nursed them by the thousands while they were dying of AIDS in the 1970s, gay men have done zilch for lesbians.  I'm against same-sex marriage because of gay doods like you.

                So its my fault a bunch of men couldn't keep diseased dicks outa their asses before I was even born, and desperate lonely virtu signaling females latched onto them? Bullshit. Just about every female I've met wants to latch on and 'change me' into something i'm not, so I can fit in with their social click and earn them 'is friends with gays' points, or convert me so i'll stick my dick in their nasty loose diseased pussy.. And don't start about all the stuff lesbians have done for gays and how gays do nothing for lesbians, thats bullshit. Lesbian is just a female gay, everything we fought for was for them also. but we are supposed to thank them for virtu signaling and sucking in all these degenerates into our movement? or for being batshit insane and pulling us into their emotional drama so they can have a chance at gay dick? please. I haven't always been like this, its from experience. I've had a fag hag in the past. a very good one actually, who didn't try to change who i was or be crazy insane. She was a down to earth grounded honest person, we ended up getting married under the stipulation that I wouldn't stick my dick in pussy so she would have to go get that from someone else if she wanted. just don't lie to me about it.  However females like her are very few and far between, and even then the relationships are temporary, cause inevitably the guys shes sleeping with get possessive and want full 'ownership' of their pussy. we ended up annulling our marriage so she could remarry, but obviously he wouldn't let her talk to me, because I was such a threat to his marriage having zero desire to ever fuck his wife and all.. so our friendship petered out after that.
               </p>
               <p>
                I just don't see the point in investing time and energy into relationships (the friendly kind, not the dickin kind) with females who are not going to accept their spot in the friendzone. especially with people who are usually polar opposites of me idealogicly, and usually crazy on top of that.
               </p>
               <p>
                but whatever, that makes me that bad guy. I'm a white male ;) so i guess i'm always the bad guy. thats muh privilege. It's wrong for me to get gay married to someone I love because I won't fuck a bitch I don't love.

                 You sound like you have a high opinion of yourself, thinking that every female you meet wants your dick in her 'nasty, loose, diseased pussy'.  You've just outed yourself as a woman-hating gay boy.

                  I'm not talking about every woman I meet, I don't hate womans. I have no problem dealing with them in professional environments. This discussion is about ongoing interpersonal relationships. The females I like, I have zero interest in, and have zero interest in me, so we go our separate ways and never meet, or think about each other again. I was being slightly hyperbolic when I said all, what I really mean was almost all. sorry for the mistake. I guess I am litterly hitler though for not leading people on and getting into a bunch of needless over emotional relationships i have no business being in.

                    I'm not going on a woman hating spree.. we actually seem to agree on a lot... nuance just doesn't exist on the internet and i'm not good at expressing myself in a way that doesn't trigger people and make them jump to conclusions about the extremism of my views when it comes to subjects like this... You want to talk about gays? I have plenty of bad things to say about males also ;) esp the ones who can't control their dicks and insist on sticking them in anything that moves. Honestly though I can't tell if transexuals are he's or she's.. there comes a point where they just turn into IT's in my mind. of course, you can't refer to anything in a gender nautral term in english without it being seen as a putdown, implaying they are a sub human object, which I do not mean. By It i just cna't tell what they are supposed to be? do we lump them with boys? girls? neither?

                     we do agree on a lot.  maybe you don't feel like you outright hate women, but your disdain for them shows when you talk about their bodies and other things the way you did. women aren't completely innocent, but i try to empathize with their development given their place as a class in society.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     for the most part, humans subtly detect gender through secondary sex characteristics. there are differences in cranial structure, skeletal structure, etc. that betray gender no matter how many hormones they pump themselves with. i believe in calling people the pronoun of their biological sex and i don't appreciate being forced by them to participate in their delusions. if transgender women were content just being transgender women and making their own place in society perhaps i'd have less of a problem with them, but trying to force their way into women's spaces and co-opt the term "woman," trying to indoctrinate everyone into post-modern gender theory bullshit, that's some shit i don't like.

            It's pretty much been brainwashed into white straight men for years. My 70 year old mom went into a local popular  taco place and she said it was her first experience in a transgender bathroom and it was disgustingly dirty .  She also said all the woman employees looked like men and vice versa . Only she called them by another name :)
