<p>Timeline: Poltergeist Series. Three incidents over a period of 5 years ranging from 1982 to summer of 1987. The crimes themselves occured in Simi Valley, California, Altadena, CA, and Chicago, Illinois. Suspects: Steven Spielberg. Since the Giardia infection happened in January 1987, we can assume that whoever raped her infected her during pre production, NOT while filming Rocky Road. Based on average incubation times for giardia, we can apply “microbial foresnics” via epidemiology to determine the approximate time of the pre-production rape. The timing was most likely in January 1987, meaning the crime that caused the infection most likely happened in Hollywood. The culprit was most likely asymptomatic.</p>
<p>Happy Days: Most Likely Suspects: Garry Marshall (dead), Bobby Hoffman (dead), Henry Winkler. The studio teacher is also suspect.</p>
<p>The Fatal Incident. Note that this incident is the START of Heather\'s fatal down turn rather than a quick death.</p>
<p>Location: On the set of Rocky Road. Hollywood, California.</p>
<p>Time: November 7, 1986. Heather\'s illness (the one that was covered up) first started to manifest around December 1986. The episode was released in May of 1987. She was on medication throughout filming of Poltergeist 3 as her condition worsened. Heather\'s health took its fatal downward spiral on 1/31/1988 before she died on 2/1988. The funeral was an open casket event on 2/5/1988. The &quot;skinning&quot; was most likely on the following night, with the casket being looted. This crime is fully possible because Heather was interred in an above ground mausolium according to accounts of those who attended the funeral.</p>
<p>Suspects (Rocky Road): Gene Abravaya, Arthur Annechario, Wesley Staples.</p>
<p>Cause of Death: Sepsis infection due to fecal impaction caused by repeated anal rapes.</p>
<p>Note: As I deduced regarding the Judith Barsi murder, &quot;The Best Lies are based on a Truth.&quot; seems to also apply to this case. Chrons was likely used as a cover up due to certain factual truths about it. Chrons is more common in females and it is very hard to detect unless you\'re a surgeon.</p>',

           For those who are new here, Heather O'Rourke was a child actress in the 70's and 80's who met a tragic end at the age of 12. Last year, a post by entylawyer on Crazy Days and Nights explained that Heather O'Rourke was basically raped after filming Rocky Road (which was cancelled after 6 episodes were quickly filmed in order to cover this incident up). This incident was the root cause of her death.

           The Giardia infection was identified in January 1987.
          </p>
          <p>
           Timeline: Poltergeist Series. Three incidents over a period of 5 years ranging from 1982 to summer of 1987. The crimes themselves occured in Simi Valley, California, Altadena, CA, and Chicago, Illinois. Suspects: Steven Spielberg. Since the Giardia infection happened in January 1987, we can assume that whoever raped her infected her during pre production, NOT while filming Rocky Road. Based on average incubation times for giardia, we can apply “microbial foresnics” via epidemiology to determine the approximate time of the pre-production rape. The timing was most likely in January 1987, meaning the crime that caused the infection most likely happened in Hollywood. The culprit was most likely asymptomatic.

           Happy Days: Most Likely Suspects: Garry Marshall (dead), Bobby Hoffman (dead), Henry Winkler. The studio teacher is also suspect.

           The Fatal Incident. Note that this incident is the START of Heather's fatal down turn rather than a quick death.

           Location: On the set of Rocky Road. Hollywood, California.

          <p>
           Time: November 7, 1986. Heather's illness (the one that was covered up) first started to manifest around December 1986. The episode was released in May of 1987. She was on medication throughout filming of Poltergeist 3 as her condition worsened. Heather's health took its fatal downward spiral on 1/31/1988 before she died on 2/1988. The funeral was an open casket event on 2/5/1988. The "skinning" was most likely on the following night, with the casket being looted. This crime is fully possible because Heather was interred in an above ground mausolium according to accounts of those who attended the funeral.
          </p>
          <p>
           Suspects (Rocky Road): Gene Abravaya, Arthur Annechario, Wesley Staples.
          </p>
          <p>
           Cause of Death: Sepsis infection due to fecal impaction caused by repeated anal rapes.
          </p>
          <p>
           Note: As I deduced regarding the Judith Barsi murder, "The Best Lies are based on a Truth." seems to also apply to this case. Chrons was likely used as a cover up due to certain factual truths about it. Chrons is more common in females and it is very hard to detect unless you're a surgeon.

             "An agent of the United States CIA is arrested in Morocco on drug-smuggling charges. The person behind the smuggling operation is CIA deputy director Burton Cooper, who hopes the resulting scandal will lead to the resignation of CIA Director Ross, and Cooper's promotion to Director. Ross is aware of Cooper's complicity, but when questioned by a special Senate committee about the arrest, Ross tells the committee that he has not reviewed all of the facts of the case. The committee orders a full inquiry and gives Ross 48 hours to present with the proper answers."

            , your tenacious work on this has been outstanding. :-)   However, could you possibly turn a couple of the toughest claims here into hotlinks directly to your previous research supporting them? I realize you've listed the links, but this thread would be stronger if you turned the key claims themselves into hyperlinks directly to their support. Notably, these claims:
           </p>
           <ul>
            <li>
             Drew Barrymore (a known Spielberg victim)
            </li>
            <li>
             The "skinning" was most likely on the following night, with the casket being looted. This crime is fully possible because Heather was interred in an above ground mausolium according to accounts of those who attended the funeral.
            </li>
            <li>
             Cause of Death: Sepsis infection due to fecal impaction caused by repeated anal rapes.
            </li>
           </ul>
           <p>
            Also, you might want to turn the following line into an enlarged bold headline so it jumps out at people, like this (click source for this comment and copypaste):
           </p>
           <h2>
            🚨 I still need some aid in identifying the studio tutor in Happy Days and the tutors for Poltergeist. Its like information for them has vanished. 🚨

            <p>
             The timing of the “body theft crime” is a deduction based on the most logical timing to avoid detection and get the product. Since the casket was interred above ground in a mausoliem (chapter 6), the crime could feasibly be commited in about 20 minutes. If one wanted to wear the victim’s skin as shoe leather, they would have to procure the product as fresh as possible. As early as possible to avoid dessication and mummification, which would make the skin more fragile due to losing its moisture.

            Great post, once again. Disturbing stuff.  When you say Drew is a known victim of Spielberg, what are you referring to?

               I was not aware of that either. I mean - I assumed she was someone's victim because of the early age she began drinking &amp; doing drugs. But I'm not familiar with her naming anyone publicly, or even going on record as having been a victim of sexual abuse. Do you have any links to additional information? And are you alleging Drew Barrymore was a victim of pedophlilia or Satanic Ritual Abuse (SRA)?

               The drug use at a yound age is a major red flag. Often a sign of sexual abuse.

                I personally just don't believe we have nearly enough to certainly say she's a victim of his. Drug abuse can be related but can also be due to many other factors

                 Fair point, 3141592653, but Drew will certainly still remain a person of interest due to her distinct proximity to SS and her subsequent downfall. Unless something drastically changes, even a sudden show of affection and gratitude towards SS would seem like a PR stunt, forced or unwittingly. At this point, her past is such a red flag that she'd have to talk about her relation to Spielberg in-depth, probably concerning this accusation specifically.

             I have seen a photo with a large group of men - 'featuring' John Podesta (the Molesta)'s brother Tony Podesta where they are all wearing these vibrant red shoes that stick out like a sore thumb. I know what John &amp; Tony do to children, so I was able to make the connection of the red shoes with SRA. However, I was not aware of the 'red book'. Do all of them have red books? Because if so, that would be great in terms of being able to gather physical evidence to prove their crimes.

             SKG being Spielberg Katzenberg &amp; Geffen of Dream Works.  I never saw ET was not much of a movie goer.  Would love to see that little red book.So he shows it off like some prized possession.  Red the color of blood, like their shoes.  These people are sickos.

              The prevalence of red colour is quite noticeable though, obviously a design choice, and I should still look through more scenes to see if there's a book prop on the set anywhere. There's a couple scenes of his comic page and some generic school papers, but nothing incriminating. Any idea where this red book idea came from? A CDAN? May I have the link? Do we have the right film?

              All that stuff about Vic Morrow is completely new to me though, that's seriously, criminally fucked up shit; I can't believe I've never heard it. All the circumstances around the scene; shooting time, choice of child actors, untrained pilot, that's ridiculous.

               We should still try to find proof the book exists. Even if ET isn’t the right target.
