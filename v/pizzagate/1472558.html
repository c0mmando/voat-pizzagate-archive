            I'd rather them be exposed for who they are, and no charges filed, than any harm come to anyone.

            Unless it of course, comes to those involved when they've been convicted.
           </p>

            But we know that won't happen. We know nobody will come forward as a victim. They aren't nearly as lazy as the folks at Boys Camp (Larry King), or Sandusky, for example.

            What do they care?  They are morally bankrupt.  Humanity is being led to lack empathy and normalize heinous acts.  Europe is being steamrolled and people still want to believe it's okay because

            Thank you.  I am the last person who would trust politicians.  I am also the last person who would want to see innocent lives destroyed.  Ironically, I am also the last person who would want to see these idiots destroy their own lives because they have lost their grip on rationality and are running on emotion.
           </p>
           <p>
            We've seen some weird shit, no doubt.  But surprise, some people who differ from the socially accepted 'norm' like 'weird' shit.  That weird shit may be disturbing, but it is not a crime.
           </p>
           <p>
            So, to review the above:
           </p>
           <p>
            "Alefantis and Podesta will be, and ought to be, assigned 100% of the blame."  This is just witch-hunting.  There is no legal basis for this comment.
           </p>
           <p>
            "posted photos of toddlers and infants along with sexual innuendos" This is fucked up, but is it a crime beyond reasonable doubt? No.
           </p>
           <p>
            "endorsement of pedophilia, we are not the ones who purchased imagery of tortured children and sexually abused children, we are not the ones who made videos involving sexual torture, mutilation, and pedophilia." - Zero evidence.  This is one hell of an accusation.  You can bet your ass that they are talking to their lawyers about defamation suits.
           </p>
           <p>
            "Alefantis, Hastert, Kleinman, Podesta, Epstein, and the rest -- you are cornered sewer rats."  More defamation especailly against well connected, well funded people.  Doing this without a smoking gun is the height of stupidity.  Painting a big target on yourself?  Way to fucking go.
           </p>
           <p>
            "You are personally responsible for this" - guilty until proven innocent?
           </p>
           <p>
            "so that the bigger players (Giustra, Clinton, Slim) did not risk being outed. " - Congratulations, now you have the interest of the most expensive lawyers on the planet.  Do you have any evidence AT ALL that can keep you out of jail?
           </p>
           <p>
            It's beyond retarded.  This guy is fucking begging for it.
           </p>
           <p>
            If this was directed at me, and I was innocent, and I could prove it, and I could afford the best lawyers that money can buy, guess what I'd be doing?  That's right, I'd be going for the nuclear option.  I would tear these guys a new one.  I would shit on them from such a great height it would leave a crater a mile wide.
           </p>
           <p>
            Just something to bear in mind.

            No.  The perpetrator of violence will be responsible.  Too much hearsay and not enough evidence.  Too many irrational minds and not enough healthy skepticism.  Too many innocent people will be harmed.  If you are sincere in your willingness to uncover crime and help victims, this showboating ego massaging threatening rhetoric is totally beside the point.  You are a fucking moron.
           </p>
           <p>
            This is not about you, it is about innocents and crime.  If you are going to take the moral high ground, you should do so gracefully, with skepticism in mind, with your focus where it needs to be, and get off your fucking high horse.  If you find something, notify the authorities, if they do nothing, publicise.  But you better be damned sure it is 'beyond reasonable doubt'.
           </p>
           <p>
            Wind your overblown ego in and try and do some genuine good, or shut the fuck up.

            Well put. If they are truly innocent, they would be defending themselves. Instead they are pretending that most of the US is just crazy idiots. Really? The crazy idiots who make this country full of innovation, and ideas? it sure as fuck is not any politician that has made this country so proficient. It's the hard work of common people like us that make this place awesome, and we are not stupid. In fact we are so smart, that we can take four of the perverted emails, and one twitter account, and figure out the whole psychotic operation these people have been running.
