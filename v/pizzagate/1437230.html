<p>-The wikipedia page for Madeline McCann says that Gerry McCann was born in 1968. That would place him at 29 at the time of the exchange. Considering that this was a personal ad, I\'d say its easy to believe he was lying.

<p>Then there are a fair number of posts regarding questions about maintenance for a Saab vehicle. No clear indication that this is the same user holding the <a href="https://voat.co/user/virgin">@virgin</a>.net account or that it is the same individual that is Madeline\'s father. However, considering that Madeline\'s father was a doctor, this is possible.</p>

<p>A detail that seemed benign at first struck me instantly when I read this article: </p>
<p><strong>Richard Branson offers £100,000 for Madeleine McCann legal fund</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1563250/Richard-Branson-offers-100000-for-Madeleine-McCann-legal-fund.html">http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1563250/Richard-Branson-offers-100000-for-Madeleine-McCann-legal-fund.html</a></p>
<p>-Richard Branson of course, being the owner of the company Virgin, and the domain of the email for Gerry McCann of the newsgroups.</p>
<p>This article also seemed relevent:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Occasionally their $1,200-an-hour lawyer Angus McBride, whose salary is defrayed by Virgin founder Sir Richard Branson, Scottish businessman Stephen Winyard, and Brian Kennedy, a multi-millionaire rugby-team owner, drops in on the British tabloids to protest headlines such as portuguese paper smear: “kate killed madeleine as gerry played tennis.”</p>

<p>They held fundraisers with Virgin...</p>

<p>And hey, they even took a Virgin plane flight with tickets from Branson himself shortly after Madeline\'s disappearance.</p>
<p><a href="http://madeleinemccann.org/blog/2014/04/20/gerrys-usa-trip/">http://madeleinemccann.org/blog/2014/04/20/gerrys-usa-trip/</a></p>

<hr />
<p>Now all of this could just be a kind gentleman solely interested in helping this family be reunited. However, Richard Branson owns the Carribean island just next to known pederast Jeffrey Epstein. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160303180114/http://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/jeffrey-epstein-sordid-high-life-4919588">https://web.archive.org/web/20160303180114/http://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/jeffrey-epstein-sordid-high-life-4919588</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Epstein’s global property portfolio included Manhattan’s largest private residence, a ranch in New Mexico, a mansion in Florida and private island neighbouring Richard Branson’s in the Caribbean.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And lets not forget that Branson is a member of ICMEC and apparently in close contact with none other than John Podesta.</p>

<p>There is surely more to this out there. I was entirely shocked to find anything at all on Gerry McCann. We need to keep digging on this because this may be the most clear connection to anything nefarious we have.</p>',

           Now all of this could just be a kind gentleman solely interested in helping this family be reunited. However, Richard Branson owns the Carribean island just next to known pederast Jeffrey Epstein.

           <p>
            Epstein’s global property portfolio included Manhattan’s largest private residence, a ranch in New Mexico, a mansion in Florida and private island neighbouring Richard Branson’s in the Caribbean.

          </blockquote>
          <p>
           And lets not forget that Branson is a member of ICMEC and apparently in close contact with none other than John Podesta.

           There is surely more to this out there. I was entirely shocked to find anything at all on Gerry McCann. We need to keep digging on this because this may be the most clear connection to anything nefarious we have.

            I don't know if the post you found was from THE Gerry McCann but I was reading comments on a blog dedicated to Madeleine and people were mentioning him going to chat rooms looking to hook up with women, while married.  I'll look for that blog.

            Damn good idea! I did that same search logged into to google which returns fuller results. Did you see the link at alt.dating.uk.south-east? That's the one you I think needs to be checked. Something going on in that thread. Date was 9/4/99 by gerry.mccann 
Also alt.sex.swingers.uk seems to have a link with gerry mccann also that seems related, might be critical. Look for 4/5/99 by Gerrry Mccann 
If you can't see them you have to log into google apparently. There's something there. I didn't follow the links but it doesn't look good for Gerry from the outside if that's Madeleline's father. Worth checking out. The name Gerry McCann is associated with two posts related to lolitas and teens, and others with Uk swinger hookups, nudism, etc. That Freud guy was said to have charmed Kate Healy by suggesting she was addicted to sex when he first met her. They were all swingers? Seems likely.
Also there is an exchange about SS officers involving a guy named Gerry McCann in an alt conspiracy titled Secret Service Agent Emory Roberts. The exchange is here.

             A vanity fair article on JFK killing lists a "Gerard McCann" so maybe he was known as Gerry or Jerry then and that was maybe his father?

             lists "Jerry McCann" as SS for JFK. So a few spellings are used. It's an idea.

               Sure, log into facebook, linked, in twitter etc, and search for them Gerry/Jerry/Gerald/ or whatever McCann with other parameters one at a time like Uk, Britain, major cities like London, etc. Eliminate people too young now to have participated in online discussions then and super old guys and you'll get an idea of how many people today could have made comments on a board like that then. I'm sure Madeleine's father doesn't have a page unless it's like a fund or something, but you'd get an idea if somebody else could be a match for the commentator that was trolling swinging sites back then instead. There are online directories, white pages for people, but I've never had success using them. They always want you to pay to get any real info.

            Brilliant work. I'd give anything to tie him to comment that says "anyone want to buy a little girl?" , "Getting pretty sick of dealing with this kid really want to sell it" Then we got these creeps.

             Certainly doesn't help that his company name seems rather blatant:
