</p>
<p>Barbara Comstock (R) is running for Congress in the 10th district located in Northern VA in the primary to be held on <strong>June 12th</strong>.  The 10th district is a critical battleground located squarely in Fairfax County.  The county with the highest rate of child disappearances in the United States.</p>
<p>We also know that the Soros money was earmarked to send 100\'s of CIA assets into the political battleground, ostensibly on the D side, but I\'d bet both sides is more likely.

<p>Her opponent is a man named Shak Hill: <a href="https://twitter.com/shakhill">https://twitter.com/shakhill</a></p>
<p>The problem is this website: <a href="http://shadyshak.com/">http://shadyshak.com/</a></p>
<p>Running the various allegations against Shak Hill through the BS detector, I\'m coming up with credible patterns of behavior based on the Washington Free Beacon, a reliable source.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Shak recently talks about milking the prostate and penis enlargement and vaginal pimples: <a href="http://freebeacon.com/politics/priming-pump-comstock-primary-opponent-posting-penis-enlargement-summer/">http://freebeacon.com/politics/priming-pump-comstock-primary-opponent-posting-penis-enlargement-summer/</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&quot;Among the tweets he has &quot;liked&quot; on the website is a March 25, 2015, post from <a href="https://voat.co/user/TotalOrgy">@TotalOrgy</a> that reads, &quot;Would you share you wife/gf like this? #TwitterAfterDark #NSFW #orgy.&quot;: <a href="http://freebeacon.com/politics/virginias-shak-hill-likes-hardcore-porn-twitter/">http://freebeacon.com/politics/virginias-shak-hill-likes-hardcore-porn-twitter/</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&quot;He does, however, follow other Twitter accounts that specialize in sharing pornographic material.&quot; ANother quote.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Here\'s where this website gets weird: <a href="http://shadyshak.com/">http://shadyshak.com/</a> &gt;Click &quot;Creepy Charity&quot;.  Apparently Shak, his wife, and another man named Ronald Gallagher co-founded a........you guessed it.  A charity for sexually abused children named <a href="http://search.sunbiz.org/Inquiry/CorporationSearch/ConvertTiffToPDF?storagePath=COR%5C2005%5C0712%5CH0166764.Tif&amp;documentNumber=N05000007050">&quot;Joseph\'s House&quot;</a> </p>
<p>Shak\'s business partner, Ronald Gallagher is a convicted boy pedophile (ref. embedded charges within website including citations).  Unless someone can show there are two different &quot;Ronald Gallagher&quot; with the same vitals, I\'m pretty sure they are the same person.</p>
<p>From the website:</p>
<p>&quot;The Sex Offender &amp; Former Director of Joseph House was convicted in 1984 for sexually assaulting 3 little boys under the age of 14. The Sex Offender was between the ages of 35 and 36 years old at the time of the offenses. The Sex Offender was sentenced to 30 months in a community control program, and 10 years of probation. (State Of Florida Vs [Redacted], Case #T84-2155-CFA, Filed 7/5/84)&quot;</p>
<p>So we have an R candidate (A rating from NRA, Susan B Anthony pro-life), running against another R candidate, Shak Hill, who posts creepy stuff on social media, milks prostates, and has a failed charity dealing with sexually abused boys whose business partner is a convicted boy pedo.  I think &quot;birds of a feather, flock together&quot; is a pretty demonstrable pattern at this point. (And don\'t give me some BS about Trump and one of his 500 companies - spare me).</p>
<p>One last thing (from the website): &quot;Shak Hill changed his name as an adult from Edward Wayshak Mangum to Wayshak Edward Hill - taking the last name of his wife and switching his first and middle names&quot;.</p>
<p>I\'m not as good on the autist stuff.  Let\'s see if y\'all can dig up dirt on Shak\'s past.  For those of you with social media, it\'s time to make a difference.  Spread the word.  Nail the pedo.</p>
<p>I\'d appreciate a repost of this wherever possible.  We have a chance to ensure a win for the good gal.  I\'m not shilling politically for Comstock.  I\'m ensuring a pedo gets sent packing in humiliation at the very least.  Custodes vero.</p>
<p>Relevance: The pedophiles are trying to infiltrate one of the last R districts in Northern VA.  Where Podesta and Awan live.  And about 100k more pedos.</p>',
