<p>There\'s always been something weird about his brother.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In a phone call provided to Big League Politics by a source who wishes to remain anonymous at this time, private investigator Rod Wheeler explains what happened with the Fox News coverage of Seth Rich — and how brother Aaron Rich was actively attempting to shut down anyone looking into the WikiLeaks connection.</p>
<p>On August 1, Wheeler filed a lawsuit in New York City alleging White House involvement in pushing the story. But in this recording, he explains that he acted on his own in contacting Fox News reporters — and exactly how that all went down. The White House being involved is not mentioned once.</p>
<p>Wheeler said that brother Aaron Rich tried to block Wheeler from looking at Seth’s computer, even though there could be evidence on it. “He said no, he said I have his computer, meaning him,” Wheeler said. “I said, well can I look at it?…He said, what are you looking for? I said anything that could indicate if Seth was having problems with someone. He said no, I already checked it. Don’t worry about it.”</p>
<p>Wheeler said that Seth’s girlfriend told him that Aaron Rich had possession of Seth’s cell phones, but Aaron denied it and said “we’re not going to worry about the cell phones.”</p>
<p>Aaron also blocked Wheeler from finding out about who was at a party Seth attended the night of the murder.</p>
<p>“All I want you to do is work on the botched robbery theory and that’s it,” Aaron told Wheeler, according to Wheeler’s claim on the audio. Wheeler said that Seth’s father Joel “does not appear to have any hidden agenda.”</p>

            2cents: seems like he was paid, again and more, to confuse things further. Nothing makes sense about this story or the story about the story. S'all a circus now (was always?)

            this brother is a complete assclown...The laughing during the interview, the refusal to show extremely pertinent evidence (laptops/phones) I can;t find them but i remember someone had screen shots of Aarons twitter account showing him yelling at a cousin because the cousin was talking about the case saying they'd like help to find out what happened.  The Seymour Hersh audio is HUGE if it's legit. I think he won a pulitzer...MSM can't call him a conspiracy theorists as easily they do others.

            Yeah well Rod Wheeler has outed himself as control grid--a limited hangout.  I have / wrote his transcript from the george webb/jason goodman interview and he said nothing about a 'misquote' in fact he led them to believe QUITE THE OPPOSITE.
           </p>
           <p>
            He sues / his story breaks the news at just the right time to 'step on' the awan brother press.
           </p>
           <p>
            This coupled with Roger Stone saying imran was with seth rich (it wasn't)
           </p>
           <p>
            is clearly a coordinated effort in the media to discredit George Webb's thesis.  Only it won't work.  We've already put together a dossier on the awans and nearly (it's about 80%) everyone involved with them

            This information (maybe not the map itself but what it links to) will be used in several massive court cases that are forthcoming.  Something like watergate meets iran contra meets nuremberg.  I know that sounds like a big tough statement, it's just that it's true.  What these guys did, and what's worse, how the media is complicit, how over 80 democrats are complicit in the coverup is called 'misprision of treason' and it's a felony.   It might bring down the entire democratic party and part of the republican party.  This is not a hillary thing, but rather a 7th floor thing, with members in both parties.  For example McCain and Graham are a part of it. They've been shipping illegal arms from bulgaria to syria, possibly white phosphorus and possibly moving depleted uranium around as well.  These are things that aren't just illegal, they will land them in international tribunals and we know what they did to saddam hussein

             GW does that himself, he doesn't need "a coordinated effort in the media."
            </p>
            <p>
             A major component of this thesis is based on Imran Awans's "diplomatic immunity." I am getting mixed reports and finding it difficult to confirm but his lawyers (Imran's),
             <em>
              Gowen, Rhoades and Silva
             </em>
             , stated that he has US Citizenship.
            </p>
            <p>
             Also, the US has not banned the the use of napalm or white phosphorous, which fall under the UN Convention of Conventional Weapons, specifically Protocol III. So, there won't be any "international tribunals."

            First of all I do not trust Rod Wheeler. There is just something that does not sit well.  The stories keep changing.  Why would Aron let Wheeler check out Seth's computer?  Did he have a court order? Also the phone.  I propose that LE has the cell phone.  It was with Seth and when he died they surely took it for evidence.  Also there was probably evidence of calls he made.  He had called his father (or so it has been mentioned in other articles).  Aron visited at the fire house where the EMTs were stationed that came to the attack scene that night so where is the proof that Aron was stonewalling the case? At least that is what it seems that Wheeler is implying.  I just can't buy it.

             I don't trust him either. But the brother still seems really weird. Heck I don't know what to think. It could have been a plan from the beginning to lead us in the wrong direction or make us look like conspiracy theorists. I've watched and listened to so much about the Seth Rich murder. That's if he was murdered. There are so many opinions. Several could be the case. Nothing surprises me anymore when it comes to these sicko's. Wikileaks just released the audio.

              I get the feeling they are throwing all these different scenarios out there so that we WILL be dazed and confused.  So we don't know which way is Sunday.  Think about it, the hospital, no death certificate, the appointed spokesperson, a possible forced video of the family after the fact, and now all the Wheeler drama.  You would think the police would be investigating all this?  I am inclined to think it is part of a plan.

            There is no way Rod Wheeler is for real. I've got 10000 to 1 that this subterfuge was cooked up on Barack Obama's morning "How to frame Trump" conference call with all the Deep State perps most likely to go to prison if it ever comes out they were child, organ, weapons and drug trafficking their corrupt asses off for the past 8 years.
           </p>
           <p>
            The good news is it looks like the Russian Hacking hoax is now officially dead. If I had to guess Trump &amp; Co started telegraphing Mueller was going to be asked to step down due to conflicts of interest with his fellow FBI partner in crime James Comey. That must have gotten the brain trust working this new angle.
