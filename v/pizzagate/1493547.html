            So I am confused, why was Scalia killed?  because the dirt was exposed or because of a pending case? The article says Obama gave Scalia a file implicating the whole shebang but why now is Obama covering for Hildebeast? If Obama is involved why would Scalia need to go? In a war between SCOTUS AND POTUS why would SCOTUS kill their own when they had a full court and Obama got the next nomination?

             The rumor is Obama hated Scalia bc he was behind the impeachment against Clinton.  Always wanted to get back at Scalia.  Big pedo (I believe name was Allen) was busted by FBI in Jan 2016. There was his computer with tons of pedo stuff on it.  Supposedly, Scalia was involved in pedo and there was all sorts of blackmail stuff, pics, etc., so Obama finally had goods on Scalia.  The day Scalia was leaving for Cibolo ranch Obama demanded he come to WH.  He gave Scalia manila envelope with all the goods on him.  The Citzens Untied case was coming up on SCOTUS docket that summer and Obama  knew Scalia' s vote would tip the case. He told Scalia how to vote and if he didn't he would let everyone know about pedo stuff.  Scalia then immediately flew out to Cibolo Ranch and told the guys all about what Obama planned to do.  The rumor goes on to presume his own friends smothered him to shut down the whole Scalia problem and not bring all them down as well.  Obama was so mad that these St Huberis guys "gamed" him at his own blackmail game he would not even go to Scalia's funeral. He was furious and with Scalia being now the deciding vote on Citzens United it failed and was then remanded to the lower court with previous decision staying in place.  Supposedly an FBI anon leaked all this info.

              Thank you, I wasn't seeing how his own buds whacking him helped their cause but your explanation makes sense. Pretty much goes to show how there nothing they wont do.

             Yes, the Podesta email mentioned wet works.  "Didn't think wet works meant pool parties at the Vineyard".  The Cibolo Creek Ranch has a vineyard.  Link to email...
