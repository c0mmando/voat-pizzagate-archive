            Here's a better article from 2011 with a self-made Trump video talking about the backstory of eating pizza with Palin. He does not use the word "pizza-gate" in this earlier video. My opinion is that this could very well have been intentional to plant a "seed" for the future. Trump knows the media and how to get publicity. The story is so odd, that it lends credibility to Digisphere's claim.

            Trump had his own brief scandal years ago, in 2011, dubbed 'Pizzagate', because he was 'caught' using a fork and a knife when eating pizza (at a meeting with Sarah Palin). MSM made a big fuss about it.
            <strong>
             This is the 'Pizzagate' he is referring to in this video.

             I wouldn't say this is debunked. Yes, here he is mocking the MSM going insane over he and Sarah Palin using forks to eat pizza in 2011. That doesn't mean he or his team did not deliberately "seed" the term into the converstion on /pol/ and
             <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/The_Donald">
              r/The_Donald
             </a>
             during the Podesta email Wikileaks digging. We know that the suspicious "pizza" references were found because an anon had dropped a crumb about the food codes on 4chan.
            </p>
            <p>
             We also know that Pizzathrowaway777,

              who started r/pizzagate on Reddit
             </a>
             , did not come up with the term himself, but borrowed it from Instagram:
            </p>
            <blockquote>
             <p>
              I have told this story to many people, and I am always asked: “why did you call it
              <a href="https://np.reddit.com/v/Pizzagate">
               /v/Pizzagate
              </a>
              ?”.
             </p>
             <p>
              I had seen a couple of people throw around the name Pizzagate, and I had also seen some people opposed to this name being used. When I was searching through James Alefantis’ Instagram account the night it was discovered, someone else had decided to create
              <a href="https://files.catbox.moe/ikwj3s.png">
               an Instagram account
              </a>
              called “pizzagate2016”. This person began using this account to troll James Alefantis with comments on his Instagram photos about the horrific knowledge the internet had come to learn that evening...I decided that using the name
              <a href="https://np.reddit.com/v/Pizzagate">
               /v/Pizzagate
              </a>
              was the best chance for this investigation to go viral and make a difference in government corruption around the world.
             </p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>
             We also know that the whole methodology of QAnon, who has repeatedly proven himself/themselves to be working with Trump, is to drops "crumbs" which then prove to be prescient months or even years later.
            </p>
            <p>
             We also know that in October of 2012, Trump

              tweeted
             </a>
             "Got to do something about these missing chidlren grabbed by the perverts. Too many incidents--fast trial, death penalty." In November 2012, he also

              tweeted

             "Pervert alert.

            </p>
            <p>
             Trump could very easily have had his people feed the "pizzagate" term he used during the Palin incident into the Wikileaks research frenzy. There is support for that theory; this isn't debunked, in my view.

              You know I had actually forgotten the account name of who started the Pizzagate sub was pizzathowaway777. I am sure that it is just another coincidence that the number 777 was chosen considering the significance it holds for /pol and the beginning of Q.

              As far as I understood, the term 'Pizzagate' wasn't even coined by Trump at the time; it seems to have been coined by news outlets like Salon, who made fun of Trump.

             <p>
              The post should at least be flaired 'Accuracy?'. The term 'Pizzagate' was used for the fork and knife story (=fact), what OP and what you allege is merely speculation. But this is a research sub for research based on facts.

             <p>
              'He knew!!!!!!!' in the headline is mere speculation. OP doesn't even mention the real Trump 'Pizzagate'.

               Excuse me. I didn't "allege" anything. Everything I stated

                was

               a fact, which I supported with links to the direct sources. Trump

               OP's title says Trump mentioned the word in 2011 (which is accurate) and that "he knew" -- implying that Trump knew Weiner was part of a cabal of pedophiles. You say this is "mere speculation" because it was coined by news outlets making fun of Trump. But nothing you linked shows any news outlet using that term prior to Trump. Nor could I find any. Here's how the coverage went down:

               Think-, the "Sliced and Diced: Trump's Pizza Faux Pas" video report you linked wasn't aired until June 3, two days after Trump's live interview on CNN. Same with the Salon article you cited.
              </p>
              <p>
               The New York Daily News story was published the afternoon of June 1, but it doesn't mention "Pizzagate". The Young Turks
               <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9NekC-u-b-g">
                covered their dinner as it happened on May 31
               </a>
               and described the dinner and Palin as a "fraud", but didn't use the term "Pizzagate" either.
              </p>
              <p>
               It does appear that Trump is the one who coined the term on Piers Morgan.
              </p>
              <p>
               Did you listen to what Trump actually

                says
               </em>
               in the June 1, 2011 CNN video?

               <p>
                "I watched this

              </blockquote>
              <p>
               At 1:52, Trump says "I don't think it's just a joke. And I think it's pretty bad when a Congressman gets hacked into."
              </p>
              <p>

               hacking all mentioned by Trump. Was he only talking about Weiner's claims of moment? Or did he have friends in the NSA back then who knew what Weiner, Podesta, Hillary, Huma and Alefantis had on their hard drives?

               Trump linking "Pizzagate" and "Weinergate" in the same sentence the day after meeting with Palin and mentioning
               <em>
                hacking
               </em>
               certainly makes my eyebrows go up, especially in light of his tweet the following year (2012) about missing kids and perverts needing the death penalty.
              </p>
              <p>
               Did he know in 2011 someone was eventually going to nudge 4chan to search for "pizza" in the hacked Podesta emails, and someone was going to make an Instagram account named Pizzagate2016 that trolled Alefantis' pedoey posts? That sounds preposterous...unless the whole thing was planned by the same people. QAnon has said

               The Young Turks certainly thought the 2011 pizza outing was staged. And the NYT seemed to think Trump and Palin were in cahoots.

                Yes, and that's speculation. Everybody knew about Weinergate at the time, it was all over the news.

               <p>
                That's fine, but it doesn't prove anything about Trump scheming a hack of Dem computers, and as I explained, the term 'pizzagate' was used by him referring to news outlets reporting about his table manners.
               </p>
               <p>
                OP didn't even make the effort to put the video into context, so that users would have been able to decide for themselves, and would have had a fair chance to understand what might have been the background for using the term 'pizzagate' at the time.

               Which came first?
              </p>
              <p>
               The first ever use of the word Pizzagate came from Trump on CNN (which trump trolls as fake news) before any article was released about the Palin incident.  He mentions Weinergate which has become directly tied to HRC and Pizzagate. So it’s not just one coincidence but two. This makes the mathematical improbability of those two facts being just coincidence extremely unlikely.
              </p>
              <p>
               To me this was a crumb dropped way before Trump ran for president. Future proves past. You can also go to Micheal Flynn’s twitter and see where he liked a video pointing the Trump/Pizzagate connection out.
              </p>
              <p>
               Pizzagate was a part of Q teams plan all along and has been in the works for years. I personally think that there are no coincidences when it comes to the timing of all of this and that it was done intentionally for us to piece together at a later date.

                 That’s a whole lot of coincidences 5 years before Pizzagate.  The mathematical improbability is through the roof on this one and my spidey senses are tingling. It would be a lot different if it didn’t all revolve around Trump or if this involved multiple people.  However, since he stepped into the political arena our lives have been focused on the horrors and crimes of the political elite. You just can’t deny that.
                </p>
                <p>
                 Some people will never believe or maybe don’t want to believe because of opinions they have formed on POTUS. It doesn’t matter honestly. It’s all happening and we have always been on the same team. At least we had better be. I started all of this at the beginning of Pizzagate and eventually moved on to Q. So to me it’s always been connected. This interview only reaffirms it to me.

                   What Rebekah and Cameron talked about most of all -- and I'm a trained journalist so I understand the need to get things right -- is sausage rolls.
We were planning a big walk with all our kids over Christmas and thought it might be a good idea to build a fire in my woods and stop off for a picnic. Rebekah was worried about what we'd eat. Cameron thought sausage rolls would be nice

                  clearly, in 2011 Trump was ALSO "seeding" wieners, which were also on that "food codeword" list his JewAnon "seeded" when it broke and which turned out to be totally discrediting bullshit red herrings
