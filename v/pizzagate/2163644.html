            Something does not sound right.  The Lambert child who is from an incredibly wealthy family, was raped by a man of some Prominence.  But really the Lambert family is filthy rich and of extreme importance, so why are they protecting this member of the Philharmonic Orchestra.  The Mother is the one fighting for the daughter, so possibly a sharing of the child by the father, among friends so to speak.  It is still very sad that the girl did not find final justice.  Shame on the rapist and whoever is letting him get away with it, for I am sure he is continuing his sick perverted raping of other girls.  They never stop until they are six feet under.

             No the father was very devastated and also did what he could to have Vincent Meyer convicted.  Meyer had befriended the Lamberts and become a family friend.
            </p>
            <blockquote>
             <p>
              He met the Lamberts in 1988, when he was in the midst of a divorce, and became a trusted friend, spending time with them at their home in Geneva, Switzerland.
             </p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>
             During that time he befriended young Philippine and spent a lot of time with her, in retrospect, Marion believed he had been grooming her daughter.
            </p>
            <blockquote>
             <p>
              The alleged abuse is said to have ended when Philippine was 15 after her parents cut ties with Meyer who, according to Marion, was “always asking for something”, causing them to fall out.
Philippine spiralled into a long battle with anorexia and depression. She self-harmed and attempted to take her own life three times.
             </p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>
             They tried to take him to court in 1997 after Philippine killed herself.
            </p>
            <blockquote>
             <p>
              Meyer was arrested in Switzerland in December 1997 for rape, sexual misconduct toward a minor and involuntary homicide.
He admitted having a “beautiful and affectionate relationship” with her but insisted it was never sexual.
             </p>
             <p>
              In 2000 the charges were dropped after the Swiss public prosecutor ruled a lack of evidence and that some of the allegations had reached the five-year statute of limitations.
             </p>
             <p>
              The charge of involuntary homicide was not pursued by the Lamberts.
             </p>
             <p>
              The ruling was later upheld by the Swiss court of appeal.
             </p>
             <p>
              Meyer went on to marry Elizabeth Stuart, niece of the Earl of Moray.
             </p>
             <p>
              He cemented himself in London high society by becoming president of the London Philharmonic Orchestra, of which Prince Charles is a patron.
             </p>
             <p>
              The Lambert family never came to terms with the fact he had not been tried in court.
Philippe, who died in 2011, reportedly attacked Meyer in a Geneva street in 2004.

              BINGO.  Sorry if I missed that part about Prince Charles.  So basically he befriended them to get at their daughter.  This happens to a lot of single Moms with children.  Dating women in order to have access to their kids.  It can happen with the rich of  course as well, and  then the rapist can get off Scott Free with friends in High Places.  We know Charles protects his Fellow Pedos, such as Jimmy Savile.

               Given a case with money and influence on both sides, it's the Pedos in European Society who get priority treatment.  It would be interesting to know for sure if Vincent Meyer was connected to the VIP pedo rings in the UK, Belgium, etc. (Was his name on any of the VIP CP subscribers lists that were ignored or destroyed? like CRIES)

              I dont understand the message at all, which makes that a typically embarrassing attempt at humor.  Is that the white house but in Israel? Whats funny about camels?  Is it funny that the Siberians have yaks? Is your husband also low-IQ? How else could he stand you?

              But not surprised you spent the time rather than say, find new leads -- you have shown over 3/4 OF A YEAR that you're simply not capable, which is just sad, really.

               It’s the dome of the rock Mr Jew expert. The camel is because your people in the Middle East ride camels. You know, the pedophiles that marry kids? The goat bride is because you like to fuck goats.

               Oh am I not supposed to do anything else in life but explore new leads? I was kicking back at the park making this for fun. What leads do you find? I’ve heard your theory for 3/4 of a year. It’s all because of the Jews. What else ya got?

                Wrong, it wasn't my "theory" until a few months in when their numbers made it BEYOND OBVIOUS.  You are the absolute worst poster here, and I promise you will be the poster child for rescinding your right to vote.

                    I love bacon.  Equine once claimed jews originally forbade it because some were trying to sell the burnt moloch offerings as pork.  LOL! Why dont you go confirm or debunk that, do something useful for once.

                     Well that was the only thing that made me doubt you could be Equine because I truly believe horsefucker is really a Jew. I know too much about his personal life for it to all be a lie. So if you aren’t Muslim, then you ARE horsefucker or he’s your online lover. I thought maybe you were a terrorist with a fetish for ugly faggot Jews.

                    <p>
                     Oh and you keep bringing up my husband. He’s awesome and successful. He doesn’t get paid to shill online. He’s been with me since he was 15 and I was 14 and he isn’t sick of me yet. I’m a sweet person except to bullies. I have watched you pick on everyone, especially women for a long time. So I don’t feel bad being mean to you. I even have to tone it down here because you make me sick.

                       You didn’t drive Darkmath out. You wish. What do you mean what has he done for white people lately? He married me and he made me coffee this morning so I guess you can add that to your list. Why do you think that I wouldn’t care about living in a U.S. that resembles Brazil? Since when do I not care?

            People need to understand that for these pharisaic fake "Jews", child rape is a very common occurrence. Their very "holy book", the Talmud, endorses it in various passages. Among other filth, that is. This has been going on for two thousand years or more.

            Baron Lambert was the great-grandson of Baron James de Rothschild and the great-great-grandson of Samuel Lambert, who established the family-owned Banque Lambert in 1840. It merged with Banque de Bruxelles in 1974, forming Banque Bruxelles Lambert, one of Belgium's largest banks.

            Vincent Meyer, was born into the prestigious Lazard Frères dynasty and inherited a fortune that afforded him a lifestyle of the super-rich.
           </p>
           <p>
            2001
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             VINCENT MEYER, the president and lavish benefactor of the London-based Philharmonia Orchestra, will not stand trial in Switzerland for allegedly sexually abusing an adolescent girl who later committed suicide, prosecutors say.
            </p>
            <p>
             The millionaire philanthropist was arrested by Swiss police three years ago and charged with manslaughter and rape following the death of Philippine Lambert, who killed herself at the age of 20. It was alleged that Mr Meyer began abusing Philippine, daughter of the international banker Baron (Philippe) Lambert and his wife Marion, who were family friends, when she was 12 and continued until she was 15.
            </p>
            <p>
             Marc Bonnant, the Lamberts' lawyer, said: "The public prosecutor said the charges against Meyer were not inconsiderable. But he said there was insufficient evidence that Philippine was physically forced into a sexual relationship."
            </p>
           </blockquote>
           <p>
            Apparently her suicide note in describing his predatory behavior wasn't enough to convince them that she was an unwilling victim of a pedophile.  Philippine Lambert killed herself a few weeks after her 20th birthday in 1997, after claiming a family friend (Vincent Meyer) raped and sexually abused her as a child.
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             Phillippine wrote: “I want Vincent Meyer to pay for having sexually abused me from the age of 12 to 14 and go to jail for the rest of his life.”
            </p>
            <p>
             The last words of her daughter stayed with Marion Lambert for almost two decades and she made it her mission to fulfill her daughter's final wish.
            </p>
