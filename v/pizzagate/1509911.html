<p>Related to PIZZAGATE? Fuck yes because the subject is owned by the folks mentioned. The agenda is Clear, stay focused on Jame Alefantis and create a Giant fucking law-suit that &quot;Pro-Gay&quot; Peter Thiel will rescue poor Alefantis from the fuck-wit witchhunters. All approved by Heir dTrumpf.</p>
<hr />
<p>It\'s rather apparent now the game. Since Thiel destroyed Gawker his goal was to eliminate all news alternative to FaceBook which he is board and major OWNER.</p>
<p>Trump of course came to power by lawyers ( Roy Cohn ), Peter Thiel was a lawyer in NYC long before he became a whore in Silicon(e) Valley.</p>
<p>Note also that Y-Combinator is 100% GAY, they require kids to stay over, you can\'t join unless you stay in hotel near Them ( the pedophiles ), so essentially they\'re playing a game where if your not willing to be ass-fucked you can\'t be a billionaire, ... OK its their game. They have gone INTL.</p>
<p>Now in say UKRAINE high-tech ppl make 10X of locals, its cool to be rich, but not cool to suck dick and fuck men in the ASS.</p>
<p>Peter Thiel and Don Trump say &quot;Fucking People in the Ass is NOT GAY&quot;, Thiel never wants to be seen as &quot;GAY&quot;</p>
<p>This is NOT new, this is Dick Cheney, this is GW BUSH, this is Adolf Hitler, this is Henry Ford. Power comes from fucking men in the ass, its a power that makes them mad, and correct its NOT GAY.</p>
<hr />
<p>Thiel is Bilderberg, he didn\'t come out for Trump until he attended the summer meeting and they told him what to do.</p>
<p>Trump &amp; Thiel both want to shutdown the Internet to free speech.</p>
<p>Thiel hates monopolies ( watch his stanford videos ), Thiels plan is to MONOPOLIZE all information on earth.</p>',
