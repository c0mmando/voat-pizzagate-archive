            It should be noted that Beck became very involved in the cause of human trafficking in 2013. In fact, it was in May of 2013 that his "For the Record" show on The Blaze investigated human trafficking in America – maybe that is how he came upon this whistleblower?

            He also got heavily involved with Operation Underground Railroad around that same time.

            And we know of the recent busts in Haiti and Thailand that he was involved with, which were done along with that organization. An interesting "coincidence."

            As a former Beck watcher/listener, I distinctly remember this and then the disappointment when he decided to not pursue it.  When the 2016 elections rolled around I couldn't understand why Beck was so adamant to support Ted C.who's reputation is not virgin white.  It actually makes sense now.

            If people in the past (including Assange and possibly Beck or even Snowden) could have figured out how to do that without tipping their hands, things would be better.

            Geez Jem. Lighten up. Beck's character is hardly being assassinated. He had info, held it back and then had a very public meltdown. The video is a reminder of what he had.

            Aren't there any GOOD powerful people out there? this b.s. is toooooooooo much. This world deserves the shit these elites give us because everyone who CAN do SOMETHING chooses to do NOTHING and even aids and abets the enemy for Christ's sake.Why  so damn weak and terrified? We were given power to bind Satan after all. Sorry but this is just sooooooooo upsetting!!!!!!!!!!

            If he is talking about the same thing, then backed out, it means they have blackmail info on Beck too. Not neccesarily pedo stuff of course, but something he would get in trouble for. Explains why he backed out and had to shill for Hillary. "Im with her".

             Sure Glenn Beck could be dirty but "your children will be killed" coming from a CIA, organized crime, or high government source is pretty motivating. 
Beck has definitely seemed rather castrated for a few years compared to his former zeal. Poor guy...

             Didn't the video mention that a week later Beck stated some things simply aren't worth the lives of your wife, children and family? Also said something about an in-person credible threat.

            I was never a Glenn Beck fan or watcher. However, at one point he had lost his voice and did a pretty emotional monologue using cue cards to speak what, in that moment, seemed a very poignant message. The video got extensive coverage and came up on my radar. Because of that video I decided to give him some subsequent attention. It was right on the heels of this when he claimed to have bombshell news that was going to bring down the establishment or some such claim. This, of course, was music to my ears.
           </p>

            As I recall...he may have postponed the release once (not certain)...then he said he would release the following Monday (may have been Friday..I dunno. There was another moment recorded after this video with Beck walking down the street and saying he would release on...whichever day it was.). Monday came and went. Not word one was said. I paid attention for a couple more days before losing interest. Though I knew all this satanic and/or pedophile stuff was prolific back then it wasn't strongly enough on the national radar for me to even really consider that his alleged information might be of this nature. In retrospect...I'd say the likelihood is quite high that it was along these lines (if indeed it was anything more than a stunt). Beck was always pretty dodgy in my view but he went full nut job after that.

            I used to loathe Glenn Beck, but I have to admit that this appears to be what we're investigating, at least in that it has parallel implications.
