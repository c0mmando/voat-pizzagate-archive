<h1><strong>The Delta Project and child sex rings:</strong></h1>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the late 1960’s and early 1970s John D. Norman was actively attempting to create networks of child sex trafficking rings around the US. He first set up a ring in Dallas known as the “The Odyssey Foundation” and then another in San Diego known as “The Conquest Agency”. According to Chicago police Norman also ran organizations called “The Norman Foundation”, and “Epic International”. Norman was also likely connected to the “Guyon Society” a pedophile organization founded in Europe whose members believed in establishing regular sexual contact with children prior to eight years of age.  
</p>
<p>Norman was first arrested in Texas, and police seized a card-file index of 30,000 contacts including victims and clients of the sex ring. It was implied that many of the contacts were politicians, clergy, and millionaires. Dallas PD sent the card index to the State Department for investigation but The State Department rejected the evidence claiming &quot;the cards were not relevant to any fraud case concerning a passport&quot;. The State Department destroyed the entire 30,000 card index. The State Departments lawyer Matthew Nimitz could not explain why the cards were only looked at as a passport issue, nor why they were not forwarded to FBI or postal inspectors.  
</p>
<p>After charges were levied against Norman in Texas, he fled to Chicago where he formed “The Delta Project”. His vision for this organization was expanding upon a network of child sex slaves across the US who could be called to service men when needed. His plan involved establishing “dormitories” designed to house three to four children and monitored by one or more adults. It’s unclear how far Norman got in his plans before being arrested by Chicago police in 1973 however Chicago PD said Norman’s ring was active in Chicago, Dallas, and Los Angeles. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>According to a congressional hearing;</strong><br />
<em>Senator Culver; Would you describe this project, how it works?</em>  
</p>
<p><em>Mr.Lehman; He sends out material and receives material from other agencies similar to his, which invites men to – well, one program is called the Don program. In this program, he invites anyone who is willing to have a cadet, which is a young boy between the age of 13 and 19 right in there, to have him live in his house, he will take – a don should take one to three cadets to live with him in his house. He would pay a fee of $50 a month for having these cadets live in his house. But at the same time, these cadets would not only serve him sexually, but would also – any other members of the Delta Project, which is quite vast, would contact these dons and he could invite them for a weekend and these people would in turn pay him for letting them use his facilities, his house and the youth. And John Norman would get a percentage of this back.</em>    
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Upon his arrest by Chicago police, authorities discovered a new list of 5000 clients, contacts and subscribers to Norman’s self-published pedophile magazine entitled “Hermes”. It was one of three boy-love newsletter published in the US at the time. The other two were “Better Life Monthly” (California) and “Broad Street Journal” (Colorado).  
</p>
<p>Norman somehow continued to publish the magazine while in jail, and he also enlisted the help of Philip Paske, an inmate he met while in prison. Paske was released prior to Norman and Paske took up publication of Hermes. The Chicago Tribune eventually discovered that Paske was employed by the City of Chicago as a local swimming pool attendant. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<hr />
<h2>Notes of interest:</h2>
<ul>
<li>Dallas police suspected that Norman was trafficking victims to serial killer Dean Corll.</li>
<li>Delta Project may also have trafficked children to serial killer John Wayne Gacy. 3 checks were paid to Paske from Gacy’s construction company for unknown services.</li>
<li>Gacy claims some of the victims found in his home were not killed by him. “He insisted that other people had murdered victims in his house while he was out of town.”</li>
<li>Norman was re-convicted of molestation 1988 and of child porn distribution in 1995 and 1998. He was released from prison in 2008 in San Diego. Not known if he is still alive.</li>
<li>Paske was suspected of murdering 3 teenage boys one of whom was to testify against Norman in court. </li>
<li>Delta Project is suspected to have provided children to men traveling off-shore, possibly taking children on trips to Europe.</li>
<li>May 16 (pg.8), 1977 Chicago Tribune article contains an early reference to &quot;Chickens&quot;, or young male prostitutes.  
</li>
<li>Gacy, HR.Clinton, J.Podesta and T.Podesta all lived within a 2 mile radius of each other. T.Podesta is 1 year younger than JW.Gacy, and they very likely attended a high school together. </li>
<li>Gacy was active in the Democrat party, and also provided construction work for the DNC.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<hr />
<h2>My Theories;</h2>
<ul>
<li>A Delta Δ is a Greek letter shaped like a triangle. This may be the proto-beginnings of the now famous pedo-symbol in the declassified FBI document.</li>
<li>Gacy, Corll, Norman, and Paske were instrumental in forming the early stages of what we are calling Pizzagate. The sale and murder of children, and movement of housing were all in formative stages created by Norman and later ironed out and cleaned up by later adopters of the program.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;
&nbsp;</p>
<hr />
<h1><strong>A Call for Help</strong></h1>
<p>There is some <strong>MASSIVE</strong> evidence available to us as a community. <em>We absolutely need to get everyone on board with this.</em>  
</p>
<p><strong>1.</strong><br />
- Chicago Police should have in evidence a list of 5000 clients of J.Norman’s Delta Project and Hermes newsletter. This information is 40 years old and we should be able to get this through a FOIA request.   
</p>
<p>-The Chicago Tribune also allegedly had a copy of this list which they appear to have gotten through a leak. 
We need this list. It’s imperative. If the name Rodham, Clinton, Podesta, or Alefantis appear on this list is will be the historical killing blow we need to finalize Pizzagate research.  
</p>
<p><strong>Problem;</strong> The FOIA request is public and published on the CPD web site. I am not giving up what anonymity I have here and risking a suicide in order to submit this request. Will anyone with bigger balls than me step up to the plate and move forward with this?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>2.</strong>  
</p>
<p>Ms.Michael Sneed was one of the original reporters on the Chicaco Tribune stories about Norman and national child sex trafficking. She now works for the Chicago Sun Times and may be an ally of ours. She may still have access to the 5000 name list, or perhaps better insight to the scale of child trafficking in the 1970s all the way up to today. We need someone with street cred to contact Ms.Sneed and see if we can get a dialogue moving forward with her.  
</p>
<p><strong>Problem;</strong> She is MSM and may immediately blow off Pizzagate. We need to tread carefully with her and not flood her with emails and tweets. How do we organize an effective contact with Sneed?</p>

            ^John Wayne Gacy had strong ties to a massive trafficking ring, involving government officials; david norman the pedo sex trafficker -evidence of this was quickly covererd up, dismissed and "lost". I find it hard to believe that an index of thousands of names would just disappear. Gacy told police from the beginning, that there were many others involved ;and that the only thing they even had on him, was the fact that he owned the house where some of the bodies were being stored!

           </p>
           <p>
            ^Eyewitness' testimony says Gacy had at least one accomplice, in at least one case, but possibly 3, or more.Gacy himself said he was not acting alone. There is much evidence to support this theory.

            ^ Gacy was a secret service agent during Carter's presidency. 
He was a Democratic Party leader in chicago &amp;a member of the jaycees. He was arrested for sexual assault and murder,well before he got caught with the bodies in the crawl space.Each time he got special treatment in jail, and got out of jail relitively quickly.He had protection on the inside. Government did not want anyone knowing their secret service, democrat leader, well respected member of the jaycees, was a child trafficker and murderer-Because many government officials were in on it with him.

            ^ one supposed Gacy 'victim' was later found alive, and well- the victim's family were told by police that their runaway son was a gacy victim- he actually was a runaway, and was never kidnapped by gacy -this shows shoddy police work on the case&amp; misidintification of victims &amp;a rush to pin it all on the serial killer secret service pedo clown democrat jaycee,JWG

            ^ a 1977 archive from the chicago tribune, about the giant sex trafficking ring that Gacy was involved in , this was an ongoing story involving trading child pornography thru the mail, politicians, and lower level players, drugs, police, prostitution etc.
Gacy bragged about having police protection &amp;remember he dressed as a police officer to lure victims -how did he get the uniform?! Again, no one in chicago, or D.C. wanted the elites connections being exposed. The chicago political machine was in dire straights at the time, so they were more than happy to let Gacy alone take the fall.

            ^ ANOTHER mistakenly identified victim - the victim's mother was told her son was found, And was a gacy victim; she never believed the official story, and had dna testing done-the body was NOT her son!! 
more Hurried police work?! How can we be sure of anything they said in mainstream "official" reports about Gacy, when a mountain of evidence was lost, and ignored?! It shows at the very least- that no one was focusing on the whole picture?!!...a sex/human trafficking ring is more plausible; considering ALL the evidence that paints an even more disturbing picture, than just one serial killer.

Many were never entered into the FBI data base (not just Gacy Victims, but missing people&amp;unidentified remains as well) talks about how this type of behaviour effects the rate at which missing people are found&amp;how cases go unsolved because of it

            Chicago has highest homicide rate, victims all very young. Perhaps their organs are being sold by DynCorp or other sick CIA crap like Serco. I got the Idea from George Webb.  ??

            Holy shit!!! This is insane info - wow! How does one submit a FOIA request? Is there a link? I'm assuming you have to give them your name and address and such? I've submitted one to the UK before, and only had to give my email address. They responded, but with a really long explanation about why they couldn't release any info to me (it was about the Madeleine McCann case). Ugh.

             What makes me hesitate on this is that the info is published online and I'm not sure who would want to potentially sacrifice their online anonymity for this.

              Ok, it looks like you can just email them a request? In which case, the only info they can publish is your "name" (ahem) and email address? How bad is that if someone uses something like protonmail? Do you think they'll actually attempt to track them down and/or harass them via email?

            I wonder if we could get an organization like Judicial Watch to help with a FOIA. They do FOIAs all the time.

            I'm sorry, I don't have a link because I don't remember where I saw/read this (numerous places) but I have a tidbit about Gacy. He used to write back and forth with people, who were supposedly his fans. More than one of them said that if you provide pictures or information about your kids to him, he would write you more often and send you valuable things, such as paintings. Ramirez also wrote to large numbers of "fans." Manson still does. God knows who else. Could be another angle of how creepy people are involved in this kind of stuff.

            Nice work, we got so lucky with Pizzagate because it is the whole bonanza that covers (1) pervert pedophiles (2) satanic ritual pedorapists (3) child trafficking for $$$ and (4) child sex blackmail.  Is this just pedo-pervert-rapist slave ownership brotherhood or were they also blackmailing and gaining a political foothold?  Again, excellent stuff.

             No idea about the blackmailing. Dallas PD had a gold mine of contacts but the State Dept. destroyed everything. I can only imagine there was
             <strong>
              a lot
             </strong>
             of high profile people in that 30,000 list.
