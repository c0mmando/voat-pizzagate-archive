<p>Special Report: Murder in the Diocese of Buffalo?</p>
<p>NFSW for those that may experience upsetting results because of the description of the act of abuse upon a child</p>
<p>Church Militant has been working on an in-depth investigation for the past few weeks on some nefarious goings on in the diocese of Buffalo, New York, including perhaps what appears to be a homicide aimed at covering up information about to be released by a whistleblower priest regarding the well-established clerical homosexual network in the diocese.</p>
<p>Before we begin, there are some disturbing crime scene photos in this report so some of you may wish to turn away at that point.</p>
<p>Now, some background. </p>
<p>The diocese has a sordid history going back to at least the mid-1990s under the reign of Bp. Henry Mansell and even further — to a homosexual assault by a priest on 6-year-old Anthony Ravarini whom Church Militant interviewed last month.</p>
<pre><code>Anthony Ravarini: While me and Tommy were running around just being kids, and then this gentleman came out from the building, which is known as Fr. Dennis Riter, and he walked up to me and Tommy and asked us if we wanted ice cream — chocolate, I\'ll never forget it. Tommy said, &quot;No&quot; so he went back in the car and me, I said, &quot;Yes.&quot; So we approached the building, we went inside and he took me in his office and he nonchalantly came around and he was standing right in front of me and he dropped his trousers and he made me perform oral sex on him until he **** in my mouth and all over my face — it was in my hair. It was really disgusting. 
</code></pre>

<p>The priest who is accused of committing the foul deed — Fr. Dennis Riter — is still in circulation in the diocese, currently serving as pastor of St. Elizabeth Ann Seton in Dunkirk after having been reinstated just this past July following two new additional charges of sexual assault — these against two altar boys.</p>
<p>For a second and third time, the diocese claims there was no credible evidence to substantiate any of the accusations — just like they dismissed the accusation of 6-year-old Anthony, where Riter made the fantastic assertion that the genetic matter on Anthony\'s face, hair and shirt was his own — at 6 years old — suggesting that Anthony had wandered into a rectory bathroom and had done this to himself.</p>
<p>That homosexual assault happened in 1992, and the diocese went to great lengths to deny it happened despite the presence of two witnesses who saw the immediate aftermath just moments later.</p>
<p>One of those witnesses was a Polish seminarian stationed at the parish who Church Militant also interviewed last month, Wes Walawender. </p>
<p>Wes eventually went to a local priest, Fr. Joseph Moreno, who was Wes\' spiritual director and, together, the two composed a letter to the bishop, Edward Head, and Auxiliary B. Edward Grosz detailing the disgusting facts of what he had seen — along with Anthony’s father.</p>
<p>The letter, which was hand-delivered to the two bishops, was written on Fr. Moreno\'s computer — again that was in 1992.</p>
<p>Wes never heard anything from either bishop about the letter he had submitted and was eventually railroaded out of the Buffalo seminary. Father Joe, as a result, became increasingly cognizant of a clerical homosexual network in the diocese and began keeping informal records at first which also detailed financial corruption — but nearly all of it connecting back to the homosexual clique.</p>
<p>All of this has been confirmed by Church Militant with both family members as well as confidantes of Fr. Joe\'s.</p>
<p>In 1995, Bp. Henry Mansell was made ordinary of Buffalo and during his eight years as ordinary, a gay seminarian pipeline from mostly Colombia was established following the pattern of Cdl. Joseph Bernardin in Chicago and then-Abp. Theodore McCarrick in Newark, New Jersey.</p>
<p>Church Militant interviewed some of the Colombian seminarians — not all who were homosexual — and they confirmed for us that it was indeed a major recruiting effort by Msgr. Joseph Gatto, vice-rector of Buffalo\'s Christ the King Seminary under Henry Mansell.</p>
<p>All of this was becoming well known among local clergy — including Fr. Joe Moreno — who confidantes tell Church Militant now stepped up his efforts to document these issues and keep records.</p>
<p>Things reached a head in 2012 when, after years of documenting and detailing the homosexual clerical network in his diocese, Fr. Moreno was found dead in the rectory of his parish, St. Lawrence in Buffalo, on a Saturday afternoon — Oct. 13, 2012.</p>
<p>Immediately, questions arose when his death was almost immediately ruled a suicide. </p>
<p>Close associates, as well as family, simply do not believe it was a suicide, especially given a series of facts that would seem to rule that out.</p>
<p>For example, first, Church Militant has learned that Fr. Moreno was ready to blow the whistle and go public, both to the local media and Church officials, on everything he had learned over the years. He told his sister, Susan, that very thing on the Tuesday before he was discovered dead.</p>
<p>He repeated that to a close associate on Friday before he was found dead on Saturday. Church Militant has confirmed that Fr. Moreno faxed a multi-page document to the local newspaper, The Buffalo News, on Friday night.</p>
<p>The document itself has not turned up, but the record of the electronic transmission has. </p>
<p>Additionally, Father had made an appointment to travel to Washington, D.C. the following Wednesday, and according to associates, to the papal nunciature and meet with officials there and hand over a copy of his dossier exposing the homosexual network in Buffalo.</p>
<p>He had also spoken with his sister, who routinely made dinner for him, that dinner on Sunday night would have to be wrapped up at a specific time because he had a very important meeting.</p>
<p>Church Militant has spoken directly with the person he was scheduled to meet, and that person has confirmed that Fr. Moreno had told them he was going to hand over a very important file to them — again scheduled for Sunday — a meeting he obviously never made. </p>
<p>As events progressed, Fr. Moreno made what may prove to have been a fatal mistake, he got into a heated argument with senior chancery personnel and threatened — out loud — to expose everything he was meeting with them about.</p>

             Mocking Bird strikes again.  It's also sad that Whistle Blowers forget that they should never announce they are going to spill the beans.  But still, where is the document and who has it?  Possibly in the shredder?  Or  in the Archives of the Curia. Thank You.

             Do you know how we can keep reading these horrible accounts over and over? Idk, but maybe because we know if we don't, who else will.  I know it's for Our Children but it sure gets hard to take this stuff.  The horrid idea.....really.....he did it himself.  Anyone with a sound mind would know that is a made up lie.

              It’s been festering for so many decades and now they will keep pouring out as the children grow up and seek out justice for themselves. It’s a life long struggle for survivors and at some point they get an inextinguishable need to expose what happened to them . Now this whole generation is slowly coming forward . IMO

               I find it amazing how they cope.  How those that never come forward cope.  Do they just push it down down down and never go there, and those that do go there.  Its all so hard to even know how they can go through life.  Those that get help right away fare the best I have heard but each person is different.  Either way it is beyond our comprehension for only they can know.

                My mother  expressed her pain in anger towards me and my sisters  when we were growing up. I was not sexually abused like her but beaten and verbally abused by her. The pattern of abuse can be changed. I do not beat my children but I have expressed my hurt in verbal vileness at times. Times that can never be taken back. My children hopefully will not ever speak in vile ways to their children. Only then can the pattern of abuse  come to an end in my family. I can tell you this my mum never got over it and I live with the fact my grandfather was a paedophile :(

                 You are to be commended for working so hard to change something that was so systemic in your familiy's background.  That is what my friend Stcharles did in hers.  She refused to stay quiet and spoke out and brought accusations and was not ashamed to speak of her family's cult actions for many years before.  What courage.  You have that same courage.  You should speak to your children about it.  Let them know how difficult it was to overcome and that you are sorry.  They should know hard it was for you to overcome the chain of violence from your past and that you love them so much that you did not want it passed on.  You are not responsible for what your grandfather did.  You have done everything to make up for it.  Your mother must have had so much pain and guilt for being his daughter.  Who knows what horror she had to endure.  Not making any excuses for her, but in her way she may have been fighting the past as well. But you have done everything to finally end the pain and suffering.  Thank You for breaking that cycle.   :)

                  Thank you carmencita your words have truly helped me. I am so very grateful I cannot put it into the right  words how your reply has made me feel.
Your friend has shown real courage ♡
You show courage in what you do to  research and uncover all this sickness. I had no idea how prevalent this is around our world and I am horrified. You and others are doing the right thing to expose all this however uncomfortable it makes people. You all have the biggest hearts helping children like Stcharles and my mum ♡

                   I can't tell you how special you made me feel with those words.  Your courage though, is stronger than mine.  I can't even imagine how you and others cope.  As I said about my friend Judith, You all are My Inspiration.  Be sure though that many are waking up about what is going on in the world.  Many know but just don't know what to do about it.  That will be our next task.  God Bless You. +

                     I love you!  Thanks so much for your kind words.  God loves you too.  You are in the process of healing, and that is good.  It took me a long time to realize that it is not a process we should shorten in any way as painful as it is.  We must endure it all in order to find our way.  At my age I am still learning.  After you go through your process you too will realize how much you have learned.  God Bless You.  +

                      What we LOVE is not what these people are NOW it is to REMEMBER that they originally are from GOD and we are to LOVE that bit . Love the spark that is within ALL as that  IS GOD. We've been here back and forth soooo long it is difficult to remember WE ALL CAME FROM GOD. The behaviour of some people IS NOT LOVEABLE so the "Love your enemies" seems ridiculous as of course we DO NOT even like that behaviour.  We despise it...however unfortunately we are keeping the lower feelings going and quite LITERALLY are feeding that lower darker feelings. Let us LOVE the part IN ALL that is GOD and we lift the feelings UP . We really really do need to get a move on ♡

                       I will never find love for them.  For even though they are of God, so was the satan at one point but God cast him out.  We even have St. Michael the Archangel Prayer to keep him at bay.  So I must say that I cannot defend someone that has abused a lamb of God.  A precious innocent Child.  God too will cast them out.  Jesus forgave the thief on the Cross for he stole goods, but to forgive someone that has stolen the Soul of a Child, No Never. We must not fall for this.

                        I sent that reply to you by mistake! It was meant to go to someone else about something else! However , that is a what Jesus meant as far as I can see when he told us to love our enemies . I am interested in what you think he meant by that though. I really don't think I understand Christianity ?  I was raised RC and was so relieved to learn recently that that church was infiltrated on purpose. Such a confusion for me going to church and that makes soo much sense:) I LOVE God. ♡

                         MM. Hmm.  Which enemies?   There are many.  As I said some we just had a little spat with and maybe one that raped us or someone in our family.  There is a world of difference.  It is not that simple.  The world is complicated and so is forgiving.  This is what they have put upon us, telling us we must forgive the sinner, NO, not for egregious crimes of defiling.  Never.  That is my answer and I am done.

            It is out now or has been , the pedophilia.  The church wants this kept quiet for sure.  Perhaps this will lead to other info 
And the Vatican will crumble.  That’s their fear.

            Bribing, denying, not killing.  So sick.  So sick 
To keep a journal of knowledge and facts knowing another boy will be raped...... don’t know how he did it.    Sad

             I believe they are scared too.  We must all keep reporting their criminal acts and their hiding of them.  The description of the abuse is horrid.  I hope they are marched through the streets.

            Well.  This case seems consistent with many other cases I have heard of.  I also know personally what happens when you report these situations.  I’m glad someone is keeping track. It’s not just priests though.  And why is nothing ever done?  There is a reason.  We all know it I suspect.

             Unfortunately, many times nothing is done.  You are correct.  But things have been coming out like crazy lately.  Really, I think Church Militant is keeping track.  They have been right on their case.  I know they will demand answers and keep pushing.  There are many comments and others are now aware and will be keeping tabs as well.
