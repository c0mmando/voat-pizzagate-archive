<p>Hat tip to user <a href="https://voat.co/user/party1981">@party1981</a> for sparking this commentary.  Their work is critical for understanding the depths of evil aligned against us (truth researchers).  I have mostly taken a break from deep PG investigation at this point,  but I think that this followup to <a href="https://voat.co/user/party1981">@party1981</a> \'s most excellent post  <a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1671832">https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1671832</a> regarding the depths of evil about the CIA is highly relevant.  In order to defeat the enemy, we must fully understand their methods and tactics (Sun Tzu ...or some shit)</p>
<p>How does it directly relate to Pizzagate?  It\'s an unusually candid 2009 look at how the CIA uses SEX BRIBERY and their methodology. YouTube personality George Webb has produced numerous videos discussing these CIA &quot;Brownstone&quot; operations.</p>
<p>From the Seattle Times:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Dilemma of policing secretive CIA</p>
<p>Originally published March 22, 2009 at 12:00 am</p>
<p>Latest allegations against agent raise questions about the spy agency\'s ability to root out corrupt behavior.
WASHINGTON — As a novice CIA case officer in the Middle East, Andrew Warren quickly learned the value of sex in recruiting spies.
Colleagues said he made a habit of taking informants to strip clubs, and he began arranging out-of-town visits to brothels for his best recruits.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The piece continues...</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Two Algerian women have accused the Virginia native of drugging and sexually assaulting them, and, in one instance, videotaping the encounter.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Now this is KEY here. Notice they are admitting that there was videotape occurring.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“You have an organization of professional liars,” said Tyler Drumheller, who oversaw hundreds of officers as chief of the agency’s European division.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is an unusually candid assessment, and right on the money...LIARS is correct!  Here\'s where the coverups come into play</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The women told State Department investigators that Warren assaulted them after giving them drug-laced drinks that made them pass out. State referred the matter to the Justice Department, where an investigation began. Warren has not been charged.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Hmm...drugged women and took advantage? WTF is DOJ waiting for?  The Fix is in!
WTF are these CIA creeps doing by videoing their sex romps?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>While looking into the accusations, U.S. officials discovered in Warren’s apartment more than 24 video recordings he apparently made of his sexual encounters</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Sex-related recruiting causes concern among colleagues</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Some who worked with him said they were particularly concerned about the frequency of Warren’s use of strip clubs and other sex-related establishments for recruiting.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is crucial to understanding the PG / sexual bribery relationships</p>
<blockquote>
<p>As CIA case officers attempt to recruit a foreign spy, they often offer personal inducements. In some cases, a potential recruit may be taken to a strip club or a prostitute if it is deemed critical to cementing the relationship, longtime officers said.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Top level dog admits that oversight isn\'t nearly enough</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A. John Radsan, a former CIA assistant general counsel, said there are guidelines and structures that are intended to guard against scandal. In reality, he said, it is a self-regulating system with few incentives for reporting bad behavior.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And although these 2009 articles do not directly charge the CIA with underaged prostitutes specifically, I think we in the research community can draw parallels and infer as much</p>',

            Nice write-up...
           </p>
           <p>
            If anyone hasn't spent some time listening to George Webb's YouTube series, it is a must. He is an absolutely brilliant researcher and very clearly has the inside scoop on information from some well-placed sources.
           </p>
           <p>
            He doesn't focus on pizzagate, per se...but does spend a lot of time on the human trafficking, brownstone operations, and such (which are the very essence of pizzagate, even if not tied directly to JA or JP).

             Blows my mind when he said he started making the videos only a few months ago. The man is a legend.

             He looks at the practical, nuts and bolts of what the cabal/associates are up to. His analysis is cunning and should be utilized more by us to pressure the FBI into FOIA requests for the 650,000 emails. He offers solutions, which are common sense. He doesn't go into the occult, so his theories won't be dismissed by those who don't believe the occult has any influence in this. I for one study the occult aspect very much, but it's hard to convince people that magic is real and it's dark. They think you're insane. George Webb has literally solved the puzzle, all we need is to bring the hammer down...

            Andrew Warren, a 42 year old former CIA Chief of Station in Algeria, was arrested April 2010. Warren’s neighbors called Norfolk police when Warren exposed himself in public. “He had his genitals hanging out of his pants, over the top of ‘em,” said one witness. Warren reportedly said “Excuse me. I’ve had minor surgery so I get a little horny sometimes.” He had been terminated from employment with the CIA in May 2009, after he drugged the drink of a woman in Algiers and raped her. Warren plead guilty and, June 2009, was indicted on sexual assault charges. Diplomatic Security Service agents also found child pornography on Warren’s laptop computer in 2008. When he was the CIA’s Chief of Station in Algeria, he allegedly “drugged and raped multiple women before getting recalled home.” Warren was sentenced, on sex assault charges, among others, to more than five years in federal prison in March 2011. It appears Warren was not charged for the child pornography on his government computer.

            I believe this is so much more common than we can imagine and I know they do this on American citizens they are after. Knock out drugs such as scopolomine are used.
