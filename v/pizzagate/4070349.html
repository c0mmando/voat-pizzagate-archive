<p><strong>Dalian Wanda</strong>, one of China\'s biggest conglomerates, has announced it is buying a majority share in the <strong>Swiss sports-licensing firm Infront</strong>, which manages multiple soccer broadcast rights in Europe and Asia. The group, which has interests in property, entertainment and media, will gain a 68.5 percent share and Bridgepoint, Infront’s owner, will receive a total of €1.05 billion ($1.2 billion) from the deal. Bridgepoint paid €550 million for the firm just four years ago.</p>
<p>...<strong>Infront was founded in 2002 by Nicole Junkermann and Robert Louis-Dreyfus, the late owner of Adidas.</strong> In 2011 it was awarded the contract to market the TV rights for the 2018 and 2022 FIFA World Cups, having originally held the global rights. It also markets the German national team’s friendly and qualifying matches, as well as the countries cup competition. More than half of Germany’s top-flight teams also have TV deals with the firm.</p>
<p>..With the new owners behind him, Mr. Blatter now wants to attack. “Together we will tackle diverse expansion projects with the goal of further developing our leading position in the global sports market.” He wants Infront to become the number one in sports marketing worldwide, and has agreed a five-year strategy with Wanda to make it happen.</p>

<p>Filings show BHR Partners winning a piece of several desirable transactions: a stake worth more than $900 million in a corporate spinoff of non-oil industry assets from China Petroleum &amp; Chemical Corp. ; a $10 million holding in China General Nuclear Power Corp., just before an initial public offering; and participation with a dozen other investment groups in a $4.4 billion privatization of a property business controlled by <strong>entertainment giant Dalian Wanda Group</strong>. For a time, BHR Partners held a stake in Didi Chuxing Technology Co., China’s dominant ride-hailing service, and has invested in a leading facial-recognition business, Megvii Technology Inc. BHR Partners has also launched a number of investment funds.</p>

<p><strong>Mr. Wang maintains a close relationship with the Chinese Communist Party.</strong> The New York Times reported in 2015 that relatives of high-ranking Party officials amassed a stake in the company prior to the IPO of Dalian Wanda which appreciated to over $1.1 billion when the company was listed. These relatives include Qi Qiaoqiao, the sister of Xi Jinping, as well as the daughter of Wen Jiabao..</p>
<p>In December 2015 Wang Jianlin bought 15a Kensington Palace Gardens, London, for GB£80 million. The house was previously lived in by the Ukrainian billionaire, Leonard Blavatnik, who rented it during lengthy works on the house he owns opposite</p>

            That's very interesting because Junkermann's UK government connections can be traced back to Cameron's government.

             The UAE Ministry of Education conferred an award of distinction for his service to education in the country; the Indian Government honoured him with the Padmashri Award – one of the highest civilian honours; he also received the Rajiv Gandhi Award for Eminent Educationist. Further to his untiring efforts, he was named UNESCO Goodwill Ambassador for Education Partnerships.

Everything above board and shipshape. Nothing untoward going on. All “compliance” boxes duly ticked....

             Studinski is connected with Prince Charles and Prince Harry via the Royal Foundation..The Royal Foundation has some interesting trustees. For example, Jamie Lowther-Pinkerton : He's also a trustee at the Varkey Foundation...
