            He was not a "random man." And the media never said he was.   Point me to an article that says that.  He wasn't there because of the State Department, he was there because of Virginia electoral politics.  He used to work for the Congressman in this district (who was also there.) He was a counter protester and he lives in Charlottesville and was live tweeting and filming all day.  The media found him because his video went viral.  That's why he was interviewed.  He was never pretending to be someone he is not and he was hiding his connections.  Look at his twitter bio.

             Video of car hitting anti-racist protestors. Let there be no confusion: this was deliberate terrorism. My prayers with victims. Stay home.

             The police have cleared the park and surrounding streets. Only real intervention I've seen from them. They basically ignored all the fights

Favorite moment so far- two white supremacists with wooden shields &amp; swords lept in terror as gay black man offered them a bottle of water.

Have seen deeply impoverished African states where police were more effective at anti-riot crowd control. These cops need better training.Brennan Gilmore added,

            Heard from others, (not confirmed), that his car was attacked by a mob. If I were stuck behind a car while being attacked by a mob there might be more dead. If there were no relevance to the above link, then why would they scrub his past? Now, I see the MSM is basically saying it is Trump's fault because he never denounced racism before today. Something stinks here, and many thank's to the autists at reddit and gumshoe.

             Why do you cc me this, do you think you are being censored by MF? Why am I on your radar. Cause When i posted about Von Hansen ceo at ALERTSENSE in Idaho, the guy from day before yesterday fighting with you about censorship, was kinda too much, I agreed with you later. He's still posting interesting things. Not going to mention said hyper person, but I couldnt follow what (I know you whos problem really is.) After all was that shitposting on my thread?, not sure cause I haven't had time or computer to follow up and read all that,
            </p>
            <p>
             What he/she/it was ranting:
"""""""https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/2056069/10148045 Everyone knows you are a pro-pedophile antagonist, so why are you still messaging me now harassing me whilst being the faggot claiming to be a victim afraid of me and running to the mods for help to censor all the while falsely claiming I'm going to kill you?"""""
            </p>
            <p>
             but I have deep respect for MILLENIAL FALCON cause that's what mods are dealing with. I am so thankful,  appreciative of this space and don't want to see people leave. Lots of times I can't get the text right, and im in learning and all this stuff. But it's important we have this critical resource. I can't thank the creators of voat enough. And it WAS  a David seaman post that informed about voat boat and gab.

              I value your opinion. More people involved in a discussion is always better than less. There is a constant issue of censorship here. It's because the line is so blurry between what is and is not Pizzagate.

               Great and Just looked at all your posts, and yes I value your input and intelligence.  IF it wasn't meant to be it has turned into a  psyop and, any limited hangout that has an opportunity to pop up, are fiercely popping up. Because just pizza means so many things it is blurry. I've heard that when the natives saw the Nina the Pinta and the Santa Maria they didn't see anything. They could not fathom big ships.

             While I am in general agreement with the basic premis of your point, I just wanted to point out that in my submission of the video of "Trish the Dish" the actress is speaking about pedophilia and entrapment and it's very similar to 'deep state' tactics as described by Georgie et al.  In the comment section, there are further pointers to men in Hollywood who are rumoured to be involved in pedophilia and there are references to the occult aspect as well of the comic superhero film genre

              That's exactly the kind of speech Smith-Mundt 2012 is trying to stigmatize. The application of Smith-Mundt was behind Edgar Maddison Welch storming Comet Ping Pong as well.

                Smith-Mundt is at the heart of Pizzagate. Smith-Mundt allowed the DC Metro police to stage a hoax which was Edgar Maddison Welch storming into Comet Ping Pong with an assault rifle "shooting" into closets looking for children.
               </p>
               <p>
                No one would ever do that. Welch role was an actor in an event that would brand any Pizzagate researcher as a crazed red neck.
               </p>
               <p>
                Smith-Mundt is at the heart of everything.

                   Yes.  Sandy Hook, or Handy Sook as Montagraph now calls it, definitely was a psyop.  I've followed a few in my time :)

            White supremacists &amp; the KKK have been having marches for years!  (As repugnant as they are).  It's called the 1st Amendment.  Charlottesville had months to prepare for this.  McAuliffe had local police and National Guard resources at his disposal.  The violence was, in my opinion,  purposely manufactured to draw a link to the President in order to further damage him and bring down his presidency.
           </p>
           <p>
            With the resources at McAulliffe's disposal, it should have made it simple to keep groups apart and allow for peaceful demonstrations on both sides.
           </p>
           <p>
            Has one MSM reporter suggested that violence was due to Governor's failure?
           </p>
           <p>
            Keep in mind Terryville McAulliffe is butt-buddies with the Clintons.

            This is hilarious, the corner yall have painted yourself into.

           <p>
            Jewish controlled MSM and "deep state" really want to discredit these white guys who were chanting "THE GOYIM KNOW"
           </p>
           <p>
            So the only way its PG related is because the (((deep state))) is a pathetic euphemism for those who control both to solidify narratives -- notice the Bible-thumper from North Carolina Edgar Maddison welch.
