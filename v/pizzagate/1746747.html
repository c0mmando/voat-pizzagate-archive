<p>&quot;Many pointed out the financial ties between Imgur and Reddit, with Reddit having made a monetary contribution to the site’s funding in April 2014. The service was originally conceived as a “gift to the Reddit community” when it was launched in February of 2009. It is also worth noting that Slimgur links were set to be auto-filtered if posted to Reddit, meaning they had to be manually approved by moderators. This was never publicly communicated.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;However, it didn’t end there. With talk of the Slimgur service being brought up and argued about between advocates of free speech and social justice warriors on Reddit, coincidentally indecent images of children were uploaded en masse to the service. After links were posted in the AMA, the service received a massive influx of traffic that the servers couldn’t cope with. When the site didn’t return, the creator of Slimgur contacted his hosting service. He was told on Friday 23rd October that the site was offline due to multiple reports of child pornography being uploaded.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;The site was back up and running within a few days of the attack, however they had to move to a new domain, sli.mg.</p>
<p>“Arvixe has locked our slimgur.com domain and slimgr.com domain,” he continued. “They are not making the transfer easy. When they terminated the account they have stopped forwarding emails from the registrant email to my personal inbox and I cannot confirm a transfer to a new domain registrar. I really just want to stop doing business with them but for some reason they’re making it incredibly difficult to sever ties.”&quot;</p>

              slimgur moved to sli.mg and was taken down again. The pizzagate investigation has had almost 0 progess since before the election. Before the election, all evidence was uploaded to slimg and was further progressed than now.
             </p>
             <p>
              Everyday I see threads being uploaded with "evidence" that was discovered, uploaded, and discussed before the election. This evidence was lost when sli.mg was attacked.
