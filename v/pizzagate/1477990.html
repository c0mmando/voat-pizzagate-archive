            I would only be in favor of it if the proceeds went to a vetted, trustworthy charity that works with victims of sexual abuse.

            I wouldn't wear it. Too many young and elderly friends asking questions, invitation for face-to-face trouble in public, and I want NO pizza-related anything on my clothing. I can't even eat the stuff anymore.

             You're right. Like I said, I didn't give it much in depth thought aside from the idea. I just initially thought it would be a good cause to get the word out.
            </p>
            <p>
             I went to my parents house and they had a big Christmas party tonight (my parents and their friends are extremely white, middle to upper class) and one of the older men there I know fairly well asked something to do with the election and why Donald Trump won, I started talking into it and I bring up the Norway news, and he was baffled and stunned. Then I started to explain how Norway is cutting 90% of their donations to the cf and at that point he was hook line and sinker interested in what I had to say. Throughout the night he kept bringing it up and I showed him some emails and he was completely confused as to what they were talking about, so I explained and he was mind blown.
            </p>
            <p>
             It's beyond real. But pizzagate is definitely taking a toll on me as I stay on it 10-16 hours a day. I want to give it up but it keeps drawing me back for whatever sadistic reason.
