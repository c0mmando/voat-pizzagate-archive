            It is helpful for us to know the ways various organizations direct their policies in regards to reporting this crime. Most organizations (religious, or otherwise) had fairly draconian policies for years. Since the 90s tho, many more popular organizations have adjusted their policies for zero-tolerance and transparency. JW’s did this in the 90’s too. I found the JW policy repeated in their magazines and on their website:
           </p>
           <p>
            (For sexual abuse) What can you do?
	.....call the police
           </p>
           <p>
            and it’s been that way since the 90s.
           </p>
           <p>
            There is some contention about the “two witnesses to an accusation” rule, for confronting a believer that is doing bad. They also apply that when there are disputes between each other, to avoid taking sides when situations are unclear. It seems the rule is being misapplied in some congregations to shield offenders from victim’s accusations. Bad.
           </p>
           <p>
            The second article states that the elders in the Netherlands don’t want to embarrass themselves with these crime reports... to keep things quiet, totally against what their HQ says. The organization makes it clear that they scripturally follow the law and respect authorities. It seems the Netherlands congregations and perhaps some local groups don’t agree with this. There should be consequences, IMO.

             JW theology specifically requires that problems be handled within the group.  In their worldview, national governments are the province of Satan.  Like, Satan runs the government.  This is also why they discourage members from joining the military.  I would be very skeptical of any outward public statement that encourages members to call the police; the police are an extension of the state, and therefore, under the influence of Satan.  Sometimes with these high control groups what is said in public is meant to distract from the truths said in private.
            </p>
            <p>
             Considering that there is variation in any group, there are probably JWs who would call the cops, and those who wouldn’t under any circumstances.  One would hope that most people would call the cops.
            </p>
            <p>
             The issue specific to JWs is that their theology blatantly and clearly discourages this sort of behavior.  Most mainstream Christian denominations do not have explicit religious guidance like this.  Cover-ups have happened elsewhere (such as in the Catholic Church), but that was not a result of doctrine being applied “correctly”.

             I agree that in most cases, it is not the fault of the entire organization, or at the worst, there is something in the organization that can be exploited by abusers.  Honestly, I think the only real exception (outside Islam) would be Scientology.  Their rules have codified abusive behavior and require victims to never report crimes to the authorities.

              I have talked with quite a few JWs. They all said the same about any crime: call police... excepting one, an ex-JW that stated that her congregation had a couple of pedo elders and that instructed that particular local group wouldn’t call.

              As to military services, you have a small part of the equation. The missing parts are based on having “love for one another” and on the principle of “live by the sword, die by the sword”. The international conventions are pretty impressive, to see black, Asian, Russian, Palestinian and Israeli JWs all hugging and happy together. It’s clear that they would never want to go to war against each other. I have never seen anything like that, not even among sports fans.

             We can't lump all JW together just like we can't lump all the mainstream christians , Catholics etc together . There are bad seeds in every bunch and the truth is being revealed rapidly without bias. No religion will be able to hide what God already knows .
 Thanks for explaining the 2 person rule . It makes so much sense to me in order to be fair and not take sides verses going to a priest and confessing sins that for sure get hidden , because you basically pay the priest off to keep quiet . Think about it .. some charge you for prayers , healing etc and the sinner feels better because he feels forgiven.. then keeps doing the same sins over and over because he can pay for Gods forgiveness. This is how it seems to me anyways . This has been my experience.

              Totally wrong. Simony is a grave sin that will get a Catholic priest excommunicated.

               Yea it is totally wrong but they do it .. I've known people to pay for prayers and confession. Are you saying they don't do it because it's a grave sin ?

                Yes. If caught, they will be booted from their position. Besides that, the Church teaches that simony invalidates the Sacrament...i.e. it is spiritually useless so there is no point in doing it anyway.

                 Wow so they obviously needed this specific law because of the ones that abuse it . Seriously though, this stuff goes on along with other crimes against humanity, all in the name of someone's religion . It's a fact . I'm not singling out catholic priests . Just speaking from experience. The only time I've ever had a member of the clergy concerned about my well being is when it was time to pay my 10% to the church . That to me was very telling . I know hundreds of people that have had the same experience.

              Confession is not a pay-to-play thing.  I don’t know why you’d think that.  No legitimate Christian organization charges its members to participate in services.  The Catholic Church does not deny confession to anyone, especially not due to lack of donations.
             </p>
             <p>
              You might be thinking of indulgences, but that shit’s been out pretty much since Martin Luther called them on it.
             </p>
             <p>
              There are scam artists out there who might charge for things like this, but it’s just that; a scam.

              It could work if it’s applied correctly. Recently, my mother-in-law threatened to accuse me of abusing my kids if I didn’t do what she wanted. I told her: “go ahead”! If she had thought I was bad, why did she wait ‘til now to accuse me? Well, it would be nice to recieve that benefit of the doubt, in this case. I was also struck with the need to be reasonable myself here. It’s a valid policy, IMO. Two witnesses... hmm. Reasonably, I am going to put more weight on the testimony of a victim, than on a 3rd party accuser (like my own mother-in-law). If I don’t know what to believe, I report the suspicious activity to the police and wait until there is more info (like a 2nd witness). Technically, this two witness thing isn’t even about crimes, tho. As far as I can tell, it’s about little disputes, or dealing with addictions or secret affairs or whatever.
             </p>
             <p>
              There have been a few victims coming forward, stating that their reports of abuse were quashed by a misapplication of this rule. That’s unfortunate. Evidence that even a seemingly reasonable policy can be abused by imperfect people. Any rule however, no matter how decent, is useless for those with evil hearts, IMO.

             All religions are compromised.  The heads of the religions are the ones that are involved in these nefarious activities.  The followers almost all of them have no clue as to what is going on.  Just like we were babes in the woods until we were red pilled.  Beyond disgusting.  Scientology, Catholic Church (Vatican), Evangelical, and we just had a post by

             about Jewish Rabbis in NY and their being protected.  This goes to the top.  Most of us know Jewish people from work, school, and have them as friends.  They know nothing about this.  Just as I have Catholic friends and they think I am nuts when I talk about the Vatican and Jesuits, etc.

              Exactly. If politics, education, the media, and so on have been compromised, what makes people think the religious institution hasn't been touched? It's been warped, twisted, and turned around to have the opposite effect, just like everything else. The government is comprised of a bunch of idiots wasting everyone's time and money, the education system churns out idiots, and the media promotes nothing remotely close to the truth. Religion is no different. The devil is "the great deceiver" after all. Everything has been made to serve that purpose.

               I would not be surprised if we already have seen the devil or his right hand man.  He sits in power in Italy at the head of the RCC.  Jesuits are suppose to be the Order of Jesus.  What a joke.  Jesu-it-s.  All along they have been playing a joke on us. Yes, the biggest trick they played on us was brainwashing us into believing the devil does not exist.
