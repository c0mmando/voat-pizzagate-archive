              They are disgusting humans(?)that prey on the weak. I did notice they didn't say if the victims were adults or children. I would say a combination of both. All of those organizations are filled with predators that suck the life out of those that are just trying to survive.

                Thanks. I'm not sure how I missed that or maybe I did see it.  Just like a minute ago I pulled up the video on the post about SS, but somehow I had this other video playing. The SS one played after it. You should watch this if you haven't seen it. This will change everything you know is the title. Blew me away. He admitted creating a monster, that is Fakebook and the damage it has had on society. He even bravely talks about the evil ones that control our world. Shocked!    What's really weird is the audience thinks he's joking. I see suicide in his future.

            When mm started running her mouth about everything against Pres.Trump, I started reading and looking into her. Just like with Michael Moore, Robb Reiner, Chelsea Handler, if you scratch away on the surface, her evildoings will be evidenced. Won't be watching this wedding, just like no nfl, no Olympics and no award shows. They all are Lucifarians.  Charlie Daniel said his hit wasn't just any Ole song. I believe him, I believe him.

            The extent of the PEDOCRACY just boggles the mind. 
Its like everywhere you turn or look there is another group of Pedos in a position of power.
How did they get there and why did we not know about it?

             It really seems to adhere to what went on in Bavaria and documented in the writings of Adam Weishaupt.
            </p>
            <p>
             A secret society where members put the agenda of taking over the world first. To accomplish the ruination of individual countries and establish global domination, they've been pushing ahead fellow members, and selecting them to infiltrate all levels of society. That includes positions of the highest echelons of power. Hence, the election of president and, yes, secretaries of state.

             THE DAD AND BROTHER ARE SKETCHY AS ALL HELL AND NEED OUTING/INVESTIGATING STAT

            Absolute links to drug running, gang banging and no-proof-yet-but-sure-it-will-come-out-seeing-as-Cali-and-mexico-are-involved, human trafficking.
           </p>
           <p>
            to be honest, knowing how investigative journalists work, I am sure they already know what the jig is but because of strict British reporting laws and threats from power lawyers (MADELINE MCCANN syndrome) they cannot print anything.
           </p>
           <p>
            I would give my right arm to know what the deal with the dad is. I truly don't understand how those folk think anything can be kept a secret in this day and age.
           </p>
           <p>
            Brits/anyone, any insights...??

             Are there any leads / suspicious things to go on? I'm willing to look, but all I've seen so far about her dad is that he was some director, won an emmy. Does he own shipping businesses? Point me in the right direction plz

              NOT a director; a lighting guy. DID he win an emmy? Why hasn't this been shown so far? Seems weird.

             <p>
              Just google the dad.He's never met Harry; he lives in seclusion in Mexico; he was pictured with $250K in cash by claiming he won the lottery but there is no record of it. Dig dig

            She is a professional 'yacht girl' so of course the royal family is just eating her up. All is not as it seems that's for sure. It's perplexing when they look so normal.I really think thats what separates us from them, they are able to act like, or truly, don't care. I think most of us were bred with so much EMPATHY that we can't imagine how this could happen in the world, but it does, and we gotta try to do our best to stomp these motherfuckers down.

             Definitely right.

            <p>
             Most of us use the Golden Rule in navigating the troubled seas of living on this planet. I would never think of wtholding food from someone to get what I wanted. I just wouldn't. It abrogates that individual having a choice. It's the same as holding a gun to someone's head. That's not choice either.
            </p>
            <p>
             But then we have these scumsuckers with no morals, scruples, or problem with forcing others to do their bidding by whatever means necessary.
            </p>
            <p>
             Yes, I would not have believed a human being could act that way. Now? Now I've been redpilled and would believe anything.

            What to say when there's nothing left to say.  Words don't come close.  Weak and pale compared to the situation to describe.  Maybe Travis Bickle, the De Niro character in "Taxi Driver" got about as close as anybody could:

           <p>
            <em>
             Listen, you fuckers, you screwheads. Here is a man who would not take it anymore. A man who stood up against the scum, the cunts, the dogs, the filth, the shit. Here is a man who stood up... Someday a real rain will come and wash all this scum off the streets.
            </em>
           </p>
           <p>
            I hope it doesn't take the same turn he took.  But that rain

             will come

            .  I'm convinced without any doubt.  Since I'm still at a loss for words, i'll let the Scripture finish the thought:  Lev.18[25]
            <em>
             And the land is defiled: therefore I do visit the iniquity thereof upon it,  and the land itself vomiteth out her inhabitants.
            </em>

             I think this level of depravity is incomprehensible to most. It's another reason why this is so difficult to uncover and make people see what is actually going on.
            </p>
            <p>
             Yes, it's faith time. It's the only thing that keeps me going, but even then ... when I read what is happening to the most vulnerable ... I feel despair.

             Yes, there is no bottom ... none. But you know, they're locked in their own hell. This game they're playing, for all the money and power and privilege, I would never wish to be any one of them. There's nothing the world could give me that would ease my conscience in taking part in such atrocities. It's not in me ... not in my heart ... and thank the Lord it's not.

                Exactly ! And all those poor girls look like they may know what's in store for them . They look half scared . Can you imagine being that little and having to go along with everything ? I'm sure the children have heard " boogie man" stories and Clinton and Frank G certainly fit the description.

                 I have secretly wished I could reach into my laptop and pull her out of that picture.  I would take her in a second and raise her as my own.  She is so precious.  I can't help it, I love all children.  No matter where they come from.  What scares me is that we can raise our children well, try to give them a clean and wholesome life, not much is needed.  A few outfits, clean simple food, lots of love, but then they get hold of them.  We have to keep them out of their mitts.  Bet BC and FG could not wait to get their mitts on that Little Girl.

                  Everything is so bass ackwards ! There are so many loving , caring people who are willing to care for these kids and give them a life like you mentioned .. simple simple simple ! Children are a gift from God and we are supposed to be gently and loving towards them . That picture could be interpreted that way " oh look how sweet BC cares about children " , when his mind is thinking something far different .

                   Oh yes, and you and I both know what he is thinking.  I will not print it here, for it will get locked in our minds.  Yes, they have Hijacked our whole Child Welfare System.  God, if we only had known what they were up to years ago.  I hated the Clintons starting after the Monica trials because I started hearing other things.  And her!  Standing next to him.  It was from then on that I knew they were Partners in Crime.  Only I did not realize that our children were part of it.  My mind could not go down into that abyss.  Now it has.

                    Yep same here! The day I heard about BC and ML I lost all respect for him ! Not because he made a mistake but HE was the POTUS and that broke my heart back then . But now I know that they are all in it together and it's them against us.

               There are more and more people finding out about this and them but yet no word from the MSM.  They have not only been paid off, but are under the Penalty of Death, imo.  They know what will happen to them if they open their mouths.  Yes, I truly believe Haiti is like their Candy Store. Yes,  I can just imagine Bill and Hillary's eyes when they first laid eyes on Haiti on their Honeymoon.    Like Kids in a Candy Store.

                    YES!  That is what I am saying.  UK is all over this but here in the US, Mum's The Word.  Nothing.  Bupkiss  and Zilch.  Nada.  The MSM is as quiet as a mouse.

                     Oh sorry I read it as no one is talking here lol - is millenial_vulcan the same as Millennial_F?  I was really thinking of M_F because he seems to not like the UK and I thought that was the same name whoops!

                      No  millennial_vulcan is a member and is not nor ever has been M_F.  I know I used to get corn-fused too.  I am glad I don't have to type MF anymore!

                 Oh yes, and if I may add to the Mix the Vatican is running the SRA as well.  The RCC with the Blessings of jorge bergoglio are raping and torturing children across the globe.  I believe these horrid crimes are sometimes taped and sold off as Snuff and CP.  SRA is their Dirty Little Secret they never want discussed.
