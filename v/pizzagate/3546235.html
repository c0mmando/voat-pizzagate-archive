<p>Besides No name (McCain) Q specifically seems to go after the Democrat party much more then the Republicans which worries me. What about Republican pedophiles in the past such as Dennis Hastert? Craig Spence? Those were confirmed Republican politicians who were pedophiles.</p>

<p>Yes while the National Guard is used for emergencies on U.S. Soil I hope this power is not abused. Jade Helm 15 comes to mind. The U.S. Military practiced invading American soil in 2015 in seven states.</p>

<p>I believe the Deep States original plan was, to start a second civil war or drop a virus then initiate Martial Law which will lead into an NWO. I hope that\'s not what Q is. A pro Martial Law psyop.</p>',

            Jesse Waters just now did a bit on his FOX show, subject: QAnon, with mentions of Epstein. Maybe not a big deal, but I don’t see MSM talking about QAnon much, if ever. He’s still talking about Epstein now, specifically, who were his pilots with mention of “who were the stewardesses,” Bill Clinton, was Hillary there?... Little black book...

            Also black people continue to be killed by US police forces with impunity. Similar to Jews in nazi Germany prior to WWII.

            Years ago, Kunstler (clusterfucknation.com) predicted "cornpone facism" with the rise of a savior leader.  I'm a Q believer,  but this warning is out there in the ether for us to acknowledge. Kunstler's writing has always been intriguing to me, amd I recognize value from evaluating his insights.

            I think what most people fail to realize is that it's not about right vs. left as this whole Q movement seems to be about.  It has always been, and always will be, about the top vs. the bottom and essentially God vs. Satan.  Satan is the ruler of this world and it is no wonder pedophilia, abuse, exploitation and satanic sacrifices run rampant among the the top "elite" - it's because they all draw power from the god of this world.  They want us to believe it's the left vs. right, the good conservative right vs. the "evil" progressive left and while they keep dividing us among ourselves, they continue to rule the world with laws to bind us in delusions so that we may all be lead astray.

            If you live in America it should not bother you, they have tried to initiate martial law and it failed, the landscape of America makes it difficult, I could see the urban areas would be easier to manipulate, the fact is there is an armed angry populace, unaware that it has less freedoms than the places it vows to democratize, it is a giant war game joke.

            gamepwn...........same concerns. Nazi Germany made similar excuses when they abused  Jews as our govt. half heartedly makes for abuse to blacks.  Blackwater trains FBI &amp; police...........also reps. are sent to Israel for training. So much like nazi germany.

            You are not following Q posts. I can tell by your lack of understanding. FYI Fiona Barnett is a trap but you probably can't wrap your head around her schemes. Not everyone who cries victim is a victim.  You have to learn to discern better.  You'll get a much clearer picture of today if you learn more about the past,  the further back you go the easier it is to understand.

            You are mixing up Qanons with Q.  If the drop isn't signed by Q, then it's not Q.  If it's Anonymous then it's an anon and it's speculative.  Don't get side tracked.  Q is real,quote "Second my own distrust of the government. Q has said most of our institutions are corrupt and will need to be arrested. Their first post talked about the National Guard locking down major cities to stop once mass rioting occurs when Hillary Clinton is arrested.

            unquote  Q is not a their (they're) and Q did not post that, an anon did.  Another comment you made concerning Q supporting martial law:  quote  Q post 2460 talked about Martial Law.

            unquote  Defining what martial law is, doesn't mean Q supports it.  Talking about it doesn't mean Q supports it, but martial law DOES HAVE IT'S PLACE AS DEFINED IN LAW, and should be used when needed.  Should riots, blm, thugs, gangs, antifa take over the streets and threaten safety, then yes martial law should be imposed and there's nothing wrong with it.  The problem with martial law is when 'it's not lifted'.

            I never got the sense from any of Q's mentions of martial law that he supported it or thought it was a good idea. I remember that weekend. I told my daughter in Portland to stay off the street because riots were likely after Q made those posts. She told me that there was supposed to be a big ANTIFA thing, but no one showed up for it. That happened in several major cities as I recall. I've always had the sense that whole initial round of "breadcrumbs" when he was still "breadcrumbs anon" was a bit of a trial balloon playing chicken with the DS.
           </p>
           <p>
            My biggest concern is what's happened to Assange. If he doesn't get his freedom, it will confirm the naysayers.

             I agree. The martial law stuff was more to get people prepared in case things got really bad. It’s impossible to predict how the citizens of a country will react especially when finding out how corrupt your government really is. Nothing wrong with being prepared for the worst.

           <p>
            I had similar thoughts and questions (that's why Paul Serran blocked me)...
           </p>
           <p>
            But I, like you, always hoped and still hope that this is not true.
           </p>
           <p>
            I am a Q-Anon from day 1 and a follower till now. But I also have questions!
           </p>
           <p>
            And why do I still think that Q is a good thing?
           </p>
           <p>
            Because:  WHY?
           </p>
           <p>
            WHy starting such a "PsyOP", when they could have had their pedo-ruled-NWO with stupid media manipulated sheeple without it? We we were on the best way to the NWO before Trump and Q.
           </p>
           <p>
            Remember the warmongery politics of Obama and the Clintons? I really was afraif they would start a war with Russia because of Ukraine or Syria. And a big war would be the best opportunity to install martial law!
           </p>
           <p>
            Martial law?
           </p>
           <p>
            They could have had much more easy - just start a bigger war with Russa, spread diseases, or  let the economy decline and then cause some unrest - by maybe stirring up some racial riots or something like this.
           </p>
           <p>
            Why risking that people start to empower themselves by allowing them to "awake"?
           </p>
           <p>
            No matter, what we still think, what Q's real intentions might be - but since then people have been started digging and waking up.
           </p>
           <p>
            Why should they be interested in us waking up?
           </p>
           <p>
            They could have had their NWO much easier.
           </p>
           <p>
            And, about the torture at military bases... I thought about this as well.  But who says, that  WHOLE military belongs to white heads?
           </p>
           <p>
            Black heads are everywhere, also in the military.
           </p>
           <p>
            Until now I think that the Q-Group is really small. Maybe just very few people.
           </p>
           <p>
            And the military also ist full of pedos, clowns and other swamp creatures.
           </p>
           <p>
            Guess Q-people had to find out, whom they could trust...
           </p>
           <p>
            Something else, that worries me more, is that Q seems not to notice the nonces at Republican site.
           </p>
           <p>
            And we did not yet hear much about "Bohemian Grove".
           </p>
           <p>
            Or Henry Kissinger or Dick Cheney - or 9/11.
           </p>
           <p>
            These are people where I think, they are probably worse than the Clintons.
           </p>
           <p>
            The Clintons are disgusting, but also pretty stupid. They are easy targets.
           </p>
           <p>
            The really tough ones are Kissinger, Cheney, Rumsfeld... and old Bush.
           </p>
           <p>
            But Bush is dead, NoName is dead... so maybe they let them sneak out by "dying"...?
           </p>
           <p>
            But to really "change" the minds of the public, the public needs to know about their crimes.
           </p>
           <p>
            Can we trust Trump? he is not a saint, he never was.
           </p>
           <p>
            I don't know how close his "friendship" to Epstein was.
           </p>
           <p>
            But maybe he was "chosen" for the president job,because is not a saint. Because he "Knows" these people. Because he has been partying with them, because he knows, what they are doing.. and becase he knows how to deal with it.

            'Military is saviour, Trump is saviour'. (Q)
           </p>
           <p>
            Yeah, right. Trump supporters in the Military Industrial Complex like Erik Prince, who knowingly employs pedos, and who did business with Dyncorp, which has a history of sex trafficking of minors, are rolling on the floor.
           </p>
           <p>
            And pedo voyeur Trump, who walked into the dressing room of his Miss Teen beauty pageant while the girls where naked, and  even bragged about it on tape. A man who has been friends with sex traffickers and child rapists all his life.
           </p>
           <p>
            Craig Spence, whom you mention in your OP, ran a sex trafficking operation, and was a good friend of Trumps's friend and mentor Roy Cohn, who also ran a child rape sex trafficking operation.
           </p>
           <p>
            Former Trump advisor Steve Bannon said 'Satan is good', and that he (Bannon) wanted to destroy the government.
           </p>
           <p>
            Trump also appointed Acosta, who gave Epstein the lenient plea deal, Steve Mnuchin, a swamp creature, and Mike Pompeo, former head of the child rape and sex trafficking operations of the CIA.
           </p>
           <p>
            Shame on him and on anybody who defends him. He is a sick creep.

             Erik Prince doesn’t work for Dynacorp. He owns Blackwater Worldwide which is a security firm. They were given a private contract in Afghanistan as was Dynacorp. Stephen Feinberg owns Dynacorp. Erik Prince is also the one who told everyone about damning evidence on the Weiner laptop. So yeah...
            </p>
            <p>
             Next your picture of Trump supposedly staring at a underage girls breasts. How exactly do you know what he is looking at?  You can’t even see his eyes. Just saying it’s flimsy evidence at best...
            </p>
            <p>
             A friend of a friend is evidence of Trumps pedophilia?  Get real you are reaching...
            </p>
            <p>
             Steve Bannon never said “Satan is good”. He did say “Darkness is good” which I agree is strange. The interview was done by The Hollywood Reporter and is so chopped up you don’t really know what he is referring to but reading the whole paragraph seems like he may have been implying that Darkness is good when are on the side of good. Here is the full out of context quote...
            </p>
            <p>
             Darkness is good," says Bannon, who amid the suits surrounding him at Trump Tower, looks like a graduate student in his T-shirt, open button-down and tatty blue blazer — albeit a 62-year-old graduate student. "Dick Cheney. Darth Vader. Satan. That's power. It only helps us when they" — I believe by "they" he means liberals and the media, already promoting calls for his ouster — "get it wrong. When they're blind to who we are and what we're doing."
            </p>
            <p>
             Who knows what the hell he is talking about because it all taken out of context.
            </p>
            <p>
             It’s was revealed earlier this year in documents from the FBI that Acosta gave Epstein his deal at direction from the FBI (Mueller was the head of the FBI at the time) because Epstein turned snitch and was working with the them.  All Acosta is actually guilty of is doing as he was told.
            </p>
            <p>
             I picture of Melania with Prince Andrew is not evidence that they are pedos. This is many researchers biggest downfalls in the Pizzagate community IMO. Sure a picture can give you a clue as to who is guilty and who is not but in no way is proof of any wrong doing. Show me their names on the flight logs. Show me video of them at Epstein’s Manhattan estate. Is there evidence that Trump went to Zorro ranch?

             <p>
              Not the first time, it's happened many times and I've pointed out the misleading statements several times but that bias presented as though it's fact has become ingrained on PG, and other users that hate Q and hate Trump have become little better than the SJWs imho, attacking and trolling Q/Trump supporters who post on PG in order to distract and derail "good faith" discussions.
             </p>
             <p>
              Some Anti Q and Trump faction on PG rely a lot on conclusions based on emotion and unsubstantiated and/or outright false connections and similar to MSM, there has developed a sense of entitlement to set the narrative about Trump and Q while whining if other users take issue if people respond.   If some of these users aren't here on behalf of Share Blue, then they are saving David Brock money by creating an environment PG that is divisive enough to derail research.

              It's obvious that Trump is staring at her breasts, and you forgot to comment on him walking into the dressing room, and even admitting it. Which is clearly pedophile behaviour. But whatever.

               His reply destroyed your flimsy argument. OP is talking about how he is rightfully wary of "Q" and then you weigh in about how Trump is a bastard and a pedo. You get called out on your lies, misquotes and misrepresentations and your reply to that is that everyone else is a deranged Trump supporter? I hope you enjoyed your $0.74 , dirty glowing shill

               Attack the argument not the user. Pretty childish rebuttal you just made.
              </p>
              <p>
               Is it obvious that Trump is staring at her breast’s?  Is it really?  I looked at it the picture and no it’s not obvious. As long as it fits your narrative though right. Once again you can’t even see his eyes. So no it’s not obvious. But yeah whatever makes your point. Show me a video of that pic and maybe you can prove me wrong. Until then you got nada.
              </p>
              <p>
               Oh no did I misspell Dyncorp?  At least I know Erik Prince never worked for them. Pretty trivial given that you claimed he did.
              </p>
              <p>
               In a movement that is about figuring out the truth of our twisted society, facts DO MATTER. All you did above was spout lies and assumptions. Literally almost everything you stated is proven false or isn’t actually proof of anything.
              </p>
              <p>
               Now with that being stated do I need to try harder?  Or do you maybe need to do better research and not cherry picking info that you feel fits your narrative?  Like I said before give me anything that is actual proof that Trump is a pedo and I will shut up.
              </p>
              <p>
               Now run along and do some actual research little one...

                Alinsky would be so proud of you. Attacks me ad hominem, but still no word about Trump admitting to walk into the dressing room of teenage girls when they were naked.

                 Pretty sure you are the one spreading false information and that’s the end of story.  You clearly “think” you have me with your dressing room story huh. Pretty giant leap in logic if you ask me.
                </p>
                <p>
                 Here is my confession...  years ago I walked in on my sister naked.  According to your “logic” I am guilty of incest?  Get real. Did he walk in a take a seat and enjoy the show?  Nope.
                </p>
                <p>
                 So go ahead revert back to name calling because you once again you can’t defend any of your statements as true or fact.
                </p>
                <p>
                 I suggest you take your own advice and “think”. This has been a giant waste of time but totally worth it to call out your bs.

             How many times has pizzagate mods deleted posts from genuine pizzagate researchers because their post didn't  meet pizzagate standards or rules. Turned away a huge following because of it? So downvote this! You're hypocrites pretending to be holier than thou.
