            I just began a reply to you on your link and lost it... will try to begin again ...
           </p>
           <p>
            However, as for this, in citing organized patriarchal religion you return to the fact that the
Old Testament was written to cement patriarchy and to create an "all male god."
The Old World Religions had NO "Devil" and NO "Satan" and NO "Hell."
           </p>
           <p>
            These are inventions of male-supremacist religions in order to frighten them members.
FEAR is the basis of mind control.
           </p>
           <p>
            And, it would be impossible to miss the fact that it was intended to cause the de-powering of 
women in these societies which it seems "Jesus" was rebelling against. 
The order was changed from being centered in matriarchy to patriarchal rule.
           </p>
           <p>
            I've looked at the WikiLeaks link and see nothing about pedophilia ...
maybe I missed it and I'll look at it again.
           </p>
           <p>
            But CHURCH/TEMPLE are certainly involved in a war on women in order to gain
access to children and to sexually abuse children.  Women had to be de-powered to do that.
           </p>
           <p>
            Also remember that the RCC wasn't too happy that they were dependent upon the Old Testament/Hebrew
to authorize their "all male god."  They had to preserve that authority while also demeaning and debasing Jews.
           </p>
           <p>
            Recall that the Vatican held Jews in Jewish Ghettoes for 1,100 years or more until they were shut down first
by the French and then by the Italians who moved the Vatican back into the one square mile it now occupies.
           </p>
           <p>
            During that time in the Papal States, the Vatican wrote vile propaganda about Jews which was circulated
throughout the Papal States by Church periodicals and preachings.
            <br/>
            Jews were forced to wear yellow stars and isolated from society, barred from education and professions
They were also the victims, of course, of the Inquisition.
           </p>
           <p>
            The citizens in these Papal States had long been flooded with anti-Jewish propaganda which set the 
stage for what eventually happened -- the Jewish Holocaust in Germany.

            Do you know how difficult it is to focus even on male violence in what is still a patriarchal society?
           </p>
           <p>
            Where would we begin to get MSM to actually admit and report that studies show that MALES are 
our sexual abusers of children?
            <br/>
            Despite this fact -- right wing women's groups agree that MALES are our sexual abusers of children:-
           </p>
           <p>
            <strong>
             Also :  The right-wing "Family Research Council" notes/confirms findings that "almost all child sexual abuse is committed by men."
            </strong>
           </p>
           <p>
            How often do males talking among themselves ever discuss male violence?
Actually many men fear the same violent males that women also fear.
           </p>
           <p>
            Also, if you're at all thinking this through you have to have concluded that this is the
cause of the "war on women" over the ages as women are the natural protectors of children.
           </p>
           <p>
            And is it women who sent children to work as "child labor"?
Actually Elites/wealthy would still be sending children to work at age 2 or 3 if they could.
Only a few regulations still stand to prevent that abuse of children.
           </p>
           <p>
            Actually, Clement Freud was Sigmund Freud's grandson
            <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/06/14/sir-clement-freud-exposed-as-a-paedophile-as-police-urged-to-pro/">

            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            There is NO doubt whatsoever either that CHURCH -- and male-supremacist religions are involved
in sexual abuse of children and cover it up.
           </p>
           <p>
            I will take another look at your Wiki info and be back to comment here.

            ESO --
           </p>
           <p>
            <strong>
             The point is that there is NO mystery about who is sexually abusing our children ...
            </strong>
           </p>
           <p>
            and who has been doing just that through the ages.
           </p>
           <p>
            They are MALES and they are heterosexual males.
           </p>
           <p>
            Also NOTICE that sexual abuse of children is usually begun in the family by a MALE parent.
           </p>
           <p>
            All of the lies of patriarchy have to be reversed in order to understand reality --
           </p>
           <p>
            And you can start with Sigmund Freud's Oedipus Complex which made the outrageous suggestion
that it is infants, toddlers and young children who are the sexual aggressors against adults in their families --
fathers, uncles, grandfathers, male cousins -- and male friends of the family.
           </p>
           <p>
            Freud betrayed his young patients who had confided in him their sexual abuse by MALE members 
of their families.
           </p>
           <p>
            And today it is generally suspected that Sigmund Freud, himself, was a pedophile.
           </p>
           <p>
            There is a lot of reading to be done on this subject of pedophilia and those who sexually abuse children.
It is thought that pedophiles actually have no sexual orientation.
Heterosexuals are "situational" pedophiles, i.e., men who prefer sexual relations with females, but when
there is no female available, they will sexually abuse a child.
           </p>
           <p>
            Just consider, in fact, our prisons where we have 200,000 or more rapes of men by men.
And when these men leave these prisons one of the first things these rapists do is rape a 
female in order to prove their manhood.
Further proof of this is that it is female prisoners who are bartered and sold to male prisoners, guards, etal.
Most of the victims of sexual abuse -- young and old -- are female.
           </p>
           <p>
            You can study the Canaanites 'til the cows come home, but if you don't understand that 
our sexual abusers of children are MALE and generally family members or friends of the family,
then you will fail to properly protect your children from sexual abusers.
           </p>
           <p>
            And of course the Vatican/RCC is deeply involved in the sexual abuse of children
all over the world.

            If you truly want to protect children you need to know who our sexual abusers of children really 
are and you can't ignore the reality that they are MALES and they are heterosexual males.
           </p>
           <p>
            Women will sexually abuse children, but it is usually connected to their being influenced by a heterosexual male.
           </p>
           <p>
            Homosexuals are 100X LESS likely to sexually abuse a child.
Homosexuals seek relationships with other adult males.
           </p>
           <p>
            You seem to think the world is run by NAMBLA.
           </p>
           <p>
            Throughout history, homosexuals have been persecuted by the Catholic Church to the point where
the RCC could even convince parents to abandon their own children and toss them out of their homes
if they suspected they may be homosexuals.
           </p>
           <p>
            Hawaiians, however, before the coming of the "white man" held homosexuals in high esteem and
honored them for their care of orphaned children.

            Is it any wonder why women destroy civilizations? Truth and righteousness don't matter. Their feelings and desires come first.

             The violent among us are MALES ...
Our sexual abusers of children are MALES ...
Our Founders created a system of Elite Patriarchy (Males) while proclaiming "All are equal" --
and redistributed the wealth of the nation to them via land grants, control over our people's government,
the nation's wealth and natural resources.
Elites patriarchy is underpinned by Organized patriarchy religion (male-supremacist religion) which also
created Capitalism - a system intended to move the wealth and natural resources of nations from the many to the few - and it has done that successfully all over the world.
Capitalism is an evil which cannot be regulated.
            </p>
            <p>
             Please make clear how you think women "destroy civilizations" ....
Women have been oppressed by male violence all over the world for tens of thousands
of years.

            Since our sexual abusers of children are MALES which even right wing women's groups agree with,
it makes clear that the power of Elite Patriarchy is used to protect pedophilia.
           </p>
           <p>
            And especially to de-power females/mothers who would normally protect these children.
           </p>
           <p>
            Likely that's what the "War between the sexes" has always been about.
           </p>
           <p>
            Here's one of the studies which makes clear that it is our Heterosexual Males
who are the sexual abusers of children . . .

            ** "Focus on the Facts" -- Sean Cahill, PH.D**
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             A 1998 Study in the Journal of the American Medical Association found that 90% of pedophiles are men, and 95% of these individuals are heterosexual.
            </p>
            <p>
             Research has indicated that gay men and lesbians are less likely than heterosexual to sexually abuse children.
            </p>
            <p>
             Perhaps the most egregious and damaging claim promulgated by anti-gay groups is the claim that homosexuality is intrinsically linked to pedophilia and child sexual abuse.  The social science research on sexual orientation and child sexual abuse clearly disproves the claim that homosexuals are more likely to molest children.
            </p>
            <p>
             A 1998 study in the Journal of the American Medical Association found that 90% of pedophiles are men, and 95% of these individuals are heterosexual.  One researcher explained this statistic by noting, "Gay men desire consensual sexual relations with other adult men.  Pedophiles are usually adult men who are sexually attracted to pre-pubescent children.  They are rarely sexually attracted to other adults.  In fact, research has indicated that gay men and lesbians are LESS likely than heterosexuals to sexually abuse children.  Two studies that examined the sexual orientation of convicted child molesters found that less than 1% in one study and 0% in the other were lesbian or gay.  One psychologist reviewed the existing social science literature on the relationship between sexuality and child sexual abuse and found that "a gay man is no more likely  than a straight man to perpetrate sexual activity with children."  Further, "cases of perpetration of sexual behavior with a pre-pubescent child by an adult lesbian are virtually nonexistent."
            </p>
            <p>
             Gay rights activists, like all advocates for children's welfare, oppose child sexual abuse and support equitable age of consent laws that help prevent and punish such abuse.
            </p>
            <p>
             At least 110,000 children are waiting to be adopted in the US.  Approximately 588,00 children are currently in foster care.  Barring gay men and lesbians from adopting or foster parenting decreases the number of potential suitable homes for children in need.
            </p>
            <p>
             Children who remain in foster care for much of their childhood, as do tens of thousands of American children, are more likely to have emotional problems.  Some children in foster care live in 20 or more homes by the time they reach the age of 18.  Barring gay men and lesbians from adopting or foster parenting is not simply unjust and unethical; it also decreases the number of potential suitable homes for children in need.
            </p>
            <p>
             Research shows that children raised by gay and lesbian parents are not disadvantaged vis-a-vis their peers raised by heterosexual parents.

           </p>
           <p>
            A review of 352 medical records of children evaluated for sexual abuse during a 12-month period at a Denver children's hospital found that less than 1% had been abused by a gay man or a lesbian.  Of 269 adult perpetrators of child abuse identified among the 352 cases of abuse, only two were  gay or lesbian.  The vast majority of the children in the study (82%) "were suspected of being abused by a man or a woman who was, or had been, in a heterosexual relationship with a relative of the child."  And the review concluded that in this sample, " a child's risk of being molested by his or her relative's heterosexual partner is over 100X greater [than the risk of being molested] by someone who might be identifiable as being homosexual, lesbian, or bisexual."

            In an earlier study of convicted male child molesters in Massachusetts, none of the 175 men were found to have an exclusively homosexual adult sexual orientation or to be primarily attracted to other adult men.
