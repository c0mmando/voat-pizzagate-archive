<h2>               Fake Terror leads to Fake Reporting leads to Fake News lead to Real Killing</h2>
<p>Fake Terror is done to justify the War on Terror. But unfortunately all that Ersatz Terror has a business end and that\'s to justify the REAL killing that goes on in the Middle East. That upsets DarkMath greatly because DarkMath doesn\'t like to see people killed, good or bad, friend or foe. DarkMath learned this a long time ago when after graduating from college and having a European History degree couldn\'t find gainful employment on Wall Street due to his dirth of psychotic personality traits which made job interviews long, tedious and insouciant enough to get him exactly zero job offers. So DarkMath tried out the Marine Corp with little success. But not because he was a coward, he wasn\'t. He just found out during the first 2 weeks of OCS that he was more afraid of killing other people than being killed himself. See when you sign your name on a dotted line in that outfit they expect you to be available at any time to kill anyone for whatever reason they provide, good or bad. When you sign on that dotted line you gotta be ready with a plan &quot;Be polite, be courteous but have a plan to kill everyone you meet.&quot;. But the Marine General is only following orders too. He gets \'em all the way from the top. But if you don\'t respect the President who may ultimately tell you to kill.....well..........that really fucks with your head.</p>
<p>So DarkMath dropped out of OCS. Killing is necessary but DarkMath harbored a Pacifist deep down inside. Long fucking story...I loved and wished I could have served in the Marines to this day but it just wasn\'t in the cards for me mentally. Just know I wasn\'t a coward. There is no enemy in boot camp.</p>
<p>So moving on, this is important for context. Everyone knows Manchester looks like the Fake Terror attack referenced months ago in that haunting video Cicada released where if you play the backwards audio forward it says expect a Lion to roar and basically WWIII to start on June 1st.</p>
<p>Well the Lion isn\'t Israel. The Lion in European History was, is and will forever be England. In fact you might remember from the Wizard of Oz a cowardly Lion. He symbolized England. The Tin Man represented the American industrial worker and the Straw Man the American farmer. The Yellow Brick Road represented the Gold Standard and Dorothy\'s Silver Slippers(in the book her slippers are Silver not Ruby) represent the Silver Standard. The Yellow Brick Road and Silver Slippers combine to represent Bi-Metalism. Please see Bill Still\'s excellent documentary <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sboh-_w43W8">The Secret of Oz</a>.</p>
<p>So the Lion is England and the roar looks to be them pleading with NATO to help them invade Syria because obviously 19 Ariana Grande fans where blown up yesterday and 59 grievously maimed <a href="https://youtu.be/NBhdl3a_m4k?t=98">despite clear evidence to the contrary</a>................all so Killary &amp; Co can finally build that oil pipeline from the Persian Gulf to Europe via Syria who\'s a Russian ally and couldn\'t be bought off evidently, I have no idea. War fucking sucks is all I know and they\'ve been trying to get that pipeline through since 1986. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/georgwebb/search?query=pipeline">See George Webb\'s excellent videos on that subject.</a></p>
<p>These fucking psychopaths are trying to start WWIII in Syria not because of Terrorism or Islam or any other bull shit reason other than mother fucking money. And if we don\'t do something about it real fucking fast we\'ll soon be in a world of shit. Send this to everyone you know..........real fucking fast.</p>
<p>This isn\'t about Terror. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2itQkiQUOE">This is about a Cowardly Lion who couldn\'t roar.</a></p>

            was just pissed off I suggested John Podesta plea bargain down so we can find out who he's working for. I won't make that mistake again. People want John Podesta drawn and quartered.

            narcissist - Yeah I gotta call you out on this one. I'm about as far away from being a narcissist as you can get. Trust me when I tell you my opinion of myself is far worse than anyone here thinks. I'm only here due to the Grace of God who decided I could hang out a little longer provided I keep going

            You must not have sisters and/or be American. Madeleine Albright is the patron saint of the college educated portion of the ""I am woman here me roar!(tm)" club.

           <p>
            Sorry I don't concede your point. And frankly the very fact you're trying to deny American women are capable of voting for a candidate solely based on the ratio of X to Y chromosomes means your grasp of reality is tenuous.............which is kind of how this whole thing started but I can't fix stupid.

            Spring is the Satanic "season of sacrifice".  See Mark Passio's video and start at about 2:14:00 for maybe 10 minute discussion of the occult calendar (the whole video is long but well worth watching the whole thing.)

            Also, DarkMath, check out Mark's video on Wizard of Oz.  He has a different take on the symbolism in the movie.  I found your interpretation fascinating. Maybe you would like to see Mark's alternate interpretation.

            William Jennings Bryan was a populist hero. Far from a coward they viewed WJB as a righteous soldier of Truth in the fight against the East Coast banking elites and their puppet masters in the City of London.

             WJB is pretty much summed up in his "Cross of Gold" speech.

            Nice job DarkMath. I heard some of that about the Wizard of Oz, but not that much detail. And you're right. We all need to pray. Very dark times ahead.

               I soon as I had typed in "And Amen" I knew you'd think I thought that's what AA meant. Nope, I've been in AA since 2005 and believe I know what AA means. "And Amen" was just a coinkydink, totally random.
              </p>
              <p>
               One thing you realize though when you get sober and stop playing the role of God in your own life which many people suck at including me is that there are an awful lot of coinkydinks in life that make you wonder.
              </p>

               I'll leave it at that.

              Im just having fun making a meme from a quote from DarkMath. But to answer your question.. Spirit-u-ality. Your spirit is an actuality. In other words Spriituality is the knowing that you are spirit.. that you are eternal beingness, and that this body you are occupying is a temporary vessel.. a physical avatar which you have contracted into occupying in this physiucal reality until it expires and you, your spirit continues on to eventually occupy another physical vessel either by choice or by trickery. (Spirit recycling system)

                Drink more and do more drugs and watch a bunch of people die then get sober and watch more people die and then read a bunch of quotes like the following and you'll start believing there's more to the story than we're picking up.

                 I believe indeed there's a lot that "people aren't picking up on." But there's an objective guideline to prevent us from going off the rails.To keep everyone from believing only "that which is right in their own minds" and hearts. That leads to moral relativism. Sinful man by nature abhors that authority though. But we've discussed this before.

                 You would do well to check into Tyson, he's a disinfo artist and conman, NASA gatekeeper, shill, and pseudo-scientist. You were redpilled relatively recently about Sandy Hook. It's time to dig deeper.

                  Already have. Re-read the Heisenberg quote, the smartest minds in History have consistently objected to being called Atheists because encoded deep down in the mathematics underlying our Universe are things that can't be random. The Cosmological Constant is one, the Error Codes Prof William Gates at U. of Maryland discovered while working on Super Symmetry theory is another etc etc. The list goes on and on.

                  All I know is you and me and a lot of people know there's more to the story.  We just disagree on the minor details but that's ok, no one has a lock on the absolute truth.

                    They were 100% real. The mood landing conspiracy is classic CIA disinfo to attack the credibility of people who question the other stuff that IS faked like Lee Harvey Oswald being the lone gunman all the way up through Sandy Hook and coming to a gentle Greyhound bus rolling stop engaging the air brakes outside an Ariana Grande concert in Manchester England.
                   </p>

                    In fact the CIA invented the term "conspiracy theorist" just for this purpose. They play 5d chess at that level. And I'm not bragging, I went to an Ivy League college and spent 4 years with some of the 0.00001%. They're almost a different species of human being. It's that bad.  They'll never get caught because they're at least 11 moves ahead of everyone all the time. Hillary &amp; Co are what precipitated out of their wake. They're long gone by now. Hilary &amp; Co are the fall guys, the bag men.

                    And it's not "The Jews(tm)". Far from it. If anything "The Jews(tm)" are trying to help bring this down, or at least their share of it. They all play both sides of the table up there. No one is free of sin in this cluster fuck.

                    The problem is the people at the top are Elite Atheists of every stripe. Deplorable Shit Lords barely register as human beings to them. Marie Antoinette wasn't Jewish.

                    Hillary Clinton looks to be some type of witch or Satanist, she ain't Jewish. Louise the 16th sent her family here to settle the new world........with pure bred French cunt demons for some reason but that's ok. We're here now, let's make the best of it. Then there's Heir Hitler who may have been born with a tiny bit of Jewish blood in him but just like Stalin who had much more they dropped the Judaism long before they came to power. Hitler and Stalin were godless atheists and they took great pleasure in killing millions.

                    The problem at the top is Elitism-Atheism. It's now replaced Marxism-Leninism as the most annoying word contraction and the biggest threat to human life on planet Erf. It's not "The Rothschilds!(tm)". My guess is they'll be next on the chopping block to be honest. They came to power around 1750, that's practically yesterday in European History. I've got a sneaky feeling God has more that shall be revealed. Bee tee dubs I love His style. I kinda doubted the G-Rock early on. I definitely underestimated things by a country mile. Things are catching up real quick.

                      I've seen all the arguments. They're pathetic. One Flat Erfer I met here didn't understand how a rocket could have made it to the moon since there's no air in space.

                       How can a rocket fly through a vacuum w/ nothing to push against? The propulsion would spin it round and round, there would be no sense of direction. How does the "vacuum" of space keep from swallowing our "atmosphere." (You know a vacuum "abhors a vacuum" too you know?)

                       NASA admits itself that it can't get through the radiation of the (supposed) Van Allen Belt. It's on video. Why haven't we been back? Why hasn't the technology advanced? Why has there been no accidents? Why do pro photographers call fake on the Apollo photos? Where did all those moon rocks come from? Why did they tell Ron Howard when he wanted to make a movie that all the original films had been destroyed? Why is the number of official photos outlandishly more than what was claimed they took on the moon? Ever seen the clip of the Neil Armstrong press conference? How depressing? Why was Neil Armstrong so quiet all his life?

                        A rocket doesn't care if it's in a vacuum. In fact it's much more efficient in a vacuum because there's no resistance.

                           Your personality is funny. You take people straight for their word. You don't look for an angle. I was just kidding when I said I was angry. That's a good quality I think. Keith Richards said Jagger always looked for "an angle" from someone, never trusted, Richards said he just took everyone at face value till they proved otherwise.

            , I enjoyed reading, and there are a lot of like-minded people out there.  I am certain the last several months have been mentally and physically draining for many of us.  My mind has been spinning for months, and I refuse to let it overtake me at this point in my life.  With that being said, I feel the need to get some thoughts, incongruous as they may be, out in the open.  Commenters may criticize as they see fit, but that's okay, I still refuse to think that any of our hearts are in the wrong places.
           </p>
           <p>
            I completely understand the reasons for anonymity among all of us and that it is a neccessity to do so.  On the other hand, I can also clearly see a future need in which many of us could provide a tremendous benefit to people in our respective neighborhoods, farms, towns, and cities.
           </p>
           <p>
            What if nothing changes, and truly, do we expect anything to change?
           </p>
           <p>
            Assume a hypothetical event.  An intentional Real Flag occurs with chaos erupting.  Whatever this Real Flag brings, it will last for weeks or months, a hell-of-a-lot longer than it takes for roads to be cleared from a major snowstorm. It will affect a geograhical area, the eastern Atlantic Coast, encompassing all states and beyond.  Martial law ensues. The effects soon begin to spread across the nation. 
Can you envision a plan where we work together?  There is a huge talent base among us.  Maybe some of you live 5 miles away or are across the road from me.  At some point, before a Real Flag occurs, I forsee the need to find those nearby with like-minds.

            <p>
             There is 0.0% chance of nothing changing. These people know the gigs up. The only question is to what degree. They've already started pumping money down the mountain which we the great unwashed will be bathing in shortly. Soon they'll start throwing "persons of interest" over the wall directly. Then they'll call some audibles based on the state of affairs this Fall and to be honest I hope they call the right plays because this cluster fuck has some toxic bile way down deep that no one including yours truly knows what the fuck is going to happen to.

             I prayed twice today already and will probably get another check up from the neck up later tonight. That's as much as I got right now.

               And just in case you're an atheist you don't have to believe in God to pray 13Buddha. You can pray to anything you want. At this point it couldn't hurt, it'd give your brain 5 minutes of rest.

             The beautiful and succulent morsel of truth behind the "Basket of Deplorables" brain fart is had she hired just one lower middle class heterosexual white male with a college degree to just listen in on meetings with their mouth wired shut and only allowed to communicate through some elaborate veto button her infamous IT staff could have stuck together with bubble gum and duck tape she'd have been alerted to the numerous piles of dog shit best given a wide birth. But nothin' doin', she stepped in every one. She just couldn't let that class of human being back in the tent. That little bit of poetic justice will resonate in American History for a hundred years.

            I think this whole world right now is like a pimple getting ready to pop.  It is coming to a head and we all need to be ready for whatever is thrown our way. These false flags are just about beyond comprehension.  It all boils down to greed and power, using whatever means necessary, i.e., killing innocent people, causing extreme suffering among the masses through starvation, poverty, disease, etc., to accomplish their goal. I am glad people are continuing to wake up.  We can never give up exposing and eliminating this evil.  If necessary give your life up.  If it comes to that I plan on taking a few of those assholes with me. Remember, there are more of us than them.  I like those odds. Up voat for you DarkMath!

            "Well the Lion isn't Israel. The Lion in European History was, is and will forever be England."
           </p>
           <p>
            As a half Jew, you should know better.  Oh wait -- you're an ignorant retard!
           </p>
           <p>
            The LION is the symbol of the TRIBE OF JUDAH (Jews).  See the 12 Tribes of Israel.
           </p>
           <p>
            And YES, they are in England.  (See the British flag, the "union Jack" [Jacob].)  England is part of the UNITED KINGDOM, which is the western version (2.0) of the UNITED KINGDOM OF ISRAEL.
           </p>
           <p>
            ALL ROYALS ARE JEWS.  (This is in the BIBLE.)  That's why the LION OF JUDAH is in most royal heraldry.

            </p>
            <p>
             I wouldn't go so far. I only saw brave men. But I think I know what you mean. Many people who join the Armed Forces can't connect the dots as quickly as you and me. But that's not their fault. The tragedy is some not all find out in 2 years what I had the fortune to find out 2 weeks. Some but not all are so tortured by that new found knowledge it causes problems.
            </p>
            <p>
             When you join any of those outfits you realize the first week anyone you kill will spend the rest of your life in your head. So if you don't think the person you killed really deserved it then issues may arise.

              Steps to killing the Soul. Remove them from their loved ones (bootcamp). Make them afraid (4am mock drills). Feed them a poor, hi carb diet (to further destroy their thinking abilities). These are basic steps to destroying higher Will Power, and making armed meat robots that will do anything for a paycheck.

            Look a little further and you'll find that the Knights of Malta (SMOM) are the organisation behind all of this. What you're referring to is the City of London, which is the banking and media arm of the Vatican. It's not really "Britain" or "England." London is just one of the admin bases for the dark side of the Roman Catholic church.

            totally agree. Even if it is "real terror" it was trained and set up for a reason last night just in time for the whole CIA Brennan &amp; Comey massive leaks side show on capital hill right now.

             There is 0.00000% chance that was real terror. I hope England stored up some money because they and the State of Connecticut are going to be ripped a new financial ass-hole when it's all said done.

            <p>
             I didn't reverse the audio. I just saw a video from someone who'd done it. I just went to look but couldn't find the video I watched. You should be able to find it if you look. As I recall it had "Remember the Future" in it as well as Lion and the word "May" for Teresa May who looks to be the mother fucking cunt demon who's behind this current cluster fuck.

             I have a sneaky suspicion women are going to have a very hard time getting elected to office now that Hillary Clinton and Terresa May have been exposed as Satanic Cunt Demons.

              Oh FFS. women aren't any more demonic than men. In the history of evil people, women only stand out more because they are statistically less significantly a mass murderer or evil power hungry demon. You have men doing this throughout the Millenia and yet somehow a few women get caught out and now all women are evil. No. Don't even go there. Try again. Most of the pedophiles and traffickers being arrested are men.

               That's a Straw Man. I'd argue women aren't any LESS demonic than men. That means fewer women in power mean your chances of encountering a bat shit crazy psychotic female go up not down.

                 You shouldn't get mad at me. Don't shoot the messenger. Hillary Clinton and Theresa May only got where they are because
                 <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/feb/06/madeleine-albright-campaigns-for-hillary-clinton">
                  there are women in this world who think people can be qualified for the highest post in the land based simply on the lack of a Y chromosome.
                 </a>
                 That's wrong and you know it. It's time women wake the fuck up to their bull shit. We almost eliminated all life on planet Earth due to their obnoxious habit of eluding accountability at all costs. That needs to change.
                </p>
                <p>
                 We elect people based on the strength of their character not their chromosomes. Half the reason we've gotten to this point in History is women think they get to live by different rules. Women are no different than men, no better no worse. The laws that apply to women should also apply to men and vice versa. This isn't complicated. Flush out your head gear because you're pissing me off.

                  Flush out my hear gear? Do you think I am a child? Go fuck yourself with a statement like that. 
How I am I pissing you off? 
you made a world wide corruption scheme both into your personal story and now about gender. WOW, talk about issues. You want to  lump all potential female candidates into Demonic cunts. I think you are making this into your personal agenda. There have been women elected as prime ministers and presidents for many many countries of the world and some have been good, some less good but that is true of male leaders as well. I have no idea how a statement like "there are women in this world who think people can be qualified for the highest post in the land based simply on the lack of a Y chromosome." is meant to convince me of garbage and I won't follow a blind link. You obviously have mental problems, so I'll assume you're off your meds and hope you are in  better place tomorrow.

                   The insanity that currently infects this country has many causes. One of the major ones is people voting for people based on meaningless qualities like
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   1) The color of their skin.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   2) The presence or absence of a Y Chromosome.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   That's wrong.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   We shouldn't vote for politicians simply because they're white. Why should we vote for them simply because they're black?
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   We shouldn't  vote for politicians simply because they're
                   <s>
                    white
                   </s>
                   male. Why should we vote for them simply because they're
                   <s>
                    black
                   </s>
                   female?
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   The first step to getting better is admitting you have a problem. If there's one ray of light, one silver lining to all this insanity is maybe people decide to vote for someone based on their character and not on the color of their skin and/or number of X Chromosomes. You might as well pick people based on their waist size or lactose intolerance.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   If you pick politicians for insane reasons you will get insane results.

            The CPP psy-op was there to distract from minor and repairable hull breaches only. But these mother fuckers drove too close to an Iceberg at full speed but not close enough to stop outright if you know what I mean. We The People ripped a hole the entire length of the hull and they're taking on water fast. If they don't do something quick.......oh fuck it.........there ain't anything these psychotic mother fuckers can do now.

             Thanks for pointing me to that article. That was righteous and truthful beyond measure.
            </p>
            <p>
             There's only one thing I'd object to and that's:
            </p>
            <blockquote>
             <p>
              Isa = Christ
             </p>
             <p>
              Lamb = The Sacrifice of Isa
             </p>
             <p>
              Isalamb = Islam
             </p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>
             I'm pretty sure that the word "Islam" literally means "Surrender". I had a link referring to that fact a while back. It had an example of an Arabic speaker talking in Arabic a sentence with the word "surrender" in it. I couldn't find the link but I'm almost 100% certain the word for "Surrender" in Arabic is "Islam".
            </p>
            <p>
             Other than that the post was a great read, thank you.

             Unfortunately, terrorists are on both sides of the aisle. If it was one-sided, it would be much easier to clean this up.
