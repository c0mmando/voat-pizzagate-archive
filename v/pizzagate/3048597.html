             I'm with you on this. Here's a story out of Las Vegas that is almost a carbon copy of this tale from Tampa, which no news agencies must be interested in because I can't find where anyone who has picked it up. Don't they want to find this foreign woman and the warehouse where these kidnapped victims are being held until the trafficking ship arrives? Strange.
            </p>
            <p>
             <a href="https://www.abcactionnews.com/news/national/woman-jumped-from-car-to-escape-fake-uber-driver-in-las-vegas">
              Las Vegas incident
             </a>
            </p>
            <p>
             It's also odd that the Uber driver and passenger's stories don't really match, and I just love how both of the women in the Tampa and Las Vegas stories were too scared to call the police. I would've dialed 911 and let the operator listen to me commanding the driver to stop the car and specifically state that I can't believe I'm being held hostage in a green SUV and loudly mention cross street corners the driver should stop at to let me out. This would give the operator enough info to dispatch police and the fake Uber driver would never know you're on the phone. But, none of this would happen to anyone if they'd just look at the Uber app and see that the car they're waiting for is still en route, so it can't possibly be the one sitting directly in front of you with a driver telling you in broken English, "Get in car. I take you home."
            </p>
            <p>
             They really need to hire better writers to create these bad after school special fake news stories that don't even offer any quality tactical advice on what you should do if you're stupid enough to find yourself in such a situation.

            Hi there
            <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/u/Premeditated123">
             @Premeditated123
            </a>
            . Thanks for sharing this important cautionary tale. Unfortunately, unless there is some connection to
            <em>
             child
            </em>
            trafficking by the global elite, we will have to remove this per Rule 1. We have an anything goes subverse called
            <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/v/pizzagatewhatever">
             v/pizzagatewhatever
            </a>
            for stuff that doesn't fit our submission rules. You could also repost it in
            <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/v/whatever">
             v/whatever
            </a>
            -- which is the most widely viewed subverse on Voat, so the maximum number of eyeballs would see it. I'll give this our 24 Hour Grace flair, in case someone can find a connection that would satisfy Rule 1 in that time, though. After that we'll have to remove it.
