<p>The next potential lead is Caterina\'s Club charity that is at the Anaheim White House. It is a restaurant that is modeled after the White House, located in Orange County. Every Christmas, they have a &quot;Pastathon&quot; which is a fundraising event. The owner Chef Bruno Serato feeds over 300 motel kids each day and has a cooking school for the kids. Motel kids are children who live with their families in poverty in local hotels.</p>
<p>Notice the heart logo on their homepage.  I\'m unsure if it counts as a double heart but there are two hearts...</p>
