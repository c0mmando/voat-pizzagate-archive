            This election drove me away from FB. Aside from the blatant censorship, it's how the handle privacy. I know - social media is never private, but you can't comment on a public page or news article without FB announcing it in your friend's timeline. I don't need the 80 yr old lady from the church click the alert that I've commented on a CNN article calling someone a useless uninformed douchebag. Or my ultra liberal SJW 20- something  co-worker taking that as an invite to engage me in debate.
           </p>
           <p>
            I even set up a fake account like people here suggested just so I could post George Webb links to news comment sections. FB didn't like that and flagged me. My acct is locked until I send them some form of identity - photo, SSN, drivers license - to verify I'm "real".
           </p>
           <p>
            Sorry, this isn't the place, but DAMN I hate facebook.

             Smart person ^. Based on what I saw during TwitterGate...Facebook / Instagram is one of the happiest hunting grounds for pedos who collect photos of children in normal every day settings. FB's photo crap is run in...(drum roll) MOROCCO...and there is literally a fortune to be made from selling photos of children. That ass Villardo (Open Secrets) served time for selling boy pics on eBay and a few other things. He's right back at it...
            </p>
            <p>
             ANY person who puts photos of their children on ANY social media is a fucking tard. That's all. Mommy's brag book literally turns into FapBook.

            I think it's an obvious effort to make the enemy camp appear larger than it actually is online. Multiple profiles on same site ect. You have to view it from the other side of "why would it inspire a response at all"? If it's so dumb and silly, why spend time writing the comments? And also, the comments are always an attack. If people actually were arguing against the merits with thoughtful posts than it would be different, but its immature post that just name call. Then again, a large portion of the left are just dumbed down morons who "think" they're intelligent.

            I think we should be wary of relating this to a queer thing.  Certainly James Alefantis is gay but many straight men will prefer young boys or girls because it's more of a dominance thing.  Watch this video where cops in Houston, during a period where boy prostitution was rampant, describes how the majority of perps are actually straight.

             Here's the thing. Gay people have struggled to climb out of the closet and end a few hundred years (gays have not always been..looked down upon..heh. Romans / Greeks and all that sort of thing). In some countries they are still hunted...but one does wonder how it is possible that any young boy used for sex (IE the dancing boys of Afghanistan) in MOSLIME countries would ever have a  hope of turning out hetero.
            </p>
            <p>
             However... what I see with many in the "gay" community now...and perhaps it's just the squeaky wheels...is the abject support for pedophilia.
            </p>
            <p>
             While I do not believe gay men are inherently pedos and I'm not painting with any brush, I do indeed recognize that many men in US who are "gay" are not gay from birth as many are, but gay from choice related to abuse and it is that segment that is abusing little boys.
            </p>
            <p>
             The rest of the pedos are straight men who are fucked in the head. Monsters are made and I personally know a few such persons. Here is a brief accounting of the heart rending  story of one of them....his mother used to smother him every night with a pillow until he "almost" stopped breathing. She also put him in bed with a mentally ill older male relative starting at age 3. The abuse was horrific in HINDSIGHT...but from the perspective of a 3 year old who was constantly being abused by his mother...he honestly thought what the relative was doing...was love. When he was 14 his mother kicked him to the streets...for being gay. I'm not kidding. He then became a prostitute to support himself.
            </p>
            <p>
             Needless to say this guy is a complete and total fucked up in the head gay man. IS he gay? Or is he merely acting on what he was taught from early childhood. (I do recognized born gay...sorry..but "gay" happens across the board in nature, it's just a crossed wire...and no one should ever suffer for who they love.)
            </p>
            <p>
             SO at one point this guy and his "partner" started inviting the partner's curious 7 year old into bed with them. This child is now an adult but when I knew him, he was hetero, dating girls......but guess what? He began sexually abusing the guy...seriously mentally/sexually abusing him...as revenge for what was done to him. I have no idea where he is now...or what shape he is in...but that was one twisted up kid.
            </p>
            <p>
             tl;dr many 'gay men' are not 'born gay' but conditioned gay from serious abuse. This is how monsters / pedos are born, how they perpetuate abuse that happened to them. You can see evidence of that in the movie Open Secrets.   Doing unto others what was done unto self...this is how it continues...at least in regards to this portion of the "gay" community. What I'd like to see happen is the gay community come out in force AGAINST pedophilia. I know another born gay couple raising the son of one of them (when he was trying to be straight and failing...he married..kid) and they are truly fabulous people / parents.
            </p>
            <p>
             That Khuns fellow is an example of a MADE monster...as is Alefantis. There is a difference and it needs to be said. The so called "gays" objecting to pizzagate are indeed monsters...as no right minded human being no matter where they like to give or take a dick..would EVER support the sexual / mental abuse of children.  I have zero explanation of straight men seeing a baby girl's vagina and thinking..."I'm gonna get me some of that" (and yes women abuse children too). I also know a few "lesbians" who suffered horrific childhood abuse to the point where it's difficult to asses whether it's truly a choice...or merely a rejection of the gender that abused them as children.
            </p>
            <p>
             We cannot stop pedofiles on the mezzo (Alefantis / Podesta) level unless we are willing to take a look at and speak up against what is happening in OUR HOMES on the mircro level. As above...so below. It's easy to march on PizzaGate...all the while keeping your mouth shut about what your creepy granpa or uncle or brother ..oh hell..what your creepy relatives are doing. Speak up, stand up...the only way to end pedophilia is to END it in our own homes.
            </p>
            <p>
             I would love to know how much child abuse is related to the perpetuation factor...how much came about BECAUSE gay men had to hide in the closet and the easiest targets to act out with were CHILDREN....who then went forth and perpetuated.

              I can tell you that when the full scope of pedo trafficking comes out we'll find it stems to the elite / politicians, but also to successful individual lawyers, businessmen and others not considered elite.  We'll find that it's these people that prefer boys because it's more exotic or might be due to a power pyschological thing but not due to their sexual orientation.  Watch this video and you will see.

               I agree...power is also a component. But remember..those who were abused the same way they are abusing, were powerless at one time as well. Power constructs are interesting...it's like...this. How is it possible that a people who know what it is to be starved, in turn starve others, a people who know what it is to be hated in turn hate...yada yada...as soon as they gain power...what do they do? Turn right around and do unto others what was done unto them...making others feel as powerless as they did. (Israel / Palestine)
              </p>
              <p>
               Obviously not every abuser was abused and the power construct in that situation is a low self-esteem person who gained money seeks to lower the self-esteem of others..there are many ways to destroy a child...that in turn seeks to destroy others.
              </p>
              <p>
               This is a many faceted issue. There's not just one cause. However, in general, I'd say the most violent abusers were likely abused....but you're right...power is a big part of it...same with rape.

              Something I have never understood is why people who are born gay and just want a regular life like everyone else, spend so much time defending the sicko's who choose to be gay monsters. Why don't they band together and speak up?

               I honestly don't know any "born gay" people who voted for Hillary. Most are like Milo...But we also must recognize that gay men in particular had it pretty rough up until what...the late 90s? Older gay men remember what it was like..how dark the closet really was...and I'm not 100% sure but I think there are still sodomy laws on the books in some states.
              </p>
              <p>
               I do know one that sent me an invite to the fucking women's march...LOL but...get this..he was the first openly gay and partnered man to run for and win a seat on city council in my uber conservative area...and I half wondered if politics wouldn't "turn" him...it did. He was a really super person, but now after four years he's turned to Snowflake central. Literally.
              </p>
              <p>
               Lesbian women have historically had it easier....women could live together as spinsters and no one said a thing..people might whisper but that's about it. Men on the other hand suffered a great deal if it became known they poked the pooper...hence many fake marriages and tragic families. That used to be a secret well worth keeping and many older gay men remember those days...so yes I can see them being afraid to speak out. Still we have fabulous Milo bravely setting an example and I hope the younger gay men that have never had to face the dangers of their elders will start stepping up and embracing that freedom. I literally know no one who cares who two consenting adults sleep with. I could not have said that 20 years ago.

             Being a video game buff all my life, this rings true. I would add, as enemie size and appearance go up a notch, you know you are approaching a mother ship like in Twin Cobra, as last desperate effort is made to save the ship.

Hi Ben. Tell me how an idiot such as yourself got a gig on a CBS affiliate in Atlanta spreading unsubstantiated rumors about some poor slob just trying to make a living selling pizzas. This seems to recall a piece you did recently regarding CNN's reporting on the unsubstantiated Trump dossier. So it's ok for you to spread blizzare unsubstantiated allegations and ruin lives but when CNN reports something true (they never implied that the dossier was factual and you know it) that has been known to news organizations and Washington insiders for months suddenly that's a fake news story. Do you realize how destructive you are? Do you realize what a small, unimpressive, low-life you are? Probably not. Well now you do. I don't think that my calling you out will change anything but I have told myself that whenever I see people like you doing the shit that you do I will no longer keep silent. One question though. How does someone like you live with himself? Sleep well Ben.

            Any man that is a feminist, needs his balls removed, and his man card taken away. That's worse than pretending you're black. The only reason a man would say he was a feminist, is to try to get laid.

             Sick to death of seeing masculinity frowned upon. Real men need to rise up and not apologize. Much better chance of getting laid that way anyways by a girl who actually shaves her pits and bathes more than once a week. Ever notice how much better looking conservative women are? They're the self confident, happy ones who demand a man be a man.

             Absolutely the case today that feminism is retarded.
            </p>
            <p>
             When feminism stood for equal rights long time ago it was ok.
            </p>
            <p>
             Right now feminists in the US are far more concerned with idiotic things they've invented outrage over like man-spreading rather than the plight of women in Islamic countries for instance.
            </p>
            <p>
             It's just about gaining power over weak men right now.

             There was a point in time where I would have argued with you against the point you're trying to make. However, given my exposure over the past few years to third wave feminism here in canada, and the absolute emasculation that it preaches, I'd prefer to give you a high five and a "Fuckin' Eh Buddy"

              You arent alone in that sentiment, fellow Canadian. Many of us have been disillusioned with feminism to the point that we are full-fledged enemies to that ideology now. The next election will raise some glaring issues with gender and race relations in Canada. The virtue signal generation is fucking over.

            I agree with you, Codewrought. Personally the only reason I really go on facebook is to speak with my elderly relatives. However I felt urged to commend him on a job well done. I should have expected the backlash.

             Facebook is in a bad state of affairs RT blocked from posting until after the inauguration, and shilling there is like a cancer. JTRIG spends most of its active social media budget on FB steering the narrative, makes CTR look like a bitch.

              I got off facebook three years ago and haven't looked back. I grew up and realized I didn't need constant "feedback" from others. Also...Zuckerberg....I absolutely refuse to give that man any way to make a penny off me. WE THE PEOPLE created that asshole monster...and based on what he's currently doing in Hawai'i and his collusion with Merkel...it is time to put him down.

              I'm not sure if it's CTR. I couldn't access most of the accounts because of privacy options. It could be entirely true that it's just people who have been drinking the kool-aid, or/and people who just refuse to believe something this monstrous could actually be happening under their noses and before their eyes.

               My own young adult son shut me down when I first brought it up. No way something this huge and horrendous could be covered up by so many people/news agencies/government offices/law enforcement. And yeah, at first glance that's a reasonable reaction. If you're never exposed to historic coverups, both proven or in theory, your brain just can't make that leap very easily. I get it, but it still pisses me off because I know what evil is out there infecting the world.
