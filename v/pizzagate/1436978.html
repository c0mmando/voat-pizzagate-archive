<p>&quot;Is It Propaganda Or Not?
Your Friendly Neighborhood Propaganda Identification Service, Since 2016!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;PropOrNot is an independent team of concerned American citizens with a wide range of backgrounds and expertise, including professional experience in computer science, statistics, public policy, and national security affairs. We are currently volunteering time and skills to identify propaganda - particularly Russian propaganda - targeting a U.S. audience. We collect public-record information connecting propaganda outlets to each other and their coordinators abroad, analyze what we find, act as a central repository and point of reference for related information, and organize efforts to oppose it.&quot;</p>
<p>-- Some of their advice:</p>
<p>&quot;Obtain news from actual reporters, who report to an editor and are professionally accountable for mistakes. We suggest NPR, the BBC, the New York Times, the Wall Street Journal, the Washington Post, Buzzfeed, VICE, etc, and especially your local papers and local TV news channels. Support them by subscribing, if you can!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Join us on Reddit, at <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/PropOrNot/">https://www.reddit.com/r/PropOrNot/</a>, to help us track down and expose Russian propaganda outlets that we haven\'t discovered yet.&quot;</p>
<p>-- And this group is calling for government investigations of &quot;Russian political interference&quot;:</p>
<p>&quot;We call on Congressional leadership, and the Obama administration, to:
Immediately begin investigations to determine whether any U.S. government action or inaction has allowed Russia to manipulate the US domestic political process, and interfere in the 2016 election, through online propaganda.</p>
<p>-- From the AP story:</p>
<p>&quot;NEW YORK (AP) -- A new report suggests a &quot;sophisticated&quot; Russian propaganda campaign helped flood social media with fake news stories leading up to the presidential election.</p>
<p>&quot;The Washington Post, citing a yet-to-be published report from independent researchers, said the goal was to punish Hillary Clinton, help Donald Trump, and undermine faith in American democracy.</p>
<p>&quot;The report comes from a nonpartisan group of researchers called PropOrNot. The group describes itself as &quot;concerned American citizens&quot; with expertise in computer science, national security and public policy. The researchers say they traced the origins of posts and mapped the connections among accounts that delivered similar messages.&quot;</p>
