            We need to steal the Mormon Churches DNA database and figure out who are the Rothschilds and all their puppet families bloodlines.  When we cross reference this grand list to our leaders we will have an idea who to remove and isolate quickly.

            You think these "low-level operatives" are going to see prison time?  You're going to accomplish this how -- by "outing": them?  It hasn't occurred to date.

             I think it could occur if people stop putting their head in the sand and acting like the stuff only happens in movies (eyes wide shut much?), wake up and refuse to let this stuff go unpunished. It's asking a lot, I know. In the meantime, we can still look into those low level people who get busted and see if it leads further up the chain.

            Let's get officials to cut those legs... oops, a problem: They are covering the legs. Otherwise a great idea.

            But no idea to rant (me) without trying to address the problem. How about... if we start with the

            </strong>
            . That should bite the legs, the hands and even the head, turning the well oiled pedo machinery into noisy, slow piece of junk, eventually loosing some covers and starting to
            <strong>
             leak.

             He means that the govt employee is not elite and therefore not part of PG. which is pure stupidity/shillery. Like I said, soros and Epstein aren't driving trucks filled with kids or harvesting organs themselves. The plebes are the hands and feet....
