            They really should differentiate between parents fleeing with their children and stranger abduction. Sometimes it's the only route a mother has to protect her kids from an abusive ex-husband or from CPS. Unless there was evidence that the mother was the abuser, I probably would never make a call and turn her in. And, yes, sometimes it is the mother that's the monster in the situation, but this doesn't sound like that.
           </p>
           <p>
            No NCMEC, one of your missing kids isn't home, they're stolen by CPS. I'd have to hear more about what the mother did or didn't do. All the training and help in the world sometimes isn't enough so there are cases where an intervention is needed, but this sounds suspicious.

             Yes, look at those children.  They look well cared for.  The pic of the little girl from before, she looks all scrubbed up and pretty.  Something is fishy alright.  I think she wanted to keep that girl safe no matter how.  Now I don't know what she will do.  Where have those other children been as well?

            It seems to me that there aren't enough amber alerts/missing kids on the news to match the statistics numbers and that the only missing kids you hear about are one taken by parents or other relatives (kid went willingly). I've only rarely seen a kid taken by strangers in the news.
           </p>
           <p>
            Are amber alerts are a terrorism tactic against parents?

             This is my feeling, exactly.  There are forces working against parents for sure.  I think there is a concerted effort being made now to take these children in any way they can.

            After leaving Court TV, Abrams was a general assignment correspondent for NBC News from 1997 to 1999 at which time he was named Chief Legal Correspondent.[6] Abrams then began hosting his own show at MSNBC, and The Abrams Report began in 2001.[7][8] Abrams hosted The Abrams Report until he accepted the lead managerial position at MSNBC.[9] Abrams held the position of General Manager of MSNBC from June 12, 2006 until October 2007.[10]With ratings up 62% during his tenure, Abrams left to concentrate on his 9pm show Live with Dan Abrams, which replaced Scarborough Country due to Joe Scarborough's move to mornings. This show would eventually be revamped and renamed Verdict with Dan Abrams,[11] which aired until August 21, 2008. MSNBC announced on August 19, 2008 that Air America Radio host Rachel Maddow would take over that 9 p.m. time slot beginning September 8, 2008.[12] At that time, Abrams took on additional duties with NBC News including substituting as an anchor on the Today show.

            Angeline Hartmann with the NCMEC said Amanda Martinez, the girl’s mother, disappeared with her three children when she was about to lose custody. Authorities later found the woman with her two other children.

            I looked into ICMEC that programs international counterpart which used Hillary Clinton to launch the program, I didn't have to look any further than the board to find red flags everywhere, I can only imagine what lies in the dark corners if NCMEC which has operated far longer.

             I just watched the video in that other article and that little girl looked well taken care of.  She was not dirty or filthy and neither were the other children.  I wonder if they took the other two.  Scares me.

             It's not just Texas, this is going on in many many states.  I now think that NCMEC and CPS may be working together, hand in hand.  Frightening for any parent and grandparent.
