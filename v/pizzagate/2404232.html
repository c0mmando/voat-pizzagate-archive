            , I'm a little late to this as I don't log in very often now, but let me react to this one. With all due respect, the fuck are you talking about?

             and MF pushed to have that changed. That should have been the tip off. "We know best" is bullshit.
            </p>
           </blockquote>
           <p>
            Never has the obligation for mods to explain their removals been lifted. The only thing that changed was
            <em>
             when
            </em>
            . The rule set you had created did not prove to be scalable or practicable, as explaining every single removal was both very taxing in terms of resources, with the sub often being under shill attack, and just nonsense, as we needed to keep rewording existing sub rules in 90% of the legit cases, as they were simply the results of people not reading the rules in the first place.
           </p>
           <p>
            We changed the rule about removal explanations so that they needed to be
            <em>
             requested
            </em>
            , in case the rule number cited in the removal note (which remained compulsory, by the way) wasn't sufficient as an explanation.
            <em>
             Every single time
            </em>
            when people actually asked for an explanation, we gave one. Contrary to your expectation, not a lot of people asked for one, it really only happened once in a great while.
           </p>
           <p>
            It's a bit ironic that you're preaching about bullshit in the same comment you're spreading bullshit in. If you don't remember the rule change clearly, feel free to read back. It's also ironic how you removed

             Unfortunately, Falcon stopped reading and responding to most modmail months ago, which is where the vast majority of such questions end up, because people reply to the removal message that Voat auto-sends. I was spending most of my time replying to modmail explaining his deletions trying to get people to fix their submissions and repost. The new 24 Hour Reprieve flair we are using now seems to be working much better; it gives everyone a chance to help submitters fix their threads so they satisfy the submission rules -- simultaneously preventing removals and educating everyone about how to follow the rules.

              Unfortunately, this is pretty irrelevant in terms of the original rule that clearly said that explanation requests should be posted as comments on deleted submissions, so that the explanation is visible to all other users on the sub to clear up any doubts in the community. It feels like both you and kev are attacking a straw man without regard to what that rule was about, and what it actually said.

             <p>
              I don't trust that the sub is in good hands right now, but time will tell.

            We already practically agree on everything and this conversation would have been over until you started trash talking like an ass so mind your manners and this could have been a polite discussion but you turned it shitty. I have done a ton to help you so don't question my fucking motives because you don't believe it and neither does the majority of people here and I promise you that it makes us question your motives when you talk like that because we heard that garbage from you owner types before. That big O by your name has no credibility anymore so just stop.

            Provide evidence or shut up and stop accusing me. A shill tried to bait me into defending a post this morning and disrupting the forum using Falcon as bait. I shut the shill down.

            Its ok. I will teach this to the forum slowly if I have to. it will slowly click to some of them that a title is one sentence in one hundred. It makes too much sense not to. At one point you mentioned that maybe all the rules should just be scrapped as a test which of course is not cool and I doubt you were serious but probably making a point that we needed
            <s>
             rules.
            </s>
            guidelines and we do. I like you but you are a guy that would actually down vote a post because of the title. Not everybody boils their toothbrush every morning before they use it like you do. This rule is causing tons of problems over one little tiny sentence our of potentially hundreds of relevant sentences. If the content of the post is not relevant, or shill material, great, get rid of the post. A "title" is not a post. Please let this sink in. I'm crensch this time, i'm right and you are wrong.

            In a perfect title world we would love perfect titles. Its not a perfect title world. Can't judge a book by its cover and can't judge a post by its title. If a shill post has a shill misleading title the content will reflect that.

             . I have to say that if this level of distracting stuff is going to come up whenever a title needs to be edited, it makes me want to remove Rule 3 problems from the 24 Hour Reprieve altogether and launch a community rule change discussion banning Link posts completely.

             Your opinion that titles are only 2% of the word count and therefore not important shows a complete lack of understanding of online communication. Shitty titles don't get clicks. They don't get shared, because they make the person sharing them look bad. They also don't show up appropriately in search results. Shitty titles are in fact a great way to keep research buried.

              If you want to delete posts because you think the title is "shitty" go ahead. I probably won't post here anymore anyway because of the title Nazis.

              No its not. Its like the cover on a book. Everybody won't meet your title standards but knock yourself out deleting their posts. I am sure they will appreciate it. I fought for this change to hopefully get some fresh air so I could post again. I think i'm done with you rule nazis and I have not decided but I might never post or comment here ever again. I am sick of you nit picking mother fuckers.

             This is a good example of what Falcon would call "Spamalek" and just delete for forum sliding and ban the OP to prevent point farming. We can do that. Alternatively, we could change the flair to "Possible Disinfo" and leave it up, as I proposed in

              When we let it stay, we need to keep flairing it 'Edit Warning', since OP hasn't provided a summary as requested in Rule 3.
             </p>
             <p>
              Maybe it's good to let it stay, as suggested by you, so everybody can see it and see the 'Disinfo' flair.
             </p>
             <p>
              However, it was my understanding that we can't flair posts with more than one flair at a time?

               LOL. True. Only one flair. In this case, maybe leave the Edit flair and then switch or Disinfo or Remove. I'm curious what others' opinions are.

                I'd suggest to switch to 'Disinfo' after 24 hours, then delete it.
               </p>
               <p>
                This way it will have the 'Disinfo' flair in the 'removed submissions' log.

                    do we really want things we clearly have labeled as 'disinfo' to stay up permanently?

                    forgive my lack of knowledge, but is there a way we could organize all the 'disinfo' posts in a separate sub so that we wouldn't have to delete them?  this would allow the post to show up in the user's submissions profile (and allowing researchers to continue to review them if they wish) without cluttering the main sub with known disinfo.

                     tracking the disinfo and include archives of the threads in question, as well as a list of usernames, there. That won't make it show up in the users Submission history, though.

             Gothamgirl like you I understand that the video is painting a broad vague picture of related events, and like you "i get it" but in my opinion it might be cool to watch but not post worthy.

             Hey Gothamgirl, if you understand it, could you take a stab at explaining it? The OP has not bothered to do so, or to make an effort at honoring the submission rules. This is exactly what MF would consider a disinfo post meant to waste everyone's time and slide real content off of the board.

              while i don't necessarily agree with MF that it a 'disinfo post,' i would say that this particular video, even granting that it may hold some deeper meaning related to pg, does not belong on this sub (perfect for

             <p>
              too weird and spazzy.  incomprehensible to the vast majority of people that watch it and imo gives this sub a poor image to any normies who may stumble upon it.  we have enough cryptic puzzles and esoteric symbology to decipher in this investigation...we certainly don't need to add to the perplexity.

               This is the key to these type of posts, IMO. They make no attempt to posit a thesis that can be proven or disproven (because they don't want you to engage critically). They offer no corroboration of supporting claims in the form of evidence that can be verified. They rely far too heavily on innuendo forcing the viewer/reader to "fill in the blanks" and see what they want to see (Confirmation Bias). All of this distracts from legitimate research posts that attempt to actually nail stuff down. It's for exactly this reason that we have the rules we have.

                I just think some of these 'truthers', who in most cases have the best of intentions, should stay off the drugs. If that's how your going to express yourself, fuck off, I dont need your bizarre, triggering bullshit. There are much better ways to get the point across. 4Chan kek fuckin' weirdos.

                 Well its not drugs lol,  its a puzzle, you can't understand one piece without the others. I honestly think they do this to make you work hard to figure it out.  In other words they're not giving away free answers, just small bits. Same thing as Q in a different way.

               What I posted was spam in your opinion, not in my view. Sorry your fucking majesty, you nasty bitch. Forget that we're fighting the same fight?

            Cicada 3301 always smelled like a trap. A way to catch and subvert anyone that may be smart enough or otherwise disposed ro expose their evil plot...bwahahahaha. Also, it was really hard to solve those puzzles.

               will have to take it down himself and repost it with a better headline within 24 hours for the 24 hour flair to make sense. But flairing it and giving it the grace period clearly has positive advantages anyway:
              </p>
              <ul>
               <li>
                It puts control in the OP's hands
               </li>
               <li>
                It reinforces the new spirit of collaboration as demonstrated by
                <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/user/carmencita">
                 @carmencita
                </a>
                's comment
               </li>
               <li>
                And it creates an opportunity to engage the whole community in suggesting better headlines
               </li>
              </ul>
              <p>
               We just need to explicitly ask the OP to Edit the title by Self-Removing and reposting within 24 hours. Thoughts?
