            <p>
             Most experts agree that the first blog was Links.net, created in 1994 by then-student Justin Hall as a place to publish his writing. The site consisted entirely of brief posts, each one sharing a link and some of his thoughts on the content within. This compilation of links included links to websites he liked, as well as his own work.
            </p>
            <p>
             Others quickly followed in Hall’s footsteps, creating their own sites to share their personal lives and thoughts. With the term “blog” not invented yet, these sites were referred to as “Online Diaries” or even “Personal Pages”.
             <strong>
              In 1997, the term “weblog” was coined by Jorn Barger of the influential Robot Wisdom blog to describe these sites.

            <p>
             Some boylovers have found blogs to be the perfect environment to express ideas, concerns and questions concerning today's society. Many blogs allow feedback by visitors, known as comments, which often sparks debates among users.
            </p>
            <p>
             A blog sometimes gives boylovers a way to spread thoughts and ideas without the need to reveal the real identity, but many hosting companies will refuse to host openly boylover blogs, an specialist free speech hosts can be necessary to guarantee that webhosting companies do not bow to outside pressure, some people have hosted in free platforms like BlogSpot.com or WordPress.com, any boylover blogging should at the very least get their own domain name so that if the site is taken down the domain will remain on their hands and can be redirected to a new host, they should also make website back ups often to avoid losing hours of work.

             Jorn Barger (/ˈbɑːrɡər/; born 1953) is an American blogger, best known as editor of Robot Wisdom, an influential early weblog. Barger coined the term weblog to describe the process of "logging the web" as he surfed. He has also written extensively on James Joyce and artificial intelligence, among other subjects; his writing is almost entirely self-published.

             In high school Barger specialized in math and science, but also read Sigmund Freud, James Joyce, and Jiddu Krishnamurti. He graduated a year early, as co-valedictorian from Maple Grove Jr.-Sr. High School in Bemus Point,[5][6] then attended Jamestown Community College, Antioch College, New College of Florida and University at Buffalo without taking a degree.[2] In 1973 he decided against a career in computing and "worked on self-discovery" instead for the next six years.[7] During this period, in 1978, he lived for six months at

             The Farm is an intentional community in Lewis County, Tennessee, near the town of Summertown, Tennessee,[2] based on principles of nonviolence and respect for the Earth. It was founded in 1971 by Stephen Gaskin, and 300 spiritual seekers from Haight-Ashbury and San Francisco. The Farm was the setting for "the rebirth of midwifery in the United States" and the creation of "the modern home-birth movement."[3] Its members have founded a number of nonprofit organizations, including Plenty International, a relief and development organization, and Swan Conservation Trust, who established the 1,358 acres (550 ha) Big Swan Headwaters Preserve.[4] The Farm has approximately 200 members and residents..

              He said it processes any level of information.  That didn't sound right to me so I looked it up.
             </p>

              <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SIPRNet">

             <p>
              SIPRNET processes up to secret.  He said it processes any level (including top secret) which is not true.  Hard to believe anything he says after that.
