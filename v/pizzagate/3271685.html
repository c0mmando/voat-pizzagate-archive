<p>There are a number of points which are relevant but I want to focus on the business relationship between Peter Max and Park West :</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Park West is still aggressively selling Peter Max aboard the world’s cruise ships. Just before Christmas, the gallery had some of the best real estate on the Mariner of the Seas, a Royal Caribbean ship drifting through the mint-blue waters off Coco Cay in the Bahamas. With Max pieces front and center, Park West had set up in a narrow corridor between the main dining room and the restrooms, which made it hard for anyone who went to dinner and had to use the toilet to avoid a Park West salesperson.</p>
<p>He compared Mr. Max to Warhol and conceptual artists like Jeff Koons and Damien Hirst, who exert creative control but typically rely on others to paint or construct the art. ..</p>

<p><strong>Park West Gallery</strong> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Park_West_Gallery">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Park_West_Gallery</a> </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Park West Gallery is a commercial art gallery founded in 1969 by <strong>Albert Scaglione and based in Southfield, Michigan, United States</strong>, where it occupies 63,000-square-foot (5,900 m2) premises, which is open for public and educational visits. It employs 1,000 staff globally and stated its annual revenue as $300–$400 million (2007 figure). It exhibits historic artists such as Renoir as well as contemporary artists. It funds the philanthropic Park West Foundation.[1][2]</p>
<p>In 1993, Park West Gallery began staging art auctions on cruise ships around the world. The company currently operates on over 100 ships and conducts more than 5,000 auctions per year on board, as well as in Ritz Carlton hotels and other luxury properties.</p>
<p>..Park West Gallery established its Park West Foundation in 2006, a non-profit that assists young men and women who are exiting the foster care system. As of 2013, the foundation has assisted more than 350 individuals with housing, transportation, jobs and clothing. It also provides tuition assistance for post-secondary education through partnerships with universities. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Since its founding in 2006, Park West Foundation has partnered with the Michigan Department of Human Services and other agencies to provide counseling, education and support for foster youth and those aging out of the system. The foundation was founded by Park West Gallery Founder and CEO Albert Scaglione and his wife, Mitsie, who serves as the foundation’s executive director. </p>

<p>Yep, and here is an interesting article I just dug up about <strong>human trafficking in Michigan</strong>. Why did I dig this up?</p>
<p>When I heard about Centurion Aviation above, it connected a few dots for me... Devos also created (and runs with an iron fist) a massive annual art event here in Grand Rapids called ArtPrize that is a well-known hot spot for sex trafficking each year; so much so that groups warn females not to go to the massive event alone...</p>
<p>Basically, underage teens are enticed or sometimes forced to become prostitutes during the event, many are used by high-profile \'clients\' that are in town for the event, and I have seen many times quite young looking women dressed provocatively entering the Devos property. Not children, but teens/college girls. I used to live with a friend right down the road from one of Devos\' homes.</p>

            Basically, underage teens are enticed or sometimes forced to become prostitutes during the event, many are used by high-profile 'clients' that are in town for the event, and I have seen many times quite young looking women dressed provocatively entering the Devos property. Not children, but teens/college girls. I used to live with a friend right down the road from one of Devos' homes.

              The flights which linked the global secret detention system were ostensibly made by private, civilian aircraft, with the US Government's hand hidden behind a layer of private businesses. However, investigations during 2004 and 2005 - noticeably by the Washington Post and The New York Times - blew the cover on a set of companies which appeared to exist only on paper, and which acted as a front for CIA activity to go unnoticed. These 'shell companies' hid between 25-30 aircraft owned by the CIA, some of which were heavily involved in the renditions programme....

             Aircraft operators are companies which maintain private aircraft on behalf of their owners, and may also provide them for customers who want to charter an aircraft, either on a one-off basis or under a rolling contract. These companies exist on the ground (unlike shell companies), although some such as Aerocontractors and Tepper Aviation may for all intents and purposes run by the CIA.

              ...But looks are deceiving, because Jedco is one of the region’s most successful aerospace suppliers, with its main manufacturing space comprised of 71,000 square feet — virtually an underground factory — on Richmond near Broadway. About 170 employees produce high-tech jet engine parts for military and commercial aviation, work that generates about $25 million in annual sales for the privately held company, which is growing.
             </p>
             <p>
              ..Jedco’s No. 1 customer is Pratt &amp; Whitney, one of the world’s best-known companies in development and production of aircraft engines, rocket engines and industrial gas turbines.
              <strong>
               In May, Pratt &amp; Whitney, which has been a Jedco customer since the mid-1980s, was awarded a $1.13 billion contract from the Department of Defense to produce engines for the F-35 Lightning II jet fighter.

             New Jersey Health Care CEO Charged in $200 Million Fraud
            </a>
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             Parmar, 48, of Colts Neck, is charged with securities fraud and conspiracy. Part of the alleged scheme involved purchases of nonexistent entities and then funneling those millions into separate accounts, prosecutors said.
            </p>
            <p>
             The FBI said in addition to creating sham acquisitions, Parmjit also helped oversee the falsification of bank records, list phony customers and misrepresent earnings to investors. One fake company was called “MDRX Billing,” an Ohio-based company prosecutors said never existed and alone was a $28 million dollar rip-off.
            </p>
            <p>
             Two financial officers – Sotirios “Sam” Zaharis, 51 of Weehawken and Ravi Chivukula, 44 of Freehold, were also charged. They are believed to be overseas in India and could not be reached for comment. An attorney for Parmar -- who is expected to appear in Newark federal court Wednesday afternoon -- could not immediately be reached.

             Wyclef Jean Paid His Mistress $105,000 Through His Haiti Charity
            </a>
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             Yele Haiti, the sketchy foundation that Wyclef Jean founded to help the Haitian people—which received millions in the outpouring of generosity following the wake of the earthquake there—paid Jean's mistress and personal assistant $105,000 in 2008.
            </p>
            <p>
             That's
             <strong>
              Zakiya Khatou-Chevassus
             </strong>
             on the right in the photo above. According to Yele Haiti's 2008 tax return, which was posted this week by the Smoking Gun, the charity paid Khatou-Chevassus $105,000 as an independent contractor in 2008 for "program development." That amounts to roughly one-third of all the money Yele spent that year on management and general expenses.
            </p>
            <p>
             So what did she do for that money? Khatou-Chevassus is currently listed on Yele's web site as the organization's vice president. But according to five sources familiar with Yele's operations, in 2008 she served as Jean's personal assistant—working on his commercial endeavors as well as his charitable ones—and was involved romantically with the former Fugees star.
            </p>
            <p>
             ..Jean has a long history of using Yele Haiti's money for his own commercial gain. In 2005, 2006, and 2007, the foundation paid out a total of $410,000 to commercial entities controlled in whole or in part by Wyclef, including a whopping $250,000 for advertising time on a Haitian television station he co-owns. According to internal financial statements obtained by Gawker in January, Jean didn't contribute a single dollar to Yele Haiti's American operation during the year he founded it, and its founding executive director resigned because he "saw hundreds of thousands of dollars going to business needs and nothing going to the charity, when it seemed that part of Wyclef's new PR strategy focuses on his charitable endeavors." In 2006, he demanded a $100,000 fee to perform at a Yele Haiti fundraiser designed to raise money for his own hometown. The event was canceled in part because securing Jean's participation was too expensive.
            </p>
            <p>
             ..As the Smoking Gun noted, Khatou-Chevassus seems to have done some modeling in the past. The photo on the right above was taken at a 2009 reception she organized in New York for Prince Edward's International Award Association. (Captions from photographs taken at the event that we found online identify her as the CEO of Carte Blanche International, but we're almost certain that's an error. All of the people we spoke to who know Khatou-Chevassus say it's preposterous that she'd be a credit card executive; we've called Carte Blanche to ask.)
            </p>
            <p>
             A call to Khatou-Chevassus and an e-mail to Yele Haiti's publicist were not immediately returned.

              One way to handle this tenuous, maybe-related-but-it's-not-clear stuff is to add them as comments with that caveat and a call for further research. Another good habit it to make sure you clearly state the thesis of the submission and how each element of it supports it (rather than dumping a string of different things whose relationship isn't spelled out or stated clearly). :-)

               I hear you :-)  I've included this comment in the post to hopefully substantiate the inclusion of Michigan posts

               I've taken out one of those Michigan posts as well.. hopefully this makes the post a little clearer.

             The Park West Foundation which is the foundation end of Park West which handles Peter Max's art is partnered with Michigan Department of Health.  So I included pizzagate posts which are Michigan related.  Much of the background to the couple is in Blacksmith21's post, the link I provided at the top of the post.  I can include a summary of the relevant points from that post to show why I thought this post is appropriate for this subverse.

             The 'pieces of the puzzle' comment was more about the accumulative info we have as a collective on Voat, not referring to this sole post.  I've removed the sentence as it may be confusing.

              Ah. Okay...I see now. So what would help, then, is a thesis that the rot in Michigan is starting to become visible, state that here's everything we've got on Michigan, and call for research to see if people can find any links between them. It just needs to be clear and not left in the realm of implication and innuendo.
