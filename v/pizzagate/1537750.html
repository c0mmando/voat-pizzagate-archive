<p>Is this her biological daughter? Comparing the two, it does not appear so. Would have had the child a the age of ~41, and no evidence of a spouse. Of course, this is purely speculation. As we know by know, it is common for these child predators to acquire victims through adoption.</p>

<p>Lastly, not sure if this is relevant but when searching her name on Google this photo keeps coming up from someone called Alexandra Javier on Pinterest, not sure if it\'s the same person or if not who this person is, but it is pretty creepy and keeps coming up in my searches for Alexandra Migoya. If you check out the Pinterest she has a whole section on unsettling children and toddlers wearing cutsie outfits like this.</p>

<p>This will show near the top of the first page of Google Images when searching \'Alexandra Migoya\'... It seems to be now associated with a Pinterest user named Angela-Krista Kandes. Due to the sensitive nature, I am not willing to follow this any further. Maybe one of you can.</p>

            the really big deal about the corocran is that they went out of business and had to donate all their art and buildings to GWU and the National Gallery of Art.
           </p>
           <p>
            no big deal, just a couple billion in assets.  i'm sure they won't be missed.
           </p>
           <p>
            anyway, Andrew (Jon) Kline is involved, he's the registrar for the corporation which is the shell registrar for the trustees of the corcoran.  if that doesn't ring a bell, he's also the registrar for the shell company which owns the lot for besta pizza.
           </p>

            interesting that the dc based 'occasions catering' has two branches...and the virginia branch is registered as a foreign company.
