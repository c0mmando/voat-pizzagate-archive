<p>All of this does not mean arrests will start tomorrow, but one thing is for certain - our President has set the stage for 1000\'s of detainees all of who likely appear in the sealed indictments.</p>
<p>It is worth explaining how all of this came to fruition.  The video covers all of it, as well as additional links provided below.</p>
<p>The NSC (National Security Council) is the principal forum used by a president for consideration of national security and foreign policy matters.   President Trump\'s power was directly threatened the end of February when it was revealed that the Deep State had created its own NSC, calling it National Security Action.  It is being led by Bob Rhodes, who was former Deputy National Security Adviser for Obama. Rhodes expressed his contempt of a free press by voicing his disgust of the entire US media establishment by stating:</p>
<p>&quot;Most of the outlets are reporting on world events from Washington.  The average reporter we talk to is 27 years old, and their only reporting experience consists of being around political campaigns.  That\'s a sea change.  They literally know nothing.&quot;</p>
<p>With his brother, David Rhodes (President of CBS News), Ben Rhodes is protected by the Deep State\'s mainstream propaganda media sychophants who are failing to tell us that these coup plotters are in the process of establishing their own &quot;Shadow Cabinet&quot; to usurp Trump\'s power.  
</p>
<p>President Trump, however, had at his disposal the US law called The Military Justice Act of 2016 which authorizes the most significant changes to The Uniform Code of Military Justice ever since The Military Justice Act of 1983 (the one that Obama never enacted into law) NOR did Trump who missed a 12/23/17 signing deadline to do so!  But wait, this gets much better.</p>
<p>So, since the Deep State began the creation of an actual &quot;shadow government&quot; by creating their own NSC, Trump, on 03/01/18, signed the  Executive Order.  For him to sign this Order, the logical explanation for doing so was this rise of dissidents entering into the courts\' martial process in the 1000\'s, if not tens of 1,000\'s.  
</p>
<p>Pentagon sources explained that &quot;President Trump signed Executive Order 3/1 to amend the Court-Martial Manual to get civilian legal help and prepare the public for Nuremberg II military tribunals of the cabal before truth and reconciliation.  Also, according to Pentagon sources, the essence of these Orders was that all US civilians shall be subject to military justice and that the military will be able to hire non-military legal experts to help with the upcoming tribunals.

            Did my title piss-off most of you?  Must have because it couldn't be the text discussion because I don't own it.
           </p>
           <p>
            To all of you who are going ballistic on here, just pretend the title reads as follows...you have 2 choices:
           </p>
           <ol>
            <li>
             <p>
              Has the Path Been Cleared for the Arrests of Deep State Pedophiles?
             </p>
            </li>
            <li>
             <p>
              Will the Path Ever Be Reached for the Arrests of Deep State Pedophiles?
             </p>
            </li>
           </ol>
           <p>
            Is this not the main issue?
           </p>
           <p>
            How 'bout all of you who are in the boxing ring answer one of those questions with a "Yes"  or a "No?"  Easy enough, right?
           </p>
           <p>
            Here's where you may, however, have some difficulty.  After answering "Yes" or "No," provide a short paragraph addressing the reason for your answer.

             Plenty of people all over the web are organizing and planning on how to make changes.  You think voat is the only legit place people are talking?  The amount of people redpilled today,  aware of pizzagate,  Qanon etc are now in the millions.  Looking at the youtube subscribers proves this.

             Exactly.. this is what we need ti realise.. he met with Kissinger in person in secret..  Kissinger is one of the most vile pieces of shit on this earth by far. 
And yes Trump made a HUGE arms deal with the Saudis last year.. the biggest is history!
Can we truth this guy.. no friggin way. 
However during 911 he did say it looked like a controlled demolition.. obviously no one had given him the script.. he was out of the loop on that one.. for sure there are different factions in these elite circles.. its a fucking mess of corruption and bullshit.. and I wish we could just send them all off to another planet somewhere so they can play out their pathetic ego games and money addictions without affecting people who just want to live a peaceful free life and "do no harm".
i wish we could just live on our own planet in harmony with nature without money or ownership or any need to buy land.. which is the biggest con ever.. and everyone was entitled to their own piece of land to build a home and grow food and live. This place sucks.

              Trump and other white hats are inevitably going to be speaking with the deep state from time to time.  They are even going to appear at times to be working together. This is the game.  Its complex and confusing.  Get used to it.

              Agree, agree, agree, that this place sucks.  We moved to a rural area 6 years ago populated with Amish farms.  I have learned much from these people and have become friends with a few families and provide transportation for them once or twice a week.  Not accepting money for my services, we barter.  My visits to malls, shopping centers, the city, and busy highways are at the bare minimum.
             </p>
             <p>
              We can't go on like this, that is certain.  I do not see a good ending but am a believer that a better world will be created.

              Is that your only excuse not to listen? That they're a new member? I made a post about Trump being a psyop 8 MONTHS AGO. Is that long enough ago to pass your bias?

             <p>
              I swear, is this board not actually dedicated to making change? As soon as someone questions your narrative, you flip. Are you expecting to be right 100% of the time? Are you going to argue until you're blue in the face, no matter how wrong you are, and no matter how far off the tracks it puts us? For fucks sake. What is so bad about taking your Trump-colored glasses and considering another possibility for a minute? You're so brainwashed and you don't even see it.

               When people get all riled up with hope for something, they get upset when somebody challenges that and suggests an alternative.

               . I want to see the New World Order crumble to the ground, probably even more than you or anybody on this sub. That's why, if we're being led on by a psyop (which my research leads me to believe), we need to drop it ASAP, unify under some sort of singular ideology, and devise a plan of action to expose these crimes on a massive scale together.  To think I've only been a user here for with this account a few weeks is ridiculous.

               However, I feel like I'm trying to talk you out of being with an Ex-GF who cheats on you and lies to you or some shit, yet you remain faithful to her. Not everybody here is going to take the bait of "Our POTUS is a good guy, trust us. He's taking down the elites, here's an unverifiable anon who will assure you along the way. Stay docile, we'll take care of everything". There are layers of deception to this that you may be unaware of. All I'm trying to do is to get you to question your devotion to this conservative-Trump trojan horse ideology.

                Ya know, my feeliings about our President and every single politician in this country are up for grabs.  I have no devotion to any of them and believe it is fair to say little to no respect as well.  It is safe to say that devotion is reserved for God Almighty, my husband, my family, and my best friend. I am just waiting, as we all are, for a shake-up from someone, somebody.  The consequences will certainly be many, but that is how we will make things right again.

            The Trump vs Deep state psyop sub continues it's nonsense. Arrest are not imminent, Trump is one of them. The entire system is controlledand does not arrest itself. This sub religously sells the lie. That must be it's purpose.

             No odds. He's obviously out to make a name for himself in the history books, I doubt he wants to be remembered as the 1-year president who sent a couple thousand 'free-thinkers' (whatever that means) to Gitmo. He's either going after drugs dealers or pedos, and I'm putting my money on the latter.

              That's a good point. For all we know, the sealed indictments could be for all the real patriots trying to stop the deep state and pizzaphiles. I still think trump is /ourguy/ and the indictments are for rounding up the cabal. Material law makes me nervous though.

               There's somethin' happenin' here
What it is ain't exactly clear

Tellin' me I got to beware

               There's battle lines bein' drawn
Nobody's right if everybody's wrong
Young people speakin' their minds
Gettin' so much resistance from behind

               What a field day for the heat
A thousand people in the street
Singin' songs and carryin' signs
Mostly sayin', "hooray for our side"

               Paranoia strikes deep
Into your life it will creep
It starts when you're always afraid
Step out of line, the man come and take you away
              </p>
              <p>
               (We better)
Stop, hey, what's that sound?
Everybody look - what's goin' down?
(We better)
Stop, hey, what's that sound?
Everybody look - what's goin' down?
(We better)
Stop, now, what's that sound?
Everybody look - what's goin' down?
(We better)
Stop, children, what's that sound?
Everybody look - what's goin' down?

            13Buddha, these sources are pretty sketchy. Not just Zublic, the broken CBTS_Stream link (maybe find an archive of the original page?) but also yournewswire. Anything they print is likely to be disinfo written to make conservatives look like idiots when they believe it and spread it, making anyone who hosts it look like disinfo as well.

             , I have edited, added, and omitted the reddit link.  There is limited information thus far about the 03/01 Executive Order.  For sure, MSM hasn't covered it.
            </p>
            <p>
             Does everybody on here want Trump out of office?  This Executive Order could be put to good use, but there is no crystal ball.  There's still hope, right?  Maybe nothing will happen, but the negativity here is brutal, and  several new users are intolerable.  I  can take anything that is thrown at me but am getting to the point of why waste my time researching and posting?  What a shame, because I am passionate about this sub, but IMO, it is being ruined by rudeness and ignorance.  It only takes a few people to screw-up a good thing.

              The way the shills hit this thread of yours, 13B, I'd say there is a LOT of hope. :-)  But sites like yournewswire and beforeitsnews are designed to create false hope that is then easily popped like a soap bubble.

              That is what they are counting on. We are in a war, 13B, against people who rape kids on video for money and leverage, piss away the lives of soldiers to cause mass migrations, abort babies to make new flavors of soft drink. If ignorance, rudeness, and negativity from concern trolls are going to hurt your resolve such that you have to grasp at fake news sites to get your balance, this may not be the right place in the battle line for you. That's okay. Strategic retreat is a legit necessity at times. On the other hand...

             <p>
              Where there is ignorance, inform. Eclipse rudeness with good will. Let negativity resolve you to always be ready to give evidence for the hope that you have. That's what I try to do. :-)

             Exactly what ive been thinking.. and what many are commenting on here.. the idea that we are been played BIG TIME!!
This whole QAnon thing stinks to high heaven if you ask me.. I feel like he is just another Drake, another COBRA, another planted bullshit artist with the purpose of making us feel like things are under control so we will as usual sit on our collective asses and do sweet fuck all to free ourselves. This is what ive been saying here since Voat started!
This needs to be discussed.. What are our options IF this is true.. IF we are been played in this way?
I think we can answer this with a simple question: What are They afraid of more than anything?
Answer: An organised uprising of citizens who oppose the current Governance of America. Who no longer want to be governed by criminals. This is what they fear the most, hence taking away our guns.. hence increasing encroaching on freedoms.. hence this militarisation of civilian trials for crissake!! And some people bless their trusting souls.. are trying to paint this in a positive light with some pretty big assumptions not built on much.
SItes like neonnettle and yournewswire are full of bullshit.. literally.. and are part of this game for sure.. its been their MO (modus operandi)
Ive posited this question before.. what can we do about all this? A real and actual revolution of some kind?
AN uprising,.. ive suggested this before and been met with mixed responses.. but a real uprising IS EXACTLY what "they" fear the most from the citizens.. we know this by what they do.. This is a HUGE hint if you ask me.. 
Im sure there are good men in positions of power.. but are they effective at all really? Are they organised? The satanic network has people planted everywhere.. So many in this group are counting on and waiting for some kind of good guys to "save the day" at some point while we compile and research and spend hours collecting data and info.. but we don't even know if there really is anyone with the real and actual power to do anything with it..
Think about it.. put yourself in an elite position.. many have died trying to help.. many journalists, researchers, politicians even.. anyone who opposes the satanic cabal gets taken down.. they are a well oiled machine.. there is in-fighting, they make mistakes.. they screw up.. BUT they are ruthless, will stop at nothing.. and we are more or less kind and hopeful..
Can WE, yes US, not some maybe white hats maybe good guys somewhere, can we rise up in huge numbers and do something to stop this madness? If you ask me... only through education of the masses.. somehow.. through grass roots .. but most citizens are too busy surviving to be educated.. BUT there are many patriots.. millions even.. a mass protest perhaps..  worldwide media attention?
Im just bringing to the table some other ideas because I feel we need more ideas then just researching and compiling data and waiting and hoping.. dont we?

             Hilarious how these people don't see that Trump IS pizzagate. He's an elite with multiple sexual assault claims, some against minors. But they ignore that because it doesn't work for their narrative. Its seriously pathetic, and it's exactly why this is going nowhere until people wake the fuck up. We shouldn't be praising him, we should be fighting against him.

              Precisely. But, thats the whole point of the shills taking over this sub. It's a limited hangout to cheerlead for Trump and merge the conspiracy culture with partisan-right politics.

               I don't think any elite pedos will be arrested ever at least not in public that would open up a huge can of worms and Trump himself will be implicated he went to sex parties with Jeffrey Epstein  in New York and probably on Epstein Island where they raped very young girls and there is probably video of Trump doing this.

             well i know for sure yournewswire is a propaganda piece for brainwashing on all kinds of BS.. thats a fact. They also make up viral stories like for example the queen shapeshifting in public and also Adele shapeshifting during a performance.. not that shapeshifting isnt possible.. it was just obvious those stories were made up by the way it was written.. 
And this quote from your newswire about the executive order.. Talk about stretching the truth! geeeez!!!

             To be frank and honest, I could not find a source directly from the Pentagon.  The non-Pentagon sources found, used quotes for Pentagon responses/replies but provided no source.  Is it all BS? I have no way of determining that.  Do any of us really know what is real anymore except for the evil that we have discovered and revealed?

              I'm not saying Trump is pulling a fascist coup.  I'm saying these secret arrests and people being sent to Guantanamo are not happening. I'm saying that they are completely imaginary because if they were occurring it would be an illegal coup.  An illegal coup that is not happening.
             </p>
             <p>
              The US is still not a banana republic.  We don't secretly disappear people.  You can't simply be arrested and held without charges or without you having access to a lawyer.
             </p>
             <p>
              Habeas corpus has not been suspended.  Habeas Corpus is such a fundamental right, it's in the body of the Constitution, it didn't need to wait for the bill of rights.
             </p>
             <p>
              It's also illegal for the US military to be involved in domestic law enforcement.  This actually used to be a core issue of the paranoid right in the US.
             </p>
             <p>
              Martial law wasn't declared and we all somehow missed it.  We're not in some alternate universe.
             </p>
             <p>
              Now, to your comments.
             </p>
             <p>
              Who are these likely targets? What's the evidence against them?
             </p>
             <p>
              There have been no illegally obtained FISA warrants.  This is fantasy.  And crush Trump's campaign?  The existence of the FISA warrants were NOT revealed until after election.  The first FISA warrant was on Carter Page and it was granted in OCT 2016 almost a month AFTER Page left the Trump campaign.  Also Carter Page was working with the Russians and that FISA warrant was renewed several times by different people and different judges.
             </p>
             <p>
              Also I just tried to watch the video to see what executive order he was speaking about and my goodness, what a bunch of nonsense.  This should get the possible disinformation flair.
             </p>
             <p>
              Executive Orders are public documents.  Before entertaining this idiot on video, show me the executive order that says this.

               A coup? The "government" was abolished in 1933 via the banking act. We are a corporation owned by the banking cartel. Rothschilds have interest in FED and IRS through the Bank of England, which they own. You guys are doing phoney left vs right speculation. The courts are also phony. They rely on you using your corporation title, because they have no judicial authority. It's a game. the info is all out there. Wake up or stay ignorant. You are doing your job however, so this does not apply to you, but for others reading it.

            Sorry to break it to you guys but TRUMP IS A DEEPSTATE CRYPTO-KIKE. He is friends with Epstein. He was friends with the Clintons. He has pizzadust on his fingers. He allows too many kikes to orbit and influence him. His "non-establishment" sing-song game is just a ruse to placate the goyim.

            Here is a question. Why would just use civilian courts? Why do all of this non-sense just to be able to "court-martial" civilians (which doesn't even really make sense). Will martial law be declared?

               No. But the constant "kike kike kike" sounds shilly! I know the so called Jews are bad news and a part of the problem, but those who resort to using kike get hung up on blaming everything on every Jew who ever existed, which takes away from the problem as well

                We need to begin dehumanizing our enemy. That way when the day of extermination comes we won't be stopped by emotions like remorse and empathy.

                Yes, ALL Jews ARE the problem. It (and its 2 sequels) is a religion that is centered around raping children. All adherents to it will have to be removed from this world if you want to prevent children from being raped.

              wait do you really think it is a pedophilia-based cult?  surely you mean the legal profession in general is packed with JEWS?  I mean, the moment we got FOUR on the supreme court we got nationwide gay marriage.  are you capable of drawing any conclusions whatsoever.
             </p>
             <p>
              that poster is clearly a more logical thinker than you:
             </p>
             <p>
              1) trumps admin is like half jewish.  all his kids married jews.  his business partners have been jews.
              <br/>
              2) no jew has ever sold out his own kind (no not even Benjamin freedman).
             </p>
             <p>
              ergo at a minimum trump will not bite the hand that has always fed him and at most he is a cult member.

                  Do I really need to point out all of the times this board has been in a frenzy with ITS HAPPENING posts, only to be let down every time? Remember the swordfish LARP? Remember all of the (((George Webb)))-based dis-info threads that went no where? The Q anon thing is half a year old now, and NOTHING that was predicted has happened. Not a single thing. Remember when "Hillary is in Guantanamo" was a thing here when she was clearly NOT in Guantanamo?

                 <p>

                   I have no issue with what you are pointing out. It's great to remember! My only issue was the kike thing since most of the people here who throw that around tend to be hung up on it and not really contribute anything else or see the broader issues.

                         Only a complete fucking idiot thinks the masses are placated.  The masses are on stand-by and if you think they are going to put up with another 7 years of this shit, you're a fucking retard.  But actually, you're a faggot shill.  Have you been compromised like Brennan and Gowdy?  That is the only two possibilities.  lol

                          I'm not a shill. If I was a shill I would be telling you pizzagate isn't real. The masses ARE NOT on standby. I doubt even 5% of the population have even considered the possibility that there might be elite pedo-cults, let alone that pedo-cults control the world. Most people can not accept it, its too painful. When I realized that was what was happening I went though all the stages of grief as my old conception of the world had died.

                         <p>
                          The people who are awake have a very low capacity for offensive militaristic action (we have lots of boomers and fatties, we need young, physically and spiritually fit warriors).
                         </p>
                         <p>
                          You can't reply to my points because you know that if you did you would have to arrive at the same conclusions that I have, and therefore go through the grieving process like I did.

                          Stay frosty. This shit makes me so sad sometimes that I cry.

            I'll believe it when I see it. Sealed indictments and gag orders are not helping the cause. These monsters need to be put front and center of public attention.

             Remember there's no actual evidence that any sealed indictment is going to be what people on this board imagine they will be.  All we have now is people hoping they will "pizzagate related."  That's it.
            </p>
            <p>
             The sealed indictment talk only sprang up when it was revealed that George Papadopolous had already plead guilty was an "active cooperator."
            </p>
            <p>
             Another factor in the sealed indictment meme is that Mueller and Trump are secretly working together.
            </p>
            <p>
             Does anyone have any reason other than hoping it's true why the sealed indictments are relevant?

               He doesn't have that power.   That's at the heart of the whole Q fantasy, that a president has the power to do all this.  He doesn't.  Because we have a republic, not a dictatorship.  Have you noticed how often his policies have been stayed or overturned in court?

                AWS, I sure hope you have a good therapist. Your "awakening" is going to be traumatic. NO ONE following Q thinks Trump can do this on his own, and to state such is either ignorant as fuck, or straight up disingenuous. In fact, anyone seriously following Q is doing so because they are curious about how a small group of whitehats inside a massive, corrupt bureaucracy is going to be able to pull off the operation. The US government bureaucracy is like a giant, impacted colon that is so full of desiccated shit it is starting to necrotize. We're way beyond Miralax, here. It's likely to take a surgical bowel resection. Of course Trump's policies are blocked at every turn.
               </p>
               <p>
                Using this fact to dismiss Q and everything we've uncovered here, and will continue to uncover, is foolhardy.

                 All you are saying Trump is going to have help with these illegal actions bevause of a small group you call whitehats.   I would call coup plotters because the actions contemplated - secret arrests and roundups to Gitmo, etc would be illegal and they would be violation of any oath to protect tbe Constitution.
                </p>
                <p>
                 I'm also saying that these actions  will never take place, tbey are a fantasy LARP.  And it's not because of a corrupt bureaucracy,   but because of the greatness of the American system, because of limited executive power and the rule of law.
                </p>
                <p>
                 Any coup in any country involves many people.
                </p>
                <p>
                 You rhink I'm living in a fantasy and will have a harsh awakening.   I say that he Q phenomenon is a collective fantasy being played out  by people who can't even explain what Q level clearance means.

            If you think hes been waiting over a year yo stop the rape and torture of children then you have lost it. I get it, desperate people cling to any hope, but that ship has sailed.

             How do we know the arrests last year wasn't part of that? The media wouldn't tell us if it was. Honestly, this guy has been incorrect before so I don't buy it either.

              That is fine if you are not a fan of Zublick.  I do not follow him, but I came across the video and thought it to be a very good one. PLUS, as you can readily see, he was not my sole source.  The essence of the entire submission is merely to provide a little hope.  That is why we are all here, correct?  I know we are all getting tired of hoping, however, we are not giving up.

              I know you'll freak out and call me a shill but Zublick is a total sensationalist and never hesitates to throw wild unfounded (or even debunked) claims in his videos. I like him at first but had to unsub from him because it was getting out of hand.

               Funny, I was just going to respond then saw your above comment.  I do not like getting nasty with commenters, but lately, there have been an influx of bad-mouthers on this sub.  Constructive criticism and additional input is welcomed, but too many only have ill-intents.  Yeah, that's life and everything, but it just gets to you sometimes.  Many of us here work very hard to provide relevant and meaningful submissions.  Fine, if you do not agree, but provide some good info that we can all learn from.  So, with that being said, just disregard my rude comment.
