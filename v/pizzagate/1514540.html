            I have a few people in my personal life who are the types that will grab a headline that tells them what they want to hear and then use it as 'fact' without checking any of its content, and all of them back off reeal fast from Snopes when they are questioned.
           </p>
           <p>
            Talked with one of them just the other day who mentioned that they "fact check" things with Snopes. They had initially claimed that they link people to Snopes articles in order to show people the "facts" and then quickly changed their story to that use Snopes just to "fact check" for themselves but don't show others. Then I asked them why they trust Snopes and do they ever check the claims that Snopes is making. Then they quickly changed their story to that they haven't used Snopes in a long time so maybe Snopes isn't as credible anymore, they're not sure.
           </p>
           <p>
            Within 10 minutes they went from championing Snopes and claiming they are "fact checking" people using Snopes in debates, to claiming that they haven't used Snopes in years and so maybe it's not credible anymore, and all I had to do was ask them questions.

            Also remember Pizzagate isn't a conspiracy theory.  It's an investigation.  Individual concepts which coagulate within that investigation can (potentially) be debunked, but the investigation itself can't.
           </p>
           <p>
            The entire basis for the Mockingbird media narrative is wrong.  There never was a "fake news" Pizzagate story, because we've never put one out, fake or otherwise.  We've just been digging and discussing what is found.  So the news stories proclaiming Pizzagate to be a "fake news story" are, and could only ever have been, fake news stories.
           </p>
           <p>
            This is the "fake news" weapon they've been shooting at us with:

             You know what's super ironic about the whole thing, is that the story from the MSM about the gunman was that first he heard of pizzagate by "word of my mouth" and then researched it further once he had access to the internet. So first of all that is pretty hard to believe. Like what, he was in a grocery store and suddenly someone walked up to him like, "Yo check out pizzagate," lol, yeah no.
            </p>
            <p>
             But then they also say he accessed a "fake news" story about there being child sex slaves kept in the basement of CPP. Well, where did he see that story? The MSM can't say, though they tried to pin it on InfoWars. I'm not a fan of InfoWars by any means at all, but I saw the pizzagate video they put out and it never said that there were child sex slaves in a basement in CPP.
            </p>
            <p>
             Know who actually did start circling that theory? The MSM lol. So then assuming it wasn't a staged event, that means the gunman got his "fake news" from the MSM and then panicked and committed a crime. So.. way to go, MSM. Your fake news inspired a violent crime.
