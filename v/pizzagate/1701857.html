<p>I\'m actually very suprised by Mr. Franco\'s choice of screenplay, or maybe I am not, it could go either way.

            Geez I'm glad you chose a slow news cycle to fuck with me or it might impede with my work. But, you see, I know I am going to be encountering folks like you so you really are no sweat off my back. I'm sure this is causing you much more anxiety than it is me, especially since you are taking the risk of telling people you are anonymous. Lol, I mean, WHO does that? WHO actually claims to be part of Anonymous unless you are a nutbag like that Sheriff Sands from the Hampstead Childrens debacle?

            We will figure this out bud, one way or the other.

            I'll just consign myself to having to do battle with you each and every time you show up. I've done nothing wrong and am not a shill, my threads speak for themselves, and you do not care to refute the material I write about you have made me your target, regardless if I try to talk logically about what actually happened on that thread. We both know  you attached yourself to me then. You did not come from some mysterious place on the internet or anonymous as a freedom fighter for the cause. You have latched on to an ordinary guy who see's the world as I have described. I have no Intel employ and your premise for this attack is all wrong. If you were serious about change you would not target me because their are many other big fish out there that are really shilling for the cult. You and I, we have to squash this. I want to talk amicably about this, correct your misconceptions about me, figure out what it is that pissed you off so  virulently and so I can apologize. If you won't or can't give me that chance then I will assume, and the rest of the forums we visit together will assume as well, that you are simply incapable of doing so and have other motivations behind this trolling. Anyone with an intellect would help me understand where my premise is wrong in the material. But your premise rests on the idea of 'socking' to make myself look good. And no matter what I say about how it REALLY went down you are HELL BENT on making it look like that's the ultimate proof I'm a shill. Its the weakest argument anyone's ever heard AND YOU ARE PUTTING IN A TON OF EFFORT TO MAINTAIN THAT. Honey, that's not freedom fighting that's mental illness. Others can see it, its disturbing that you can't. NO ONE, in my 20 years of knowing and researching this 'thing' we live in, has ever gone to such lengths to convince others Im deceiving them, when by simply reading the material, and knowing something about conspiracy, anyone can tell that that's really how it has been going down. If you think you know better then please enlighten me. But until you are able to do that there's only two other reasons your so persistent, your getting paid or your batshit crazy. The latter is why  I'm so persistent, I kind of have a love/hate going on trying to understand the what, why, who and where of you. Keep following though, we will have a fun ride, you might learn something, but rest assured, I'm not as embarrassed about socking as you think I am and someday, in one of our forums, I will make an example out of you.

            James Franco and Marina Abramovic dated yeah like WTF.  He also poses as a tranny in Terry Richardsons Magazine Candy.  Terry Richardson, Abramovic both worked with Lady Gaga on the creative process in multiple Tranny Gaga videos.  Abramovic Jewish roots have been censored and Lady Gaga parents are Catholic and Jewish.  I personally believe the witch Abramovic is a Tranny.  I have a few Lady Gaga video decodes I have done and it's pretty strange.  Terry Richardson is an MKULTRA gateway programmer.

            Yeah maybe but anything that Megan Kelly says happened I am going to believe the opposite now.  The other lady I always liked but I could see they could of forced her to make the claims when they did.

            I think they fired Ailes with fake charges that the Globalist cooked up to destroy him during this election.  They knew Clinton was in the fight of her satanic life so they went all in on Clinton.  They planned to take a left turn after the bitch won.  But she didnt win and Fox is throwing out the liberal trash to go back to their fake FAUX conservative position.  But make no mistake when the big issues come up, when the chips are down the Globalist will call on fox to spin spin spin as hard as they can.

            Wow the movie takes place at Rosewood Mental Institution.  I used to live in Owingsmills Md where it is.  One night my friends and I went to smoke weed in a Graveyard near by the Institute and I lost my car keys in the Graveyard.  I had to walk like six miles back and went right through the campus at like 3am in the morning.  It was very creepy and I ran as fast as I could.   Who knew there was something much scarier than Ghost to worry about that night.  Maryland seems to have lots of MKULTRA related stuff.
           </p>
           <p>
            I knew a girl 15 years ago who was only 20 years old.  She was very mentally challenged.  She seems to fit exactly into a MKULTRA sex bot.  Her step father was working for the Government.  She was beautiful but just sexually crazy.  She had run away from home at 15 but went back.  She had a history of working at a strip club in Baltimore when she was underage.  Used to turn tricks under the stage.  She would treat you like shit if you were nice to her but would get real sexual and aroused when you grew mad and grabbed and shoved her a little.   When I stopped she was very disappointed.   We hung out for over a year almost every other day and I got to know her very well.  She would not have sex unless she was high or being paid or she was trying to get drugs.  I never would pay anything so went the whole time not having any sex with her.  It was the strangest friendship I have ever had in my life.
           </p>
           <p>
            I spent countless hours trying to figure out what was wrong with her.  I found a library book that had a part about borderline personality and I brought it to her and told her this was what I thought was her problem.  I also told her I was certain she had been sexually abused.  She never did deny the abuse and she kept the damn book intentionally and I had to pay for it.  I look back after all these years and remember almost everything we did together.  I am almost 100% certain she was MKULTRA.
           </p>
           <p>
            She could be so cruel but so nice at the same time.  There was something special about her but something horribly broken.
           </p>
           <p>
            She had a best friend that killed her own mother in their house and stayed with the body getting high on heroin for three days walking over the body.  She had another best friend that got strangled to death in Reisterstown by a guy who claimed it was during rough sex.  Story always seemed very odd.
           </p>
           <p>
            I think there are thousands and thousands of poor souls who have had their whole life direction changed by these horrible people.  They just use people like cattle.  It is all so depressing.

             Had a similar experience.  Could've writen your post word for word.  I think there're many former victims suffering from BPD as adults.
            </p>
            <p>
             Had a coworker with 20 years experience with these types of women. Her son was dating a girl who is BPD. Whenever her son tried to break up the Gf would try to kill herself. Put herself in the hospital, hit herself to cause marks and call the cops.  The grooming process as kids, the abuser is nice gives them things pulls them in close then hurts them. So it can be hard to trust people who appear kid, especially males.
            </p>
            <p>
             My coworker said there's no help for the really bad ones. As they get older past 27 towards 40 the memories they been pushing down star to come back and many can have psychotic breaks.  I've seen 2 ladies myself horrifically abused whonbreak down and end up institutionalize on psych meds.  War on drugs won't allow therapists to use these native medicines any more. Last thing tptb want is recovered abuse victims.

             has a post where op documented his use of microdosing shrooms, lsd and San Pedro cactus to almost... almost cure and relieve his symptoms.  There's tons of research pre drug war about MDMa therapy etc to help ptsd. Fuck the DEA.
            </p>
            <p>
             Edit:  appear kind
Amber Lyon former CNN reporter has done stories about troops using shrooms to help each other get over ptsd. Can you imagine millions of survivors healing with plant medicines, speaking out and pointing fingers? Fuck the FDA

               Mescaline is the active chem in San Pedro.
Natives called it San Pedro because St Peter holds the keys to heavens gates. They use it to open up the heart energy and heal the body.  It's not as visually triply as other psychs.  The ceremonies are daytime in nature.

            All the big media is Pedophile propaganda Globalist crap.  Fox had the role of controlled opposition to give the illusion of choice in media.  They got exposed as just a Globalist tool in the last couple of months.  Murdoch got all his seed money from Rothschild interest.

            Does anyone remember Franco's 16-17 year old girlscandal where he was ilicitly texting a youg fan he met outside of his play?
           </p>
           <p>
            Also, he was on Colbert recently and Stephen congratulated him on his new course being taught at a highschool in Palo Alto CA.  He is a creep for sure.

            Here's an article on links between the entertainment industry and Crowley's Thelema nonsense organization called the Order of the Eastern Temple or OTO, which Franco has ties to.  They have a website with their lodge locations and membership dues. They have a blog called zero=two. Jay Z seems to like their glorified yolo motto of "do what thou wilt" and occasionally wears his "do what thou wilt" shirt.  This ain't your great great great great grandfather's illuminism anymore. It's mostly complete stupidity but with some of the old perversion still intact.  #spiritcooking

            Postulating that one organization is literally omnipotent is a sure way to make PG look dumb. Your views on the media are so bizarre no one would recognize them.  I'm particularly amused to hear that non-whites are maligned unfairly to make whites, who are apparently cowards all, scared of them when in fact there's a blanket ban on publishing that a fugitive or suspect is nonwhite.
            <br/>
            Can't imagine what your theory on conservatives dominating talk radio -- can't be that we live in more rural areas and have to drive more and develop longer attention spans and deeper understanding of issues, rush Limbaugh is a psyop!

            How does this relate to Pizzagate you say?
