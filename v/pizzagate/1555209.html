<p>One of the first things that struck me about this Church called &quot;The Church of Pilgrims&quot; was from up above it looks like it is surrounding properties so they are kind of hidden. <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/Pilgrimage/@38.9105298,-77.052275,226a,20y,90h,45t/data=!3m1!1e3!4m5!3m4!1s0x0:0xce87154791bdcef1!8m2!3d38.9105993!4d-77.0491581">https://www.google.com/maps/place/Pilgrimage/@38.9105298,-77.052275,226a,20y,90h,45t/data=!3m1!1e3!4m5!3m4!1s0x0:0xce87154791bdcef1!8m2!3d38.9105993!4d-77.0491581</a></p>
<p>I almost wrote this up before checking out this 2222 Q ST address. A mansion on Airbnb came up and it is the property back there. Get this, it says it has a fucking ping pong table it says and the guys descriptions says &quot;My passion and work in Haiti consumes most of my day outside of work in the fitness industry.&quot; Haiti, again!</p>

<p>Also in the desciption &quot;The house is located in the safest neighborhood in all of DC. In addition to the Secret service permanently stationed a half a block away from the house, we also have security cameras installed all the way around the outside of the house and in the common areas of the house such as the entrance, first floor and stairwells.&quot; I\'m not seeing on the map why SS would be half a block away.</p>
<p>The church has displayed an LGBT flag on the front. Next to it is the Pilgrimage. It is apparently some kind of hostel. On their website they have something called &quot;Programming&quot;, wtf? <a href="http://www.thepilgrimage.org/">http://www.thepilgrimage.org/</a></p>

<p>What led me to this was trying to figure out where children would come from. My thinking is maybe somewhere along Rock Creek. </p>
<p>A little south along the creek is the Qatar Embassy which recently had a get together with many Congressman and has at least 3 places with children very close and a pediatrician. Also behind it, it has a strange amount of open field leading all the way up to around where this Church is. Just strange to see so much open field in the heart of DC.</p>

            Hi
            <strong>
             OP
            </strong>
            I have worked on a couple of threads recently regarding tunnels etc and have found some very interesting stuff around a particular very long tunnel. I also feel that something isn't quite right about
            <strong>
             The Pilgrimage
            </strong>
            .
           </p>
           <p>
            Read this thread first for context
            <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/v/pizzagate/1568106">
             https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1568106
            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            Then read my comment in reply to this thread
            <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/v/pizzagate/1551092/7651790">

            Somehow I don't see the connection. I checked his facebook and yes he makes a comment about comet pizza, but I don't think this is damming evidence... we have to be careful here. Comments like 1000 upvotes good work?

            There are numerous articles about ritual sacrifice going on in the park. I'd try to find out where those have taken place. Most likely, it's people like that that have accessed the park through secret entrances. Those would be the ones most likely to know where they were. I'll try to find that article on the park. There's a lot of bad going on there according to it.

            If you read the reviews on the airbnb site it has conflicting reviews as if some reviews were from a location IN Haiti. Strange. What I also gathered was  he no longer hosts events although he has the past. Only a few reviews had actual dates. One event that was hosted said that he used his surveillance camera footage to count "guests" that arrived. And one reviewer said she found it odd that he came in during their stay unannounced to do some maintenance on the house.

The guy was running an illegal concert venue for a long time. The galling thing is he owns a chain of gyms in DC (Results), he is well aware of the licensing requirements involved so it isn't like he can play dumb."

            While Bing sucks for most things, use Bing Maps 'birds eye view'. You can rotate, and see far more detail than in google maps.

              The images are taken from planes flying over, so you can literally get four different angles anywhere.  They are not just top-down images like on google maps, so you get sort of a 45-degree view of everything which makes sides of buildings, landscape details, etc... much easier to pick out.  Like, you can see concrete slabs, and old structure (like an old, collapsed bridge) in Rock Creek park for instance.
