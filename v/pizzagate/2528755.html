<p>PuttItOut, so glad to hear you spent some quality time away. Burnout is a terrible thing to carry. Sometimes, we just need a break.</p>
<p>Wherever you decide to go from here with Voat, you should be proud you have already changed the world and made it a better place.</p>
<p>I don\'t know how closely you follow pizzagate happenings, or the White House leaker known as &quot;Q&quot;, but the thousands of threads of research posted by pizzagoats over the past year and a half and graciously and courageously hosted by you is constantly accessed by those attempting stop the trafficking of kids and fight elite corruption. Someone on 8chan called Voat &quot;the largest knowledgebase of pedophile research and researchers in the world.&quot; We\'ve become the place parents whose kids are being groomed come to find out how to get cops to do something about it. The place survivors come to put their stories on the record and make sense of the terrible things that have happened to them. The place folks can find now-scrubbed evidence of elite corruption and the network of interwoven relationships that protects it. I\'ve been told repeatedly that people in high places are paying attention, and the fact that we\'re the most shilled spot on the internet leads me to believe it\'s probably true. With hundreds of resignations of powerful people, over 24,000 sealed indictments piled up, and some of the first ones unsealed having directly to do with elite child trafficking, I think the day is coming soon when your mom will be bragging to her friends about her son\'s free-speech website and the role it played in the Great Awakening. :-)</p>

             That's what we are doing.  Making sure these devils are exposed for what they are.  I often wonder how long this will take.  The answer is, As Long As It Takes!  They have been planning and at this for decades and maybe longer.  We Have Only Just Begun.  We are  Truth Warriors.

            Voat is hands down the most informative and important forum I’ve ever come across. The effort and courage of Puttitout and the researchers on here is incomparable and the world needs to see more of what you have to offer. I believe this is one of the last sites on the internet that is committed to exposing the elite pedophile rings that would otherwise remain hidden, being the deceptive cowards they are. Please keep your legacy going. It is crucial.

            that's funny since the majority of threads are now Q-related itself and lead absolutely nowhere.  YOU are the lead shill everyone except the women can plainly see.

            that doesn't even make sense, faggot, because 99% of posters are SPECTATORS ANYWAY and literally nothing depends on them nor the Q memes they spread to ten family members.

            a real shill would redirect the few hours a week we might have toward useless shit and attempt to obfuscate the fact that the PG is merely one SYMPTOM of our JEWISH PROBLEM.  which describes precisely what you do.

            People on this website do authentic research that exposes the evil that exists in people. Anyone who partakes in pedophilia, satanism, and human sacrifice is beyond comprehensible and needs to be brought to justice. I am in awe of the dedicated people who share their findings with the hope that this evil be brought to light so it can be ended.

            This is one of very few surviving sites dedicated to outing the satanic pedophile elites who control everything. There are more red pilled folks now than when PG first broke. Stay the course. This is so important and will help bust the lid on those who think they are above the law.

            Thank you for this place where like-minded people can bring their thoughts and theories without fear of censorship, where people like me who have been victims of child sex abuse can come and try and help the new generation of children and the utterly amazing investigative skills can be utilised by some truly extraordinary people here.
           </p>
           <p>
            When I first used this board I was doubted by a couple of people who thought I might be a fake when I talked about my past and knowing a couple of people who were victims of elite UK paedophiles. Hopefully I have changed their minds and whilst I don't post an awful lot I do intently follow the threads with such intrigue and distain for the outside world where people have way too much money that they have to buy their next fetish at the cost of young lives.
           </p>
           <p>
            I am grateful to you and every contributor who puts in the time and effort to try and stop these wicked people from killing more innocents.
           </p>
           <p>
            Thank you all.

            Without this site, more children will die.  I'm confident our research is being used to expose and prosecute pedophiles by law enforcement.
