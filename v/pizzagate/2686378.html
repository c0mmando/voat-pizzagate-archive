<p>&quot;Swimming against the tide of promises to crack down on abuse and cover-up led by Pope Francis, a newly created Mexican cardinal said that some accusers should be “ashamed” to point their finger at clerics because many of them have skeletons in their own closets.</p>
<p>The victims of pedophilia who “accuse men of the Church should [be careful] because they have long tails that are easily stepped on,” said Cardinal Sergio Obeso Rivera.</p>
<p>The cardinal, emeritus Archbishop of Xalapa, in Veracruz, Mexico, spoke to journalists before a celebration he led in his former diocese.</p>
<p>Even though he acknowledged that some allegations are true, he went after the victims and avoided referring to the Pennsylvania grand jury report in the United States that found some 300 abusive priests in a span of seven decades in six dioceses.</p>
<p>Obeso Rivera’s words came last week, after the report was made public.</p>
<p>“I’m here happy to talk about nice things, not about problematic things, it’s an accusation that is made, and in some cases it’s true. But the evil of many is the consolation of fools, because sometimes those who accuse men of the Church should [be careful] because they have long tails that are easily stepped on.”</p>
<p>However, he did say that the accusations “make us feel bad and we want to improve.”</p>
<p>Obeso Rivera was made a cardinal by Pope Francis on June 28. As the prelate is over 80, he will not be participating in the eventual conclave to choose the pontiff’s successor.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;The Church’s sex scandal also touched Obeso Rivera’s Mexico.</p>
<p>Father Marcial Maciel Dogollado was defrocked by Pope Benedict in 2006 after being found guilty by the Church of sexually abusing nine boys and young men. After he died, it was discovered he had fathered a child with one of his two mistresses and might have abused his own children. Dogollado died in Florida in 2008 at the age of 87.&quot;</p>

<p>EDIT to add my take:</p>
<p>Given the timing, I think it\'s likely the appointment of this cardinal was strategic.  Francis seats a disposable cardinal to publicize what he can\'t--a reminder to victims of what they were threatened with as they were being raped and molested if they spoke a word of it.  Death to them and their families?  Supporting this theory is that the cardinal was speaking to journalists when he delivered the threat.  The message was deliberately planned for public distribution far and wide.</p>',

            This is usually how things are covered over. The threat of incrimination, the threat of violence, the threat towards people’s families and their livelihoods, the threat of anything they can get their hands on - are all ways of controlling people. I’ve seen it in miniature.

               GREAT news, Carmencita! Former US nuncio, Arbp. Vigano has just released a bombshell 11-page memo detailing how Pope Francis repealed the sanctions Pope Benedict had placed on Cardinal McCarrick and allowed McCarrick to have free rein. Vigano names many cardinals and bishops complicit in covering up the clerical abuse crisis in the American hierarchy and the Vatican and calls on Pope Francis and the complicit hierarchy to resign immediately:

               This is bombshell stuff. He released his memo in the middle of the night in Italy. Pope just waking up to the bad news now. Unprecedented for a high-ranking archbishop to break ranks like this. It's happening, Carmencita. Pope Francis is finished.

                God, I hope you are right.  But this Lavender Mafia still holds court in the Vatican.  There needs to be a total cleansing there, possibly an exorcism of the whole area even surrounding it.  That place gives me the willies when I look at it.  Evil Place.   jorge was not loved in Ireland and now this. 0:)

                  He seems extremely mortified by the pope's actions having tried many times to make others do their duties to no avail.  He writes how McCarrick invited as many as 5 seminarians into his bed at one time.  Sometimes serving communion afterwards.  A sacrilege beyond comprehension.  I am thoroughly disgusted.  No wonder jorge banished benedict from the Vatican.  And why he is living behind iron gates with guards and attended by nuns.  He basically is under arrest, to some extent.  I believe the Archbishop is incensed but I have also heard that this is a very fragile time and the Conservatives of the Vatican are pushing for the ousting of the pope to arrange a type of coup.  To appoint their own man.  I just want that Lavender Mafia out of there. That is a good way to start the Housecleaning.

              Sorry, forgot to reply!  I read it and used it to comment in here.  I also sent it to my special friend Stcharles.  I remember reading about the Lavender Mafia before.  I had no idea they estimate that 50% of priests are gay or have homosexual tendencies.  Plus after reading this, you can only surmise they are trying to increase the numbers for their own agenda.  So Sick.

               That was the first time I had heard of the Lavender Mafia. I know that estimate is shocking. Not surprised about the use of blackmail to keep them quiet. I believe it was on HLN today that they had some of the abuse victims that have been coming out in droves. There was this one man that said he would do drugs and volunteer for the abuse because he knew he could handle it, and didn't want some of the other altar boys to go through it. My heart broke for him and what he endured. Actually it breaks for all of them.

                Oh my God, what a horrible thing to have to live through.  He surely figured they would get to him anyway.  The poor man. I can't eve imagine how many Victims there are.  Thousands for sure. It sounds like the Blackmail game they play with the politicians.  Finding something from their personal life and then they have them.  I wonder if there are sex tapes too on film they use.  God this stuff is awful.

            RITUAL ABUSE AND MIND CONTROL 
The Hierarchy of the Occult – Svali Blog Post 2018
The occultic world operates within a hierarchy model, and the groups that are occultic are very aware of this hierarchy – and the rules that govern it.
           </p>
           <p>
            In each nation, there are local cult groups that operate, that often report to national and/or international groups that oversee their region. For an active cult member to move to a new region, they must often get permission from both the local groups, and the larger groups that oversee them.
           </p>
           <p>
            Throughout the world, there are 12 international occultic groups around the world that have been given established territories and privileges within those regions, and one that oversees them all.
           </p>
           <p>
            The Twelve international groups include the Illuminati, Rosicrucians, Knights Templar, Knights of Malta, Opus Dei, Magnificat , Trinity, Manus Deum,  and four others (including one with its headquarters in Jerusalem).
           </p>
           <p>
            Overseeing all of these groups is one based in Rome: The Jesuits (Society of Jesus).  All other occultic societies acknowledge the headship of the Jesuits, and their pivotal role in bringing in the New World Order.
           </p>
           <p>
            I know, because I was a Jesuit; this was the part of my history that was formerly missing earlier in my healing. My Illuminati memories are real, but they were the “cover” programming to hide my past. One of the best kept secrets of the Jesuits is that since 1912, they allowed women into their order (and programmed them from infancy on as agents) – and that since 1975, they could be a ranking general (the Jesuits have 12 top generals, each who oversees a territory in the United States, who all report to their Superior General, commonly known as the Black Pope).  I know, because before I left the Order, I was fourth general and the head trainer for the Jesuits, the first woman to achieve that rank.

            -If true, makes total sense why the Catholic Church is never, ever held accountable. 
And what's up with so many of the pedo priests "retiring" down to FL? 
This priest's comments are disgusting &amp; reprehensible! He's showing a great deal about himself by his statement.

            Unless the Mexican priests are in with the cartels, homeboy better watch his ass. Cartels kill politicians like they are roaches down there. It is not much of a switch if the priests start getting gunned down as well.
           </p>
           <p>
            But then again I would be willing to bet some that collection plate money gets handed over to the cartels, in exchange for kids that won't be missed. In that case someone needs to figure out a way to drive a wedge between the cartels and the church and the problem will solve itself.

             It has already started. This article is actually from last year.  Somebody has it in for the priests.  Pray Tell, whatever for.  Hmm.

             the staff arrived, they found the 71-year-old priest dead in his room with his hands and feet tied and a stab wound in his neck and chest.

             Villa is the 18th priest to be murdered in Mexico in the last six years, with many more having been assaulted or kidnapped. In May, a priest was stabbed at the conclusion of Mass in Mexico City’s Cathedral, though he survived the attack.

            Here is my take. The Jesuits and the secret societies are intertwined. These same secret societies are also prevalent at the Ivy League schools. All of these entities are intertwined and joined at the hip.

             Yes yes yes.  This post right here, says it.  It's the jesuits, they run everything.  It's not the Jews.  Trump is jesuit educated as well, and his new supreme court justice, also catholic.

              It's worth noting that Trump only spent 2 years at Fordham before transferring to Wharton.  And he is a Presbyterian, not Catholic.

               So?  That doesn't mean anything.  Apostate protestantism (presbyterian being part of it), is just as catholic as the vatican in terms of running things.

            The Catholic Church should be declared a criminal organization, disbanded, all its assets seized, all its clergy executed, and all the contents of the Vatican Library scanned at high resolution and published on the fucking internet, including the shit about the aliens.
           </p>
           <p>
            No more half-measures. Burn the entire organization to the ground.

             Jesus, man. I’m a catholic, and I’m not sure you aren’t correct. If I were to counteroffer, I’d say everything above local churches, and probably some of them, too.

            <p>
             If the pope wants to protect pedophiles, and I’m not sure he doesn’t, he needs to make a monastery with a big guarded outer wall, and put them all inside to live lives of solitary contemplation.  With no visitors, and certainly no children.

            There are plenty organizations besides the Catholic church that these non human entities hide behind. They just happened to be one of the oldest and least successful at hiding their sins. Look up any earthly organization of men who claim to represent God and I am sure you will find accusations of sexual abuse against children. In my opinion, this is to discourage most from getting close to the creator. Keep in mind that earthly organizations who claim to represent him most likely do not in actuality. And if such a being exists he is more powerful than requiring us to wade through an ocean of pedophiles to find him.

            Seriously. Evil is EVERYWHERE, including religions (prime spot for evil). Religions don't shield themselves from evil infiltration (strategically accomplished). Their mission is to DESTROY religion. People who will "throw the baby out with the bathwater" are their target. REMEMBER the Word, does NOT advocate evil. The message is GOOD. Goodness is WORTH pursuing. Imagine a world without evil. Imagine a world that without GOOD. Decide where you WANT to live FOREVER. That is what the Bible is ALL about.

             They have. Churches are empty. Isn't it part of the problem in the west. We turned our back on that which our culture was built on. Rather than just turn our backs on the organised religion we turned our backs on everything that makes us us. All the while building up and celebrating Islam. 
The Church are nothing more than a procurement arm for the elite pedophiles. Working hand in had to select isolated children who won't be missed by loving parents.

              Yes, you really have to wonder if pedophilia is a feature and not a bug of the church. After all, who would be attracted to same sex abstinent monastic life other than...gays and gay pedophiles. It is completely unnatural for anyone with normal sexuality. And that they would attempt to hide their sexual corruption under the cover of an explicitly moral institution also does not seem coincidental. While obviously for most lay people the church remains a moral anchor, for the leadership is does seem to be a well oiled, well funded abuse machine. And maybe this has been the case from its earliest inception.

              Could it be because Catholic Priests claim to be God's representative on Earth while they engage in RAPING CHILDREN?  Or is it because they claim the authority to burn in Hell the soul of anyone who dares to tell the truth about them?  Or maybe it is because rather than helping their victims who somehow collect the courage to come forward in an attempt to end the horror perpetrated on innocent children by them,  they prefer to sleeze and slime, and continue the abuse of their child victims in the Court system, hoping to avoid the responsibility for their crimes, and save a little of their "filthy lucre" to build more palaces and cathedrals to
              <em>
               the glory of God
              </em>
              .  Take your pick.  Or select another of the many reasons the sick, degenerate clergy of the Roman Catholic Church get
              <strong>
               Incalculably  less
              </strong>

                I'm sorry to hear that. A good friend won a lawsuit against the church for what he went through. It's sickeneing and sad. What's also sad is he's still a devout catholic!
