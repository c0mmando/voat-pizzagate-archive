<p>A judge allowed a man convicted of raping a woman when she was 12 years old to have joint custody of her child, despite being convicted of raping another child in a separate incident.
Christopher Mirasalo, 27, of Brown City, Michigan, raped the woman, who became pregnant as a result of the crime, nine years ago when he was 18 years old, KCCI reported.</p>
<p>A judge awarded Mirasalo joint legal custody of the child and parenting time after a paternity test confirmed that he was the father of the child.</p>
<p>Mirasalo, who was convicted of sexual assault for the first woman in 2008, also served a four-year prison sentence for sexually assaulting another child.</p>
<p>The now 21-year-old victim is trying to legally block Mirasalo’s access to her child under the Rape Survival Child Custody Act, the Detroit News reported.</p>
<p>The victim’s attorney argued Mirasalo forcibly raped and terrorized her client with death threats in September 2008.</p>
<p>Athough Mirasalo was charged with felony first-degree rape, a judge granted him a plea deal where he could plead guilty for a charge of attempted rape, which carries a maximum penalty of five years behind bars.</p>
<p>The judge sentenced Mirasalo to one year behind bars for that offense, but he only served six and a half months after he got permission to care for his sick mother.</p>
<p>He was charged again for criminal sexual assault in March 2010 for raping a victim between 13 and 15 years old and pleaded no contest before a judge sentenced him to prison in that case.</p>',

            She could take matters into her own hands since the justice system is obviously corrupt. She is probably under extreme duress and might even suffer from PTSD. 
Rightfully, so.
And, ask for a jury trial.

            If people would start flooding the Counties and Cities these judges work in with civil suits against the city or county some of this nonsense would stop. I don't know if you could file a civil suit against a judge but I think you might be able to file one against an city, county, or agency. Not sure how that works.

            They're punishing her for not taking the free abortion. It made them look bad with the ole "what about if a 12 year old gets pregnant during a rape" argument that really never legit comes up when she decided to keep the kid.

            There are some really dumb ass judges out there. I tell people to learn as much as possible about the person that is running for Family Court judge.  These people have the right to remove your kids from you, give to rapist like above etc., so you better find out if they are competent to understand the rule of law.

            I know .... I can't f&amp;cking believe this! She should have had a restraining order and an order of protection.

            And that mother needs counseling. He screwed with her head, too. He's a monster.

            Oh My God.  This has to  STOP.  That Judge should be thrown in jail with the Rapist.  Is that Rapist providing any type of Sexual Services for the Judge or friends of the Judge or Political Elites?   Something smells very fishy about him getting a tap on the wrist for that crime and allowing him near that child.  That is possibly creating another Pedo Crime.
