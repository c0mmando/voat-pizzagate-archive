But the mainstream news claimed that police found out about the shooting from their ShotSpotter system, which tracks the sound of gunshots via hidden recording technology around the city then sends the location of the gunshots to police digitally....
This is a clear contradiction. The police said they “heard” the shots at 4:19. But the papers reported that they learned about the shooting from ShotSpotter alerts, which take 30 to 45 seconds to transmit, at 4:20.Metropolitan Police Department spokeswoman told Big League Politics that officers learned about the shooting “Through ShotSpotter technology,” pointing to a public incident report that lists “R-1 CIC ShotSpotter” as the reporting person at 4:20.

<p>Another question I have is why the police report doesn\'t mention the bruises and torn watch. When does that happen? If Seth was talking to his GF until up to the time he was shot, wouldn\'t he have told her that he had gotten beat up? The only explanation for this to me is that the cops inflicted the bruising after he was shot, or it happened in the ambulance.</p>

            The thing you have to remember is shotspotter doesn't work.  They installed it in a city near me and discontinued use after it was found to be ineffective.  It reports everything as shots.  It made a small town look like Syria.  400 plus shots a night reported.  actual number zero.

             ha, that's funny. Shotspotter was rankling me, being added to the police report after the fact, so I did a quick scan earlier about Shotspotter, looking for anyone familiar in the Directors/Corporate Admin but nothing stood out. Somebody else should double check. They seem to be in a lot of places. Maybe this is a whole new rabbithole.

            I'd opine this is a minor contradiction at best, that it's not impossible that both officers and ShotSpotter reported.  The time also appears consistent.

            In the original press conference the spokesman says the officers heard the shots, if it was ShotSpotter I think he would have said so, like a "see how well it works" thing.
           </p>
           <p>
            Also, same spokesman, same press conference, he made a possible slip in saying "he was taken to local hospital, where he ALSO succumbed to his injuries" as in (maybe) his assailant/s were already deceased.

             My internet is stalling the video, so I wonder when was this press conference? The 4channers are looking at 2 murdered in a gold astro van in a parking lot in Myrtle Beach on July 11, 12 hours later, unsolved, as possible shooters.

           <p>
            I bet they've been told to always say "heard" instead of "our ShotSpotter system heard" because they didn't want to remind people they use one.

             Thanks for your reply but that doesn't make sense, the initial police report is the that the Officers Heard the Shots, but all the papers and the later report claims that shotspotter reported the shots, it contradicts the idea that they don't want people to know about shotspotter, otherwise they would stick to the original report. Why change the report, unless you didn't want anyone to know that the cops were at the scene within only a minute or so. If the cops were that close, how could a shooters get away cleanly?

               <p>
                Yep. The problem with HRC is she started inhaling her own marketing smoke a long time ago and no one ever told her to stop because she surrounded herself with sycophants. It's not a lie if you believe it after all. But things turn south fairly quickly, there's like a 100% failure rate once someone starts getting high off their own shit.

              Yes, they are. And the shot shooter is  processed by a human monitor.
             </p>
             <p>
              the article says that in the major papers  that the shotshooter reported the shots at 4:20 which would mean realistically that the officers still needed a few minutes to put down their donuts and  respond, right? So that would give the shooters time to get away. But if the officers were only a minute or two away at 4:18, I would think its pretty likely that they would have seen fleeing shooters. In any case, its strange to change the report.
             </p>
             <p>
              According to the video, the shot shooter system has a relay time as it required human interpretation/analysis to process, so the shooting time of 4:18 is probably accurate.
