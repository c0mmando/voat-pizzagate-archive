            The chances of Alex Jones the radio show host and Stratfor being connected in some way is just about nil, no chance at all.

            One of the founders of Stratfor is George Friedman (Jewish), and giving my best estimate I would say Stratfor is an arm of the Israeli Mossad that works in both intelligence and operations in the US and elsewhere. Since the CIA is prohibited by law from operating in its home country (USA) it allows the presence of the Mossad in its various forms to do counter-intelligence and dirty tricks, probably including blackmail operations. The CIA knows and approves of many of these activities at the highest level because the two agencies are usually connected at the top, although disagreements and conflicts may occur. Basically Mossad and its offshoots, including sayanim, can do what the CIA is reticent to do because of possible legal and public relations ramifications.

            I heard or read somewhere that they ARE the CIA. Not sure if the source, so don't quote me on it. How does one get hired at the CIA? Find the worst people possible, preferably at Satanic rituals. Bad joke, sick of the sociopaths ruling the world.

             I know their emails were leaked. I read of them before the election.  Just wondering if anyone found more info on them since the winter - last time I remember a thread about them.  The search box on here Doesn't work for me on my phone.  I wanted to search for Stratfor threads b4 posting to see what was the latest scoop on them, but couldn't. But I mainly wanted to link everyone to victory if the lights tweets about Stratfor and pisillico

            Stratfor is a CIA contractor.  They do all manner of things for the CIA...they do run human trafficking and there were many threads about them when #pizzagate first blew up.  Lots of wikileaks.  Of particular interest, and should be of interest to us all is U.S. State Department's Michael J. Posillico...as mentioned above a twitter account called VictoryOfTheLight is dumping LOTS of information including 911.  It certainly looks like this Posillico was instrumental in 911...https://twitter.com/KibBitzLaw/status/873047953291624452

            Wheres anonymous? A few years ago it seems like they fought all forms of corruption...now nothing... keep hearing that action will take place and still nothing. Not NYPD. Not George Web or Donald Trump Or Sessions or wikileaks/Julian Assange or anyone. No one has stepped foward to challange people like Hillary or John Podesta or John Mccain and its infuriating.

             Can I ask you why you expect action to take place?
            </p>
            <p>
             There's been a consistent myth that the NYPD had this trove of evidence they copied in case the FBI didn't act.   It's virtually certain this was fake.   A hoax created in the last days of the election to drive the idea that the FBI had a bombshell coming.   Erik Prince told Steve Bannon this on Bannon's radio show.   However, both of these guys were working with the Trump campaign and would highly benefit from such a dirty trick.  At the time it was not known that Prince was secretly an adviser to the campaign, but that has since come out and his sister became Secretary of Education even though her back ground is not in education.  The FBI closed the Clinton case with no bombshell.  The Wiener case only involved Weiner. No bombshells.  No NYPD action.
            </p>
            <p>
             So perhaps the real question to ask is.  Is there anything that the NYPD or Trump or Sessions or Assange actually have on those targets?   Because it's pretty apparent they do not and this campaign to indicate they have has nothing at the core.   George Webb is in no position to know anything or to take action on anything.
            </p>
            <p>
             There's going to be some money-laundering cases coming down the pike, but not on Hillary, Podesta or McCain.

             Most truthers ignore Anonymous and are sceptical about them. Just my two cents. Consider that the MSM covers them just like Alex Jones. They are highly suspect.

             And one the most often cited proofs that Jones is tied to Stratfor is this Wikileaks Stratfor internal email:
             <a href="https://wikileaks.org/gifiles/docs/34/3490921_alex-jones-webmaster-candidate-1-scheduled-.html">
              https://wikileaks.org/gifiles/docs/34/3490921_alex-jones-webmaster-candidate-1-scheduled-.html
             </a>
            </p>
            <p>
             Of course Alex Jones is a very common name, and everyone knows Jones is no tech savvy webmaster who might be applying for a job at Stratfor as the email implies. But the proof Jones has no ties to Stratfor comes courtesy of those same wikileaks Stratfor emails:
             <a href="https://wikileaks.org/gifiles/docs/16/1658193_re-tactical-alex-jones-radio-show-.html">

             Jones started broadcasting around the time Stratfor was established, and this is also cited as proof of some kind, but if Jones was working for Stratfor since it's inception as often cited by conspiracy theorists, ummm...............wouldn't Stratfor know that?
            </p>
            <p>
             The email is unassailable proof Jones is not remotely working for or tied to Straftor. But that's not the only thing the email proves. It also proves the outrageously wicked deception used against Jones, because whoever first discovered the Stratfor email at wikileaks indicating an Alex Jones was being interviewed as a potential webmaster and then cited it over and over again all over the web as clear proof Jones was Straftor
             <strong>
              had to have also known about the other email I just cited
             </strong>
             which proves Alex Jones the radio show host was entirely unknown to Stratfor.
            </p>
            <p>
             That my friends, is deception at its deepest.

               Since the beginning of time when man first organized into tribes, enemies of the tribe that were captured were either killed or  absorbed into the tribe to strengthen it. Later, man would develop even more sophisticated groups and sub-groups of one kind or another, and while killing was still common, the benefits of exploiting the knowledge of a former group member was recognized to an even greater extent. The phenomenon sans murder is very common today in the worlds of industry and commerce. Do you know who Ford wants to hire as designers or technology specialists? Former GM designers or tech specialists. Do you know who Morgan Stanley wants to hire as financial analysts and executives? Former Goldman Sachs analysts and executives. That's just the way the world works.
              </p>
              <p>
               Back to Jones. Jones's business is battling the Deep State/shadow government, NWO, CFR, Trilateral Commission, military industrial complex, and the dark hats in the intelligence community comprised of NSA, CIA, etc. According to Wikipedia, Stratfor is an American geopolitical intelligence platform that provides services such as strategic intelligence, business intelligence, custom intelligence, written and multimedia analysis, corporate security analysis, and risk mitigation to agencies such as CIA, NSA, etc.
              </p>
              <p>
               Now if Jones's mandate is to counter the deep state/NWO/shadow government,NWO, CFR, Trilateral Commission, military industrial complex, and the dark hats in the intelligence community comprised of NSA, CIA, etc, which utilize Stratfor's services, and if every tribe or group since the dawn of man has utilized former members of the opposing tribe or group,
              </p>
              <h2>
               why in the world would Jones's Infowars want to be the first group in human history to turn down the opportunity to absorb someone from an opposing tribe? Why in the world would Jones
               <em>
                not
               </em>
               hire a former Stratfor employee, who could furnish him with precisely the kind of intelligence and insight that would help him meet his objective of combating the Deep State? Why in the world would Jones turn down the opportunity to hire someone with the chops to make a real difference in his efforts to battle the Deep State?
              </h2>
              <p>
               Here's blazing irony. Were it to be discovered that a former long time employee of Infowars was hired by the CIA, this would be held out as proof positive that Jones is CIA/Stratfor, or whatever the flavor of the day is, when in fact it would be the CIA exploiting the opportunity to gain deep insight into the workings of the truth movement network.

                Brilliant point. It's so easy to disinfo folks these days with rubbish connections. Most of connections used to throw wet blankets onto info around here are just garbarge. Remember a post from months ago saying the Pettingbone girl was an mkultra sex kitten based on two of her IG pictures where she was wearing fur coat hahah

                 A very good piece. Good read. 
As for Alex - bad news. He just had Media Whore / sociopath &amp; pedo cover-upper Megyn Kelly. You can see the comment section on that podcast - it's toxic! Alex has sold out 100%. Shame! From 'Endgame' (his masterpiece) to Megyn Kelly ( who trashes Trump ) &amp; NBC. But we still have David Icke who will never sell iut.

                  Jones merely granting an interview to Megyn Kelly means he sold out? I am thoroughly baffled that you liked my piece but could not extend the underlying concept I presented to talking to the sociopath Megyn Kelly. Jones will exploit for his own good purposes the opportunity that presented itself when Kelly approached Jones for an interview. Jones did not remotely capitulate on any issue. Merely talking to the enemy face to face in a friendly manner is not remotely a sign of kinship or whatever the hell you're reading into it. Talking to a major adversary in a civil way is simply how these things are done. You're read on this is pointed 180 degrees in the wrong direction. I have no other way to explain it except to say there is not a nanofiber's worth of selling out simply because Jones accepted the opportunity to give an interview to one of the NWO's main mouthpieces, for his own purposes.

                   Megyn Kelly protected potential child trafficker/murderer as did Alex Jones. Some people sell out others do not - that's life. David Icke never sold out - that is why I remain his loyal fan.

                    You are wrong on at least two counts. Jones was all over pizzagate and Alefantis for weeks (there is all kinds of video out there showing Jones and other IW staff talking all things pg) until he ended up as the sole target of intense pressure from Alefantis, his legal team, and the entire main stream media, for reasons which I have explained elsewhere in fine detail at Voat more times than should be necessary. Jones did precisely what he had to in order to keep Infowars and the important work it does viable, and not litigated into oblivion. Alefantis only needed to coerce an extraction from Jones as a proxy for all the other pg researchers and commentators, and he did this through several means that I would wager you're not even aware of.
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    Armchair quarterbacks like you do not have a flying clue of the actual details surrounding Jones's first - and likely last - retraction on precisely one individual. Jones has called out Clinton and Podesta for child sex things probably 10 times since the retraction, but none of his critics want to talk about that. Nor do you have a clue as to what it takes to run a media organization like his. Jones has an impeccable 22 year record of eviscerating the elites as the satanic pedophiles they are, and the only one who remotely rivals him in this department is indeed Davide Icke, but unfortunately, I have to inform you that Icke expressed potential skepticism about certain details surrounding the pizzagate narrative that are very much in keeping with Jones's position. Are you going to search out the video to which I refer, parse out Icke's words with the extreme precision which I have, and later submit your resignation of support for Icke for the same reason you have for Jones because David has sold out by your lofty standard? I think not, and for the very same reason Jones should be accorded some leeway on the one very narrow question of James Alefantis.
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    I've made a considerable effort to set the record straight, not that you're going to make the effort to verify this, but there are at least six posts going back months under my other username rwb that go into greater detail than I do here.

                      Icke didn’t have to, because Icke never spent weeks attacking CPP or Alefantis from the largest American alternative media news platform like Jones did to cause Alefantis to take action. And Alefantis was not just some creep no one knew anything about. Alefantis was named one of Washington’s 50 most powerful people.  Linger on that thought for a moment. Think of the thousands of senators, congressmen, judges, lawyers, generals, CEO’s and executives of companies like Boeing, Lockheed Martin, Raytheon, Northrop Grummen, United Technologies, BAE Systems, General Dynamics, etc., that all ranked
                      <strong>

                      than one James Alefantis, pizzamaker, but suspected Rothschild in the flesh according to good researchers here at Voat. Consider that Alefantis had the total and unwavering support of the planet's largest media behemoths which combined deliver 95% of the content everyone sees, hears, or reads. Consider that Alefantis and company went after Jones knowing that if they could extract a retraction from him and him alone, it would be the most powerful tool in their hands they could possibly hope for, thus eliminating the need to to try to take out the hundreds of other persons pushing pizzagate while simultaneously driving a wedge between Jones and his loyal followers. It was a brilliant plan, and it worked like charm. Consider that according to U.S. law, Jones had a finite window of time to make the retraction in order to insure Infowars would not be sued into the ground with unlimited money and resources and in a D.C. courtroom or rather the very nest of vipers, one probably run by a judge who is an
                      <em>
                       associate
                      </em>
                      of Alefantis, if you get my drift, and this window happened to be closing at the same time as the second and certainly not last of two pizzagate marches. Was Jones supposed to have the divine foresight to anticipate that by holding out on making a retraction as long as he could he would end up doing so about the time of the second march, and that this coincidence would be used as yet another tool against him? Do you really believe Jones sat around with all of his excellent reporters and journalists and said
                      <em>
                       O.K. boys, we're going to take one for the team and I'm going to apologize to suspected pedophile James Alefantis in order to help him in whatever way I can because I actually think he's a nice man after all, and want to do so at a time which will cause me and Infowars the most irreparable harm, so how about the day before the march?

                      So Titus Frost was livid. I would wager Frost despised Jones long before his retraction and probably wrung his hands in glee at the prospect of having something new to attack Jones with, like so many others. You're up to bat, daddy-o.

                       Alex Jones is a cowersly Zionist shill according to most alt media sources. Alex had never apologized to anything. Alex never broke pizzagate syory. He is a cointelpro shill. Alwas has been - Cooper was right all along. We may discuss this at another venue. We are trying to save children's lives - sadly we have to do it without dear Alex (Check out him fawning over Megyn - it's sickening)

                     William Cooper was exposing him back in 1999. Surly Bill Cooper is not a an 'arm chair quaterback' - and trust me I have more clue about global conspiracy than 10 Alex Jones' combined. I would shred him to bits. Check out Alex' podcast when a caller mentions Benjamin Freedman - Alex goes nuts and starts dropping the f-word. Let's face it  - Alex has sold out. If you want naked truth go to Alan Watt or Henry Makow (Alex used to have them on his show). Stop convincing yourself, it's toxic. No one was a bigger Alex Jones supporter than myself - but when I see him with Megyn Kelly ...... forget me, just go the podcast and see the comments. His fans are livid! Megyn Kelly - that narcissist bitch for heaven's sake. Take my advice - call everyone out and move on. Megyn Kelly!!!!! I thought I was seeing things!

                      Argument is over. Anyone silly enough to claim to know more about global conspiracy than 10 Jones's is nuts. You seem to forget that Jones has hosted perhaps 1000's of people over the years, people like Texxe Marrs, Jim Marrs, Mark Passio, Ted Gunderson, Jim Tucker, David Icke, etc., and all of them have contributed to Jones's world view of global conspiracy. I'd wager you've never had the benefit of speaking face to face with even one of the experts he's had on or was friends with for many years (like Tucker) let alone hundreds or thousands, but if I'm wrong, feel free to cite whomever you have. As far as Watt and Makow go, both have their own baggage. Do you know why Makow has a bee in his bonnet regarding Jones? Because Jones cut him off the air for swearing a decade ago, and Makow has made it his mission to destroy Jones ever since, regardless of any good work Infowars does. Jones cuts off anyone and everyone who swears. It's his show, which goes out on terrestrial radio where FCC rules dictate, so he was well within his right to not jeopardize his show for Makow. Bill Cooper also had baggage. Yes, he said many truthful things and certainly must be considered one of the fathers of the truth movement, and given the very strong personalities of Jones and Cooper and their close proximity, it's no surprise they clashed. Thus Cooper went on a mission to destroy Jones. Join the club Bill Cooper. I don't know what podcast or comments you are referring to, but if it's piles of uninformed readers like you, it does not persuade me in the slightest. One final point, if you can't even shred me to bits, how would you possibly take on Jones?
