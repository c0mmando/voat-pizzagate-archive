             Oh, I did not think of that.  Sure!  It is all from July 30th.
            </p>
            <p>
             Thomas Wictor says:
            </p>
            <p>
             (1) I spent ten years in Hollywood as a music journalist.
             <br/>
             (2) This was 1992 to 2002. Back then, print media was king. I worked for prestigious music magazines, so publicists courted me.
             <br/>
             (3) The publicists invited me to millions of parties, in the hopes that I'd be more likely to interview their musician clients.
             <br/>
             (4) I can't count the number of times that Hollywood producers, agents, directors, and actors asked me if I was a pedophile.
             <br/>
             (5) Here's what they always did: They told stories about places where adults had sex with children in front of audiences.
             <br/>
             (6) They asked me if I knew of any such places. When I said no, they'd ask if I wanted to GO to such a place.
             <br/>
             (7) I'd always ask if THEY went to such places, and they'd snicker and say yes.
             <br/>
             (8) When you went to their house, and they were going to show you something on their computer, illegal photos would pop up.
             <br/>
             (9) "Oh man! How'd THAT get there?" they'd ask. I never said anything or reported them to the cops. The cops were in on it.
             <br/>
             (10) You wouldn't believe how many celebrities get away with serious crimes in LA.
             <br/>
             (11) Lindsay Lohan committed a carjacking, a vehicular assault, a triple kidnapping, and a high-speed chase. It ended at a police station.
             <br/>
             (12) During the high-speed chase, her victims shouted at her to stop.
             <br/>
             (13) "I'm a celebrity," she said. "I can do whatever the eff I want." And she was right! No serious charges filed.
             <br/>
             (14) Hollywood's main problem is that the actresses will do ANYTHING to get parts. The men get jaded VERY quickly.
             <br/>
             (15) Gradually most powerful people turn to the ultimate sexual taboo. Why? They've done everything else.
             <br/>
             (16) It's 100 percent true that organized rings provide victims. Women usually head the rings. They can recruit more easily.
             <br/>
             (17) In Sacramento, female lobbyists have sex with politicians. It's how things are done.
             <br/>
             (18) In Hollywood, men prey on children of both genders. It's how things are done.
             <br/>
             (19) That may change. We may see a new unit of Untouchables take on these monsters. Wouldn't that be something?
            </p>
            <p>
             Question:  I'm sick to my stomach reading this. What can we do? Boycott the industry? What?
            </p>
            <p>
             Thomas Wictor responds:
            </p>
            <p>
             (1) Well, here's what I do: I don't watch films with children. A few years ago, Hollywood tried to mainstream this stuff.
             <br/>
             (2) At least four films DIRECTED BY WOMEN were released around the same time. Each shared the same premise:
             <br/>
             (3) Molesting female children turns them into women. All of the movies tanked, so it wasn't tried again.
             <br/>
             (4) The remake of War of the Worlds has several astonishing moments. The camera caresses Dakota Fanning from head to toe.
             <br/>
             (5) There's a basement scene that's especially egregious. Hollywood's always pushing, trying to get the public to accept this.
             <br/>
             (6) There's also a political aspect: If the age of consent is abolished, that's the end of the nuclear family.
             <br/>
             (7) Leftists hate the middle class, but they hate the nuclear family even more.
             <br/>
             (8) The nuclear family is the final defense against pure totalitarianism. To leftists, everything is political. Even child molestation.
            </p>
            <p>
             Someone posts the movie poster for Interview with the Vampire and asks "So I wasn't just misinterpreting things. I got nauseated watching this movie."
            </p>
            <p>
             Thomas Wictor responds:
            </p>
            <p>
             (1) YES! Kirsten Dunst became an overnight star because of that . Guess what they did to her?
             <br/>
             (2) Put her in Jumanji. Made her into a total sex object. Went on to "Fifteen and Pregnant."
             <br/>
             (3) From that point on, all that mattered was her body. When she was still a teenager, she was on the cover of a magazine.
             <br/>
             (4) White micro-shorts with a red cross on the crotch.
             <br/>
             (5) In Spider-Man, she wore gigantic falsies. This is all anybody cares about.
             <br/>
             (6) And it started when she was just a little kid.

            Anyone have a link to this guys credentials? Just wondering if his resume matches his claims. Im not familiar with him but, seems he should name those unnamed interviewees that were mentioned in his tweets. We are talking about child sex abuse here not drug use or something minor. Why is he waiting until now to talk?

             he said 'cops were in on it'.... what evidence do you really have--- hey cops, a guy said something crazy at a party-- think that would get very far? also prob drugs and such at a party, dissuading anyone involved in the party even further from involving LE.
             <br/>
             beyond that, after waiting years to use your conscience you lose what little cred you had at the time! plus California draconian statute of limitations on child abuse.... 
Feldman and Haim made it clear that people are scared into silence by lawsuits, blackmail and direct threats. 
the quiet drumbeat of truth continues... everybody get in the circle now and let's really TURN UP the BASS!!

              I want to make clear that I am not a cop hater. I think most of them go into it for the right reasons and there are some that are really good guys. But, in California, many sheriffs and police officers have been busted for exploiting underage hookers, seducing kids and possessing child porn. There have been some very serious scandals here lately. The good cops do not feel good about that.

              Everything you're saying is true but it reminds me of Scientology &amp; Leah Remini. My heroine, Leah. If enough people band together, if enough people with tape recorders in their pockets or hidden cameras band together, something COULD feasibly be done. It's easy for me to say though. I'm not an insider. The world needs more Leah Reminis.

               wholeheartedly agree with you!! scientology, as well as mormonism and catholicism, is increasingly facing the 'outing' of abuses hidden in their institutional closets!!
              </p>
              <p>
               surely we do not think that politicians, law enforcement, or entertainment moguls are somehow more moral that the leaders of the world's organized religions?? we will find these patterns again and again, power and abuse. stay woke-

              Not about predicting the future, this is just history repeating itself like it has done so many times before. Hollywood pedos groups have been a thing since as long as I can remember(80s) this is just more of the same.  Nothing came of the other times, nothing will come of this time, very sad.

                 Alternatively you could look at the worldwide backlash against paedophilia that surfaced around the time that pizzagate broke: Norway and Canada in November 2016, then the 2017 Australian MSM story about Westminster paedos, and the Australian move against paedophiles traveling abroad as well as numerous cases of child trafficking rings being busted in the U.S.

                  Well I hope your right but, I see a big distinction between some beaners getting busted trafficking kids and the entirety of hollywood being busted or even just some of the elite. Were talking about an organization that makes billions and employs millions.  They are like bankers, too big to fail.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  I firmly believe every actor, director, producer, in hollywood has to show they are one of them before they will ever get a part of note. Further more I believe there is a reason no actor in hollywood has normal children..

                   The point I'm trying to get to here is that conditions currently exist which could enable meaningful change to take place regarding predators in positions of power. Firstly there is the rise of nationalism in England with the rejection of the E.U. and then Trump's win on a platform of nationalism. This has resulted in an existential crisis for the E.U. with several of their member states pushing for autonomy. Nationalism is a case of large scale tribalism, and tribalism is a response to a hostile social environment. What we're seeing here is widespread recognition that deep problems exists within the current socio-political framework.

            So far, everyone is missing what may be the most key thing this gentleman shared. To paraphrase, it always works the same way. The initiates are brought to a location where a pedophilia performance is watched by an audience. To me, this is a very important detail and definitely not inconsistent with past testimony.

                When you say nsfw, is it because it's disturbing, or does it show a nude child? I've seen most of the worldcorp vids but only a blurry outline was shown. They were definitely heartbreaking, but still, no nudity. Also thanks for your reply.

                 you can see a bare child's chest- a boy- he has shorts on and possibly a bag over his head- standing in the shower and horrible screams of fear... a moving flashlight is the only light and camera is back a bit, but you can see enough to see what's happening. it makes all the other videos make sense.

                    I saw a post here awhile back that it was the work of some dude who just posts a bunch of random garbage. Some were saying it was all acting. If that's true, that kid definitely has a future in horror films. Those screams chill my blood.

                     that was before this video, i saw that post also, and do not think so. i believe the dude that post implicated is the guy from the chris chan youtube battle.... a guy who claimed to be chris chan in order to taunt the real chris chan (an austistic person who made a lot of videos). i watched the guy's (liquid chan) videos. no way. 
look, i watch a lot of weird stuff, horror movies, home videos, crime footage, etc.... 
my intuition is total realness here. if that kid is an actor, he's a very very good one and this would still be questionable for child abuse. 
who would do that?? multiple people and a child?? why?? study the random movements of the child and the man.... do they seem to be acting? if this is fake it's pretty high level horror material... why not spend your talents making movies for $$ instead of posting short clips on an anonymous barely known website?? 
a larp? what's the play? just an endless enjoyment to see people say, "this is horrible" and "can we help this child"? most people don't even watch the thing. what's the end game? why string it out so long? 
the simplest answer is the most likely right?
people are sadistic. kids are abused. 
i would like to see voice analysis on this like on the ramsey's 911 call!

              There's also Trumps little backflip over Clinton from "you would be in jail" (if he made the laws) to "we owe her a debt of gratitude". Still, Comey is on the list for investigation along with Clinton  in the recent House Judiciary Committee request, so it could be a case of him playing nice until he knows for sure that he's got the goods.

            Wow.  This guy is sitting on a powderkeg of incriminating evidence.  You can't blame him for not naming names, but if I were him, I don't think I could live with simply not watching films with children.  He says the police are in on it--true, I'm sure.  This is the big problem for anyone in his position:  Who to trust with your evidence?  We need to find a truly safe way for witnesses to come forward.
           </p>
           <p>
            By the way, what this guy is saying really rings true.  For instance, he says women run the child procuring operations.  This matches exactly the testimony of a Southern California victim who came forward on David Zublicks' You Tube channel.  Her story was discussed in this Voat thread:

             What evidence? Sounds anecdotal at best. Yeah he has some names of people who may have had incriminating things on their computers 15-25 years ago but it's an entirely different era of technology where you can download a VPN as easily as you can a web browser and infinitely more ways to cover your tracks for such things now exist which i'm sure are shared within such a circle. Unless there's something I missed.
             <strong>
              Edit: Not sure why all the downvotes but courts of law in the USA don't convict on a "he said, she said" basis it's just not how the judicial system works and never will. Kind of an issue with this problem is people get far too emotional and many completely throw logic and reasoning out the window.

              I don't know whether he has any physical evidence such as pictures, etc., but he definitely has eyewitness testimony of his interactions with potential perpetrators.  People told him they were doing illegal things with children.  They invited him to join in.

                Hang on wouldn't ole, def attempted to abduct someones word be he said she said? In fact don't we have 2 alleged victims and an eye witness accusing Trump?
