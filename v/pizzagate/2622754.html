<p>To those living outside the US and thinking it isn’t happening in your country — you would be wrong. It is everywhere!</p>
<p>One might wonder if there is any proof to back up my suspicions that American children were being killed and their organs were being trafficked back to countries such as Israel and China?</p>
<p>The United Nations Palermo Convention on human trafficking passed regulations related to human trafficking for organs. This UN agreement has been applied in prosecutions, for human trafficking in Brazil, South Africa, India, Moldova and other countries. The major purpose of the agreement was to prevent human traffickers, many of whom are surgeons, from “exploiting the bio-available bodies of immigrants, refugees, prisoners, the mentally deficient and others from being harvested while still alive”.</p>

<p>The Cleveland Clinic and UCLA? This leads any rational person to ask what the hell is going on? To those of you who have criticized me over your inability to believe that the elite are engaged in the widespread child sex trafficking, how would you explain away this evidence? If they will steal children’s kidneys, then why would they not traffic their bodies for sex?</p>

<p>CHILD\'S ORGANS STOLEN IN SPAIN</p>

<p>A toddler who died on holiday in Spain had every organ stripped from her body without her parents knowing. </p>
<p>Spanish pathologists who carried out a post mortem on two-year-old Megan Jones replaced them with padding. </p>
<p>Her parents found out the appalling truth only because they asked for a UK inquest when the little girl\'s body was returned home. Megan\'s mother Debbie Jones, 29, said: &quot;I will never recover from the shock of losing my beautiful daughter. But what they did to her afterwards was horrific.&quot; </p>
<p>Despite anguished phone calls and letters from the family, Spanish authorities are still holding some of Megan\'s organs, almost five months after she died from septicaemia following a severe infection. </p>
<p>The British Consulate is trying to get them returned. The case is far from an isolated incident, it emerged last night. In the past six months alone, four bodies have been returned from Spain with missing organs. The Foreign Office said the real figure is probably much higher, because most families do not demand a second inquest. </p>
<p>Megan had a slight cold when she flew to Tenerife in April with her mother, nine-year-old brother, aunt and two cousins.   A COLD?  She started out with a cold and her Organs Ended Up Missing.   THIS MUST STOP.</p>

            Don’t forget the syndicates that go around (Manila and the provinces ) who get women and children by force to sell their organs to other countries at a price ranging from P100,000-P500,000, depending on the kind of organ transplant needed.

             Its disgusting and immoral.  No one should have to sell any part of their body to feed themselves or their family.  This is global and if someone things it is not where they live, they are sadly mistaken.  Yes the Phil. is one of the worst.  Dutarte acts like a holy roller but he is part of it too. This is how they stay in power, for greed and election fraud.  They pay people to show up and cheer in crowds for their support.  Then some of them are possibly slaughtered.  This stuff can make you sick.  I have had to slow down today a little.

            And to help selecting the 'right' children for the right size, these logistics complicit members create national inventories of body part sizes, guised as healthcare provision software. I've worked at such company and discovered the software recorded body part sizes down to the centimeter. From this information, organ size can be calculated. The software also allows for mapping a client's network to a large extent. The body part sizes are totally unnecessary for the legitimate service provided or the clients. 0% added value for legitimate purpose. They provide 100% enablement for illicit, malevolent purpose.
           </p>
           <p>
            This helps the trafficker logistics to select victims from a national database based on the desired body part size, and an as small possible victim network so that disappearance of a victim is easier to mask.
           </p>
           <p>
            The employers at this company I worked for likely won't query the databases they host for county regions here in Holland, but they will 'teach' logistics complicit members on how to query county/town databases for suitable clients. When found, this information is then passed on within their network to an abduction unit which will take care of the abduction.
           </p>

            The satanic members employ women as seductive coercion units to get the software accepted by counties and cities, even if said county / city already has software from a competitor. The network behind the software of the company I worked for is intended to be a "nation wide rollout". It's sick. I advice to read the entire topic I posted, in the right order. It's so large that I had to split it up into multiple posts. I may actually turn it into a downloadable Word-document.

             This is frightening.  I gather you no longer work there.  I don't know how you can deal with all of this.  The posts we submitted were terribly upsetting for me to deal with, so your realizing what you were working with must have been earth shattering.  Has there been any response at all from Law Enforcement?  We know many are complicit and also involved so you are really putting yourself in danger by reporting them.  I have sent your info and links to a couple others.  Keep in touch please.  Peace.

              Thanks.. No I don't work there any more, however it's not much better where I work now. In fact, it's worse. Although that company doesn't create healthcare software; a lot of people that work there are members of the same cult. They speak of a guy named 'Rebbe' too, and call me a 'Merino'.

              I'll keep posted upon new development. I do know these Luciferians are attempting to conduct a 'confiscation mission' on me. They want food. Merino food.

               Yes, Please keep us posted.  And keep safe.  Are there no other jobs in your area?  It sounds pretty controlled, as if there may not be anything else.

            Per an article by Gene Emery for Scientific  American ( if my recollecting is accurate) , it is no longer necessary to have a complete match between kidney donor and kidney recipient. Recipients can live as long as 8 years with a mismatched kidney while waiting for a better match. If this holds true for kidneys and any other organs  the implications for organ trafficking are staggering.  Virtually any healthy human without AIDS of course  can be exploited or murdered for kidneys and maybe other organs.  I think its important for the crimes we research re: organ trafficking to have bioligical  viabilility.  After harvesting where , and how, do these organs  become transplanted given the challenges inherent in  preserving and matching and maintaining a transplanted organ.

           <p>
            We need to educate ourselves on this aspect because it is too hard for the unawakened person to believe this is really happening.  It is such a horrible crime that no sane person wants to believe it.  Its worse than SRA in my book where there is at least the chance to survive. My day is already ruined reading these several posts. Thanks to the posters for having the stomach to make these posts.

             I think research with the thymus gland of children may have something to do with this

             the gland peaks at age 14

               at the top right of article, you will see 3 vertical dots, click, you will see copy link
              </p>
              <p>
               I usually use goggle, pull up voat
              </p>
              <p>
               if you use the close all, all tabs will come up
              </p>
              <p>
               that way you can put link in voat
              </p>
              <p>
               to copy and paste, hold finger on text, when copy comes up, with finger on phone slide, lift, hit copy , come to voat and paste
              </p>
              <p>
               thats as far as I have gotten

               had to practice lol
              </p>

               I'd rather work on laptop, but that isnt an option at times
              </p>
              <p>
               other stuff that doesnt have that option, I tend to share in a message, lol she has been warned lol and then copy link from there
              </p>

             I along with you have log felt that we and our humans have been AWOL on the Organ Harvesting/Trafficking Market.  We have been Blind far too long.  YES!  People are totally sickened by this and so they refuse to believe it.  We must make sure to keep posting this and also to bring it up to friends and family, no matter how nuts they think we are.  YES!  They will think we are CTs.  So What.  I have been spreading the news slowly and will be sending these posts to a few people today.  Keep your info as private as possible.  Never opt in to Organ Donor Programs in your state.  They are automatically opting you in in some states, so YOU have to personally opt out or you are in it for life.  WAKE UP and WAKE UP OTHERS.

             A report on the Clinic and how they may be responsible for killing people under their care to use their organs.  When I read that Berlusconi is a member and had a heart transplant it was a HUGE Wake Up.  Hello!  These elites are having their ops done in high caliber hospitals, not in some back roads ambulance.  Leslie Wexner and his wife are deeply involved with Cleveland Clinic. Wexner has a huge Estate in UK.  This all connects somehow yes, with Organ Trafficking and Transplants.  Btw, I cannot get out of my head the number on that Grosvener Place.   33  Number 33.  I am also going to look at that EPIC Systems Inc.  in Wisconsin.
