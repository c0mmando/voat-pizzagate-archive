            I would ask Wendy if she's aware that Michael Alig is notoriously for being a 'chicken hawk' as far back as 1988 and if she's aware that giving Ernie Glam gifts of a wind up chicken toy and a skull ring as a gift probably a symbolic joke for pedos (Desmond gave the gift, I doubt he picked it out).  Also Ernie Glam gave Desmond his panda costume as a gift.  Is Wendy aware of the pedo symbolism of panda black eyes in within pedo circles?
           </p>
           <p>
            Is Wendy aware that Alig has lived his life (the parts out of prison) having his expenses paid (free apartments) by billionaire men, mainly not gay according to him.  That as far back as 1988 he and his boyfriend groomed straight or gay boys to party in drag, to get really to get hammered with free drinks and provide the environment where they often danced naked (for the enjoyment of adult paying customers), putting them at risk of having dangerous sex while under the influence of free drugs?
           </p>
           <p>
            Does she know that Alig and his boyfriend (after describing the grooming process) insinuated having gay sex with the boys, after giving them 'leftover Ecstasy? That they're express goal (beyond they're own enjoyment) was to build a customer base for the clubs (where organized crime could find profit via drug trafficking, and more likely then not prostitution?)
           </p>
           <p>
            Is she aware she's part of grooming her son for the enjoyment of pedophiles and that the drag lifestyle is a sexual fetish?

             oh she knows. I saw an interview and Desmond stated his mom was big fan of the Club Kids and Alig. They had a big book about it and would get makeup and costume ideas from it.

              If that's the case then it would be even more of a lead to find out who her dear gay uncle is, the one who 'opened up the (so called) gay lifestyle' to Desmond.
             </p>
             <p>
              On the one hand Wendy pushes Desmond as a gay rights advocate, but also says he's all about being a professional performance artist who performs drag and uses cash thrown at him (by gay men), to buy clothes and toys. She sees him as a gifted dancer (that remains to be seen) and a social influencer. (Who just so happens to mimick adults in speech and SJW points of view, promoting the misconception that anyone who questions the criticizes the obvious sexualization of children, is a hater).
             </p>
             <p>
              She said he's autistic, how will this play out for a kid who has been paraded and showered with accolades his entire life, based on looks in drag?  What happens when a new 'amazing' and fawned over kid is younger or cuter to the audience that has given him his stardom?  Will he understand that his phenom as a young 'Drag Kid' schtick won't be the same as a teen in drag?  No doubt those who have profited off of him understand child celebrity shelf life quite well and are looking forward to the new crop of kids 10 and under to follow in Desmond's footsteps.

            " If the question is too adult or kid-inappropriate Mom will answer"
Dressing in Drag and stripping in front of jeering men who throw dollar bills at you is kid-inappropriate "mom"... 
Now she's taking possession of the Mom persona as well?  That's MK Ultra.
           </p>
           <p>
            That kid is ruined for life by the way, If you thought Disney refugees fucked up when their sexuality kicks in and they realise they were raped injustly by pervert producers, imagine what this kid is going to be doing.  He's either a full blown fully fedlged satanic priest or he's the next serial cannibal killer..

             There's always the chance he discovers he's not gay after all, like he's been told and groomed for since birth.  If so, Mom better hide all the sharp objects in the house, and not leave his dad's brass knuckles or prescription drugs laying around. /s
