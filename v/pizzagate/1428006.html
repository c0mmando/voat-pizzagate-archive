<p>The true history has been buried. Churchill, Eisenhower, and DeGualle never mentioned the holocaust in the volumes in which they recounted WWII.

The Redcross report of 1948 mentioned the holocaust as a silly hoax (that\'s even a couple years after the war).  The holocaust and the evil of Nazi Germany was a lie, and we have been bred to hate the only people in history who have ever rebelled against this syndicate. I love Jews. Don\'t mistake my words for antisemitism. Jewish people are in no way to blame for any of our problems whatsoever. Hitler was absolutely wrong in this respect.
