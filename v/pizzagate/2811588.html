<p>This post takes us further down the rabbit-hole and looks at Free the Slaves, the organization that Katie Ford was first involved with after her UN invitation in 2008. You will find here that this organization also connects directly to the Clinton Global Initiative. </p>
<p><strong>Kevin Bales</strong></p>
<p>Kevin Bales is a co-founder of Free the Slaves, based in Washington DC, which is the sister organization of Anti-Slavery International, based in the UK. [23] Katie Ford became the Global Ambassador for Free the Slaves when she first got involved in anti-slavery activism in 2009. [9] </p>
<p>Kevin Bales, who is a Professor of Contemporary Slavery at the University of Nottingham, is well-established in the ‘anti-slavery industry’. He has co-written a number of books and has produced award-winning documentaries on modern slavery. He’s also credited with having edited an Anti-Human Trafficking Toolkit for the United Nations, so he’s obviously well-connected there. One of his books, titled Ending Slavery: How We Free Today’s Slaves, was endorsed by Bill Clinton at the plenary session of the Clinton Global Initiative, and he was even invited to join the planning of the Clinton Global Initiative. [23] BINGO!!!</p>
<p>So that puts this guy not only within the UN, but right in there with the Clintons when they were setting up one of their largest and most scandalous criminal enterprises. I haven’t explored this link any further yet, but it’s sure to prove very significant, so others might want to start digging. </p>
<p>Bales’ is also involved in setting up and maintaining a ‘Global Slavery Index’. I’m not sure what that is yet, but Bill Gates described it as an <em>“important tool to let governments, non-governmental organizations, and businesses take stock and take action against the terrible problem.”</em> [23] It must be good if a globalist like Bill Gates thinks so (not). </p>
<p>Bales also served as a consultant to the United Nations <em>Global Program on Trafficking of Human Beings</em>, and advised the US, British, Irish, Norwegian, and Nepali governments, as well as the governments of the Economic Community of West African States and the European Parliament, on the formulation of policy on slavery and human trafficking. [23] </p>
<p>Okay, so Kevin Bales operates at the highest levels, interfacing with governments and corporations. He’s the man we need to watch if anyone is. </p>
<p>A 2009 article about Kevin Bale and Free the Slaves exposes the fact that one of their projects in West Africa (called the International Cocoa Initiative) that was supposed to help children being used for slave labor in the chocolate industry, and which he touted as &quot;enormously successful&quot;, actually only benefited the chocolate companies and not the laborers. Bales’ was quoted as saying that* “instead of, say, attacking corporations and boycotting corporations,”* his group was* “bringing them into the mix and getting them to pay for the work on the ground.”* In this respect, $50 million was provided by these companies over a seven year period to improve the situation for the laborers, but an investigative team discovered that no improvements had been made and the laborers were living in squalid conditions. [22] Where did the money go? </p>
<p>Side Note: An article about Katie Ford from 2010 claimed that there were over 27 million slaves in the world. [11] A later article about Kevin Bales claimed that there were over 40 million slaves worldwide. [] If they are having a positive effect on world slavery, why is the number increasing dramatically? (This information needs to be verified.)</p>
<p>TO OTHER RESEARCHERS: I need help here. I don’t have access to the net 24/7, so I’m very limited in what I can get done. I need someone to start digging into the Free the Slaves non-profit organization to find their financial records, etc. Something to do with a “990”, according to the above links. I also need to find clearer connections between Kevin Bales and both the UN and CGI. Links to any information found is crucial for verification. </p>
<p>To help you dig up information on the people and organizations involved in these elite criminal networks, I suggest using these two excellent articles I found at Corey’s Digs as guides:</p>

            Their logo is a Freemasonic handshake for starters. Secondly, Katie Ford, daughter of Eileen Ford of Ford Models would know all about slave and child labor as her mother had underage girls living in her house in NY as up and coming models in the 80s and 90s. Beyond odd to say the least. The whole family is ass backwards. A lot of those same young 12 to 16 yr old models from way back then are pretty fucked up today. Wonder why.

This lab is where Monica spent a year ca 2014. Embrey funding allowed the spin-off. Polaris was criticized for not sorting out willing and unwilling prostitutes, I think!

             Blackstone-Backed GEMS Chooses London IPO Over Stake Sale
            </p>
            <p>
             GEMS Education is set to move ahead with an initial public offering, rebuffing interest from a private equity firm for a stake in the school operator backed by Blackstone Group LP, according to people with knowledge of the matter.
            </p>
            <p>
             The Dubai-based education provider may announce plans as early as this week to list in London, the people said, asking not to be identified because the matter is private. GEMS owners -- founder Sunny Varkey, Blackstone, Fajr Capital Ltd. and Bahrain’s Mumtalakat Holding Co. -- had been approached by a private equity company to buy a stake, they said.
            </p>
            <p>
             GEMS planned to hire investment banks including Bank of America Corp., Credit Suisse Group AG, JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. and Emirates NBD PJSC to manage the IPO, people familiar with the matter said in December. The company could be valued at about $4 billion or more, people said last year.....

            I found this article which contains more info on the Global Slavery Index. It indicates it was started in 2012 by Andrew Forrest with funding from Bill Gates. This article discusses how the index is based on flawed data:

             Yeah, I've since pulled up some info on the Global Slavery Index and have started looking at it. Apparently they are there to coordinate anti-slavery NGOs in order to oversee what they're all doing. Great way to police their own human trafficking networks and make sure no one upsets the cart.
