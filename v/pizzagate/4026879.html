<p>In this work, we focus on characterizing the QAnon movement on this http URL [Voat.co]. QAnon is a conspiracy theory that supports the idea that powerful politicians, aristocrats, and celebrities are closely engaged in a pedophile ring. At the same time, many governments are controlled by the &quot;puppet masters&quot; where the democratically elected officials serve as a fake showroom of democracy. Voat, a 5-year-old news aggregator, captured the interest of many journalists because of the often hateful content its users\' post. Hence, we collect data from seventeen QAnon related subverses to characterize the narrative around QAnon, detect the most prominent topics of discussion, and showcase how the different topics and terms used in QAnon related subverses are interconnected.</p>

<p>Notably, we relied on a word2vec model to illustrate the connection of different terms to closely related words. We found that the terms &quot;qanon&quot; and &quot;q&quot; are closely related to other conspiracy theories like &quot;pizzagate&quot;</p>
<p>Last we attempt to showcase how racist these communities tend to be, motivated by the slurs we detect in the word2vec model vocabulary and in the topic modeling we performed in Section 5.1. We now calculate the cosine similarity of the terms &quot;nigger,&quot; and &quot;jew.&quot;</p>
<p>By looking at Table 6, it is clear that the term &quot;nigger&quot; is associated with many hateful slurs like &quot;kike&quot; (a contemptuous term used to refer to a person of the Jewish religion or descent) &quot;faggot&quot; and &quot;filthy&quot;</p>
<p>As hypothesized, the term &quot;jew&quot; is closely related to words associated with the holocaust, and the terms &quot;masters,&quot; and &quot;puppet&quot; which suggests that indeed the users in these communities blame people of the Jewish religion or descent for corrupting their government, and leading the &quot;deep state&quot;</p>
<p>Alarmingly, we found that only one user authored about 30% of the total submissions posted in the most active subverse</p>

             Word2vec is a technique for natural language processing.The word2vec algorithm uses a neural network model to learn word associations from a large corpus of text. Once trained, such a model can detect synonymous words or suggest additional words for a partial sentence.wiki

             This model was trained on the Google News vocab, which you can import and play with. Contemplate, for a moment, that the Word2vec algorithm has never been taught a single rule of English syntax. It knows nothing about the world, and is unassociated with any rules-based symbolic logic or knowledge graph. And yet it learns more, in a flexible and automated fashion, than most knowledge graphs will learn after many years of human labor. It comes to the Google News documents as a blank slate, and by the end of training, it can compute complex analogies that mean something to humans.
            </p>
            <p>
             You can also query a Word2vec model for other assocations. Not everything has to be two analogies that mirror each other.

            <p>
             Word2vec is a method of computing vector representations of words introduced by a team of researchers at Google led by Tomas Mikolov. Google hosts an open-source version of Word2vec released under an Apache 2.0 license. In 2014, Mikolov left Google for Facebook, and in May 2015, Google was granted a patent for the method, which does not abrogate the Apache license under which it has been released.

             That paper is so flawed. They are just computing how many times particular 'hate speech' words are said in these forums.  Not looking at the context or the user accounts .. They completely ignore the strong research community and describe voat as a news aggregator only.  They don't look at the percentage of accounts that actually indulge in the practise, or look at what are the most used words or terms.  It's just a hit piece and hardly a 'scientific' paper.

              Generalizations. Over-simplification. Demarcating single interpretations for words which may have multiple meanings. Associating stereotypes. Misguided certainty. Dismissive of different opinions. Associating separate beliefs.

              A real researcher would understand that VOAT is just a microcosm of the rest of the world, and besides MOST being concerned with FREEDOM OF SPEECH and SEEKING THE TRUTH, we have all kinds. If we were to discriminate based off of the opinions and words that we disagree with or make us uncomfortable, we would ignore the fact that those ideas exist and never confront them in this relatively safe space. Censorship doesn't eliminate anything. It ignores an individuals concern until that individual feels so "unheard" that they must use a different "forum" to express it. This is the danger they are perpetuating with this thought control PC madness, IGNORANCE, and EXTREMES.
             </p>

              THANKS "SCIENTISTS". How about you put some effort into investigate this phenomena like a real human - like most of our users have -  so you can see its not so BINARY?

               Well I'm too lazy to sift through the drama but some people claimed to have ip access and Gotham girl was just posting about it.

               was collecting ips and banned him but he showed how everyone's passwords are already out on the Internet ip is irrelevant just need username or email address.
              </p>
              <p>
               Then he proved it further by leaking passwords of wuhan institute of virology and the world health organization. The passwords were proven to be working and material was acquired from the accounts. There was a story in the Washington post about it.
              </p>

               As far as I know he proved

               was a shill working for QinetiQ a British defense contractor and that was the real reason for the banning. Or somebody with the password goatfucker. One of the mods.

                So what do you think is the reason for an organisation like QinetiQ to set up a place like this? Honeytrap is the obvious answer.  But what, in your opinion, is the long game?

                 , who claims to be pro pizzagate, has done nothing of the sort and is mostly focused on censoring people and insulting them. He has a lot less power and attention after his shill cohorts were exposed. This is why he hates "doxxers". Doxxing destroys pedophiles and shills.

             It really should come as no shock that a media entity removes all context and merely labels a subsect of Voat as hateful based on the hateful rhetoric af

            <p>
             If they included context, they would plainly see that it isn't QAnons who are the racists. Hateful though they are in some respects, the article blatantly ignores all context for the sake of pushing a narrative which is incidentally in favor of those who seek harm on QAnons. Again though, is anything else really to be expected from any media entity anywhere?

             Yes, this wing of the infowar anti-pizzagate operation has been obvious since the Reddit migration in November 2016. It's pretty obvious to me that the whole point of the Reddit shutdown was to force the migration to Voat so that our research could be discredited and dismissed as extremist hate speech. The very first mod team here attempted to ban it, which triggered the Voat immune system and got them all demodded.
            </p>
            <p>
             Ironically, what ended up happening is that Voat's radical free-speech atmosphere ended up both truly invigorating research (waking up a lot of anti-child-trafficking normies to the role of Satanic Freemasons and Marxists in the Cabal) and toughening them to information warfare.
            </p>
            <p>
             The academic researchers of this study make a giant error. They dismiss the hate speech subs as having no content worthy of consideration, when in fact they contain a lot of suppressed data and history from post-WWI and WWII which, when known, completely exposes the globalist Cabal and it's agenda.

            The stuff in these links suggest a plot by “them” to try to get voat taken down.

                 The Atlantic -&gt; Travis View (big anti pizzagate shill), Mike Rothschild and Fredrick Brennan (former owner of 8chan, pedophile, cyber criminal). The later one is very big into deplatforming and more importantly, doxxing people then inciting people to cause as much offline harm to them as possible.

                  showed up here at the end of October 2017 and DMed me to find out how to make a non-rule-breaking submission about "Breadcrumbs anon" who later designated himself "Q Clearance Patriot" aka QAnon, (which was odd in itself, since most new people are oblivious to our submission rules), one of the strangest things he said was "Keep doing what you're doing. It's having a much bigger impact than you know. People at high levels watch this board."

                  There is zero doubt in my mind that the opposition to us is highly organized. Many good moderators here have been doxxed and run off Voat --

                   @PleadingtheYiff

                  </a>
                  , who were doxxed right after the Reddit migration,
                  <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/u/abortionburger">
                   @abortionburger
                  </a>

                   v/pizzagate

                  and went on to create the main target of this research,

                   v/GreatAwakening

                  and was then doxxed and forced off Voat entirely.

                  GA is still going strong, which makes this "research study" all the more gratifying.

                 <p>
                  As a longtime observer and researcher into the shills behind those doxxing efforts, I can tell you they all share two things in common: hatred of Trump and/or QAnon. Most of them also espoused "concern" for child victims to justify their actions. The operation to take down srayzie exposed the true nature of numerous well-camouflaged shills, including the most powerful account on Voat,
                  <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/u/Kevdude">

                 <p>
                  None of the pizzagate mods, by the way, faced any real life trouble after they left Voat.  It was all hot air.

                    To my knowledge, only a few non-mod members of this board have been doxed.

                    , and they were left alone as soon as they stopped researching and posting here, just like the mods who were doxed. Several others doxed themselves and switched accounts but faced no RL consequences.
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    Only two people have come to harm that I know of: Kappy, who was never a subscriber here to my knowledge, and Jenny Moore, whose RL identity was not known during her time on this board.

                          You seem tormented seek PRAYER
                         </p>
                         <p>
                          When you are facing the anguish of spiritual battles the mind is often in torment. I understand. Right now, take 3 long deep breaths. Quiet your mind. Breathe in God’s love and peace, breathe out fear and anxiety. I encourage you to say this short prayer out loud on a daily basis. At any moment during the day if you feel that anxiety rising, pull out this prayer and say it again. Blessings.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                          “Dear Lord, I come to you broken, tired and dejected. I am weary of fighting these battles. I now relinquish control over my situation. I now give you control over my family, my work, my marriage and Goat interactions. In the name of Jesus I now command fear, worry, anxiety and every thought that is not of God to leave my mind. I now choose to walk in the perfect peace that God desires for my life. I now choose to trust that God is at work in my life and in all my situations. I submit my mind, will and emotions to the Lord Jesus Christ. God’s perfect love is a barrier around me and all that I have therefore I refuse to come under fear but choose to walk in faith. I remind myself that each day is a new beginning and I now choose to rejoice in God’s goodness. I command my emotions to be steady and stable all day long. Today I will walk by faith knowing that God loves me and has the best for me.    In Jesus name.    amen

                         I don't know what zb was saying, or wanting. Because I tried to stay as far out of it as I could. I think they're all insane......yep, pretty sure at this point.

                         I know you're always too busy looking at the fatty-boobs to pay attention to anything else, but if you look in the eyes of both, their madness isn't hidden. One has crazy eyes, the other has dead, soulless eyes. Both disgusting, both mentally ill, tatoos, layers of paint. Both look 10 yrs older than they are. Both whores. Both Doxxers.  Who'd a thunk it? They could be twins, to anyone who doesn't have a dog in their fight.

                                   , and their fams. The only thing that i can see proven about GG is she's a whore who got involved with a drunken, criminal, meth head, and she lies, a lot. Stupid Pet Dragons, tend to do that. Prolly drank too much Kool-aid.

                                         are in her family. Why wouldn't we do an investigation? She wanted to be a public figure, she should be treated like one. Her IRL doxx reveled that she was a person of extremely low character, and came from criminals and 'she said' pedos. Was she lying, or telling the truth? The doxx didn't lie.

                                          Your public call to investigate the criminal family members of a survivor who was doxxed here, whose identity is easy to deduce from your Comment history and which could easily lead those individuals to harm the survivor in question, is a clear example of inciting harm. You should be ashamed.

                That's the best you've got? I've done you no harm, ever. Why is it bad to think the enemy of my enemy, isn't my friend? Especially when they have labelled us 'pizzagate' to begin with. And now try to label us as qtards. "Just another bunch of right winged wackos." "Nothing to see here folks."

           <blockquote>
            <p>
             Grossberg’s lecture series at MIT Lincoln Laboratory triggered the national DARPA Neural Network Study in 1987-88, which led to heightened government interest in neural network research. He was General Chairman of the first IEEE International Conference on Neural Networks (ICNN) in 1987 and played a key role in organizing the first INNS annual meeting in 1988, whose fusion in 1989 led to the International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN), which remains the largest annual meeting devoted to neural network research. Grossberg has also organized and chaired the annual International Conference on Cognitive and Neural Systems (ICCNS) since 1997, as well as many other conferences in the neural networks field

            I propose we watch them too. Following the authors of the paper leads to a number of cyber labs.. maybe they are not aware of the networks they are connected to.. because I can tell you now ..

                        There you go accusing me of being a lady. Ladies sit still while there country goes up in flames. Women don't. You wouldn't know about such things, being from a country that has no women.

                       <p>
                        Why you worried about who I give fyi pings to? They're more likely to downvote me than you, if they're your friends.
                       </p>
                       <p>
                        If any of them tells me to stop pinging them, I will. They haven't yet. maybe i'm entertaining them? idk.
                       </p>
                       <p>
                        You seem nervous. Would you like it better if I secret pinged them, instead? I'll do that, since you're so sensitive.

              This research is an early step toward understanding how disinformation campaigns use images. Our research provides a look at the past, but from what we have learned, we expect that information warriors will create more content themselves, and take advantage of material others create, to improve their strategies and effectiveness.

              As the 2020 presidential election approaches, Americans should remain aware that Russians and others are continuing their increasingly sophisticated efforts to mislead, confuse and spread social discord in the public.

', "When he died in 1911, Galton endowed UCL with his personal collection of archives, and a bequest which funded the country's first professorial Chair of Eugenics."
