<p>I was looking for clues in Jimmy Comets Instagram posts/pics saved on my system. The &quot;Eyes Wide Shut&quot; type pic has a comment by Alefantis.. &quot;Love E. BRADY ROBINSON.&quot;

I didn\'t really find much in her photos, but a few seemed weird. Then I came across this pic she took of the desktop of Clampart...look at bottom right, zoom in..
<a href="https://i.sli.mg/N6bb65.jpg">https://i.sli.mg/N6bb65.jpg</a>
Now I knew she is involved to a degree. I believe she is a photographer for the cult. Above pic is on her site <a href="http://www.ebradyrobinson.com/artdesks/">http://www.ebradyrobinson.com/artdesks/</a></p>
<p>So, my search went on. I Google image searched E. BRADY ROBINSON ALEFANTIS, and to my amazement found this very revealing Twitter post from 3 years ago!

Holy crap! See the comment? See the school bus?! An employee of Alefantis\' Transformer gallery posted that suggesting his affinity for children! A photo of Alefantis up for auction at the Transformer Gallery! Not only is it hash tagged #transformerdc, &amp; also still found on transformers twitter account, but it\'s liked by 2 people..one of them E. BRADY ROBINSON! Found in plain site. Hurry because it will probably get deleted now that its in the light! My only ? is who would buy his pic at auction...lol</p>

            Seems like a stretch.  She could easily just be saying "Is this portrait here just to be silly?"  People rarely use "ironic" in a literal sense; usually it just means "funny" or "goofy."  Possible that she was implying what you suggest, but this isn't evidence of anything by a longshot.

            That sure is some weird art.  I spent some time looking at the post-it notes.  Creepy!  Seems to me there are hidden meanings in there.  One of them has what looks like a ladies head with miniature in her mouth.  There was also a picture of 2 children eating something gross but I only have an ipad mini so I can't see it well.

            I think this is interesting.
           </p>
           <p>
            I get the irony - some in comments here don't seem to understand the "joke".  No it doesn't prove anything, but it does add to the picture of DC "trafficking culture" as casually accepted by associates of JA.
           </p>
           <p>
            And what is with that weird ritual picture?  I'd like a full explanation from the person who took it, and more importantly, from the children pictured.  Did they consent to this? Did their parents?  Who are these people.

            I also dont see anything suggesting Alefantis is selling children in the post. A shot of him next to a bus is not proof. Dont look too hard into this one folks.

             It is what it is on the surface. An employee took a pic of his pic on the wall at an auction at Transformer. He posted that pic on Twitter stating that it's "IRONIC." I merely point out what he could mean. I first thought he meant the pic of the school bus next to James, but then thought about the angle of selling as some have mentioned here. Either way or both, the pic &amp; the comment are suggestive at what we are investigating. I'm just contributing to the board with what i found hoping to find more evidence with everybody's help.

            So wait  second, was that first pic ever explained? Because I've seen it multiple times before but only now did it truly start to creep me out. Where are they? It looks like some sort of shrine and the 3 people in masks and weird dresses/skirts. Did Alefantis take the photo?

             I'm not sure who took the pic but it seems Alefantis did. He posted it. If you zoom into the bottom black frame you'll see the pic is of a pic displayed on an insignia tv/monitor...

              Ooh I see. I wonder if anyone has identified what this is from, like is it from a movie or could it be from something more nefarious... It looks like some real sketchy, occult shit.

            Is it ironic because james alefantis is usually the one putting others up for auction? That's my interpretation. How does it show his affinity for children?

             Someone correct me if I'm wrong, but I think the idea is that a picture of JA up for auction would be ironic because he auctions off children?

             It's not what I'm saying, but yes, it went up for auction 3 years ago at transformer gallery where Alefantis is board president.
