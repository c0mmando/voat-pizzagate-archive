            Hey, sorry for the late reply. I'm applying to PA School this May and my original plan was (like you said) start out in primary care and than maybe move to EM once I got some experience. Or stay in primary care if I like it. From my understanding, primary care in America is a pretty broken system (I've heard its better in Canada) so I'll see how I like it. And I look forward to any update you get from your prof! Thanks for your help!

            I am glad you have gained some release at least from social norms such as the trappings of success.  This shock is a maturing of the soul in many ways.   thank you for answering me and my best wishes on your path.

             I found out that all hospitals in the country have to put up these signs, that it is an actual law since 2015  or something. I was surprised because this is the first time I ever saw a sign l like this, and it was almost like a sign from God that what we're all doing is actually worth something.

            were you on the thread when it was taken down?  I was wondering if the story about them finding a place on the CPP website they were trying to hack into was true?  What was the breakdown like?  PG never hit me that really hard because I knew for about 10 years the trafficking was big and going on including places like Disneyland, etc,

            so this was more like ok, we are honing in on it, getting some mechanics of how it works, etc..   So I am curious about how it feels when one's world view suddenly breaks into pieces like that.  thx.

            I'm going into medicine after college and I'm torn between doing ER and primary care. In your opinion, which specialty comes across more trafficking victims? This won't be the only factor deciding what I choose but I am interested. I read some study awhile ago where it said 85% of trafficking victims will come across a medical professional during there time as a victim yet most medical personnel won't notice. Just wanna do my part in helping :)

            I get it. These people are so sick that it is hard to process and makes me feel incredibly angry since it appears to real yet is being given cover.

            Sorry to hear your pain and frustration. But turn it into good! I was the first person in my circle to hear about PizzaGate, but I introduced the topic by emailing friends and acquaintances the most compelling evidence. The pictures put out on Instagram by Jimmy Comet are the most incriminating.

            </a>
            Also there are videos of Ted Gunderson, a former FBI director that expose the real facts on Pedophilia. Also former NYPD Pedophilia Expert Jim Rothenstein has spoken out in several recent interviews.

            </a>
            Then we have a former high level intelligence expert Dr Steve Pieczenik exposing PizzaGate right before the election.

            Speak out with facts that cannot be refuted. I know it can be frustrating. I am married to someone who doesn't want to believe. He told me to stop listening to such allegations. I got angry and gave him my two cents worth at the time and then I began to gather the evidence and share it. Most cannot deny something is going on once they have opened their minds. Try to find Facebook support groups or people on Twitter who are exposing PizzaGate!

            OMG your story is really something - your therapist became your depressed friend?  its like a movie.
           </p>
           <p>
            You know what, keep your sense of humor, it will get you through.  And maybe you should write it out - like a short film with pizzagate info and all the crazy stuff -the bathroom stuff is ridiculous.  Take up a project of some kind anyway, something creative.  You'll get through.
           </p>
           <p>
            And take heart.  Yes the world is not what we thought it was, people are not what we thought they were, but life is an amazing gift.  Be grateful every day.  It is a privilege to be alive, and to be intelligent - and awake!  You have a friend at least who knows the truth too  - that is more than a lot of people have.
           </p>
           <p>
            And read this book.  it is NOT about religion, it's something else, and meticulously researched by a therapist.

            As a German, only few people around me have even heard of it. I have managed to redpill most of my friends and some people at Uni. Funnily, I'm also friends on facebook with a doctor and she is actively researching pizzagate as well. The problem is that these 'more credible' people can't speak out publicly about it without risking losing their job.

            This is the kind of reasons of why I really wish we had some type of "logo". Not some obvious, stupid, cheesy looking (ugh puns in bad taste, I know I know...) thing like a picture of a pizza. But some kind of subtle, obscure enough logo that would still make people curious to look up what the hell it means once they notice people leaving stickers / drawings / etc. of it all of the place randomly. Curious enough that they'll look it up, possibly spark something inside to make them open their eyes and wake up to the disturbing reality of the world and hopefully then join the rest of us who are "awake". We need to do everything we can to get others to WAKE UP - and something so subtle as a simple "logo" could potentially be the small, seemingly insignificant thing that ends up sparking many people to open their eyes.
           </p>
           <p>
           </p>
           <p>
            Not only that, but having something like that - and seeing random strangers with the "logo" gives that amazingly feeling - I'm sure many of you know what
            <em>
             that
            </em>
            feeling is. That same feeling when you see a stranger who's wearing / has something displaying your favorite band logo, or a logo / symbol related to a fandom you really love, or whatever it is - it's one of the best feelings in the world to instantly feel connected to a total stranger and share that moment of mutual understanding.

            PizzaGate in reality is one of the most disturbing, horrific truths of the world - despite the fact that we've barely scratched the surface of uncovering the true evils that exist. Yet - on the complete opposite end of the spectrum - it's something that has caused many people to
            <strong>
             wake up
            </strong>
            . We all share the same will and avid devotion to open people's eyes be the change of good that has been needed for tens, of hundreds of years to expose the true evil, lies and deception that everyone has become blind, mindless slaves to.

             I'm sorry for doing that! I know for myself that I do my research while my kids are asleep more often than not, and have fell off track for a short while because I'd been sick, I had a really bad experience at Church a few weeks ago, and now one of my children broke a bone. It was just astounding to me that all the work we've been doing finally seems to be going somewhere, that we're getting somewhere, because I know my story about researching can't be much more off than plenty of people on here. I'm just really hoping that now that Trump is in office that we'll finally pick up some steam and get somewhere.

            Take heart! You see the evil. The ones who can't or won't see it are doomed. It's always darkest before the dawn. Justice and retribution is coming, but not merely from man.

            Thank you so much for posting that. I only know one person I can talk to about this stuff-- the person who first told me about PG and now, thanks to you guys, I'm the one keeping HIM in the loop. My friends and family are all awkward silence around me with this stuff. I know at least a few read some of what I post about PG on social media but nobody comments or acknowledges. So then I start doubting it but then I remember all the stuff discovered by the Voat Investigators and I come back here, like it's a refuge for my soul.

            I don't know if you believe in God, but you're a physician that cares about pizzagate so you're certainly on the right path... but search "Mark Taylor prophecies".
           </p>
           <p>
            I was in a pretty dark place after searching all of this but then I discovered those prophecies and got a fire in me.
           </p>
           <p>
            Gods hand is at play now. We're in the first rounds of THE final fight and I know who wins in advance.

            Holy shit balls. That they've rescued kids is astounding. The docs and nurses need to do a write-up on lessons learned and SOP for pulling that sort of thing off successfully.

            Have conviction. Have faith. Do not allow others or the devil himself to try to take you off course through rejection of you socially. Personally I am made like Trump. I say what I think and am happy to accept the consequences and defend what I believe, no matter the social pressure to conform. Nowadays I just drop bombs in conversations about this and don't blink. For instance, today someone brought up "oh they won't prosecute HRC"... I said "Well I seriously doubt that bc not only would they be allowing a treasonous traitor off the hook for selling state secrets to our enemies, but they'd also be allowing a known human and child trafficker and murderer off the hook. I don't see that happening..." Crickets. MFing crickets. And then the questions come and I get to fill them in on the bullet we just missed.

            You're not alone. If this helps, a LOT of Americans had been feeling the same way, and that is EXACTLY why DJT is President. Your stupid, globalist, prostitue, CIA plant, PM will be voted out in the same way. The globalist push to shove these insane "values" down our throat is in the middle of blowing the fuck up. Evil always outs itself. 
Stay strong and positive. Be the light in the darkness. We CAN make a difference.

            This is great news.   I begin the subject by sharing some examples about mainstream broadcasting fakery. 
When they realize it can't be trusted then I ask them if it were true would they care about the welfare of children?
I  invite them to do their own research on the various fake  news broadcasts,  provide  the wikipizzagate  and a few website and the video primer, Kinsey history, Franklin Scandal history,  project flicker history references and if they care about the welfare of children they'll research it.   If they have a soul and a brain it'll click.
            <br/>
            If they don't, then they're mouth breather wastes of my time. 
then their part of the problem and not part of the solution.

            Kids are being sacrificed to benefit the powerful. If they ARE involved, they should be very scared that you know. Fuck them. I just pray for protection for everyone who's knee deep in this and am confident we are on the right side of His protection.

             I'll see if I can find it.  This is a neighboring state for me and the sign is very similar but it was smaller and had 5 languages on it. They were English, Spanish, Arabic, Chinese and what looked like Russian.

            I can also relate to many of these comments. I live in a big liberal city and work in media, surrounded by many Hillary supporters. I get blank stares and ‘that’s crazy’ when talking about any number of topics including pizzagate or other Cabal crimes... I was myself, a liberal, twice a Obama voter until I had a huge awakening to many things in this world. I now realize how hollow those labels are... I knew as soon as pizzagate emerged that it was true, and how we haven’t truly seen how dark it is… I know because my mom was a victim of satanic ritual abuse as a child, and she was witness to the worst things imaginable. Hundreds of rapes, torture, murder of other children and adults, and many satanic rituals. There are a few stories on youtube that are comparable, but mostly people could not believe it. And as others have said here, most don't want to hear it because it makes them uncomfortable.
           </p>
           <p>
            I know exactly what kind of people the Podestas, Alefantis, Hillary, Soros and so many more are. They know that we know. And they are very worried…The world is on the verge of a great awakening, and pizzagate is one of the many catalysts allowing this to happen. We must not give up until they are exposed and stop them from hurting anyone ever again. Never stop.

            Turns out that a guy I work with us just as interested as I am. I wouldn't call is researchers but we are certainly followers. We research the info the actual researchers put out just to make sure we aren't being fed false information but that's the extent. We discuss it every day.

             actaully, if you could put up your conclusions once a week or so, that would be very helpful here - I'd love to know what catches both of your attentions to talk about.   Have you ever disagreed on a pg topic?  what do youdiscuss the most?

              No, we have yet to disagree. We both believe something is going on. We don't want to. See don't want it to be real. We both have small children and it makes us physically sick.
             </p>
             <p>
              We discuss everything. He introduced me to to Ben Swann and I showed him Mr. Webb. Usually we agree if something is legit. On the few times we haven't, we both investigate and come to an agreement either way.
             </p>
             <p>
              Edit: we are both trump supporters but are keeping a watchful eye on him. We hope he does well but don't hold ore breath.
             </p>
             <p>
              Edit #2: I'll talk to him about sharing some of our stuff on here.

            That's so encouraging. I bet there are quiet researchers all over the place! A doctor and nurse is a great profession to spot these things.

            I really do think there are many who know what is going on on the other side of the curtain. Just a little aside....do any of hall remember when the two Virginia Tech students murdered the young girl, after the boy lured her out of her house with making her think he wanted to,be her boyfriend? I think it happened in Fall of 2015.  Because of where I work (a church) I have to take classes about appropriate  behavior with people, especially children. In doing a little research and looking at this case, the boy's in stag ram came up and look and behold, his friends kept saying "I love cheese pizza."  At the time,before wikileaks, I thought they were just talking about late night munchies.   Can you imagine the sick feeling I got when the dots were connected and I was redpilled?  This is definitely the medical industry knows what is going on. I feel so badly for them knowing it is really going to  take a lot more patience to see this all come to an effective conclusion.  That little girl those Tech students killed was 13.  They treated her like garbage and killed the poor little thing.  This is one we do know about.....this did happen and the Virginia  State Police found her body and arrested those two pos's that did this. So, again, many know, but there are many who are very frightened of people like killery.

            Be really careful and scope people out and get to know them before you say something that may put you in danger.  Do not tell strangers that you mention PG to if you have children or where you live, etc.  Keep Yourself Safe.

            Two nights ago, after the Ben Swann thing, I went on twitter to thank him. There in the comments was a girl I had known through Facebook for years, but had never spoken to.
           </p>
           <p>
            After I called Ben the fucking man, I went on fb and messaged the girl, telling her it was cool to see acquaintances involved in PizzaGate. She messaged back a few minutes later, and we had a great conversation.
           </p>
           <p>
            P.s. Did I mention she's super hot? :P

            I'm so happy I read this.  And yet, on such an auspicious day.  It make me feel like God is looking down on us.  We all know that Pizzagate is real.  I've had all of the same thoughts and feelings.
           </p>
           <p>
            We just watched Trump vaporize Obamacare with the stroke of a pen on live TV.  We know Flynn knows about Pizzagate.  Trump knows too and is focused.  Sessions is locked and loaded.
           </p>
           <p>
            I'm not religious, but I am spiritual.  I honestly believe that this may be a sign from God that he sent someone to those that believe who is going to finally shed light on our country.
           </p>
           <p>
            May God protect Donald Trump and those he surrounds himself with.

             I will tell you that you are spiritual because God created you that way.  He is seeking your love.  You have a lot of closeness with God because He is calling you to grow in Him.

            That's awesome and great that there are Dr.s and nurses out there aware of pizza gate . "They" make it sound like the only people researching it are conspiracy theorist living in their Moms basement.

             I know of several medical professionals who are aware and they do not know of each other. They have no relationship with each other.  Pizzagate I think has more notoriety than we realize . That FBI document would be a great tool to raise awareness.

            Last night I was explaining to three black college students from Sierra Leone.  Being from a country with a long history of human trafficking it wasn't nearly as difficult to convince them as it was awkward to ignore all the idiots (most of them likely CTR pedophiles themselves) casually throwing the word "nigger" around.

             Apparently these things have gone on in Africa  for a long time.

             I'm not sure some of the low-life peons are involved in that level, because their  peons could be pure sales  and/or  sex   and/or torture,   but on the higher upper echelons there seems to be common threads  that make the entire  Abramovic cannibal blood crap legit.

              It's the optics that gets us so confused. Look at today. The media portrays a KNOWN rapist and "suspected" (by the MSM via Lolita express, at least) ex President being portrayed as "honorable" for showing up to the Inauguration. It makes it hard to connect that image to one of him and his wife being absolute living Devils. So for most there is a cognitive dissonance that is hard to break through without video evidence. In the countries within the third world this behavior is known. It's part of their general lexicon. So our challenge is getting Americans to understand it's not just in the third world.

            Upvoat, for the title alone. Now every time I go out, I consider myself a "pizzagate researcher in the wild," and get the notion to peek around corners. ;) Great stuff, including comments.

             I got the name actually from a couple groups I have of wearing my kids in slings and babywearers like Ergobaby and Tula. There is this thing that if you see another mom wearing their baby in a Tula or LilleBaby brand babywearer that you holler out Tula or Lille and then the other person will reply back, In the wild Oy Oy Oy!

             Oh yeah, thanks, he's actually pretty resilient, and is bouncing back from breaking his bone already. Didn't have to put a cast on him luckily, he is just wearing a sling, and some light pain meds, tylenol mostly.

            Awesome. I learned of the issue through a neighbor. I was skeptical but curious. An openness to the truth, even if ugly and conflicting with your views on certain things, is critical to becoming informed and truly red-pilled (a new phrase for me in mid November). The most important thing is for people to understand that this is about saving children, regardless of the political impact or its affect on your world view. #SaveTheKids

              Yeah. My comment sure deserved a downvoat. I wonder if it was this pedo creep that I encountered today (
              <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/user/wonderpig">
               @wonderpig
              </a>
              ). I am pasting below the comment he made, to which I replied that he must be a pedo:
             </p>
             <blockquote>
              <p>
               Actually that tragedy was caused by laws against pedophilia. If consensual pedophilia were legal (with parents consent) then unstable adults would not snap and resort to crime. They would have no reason to kidnap or kill kids to hide the evidence. That's why Dutroux could not reveal where the kids were. That's why the kids died. This is how sick societies create their own problems.

            My cousin knew about it, we skimmed the surface for a minute, his kids (military) know about it (more than him). I gave him some missing pieces, he was quite interested. More of them in the Trump camp I guess.

            My friends are, for the most part, Democrats. I was treated to the sound of minds snapping shut when I broached the topic. Several actually said they preferred not to listen to anything that did not make them feel good. That is something I realized, that many people live in a fantasy world they have created to feel comfortable in, and anything that threatens that world is simply not looked at, and is shut out. Several repeated the 'fake news' mantra.

             If/when audio and visual evidence comes out from this and MAJOR names are implicated, billions of humans across the globe will be faced with a reality so dark that it will cause many of them to snap. Like people getting their luggage on a plane about to crash.
            </p>
            <p>
             The ill prepared mind will recoil in horror and simply shut off. Probably similar to what happens to these poor kids when their personalities shatter.
            </p>
            <p>
             Furthermore, those who have any semblance of faith will be better prepared mentally and spiritually for the revelations to come because absolute Good necessitates absolute Evil... and there could be no other source of what we're seeing here. I predict the reality is worse in both scope and severity. God knows. This will be a test of faith for the world.

             Be painfully considerate with close friends and family. Consider your sphere of influence. Don't let Pizzagate cause you to blow up potential bridges, or ruin your happiness at regular family and social events. I've found that for now, limiting personal and social media contact with my nut job friends - and upping contact with old and new like-minded friends - is productive, encouraging, and makes life far less stressful. You never know, our diehard deniers may get redpilled someday, but they'll be more willing to talk about it, when they percieve they've done it on their own.  I'm holding off my bridge-burning of shit-stupid friends for the apocalypse.

                It reminds me of what was said of Scientology. You can't make people believe it's absolutely an evil cult, they've gotta figure this out on their own. IMO, you can maybe assist with some eye opening documentary, or a really well done webpage. I'm never sure if I should be sending people here publicly, but I do give them the address here if we're speaking person to person. In the end we do have to open our own eyes, that way there's some real passion when fighting for these children. We see it, more and more normal people will eventually become furious. (I've found its alefantis's own IG that makes jaws drop, his big mouth will bring down this ship!) But if some drowsy people are also following, suddenly read something, not so drowsy anymore. Reading discussions sometimes is the key, and that may be an alarm clock of sorts. I take more in sometimes reading along, sometimes videos. Presenting both! They can choose or look at all of it.
               </p>
               <p>
                I spread the message, answer what I can (trafficking is serious here so it doesn't take any awakening, they're awake here), I send them to various primers, and then I keep it movin. I do think my daughters Uni could use some posters and fliers. When I'm over this plague I'm headed for their rec center. We keep spreading it, it'll eventually come together. I just hope it's not very long. If only I had one superpower.

                 People (older at least) want stuff that looks like 'real news,' so the Ben Swann piece is good to show. That's about the only thing my wife would look at. Some people just want to go back to sleep. Or to Dancing w/ The Stars. Or partying. But freedom isn't free ... some Greek ruler once passed a law that made it illegal for a citizen not to be interested in a public controversy/scandal.

                  I will have to edit and add our local news link. Today they focused on trafficking and they said "the way it's set up today, it's online, it's like ordering
                  <em>
                   a pizza
                  </em>
                  " My husband's eyes got wide, he replayed it and said he believes now. We've always been a bad area for trafficking, but being awareness month I think arresting some folks hurting kids and trafficking to celebrate awareness right. Encourage victims, come forward...
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  This month is a GREAT month to redpill people you know without sounding insane because of the awareness month. I am using that too!

                  Maybe pizza just means a piece of something you can't speak aloud of...drugs, all of the evil things, in this case.

                   Ha, that's a great story, and good for your husband. That's awfully coincidental that they would place pizza and trafficking in the same context. It would be nice to see that local news clip. 
You might remember the piece the MSM did on the woman supposedly groped by Trump on the airplane. It was professionally done, and looked believable. That's what pizzagate needs, a well-done (professional) documentary. It's just that that's what people are used to - and they don't want to (or have time) to research, they want it served up to them.

            I talk a lot about it, just one really good friend looked into it and believes it. The rest of the people I talked to think I went totally nuts. I live in germany and most people only have heard about it on the radio or on television and think it's "fake news". Even the ones I thought are "critical thinkers" won't look into it.

               I used to think our best friends were over the top protective of their children (our God children).  Now, I want to be extremely cautious about making sure they are safe all the time.  I don't talk to them about my change of heart I have about how safe they are. Not sure if they know about pizzagate, but, I tell them all the time to be very careful, be cautious, be ever vigilant  around strangers. They might think I am crazy, but, I  don't think I would ever get over something happening to them. Parents really do have so much to worry them.....with so much evil out there. Please please close down this evil cabal.

            No, if this happened to me it would be amazing and a breath of fresh air. Right now I know exactly one person who I think kind of believes it, but he just seems like the type of guy who agrees with you so as to not cause social friction and doesn't seem like he actually cares.

            Relative to the size of the population, this community is extremely small so us researchers are dispersed enough so that we don't have too high of a chance of finding each other. Add in the fact that a lot people are probably  researching this are doing so quietly as to not alienate themselves socially/ professionally and it makes it exceedingly hard for us to meet irl.
           </p>
           <p>
            Maybe we can come up with some come of secret symbol or fashion to demonstrate irl we are pizzagate believers? Something unique yet innocuous that we can discuss here but the larger population won't be aware of.

            The same here.   I won't talk to members of my family again about it, they are just clueless.   Friends think I am losing it.
Was listening to Lionel Nation on yt and even he said he can't talk to anyone.

             Sometimes I think I am losing it myself with all this so I don't tell too many people about it.  I have told my family about it and they have all said it wouldn't surprise them at all if it was true.

              I think that too occasionally until I stop and think about all the gross hashtags, creepy kid pictures, kid coffins, satanic and Illuminati ritual references, etc, etc, etc, etc, etc.

              It is real, and many of these people that choose to ignore it, will have to answer for their lack of compassion for the weakest among us (children).

             My family is still bitter towards me when I mention how I was right about zero evidence for WMDs in Iraq.  Pizzagate is much more believable to them, they're supportive, just not interested in looking into it because of how dark it is.

              The truth is Saddam bluffed western intelligence agencies. they had good reason to reach that conclusion. I believe they were always there, hidden, and could even be the very ones used in syria

                Yeah, once in awhile I have to kind of skim through and also just not look.  Otherwise it would give me nightmares.  I have read some pretty horrible stuff.  I cannot watch the videos.  It would really have a horrible effect on me. I keep going because of the kids.  I keep hoping I will see something I can help with along the way.

              My facebook is all Pizzagate all the time now.  I unfriended about 1k people I don't really know ( I was researching self-publishing), but kept my page private until all this.  Now every post is public.  I get some trolls, but they're so lame it doesn't really matter.

               Well I also think it's smart to have tact, and to share info in a way that is relatable and digestible.

              I've lost friends and folks have deleted me. They tell me that nobody cares. It's like " You &amp; PizzaGate"
Like what does that mean? Ignore at your own Peril. 
I'm not going to set quiet and talk about BS when a holocaust of children is ongoing.

               Exactly. Meanwhile, children are experiencing the worst horrors imaginable! Folks refuse to entertain the idea that a so-called "conspiracy theory" might actually be real. All anyone needs to do is start researching online and the evidence piles up.

               Yep, this is what "the masses" have been trained to believe.  "Conspiracy Theorist" was made into a derogatory term.  But if you need a rejoinder, you can ask them back, "What do you think the FBI investigates?"  In the recent release of FBI documents on the Clinton Foundation, (

               Last night I brought it up on a double date and everyone looked down at the table and the guys hid their faces behind their phones, literally. Just... What?! But everyone was happy to compare the Clintons to house of cards episodes. Smh. (Edit for spelling)

            I was driving home from work the other day and saw that someone had put pizzagate stickers on their car saying things like "MSM is fake news" and "#pizzagate is real".  Their windows were rolled down, and I was eager to show them support, so I shouted "PIZZAGATE IS REAL!".  They heard me and began looking around for me, and even opened their door for a second.  The light then turned green and I didn't have time to write down some of the websites they had on their bumper.  I hope I encouraged them to continue spreading the truth about pizzagate.

              I'd rather not, but it was cut together letter by letter. It looked like all the letters were the same font/size so idk where he got the letters from.
