            Looking at the pictures of his car afterward, it does not make sense. When police do a pit maneuver, cars spin wildly out of control. They are only done on highways. You can see the road is narrow and houses like the street. So cops wanted to slam into the guy and have him lose control of his car and hit a house, other motorists or pedestrians?

            After much research this is a hoax. IMO the old man wasn't killed and here's why.
My first clue was the the reaction of his family while being interviewed. There were no tears, hell they didn't even have puffy eyes and this was the day after the supposed shooting. Forgive the stereotype, but usually when black women are crying, yelling,wailing and there's alot of carrying on about their lost loved one.  Video link

            This morning I watched this video of the FB "live" recording of the killing.

            I couldn't post at the time, but it's been edited since I watched it between 9a-10a this morning. The edit was where it can clearly be seen the gun barrel is above the old man's head. So when the shooter fired it would've gone over his head in to the empty field behind the fence. Now it just shows the shooter pointing the gun directly at the old man's face.

            is right about something being in the bag. I took pics of still frames of this video with my smart phone and just below the 
hand holding the bag in front of his face, I can see what appears to be a blood bladder or bottle of fake blood. These are used all the time in first responder training drills to make it look/feel realistic as possible. Here are some examples. Just search first responder drill props.

            The containers come in many forms. Bladders, pouches etc that are placed underneath clothing and then are expressed when the blood needs to flow.

            This video by Ole Dammegard is of the Oslo hoax and shows the kind of fakery that goes on ff to 9:28-15:15

            He explains the "action, reaction, solution" equation of all these hoaxes which are designed to bring the masses into submission. He is well versed  and has a lot of videos on the various hoaxes worldwide.
           </p>
           <p>
            Back to the old man, I would think he would've been blown back into the fence; or, dropped in a crumpled heap where he stood when shot. Not lying nicely on his left side with one foot placed perfectly on top of the other.
           </p>
           <p>
            The blood looks fake as hell as it's too bright and looks like it was applied to the sidewalk with a 4" roller. The direction of travel of the blood isn't right and how the hell does it go to just below his knee, stop, then pick back up mid shin, wrapping around his foot. Then only blood on the old man was on his left cheek and looked like that was rolled on too. WTF do they really think we are that naive?
           </p>
           <p>
            I also heard 2 different news reports on two different radio stations about the shooters "capture and suicide" today. The first stated that a Pennsylvania citizen called in a tip that they had seen the shooter. Police spotted him and after a short car pursuit, the shooter stopped his car  then shot himself.
The second report on a different station, claimed the police spotted the shooters car in a McDonalds parking lot and when they approached him, he shot himself. WTF.  These reports were maybe 2 hours apart. What the hell is going on and being planned and/or covered up.
           </p>

            Getting really tired of this fake crap.

            I think Stephen Stevens and the old man are gone from the world, how it happened remains a mystery. Leave it to the world admins, to provide a tongue-in-cheek Easter egg "hunt".

            What I've learnt from this is that the establishment is trying to "create" cases/make  up scenarios on the fly to try &amp; be ahead of the modern day wealth of information when it happens there &amp; then.
           </p>
           <p>
            In other words.
           </p>
           <p>
            Situation happens. Pull back, mock looking for someone, mock reward to reinforce facade mock searching, bide time to make story up to cover whole truth? find them suicided....
           </p>
           <ul>
            <li>
             <p>
              While on killing spree
Family of victim forgive him instantly...while he was on the killing spree? No time to grieve, anything??
             </p>
            </li>
            <li>
             <p>
              One news article stated. Police admit have no idea where he is, but will find him?
             </p>
            </li>
           </ul>
           <p>
            Ok, first, what cops admit they just have no clue. They talk more on the case, locating, tracking. Not "Oh we just don't know, oops"
           </p>
           <p>
            Second. It reads We'll find him, we have no clue where he is....
           </p>
           <ul>
            <li>
             Reward: $50,000? Seriously? For someone who is supposed to be a live killer &amp; that reward? I know of countries that give 1mil for just giving information that leads to a successful arrest of a high profile target.
            </li>
           </ul>
           <p>
            Point being, sounds like the reward is a carrot on a stick "Oh look we're making it look like we're genuine"
           </p>
           <ul>
            <li>
             There's more questions than answers. Also pay attention how the media writes. If it starts to contradict truth, to the point they are trying to push a narrative harder then they're usual over emphasis of everything, then you know something is up.

            As far as what he said and the fact that police had no other "victims" to account for his seemingly sincere belief that he truly had killed 12. It looks to me like he was ROLLED, and what that means is that he was treated to some very heavy handed mental manipulation. They kicked off the ROLL sequence with destroyed finances at the casino, losing all his money. They then continued with DREAM SEQUENCES that made him believe himself to be a serial murderer when he WASN'T. They then continued it through the REAL killing of the innocent old man.
           </p>
           <p>
            The question was who did that to him and why? If I had to guess the names he mentioned would be the first place to look, his mom may be his "MOM" (in other words he may have been her SCHMUCK - that's how women call the men they control in this world). He also is above average intelligence and may have had a stripe of decency in him, those involved with administering child trafficking where he works may have gotten nervous that he was going to detect something (testing out his personality via dream interrogations) and it was decided to make him yet another Easter sacrifice victim.

            Ahhh, that is the type of thing that could make you, not just lose hope for humanity, but actively hate it. I'd be mentioning a monstrous woman's name (my ex stalker) too in such a scenario (she is also a pedophile and enough news scrutiny would destroy her) but...It's now obvious that they would shield her instead. (Also, why kill innocents? Dude must have been regular ol' crazy on top of that, or truly terrified of his workplace)

            I already mentioned this in another thread, but the guy worked for a company, that i think was called beech creek, which has a website specializing in adoption, foster parenting and other things which have given us cause to raise our eyebrows  in other settings. Not saying it's anything, just thought others might be able to discern whether that company is legit.

            I see some speculation going on, as to whether the victim was in some way connected to the killer. The victim (Robert Godwin, Sr.) was definitely just a random man, in the
            <strong>
             wrong place at the wrong time
            </strong>
            , just walking down the street carrying a plastic shopping bag, like he's just been to the store. Here are details from
            <a href="http://heavy.com/news/2017/04/videos-alleged-cleveland-killer-steve-stevie-steve-stephens-graphic/">
             that terrible video (available on this
             <em>
              Heavy
             </em>
             web page)
            </a>
            :
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             Stephens is driving his car down a street.
            </p>
            <p>
             <strong>
              Stephens:
             </strong>
             <em>
              Found me somebody, somebody I'm about to kill, I'm gonna kill this guy right here. He's a old dude.
             </em>
            </p>
            <p>
             Then Stephens pulls his car over, gets out, approaches Godwin.
            </p>
            <p>
             <strong>
              Stephens:
             </strong>
             <em>
              Hi. Can you give me a favor? Can you say Joy Lane?
             </em>
            </p>
            <p>
             <strong>
              Godwin:
             </strong>
             <em>
              What?
             </em>
            </p>
            <p>
             <strong>
              Stephens:
             </strong>
             (repeats)
             <em>
              Can you say Joy Lane?
             </em>
            </p>
            <p>
             <strong>
              Godwin:
             </strong>
             <em>
              Joy Lane?
             </em>
            </p>
            <p>
             <strong>
              Stephens:
             </strong>
             <em>
              Yeah, she's the reason this is about to happen to you. How old are you?
             </em>
            </p>
            <p>
             Godwin puts his arms up (he obviously sees the gun).
            </p>
            <p>
             <strong>
              Godwin:
             </strong>
             <em>
              Oh man, look, hey, listen, listen, I don't know, I don't know nobody by that name.
             </em>
            </p>
            <p>
             That's when Stephens shoots and kills Godwin, then continues to take video of Godwin lying dead on the sidewalk.
            </p>
            <p>
             As Stephens walks back to his car, he says,
             <strong>
              <em>
               That motherfucker dead because of you, Joy.
              </em>
             </strong>
             Then he groans and says
             <strong>
              <em>
               Murtis Taylor, Beech Brook, all that shit.
              </em>
             </strong>

              I had that same thought when I saw the video. The bright color of the blood seems odd, but I also thought, that could be due to reflection, video quality, something else(?)
             </p>
             <p>
              So, you and I think the blood looks fake/odd. If this whole thing is fake, that's a careless mistake (that would have been easy to get right) - OR - realism wasn't all that important. Real or fake, I still can't find a
              <strong>
               satisfactory explanation of WHY this incident happened/was staged
              </strong>
              . I have zero ideas as to WHY someone, even a mentally-disturbed person (lucid-enough to publicly post the act on Facebook), would murder a stranger. OR, WHY someone would commit such a hoax.
             </p>
             <p>
              The link to Honeybee's video about this being fake (posted here) worked, but the video isn't there (for me). I read some of the comments. Someone mentioned improper clean-up of the crime scene, without the precautions that would be normally taken for human remains. Plus other
              <em>
               debunking
              </em>
              , over blood-spatter pattern, position of the body, ...
             </p>
             <p>
              That
              <strong>
               both Stephens and Joy Lane work(ed) for child advocacy agencies
              </strong>
              - plus, expecting that we will NEVER get any decent, further investigation of this incident, or the people involved, from mainstream media, makes it worthwhile to continue looking into, and discussing here.

              The victim's name is Godwin, not Goodwin, and you've confused Stephens' girlfriend, Joy Lane, with (according to the article linked below) Godwin's girlfriend, Angela Smith.

            So I haven't seen the video of him killing the old man to know if it was legit he killed him and haven't heard anything about any other victims...what if he didn't really kill the old man but they are using him as a victim because all the other victims if there really are any, are the people he knows run the pedophile stores at the places he went....What if he was casing schools because those schools are involved and he was waiting for them to come out. Of course the media won't be filling us in on any of the people or what they probably knew he was on a mission doing...."good guy". Of course they had to kill him so he didn't talk and the why didn't he say what he was doing part can be answered by good ole Facebook censoring. He said enough and got shut down while they acted like they didn't know what he was doing all that time till they killed him..

           <p>
            i have been wondering about this. People are assuming that was Sunday, but what if it was not?
           </p>
           <p>
            did he leave a trail of dead kids, or did he discover something that made him snap?
           </p>
           <p>
            One warning: criminals will hire crazy people to do their dirty work. That way if the crazy people get caught, they can be thrown to the wolves and society will blame them, not the masterminds.
           </p>
           <p>
            So he could have been a mentally unhinged guy that just happens to work for a shady child smuggling ring.
           </p>
           <p>
            The best thing to do, is to put all of this aside and
            <strong>
             INVESTIGATE BEECH BROOK AND ALL RELEVANT GROUPS

             I wondered this as well. I find it hard to believe he could have killed more and have it not be connected to him yet or have the bodies not discovered yet.
            </p>
            <p>
             One thing that strikes me as odd is that he doesn't fit the profile for rage killing. He worked at the same place 10+ years, had a steady girlfriend, all seems good except his gambling issues. I suspect he discovered something or did something he couldn't live with anymore. I am interested to see if he sent anything to newspapers or networks like the virginia tech guy did. Something made him snap but this was a bit too thought out to be a spur of the moment thing. He tells his mother goodbye on Saturday and does this Sunday. If I snap, I will act right away. This isn't right.

             <p>
              I also wonder something else too: perhaps he picked an old person on purpose, someone who has already lived a good life?
             </p>
             <p>
              On a side note, i wonder if they will blame this on drugs?

            It is so important to protect children from child abuse.  Abuse can really break a child's radar of right and wrong and has the potential to turn them into insecure people who power-trip on others.

             This seems like a False Flag to me.  Since when has the FBI offered $50K reward for one person killed.  Yes, it is an awful thing to have killed this poor grand father, but this just does not pass the smell rest with me.  Another take the attention off of Pizza/Pedogate imo.  If it really did happen, then they sure made a really long weekend out of one person being killed.  I don't know what the real truth is but it is not what we are being fed.

              I disagree. It wasn't for one person being killed. It's for "any tips leading to the arrest of.." What was something big that happened on these forums that they needed the world to focus on? Not everything is a false flag. Don't cry wolf.

            So why kill an old man? He gained tons of press he could have easily put out another video after if he had something to say. Not trying to take away from the shady shit those companies might be up to but that dude is a piece of shit and is better off dead.

            FROM THE POST: I stayed up literally ALL night the night before last trying to figure this whole situation out. In a nutshell what i found out: Murtis Taylor (the company that Joy Lane works at) is a corrupt AF agency who neglects people who depend on them for mental health treatment resulting in a lot of people who end up losing their shit, killing themselves, and killing others.
           </p>
           <p>
            Murtis Taylor also uses their power to take kids from homes for BS reasons and sues to gain legal custody of children to put into foster care
           </p>
           <p>
            Beech Brook (killers former workplace) is a facility for troubled children, and until last year also functioned as an adoption/foster care agency/facility
           </p>
           <p>
            These two places are within miles and in the same county as the international adoption agency that the FBI raided months ago
           </p>
           <p>
            Children were sexually abused at Beech Brook by its staff
           </p>
           <p>
            More than 3100 reports of missing children in 2015 in this county alone
           </p>
           <p>
            Dozens of cases of child abuse just reopened after being ignored/not investigated for years
           </p>
           <p>
            Beech Brook and Murtis Taylor are very short distance from Great Lakes which means children could be trafficked to Canada, New York, and through to the Atlantic Ocean
           </p>
           <p>
            2 pastors arrested days ago in this county for child trafficking/child sex abuse.
           </p>
           <p>
            One of the pastors wives works for the government for CPS type agency
           </p>
           <p>
            ...and lots of other shit i found out too but thats all i can remember right now, but like i said, there is a LOT more fuckery i dug up. There is definitely more to this story than meets the eye.
           </p>
           <p>
            Why do you think Stephens kept on and kept on and kept on mentioning Joy Lane, Murtis Taylor, and Beech Brook?
           </p>
           <p>
            Why do you think he said to let his boss know he wouldn’t be at work the next day he posted, “I’m sorry team but I’m to far gone [sic] ... I’m the #goodguy”?
           </p>
           <p>
            Things that make you go "hmmmmm".

            EDIT: Ok, so dude is dead now, but WHY IS THE PASSENGER WINDOW BLOWN OUT AND NOT THE DRIVER SIDE? Judging by the shooting vid, the guy is obviously right handed.
           </p>
           <p>
            WHY IS THERE NO BLOOD SPATTER?

            This is going to drive me crazy.

            I feel SO fucking tinfoil right now. But this doesn't make sense. Did person 2 force him to shoot the old man somehow? Like threated his whole family if he didn't?
           </p>
           <p>
            Was Stephens wanting to expose all the fuckery at MT and BB and was found out and then forced to ruin his reputation by murdering someone on cam? Cops finally close in and then he has to be offed by passenger#2 and found with "intentional gunshot wound to the head".
           </p>
           <p>
            I mean seriously. What the hell is going on?

             Great work. And wasn't there "13" victims? On Easter weekend. And they say he shot himself so he can't answer any questions...

             Another thing that seems very odd to me is how long it took them to track him down???  Where did he go and what did he do between Sunday and today?

              "They" didn't track him down. A McDonald's clerk called police to report him. How is he in an area populated enough to have a McDonald's and no one else but these clerks report the sighting??? We're they even looking for him?
             </p>
             <p>
              Edit: I would understand if he was in a rural area like where I live. You could hide out easily here but in a small city? No possible. How did he even make it out of state?
