<p>A shocking new Foreign Intelligence Service (SVR) report circulating in the Kremlin today is alleging that an elite team of Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) assassins controlled by President Obama have gunned down the husband of a US prosecutor who was preparing to charge former President William (Bill) Clinton with crimes relating to his having had sex with an underage girl child kept as a sex slave by hisclose personal billionaire friend Jeffery Epstein.</p>
<p>According to this report, the SVR regularly monitors the locations and activities of these CIA “hit squads” that in 2013 were described by Pulitzer Prize winning journalist for the New York Times, Mark Mazzetti (in his book titled The Way of the Knife: The CIA, a Secret Army, and a War at the Ends of the Earth), as being President Obama’s “personal army” who he has authorized to have “unfettered assassination authority”.</p>

<p>I want to find the original Russian report. I used translate tool at the site it is supposed to be on, but couldn\'t find it. </p>
<p>So, if you know a bit or a lot of Russian, can you kindly visit <a href="http://svr.gov.ru/">http://svr.gov.ru/</a>, and look for a press release, it is for 31 May 2016, and it is about the Russians monitoring a CIA hit team moving in and out of Atlanta. If you are worried I am trying to trap you, try browsing through way-back machine.</p>
<p>Personally I think it is probbly \'fake news\' and a dead-end, as Russians wouldn\'t want to reveal they monitor this stuff.</p>',

            Hi OP. I received your pm, I found no report released on that date. Nothing about the described CIA hit team either, I would urge other Russian goats to look for themselves in case I missed anything.

             Thanks for the tip ghost_marauder!

            <p>
             But I did try this before, and looked around the site a bit... I can't find what I am looking before either because the translation is crap or the report is not there.
            </p>
            <p>
             I thought maybe someone who knows Russian can maybe look through Russian media too, maybe it was covered.
