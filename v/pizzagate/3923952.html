            MB2, Threadreaderapp does not archive tweets. If Twitter suspends the account, or the author deletes his tweet(s), they disappear from the ThreadreaderApp thread. You need to use TweetSave or Archive.fo, and verify it got the whole thread. Usually it does not when it's a more than five tweets in a thread.
           </p>
           <p>
            ProTip: If you list the urls for each individual tweet in the thread when you make your Voat submission, Derram will automatically save them all to TweetSave. It's a bit of work, but worth it for certain threads.

            I don't know if anyone here remembers, but I constantly was on a site for urban explorers that went into tunnels, sewers, old treasure, mines ect. It was a bit like Peakbagger, but geared for people who like going in places like that. They would share old microfiche out of libraries, and books showing all the old tunnels. Lots of interesting tunnels from the prohibition that were supposedly filled in.  I could not find it somewhere around 2013/14? I guess Google shut it down. I think that site got too close to more than one target.

              On it! Xoxo Thanks Think! I remember seeing an interview on one of the British shows in the morning, not the one with piiers Morgan but another older couple, super awesome thy are, and had WALLERSTEINER  as the guest when Princess Bride Beatrice was marrying dopey Jack Whatever (business partner
              <strong>
               GEORGE CLOONEY

              wink wink)
             </p>
             <p>
              Honestly, WALLERSTEINER could not have come across more as a total creepo same as all those other posh British pedis. Like, why is he as headmaster of a prestigious school going on live tv and kissing his favorite little ex-students ass. Inappropriate!

            <p>
             Trinity Church in the City of Boston, located in the Back Bay of Boston, Massachusetts, is a parish of the Episcopal Diocese of Massachusetts. ..In addition to worship, the parish is actively involved in service to the community, pastoral care, programs for children and teenagers, and Christian education for all ages. The church is home to several high-level choirs, including the Trinity Choir, Trinity Schola, Trinity Choristers, and Trinity Chamber Choir. The building is currently under study for becoming a Boston Landmark
            </p>
            <p>
             The church and parish house were designed by Henry Hobson Richardson and construction took place from 1872 to 1877, when the complex was consecrated. Situated on Copley Square in Back Bay, Trinity Church is the building that established Richardson's reputation. It is the birthplace and archetype of the Richardsonian Romanesque style, characterized by a clay roof, polychromy, rough stone, heavy arches, and a massive tower. This style was soon adopted for a number of public buildings across the United States. The stone used was Dedham Granite.
            </p>
            <p>
             In addition to their primary function of supporting worship, the choirs of Trinity Church are fixtures in the rich musical landscape of Boston. The Trinity Choir has toured extensively, and can be heard on several critically acclaimed recordings. The Trinity Choristers are a group of children who learn music and sing in the tradition of the Royal School of Church Music. The current Director of Music and Organist is Richard Webster. The Trinity Choir and Trinity Choristers tour England every three years, serving as choirs-in-residence at major houses of worship such as Ely Cathedral, Chichester Cathedral, and Westminster Abbey (summer 2016).
            </p>
            <p>
             The parish supports many forms of community outreach and social justice ministry. These include partnerships with Rosie's Place, the Greater Boston Interfaith Organization, Pine Street Inn, Habitat for Humanity, Community Servings, the Walk for Hunger, the Rodman Ride for Kids, and others. The Trinity Boston Foundation is a nonprofit organization with a mission to support the social and emotional well-being and development of young people.

           <blockquote>
            <p>
             Henry Hobson Richardson (September 29, 1838 – April 27, 1886) was a prominent American architect, best known for his work in a style that became known as Richardsonian Romanesque. Along with Louis Sullivan and Frank Lloyd Wright, Richardson is one of "the recognized trinity of American architecture"
            </p>
            <p>
             Richardson was born at the Priestley Plantation in St. James Parish, Louisiana,[2] and spent part of his childhood in New Orleans, where his family lived on Julia Row in a red brick house designed by the architect Alexander T. Wood.[3] He was the great-grandson of inventor and philosopher Joseph Priestley, who is usually credited with the discovery of oxygen..
            </p>
            <p>
             Richardson's great admirer Louis Sullivan adapted Richardson's characteristic lessons of texture, massing, and the expressive language of stone walling (see Richardson's noted Chicago building Marshall Field's Wholesale Store), particularly at Chicago's Auditorium Building, and these influences are detectable in the work of Sullivan's own student Frank Lloyd Wright.

            <blockquote>
             <p>
              Old South Church in Boston, Massachusetts, (also known as New Old South Church or Third Church) is a historic United Church of Christ congregation first organized in 1669. Its present building was designed in the Gothic Revival style by Charles Amos Cummings and Willard T. Sears, completed in 1873, and amplified by the architects Allen &amp; Collens between 1935–1937. The church, which was built on newly filled land in the Back Bay section of Boston, is located at 645 Boylston Street on Copley Square.
             </p>
             <p>
              ..Members of the congregation have included Samuel Adams, William Dawes, Benjamin Franklin, Samuel Sewall, and Phillis Wheatley. In 1773, Samuel Adams gave the signals from the Old South Meeting House for the "war whoops" that started the Boston Tea Party.
             </p>
             <p>
              During the Unitarian Movement of the early 19th century, Old South was the sole Congregational Church in Boston to adhere to the doctrine of Trinitarianism. In 1816 Old South Church joined with Park Street Church to form the City Mission Society, a social justice society to serve Boston's urban poor. During the American Civil War, Old South became a recruiting center for the Union Army under minister Jacob Manning. Though the congregation was not entirely abolitionist, it strongly supported the Union cause. The conclusion of the Civil War was followed by an expansive time of increased inclusion for the congregation. Under minister George Angier Gordon the congregation moved from its meeting house at Washington Street to its Back Bay location in 1875, occupying the present church constructed on newly filled land.

            This was a good dig. I think it has something to do with the federal reserve. - You ever seen the Boston reserve? - Place is like a fucking impenatrable fortress. Just take a look at the building. - Mother fucking thing looks like it's got murder holes at the top in case it were to be assailed. - Financial district in downtown Boston is surrounded by the dirtiest, scummiest, most criminal type places that exist. - Fucking departed wasn't kidding. Dirty cops, and owned mother fuckers living in hi rises over looking the commons, - right down the street from the kiddie-fuckers and FED. - Yeah, something's going on in Boston.

              I was at the Occupy Wall Street protests that happened back in the early 2000's. I didn't march or protest, but I was there talking to folks and just learning about what they were doing. -  - Boston is largely white, but hosts a large international student and immigrant population. There were events and sprinklings of BLM here and there, but the main focus of the time was the housing bubble, predatory lending, and income disparity.

               Do you remember the DNC in 2004, how they basically shut down the city and had a cage for protestors? Interestingly (?) the only time I’ve seen riot police in Boston that wasn’t pro-sports related

                I missed that one. - Tell you a story though. -I'd been working at the hospital there for a while right after finishing university. We were asked to prepare for some emergency training exercises. The scenario was that a "rogue scientist/terrorist" detonated an explosive devise on red-line. EMT and Doc's all on standby and cleared several hours to take in fake patients with all sorts of misc injuries; simulated loss of limbs, shrapnel, various types of burns. Etc. - Whole thing was filmed and documented, and took the latter half of the day. - It felt weird. It was sudden, and just didn't seem right. Kinda spooky, and suits everywhere at the hospital that day. A week later the Boston Marathon bombings happened. - Knowning what we know now. - I'm certain that shit was just more homegrown Obama admin terror. - All the shit we saw and trained for that afternoon actually happened in the real bombing. - Can't make this shit up. - Boston's dirty as fuck. - It felt like they just walked up to the hospital and were like - Yeah you guys better get ready. - Bomb's gonna go off soon, and you're hospital's gonna be overrun.- Sure enough that shit happened. -It got wiped from the news, but there were private security type guys walking around with backpacks &amp; sunglasses etc. Showed them just placing the backpack over there in broad daylight. - . . . Fucking sick world we're living in. Stay safe patriot.

                 Sorry for the delay! I just saw this reply and wanted to acknowledge it. That’s so interesting ..... do you think they might have incorporated the footage from the trainings as part of the actual event? ... Interestingly, I was visiting Haiti when that all went down, and the six months prior to that I was living in Asheville , NC.  I have always felt like I came back to a very different city than the one I left, but never could quite put my finger on exactly what was different. “Dirty as fuck” sums it up quite succinctly .

                <p>
                 Anyone else with any boston stories or insights to share ?? I generally tend to feel like the majority of the population is NPCs and opioid zombies .::. And real estate developers, who have caught wind that there’s no one here who gives a shit about what they do , so they essentially come in , take a gigantic, multimillion dollar dump in the middle of wherever..  everybody acts offended but nobody will do anything about it, they just shrug and say ,”it’s too big to move!” so instead people start paying $4000 a month to live inside of it ??!!

               Exactly.  And what kind of exposure did those protests get?  They were mocked and basically forced to shut down.  There were no changes.  No three day weekends.  No rebranded products.  And there certainly weren't many, if any, riots.  Fuck the bastard jews who are in charge of our lives

              Yes. Haven't seen the roof, or anything like that. - Just talking proximity. Also, the design of the building is odd. The two sides being the only way to the upper floors with that space underneath? - Strange. - I think if the Cabal had had their way, there'd be a lot more brutalist architecture standing there. - Some of the government buildings in Boston look like straight up fortresses that were rethought at the last minute. If I remember right, City Hall in Boston was supposed to look like the tower of Sauron from LOTR at one point, but it never happened. - The building they eventually did build was no better.

On August 22, 1851, the schooner America won the 100 Guinea Cup (renamed America’s Cup) from the Royal Yacht Squadron by defeating 14 British yachts in a 53-mile race around Isle of Wight. The syndicate that captured the trophy later assigned the Cup to the New York Yacht Club with a Deed of Gift, under condition that it be preserved as a perpetual Challenge Cup for friendly competition between foreign nations.
