<p>So I\'ve always though the mafia was heavily involved in professional and college sports.  This article came out <a href="https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=91415111">https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=91415111</a>  This happens to be my friends dads college friend.  He was involved with the mafia and was rigging the NBA finals and many more games.  My friends dad actually has texts from Tim Donaghy saying who to place bets on.  
</p>
<p>Rumors are that the super bowl and many sporting events are huge events for human trafficking.  
</p>
<p>When i was in college i had a speaker in one of my classes.  She was saying that most professional NBA teams lose 10 to 20 million dollars a year.  The ones that make money are in highly populated areas like LA, NY, Portland.  She was saying  the teams are basically hobbies for very rich people who don\'t worry about losing 20 million a year.  
</p>
<p>This in my opinion, is proof that our theories are correct.  A lot of sports teams are mafia owned money laundering corporations who are making lots of money trafficking humans at their sports events.

<p>Lifestyles of the super rich.</p>',

              If ure using fed notes or the banking ssytem u r using ceasars money..ie ur causing thr govt to go into debt ...because u dont use the money to pay down the debt..
Did u not use fed ious and bank credit ious to buy the silver...so to buy silver ur own govt had to go into debt..
 This is why the govt considers us the enemy of the state...
We r also enemy of our own estate..in that we never settle our own account with the birth trust created for us by our mother ...it was created to account for whwt we owe her..as she has done labour to bring us into the earth vessel...we dont own anything becasue we owe this debt ...ehen we labour we r actwully renting the earth vessel....thats why u never get paid...only receive an iou ie credit..
We should take that credit to reduce debt at ur own trewdury that has to go into debt because we individually dont reduce debt ...with the iou given to us..
We become enemy of our own estate

               that was a really good explanation.  Thank you.

               I've been listening to Jordan Maxwell for years.  He talks about this all the time. Kate of Gaia talks about this too.  It is such a complex and confusing subject though.

              <p>
               Can you explain how we settle our own account with the birth trust created for us by our mother?

               <p>
                As simple as depositing ur money into a bank account ..
               </p>
               <p>
                But now u decide to use ur credit and assets and use it to reduce debt at the US treasury..
Its the euivalent ofndeclaring peace with Rome , whonis ur mothers accountant..
               </p>
               <p>
                So first email the debt reductiin department of thebUS treasury and instruct them to accept creditnfrom ur side to reduce their debt..in return that theybacknowledge ur surety rights over them .
               </p>
               <p>
                The reason for that is so that u dont want to use the debt banking system to pay ur bills...and u want the US to settle all charges in ur name ..including income tax charges..
Also confirm whether they movable property ( cars etc)
..in return fornu using it to travel without licence
               </p>
               <p>
                Also whether they accept account receivables..ie so that u can provide business services to memebers of the public....
               </p>
               <p>
                Also any immovable property. Sucha as a house..in return for u to live in it for free with maintenece charges or any other housing cost covered..
               </p>
               <p>
                Land as well...
So instead of registereing to the pirate side ienthe State ..u surrnder everything to gods acccountant ..
               </p>
               <p>
                So u no longer use ceasars money..so dont have to pay ceasar any tax .mie his war tax..
U pay god and gods accountant acknowledges its bond to u..
The birth certifcate is proof that Rome is bonded to u..
Like anybshare or fixed deposit the holdrr has the claim of property..
The property is ur beneficiary status..in the form of Romes account payable to the mother..they will serve and protect
The US is us.
Game over.

               </p>
               <p>
                U cann do it individually or as a group , busineess..
               </p>
               <p>
                So email us debt reduction department and confirm they will set off all charges in ur name once u beg9n to use crediit to reduce their debt..

                This double book entry system for the Mother (matrix) is known as Christ..who accounts for all debts..
We yave been running it in reverse.
When we flip our choice to peace ..Christ re turns

                  Its time to speak to Ceasar...surrender to Ceasar we win, we fight He wins..the only game in town where when we fold ..we clear the table..
Legally its called reversionary interest..
We have been in Hell (state of debt)
For years we were finding this virus ..(reversionary interest...when we choose peace Ceasar is obliged to be our trustee)

                  It makes more sense when we understand there is no money..what we think as payment is actually the exact opposite..its a recotd of a failure to pay..just like when u buy building materials on credit for some project ..u receive the materials and for thr credit period the supplier records that u have failed to pay..in the end the transaction is complete when we settle the account..say after 3 months..
The same with our life ..we rent our earth vessel from the mother and her accountant ..in exchange for credit....
We can settle it at any point in time..but we r tricked to loan it to their war game ..which is dependent on this act of ignorance..and thrn they can call us enemy of the state ..and this gives them licence to pass more bills to increase debt as we dont settle the account ..and then introduce statutues to control the inflatiin that results from ever increasing debt as credits..

                 <p>
                  Can u see the non stop merry go round...and all by our consent..
In papal bull dum diversas they call it perpetual servitude..its perpetual because we r programmed to consent being on the merry go round..
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  I can explain it better but u begin to get to see the code and the futility of the war game..

            I really wonder whether there were minors forced into prostitution involved, although the first reports didn't mention that.

             lets be honest here.  With everything coming out lately i would surprised if minors weren't involved. 
I don't have proof. This is mafia though.  This is just the very tip of the icerberg.

              Oh I do agree. There was a 19 yr old male arrested so we can imagine that some of those "women" were minors.  I can't wait to hear who is involved.  The Officer said the names would be newsworthy.  Most of the time when arrested there are some teens involved.  No matter what age this is a horrid business.

              Some believe this whole story broke to keep the more important story, JUSSIE SMOLLETT HATE CRIME
HOAX out of the news. We have already discussed Presidential candidate Kamala Harris here and it appears that the hoax was a lead up to a Dem started Race War which would put Harris in office. "Coincidentally," before the hoax, she inexplicably was promoting an "anti-lynching" bill with some gay "goodies" thrown in at the last minute.
             </p>
             <p>
              Pizzagaters who oppose Harris should take the time to read this very informative article on her connection with the hoax:

            One bit of advice.  Do not reveal so much info about your private life.  The name of the owner is in the article all they have to do is go into his background.  PLEASE Be Careful.

            Now, we have researched ball clubs before.  Imo, they are probably all doing this.  We once researched a football stadium, I think in Detroit, that had a heliport on the roof.  Easy to bring in those trafficked and bring them out.  This is a big business.  Big.

              They have resources we don't even know about.  Keep personal to yourself.  I saw a piece on the news and it said he showed up in his Gold Rolls- Royce and gold Patriots ring.  What class /  Also, he must have felt pretty safe tooling around like that.  Did he not think someone would notice him?  Very surprised he is being charged.  On the news they said the time served for this crime is very short.  I sure hope not.  Another Scumbag.
