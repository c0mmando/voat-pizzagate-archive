<p>2) The Gardens Are Configured As A Pregnant Woman
Let\'s take a closer look at Gardens By the Bay. See graphic <a href="https://imgur.com/caH92YM">here</a>. I\'ve been studying this place for months. My first thought was that it might be in the shape of a woman\'s torso since the <a href="https://cdn.qmap.pub/images/SING_CLAS_P_L2.png">Domed Conservatories</a> have a distinct bra shape. That theory has since been confirmed by the discovery of more key anatomical features. (&quot;Learn the hidden symbolism.&quot;)</p>
<p>If you\'re still not convinced, ponder this spectacular aerial image of the domed conservatories at the Gardens By the Bay <a href="https://twitter.com/archpics/status/1026478767928172547"> on Twitter</a> and someone couldn\'t help but blurt out, &quot;Wow! That\'s one helluva bra!&quot; My initial thoughts exactly upon seeing a picture of them posted on Q, which led me to study this place more.</p>
<p>Upon closer examination of the map, one realizes that there is a spectacular <a href="http://static1.squarespace.com/static/512f9596e4b0ed945e3306aa/t/55cde18ae4b033a227a6dc9d/1439555980920/">Floral Cloc</a>k (&quot;Start the Clock.&quot;) near the Flower Dome, installed by haute horologist Audemars Piguet and modelled after their very popular luxury Royal Oak Offshore watch, a professional diver\'s watch, capable of withstanding ocean depth pressures of up to 300 meters.</p>
<p>The stunning <a href="http://farm7.staticflickr.com/6019/6373150505_77a41641d9_b.jpg">Super Tree Grove</a>, is composed of 12 solar-powered mechanical trees, which generate electricity and power a light and sound show at night. They recycle water and vent air from the conservatories. This grove of giant trees is the anatomical core, or GI tract, of the &quot;body&quot;. (Groves are sacred places in many pagan cultures, the location of sacred rites.)</p>
<p>Below the Super Trees in the Gardens\' &quot;body&quot; is the colossal bronze naked floating baby sculpture,<a href="http://sargasso.nl/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Mark-Pegrum-Planet-by-Marc-Quinn-Gardens-by-the-Bay-Singapore-October-2013-1427581866.jpg"> &quot;The Planet&quot;</a> (&quot;Think children.&quot;) created by avant-garde British sculptor Marc Quinn, who regularly produces macabre art and allegedly <a href="http://www.euronews.com/2018/08/03/gaga-and-marc-quinn-muse-zombie-boy-dies">&quot;discovered</a>&quot; the late Zombie Boy several years ago with Madonna and helped propel him to fame. He made a sculpture of the unfortunate Zombie Boy which will be unveiled next year. The baby sculpture is modelled on Quinn\'s sleeping infant son and creates the illusion that it is floating. Very fitting, since it is in the correct anatomical position for a baby to be floating in utero, so the Gardens By the Bay woman/fertility goddess figure is pregnant. </p>
<p>I have recently discovered that there is <a href="https://farm1.static.flickr.com/499/32744523926_8d7869a721_b.jpg">a long narrow walkway</a> leading from the floating baby statue, surrounded on two sides with thick vegetation. This is obviously the birth canal. No graphic detail forgotten in this Mother Earth/fertility goddess scheme.</p>
<p>3) Much more to say about this mysterious place. There are many Alice in Wonderland-themed sculptures, including <a href="https://www.tilytravels.com/uploads/3/7/7/1/37712685/gardens-by-the-bay-singapore-flower-dome-56_orig.jpg">one</a> of the Queen of Hearts shouting, &quot;Off with her head.&quot; in the Floral Dome conservatory, and the motto of the Gardens is &quot;Where Wonder Blooms.&quot; Singapore itself is saturated with Alice in Wonderland restaurants, including one called The White Rabbit which has this interesting <a href="https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/8303kYtEBOeYZO0t35iILA/348s.jpg">door</a> with the pope\'s tiara and papal keys. I\'m most interested in knowing what lies underneath (&quot;Runs deep.&quot;) the Gardens By the Bay. Singapore has natural cave systems underground (think cave divers) as well as huge man made tunnels, known as the <a href="https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/five-things-to-know-about-the-jurong-rock-caverns">Jurong Caves</a>. There are also traffic tunnels and underwater attractions. It is said that Singapore\'s <a href="http://travel.cnn.com/singapore/none/singapore-underwater-city-future-116383/">underwater city</a> is as vital and active as what is above ground. Also, the Port of Singapore is the second busiest in the world.</p>
<p>Why is Q directing our attention to this lush Garden? Why did Kim visit? What connection does it have to Sheldon Adelson\'s Hotel and the Sky Event?</p>
<p>Does it have some pagan/satanic/cult significance? What is this venue used for? Is it a &quot;slave garden&quot;? Questions abound even more about this beautiful but unmistakably sinister place.</p>',

            There looks to be a uterus and a vagina and the delta of the vulva, but the baby would seem to be floating outside the womb...unless what looks like the womb is actually a very full bladder.  :)

             Great picture. I never saw one like this for some reason. I think you have the floating baby a little too far north. It sits in the open circular area. Maybe this picture was taken before it was installed.

             . The sculpture sits in that open area, literally floating in its amniotic sac.
I know it's all a bit contorted, but it really appears like the basic anatomical features are there.

              This map from Gardens by the Bay shows the "Planet" floating baby in a smaller grassy, not the large circular area:

               Hey, I found a video:
               <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J29qqEkUK7I">
                https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J29qqEkUK7I
               </a>
              </p>
              <p>
               Really shows where exactly this thing is placed in the garden. If you have a chance to watch it, I'd be curious to know what do you think? I think it's in the meadow because it's directly south of the Super Trees, not off to the side. Maybe I'm mistaken, though.

                My take on the video is that the relationship between the round Meadow and the baby is best shown at 0:17, where the baby is off to the right of the sidewalk and the Meadow is not very visible beyond the trees/bushes.  The baby moves in relation to the background as the photographer moves around the baby, thus it is only at a particular point that the baby appears to be directly "south" of the Super Trees.
               </p>
               <p>
                Honestly, what I think is going on here is that when visitors speak of the Meadow, they're including all four of the grassy spaces south of the Super Trees.  Really, as the map shows, the sidewalks artificially divide the grassy space, so if you think of the four grassy spaces together without the sidewalks, the baby would technically be contained in one big grassy womb.

               I think that's just the perspective of the map, so you can see both The Meadow and the statue clearly, but the Gardens By the Bay

                website
               </a>
               says the statue is located in The Meadow. Huffington Post article and artdaily.com and lonelytravelog.com all say it's locate in The Meadow. Another article calls the sculpture  "The Miracle in the Meadow."

               Don't know why I didn't think of this before:  You can "walk" through the Gardens via Google Street View by clicking on the directional arrows or maneuvering the red arrow on the left.  It clearly shows the baby's relationship to the meadow:

            Slave Gardens
           </p>
           <p>
            To supplement basic provisions provided by their master, some bondpeople grew their own foodstuffs and staple crops for personal consumption or sale. Enslaved men and women typically tended these gardens or "patches" after they had finished their daily or weekly work for their master.
           </p>
           <p>
            For some slaves, these gardens provided crucial supplements to an otherwise nutrient-deprived diet. The extent to which bondpeople and their masters relied on slave gardens for basic provisioning depended on the type of labor system employed and the region in which the plantation was situated.

             Thanks for this! I saw this article, but it seems to me that back in February when it first appeared, the article was different and talked about growing people for crops, but maybe that was my imagination.

             Thailand, Myanmar and Singapore are all connected on the same land mass, I believe, something I wasn't sure about till recently when I was reading about the Thai cave rescue. The cave where the boys were lost is near the Golden Triangle area which is a huge smuggling center.

                 I'm sorry, I'm re-reading this again. Just realized you wanted pictures of the images that Q was talking about. I thought you were talking about the images I posted myself. I will fix that now.

                   , I hardly dare mentioning it since you're so delighted now, but...
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   ...would you please be able to add a link to this number: #1450? So that when users will click it, they will be able to go to the Q post in question?
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   Unlike the other Q posts you list - #747, #748 etc., this one doesn't haven't a link.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   We will allow some more time to fix this, and not pull the post. ;-)

                 Hi Think, I thought I'd fixed everything. I don't know what you mean by #1450 not working, since there isn't a #1450 in the article. I checked all of the links to qmap.pub, and they're all working and I made jpgs to all the pictures. Some of the links are to articles so I can't make jpgs of those. I will also remove one of the images of Adelson's hotel, as you suggest. Other than than, I've done everything requested.

            The Securities and Exchange Commission and Department of Justice have been investigating allegations of ties between Sheldon Adelson’s Macau casino and Chinese organized crime rings and prostitution for the past year. ABC News reports a former Sands Casino executive has charged that the Asian business operation relied on the Chinese triads which organized junkets for “high roller” gamblers and prostitution to service their “other” needs. It reports that on the same day Adelson arrived for a major business meeting at the Chinese enclave 100 prostitutes were arrested within the hotel. The charges are being investigated under the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, which governs crimes like corporate bribery.

            Macau Sands AP
LAS VEGAS (AP) — The fired former chief executive of Las Vegas Sands Corp.'s Macau casinos alleges in court documents revealed Thursday that billionaire Sheldon Adelson personally approved of prostitution and knew of other improper activity at his company's properties in the Chinese enclave.
           </p>
           <p>
            Brad Brian, an attorney representing Las Vegas Sands Corp. and Sands China Ltd., called the allegations false and "scurrilous" and claimed they had been included in the civil lawsuit brought by former Sands executive Steven Jacobs only to sensationalize the case.
           </p>
           <p>
            Jacobs was fired in July 2010 from his role overseeing the Macau properties. He sued the companies and Adelson three months later.
           </p>
           <p>
            In the lawsuit, he accuses the company and Adelson of breach of contract and of pushing him into illegal activity in Macau, a former Portugese colony near Hong Kong where Sands has established a strong business presence. The company owns the Venetian Macao and Sands Macao casino resorts, the Plaza Macao hotel, restaurant and shopping complex and the newly opened Sands Cotai Central resort with three hotels and two casinos.
           </p>
           <p>
            In documents revealed Thursday — including a sworn seven-page declaration that Jacobs submitted along with a summary from his attorneys of problems obtaining documents from Sands — Jacobs describes an effort he launched after arriving in Macau in May 2009 to rid the casino floor of "loan sharks and prostitution."
           </p>
           <p>
            "This project was met with concern as (company) senior executives informed me that the prior prostitution strategy had been personally approved by Adelson," Jacobs said in the documents.
           </p>
           <p>
            I have not found anything regarding the Gardens by the Bay, but Adelson has connections to the Chinese Mafia evidently, and has been rumored to allow prostitution in his hotels.  There is a good chance it is occurring at GBTB in Singapore as well.  Possibly underage even.

             Hi Carmencita! Long time no see! I hope you're doing well. Super comment here. I was hoping someone would have more information on Sheldon Adelson. It's very interesting how his hotel which figures largely in the Q posts, and was one famous place Kim Jung-Un visited before the Kim-Trump Summit) directly overlooks the Gardens. Who would have thought that hotels would become such places of interest? I never thought about them before except as playgrounds for the rich and famous, but perhaps a lot of cuckery goes on in them.
            </p>
            <p>
             What I find most intriguing about Adelson's Marina Sands hotel complex wasn't the hotel, but the futuristic lotus-shaped
             <a href="http://media.gettyimages.com/photos/marina-bay-sands-art-science-museum-picture-id469446127?s=170667a">
              Art and Science Museum
             </a>
             next to it which is across from the Gardens By the Bay: Very impressive---it's a lotus but

              it's shaped like a hand
             </a>
             . Sheldon Adelson

              refer

             s to it as "The Welcoming Hand of Singapore"
            </p>
            <p>
             What's most fascinating is that the base is submerged under the waters of the bay, so it's highly possible it has underwater access, a convenient feature for nefarious purposes, one might imagine.

             the base is surrounded and submerged by water.
            </p>
            <p>
             This is all related of course to the nature of lotus flowers, whose roots are buried deep in the mud of a calm water source.
            </p>
            <p>
             The Lotus Flower has deep religious/cultural symbolism: With its roots buried in the mud, the lotus flower rises through the murky water to blossom clean and bright, symbolizing rebirth, resurrection and cleansing. It goes through a continuous cycle of rising, basking in the sun and sinking.
            </p>
            <p>
             I'm sure there could be other meanings for it as well. What I most want to discover is if there's an underwater connection between the Gardens By the Bay, Sheldon Adelson's hotel and the Art Science Museum. Because Singapore has such an extensive underwater network, this wouldn't be implausible at all. It's also highly convenient that the Port of Singapore is a handy distance away.
            </p>
            <p>
             Thanks again for the information on Adelson and his possible connection to the Chinese Mafia.. I think more study might prove very beneficial.

              Hi Yourself!  I have posted about this many times and it has gone nowhere, but I propose a look into Mitch McConnell and his wife, Elaine Chao.   The wife's father died a while ago and she inherited his ships.  In the past one or two were caught drug trafficking.  Loaded with drugs.  They travel all over the world.  Sorry, forgot to mention that she is Chinese.  This is a very large shipping co. and they are very wealthy.  For what it's worth, I think it would be highly possible they are also involved in human trafficking.  AND I would not be surprised if Adelson is using their services.  I ask where do all those prostitutes come from?  Not all the elite prefer Chinese.  They get there somehow.
             </p>

              Before the Ping May, a rusty cargo vessel, could disembark from the port of Santa Marta en route to the Netherlands in late August, Colombian inspectors boarded the boat and made a discovery. Hidden in the ship’s chain locker, amidst its load of coal bound for Europe, were approximately 40 kilograms, or about ninety pounds, of cocaine. A Colombian Coast Guard official told The Nation that there is an ongoing investigation.
             </p>
             <p>
              The seizure of the narcotics shipment in the Caribbean port occurred far away from Kentucky, the state in which Senator Mitch McConnell is now facing a career-defining election. But the Republican Senate minority leader has the closest of ties to the owner of the Ping May, the vessel containing the illicit materials: the Foremost Maritime Corporation, a firm founded and owned by McConnell’s in-laws, the Chao family.

               Holy smokes. I didn't suspect that of old Mitch, but something has to account for his swampy behavior. This is really damning information. If only he would resign, too, and Trump could have real support in Congress.
              </p>
              <p>
               I'm also trying to find out more about Sheldon Adelson and the Chinese Mafia. I thought Adelson was supposed to be an ally of
               <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/user/POTUS">
                @POTUS
               </a>
               which is why it was strange to see Q post pictures of the Marina Sands Bay hotel. What was the symbolism of Kim visiting the Flower Dome at the Gardens By the Bay and of him standing on top of Adelson's Hotel? He was liberated and free to travel abroad, but is there something more? Did he and Trump's white hats break up the Cabal that was using Gardens By the Bay and Marina Bay Sands Hotel. Was it a symbolic gesture that they had defeated the Chinese mafia/globalist trafficking networks?

                Very odd about Kim at the Gardens.  May just have been there to take in the scenery or make a deal with Adelson.  Who knows.  Visiting a prostitute?  He is no holy roller.  He is an elite as well.

                Casino magnate Sheldon Adelson, the biggest Republican donor in the 2012 election, has come under new scrutiny for possible violations of federal anti-bribery law and ties to Chinese organized crime. The potential violations stem from Adelson’s efforts to build casinos and other projects in Macau. An investigation by the University of California, ProPublica and PBS Frontline found Adelson may have violated the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act when he instructed a top executive to give $700,000 to a Macau legislator who aided his company’s efforts there. Officials are also probing possible ties between Adelson’s company, Las Vegas Sands, and Chinese organized crime. The projects in Macau helped Adelson amass a personal fortune estimated at $25 billion. He has given tens of millions of dollars to Newt Gingrich, Mitt Romney and other Republican causes, and has spoken of spending upwards of $100 million to defeat President Obama’s re-election.

                Rahm Emanuel who is also Jewish and connected to the Mossad as is Adelson, well Emanuel has Red Chinese connections as well.  They are all connected.  I wish I could see your eyes pop out when you read this link.

                There is more than Rahm and the Chinese, but this really opened my eyes even wider.

                 GREAT article you linked to above. Very interesting about the organ trafficking of political prisoners by the Chinese. I wonder if that's why Pope Francis sold the Chinese Catholics down the river so they would be sent to prison camps where they could be easily harvested and trafficked? Makes one wonder.

                 Also, the claim that Rahm Emmanuel's family assassinated Count Bernadotte is HUGE. I have long been interested in the 1948 events in Israel and the string of assassinations. US diplomat Thomas Wasson and Count Bernadotte advocated the Two-State solution, I believe, and wanted to stop the exile and genocide of Palestinians by Israel.

                 This is great work, Carmencita. I've been wondering about Sheldon Adelson for a while, mainly because Q has posted several pictures of his hotel. Not only powerful Jews are connected with Chi Coms, but also the Vatican and the Jesuits. I've been following Gordon C. Chang, an expert on China, who believes that China is having huge internal problems and if Trump will only push them a little bit more on tariffs, the Communist regime could collapse. That would be enormous. I wonder if they go down, will Pope Francis go down with him?

                  OMG. The Fall of the Vatican would be Awesome. I totally believe they are all working together. Remember John Ash and the Chinese guy connected to the Clintons?  He died a day before testifying whenbarbell fell on his throat.  Chinese are Big Players.
