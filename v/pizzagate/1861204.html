<p>The Child Mind Institute states on its website that it has no affiliations to pharmaceutical companies but a brief investigation blows that claim out of the water.  This article, <a href="http://www.alternet.org/personal-health/how-kids-are-getting-hooked-pills-life">How Kids Are Getting Hooked on Pills for Life</a>, indicates their association with <strong>GlaxoSmithKline</strong> and we will soon see affiliations with other big pharma companies.  As they have a <em>biological psychiatry</em> approach to mental health that is no surprise.</p>

<p>Mr. Ram Sundaram has been Head of Fixed Income Currency &amp; Commodities Latin America Trading at <strong>Goldman, Sachs &amp; Co.</strong> since April 2012 and serves as its Global Head of Principal Funding &amp; Investment.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Mr. Sundaram is not without controversy: <a href="http://archives.cjr.org/the_audit/post_27.php">The Wall Street End Game</a> </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Mr. Sundaram’s trades represented another large part of Goldman’s business with A.I.G. ACCORDING TO FIVE FORMER GOLDMAN EMPLOYEES, Mr. Sundaram used financing from other banks like Société Générale and Calyon to purchase less risky mortgage securities from competitors like Merrill Lynch and then insure the assets with A.I.G. — helping fatten the mortgage pipeline that would prove so harmful to Wall Street, investors and taxpayers. In October 2008, just after A.I.G. collapsed, Goldman made Mr. Sundaram a partner.</p>

In April to May 2002, plaintiff had the responsibility to schedule a meeting between Dr. Schlessinger and the Director of the Cancer Center. Dr. Schlessinger became angry because of a decision a committee made to reject his preferred candidate for that position. When plaintiff discussed with the scheduling of a meeting, he answered, “F*** them, I am not meeting with them”. Surprised, the plaintiff responded in question form, “F*** them?”.  Dr. Schlessinger responded, “I bet it would be fun to f**** you.”  At this point, plaintiff became fearful and left the room.</p>

            PART I
           </p>
           <p>
            Hillary Clinton and John Podesta. John Podesta was the White House chief of staff under President Bill Clinton, the official adviser to President Obama, and now president of Hillary Clinton's campaign. In 1988, John Podesta and his brother, Anthony Podesta, established the Podesta Group lobby firm. Podesta Group received $ 150,000 from Monsanto last year through another lobbying firm called Wilmer Cutler Pickering Hale &amp; Dorr LLP.
           </p>
           <p>
            The Podesta Group also served the Biotechnology Innovation Organization (BIO) - an organization funded by the transgenic industry. They paid $ 90,000.00 so far in 2016 for the Podesta Group. You have one brother lobbying at the White House while the other manages the firm.
           </p>
           <p>
            The Clintons and Monsanto
CNN reported a while ago about the Clinton Foundation and outlined the relationship between that organization and Monsanto. She says that Monsanto gave between one and five million dollars to the Clinton Foundation. Hilary Clinton, the current presidential candidate, and her husband, Bill Clinton, own this "NGO."
Watch the video at the link below:
            <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOHycY_TEpA&amp;feature=youtu.be">
             https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOHycY_TEpA&amp;feature=youtu.be
            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            The close relationship between the Clinton family and Monsanto comes as no surprise. It began in the 1980s when Monsanto was a client of the Hillary Clinton law firm Rose Law Firm in Arkansas. [1] During the presidency of Bill Clinton as US president (1993-2001), he appointed Robert Shapiro, Monsanto's president, to the President's Advisory Committee on Trade Policy. This executive committee of the US government worked together with Mickey Kantor - US Trade Representative (1993-1996) and Secretary of Commerce (1996-1997), who became a member of Monsanto's board in 1997. [15,18]
           </p>
           <p>
            In 1993, Bill Clinton also appointed Rufus Yersa as US Deputy Trade Representative. [21] Rufus Yersa left the Clinton administration in 1995 to go to law firm Akin, Gump, Strauss, Hauer &amp; Feld in Bruxelles, Belgium. This company has Monsanto as its client. From 1998 to 2002, Rufus Yersa went to work for Monsanto. In 2002, he was appointed Deputy Director General of the World Trade Organization (WTO). [22] Monsanto now has its own staff member at the WTO who can always partially judge any international trade action against countries that bar GMOs under the precautionary principle. Mr. Yerxa is the top head of the legal affairs division at the WTO, which in a number of ways can influence the instance and if a panel goes ahead on GMO matters - including involvement in panel selection, advisory Legal advice to the panelists, advice on the identification and selection of scientific "experts" in the case. [20] He was Deputy Director General of the WTO until 2013.
           </p>
           <p>
            In 1993, during the first year of the presidency of Bill Clinton, the hormone Recombinant Bovine Somatoprine (rBST) was approved. This hormone is used in cows to increase milk production but is banned in dozens of countries for human and / or animal health risks - including Japan, the European Union, Canada, Australia and New Zealand. This hormone is associated with several types of cancers due to the high level of IGF-1 and other diseases. [38]
In Brazil, MPF in Pará attempted to ban this product, but the federal government, through the Federal Attorney General's Office, pressured the case judge to close the case in 2012. [59] MPF mentioned cancer risks, more antibiotic residues In milk and until the development of diabetes, type 2. [43]
           </p>
           <p>
            In 1994, Bill Clinton appointed attorney Michael Taylor to work at the Department of Agriculture. Michael Taylor worked for King &amp; Spalding between 1981-1991, which had Monsanto as one of its clients. Michael Taylor is accused of having influenced Monsanto's rBST approval by the US government and the non-labeling of milk from cows treated with this transgenic hormone while working at the FDA between 1991-1994. In 1996, Michael Taylor went to work for Monsanto as Vice President of Public Policy. [19]
           </p>
           <p>
            Also in 1994, Bill Clinton appointed Virginia Weldon, Vice President of Public Policy at Monsanto, to serve on the US President's Advisory Committee on Science and Technology. She was also appointed to the National Advisory Committee on Agricultural Biotechnology. [25,26] Lidia Watrud, a former microbial biotechnology researcher at Monsanto, went to work for the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) - the equivalent of IBAMA in Brazil. [27]
           </p>
           <p>
            The Clinton administration has also lobbied governments to open up their markets for the importation and introduction of transgenic plants in their countries. For example, Vice President Al Gore and his Secretary of State Medeleine Albright pressed Prime Minister Lionel Jospin of France to approve the import of a variety of GM corn from Monsanto. Lionel Jospin accepted in 1998. [15]
           </p>
           <p>
            Also in 1998, Bill Clinton awarded the National Medal of Technology to Monsanto officials Ernest Jaworski, Robert Fraley, Robert Horsh and Stephen Rogers. These four invented Monsanto's Roundup Ready transgenic soybeans. Nowadays, Stephan Rogers and Ernest Rogers retired while Robert Fraley became Vice President and Chief Technology Officer of Monsanto and Robert Horsch went to work for the Melinda &amp; Gates Foundation in the area of transgenics.
           </p>
           <p>
            This foundation gave $ 25 million to the Clinton Foundation. [39]
The Melinda &amp; Gates Foundation annually invests a lot of money in the development of transgenic cassava ($ 27 million), sorghum ($ 21 million), sweet babata ($ 41 million), wheat, oats and transgenic rice ($ 10 million), lobbying poor governments To accept the introduction of transgenics in their countries, and to fund pro-transgenic propaganda projects and events, such as the Cornell University's Cornell University for Science, to influence public opinion on this subject. [41,42,55] A partner of the Cornell Alliance for Science is the International Service for the Acquisition of Agri-biotech Applications (ISAAA) - an organization funded by Monsanto, Bayer, Croplife, etc. [41] The Gates Foundation also has many partnerships with Monsanto, Dupont, etc., for the development of transgenics in Africa.

            Just as Bill Clinton was hiring a lot of Monsanto people in the upper echelon of his administration, many were leaving to go to work for Monsanto after working for the Clinton administration for some years. As I mentioned earlier, Mickey Kantor and Rufus Yersa had gone to work at Monsanto or lobbying companies that had this company as a client. Now join this list also Marcia Hale, Michael A. Friedman M.D. and Joshua King. Marcia Hale was Bill Clinton's personal adviser and director for intergovernmental affairs at the White House and went to work as the Director of International Affairs at the Monsanto Government. [27,28] Michael A. Friedman M.D, an FDA director, equivalent to ANVISA in Brazil, has been vice president of Searle - a division of Monsanto. [27.29] Finally, Joshua King, Director of Presidential Events at the White House, became Director of International Government Relations at Monsanto. [27, 30]
           </p>
           <p>
            In 2000, Bill Clinton appointed Monsanto lobbyist Carol Tucker Foreman as the consumer representative to work on an international commission whose aim is to reconcile the differences between the United States and the rest of the world on the subject of food that has been genetically modified . [23] Even though it is a "consumer representative", it says that the mandatory labeling of food products that have been genetically modified is frivolous. One reason for Foreman to be against labeling is that it could drastically shrink the OGMS food market. [24] Carol Foreman worked on the subject of rBST as a Monsanto lobbyist. [24]
           </p>
           <p>
            After Bill Clinton left the White House in 2002, the Clinton-Monsanto relationship continued or even deepened through the Clinton Foundation, and when Hillary Clinton was Secretary of State during the first term of the Obama administration. Let's look at some examples:
           </p>
           <p>
            1) When she was Secretary of State during the first term of the Obama administration, she helped to promote the USAID program called "Feed the Future." This program is a partnership between USAID, the GM industry and agribusiness, including Monsanto, Du Pont, Syngenta, Cargill, to "reduce hunger in the world" - especially in Africa. And to open new markets to transnational corporations than to "reduce hunger in the world." [11, 51, 52] USAID's relations with the GM industry are also deep and old: USAID has a number of transgenic research partnerships with Monsanto in Africa, lobbies these countries to open up the market for transgenic crops, and funds local biotechnology organizations and scientists to pressure governments to pass legislation to facilitate GM research and trade liberalization. [11,52,52]
           </p>
           <p>
            2) The Clinton Global Initiative (CGI) promotes Monsanto's Roundup pesticide and its transgenic seeds. Huge Grant, president of Monsanto, spoke at the Clinton Global Initiative Conference in 2014. [3]
           </p>
           <p>
            3) In 2014, at a biotechnology conference in San Diego, Hillary talked about how she supports transgenic seeds and how to improve the image of these products to the public. She also said she was in favor of subsidizing, cutting taxes and even the government helping biotech companies to have "risk insurance." [1,9] Finally, she spoke about how she tried to promote transgenesis in Africa when she was Secretary of State. [31] She received $ 335,000.00 for speaking at that event, which was paid by the Biotechnology International Organization (BIO). That same group had previously paid $ 175,000 to Bill Clinton to also speak at their event in 2010 when Hilllary Clinton was still Secretary of State. Since his wife was Secretary of State, he had an agreement between the Clintons and Obama that all of Bill Clinton's lectures would be reviewed by a State Department ethics group to avoid any conflict of interest. Ironically, in 2009, State Department officials freed Bill Clinton to speak at the BIO event, at the same time as that organization was lobbying the State Department to be against the possibility of an international regulation for transgenics. BIO is funded by the transgenic industry.

           <blockquote>
            <blockquote>
             <p>
              4) All Hillary Cinton's election campaigns are always infested by Monsanto lobbyists. Advisor to her campaign was the Secretary of State, the 2008 presidential campaign, and the two times she ran for Senator Mark Penn. He represented Monsanto through his public relations firm, Burson-Marsteller. [9] The first time she ran for the US presidency in 2008, she was also supported by a group called Rural Americans for Hillary. This organization has close relations with Monsanto. [5.9]

           <p>
            Already, Hillary Clinton's presidential campaign advisor Jerry Crawford has been a lobbyist for Monsanto for years and works for a campaign fund called Hillary Ready (Ready for Hillary Super Pac). [2,3] Journalist Carey Gilliam, a former Reuters journalist, says his company, Crawford, Quilty &amp; Mauro, received sixty thousand dollars from Monsanto in the last quarter of 2015. It is based on a Crawford lobby form, Quilty &amp; Mauro required by the Lobbying Disclosure Act of 1995, [13,14] The website opensecrets.org says that his firm received $ 240,000 last year from Monsanto and $ 180,000 so far in 2016. [16,17] Looking at that same site from previous years, Crawford made on average $ 240,000- $ 300,000 annually with Monsanto.

            PART 3
           </p>
           <p>
            Hillary Clinton also has close ties with lobby firm Akin Gump Strauss Hauer &amp; Feld. Monsanto is one of its main customers. Her campaign treasurer, Joseph H. Villareal, is a consultant to the company and provides strategic advice to clients of the firm on a range of legal and policy issues affecting these clients. Prior to becoming a consultant to Akin Gump, Mr. Villarreal was a longtime associate with Akin Gump, according to the firm's website; [56] Others say that he works for the lobby sector of this firm, but is not registered as a lobbyist. [33]
           </p>
           <p>
            When Hillary Clinton was still Secretary of State, she nominated this individual as US General Commissioner for the Shanghai World Expo in 2010. [37] Imagine an individual who works or provides advisory services to a lobbying firm representing the government at an international trade event. If she wins the election, she'll probably give him a cabinet job for him.
Akin Gump Strauss Hauer &amp; Feld recently said that their firm received more than $ 150,000 from Monsanto since the last quarter of 2015 for issues related to biotechnology regulation in India, among other things. [32]
           </p>
           <p>
            The firm says it has lobbied for Monsanto in the US Senate, the US Congress, the State Department and the Commerce Department for matters related to India during the second quarter of 2016. On the last note on gains made by representing Monsanto in the second half By the firm, ended June 30, was $ 50,000.00. [32]
           </p>
           <p>
            This lobby firm made $ 560,000.00 last year, representing four companies in the transgenic industry (BIO, $ 80,000, Dow, $ 190,000, Monsanto, $ 200,000, Syngenta, $ 90,000). [35]
The pro-transgenic BIO group paid $ 8,000,000.00 in lobbying each year while the Trans-Pacific Partnership Agreement (TPP) was being negotiated. They paid $ 80,000 annually to governments to secure patent protection clauses for transgenic plants and facilitate the entry of transgenics into the signatory countries' markets. [36] Akin Group receives an average of $ 200,000 a year from Monsanto several years ago, according to opensecrets.org.
The third lobbyist group, which is most associated not only with Hillary Clinton but also Bill Clinton, is the Podesta Group. The Podesta Group was created by John Podesta and his brother, Anthony Podesta, known as Tony Podesta in 1988. This must be the most influential of all lobbying groups in Washington because John Podesta was chief of staff of the White House under President Bill Clinton, an official adviser to President Obama, and now president of Hillary Clinton's campaign. [46,49,50]
           </p>
           <p>
            It appears in government documents in 2015 that the Podesta Group received $ 150,000 from Monsanto through Wilmer Cutler Pickering Hale &amp; Dorr LLP. Podesta Group charged $ 150,000 for the service (Second Quarter 2015, $ 60,000, Third Quarter, $ 90,000). [44,45] Monsanto's $ 150,000 amount given to the Podesta Group is also shown at opensecrets.org. [47] In addition, BIO, an organization funded by the transgenic industry, gave $ 90,000.00 so far in 2016 to the Podesta Group. [48]
           </p>
           <p>
            A four lobbyist is Steve Eldmendorf. He owns Eldmendorf Ryan and received $ 60,000 from Monsanto last year through the Wilmer Cutler Pickering Hale and Dorr LLP. [57,58] Steve Eldmendorf also serves the Grocery Manufacturers Association against mandatory labeling of GM foods. [13] The Grocery Manufacturers Association is an association of food companies. Monsanto is a member of this organization.
           </p>
           <p>
            It has to be emphasized that lobby firms that are actively trying to elect Hillary Clinton - Podesta Group, Crawford, Quilty &amp; Mauro and Akin Gump Strauss Hauer &amp; Feld, Ryan Eldmendorf - also help raise funds for her election campaign. [2,13,33]
           </p>
           <p>
            5) The fame of Hillary's connection with Monsanto and the GM industry is so well known that she was dubbed the Bride of Frakensten in the run-up to the Democratic presidential election this year in Iowa. When Hillary's women voters heard of Hillary's connection to the GM industry in that state, the bulk decided to support Bernie Sanders, according to the Washington Times. [6]
           </p>
           <p>
            6) As Secretary of State, Hillary Clinton promoted 45 times the TPP (Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership), according to CNN. TPP is a trade agreement involving twelve countries (Australia, Brunei, Canada, Japan, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand, Peru, Singapore, Vietnam and the United States.) Although this agreement covers more than 40% TPP is the first trade agreement to include special clauses on transgenics, TPP encourages the export of GMOs, threatens to make GMO labeling illegal, and TPP should ratify the 1991 International Convention for the Protection of New Varieties of Plants, known as UOPV 91.
           </p>
           <p>
            UPOV 91 gives seed companies broad rights to plant varieties and prohibits farmers and breeders from saving and exchanging protected seeds - common practices for farmers around the world. It also allows companies to patent varieties of traditional crops and imposes sanctions on farmers who breach seed license agreements. The TPP will force Brunei, Chile, Malaysia, Mexico and New Zealand to ratify UPOV 91. [53]
           </p>
           <p>
            The biotechnology industry organization (BIO), which was funded by the transgenic industry, was an official adviser to the US government. BIO spent $ 8 million in lobbying every year that the TPP was being negotiated to ensure special rights and protection for the GM industry. [53]
As the US Chief Negotiator for Agricultural Affairs of this agreement said at the BIO conference in 2016, "For the first time, we have specific language on biotech farming in the TPP." The U.S. Trade Representative said the United States is actively engaged with its trading partners to remove unwarranted trade barriers on GMOs. [53]
           </p>
           <p>
            Another negative aspect of this agreement, as well as the TTIP (the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership), an agreement similar to the TPP being negotiated between the US and the European Community, is that it has a legal clause called Investor - state Dispute Settlement or ISDS , Which leaves companies to sue sovereign governments, before ad hoc arbitration tribunals, for losses of profit resulting from public policies. [12]
Representatives from both sides acknowledge that TTIP's primary objective is not to stimulate trade by removing customs duties between the EU and the US, as these rates are already minimal. The main purpose of TTIP, the authorities admit, is to remove regulatory "barriers" that restrict the potential profit margin of transnational corporations on both sides of the Atlantic. However, such
"Barriers" actually represent some of our most valuable tools for protecting social standards and environmental regulations, such as labor rights, food safety rules (including restrictions on genetically modified organisms), regulations on the use of chemicals Toxic, digital privacy laws and even
Bank guarantees introduced to avoid a repeat of the 2008 financial crisis.
This mechanism for resolving disputes between investors and states effectively raises transnational capital to a level equivalent to that of a nation-state and threatens to undermine the most basic principles of democracy. [12] This "Investor-state Dispute Settlement" (ISDS) is unique in its implications, since it raises transnational capital to a legal level equivalent to that of a nation-state. According to the TTIP, therefore, American and European corporations would have the power to question decisions made by sovereign states, demanding indemnities whenever these decisions have
Adverse effects on their profit margins.

            PART 4
           </p>
           <p>
            The arbitration courts themselves are a complete farce. Arbitrators are not sitting judges with public authority, as would be the case in national judicial systems, but rather a small group of corporate lawyers appointed ad hoc and prone to making business-friendly judgments. Courts meet secretly and Arbitrators have already been accused of so many incorrect applications of the law, that even those favorable to international arbitration, admit
That the idea has already lost all its credibility. A public statement, signed by more than 50 law professors and other academics, demanded that the system be abolished and the right of decision returned to the national courts.
           </p>
           <p>
            When included in bilateral investment treaties or other free trade agreements, ISDS has caused considerable damage to public policies and democracy. Some of the most notable examples include:
           </p>
           <p>
            1) The Swedish company Vattenfall is demanding from the German government a compensation of € 3.7 billion due to the official policy of gradually reducing the use of nuclear energy as a result of the Fukushima disaster. Vattenfall had previously been successful in the city of Hamburg, as their complaints led to a loosening of the city's environmental standards.
           </p>
           <p>
            2) In the first of many ISDS cases filed against Canada under NAFTA, a complaint by the American company Ethyl led the Canadian government to repeal the ban on the MMT fuel additive. In a later case concerning water and wood use rights, Canada was required to pay $ 122 million to the Canadian firm AbitibiBowater, a paper manufacturer with an office in the United States, and was using NAFTA to process its own government.
           </p>
           <p>
            3) Cigarette giant Phillip Morris is suing the Australian government for billions of dollars because of the official health policy, which dictates that cigarettes should be sold in plain packaging. Phillip Morris is also suing Uruguay over official anti-smoking measures, according to which anti-smoking illustrations are expected to cover 80 percent of the surface of cigarette packs sold in the country.
           </p>
           <p>
            4) No State was more affected by cases of ISDS than Argentina, especially due to the end of the fixed exchange policy in 2002. In October 2013, after many years of judicial battle, the Argentine government was forced to indemnify five companies In more than 500 million dollars.
           </p>
           <p>
            5) Ecuador was ordered to pay Occidental Petroleum $ 1.77 billion - the highest amount ever paid in an ISDS case - for breaking the contract with the oil giant when it violated Ecuadorian law. However, a special court denied Ecuador a $ 19 billion compensation that was to be paid by Chevron for two decades of Amazonian forest contamination.

            The drugging of children, even infants  as young as three months old, who allegedly have "bi-polar disorder" continues apace.
           </p>
           <p>
            Children are drugged to control "behavior". In the classroom, "undesirable behavior" is treated with toxic psychotropic drugs, when the children are actually suffering aftereffects of trauma or micro-nutrient deficiency caused by GMO and glyphosate laden food.
           </p>
           <p>

            These drugs literally change consciousness at the very least.
           </p>
           <p>
            There is hope, in the form of ingesting essential micro-nutrients -proven to work for over 20 years in hundreds of thousands of people who got off psychotropic drugs but you will not likely hear about it in the MSM:

            It is interesting how you close this..I am a researcher and have played around with building aphrodisiac's...for adults BTW.  Absolutely correct that serotonine channel is a ripe target.  Lots of crazy things you can do to a human by playing with this channel.  VERY good work!

            can't sleep -- Thank you for this amazing report which I wasn't able to give all the attention it deserved and hope to come back to shortly.
           </p>
           <p>
            But, if I may, I just wanted to add that we began to see some very serious damage being done to children in the 1970's with the increased vaccines being administered -- though parents didn't realize it at the time, though school nurses were watching "hyperactivity" rise among students and "toe walking" was something that entered our vocabulary as a new oddity among children.
           </p>
           <p>
            Classrooms suddenly could be disrupted by even one child and very quickly it seemed that child was being put on drugs -- or that was at the least being suggested to the parents.
           </p>
           <p>
            I really think the opening for this "putting kids on drugs" really is the increased vaccine schedule.
           </p>
           <p>
            And looking back even earlier now than the 70's, those researching vaccines are linking many of our old diseases and problems with vaccines -- from Sudden Death Syndrome and Colic and Projectile Spitting -- to these vaccines.
            <a href="https://www.shirleys-wellness-cafe.com/Vaccines/VaccineSids">
             https://www.shirleys-wellness-cafe.com/Vaccines/VaccineSids
            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            I'd point out that we also see in various studies that researchers have made clear a parallel between Schizophrenia and Autism which could connect both to vaccines -- in one case Autism shows an under-pruning of the synapses, while Schizophrenia shows an over-pruning of the synapses.  In other words brain damage (and damage to the GI tract) from damage to the genes.
See:  New Yorker article . . . 
Runs in the Family
            <a href="http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2016/03/28/the-genetics-of-schizophrenia">
             http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2016/03/28/the-genetics-of-schizophrenia
            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            Granted that Schizophrenia has long been with us  - long before the vaccines -- however, so have men been digging up metals from the earth for all of that time.  Doctors have used cleansing methods to remove metals and other poisonous substances from the bodies of children with Autism with very positive results.  Many of those doctors have died under strange circumstances.

            And while I don't have a link to the original article I read about pedophiles using drugs on children ...
this link tells something of the story -- 
the desire to incapacitate the child -- 
but I've also read that many pedophiles find it impossible to sexually assault a child
unless they, themselves, are taking drugs.
