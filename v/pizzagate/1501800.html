            I don't trust anything since mid October.  Once the police stopped staking him out, we haven't seen him.  He's definitely not at the embassy and the tweets since then have been inconsistent with what we've seen from WL.

              There was an audio interview with Sean Hannity on Fox News but it was audio only. There was something "off" about it - timing, audio, something.  It's better than nothing but certainly not proof of life.  I believe Julian said if there was ever any doubt that he wasn't safe, he'd appear at the window.  All "evidence" says he's no longer at the embassy.

             Ditto, can't wait for my ISP to put me on the no-fly list. Can't these ppl do with something useful with a 4gb sample download??
            </p>
            <p>
             I mean who the fuck has the ability without a major problem with their ISP to download 100 gb on one file?

             Maybe university's or ppl with high bandwidth, but how many people can really download something like this and add-in that most likely you will never get the 'key' as its an insurance file, meaning its a lead brick until you get a key, if ever.
            </p>
            <p>
             Let's also be honest if they were delivering CP ( evidence ) that still be a crime in most country's and thus even though U didn't have the key you would still be in 'possession', this is an incredible can of worms.

             This is most likely a test as few will bite, but in the future if the GOV wanted to justify shutting down massive ISP users, all they would have to do is dump a file like this encrypted with CP.

             Given we haven't heard from Assange a month+ most likely this file is just stuff that was floating around a long time ago when they first starting dumping their insurance.

            <p>
             We were told long ago that Assange was busted and his team was busted, all houses busted all servers grabbed, and that Assange was drugged the dead-mans switch stopped and most likely Assange dead,

             Can't wait to see? Most likely more bullshit, as that seems to be what is on the plate.

              Ironically, google fiber gives me no qualms about downloading such a big file. And no, I will not be one to download it, lol.

              Yeah it's just so suspicious that JA hasn't been out on the balcony. Someone replied to WL's tweet about this file and said they thought they were compromised, and WL account says that the story about Assange being grabbed and everything busted and CIA taking over WL operations is just a made up story by agencies to stop people trusting WL.
             </p>
             <p>
              It's so unbelievably dumb though. SO dumb, I can't actually believe these people work for 'intelligence' agencies. Because the only way that story would work to make people distrust WL is if at the same time there was no real certain proof that JA was alive and still at the embassy. I.e, the only way the CIA could get people to distrust WL by making people think JA was kidnapped/dead etc is if it's actually true, and he's not coming out to prove them wrong and prove that Wikileaks can still be trusted. Which he obviously would do. Unless they are preventing him from coming onto the balcony because they've got a friend or relative of his and are threatening to kill them if he gives 100% undeniable POL.
             </p>
             <p>
              Fuck I don't know. I think it's likely that WL is over. Apparently the police presence at the embassy has disappeared as well now, which is a bit of a sign if true. :-(
