            Alex Jones complains about "globalists" all day, with his favorite background of a SPINNING GLOBE behind him.
           </p>
           <p>
            I will admit that AJ had woken up many people who would otherwise still be watching MSM, but I still believe him to be disinfo/half truths/truth and lies.
           </p>
           <p>
            Given the level of deception and symbolism uncovered with PizzaGate, I highly recommend researching Flat Earth, because we've been lied to.  I'm not saying I know the exact shape of the earth or how it all works, but there is NOT enough evidence to prove their claims of a spinning ball in space.  It's CGI cartoon representations, every time, all the time.
           </p>
           <p>
            If you don't believe me, Google "pictures of earth from space" and come back and tell me which one is the real one.  Because they are all cartoons, and they all debunk each other.  Like the third image that comes up has "sex" written in the photoshopped clouds.
           </p>
           <p>
            Once I realized how satanic the spinning globe was, especially given the hypnotic effects, I could not watch Alex Jones anymore.  He is worse than MSM when it comes to using that hypnotic shit, and I wish people would stop thinking the effects on our brains are negligible.  It's subliminal programming, and we should avoid it as much as possible.

             I am on the fence about him, but sometimes the guy puts out some stuff that shows he's connected to some good sources. He's been red pilled so long and so hard that it's made him over the top. He's hard to listen to. I feel he's still genuine in his fight against the global Elite. I do what I used to do with the MSM, I pick multiple sources and put things together, as we all should.

              That's probably a lot of it for me that he's hard to listen to.  He sounds like O'Reilly to me, and I hate O'Reilly.
             </p>
             <p>
              He's just so angry, and I think he does incite anger, or at least high blood pressure in people.

             <p>
              I agree with multiple sources.  Putting all our faith in only a few "trusted authorities" is what got us in trouble in the first place.

            OP, you're arguing over a label and semantics. I get that people are sometimes rightfully a bit suspicious about Jones...but please read between the lines.
           </p>
           <p>
            The problem is that Pizzagate is a very bad and imprecise label. When people like Jones use it, the media tries to act as if truthers are implying that there are Hillary's child sex slaves inside some pizza restaurant, and that's the only issue. Compounding this is that Alefantis is threatening to sue Jones.
           </p>
           <p>
            It should really be called Pedogate: an organized system of child trafficking and political control by elites. That avoids the lawsuit threats and more accurately describes the issue. Jones still is investigating Pedogate and is onboard with that and that's a much better label to summarize the issue.

              I get what you're saying. I think many are just pointing out that's very easy for the Rachel Madcow's of the world to spin "pizzagate" as just a conspiracy about 1 lone restaurant and ignore the wider implications. We've seen gross sex crimes in every arena of power before (media, advertising, sports, religion, and government) and calling it "pizzagate" makes it easy for the establishment to spin away as just a conspiracy theory about a restaurant.
             </p>
             <p>
              Anyway, I don't know what the answer is because the label is also pretty attention getting and powerful as well...I wish Trump would make a tweet and give it one of his patented brand names.

               Colbert was the worst if you ask me.  The way he said "PizzaGate," and the way the fake laugh track audience thought he was so funny.  It's subliminally programming people, making them think this is how most people feel about a topic..  It definitely hurts our cause, but I agree it's a memorable name.
              </p>
              <p>
               But my mom knows PedoGate and PizzaGate, and sadly I still don't think we can get people to care that much who have no experience with trauma or abuse.
              </p>
              <p>
               My family didn't want to talk about or hear about it, until I bitch slap reminded them that I'm a victim.  It's just so uncomfortable for most people, and it's hard to rally people behind an issue that has never affected them.  But you would think of any of them, this should be the one we all take seriously.
              </p>
              <p>
               Given the implications of organ harvesting, I think that one should have its own title.  They aren't just sex trafficking.  To me, it sounds like they could literally be growing humans in cages.  What if all of our vaccines and medicines, etc., are being tested on humans first?  Do the "mad scientists" somehow justify their actions, like "for the greater good"?
              </p>
              <p>
               It's just really sad that people dismiss these questions without any concern.  If there is human trafficking, then humans could literally have any purpose to the elite.
              </p>
              <p>
               A Trump tweet probably isn't going to be enough, but I wish he would.  I voted for him because I wanted him to expose PizzaGate and 9/11, but he hasn't.
              </p>
              <p>
               I honestly don't think we win until Hollywood falls and TV and radio stop subliminally programming people to be psychopaths.

             I know he is. But at the same time calling pizzagate a fake story, or basically a diversion. I'm not saying Jones doesn't believe it, but Alefantis tried to sue him, so he has to tiptoe around the pizzagate. I know he still believes it. The report he's giving is still basically talking about it.

            This post is DISINFO. First of all, the title is not the title of the video but your opinion to one line he said and ignoring the rest of the message! He is talking about the establishment and media hiding human sacrifice and child trafficking.
           </p>
           <p>
            He said "they are making up fake Pizzagate stories". That's it! If you put that line in context to what he is saying the rest of the time, he talking about the ESTABLISHMENT and the media who are not wanting what's going on with child trafficking, kidnapping and child sacrifice getting out. How it doesn't get coverage.
           </p>
           <p>
            Alex Jones has always believed. I've watched him for over 10 years. He's always talked about it. What he originally retracted was Comet ping pong and James Alefantis. He was going to be sued be James Alefantis for what he accused him of on air without legal proof. He was going thru a custody battle AND they were threatening to shut him down and he did what he had to do to save his butt.
           </p>
           <p>
            I was mad at first too until I knew the details and that he was trying to step away from the whole Alefantis thing. Since so many retards equate Pizzagate to a child trafficking ring in a pizza parlor basement, it turns people away from the big picture. He wants people to know about the Satanic sexual abuse and all. But not have "Pizzagate" attached to it. But in the context of this video, that doesn't even come up! So you are spreading disinfo.

             yeah, I agree with all that you're saying. People who haven't actually read into the whole thing automatically affiliate it to "the basement stores children." Really the place that stuff happened was at Pegasus Museum.

             You are correct.  I watched the video and it is total disinfo,  I don't know why someone would post the exact opposite.  If someone does not agree with him that is their right, but posting the opposite does not help our cause.

             I am going to watch it.  Why would this person post something like that.  I don't always agree with   Jones, and others like him, but would never think of posting a disinfo post about them.  Especially something entirely the opposite.

              Well Alex Jones is hated here. I don't agree with him about everything. But when it comes to this post, it's disinfo. A lot of people here don't like him. But, he's exposed a lot and he has always talked about this. He doesn't like the term Pizzagate because of how they are using that to make us look crazy.

              Yes I love Jake. I think he was threatened with that letter but it didn't go thru. But, he didn't work for 20 years to build a national show that reaches millions. He wasn't having the deep state trying to shut everything he worked for that was his families livelihood. Jake wasn't in a custody battle where that could have made him look bad.
             </p>
             <p>
              Alex Jones has always stood up against what Pizzagate/Pedogate stand for. He doesn't want James Alefantis and Comet ping pong attached to it for obvious reasons. Even after he basically had to kiss James Alefantis' ass, everyone there started saying "allegedly". One said, "we need to word things a certain way now".
             </p>
             <p>
              I've posted about Jake Morphonios here several times. He's one of my favorites! But, the 2 cannot be compared. Life is not that simple. We didn't walk in his shoes. So it doesn't mean Alex Jones wasn't being "a man". Maybe being a man means not being dumb enough to lose everything you worked for over one person and having the balls to suck it up and humiliate himself so he didn't have the whole damn government take it all away.

              Thank you.... There's a lot one could bash alex for- But Pizzagate as a whole, Is better off because of infowars and alex.  People who don't understand this- are retarded.  Actually-  I think most people understand that.... Its mostly like shills making posts like this.

               I agree .  Dumb name   Everybody loves pizza, everybody hates pedo.  The elites don't want that word blaring at them, they would rather people think there is a war on pizza.  I have had people ask me, why are they trying to kill that guys pizza place. It's all about marketing.  Parents need to see that word everyday plastered in front of their face. Pedogate not pizza.

            Hopefully. When the trove of blackmail tapes is uncovered, Alex Jones will be in there. And we can put him away once and for all.

            Jones was sued by Alefantis. Got to choose the battles, that one could have ended his business, and with it the show.

             And now thanks to all the great work by Voat members (including the Rotchild family photo) we know just how big that Psycho Comet owner is!!!!!!  Still, I will never forgive Alex for what he did! We all know that the most dangerous job in the world is being an investigative journalist. Ben Swann did his job and never retracted - and that was CBS mainstream. Shame not all have the courage of late William Cooper!

              Then you are not looking at the big picture. Have you followed him for over 10 years and heard him discuss this topic over and over and over exposing these freaks to millions?

              said it right. He needed to choose his battles. Lose everything or retract what he said about a person and business? He did NOT say that everything else was false.

             Yes. I wasn't posting this to call out Jones. Let's not forget, that guy snuck into Bohemian Grove and called people out about it publicly. I was showing how he has to say that when talking about anything pizzagate related just to cover his ass.

              Nobody gets to sneaf in the Bohemian grove and tell the tale - zero chance. This proves Alex was a plant put there by the controllers. Thanks for reminding me that episode. So a guy who sneaks into bohemian grove, a virtual suicide would apologise to that creep - not in a million years!

               I don't normally go off on people, but don't be stupid. Jones actually got in there and filmed it. And he called people out who never denied it.

            He may be referring to the basement story that circulated in the beginning about Comet, or the shooting, well hopefully anyways. It is still a bit bothersome to hear him say that, nonetheless.

             I feel like he still believes Pizzagate. Because he came out and reviewed the Podesta emails on Joe Rogan AFTER he had said that Pizzagate was a false story and had to apologize.

              Well honestly I think he wants people to see the bigger picture, pizzagate is pedogate. It's all the same people working in tandem, globally. Maybe he is trying to change perspectives.  It was never called Pizzagate over Comet, it was the codes in the emails.

            If he says Pizzagate is made up, why do people even listen to him.  I don't get it.  Please Stop giving  people like this a voice.He is not on our side if he says it is made up.

              Actually watch the video, this post title is disinfo. Alex Jones is shitting all over the elite. He talks about how in every single society there has been an elite group of satanic pedos.

               I am ready to provide info to anybody who wants to know anything about Alex. I followed him since 2002, listening to his podcasts 2 to 4 hours daily, never missing a beat. I am no1 authority on Alex, and I am sorry to say that Alex has sold out - and once you sell our, you take orders from above like the rest. Shame he has become what he always despised.

                LOL you are the number 1 authority on Alex Jones huh? Wow you listened for 2 to 4 hours a day! Suuuuure. So then you KNOW that he's talked about child sacrifice and pedophilia by the elite for years then! I've watched him for about as long as you.
               </p>
               <p>
                I remember that I would go to torrent sites and download documentaries about 9/11 because I knew it was lies. That's when Michael Moore seemed like he actually had a brain and made documentaries showing how fake 9/11 was. Every time I would type in "Michael Moore 9/11", the name Alex Jones would pop up too so I started watching his videos and have followed him since.
               </p>
               <p>
                I don't agree with EVERYTHING Alex Jones says. I don't believe he talks about Israel's involvement in many things like he should. Just like with anything, you need to use your filter and not believe everything you hear. Research yourself. But, when it comes to pedophilia and child sacrifice by the sick ass elites, he has been on it for years exposing it to millions who would never have known.
               </p>
               <p>
                Call him what you want, but in this case you are wrong, and you are not Number 1 Authority on Alex Jones. 🙄 Obviously.

                 So Alex of 2008 is the same Alex of 2017??!! Can you name his regular guests he used to have on? Michael Tsarion, Alan Watt, David Icke were his regulars - since he became Trump's cheerleadee that all changed. I mean how dumb does he think we are to make us believe that Trump is anti establishment when he sat next to Kissinger at the White House. Alex has sold out big time. He was exposing falacy of the left-right paradign for years only to sell out to one side. Trump? MAGA - it's a sick joke. Just take a look at Trump's cabinet, it includes a character named Wilbur Ross, current secretary of commerce - it's the same Wilbur Ross that had initiated Trump's bankruptcy bailout in 1992 (Bloomberg article). But does Alex mentioned that? Why not? He has done 180 on so many fronts.

                  Nobody is the same as they were 9 years ago. The world changes. I agree with him on Trump. He's not like the others. But that's a totally different conversation. The point is that none of what you brought up here has anything to do with his views and coverage of child trafficking.
