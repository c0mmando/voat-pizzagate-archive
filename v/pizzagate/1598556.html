            I have followed his series since day 20 of Braverman going missing which is where he started. He sources and cites all his info on a Google docs presentation on the last slide in the description under the video and says he operates under a 20% working theory to develop his storyboards, which is respectable given that all this started as a theory due to circumstantial evidence, but his contributors are helping in so much that ratio is probably 10% now   I have found them all except for 4 of them and made my own copies. I am going to mirror them on Vidme under the same nickname when I find the time Vidme only allows one upload at a time, but if you try opening multiple tabs to upload multiples simultaneously the varying lengths of the videos makes them get added in non numerical order and leads to confusion amongst viewers as I found that out on my first vidme acct under FALKENEWSITARD ; I will repost them all under FAKENEWSITARD2 on Vidme soon enough though..

            Something I did notice about Webb though in his last vid where he was talking bout how they harvest the organs on that mountain, it sounded like he was making a kind of moral excuse for them and downplaying how fucked up they're being. Maybe I misunderstood.

            I personally think Seaman should be getting far more info out there than he is, and being one of the main public faces of pizzagate he has failed to get out much and just says "look into this yourself". How about a shoutout to Voat once and a while and directing people there? He also spends too much time on other stuff atm like gold, bitcoin and Trump. I've even almost given up on his pizzagate videos because he never seems to cover much new ground in them.

            I fully understand those suspicions. I think the disinfo/distraction one is prob the least damning to me. The fact he seems to think there is no occult/Satanism involved at all, well he may sincerely think that somehow but you're right, there are countless indicators to the opposite and him insisting that there isn't is a red flag I agree. I'm still on the fence as I want to have faith, but we'll see.

            There's sources, you can view them every day. Go the first video of any given day (not the 2nd or 3rd, so on). Click on Show More...near the end of the long list is a link to Google Docs where he stores his slideshow. There's comments he places under each slide with the sources...and links.

             Agreed, he mentions early on the series that the PG direction is just too farfetched for non-redpilled people, and is the reason he stayed away, but as good researchers we must take what we can where we can and advance our cause and efforts by any means possible. His efforts were more focused on the Clinton Foundation and Hillary's shadow govt proxy army in the beginning but I had faith that the 2 directions would eventually intersect and when this shit breaks out I will be vindicated and history will be made. Let's all focus on the real issue and keep doubling down on exposing these SOB's..

            So all the FBIANON AMA  revelations should be discarded? Just because they came from alleged LEO? GW never monetized his video series like Davisd Seaman, he's never asked for a penny and even suggested people wanting to donate to his research do it elsewhere. He even takes himself off any beneficiary list for the Qui Tam lawsuits that will result from this when it breaks publicly after Grand Jury Indictments and the ensuing court proceedings, he also wisely arranges himself a protection net by maintaining a sourced citation list at the very last slide of his google docs presentation. Not to mention I suggested many times to David Seaman that he could benefit from looking into GW's intel early on when he only had 35k subs and was met with silence. Even yesterday on his Wall St to Main St. interview he admits when asked if he ever looked at GW's intel that he "Looked at it a bit and couldn't understand it." I tweeted to him I was sad to hear him say that and got crickets as a reply. I appreciate David's impassioned pleas to investigate investigate investigate but his info has never matched GW's in terms of breadth, verifiable cited sources and his financial advice in and of itself regardless of his counter claims, is suspect. George is offering ways to drain the swamp in which the government would still be able to function, because in reality if all conspirators were to face indictments simultaneously it would cripple all branches and create a vortex vacuum to be filled instantly with more swamp denizens eager for their turn at the trough. The best way to proceed is to take the intel from ALL sources and separate the wheat from the chaff..

            He appeared to deny deleting them himself. YouTube cs suggested to me, very swarmily, that only George could have deleted them. I would guess that someone in power at GOOG deleted them on the request of someone more powerful.

            I have reservations about GW. He just seems to know too much and often it sounds like firsthand knowledge. Which, while good, makes some of us question his motivations for releasing SO MUCH info at once. It's hard to trust anybody these days and especially somebody that comes off as CIA. I question him because I don't believe he is just figuring this all out day by day. This is not a story that suddenly just all came together. surely this would take a journalist years to pull together. But here is GW figuring everything out on the fly before everyone's eyes. Best case scenario, IMO is that it's some amount of misinformation mixed in with truth for some controlled purpose. I upvoted because I'll take the good with the bad.

             He talks some about where he gets info from. Other journalist and authors that have been looking at these crimes for years. The info I found out about him is that he first tried to reveal the FBI s domestic informer program. He  has a linkedin profile that says he works or works in the tech industry. He mentions his dad was military, and it sounds like he also has a history in the intelligence and/or Leo industry. Perhaps he was a "noc" himself. He  claims to be on some FBI list (if you search with his actual last name, Sweigert, you'll find a FOIA request by Webb for his own records) and claims hes being messed with somehow like Rupert and Gary Webb were. I get the skepticism, but from what I've seen he's the yang to the PG yin.

             Your points make a lot of sense. It is possible that he has a lot of intel (not research) and putting it together day by day. 65,000 emails is a lot to read.

             I live in near Port Canaveral where the cargo terminal is operated by Gulftainer, a company owned by Islamic Crescent Corp. A huge expose' was written about it by investigative journalists Alan Jones and Mary Fanning. THIS is where the Haitian kids will be brought for transit on to Norfolk. The fact that the Federal Govt (State Dept under Hillary and Treasury Dept under Jack Lew) and Canaveral Port Authority allowed this Arab group to have a 35-year lease is a huge UNREPORTED scandal.

            The problem of George Webb is bad presentation.
           </p>
           <p>
            Somebody should make a summary documentary of his material, because his material seems very interesting, but hardly anyone will "Start at Day 60 and watch a few...take it from there. "

             Wtf! His videos are sharp, focussed and very easy to understand. He's got an acute skill for sharing information for the wider audience....you sound like someone who needs the truth literally spoonfed..George is hitting the 80/20 rule with a home run....you're the remaining 20% that ain't worth the effort. ..no offense.

             Honestly,  the fact that dumb shit Americans need simple explanations to complex issues, out of god damn laziness on their own part, is a big reason this disgusting treason against this country has been allowed to fester. What are you expecting from a 3 time a day on the fly video blog?  I feel like I have had an entire semester in college on the information Webb has compiled.

               They are programmed to accept condensed 'universal truths' dispensed by authority figures.  This is the very reason that complex multi layered schemes go undetected at every level of our society.  The American Dream needs to end and the American Awakening needs to begin.

A ‘sentence’ is seen by the elites as sentencing someone or cursing someone - again because words have power in a way that humans are not fully aware of.

             It's not HIS problem. He is a genius investigator... He doesn't also have to be a genius presenter. People have this strange need for everything to be pre-packaged with a neat bow on it. When the FBI or NYPD investigate they don't produce polished documentaries to show each other. They are concerned about the information only.
            </p>
            <p>
             Yes it would be cool if someone takes his information and makes a documentary. I'm sure they will. Webb's research is the raw material. This is what the investigation phase looks like.

             I don't understand the 'bad presentation' people.  He is doing a tremendous job disclosing information and connecting the dots.  He's giving this to us.  Now it's up to people to take it and run with it.  Don't like the presentation style ?  Do another one in your own style.  Distribute it.  Bring in a new audience.  That's how web activism works.

A summary at the end of each day would be a fantastic idea. Just to make it simple.

            I have secret insider info. I have sources at the CIA, NSA, FBI , and other impressive TLAs. It must be true cause I said it on the internet! Stick to facts dipshits. I'm mad at myself for posting at this point. Why do I keep coming back to the biggest pizzagate  disinformation site there is. Viva la retardation.

            He's got lots of accounts. Are you one? George Webb might hit on things that are true but he's clearly trying to make a name for himself to profit just like many others. Doesn't mean he doesn't care about this shit but it's clear he'll do/say what he needs to, to make a name for himself.

            Fact- human trafficking happens.
Fact- scumbags in DC take part
Fact- pedophillia is non-partisan

             Fact; If people can fuck the system by using the system's rigged tool against the system, why not profit? After all the Bankster Cabals have been profiting so whoring hard for hundreds of years on our blood sweat and tears I think we should permit ourselves to take a few shekels off the bastards can I get an Amen from real #PIZZAGATERS?
No I'm not one of George's other accounts like you are claiming here, I'm just a survivor of pedo abuse some 47 years ago and just a regular Joe Shmo trying to make it in this evil rigged fucking world, If you don't believe me check out my YT chan Fins&amp;Racks Outdoors then check all the comments I've made on George's videos using that channel. You're a perfect example of the Dunning Kruger Effect in action..

            This is very hard to read though hits on some of the ways the kids are trafficked through ports.  If half of what this woman is saying is true, DJT has one hell of a mess on his hands:

             Excellent reply and having read that years ago the claims seemed so far fetched but in light of how so many things are surfacing, it certainly has more merit concomitantly.

            Yeah ok George. If it disagrees with you it must be fake news and shills amirite? Couldn't be that you're just retarded and/or pushing your own agenda aka trying to profit off PG. Anyone who does this is just as bad as killary, soros, podesta and trump.

            His latest tactic to start draining the swamp was to ask for only the meta data from the emails be released, as it would not cause such a nuclear detonation in the swamp and last couple vids he is saying that the 650k emails are not only in Hillary's possession but have been leaked or sold to China, Russia, Israel, France and the UK, so he put fire to the feet of a lot of co-conspirators to come clean and the tactic is working very, very well. He's like telling them come out now, explain yourself or risk the WHOLE email coming out down the road, so I think he's one smart MO FO IMHO..

             Go down to the port with a drone, look for non descript white elongated vans with no windows. fly the drone and watch them loading the drugged kids and leaving real quick . There is an Instagram pic of the vehicles they use Jabaroo posted it I think, like wood, but concrete, like wood but concrete was the #tag I think..

            Notice how he refuses to answer the questions on ERIC BRAVERMAN, ? when for weeks he has been saying "WHERE IS ERIC BRAVERMAN? "   well where is he Georgie Porgie?
           </p>
           <p>
            I'm betting he's right where his teaching schedule has him meant to be. MEH If George was so very very concerned for the welfare of Eric Braverman, why does he not update his viewers?
           </p>
           <p>
            as for "WHO Killed Monica Petersen.?? " Monica Petersen killed Monica Petersen.    DUH
           </p>
           <p>
            George needs to try harder.

            One of my best friends from college work for Booz Allen Hamilton for several years and I haven't been able to get ahold of them however the last time I talked with him he basically told me he had to leave the company under confidential terms was not allowed to speak about anything and they gave me a nice settlement to keep his mouth shut so I'm working hard to get him on my calendar and find out what the hell's going on over at that company

            The Syria video or heart donation then chest sewed up that he points to was from Press TV per his label.  If I find it I will append. Delaware had a prolific physician Pedo.  Maybe that's the case.  Here is one of my favorite Pedo vids however it is harsh and exposes Trump. I have a lot of hope in faith in Trump even if when younger he did things.

             Been wondering if Trump intends to fall on the sword of his past in order to end this.

            <p>
             Could well be. He sees their pedo taste, one he may have even tried accidentally or intentionally a couple of times, but now has regret and sees how the practice is literally destroying the country he loves.

                 hmm ok...  the first story says she filed a $100 lawsuit without a lawyer, and "the address she listed on the court documents is a home that is foreclosed in Twentynine Palms, Calif. A neighbor, Danny Mira, told Radar that no one has lived at the home since its owner, David Stacey, died in October last year" and "the phone number the woman listed on the court documents is not connected, "
                </p>
                <p>
                 [I keep it in contention, but its not strong on evidence - did she persist with the case? withdraw it? ]
                </p>
                <p>
                 The 13 yr old Jane Doe retracted her allegations. So I cant place much weight on those. Normally I'd still be really suspicious - but we know Clinton's modus operandi of accusing her enemies with whatever she is guilty of (like that dating website that accused Assange of being a pedo but -sloppy work hillary - that dating website company had the same listed warehouse address as other clinton organisations)
                </p>
                <p>
                 Thank you for taking the time to provide the links. It doesnt convince me - but i dont rule it out of contention
                </p>
                <p>
                 If I had to make a guess, I'd say trump used to push the line below the age of consent, in the same way you could probably lock up all the beatles and the rolling stones and led zeppelin members -  but when he learnt of the really sick murderous infant paedophilia he got his shit together and realised where it was leading

                  Trump is friends with bill and hillary. Any division among elites is purely theater for the goyim. His whole administration is packed with dual citizen israel first, zionists. The jews have been expelled from countless countries for blood sacrifice of children. Trump is in bed with the establishment pedo rings andanti american israelis

                   but the unparalleled media attack on trump shows that the zionists think he's gone rogue. They do not trust him and fear him. Yes trump has to rub shoulders with them but he may be that rare outlier that betrays them

            I was posting all the facts hand evidence has stated he has and actual photos he has of bodies with their chests cut open and ribs spread to remove the heart. He has stated he has 19 separate yahoo accounts of the Obama admin &amp; state dept. He has names. Videos. Tail numbers planes. There are many great journalist from all the world helping him in a collaborative work. He states he was in Kosovo and watched the horrors of organ harvesting himself. 
He indicated he is not alone. They are terrified of him because they won't dare to silence him even thou have erased hi videos before.

            Anyhoo...yes, Mr. Webb is not always spot-on, but that is the nature of citizen investigation, connect the dots as best as you can with the available info.  Also, don't forget that he reportedly has contact with alphabet agency leakers.  Hell, Scott Peterson was sentenced to life in prison with less evidence than pizzagate has uncovered...essentially because he was an asshole that cheated on his wife.  Just imagine what we could do with LEO investigative tools and a mirror copy of the Weiner/Abedin laptop hard drive

              It's a gamble of usernames..it gives the impression that when he jumps in to say something, it must be important.  But, on the other hand, he can't post too often because his username would dilute his message.  It's kinda like Lazlo in Real Genius....

            He alleges CPPP is where kids are showcased and brought in thru tunnels.  To me the worst thing or proof I saw personally against Jimmy Comet is the unredacted Instagram pic of the erect penis fucking a kid and a comment "you really nailed that one". It's hard to see how such a picture is art.  Also I want to repeat that the bathroom enclosure at CPPP seems too large for the two small commode rooms.  I know things have been remodeled but the 2nd BR could have a secret passageway, near the woodpile.

            Listening to George all this time I've come to accept the main thing is stopping the blackmail entrapment, the oil, drug, organ, and human trafficking.  I'm not an expert how best to do that wrt immunity deals or not.  Also George on the Kerry Cassidy interview near the end discusses how Trump is comprimised by Epstein x 1-2 only and should just come out with it and end it.  I think he said 1993. I don't want to be complacent.  I am sick to death of theses pedos and the entrapment blackmail and extortion.

            The downvotes might be coming from more nefarious sources than run of the mill shills? Or it may just be coincidental? You start taking more flak the closer you get to the target? (I've only just recently started following Webb I admit and I need to catch up, it takes time.)

            In short, South &amp; Central American, and European children boated into Haiti, those as well as Haitian children processed through Haiti boat port and paired with phony parents and phony paperwork, shipped up to Florida or Virginia ports, kept at host family homes, bused up to DC, moved through DuPont underground tunnels, popped up and shown at Comet [for auction]. I guess the tunnels are a means of speakeasy travel for the buyers too. These people are pretty sick.

             I don't see how you are able to keep phony parents quiet. If they committed no crime in the process then they cannot be easily blackmailed. We would be talking about dozens if not hundreds of just surrogates involved.

            he claims the kids come from al over S.Americe to Haiti en route to DC and Europe - he claims the kids are offloaded at  port in Charlottesville Virginia, then (at some point) through the undergound tunnels to Comet PP network

            Do we have any previous posters with suspicious activity in Charlottesville? Any Tunnel network entry points identified there?

             Charlottesville is inland.  He said Norfolk was the port, then to Charlottesville.  Charlottesville is thought of as a CIA spy city where they recruit the smarties at UVA.  Charlottesville has a nazi police force which now makes sense to me.

            HERE IT IS. IT FINALLY COMES OUT GEORGE WEBB HAS MADE THE CONNECTION. WE WERE RIGHT!! VINDICATED, THIS IS IT THE STRAW THAT BROKE THE PEDO CAMEL'S BACK @ 5:33 IS THE REVELATION
           </p>
           <p>
            P.S.
I have a YT channel and YT has been fucking with me since I started commenting on #PG vids and recommending George Webb everywhere, I am not asking for donations but my small Outdoors channel is monetized and it would be poetic justice to fuck with them right back by getting you guys to make one of my latest videos  go viral. It's cute BTW.. Just search YT for ;
"Gretel, the cute little toy humping Porkie". 
Thanks in advance, God Bless y'all \(-_-)//

              Just watch tomorrow's upload, it will give you the meat, this was only the appetizer.. BTw I've been lurking since 4 chan, and Webb's efforts are unequaled by ANYONE out there, he IS spearheading a wider scoped investigation series than the PG community ever did and and used sourced citations since day 53 of the "Where is Eric Braverman" series. I believe he will be shown as instrumental when the indictments &amp; trials start. Just sayin..

                Go ahead and award him every Pulitzer Prize there ever was, is and ever will be if this leads to humanity ridding itself of the yoke of enslavement the Banking Cartels have kept on us all for hundreds of years. When you look at the really really big picture those old vampirical parasite shitstains are responsible for ALL human suffering on the planet. If I could I would personally inflict  physical emotional psychological spiritual sexual unbearable and eternal pain on them till the universe collapses on itself . And I would repeat it all again in parallel and multi universes, then I'd get a time machine and repeat it all again, over and over again and again and again ad nauseum..

               You are completely correct.  I see people focusing on CPP and Pegasus...and while that is good and productive I suppose, George Webb is playing Hologram Chess with 5 levels above that stuff

                That's because pizzagate is a false-flag planted to detract people from doing what George Webb is doing. HRC doesn't give a shit if JA rots in prison.

                5 upvoats??? How many accounts do you have George? Stop trying to profit off child trafficking scumbag. This shit is real. It's not an opportunity for you to profit of trumpets and other tardbots that can't discern fact from fiction.
