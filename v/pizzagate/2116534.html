Let\'s make this crystal clear.......when social medias are allowing this shit to go on, they can be held liable for DISTRIBUTION of child porn </p>
<p>&quot;Child pornography is pornography that exploits children for sexual stimulation.[1][2][3][4][5][6] It may be produced with the direct involvement or sexual assault of a child (also known as child sexual abuse images[7][8][9]) or it may be simulated child pornography. Abuse of the child occurs during the sexual acts or lascivious exhibitions of genitals or pubic areas which are recorded in the production of child pornography.[1][2][4][5][6][10][11] Child pornography may use a variety of media,[12] including writings,[7][13][14] magazines, photos,[12] sculpture,[12] drawing,[12] cartoon,[12] painting,[12] animation, sound recording,[15] film, video,[12] and video games.[16]&quot;</p>
<p>So even anime stupid fucking cartoons IS considered child porn due to INTENT. So keeping these sick threads up, after many have called your attention to it, is breaking the damn law. This shit has got to END NOW here, FB, YT, Twat, GoOg....we have kept silent long enough. Companies that allow this shit need to be held liable. </p>
<p>Many truly good people have spent hours upon hours, months &amp; months to bring this shit down only to have 4-5+ threads right here doing exactly the acts of what we are trying to stop. The SJW BULLSHIT free speech, love who you love can kiss my ass. </p>

            Sometimes people think there is a very thin line between free speech and child porn.  But if you have a brain or a decency Geiger counter you will know the difference.  What was posted (the 12 yr old girl pic) is definitely porn.  Those that do not see it will only deny because maybe they don't want it to be taken away or they are afraid to speak up for fear of being branded "out of date" or "old fashioned".  It is time for all of us to face the music about child porn and speak up for those that have a smaller voice.  Thanks for posting this. Upvoat
