<p>Hm. Marina Abramovic\'s work. Donated by Tony Podesta. <a href="http://www.transformerdc.org/special-events/overview/collectors-view-2010">Here is more proof</a>, courtesy of Jimmy Comet\'s gallery, that Tony owns Abramovic\'s work.</p>

<p>I\'m simply arguing that <strong>blood</strong> is a far more important factor to this. It means that Tony Podesta manages parts of Marina Abramovic\'s work, so he literally is in charge of all the strange figurines, organizing the dismembered figures, and, I\'m assuming, supplying the &quot;fake blood&quot; that the fucked up Liberal bourgeoisie drink like jello shots.</p>
<p><a href="http://bravermangallery.com/bakery/hell-yes-nathalie-djurberg-video-works-from-the-heather-and-tony-podesta-collection-washington-d-c/">Here\'s another gallery event where Tony and Heather donated artwork.</a>
&quot;Hell Yes!&quot;, part of the Tony and Heather Podesta collection and showing at the Braverman gallery, is essentially just snuff films redone in claymation. The gallery also put on a strange <a href="http://bravermangallery.com/exhibited-artists/marina-abramovic/">Marina Abramovic movie</a>. It\'s fine if you think it\'s <em>just art</em>. But try seeing their work as representations of what they <em>sell</em>--through, of course, auctions held by people like <a href="http://www.transformerdc.org/special-events/overview/transformer-12th-annual-silent-auction-and-benefit-party">James Alefantis</a>. </p>
<p>Remember that Tony Podesta rubs shoulders with Kings, Sultans and billionaires, and has participated in the Art in Embassies program, created of course, by Hillary Clinton. The art is not only disguised by artistic license, but also by sensitive shipping containers on non-civilian airliners. He may be one of the few Americans with the ability to access the most top secret board rooms at both Al-Saliyah Airbase and the Qatar Museums Authority, one of the most powerful art organizations in world whose members included <a href="https://family.rothschildarchive.org/people/146-nathaniel-charles-jacob-rothschild-1936">Jacob Rothschild</a>. </p>
<p>Finally, it\'s worth noting that Matt Sesow, artist working with James Alefantis\' Transformer, had his art sent to Jordan through an <a href="https://wikileaks.org/syria-files/docs/665100_-32-foresight32-a-shout-out-from-my-city-2-hello-salut-hallo.html">international art exchange</a> at the Foresight Gallery in Amman, <a href="http://www.foresightartgallery.com/">totally not an pedo-illuminati front hinting at pederasty on their front page</a>, &quot;under the Patronage of H.E Ms. Corinne Breuze Ambassador of France in Jordan&quot;.

            A guy who posts pictures of a small child with her hands taped down, and the same child in a shirt that says "Pizza Slut," yeah he must be a great guy right. Just a wonderful gay man who happens to love children. That's YOUR version. Do YOU hear YOURSELF? How can you see that there is not something strange going on here?

             Good lord another one of these "its just art" people. Just because you, or anyone else, says "its art," that doesn't make it true. The idea that "anything can be art" is BULLSHIT. Marina Abramovic carved a pentagram into her stomach, and during one performance she jumped on top of a flaming metal pentagram until she passed out. HOW IS THAT ART?

                Except that would be illegal. Leaping over a pentagram until you pass out isn't.

                It's funny that you think accusations of pedophilia is a good enough reason to justify killing someone. You're the reason we have laws.

              Yes, the universe is fundamentally interconnected. This is exactly why if you exhaustively research two or more distinct entities, your search will inevitably yield seemingly meaningful coincidences.

             <p>
              Once you start letting those coincidences convince you of "something" (especially if that "something" is indefinable, AKA "I just KNOW something must be going on here even if I don't know WHAT"), then you've fallen victim to

                Someone qualified? Coincidences should be viewed through an extremely critical lens if you're trying to make a case for or against something.

                The only thing that's true is that you people are scared of weirdo artists and their weirdo art shows.

                If a CNN headline was "Wealthy Politicians Caught in Pedophile Ring" and then I read the article only to find out that no politicians were caught in any pedophile rings...

                 Only stupid pieces of dogshit like yourself think that these people are harmless "weirdo artists and their weirdo art shows." You fucking idiot. Are you not aware of the concept of front businesses? Front organizations? They sell an "art piece" for $50,000, but what they're really selling is a kid that's been kidnapped and trafficked in. You really think none of this goes on? Stick your head back in the sand, ostrich boy.
