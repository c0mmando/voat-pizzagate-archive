<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Cheryl, Wow, it has been 10 or so years since the &quot;trial&quot; before the US. Congress where I last saw you. Of course, I have followed your career ever since through John who as you know still calls you one of “his” stars.</p>
<p>I am sorry to bother you on a weekend, but our mutual friend was kind enough to give me your email address and to suggest that I send you a copy of the letter concerning INTERPOL that I have drafted for the SOS .</p>
<p>Although I have finalized the draft, Ican‘t put it on INTERPOL letterhead until tomorrow. The purpose of the letter is to seek a meeting with the SOS at a time and place of her choosing. I will be in Washington this Tuesday and Wednesday which I know would be too soon to schedule a meeting. But, I can return on April 8th or thereafter if you believe that a meeting would be possible.</p>
<p>In closing, you know me; so if my request has not been expressed in just the right way, please forgive me. Let me know what you would like me to do next after reading my letter for the SOS which follows.</p>

            Allow me to elucidate.  Would you wish to live forever, in the form as you are now, captured by time, in a "photos" shot of your being?
Having not transcended the very nature of matter, in your contemplation?  It strikes me, in my most humble form, as something of a cop out.  An unwillingness to be evaluated by the one who brought you to life.

             Have ye no faith, in the very singular point from which all beauty arises?  Do you doubt, the progression of time, to the benefit of your learning?
In such case, you have not understood the mystery, in that the techne is an expression of the psyche and may never, obtain possession of it.

                  Actually, now that you mention it, I’ve heard that before, except it was referenced to as “The Eye”. Those with “The Eye” are the master race. Is that correct? Is that related to the Illuminati somehow, or is everybody just obsessed with eyes?

                    I sat here and picked my brain but couldn’t put a good meaning with those words, so I googled it. Came back with lyrics to a “Mani Deum” song, and those were literally the only Google result for that exact phrase. Can you elaborate?

                          I agree the Christian God was fabricated as a brainwashing tool. I did notice, though, that you only referenced the Christian God. Do you believe in another God?

                          That whole thing actually makes a shit ton of sense, especially considering the Egyptians fascination with the Eye of Horus.

                            Do you too believe that the Coloboma is the “all seeing eye” of the supreme being? And, if so, may I ask what you believe the purpose is of the master race? What goal they hope to achieve?

                              Ah, I see (no pun intended). So then what do you think happens to us when we die? Energy is neither created nor destroyed, so I suppose reincarnation makes sense scientifically, but I saw a video that made me wonder if dying is a huge red pill of sorts. You “die” and then you “know”, essentially. But then where does our energy go?

                              And if the goal is to live in harmony with nature, why do people like Soros, evil people with this eye, do what they do?

                                   Listen my friend, do you beg of me the question of immortality?
Immortality is found in the dissolution of the ego.  Wherein we become God and at none command but the helm of will and in NO WAY what Crowley feebly prescribed.

                                   It takes suffering to know who we are.

                                    A) I don’t work with the mods. If you were really God, you would know that. So much for that omniscience.

                                             Well I have been trying to explain this to everyone that we engage from the place of Nirvana and so, no place is mine in the engagement of mortal form and yet I am here, in my apparent physical imperfections.  Yet still, the mind, it is somewhere else.  Many have said the memory resides in spirit and I find this to be true.

                                             The reason I began pizzagate, was my distress in the decline of the spirit within western civilisation.  It was my belief, that, only by holding a mirror of divinity up to man, in his contrasting actions, might I inspire him to become so.

                     In part it has to do with the way in which heraldry has evolved to hide the ancient symbols for which they once stood.  For example, the Sphinx becomes a Rampant Cat and then a Lion.  None bot a glove touch the cat, indicating only with full sight might we decipher the full image of wisdom.  The very nature of creation in and of itself.

            So wait, are you

            </a>
            too? That’s the OP of the original (deleted) thread. Unfortunately this thread is just as hard to follow and still leaves some claims unsourced. Maybe you’re new to Voat (I haven’t looked at your profile), but you’ll need to do your own work here. Rushing through a post, copying other users comments word for word and using them in your post (
            <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/user/carmencita">
             @carmencita
            </a>
            ), and then getting mad when mods delete said post, just to turn around and post something only slightly better, isn’t going to get your posts very far. We aren’t going to do your work for you.
           </p>

            EDIT: Out of curiosity, I did some looking. You,

            all created accounts within the last day and have all been spamming that INTERPOL email. I smell a shill.

             Well, you do not know how very wrong you are.  I am not a shill and if you cannot take the time to read my history, then you should not be making these charges against me.  No I am not any other user other than the name I have gone by since I started.  I have never had another account on here, ever.  I don't know what you are talking about.  I did not get mad about a deleted post of mine.  This is crazy.  I have been here 7 mos.  one more month than you.  I am on here every day many times all day long.  I don't know what this is all about.

               OMG!!  I am sorry.  I was totally confused.  You are right in saying yes it was copied from mine.  I have been wondering about them too Are they maybe going into the history of someone and copying comments?  IDK. Thank you.  So very sorry.  PS.  If this is true others should be made aware.  This is not what we want on here.  We want integrity.

                A little cope-with-Voat hint: Never reply to a comment or especially a Comment Mention (ping) from your inbox. Always click the "parent" or "context" button below the comment -- it will take you to the thread where you can see the whole conversation. That way you always know who is talking to whom. :-)

                No worries! I have much respect for you and what you’ve done here, and I know it’s easy to misread things. I think the OP responded to your comment (the one that was copied), so I’m pretty sure that’s where they got it from. And I agree, pinging

My family are quite big in the banking scene.

            No, you are absolutely wrong.  The reason this is allowed to happen, is because it is inherent to the current system, which is built on a platform of blackmail and mind control, headed by a technocratic elite, who utilise the materially inclined for their own ends.

            I have been uncovering the murders etc etc for over ten years, you should check yourself before approaching me with an attitude of presuming to know the correct approach to this topic.  Pursuing politicians is redundant when they are being excused within months!

            Could you elucidate which parts you find to be unicorn shit and I can illuminate you further.

            Here's the thing.  Basically rather than focussing on current trees which bark in circles, I am exposing the entire apparatus of control.  Due to the nature of the courts, media, academia - there shall never be a solution to the problem, as all are in it together, as it were.  The only solution is a far superior race of beings, infiltrating the many mechanisms of your human life and controlling the public for their own good, in a generous act of negative freedom, in a time where the people sorely need upstanding leaders, well educated leaders and certainly not power drunk nazi scientists, who aren't able to satisfy their wives.

Watergate Scandal Begins 1972
CIA Director Richard Helms ordered all MKUltra files destroyed in 1973 
Nixon is quoted as calling Bohemian Grove 
"The upper class in San Francisco is that way. The Bohemian Grove, which I attend from time to time—it is the most faggy goddamned thing you could ever imagine, with that San Francisco crowd."

             True, Helms ordered MKULTRA files destroyed on his retirement.

             Nixon's comments are more than interesting as he was obviously involved in a sexual
relationship with BeBe Reboso, though historically he seemed to have performed 
heterosexually at times as he had two children and he seems to have been one of the
abusers mentioned by Fiona Barnett/Australian "Pedo-gate."
