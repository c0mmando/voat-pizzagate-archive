<p>Question 5-012.
The IRS scandal will help us publicize it.
What should we follow specifically?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Why do HRC and the CF have ties to certain Indian businessmen, who, in many instances,
have been routinely accused of pedophilia?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Question 5-017
Is there any sign or reference of Moloch/Minerva in the CF? Any occult or weird
symbolism?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Plenty, if you know what to look for.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Question 5-021
Weren’t they all introduced by Sant Chantwal and connected from the India nuclear
deal?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>He is a major figure, but there are more. Why did India’s central bank leader recently step
down?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Question 5-022
I should keep looking into USAID, shouldn’t I…
Should I look into the shipping containers for the children?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Are you afraid of what you will find?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Question 5-023
Do you think the murder of DNC employee Seth Rich is suspicious, and could the two
DHS guys who were supposedly busted with guns have been set up?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Do robberies typically end with people getting murdered and no goods stolen?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Question 5-031
Does the human trafficking have to do with keeping people in line?
Is that aspect of the CF the place where people get vetted/get their membership in
“Hydra”?
Is the child trafficking for blackmail/dead-man’s switch/enforcement files as well as
recreation?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>1) Yes.
2) Yes.
3) Yes.
Question 5-037
10, and your second point is the truth
Wonderful, I went on a frenzy about that in the first editions of /cfg/.
Follow up set of questions: What connection does Cheryl Mills and the BlackIvy group
have to the Foundation? More sex slaves, or the possibility of blood diamonds, slave
labor, and jungle work? Mills was allowed to keep her clearance after she left the State
Department. Seems suspicious she is on the board of the CF and running a
“development” group.
Mills is almost as important as Abedin. Where did Mills work before joining the CF?.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Question 6-022
How pissed are you guys at Comey?
Could you name some companies/people/events we haven’t looked into already but are
worth digging?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>1) Most senior Intel guys are furious with Comey and DOJ in general. Grunts at the bottom
are confused and do not know enough.
2) What was the organization that put together that ad for HRC with all the celebrities?
What major figure who endorsed HRC has business interest tied to the Clinton
Foundation?
What constitutes Mark Cuban’s net worth?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Question 6-040
Obama using Pseudonym on Emails?
<a href="http://www.politico.com/story/2015/10/hillary-clinton-emails-classified-release-215359">http://www.politico.com/story/2015/10/hillary-clinton-emails-classified-release-215359</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>We leaked this. It just goes to show how corrupt the whole of government is.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Question 7-010
Is the shit posted on this site legit?
<a href="http://www.thecitizensaudit.com/">http://www.thecitizensaudit.com/</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>It is asking the right questions, and yes, many of HRC’s PAC’s and even her campaign solicit
foreign money and shadow money.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Question 7-016
We fight hard to make sure Hillary is not elected, right?
Any suggestions on how to red-pill normies on pseudo poll data?
Normies have depended on polling data for so long, it’s hard for them to realize that it
is over-sampled. They have a hard time understanding what over-sampled means.
Thanks for everything.
Do we focus on the WikiLeaks releases, or go back to Clinton Foundation work?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The next few batches of the WikiLeaks dumps should help answer this. It will start to make
sense when you connect the dots.
And, as an aside, when you are reading Podesta’s e-mails, remember that the Clintons deal
in weapons, drugs, and people. Some terminology in use is far more nefarious than many of
you suspect.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Question 7-021
How many people has Clinton killed this year?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Potentially 20, confirmed 6..</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Question 7-044
Is this important?
<a href="https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/2010">https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/2010</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Very important.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Question 7-063
“WHAT THE FUCK DO YOU MEAN BLACK MAGIC
HOW
WHAT KIND
WUT”</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It doesn’t surprise me. The Clintons were tight with Cardinal Bernardin, who was a
Satanist. Bill even gave him the medal of freedom or something.
Correct.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Question 7-071
How is foreign/dirty money funneling into Clinton’s PACs?
Are they using their 501(c)4’s?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Yes, but sometimes there are 527’s and 4947(a)1’s.</p>
