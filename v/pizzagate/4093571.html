            Rudd claims he has “no recollection” of meeting or speaking with Epstein and has called the revelations “deeply disturbing.”
           </p>
           <p>
            The former prime minister, who became vice-chair of the United Nations-affiliated organisation in 2014, has convened an extraordinary board meeting after it was also revealed current IPI President Terje Rod-Larsen borrowed US $130k from Epstein in 2013.
           </p>
           <p>
            “I first learned of contributions from Epstein’s foundations to the IPI in November 2019 through reporting by the Norwegian press. I was blindsided by this,” Rudd said in a statement to Norwegian business newspaper DN on Oct. 29, who broke the story.
           </p>
           <p>
            “These revelations were deeply disturbing to me, and to other members of the board. IPI’s work includes combating human trafficking and sexual violence,” he added.
           </p>
           <p>
            Rudd was questioned on the allegations on the same day on 2GB radio, based in Sydney, and repeated his assertion that he could not recall having contact with Epstein.
           </p>
           <p>
            “I remember calling in to a meeting which was called the advisory board for the president of Mongolia,” Rudd told the station. “I called into it and he (the Mongolian president) asked for my views, and I explained it to him.”
           </p>
           <p>
            “I have no recollection of Epstein being on that call. To the best of my knowledge, no (I never met him) I said in my statement yesterday that there was a function hosted by the International Peace Institute involving the likes of Henry Kissinger, the U.S. secretary of state, the U.S. secretary-general and others at the back end of 2013,” he said.
           </p>
           <p>
            “I have been told by my staff that Epstein’s name was on the invitation, whether he attended I do not know,” Rudd added.
           </p>
           <p>
            Rudd said the revealed financial links between Norwegian diplomat Rod-Larsen and Epstein were also concerning.
           </p>
           <p>
            “As a consequence of this latest development, I took action last week to convene an extraordinary board meeting and requested that Mr Rod-Larsen provide a report to the board on all these matters,” Rudd said.
           </p>
           <p>
            Rod-Larsen visited Epstein at his Manhattan home at least 20 times, according to DN. Journalists from the paper, told The Daily Telegraph that they struggled to get a response from Rudd for more than a year regarding the allegations.
           </p>
           <p>
            Epstein was arrested and charged with sex trafficking of minors in July 2019; he was found dead in his prison cell in Aug. 2019.
           </p>
           <p>
            Former U.S. President Bill Clinton flew on Epstein’s jet, infamously dubbed the “Lolita Express,” at least 26 times, according to records obtained by Fox News in 2016.
           </p>
           <p>
            In a July 2019 statement, Clinton denied ever visiting Epstein’s private island and said he had only travelled on the plane four times.
           </p>
           <p>
            A former associate of Epstein, British socialist Ghislaine Maxwell was charged this year for assisting the convicted felon with procuring underage girls to his island.
           </p>
           <p>
            Rudd is also a chair of the Asia Society Policy Institute and has been a strong advocate for Australia to have closer ties with Beijing.
           </p>
           <p>
            The revelations come as Rudd has been busy campaigning for a royal commission to examine the concentration of media ownership by Rupert Murdoch’s News Corporation Australia.
           </p>
           <p>
            The petition for the commission has garnered 400,000 signatures so far, but current Labor Party and Federal Opposition leader Anthony Albanese has refused to back it.
