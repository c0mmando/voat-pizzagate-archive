            These two wastes of oxygen don't deserve to live. It's a crying shame there's no death penalty coming for their crimes. I would love to see them burn ay the stake. Lethal injection is too good for them.

            An Open Letter to William Strampel, Dean of the College of Osteopathic Medicine
           </p>
           <p>
            May 2, 2017
           </p>
           <p>
            Dear Dean Strampel,
           </p>
           <p>
            A few days ago I read an article in the Washington Post that contained information that, for me, was very new. What I read were excerpts of your emails to Larry Nassar and other MSU officials regarding my police complaint where I alleged that Nassar has sexually assaulted me 16 years earlier. It was an incredibly painful article to read. It reminded me again why Larry Nassar was able to assault me, and so many other women and children, for so long. And it left me with many questions. Questions that I am going to ask now, so that perhaps someday, if someone else who reads this is in your shoes, they will think to ask these questions. And if they do, maybe—just maybe—a predator’s reign will end a little sooner, and some little girls or boys will sleep without the nightmares they would otherwise have.
           </p>
           <p>
            The part that caught my eye was when the Post reported that you met with Larry to discuss my police and Title IX report. You assured another MSU official Larry would only miss work “for a short time” during the investigation. When you heard that I’d talked to the IndyStar, you told Larry “good luck” and “I’m on your side.”
           </p>
           <p>
            I understand that you knew Larry well, and you didn’t know me, but I wonder, when you made that determination about what I’d alleged and who you supported, did you know my police and Title IX report contained the names of four medical experts, including three pelvic floor specialists, that I’d consulted over a span of more than 10 years, as I desperately tried to figure out what had happened to me? Did you know all four said Larry’s alleged “treatment” was well outside the bounds of any recognized medical technique and all of them were willing to say so?
           </p>
           <p>
            Did you know I had medical records and four witnesses showing I had been investigating Larry’s supposed treatment and consistently telling the same story, for 15 years, as I searched for answers? Did you read any of the national and international medical information I presented to both sets of investigators demonstrating what real pelvic floor therapy looked like, versus what your friend did to me? Did you read my written, point-by-point refutation of the videos Larry says show exactly what he does?
           </p>
           <p>
            Did you care about any of that evidence when you said Larry would be off for “just a short time,” or did you not even bother to hear the evidence, before wishing Larry “good luck” and deciding you were “on his side”? And since that was your response to me, with everything I brought, knowing what an uphill fight this would be, no wonder you didn’t listen to the woman who pleaded to be heard in 2014 too. Have you thought at all about the little girls who walked into Larry’s exam room since you welcomed him back in 2014, without putting any accountability or follow- up structure in place to make sure he followed the guidelines of his reinstatement?
           </p>
           <p>
            And when you saw my interview and it was forwarded around the office, did you consider that the statistical likelihood of a false accusation is a mere 2-8%, and Larry had already been accused, as you knew (though I did not) at least one other time of sexual assault in 2014? And did you consider that the news report contained a third independent claim of sexual assault against Larry, and that all of us were completely unconnected, and acted without any coordination—making it almost statistically impossible that we were all lying or “confused”?
I read your response to the anticipated media blitz: “I expect that this will be all over the paper tomorrow . . . Cherry on the Cake of my day!!!” I wonder, as you forwarded my video interview around and made light of what this would do to your day, did you once think about what my day was like when my image and details about my body—which no one was ever supposed to know— became national headlines?
Did you draw on any of the knowledge you have—or should have—about the impact of childhood sexual assault and consider what it would cost a busy mother of three to decide to take on a man like Nassar? To lay bare those graphic details in a way that would never allow me to regain privacy and confidentiality? Did you pause, even for a moment, to wonder what motivation I and these other women, all independent of each other, could have had to choose to relive that pain in front of a national audience?
           </p>
           <p>
            You didn’t know I lost 10 pounds in one week because I was so physically ill after giving that interview that I could barely eat. You didn’t know I had nightmares every single night for more than three months because I couldn’t escape the details. You didn’t know that the desire to protect myself, the fear, and the feeling of constant vulnerability, all returned with a vengeance because the memories were so close to the surface and I couldn’t get away. You didn’t know any of this. But you never asked. You never considered the evidence. Not once. Not at all. You watched my testimony, joked about how much it would mess up your day, and wished Larry “good luck.”
“I’m on your side.” His side. Not my side. Not the side of his other victims.
           </p>
           <p>
            And that is why we are here today with dozens of other young women who also have nightmares they can’t escape.
You can’t go back and ask the questions that you should have been asking all along. The damage is done. Little girls walked through Nassar’s door for years while you were the Dean, and came back out scarred in ways you’ll never understand. And you were wishing him “good luck.” But my sincere hope is that other men and women in authority will watch this unfold and, when they are faced with a similar situation, make a different decision. I pray they will ask the tough questions, and then wait for the answers, before deciding who to tell “I’m on your side.”
           </p>
           <p>
            Sincerely,
Rachael Denhollander

             The United States Congress responded to the sexual abuse claims that were made against Nassar and also responded to the personnel who were involved with USA Swimming and USA Taekwondo. United States Senator Dianne Feinstein introduced a bill that would require national governing body members overseeing Olympic sports to immediately report sexual assault allegations to law enforcement or designated child-welfare agencies.[108] Former gymnasts Dominique Moceanu, Jamie Dantzscher and Jessica Howard testified at a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing on March 28, 2017, concerning the bill.[109][62] Rick Adams, chief of Paralympic sports for the United States Olympic Committee and head of organizational development for the NGBs, stated at the hearing: "We do take responsibility, and we apologize to any young athlete who has ever faced abuse." USAG was asked to testify at the hearing, but declined.[62]~~

             Nichols competed at the 2016 AT&amp;T American Cup on March 5,[16] scoring 59.699 to place second behind Gabby Douglas. Afterward, U.S. national team coordinator Márta Károlyi said, "Maggie showed again that I can rely on her".[17] This competition cemented Nichols as a contender for the 2016 Olympic team.
            </p>
            <p>
             A month later, Nichols tore her meniscus while training her Amanar vault and had to withdraw from the 2016 Pacific Rim Gymnastics Championships in Seattle.[18] She underwent arthroscopic knee surgery and was out of competition for two months.[19]
            </p>
            <p>
             In June, she returned to competition at the P&amp;G Gymnastics Championships. She performed only on the uneven bars and balance beam, finishing 13th and 10th, respectively, and advanced to the 2016 Olympic Trials in July. There, she finished sixth in the all-around, fifth on vault, ninth on uneven bars, eighth on balance beam, and fourth on floor. She was not chosen for the Olympic team or as an alternate athlete.
            </p>
            <p>
             A few days after the conclusion of the Olympic Trials on July 13, 2016, Nichols announced her retirement from elite gymnastics via Instagram and interview,[20] and said she was taking time to rest before starting her NCAA career at the University of Oklahoma in August.

I had never told my coach about these treatments.

             Elite gymnast Maggie Nichols revealed Tuesday that she is "Athlete A" — the first to report sexual abuse by team doctor Larry Nassar to USA Gymnastics — and blasted the organization for not responding faster or doing more to stop him from assaulting more young women.
            </p>
            <p>
             In a response, USA Gymnastics said in a statement that after a private investigator it hired interviewed Nichols and a second gymnast it did not have "a reasonable suspicion that sexual abuse had occurred."
            </p>

             The USA Gymnastics National Team Training Center at Karolyi Ranch or simply Karolyi Ranch in unincorporated Walker County, Texas, southeast of Huntsville, was a gymnastics camp facility which was the site of the main training center for the United States women's national gymnastics team, located 70 miles (110 km) north of Houston within the Sam Houston National Forest. From 2001 to 2018, it was the USA Gymnastics' national training facility for women's artistic, trampoline, and rhythmic gymnastics disciplines.

              I don't either, but  Peak Behavioral Health Services, a mental health facility in Santa Teresa, New Mexico should be on everyone's watch list as suspicious, even outside of pizzagate.

            Makes me want to rethink more sympathetically when I hear SJW complaints about campus rape culture. Statistics dont bear it out as described, but there are definitely hives of scum in power preying on girls that are silenced by having their careers held hostage. Hopefully these reports can be used to bridge the left/right paradigm and promote dialogue/empathy. Both sides want justice. If they stop arguing with each other, maybe they can help get justice moving forward. I recall Ben Shapiro denying the culture (reasonably so, based on logic of statistics) but then asking for examples. He vowed that he would be right there clamoring for justice if victims could be convinced to come forward with their stories. Here ya go Ben...

             In 2011, a woman identified as Victim 2 fell asleep in class and Strampel summoned her to his office later. He told her not to sit down but to turn around twice so he could observe her body, she told police, before going on a rant degrading her body.

            This sounds A LOT like the MO of Keith Raniere/NXIVM, possibly pre-screening/grooming candidates?

            <p>
             LANSING -  William Strampel began a meeting in the spring of 2010 by announcing that he’d been told he wasn’t allowed to refer to students in the
             <a href="http://www.com.msu.edu/">
              Michigan State University College of Osteopathic Medicine
             </a>
             as his children anymore.
            </p>
            <p>
             “Except Breanna’s baby,” Strampel said, indicating Bre O’Keefe, a medical student who was then seven months pregnant. “That’s my kid.”
            </p>
            <p>
             That’s how O’Keefe remembers it. She calls it “one of the most humiliating moments of my life.” Strampel was the dean of the college. Several classmates asked her if what he said was true. It wasn't.
            </p>
            <p>
             To make matters worse, the meeting was also telecast to the college's satellite sites across the state, she recalled.
            </p>
            <p>
             <a href="https://www.lansingstatejournal.com/story/news/local/2018/03/27/william-strampel-michigan-state-larry-nassar-charges/460906002/">
              Strampel was arrested
             </a>
             Monday night and charged the following day with felony misconduct in office, fourth-degree criminal sexual conduct, and two other misdemeanors.
            </p>
            <p>
             He faces the misconduct in office charge, according to an affidavit filed in support of charges, because he "used his office to harass, discriminate, demean, sexually proposition and sexually assault female students."
            </p>
            <p>
             Strampel's actions during and after former MSU sports medicine doctor Larry Nassar's 2014 Title IX investigation resulted in two misdemeanor charges of willful neglect of duty, according to the affidavit.
            </p>
            <p>
             He faces up to five years in prison if convicted.
            </p>
            <p>
             Four women also told investigators that Strampel either groped them or made sexually inappropriate comments and appeared to offer them favorable treatment in exchange for sexual acts. Investigators also say they found pornographic images on Strampel's computer that appeared to be "selfies" from MSU students.
            </p>
            <p>
             But two former students say Strampel's "creepy" reputation was well known among students at the college.
            </p>
            <p>
             Nicole Eastman, who is publicly identifying herself as victim #4 in the criminal case against Strampel, said Strampel had groped her during the college's annual ball in 2010.
            </p>
            <p>
             She was set to graduate later that year, and told police investigators earlier this year she worried Strampel could have derailed her entire medical career.
            </p>
            <p>
             "It was accepted behavior at MSU," she said.
            </p>
            <p>
             Strampel, through his attorney John Dakmak, has denied inappropriately touching anyone and any "quid pro quo for sexual favors in exchange for any type of standing within the university's medical school."
            </p>
            <p>
             Dakmak also said Strampel, who served as dean of the MSU College of Osteopathic Medicine from 2002 until December of last year when he stepped down for medical reasons, never had romantic or sexual relationships with students.
            </p>
            <p>
             Neither Dakmak nor Strampel responded to requests for comment made Thursday.

            <p>
             Strampel's inappropriate nature was almost a running joke among students, O'Keefe said. Only, it wasn't funny.
            </p>
            <p>
             The fall prior to the 2010 meeting, O’Keefe sent an email to Strampel, asking for a meeting to discuss what could be done about her impending clinical placement. Newly pregnant and living in the Lansing area, she didn’t want to be away shortly after giving birth to her daughter.
            </p>
            <p>
             Strampel agreed to meet but wrote in response that O’Keefe should wear a low-cut top if she wanted to get what she was asking for.
            </p>
            <p>
             Strampel spent the meeting berating O’Keefe for asking for special consideration. When she received a clinical placement in Detroit, she asked for a second meeting.
            </p>
            <p>
             She and her then-husband attended the second meeting with Strampel. The dean told the couple that spending two years apart during clinics would be good for their marriage. Strampel told them that the only time he saw his wife during the early years of their marriage was to get her pregnant.
            </p>
            <p>
             The couple left the meeting shaken. O’Keefe couldn’t believe Strampel would talk about his wife way.
            </p>
            <p>
             Fortunately for O'Keefe, she got a placement with Sparrow Health Systems after another student dropped.
            </p>
            <p>
             “I had very little interaction with him after,” O’Keefe said. “I saw him at a local wedding, and I intentionally avoided him.”

             She couldn’t avoid Strampel at her graduation ceremony in 2012. Shaking her hand, Strampel complimented the red heels O’Keefe was wearing. He said they made her legs look good, O'Keefe said.
            </p>
            <p>
             “This is the final moment of medical school,” she remembers thinking. “I’m getting my diploma and that’s what you say to me?"
            </p>
            <p>
             Strampel had set off Eastman's creep radar early in her time as a medical student. At a free flu-shot clinic hosted by the college, he talked to her about drinking, she told investigators, and said how “it was good when women were drunk, because then it was easy to have sex with them.”
            </p>
            <p>
             She was also troubled by his boastful tone as he talked about another medical student who was caught cheating pleading with him in his office.
            </p>
            <p>
             "It was as if he enjoyed that position of power and her vulnerability in that situation," Eastman said.
            </p>
            <p>
             After being groped by Strampel at the college's ball in 2010, Eastman said, she didn't think there was anybody she could talk to.
            </p>
            <p>
             Two other faculty members were in a position to see the groping incident but said nothing about it, Eastman said.
            </p>
            <p>
             She was prompted to come forward after seeing the survivors of abuse at Nassar's hands testify in Ingham County earlier this year. She reached out to Rachael Denhollander, the Kentucky woman who was first to publicly accuse Nassar of sexual assault.
            </p>
            <p>
             Eventually, she shared emails and correspondence from Strampel to Denhollander, who forwarded it to the Michigan Attorney General's Office, which was investigating how the university handled Nassar. Then Eastman was contacted by a detective sergeant from the Michigan State Police.
            </p>
            <p>
             "With the climate we’re in now, people shouldn’t fear coming forward and sharing what happened to them," Eastman said.

                Good question(s). I think I came across that in the lancing articles... maybe... I'll go back over those and keep looking at Strampel if necessary, but, got plenty more to add to this anyway.
               </p>
               <p>
                Finding who hired him should be easy enough. As for who protected him... I think I read that there was initial allegations against him that were ignored.
               </p>

                Shit! Apparently lancingstatejournal only allows 5 freebies...

                <p>
                 <strong>
                  Attorney Jim Graves, who represents the woman whose report prompted the 2014 investigation, said he takes Strampel at his word that medical reasons prompted his stepping down.
                 </strong>
                </p>
                <p>
                 However, Graves added that there were already reasons he should have done so, including the way the 2014 complaint and investigation were handled, and not implementing stronger protocols on Nassar.
                </p>
                <p>
                 "I view him as a key actor in this whole unfortunate episode involving MSU and women and girls being sexually assaulted by Nassar," Graves said of Strampel.
                </p>
                <p>
                 Graves added that he thinks other MSU officials who played a role in the 2014 Title IX investigation should "be held responsible." He said the university should have turned to medical experts outside MSU instead of the four who knew Nassar well.

             Strampel was appointed dean of the medical college in 2002, after serving as acting dean since 2001 and an internal medicine professor. His appointment was celebrated by Lou Anna K. Simon, then the university's provost.
            </p>
            <p>
             "I join the faculty in being confident that he's the right person to lead this college," Simon said in a statement at the time.
            </p>
            <p>
             He had a strong background in military medicine before coming to MSU, including serving as special assistant to the U.S. surgeon general.  EAST LANSING, MI -- Around 85 students are blocking access to a room where former president Bill Clinton is speaking at 6 p.m. Wednesday to protest white supremacy and institutionalized racism at Michigan State University.
            </p>
            <p>
             The group listed a series of demands related to university structure, including the creation of a department of African American and African studies, a multicultural center and a college of race, class and gender studies.
            </p>
            <p>
             The protestors were so loud that they could be heard in the room where Clinton was speaking. Michigan State University President Lou Anna K. Simon left Clinton's speech to talk with the students. It was her dream to get the most land grants of any college and  to make MSU a residential collage. She needed the Clintons for that.

              Here is propaganda from the school newspaper on Hillary winning Michigan easily, 4 days before the 2016 Presidential Election.

             A 20 point lead was somehow washed away in less than a week, with Trump winning Michigan 47.5% - 47.27%
            </p>
            <p>
             The article is full of innuendos about Trump voters being racists.

              Interesting. So are you surmising the Nassar takedown prevented Clinton vote manipulation? Or that the unexpected win of Trump made it possible to bust the Gymnastic pedo ring?

               Neither..   I think Hillary rigged the election and then it was unrigged by White Hats.

               MSU newspaper was putting out the same Clown 4am talking points, justifying their anticipated landslide.

            I said, as some others did, that he quit way to fast.  There was something very odd about that.  Maybe he was paying Nassar for CP?  Maybe others were as well.

                Oh yes, they will be fighting with all their might, and I believe Nasser was a sacrificial lamb of sorts.  Maybe they think this will calm us.  Boy are they ever wrong.

               I actually think it's a massive Elite sex trafficking operation.

               We need to start looking far beyond 'abusers' and 'pedophiles'.

               Nasser was likely no more than a mid level EMPLOYEE of this sick system Elites have cultivated.

Possibly this is nothing but a High Level Vehicle for their CP Operation.  If this Pandora's Box is ever opened up, watch the Rats crawl into their holes.  There will be thousands.
