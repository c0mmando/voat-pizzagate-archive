<p>I remembered that I have been wanting to research who is behind the &quot;spontaneous&quot; riots. I always figured it was George Soros, at least as far as the funding goes, but who handles the logistics? Maybe Hagmann knew something so I checked out &quot;Organizing for America&quot; starting with Wikipedia:</p>
<p>&quot;Organizing for America was a community organizing project of the Democratic National Committee. Initially founded after the presidential inauguration of Barack Obama, the group sought to mobilize supporters in favor of Obama\'s legislative priorities, particularly health care reform. Eventually, the organization played a role in the midterm elections of 2010. Later, it became the grassroots arm of &quot;Obama for America&quot;. After Obama\'s second inauguration, it was reorganized as &quot;Organizing for Action&quot; and returned to its previous mission of organizing around the President\'s agenda.&quot;</p>
<p>So I checked out &quot;Organizing for Action&quot;:
<a href="https://www.ofa.us/">https://www.ofa.us/</a>  The page didn\'t have much so I clicked on &quot;Find out more --&gt;&quot; which takes you to the page where they list their causes. Here\'s where it gets interesting.</p>
<p>You know how there\'s been a lot of activity on VOAT and other #Pizzagate hubs centered around the repulsive, immoral idea that the desire to rape a child is just another sexual orientation? And how that &quot;movement&quot; is trying to attach itself to the LGBTQ.. movement (whether they want it or not) by, for instance, using the &quot;Love is Love&quot; slogan in &quot;pedosexual&quot; social media?</p>
<p>Marriage equality is one of the causes Organizing for Action lists and uses the \'Love is Love\' slogan to do so. But what stopped me in my tracks was the logo / icon Obama chose for it:
<a href="https://imgoat.com/uploads/512bd43d9c/10643.PNG">https://imgoat.com/uploads/512bd43d9c/10643.PNG</a></p>
<p>Two hearts. One big and one small. Now I know the little one isn\'t inside the big one. But here\'s what disturbs me about it. If you check out \'Love is Love\' on the internet, or FB etc, you\'ll find that it seems to be overwhelmingly about marriage equality. On Obama\'s site all images are of 2 adults. There aren\'t even images of any couples with children. So why a big heart and a little heart? Why not 2 hearts that are the same size? Or 2 identical hearts to symbolize gay love? Wouldn\'t that represent what they\'re about better? Does anyone else find this odd?</p>
<p>I am not sure if this Obama &quot;grassroots&quot; organization and its 250 regional chapters are worth investigating further - the website has pages that aren\'t up-to-date and his presidency was such a disaster I can\'t imagine there\'s any support left for promoting his agenda and besides, the Deep State seems to be handling that just fine - who needs grassroots? But the site\'s copyright tags are Â©2017 and it appears to be Obama\'s attempt to build a movement to promote his &quot;agenda&quot; going forward. For that reason I may hold my nose and sign up so I\'ll know if pedo equality starts being promoted. That logo just feels to me like a wink to let the pedos know - don\'t worry. Barry\'s got your back. </p>
<p>BTW, here\'s the video I got the Hagmann quote from: &quot;George Webb - Spies, Lies - Deplorables Be Ready!&quot;

quote is at 22:33 but the whole thing (27 minutes) is well worth watching.</p>',

            Well, another thing about OFA is that it went dead.  All of those millions of names and he did nothing with it.  He could have gotten people to run for office, start other groups that did things for the Common Good.  Nothing.  I was part of that.  Now Nothing.  Void.  Empty.  Bare. Just like him.

             How could he? How could he get all to organize for more fracking, drilling, spying on Americans and more regime change!

             It was the same with Dean for America that became Democracy for America. 
As a former political staffer I can tell you the Democratic party throws everything out after each election and starts all over again. Instead of building upon the last efforts. Minus fundraising emails from offshoot groups.

             It's set up to lose by design. There aren't really two parties. You can't put a piece of paper between the two.

              There has to be a power structure beyond what we know in the public eye.  It's the only thing that can explain our world.

              I know that now.  But it is so telling.  He could have spoken up, but now we know why he did not.  That design logo could have been done by anyone of them, the whole campaign was probably crawling with pedos.  He just had to approve it.  I can just see the thumbs up now.  Yes, the Dem. Party is dead as far as I am concerned.
