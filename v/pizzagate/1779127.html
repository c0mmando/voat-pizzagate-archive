            Isolated incident.  Until he does it again.  And he will.  Once a pedophile, always a pedophile.  These were small children, and they did the best they could.  They did the right thing by telling an adult.  A parent should not have to worry, but a four year old should not be left out to be cared for by children.  Unless they are teens.  We should be able to let our children play freely, but we cannot when we have perverts.
