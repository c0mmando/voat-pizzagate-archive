<p><strong>PLEASE REVIEW THE ARTICLE BEFORE RESPONDING</strong></p>
<hr />
<p>I\'m not sure if anyone else has had the chance to dig into this or not, but I\'ve been digging into this lately. </p>
<p>There seems to be a pattern, relating to Pedophilliac occurrences and certain Christian Baptist Affiliated organizations within the United States. </p>
<p><strong>One of the most NOTABLE and PROMINENT  occurrences is, of course &gt; the infamous Haiti Trafficking Scandal relating to Ms. LAURA SILSBY.</strong></p>
<p>Note the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Life_Children%27s_Refuge_case">Wikipedia</a> entry on the Scandal. It states the following: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>The New Life Children’s Refuge (NLCR) was founded in November 2009 by Laura Silsby (now Silsby-Gayler)[5]and Charisa Coulter, who are both members of the <strong>Central Valley Baptist Church</strong> in Meridian, Idaho. The organization described itself as a &quot;non‐profit Christian ministry dedicated to rescuing, loving and caring for orphaned, abandoned and impoverished Haitian and Dominican children, demonstrating God’s love and helping each child find healing, hope, joy and new life in Christ.&quot; The charity claimed to be in the process of acquiring land to build an orphanage as well as a church and school in Magante on the Northern coast of the Dominican Republic. NLCR further intended to provide adoption opportunities for American &quot;loving Christian parents&quot;. On January 12, 2010, Haiti was struck by a major earthquake and NLCR quickly formed the &quot;Haitian Orphan Rescue Mission&quot;, a group of ten people from the <strong>Central Valley Baptist Church</strong> and the <strong>East Side Baptist Church</strong> in Twin Falls, Idaho. Both churches are affiliated with the <strong>Southern Baptist Convention</strong>. The mission\'s plan was to go to Haiti and bring a hundred orphans to Cabarete, Dominican Republic, where NLCR had leased a hotel to serve as a temporary orphanage.</p>

<h1>These are but, only a few articles, in a long list of <em>LITERALLY HUNDREDS UPON HUNDREDS</em> of articles.</h1>
<p>There are too many for me to go through and keep track of. It was overwhelming. And quite disheartening to say the least. </p>
<p>This is EXTREMELY concerning to me. I am a Christian myself. Hence, I\'m rather alarmed by these findings. I take them very seriously. And anyone else who, here is a Christian, like myself, I\'m sure can relate. Especially given the nature of the following; please note: </p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>LUKE 18:16</em> - “Let the little children come to me, and do not hinder them, for the kingdom of God belongs to such as these. Truly I tell you, anyone who will not receive the kingdom of God like a little child will never enter it.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>ALSO:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>MATTHEW 18:6</em> - &quot;If anyone causes one of these little ones who believe in me to stumble, IT WOULD BE BETTER FOR THEM TO HAVE A LARGE MILLSTONE HUNG AROUND THEIR NECK AND TO BE DROWNED IN THE DEPTHS OF THE SEA.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>I believe this merits further research and investigation on our part.</strong> </p>
<p><strong>This needs to be brought to the Public\'s eye and Christian Parents must be made aware of this.</strong></p>
<hr />
<h1>It seems that many a times, the Christian laity (or the congregation) is funding this abuse with their Tithes to the Church. And that, to me as Christian is unacceptable.</h1>
<p><strong>Also, there seems to be an organized element to this as well, regarding the utilization of &quot;religious faith based NGO\'s&quot; or aka &quot;International Christian Missions&quot; abroad to carry out HUMAN TRAFFICKING OPS</strong></p>
<h1>THAT MADE ME SO LIVID BECAUSE I WANTED TO BE A MISSIONARY MYSELF!!! I DESPERATELY NEED YOUR HELP IN DIGGING INTO THIS FURTHER. THERE\'S WAY TOO MUCH MATERIAL FOR ME TO GO THROUGH. <strong>PLEASE HELP ME!</strong></h1>',

            Yes, and right when this story was starting to leak outside of Racine a group of criminally corrupt officials and elite power players quickly converged to make inside deals to make this story go away. They are very afraid of anyone outside of Racine learning about what is really going on there. This is linked to the bigger picture, and Racine is a main root of Pizzagate and Global Criminal Corruption. This specific case is part of the system of nefarious groups using religion, education, mafia, gangs, and law enforcement to cover up the real truth of Pizzagate and Global Criminal Corruption to protect the elite that are directly involved. Bishop Freeman was appointed to the Racine Police and Fire Commission by Mayor John Dickert. The last mayor of Racine, Gary Becker, was arrested for pedo crimes when he became too sloppy and was exposed by another corrupt city employee that could not be hidden and was ousted by those involved as a sacrifice to reorganize the structure at all levels. The current mayor and his associates then took control, along with many elite groups and foundations, and they are deeply involved in the bigger picture of Pizzagate and Global Criminal Corruption.
           </p>
           <p>
            This bishop, Mark Freeman, partnered with corrupt local law enforcement as part of the Social Justice League of Racine pushing for Sanctuary City protections (using Racine as a model), They are using anything including veterans groups, schools and corrupt churches as cover through an organization called Racine Interfaith Coalition along with Dominicans and other groups linked to the mafia. There is much more involved in this than Facebook posts, but that was tied to similar posts on the Social Justice League by a corrupt friend of the mayor named Fiona Murphy who has since deleted the Racine Social Justice Facebook account to hide what she had posted along the way. Beyond hate speech and calling Trump Hitler among many other posts, "Photos posted to Facebook are the reason Racine Bishop Mark Freeman has come under fire: The Statue of Liberty hanging a slave from a noose. A post discouraging children from pledging allegiance to the United States -- and other images too graphic to share." This is being coordinated by Soros, Clintons, McCain, and others at the highest levels. Racine is an experimental hub for Pizzagate and Global Criminal Corruption. They have their friends at the corrupt local newspaper publish extreme propaganda and engage in extreme censorship to hide the truth from the community and more so to hide the truth from those outside of Racine.
           </p>
           <p>
            Some of the those who knew parts of the truth went to the DA who was corrupt and would not investigate. They went to the police chief who was corrupt and would not investigate. They went to the sheriff who was corrupt and would not investigate. They went to the FBI and DOJ, and as it went up the chain, Jim Comey and Loretta Lynch personally were involved in stonewalling the investigations once they found out who it was linked to at the higher levels (including extremely wealthy elite and political powers such as the Clintons, McCain, Paul Ryan, Reince Priebus, Ron Johnson, Scott Walker and many others in both parties). Since some of this has been exposed the current corrupt mayor has announced his resignation, his cousin the corrupt city administrator has resigned early, a corrupt city attorney resigned, the corrupt district attorney resigned, and many other corrupt officials have resigned, retired or changed positions, with many of them getting jobs with corrupt businesses and organizations. They are all deeply involved in Pizzagate and Global Criminal Corruption. They are attempting to cover it up and hide under the guise of foundations and organizations such as the newly formed Fight to End Exploitation which is linked to many local and national foundations including Clinton Foundation, McCain Foundation and Ashton Kutcher the freemason and Kabbalah front man who is directly involved in Pizzagate and Global Criminal Corruption.
           </p>
           <p>
            They are pushing the model of Interfaith Coalitions and Sanctuary Cities to hide the real crimes that involve trafficking and abuse. Don't forget that Timothy Dolan was specifically recruited and promoted from St. Louis to Milwaukee to cover up Pizzagate and Global Criminal Corruption linked with the Vatican and Catholic churches, and was rewarded with another promotion to archbishop of New York. He is the only hope for an American Pope, and that should tell you all you need to know. This all links back to Knights of Malta, Knights of Pythias, Black Nobility, Kabbalah, Pilgrims Society, mafia, banking, United Nations Agenda 2030, and other groups and initiatives. Anyone that attempts to expose any of these groups is targeted, stalked, slandered, threatened and worse. Many mysterious death, murders, burglaries, and attempted murders have been linked to these same groups including a dead judge found in the Root River that is celebrated by those involved in Pizzagate and Global Criminal Corruption.
           </p>
           <p>
            Make no mistake, Racine is a main root to the entire network of Pizzagate and Global Criminal Corruption.

            In every good work, there is counterfeit as well, that is how Satan works, the great deceiver,  father of all lies.....and with the church and, well known christian leaders showing so little interest in the matter of Pizzagate I believe there are many counterfeits among us.

              I feel the same way.....I went to many christian websites and, sent a contact email to them to point out this very thing, and I never get a reply back, total silence!.....James Robinson, Franklin Graham, Pat Robertson, TBN, etc, etc, etc......there was a time when these people would be on the front lines organizing protest marches.....not anymore, very sad commentary on the church and the leaders for sure!

            .  It makes my skin crawl.
           </p>
           <p>
            transcript:*  And before I could stop him Eric had propelled himself from my arms to the man.
            <strong>
             Suddenly a very old smelly man and a very young baby consummated their love relationship.
            </strong>
            Eric in an act of total trust, love, and submission lay his tiny head on the man's ragged clothing.  The man's eyes closed and I saw as tears hovered beneath his lashes.
            <strong>
             His aged hands full of grime and pain and hard labor gently, so gently cradled my baby's bottom and stroked his back.
            </strong>
            No two beings ever have loved so deeply for so short a time. I stood awestruck. The old man rocked and cradled Eric in his arms for a moment and then his eyes opened and set squarely on mine.  He said in a firm, commanding voice, "You take care of this baby." Somehow I managed, "I will," from a throat that contained a stone.
           </p>
           <p>
            He pried Eric from his chest unwillingly, longingly, as though he were in pain.  I received my baby and the man said, "God bless you, ma'am. You've given me my Christmas."  I said nothing more than a mother's thanks; with Eric in my arms I ran for the car. My husband was wondering why I was crying and holding Eric so tightly and why I was saying, "my God, my God forgive me."  I have just witnessed Christ's love showing through the innocence of a tiny child who saw no sin, who made no judgement.  A child who saw a soul and a mother who saw a suit of clothes.  I was a Christian who was blind holding a child who was not. I felt this was God's answer.  Are you willing to share your son for a man.  Are you willing to share your son for just a moment.  Well, tonight we celebrate a God who was willing to share a son more than just for a moment.

            Take a closer look at all churches. It's not just a Catholic problem, they are all fallen away. The churches became demon possessed over the centuries. I know the satanists on the Internet know this and most forums are run by them. I'm not telling them anything new!!!

             I couldn't agree more. This is not isolated to only Catholicism. There appears to be a vast infiltration into the whole of Western Christendom, as in every variety, sect, denomonition, branch etc.

              It is! It is totally corrupted, in the Bible it is called the Laodicean churches. God showed it to me 35 yrs ago, I've been trying to tell people ever since! Do you know how hard it is to get people to see that the churches they attend are not really churches? Very hard!

            There are countless independent Christian organizations. Some are big organizations and some are small. The only connection between some of them would be the college's some pasters go to. It would be probably be a waste of time to try and find connections  between the smaller organizations. But I would bet if you looked into any of the biggest ones like Lutheran's,  Mormons, Methodists, etc you would probably find similar issues like in the Catholic Church.

            I see you highlighted a key word repeatedly in the articles listed. Also some common locations. Some people believe that Christians are all from the same power structure they are not. Certain denominations have very closed rigid heirarchal systems. They can and do as you have found use Christianity as a cover for evil.
           </p>
           <p>
            Catholicism and Protestant Christianity are two very different things as you know but Catholicism is completely closed off and operates under papal law with absolute immunity.
           </p>

              There's so many jokes about children and popes and priests and so on it is just seems normal to everyone now. It's insane.
             </p>
             <p>
              The amount the pope has spoken out is pretty shocking .. you know for something that's just fake news ..

            Being a pastor gives you access and authority and protects you from suspicion.  The Protestant churches need to clean house too.  I know of a case where the Lutheran hierarchy protected one of their own at the expense of the wife he cheated on.  I wouldn't doubt that they might do the same for a pedophile.  I don't know who can police the independent churches other than the police who don't seem to be doing a good job of policing themselves.  Parents need to not automatically assume that someone with power and respect is respectable.  Not being believed might be as damaging as being abused in the first place.
           </p>
           <p>
            If there is a judgement such as the Bible indicates, those who have abused the trust of their congregations will pay big time.  I don't believe in heaven or hell, but sometimes I find myself hoping there is a hell where those who have hurt others will experience all the hurt they have caused.  I don't wish for an eternal hell but "eye for an eye" would be appropriate.
           </p>
           <p>
            I grew up as a Lutheran being told that sins of omission were as bad as sins of commission.   To hate is as bad as murder Jesus said.  Christians, don't leave it up to your denomination, or your elders, or whatever authority governs those in positions of responsibility in your church. Watch out for the little ones.

            <p>
             Please help me here for a second
            </p>
            <p>
             I have ran into people with your perspective but am surprised to find you here on voat pizzagate
            </p>
            <p>
             Reason being -
            </p>
            <p>
             If there is no heaven and hell, do you also think there is no devil?
            </p>
            <p>
             This amazes me to no end.
            </p>
            <p>
             I spoke to a cop  last week  who said he was a christian but doesn't know much about the devil.
            </p>
            <p>
             To me, that would be like our army invading another country without a map.
            </p>
            <p>
             Completely insanely unbelievable  and  would never happen??
            </p>
            <p>
             But a Christian Cop fighting crime without knowing the enemy?
            </p>
            <p>
             Hasn't he thought about  - where - evil comes from?
            </p>
            <p>
             Has he not contemplated the types of situations where it emerges?
            </p>
            <p>
             I mean - really??
            </p>
            <p>
             Surely, he would have been eaten by a dinosaur had he lived in another time.
            </p>
            <p>
             I am really not following the whole - heaven and hell doesn't exist - logic

              I realize that when one is immersed in religion one cannot see much else.  Been there, done that.  I gave up religion because I found no evidence of a good god who acted in humans lives.  The Pizzagate issue surely is proof of that.  Not only do pastors and priest abuse kids, god does not step in to stop the abuse.  I have seen much evil.  That doesn't mean there is a supernatural being that is the sponsor of evil.  I have seen one chicken mother kill the babies of another.  I have seen chicks turn on a weak chick and kill it and even eat it.  In humans religious people would say that was the work of the devil.  Is there a chicken devil?
              <br/>
              Just because people do satanic rituals doesn't make it real.  They may believe it is real.  Some think the devil is not a supernatural being but an alien.  Some people think Jehovah is an evil alien - one of the ancient Annunaki.
              <br/>
              Religious people think there is only one way to interpret what they see in the world, and are convinced they have the TRUTH.  Unfortunately they often disagree and that is why there are so many religions, denominations, sects, churches, each saying they have a corner on the truth.
              <br/>
              At any rate, if there is a good and powerful god I call on that god to rescue the innocent and stop all this pedophilia.  I called on Jehovah and Jesus when I was a Christian.  I volunteered in Haiti working with sick kids.  They were the children of Christian parents.  My prayers and their parents prayers did not good.  The abuse and suffering in the world continues. 
At any rate don't forget that according to the Bible God created the Devil.  If he is all knowing then he knew the Devil would go bad, so why did he create him.  Seems like he is responsible therefore for the evil in the world as he created the supposed author of the evil.

              I believe heaven and hell most certainly exist. The devil is very real. PizzaGate spirit cooking is the proof of it. Why else would these elites engage this if it weren't real? They're not stupid. On the contrary these people extremely shrewd, cunning and intelligent - like mad geniuses / psychopaths.
             </p>
             <p>
              They would not waste an once of their energy engaging in this if it were all a mere figment of their imagination.
