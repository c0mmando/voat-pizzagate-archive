             But when either of the candidates makes it to the December special election, they both appear to underperform against Jones, who is polling at 40 percent when pitted against Strange, who polls at 43 percent. When pitted against Moore, Jones pulls 40 percent again, compared to Moore’s 44 percent.

            This article has a funny way of stating this but basically the Democratic candidate get 40% in polls whether running against Moore or his likely replacement if he steps down, Luther Strange (some Alabama politicians have "strange names" such as Public Service Commission President Twinkle Andress Cavanaugh :) )  At any rate it is unlikely that either Moore or Strange would be defeated so where is the incentive to get Moore out.  I imagine that since Trump supported Strange, many Republican politicians would be even more glad than the Democrats to have Moore out of the race.  He is a disruptive force in the party (removed twice from the Supreme Court for ethics violations).  He is unlikely to be a team player.  Alabama is a red state and for a democrat to get elected Gov or Representative of Senator is getting harder and harder.  The in crowd, the elites are often banded together against populists regardless of party.  But in Roy's case I doubt if he is a true populist but rather following the tradition of such people as George Wallace.  But I would if I had the chance vote Wallace over Moore.  Moore is a shameless self promoter.

            This whole story is irrelevant.  If the stories are correct I do not consider what he did if he did it pedophilia as such...he was an older man dating teenage girls which was not totally out of the norm for Alabama.  He went a bit far with one which is not totally out of the norm in dating, but he is not accused of having sex with any of the women.  He ended up marrying  a few years later a woman who was 24, so a bit older but clearly, like many men he preferred younger women.  But in the morals of the time the partial undressing and touching was not what good unmarried Christian men were supposed to do.  It does speak to the character of the man who has other moral failings, which is not unusual for those who try to make themselves a name as a hero Christian.  But even if he did nothing to these women he has other moral failings.  How many church leaders and super Christian politicians have to be exposed before Christians understand that there are many wolves in sheep's clothing out there.  The true hero Christians are out acting on the words of Jesus "Like as you have done it to the least of these my brethern..."  They are not seeking political power, building massive churches, making names for themselves....they are humbly walking as Jesus did, poor and among the poor, feeding and clothing the least of these...  Not dragging statues of the 10 Commandments around in the middle of the night...not to make Alabama more religious, but to make a name for himself.  Jesus was none to happy with those who use religion to make names for themselves....
Matthew 6:5-6 
“And when you pray, you must not be like the hypocrites. For they love to stand and pray in the synagogues and at the street corners, that they may be seen by others. Truly, I say to you, they have received their reward. But when you pray, go into your room and shut the door and pray to your Father who is in secret. And your Father who sees in secret will reward you."

            <p>
             Foundation for Moral Law
Moore founded the nonprofit Christian legal organization Foundation for Moral Law in 2002.[102] Moore's wife, Kayla, is the president of the Foundation for Moral Law. [103]
In 2005, Moore's Foundation for Moral Law accepted a $1,000 contribution from a neo-Nazi organization founded by Willis Carto, a prominent Holocaust denier. The donation attracted attention during Moore's 2017 campaign for a Senate seat.[104][105][106]
Undisclosed salary payments
Moore publicly said that he did not draw a "regular salary" from the organization, yet in October 2017, The Washington Post found that Moore had arranged an annual salary of $180,000 for himself from the foundation.[18] From 2007 to 2012, he collected more than $1 million; a number that far surpasses what the nonprofit declared in its public tax filings.[18] Furthermore, The Washington Post found that Moore arranged the salary, and in 2012 when the charity could not pay his full salary, Moore got a note promising that he would get the salary in back pay or a stake in the assets of the foundation.[18] The foundation also paid for Moore's health-care benefits, travel expenses, and bodyguard, and the foundation's website has regularly promoted Moore's speaking arrangements and book.[18] Furthermore, the foundation employed Moore's wife and at least two of Moore's children.[18] The Washington Post also noted that there was considerable overlap between the charity and Moore's political activities, with previous top officials of the charity leading Moore's 2017 Senate campaign and with the charity using the same fundraising firm as Moore's campaigns.[18]
The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) warned the foundation about discrepancies in its tax filings in 2013, saying that the issues "could jeopardize your exempt status".[18] A number of charity and tax law experts have said that the foundation's activities "raised questions about compliance with IRS rules, including prohibitions on the use of a charity for the private benefit or enrichment of an individual".[18] Additional reporting by The Washington Post that October found that the $498,000 that Moore was guaranteed in back pay was not declared to the IRS; tax experts say that it should have been and that Moore would have had to pay more than $100,000 in federal tax.[107]

             Are you going to keep spamming that ridiculous IRS story? You act like he's sitting down and calculating taxes. Spam the accountants he used if you believe something wrong.
            </p>
            <p>
             And the fourteen-year-old is the entire story. What was alleged would be pedophilia. The other jacked up pieces of shit complaining about being asked out reminds me of Amber Tamblyn. The one douchebag who was a sign interpreter for both Biden and Killary is suspect from the get go. I mean, what are the chances? But PLEASE keep posting the IRS bullshit. As if you understand anything about tax laws. And Wikipedia as a source? You do realize even nunchucks like you can post any shit they want? No, probably not. You're the de rigueur pedophile normalizer/apologist. Okay to molest little fourteen-year-old girls, but goddamn it, PAY YOUR FREAKIN' TAXES!!!!!

              I don't trust Wikipedia on many things but in fact they get many thing correct.  Al.com is a local paper and not known to be biased. In their own reporting they say:
             </p>
             <blockquote>
              <p>
               AL.com previously reported on the foundation taking out a second mortgage to pay Moore $465,000 in back pay at the same time it unsuccessfully fought a breach of contract lawsuit from a company that helped the charity raised funds.

               As the Foundation for Moral Law fought - unsuccessfully - a lawsuit against it by a firm that helped the nonprofit raise money, the organization with ties to U.S. Senate candidate Roy Moore took out a second mortgage on its Montgomery building to pay Moore years of back pay, federal court filings and Montgomery County probate records showed.  Meanwhile, it remains unclear years later who paid the $465,000 judgement against the foundation because the organization has not filed its taxes since 2014 and didn't report the payment in its most recently filed tax returns.

              so since Wiki is not to be trusted should we decide that none of these affairs happened.

              says that the IRS cracked down on someone claiming 20 ficticious kids.  Since they are the IRS should we  believe the woman and not the IRS.

              No, we can't always trust the IRS and Wiki but that doesn't mean that everything they reveal is wrong or politically motivated.  But if you want to have the wool pulled over your eyes by Roy Moore, a shameless self promoter who uses religion to get power I suggest you send all your money to some television preacher who promises you you will get 10 fold back and see how that works for you.  Some use religion to get rich, some to get power 
BTW Jesus said "Render to Caesar the things that are Caesar's; and to God the things that are God's."  He never tried to overthrow Rome but preached love and sharing.  Based on this verse I would say no Christian should ever enter politics.

               It's okay. I understand soul-less people don't get the whole idea of self-sacrifice, and doing good, and not molesting kids. You think people that profess loyalty to such a faith hypocrites while doing nothing to improve your own allegiance to The Cannibal Elite. Yeah, drinking Haitian orphan blood will improve your complexion and make you "keep" longer, but what about salvation? Ever think about what you'll do for that eternity burning in hell?
              </p>

               Those are the things you should consider because those are the things that are important.

            Creating a false narrative about pedo politicians is the goal right now, so it's easier for them to deny it later.  They're creating their own defense.

              You nailed it, that's exactly what they always do.  It's predictable at this point.  As soon as they accuse someone of something, you know they've already done it.

             Yeah, I could see that working. Working both ways actually. If the false narrative prevails, they win by knocking the politician out. If the politician prevails, they win because they can then use the defense that so-and-so was accused unjustly, so we must be innocent, too.

            This sounds like a run around.  Some body that lived here and worked there was married to a woman that heard from a friend in Alabama that some reporter approached her and offered her a lot of money to.......  Somehow I just can't wrap my head around this.  Sounds a little like my dog ate my homework story.

             Yes, I'm not sure what's going on here. At first blush, it seems contrived ... maybe second blush, too.
            </p>
            <p>
             I figured I'd post it to let others make up their mind. And the parts where she swears it's record and that she went to the authorities were of interest to me. Whether this website would perform due diligence and check out that claim? Don't know so it may be a big fat lie.
            </p>
            <p>
             The other part of this that I didn't include is a woman who swears that this "victim" accused several pastors of sexual impropriety. Those cases, allegedly, were dismissed. I decided not to include that because it seems like she could have given the names of the pastors ... or the churches ... or something.

              We will have to see how this plays out.  There is so much fake news it is hard to know the truth anymore.........It amazes me how easy it is for people to lie nowadays.  Sure, we had our share of liars years ago, but it seems there is so much more dishonesty, backstabbing and twisting of the truth.  Our Journalists have lost their way.
