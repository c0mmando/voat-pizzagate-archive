<p>Quote from the link;  “Governed by an independent Board of Trustees, The Heritage Foundation is an independent, tax-exempt institution. Heritage relies on the private financial support of the general public—individuals, foundations, and corporations—for its income, and accepts no government funds and performs no contract work. Heritage is one of the nation’s largest public policy research organizations. Its hundreds of thousands of individual members make it the most broadly supported think tank in America.”

<p>The Devos center, part of the Heritage in the USA, had to drop charges against two journalists, below link. </p>

<p>quote :  Two undercover filmmakers whose videos exposed abortion provider Planned Parenthood won’t face criminal charges after all. Instead, they’re hailing the news as a First Amendment victory for citizen journalists.On Tuesday, the Harris County district attorney’s office dismissed all charges against David Daleiden and Sandra Merritt. The duo worked undercover to produce a series of videos alleging Planned Parenthood’s involvement in the sale of unborn baby body parts. Federal law makes it illegal to sell human fetal tissue for a profit.”

<p>quote: &quot;Since 1989, Betsy DeVos and her relatives have given at least $20.2 million to Republican candidates, party committees, PACs and super PACs, according to an OpenSecrets.org analysis. (A tabbed spreadsheet is here.)  Amway, the multilevel marketing giant now known as Alticor that earned much of the family its wealth, gave another nearly $3.6 million to the party prior to 2002. And that’s just at the federal level — family members have given hundreds of millions more to state and local level politics and to nonprofit groups, think tanks and media outlets championing their favored conservative causes.&quot;/end quote.</p>
<p>So much for ending chronyism.  
</p>
<p>The American Heritage Foundation  says,  quote: “The Kathryn and Shelby Cullom Davis Institute for National Security and Foreign Policy promotes a stronger America and consists of the Douglas and Sarah Allison Center for Foreign Policy, the Margaret Thatcher Center for Freedom, the Asian Studies Center and the Center for National Defense.”</p>
<p>Note:  over course there’d be a link to an agency in the UK.   Why am I not surprised that the Margaret Thatcher Center for Freedom is a  Heritage Foundation.   Nile Gardiner  Is a writer at the Daily signal and  Director at the UK  Margaret Thatcher Heritage Foundation.   <a href="https://twitter.com/NileGardiner">https://twitter.com/NileGardiner</a>    and connected with  the American Heritage Fund.    He\'s writing the expose on the very people whom he\'s linked with.    
</p>
<p>A few things  most of these foundations have in common...  they all push charities, usually for children or schools,  they all seem to have connections in Asia, UK, etc, and they are linked with politics and often media.       
</p>
<p>These are the groups that have untold amounts of money and they run their respective country.  
</p>
<p>A fellow  pizzagate member is going to be submitting  a full expose on this  forum very soon.   
</p>
<p>.... stay tuned...   it\'ll be epic!  Guaranteed!</p>',
