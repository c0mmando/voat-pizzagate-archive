<p>This was what brought the entire memory back to me: <a href="http://archive.is/788N5">http://archive.is/788N5</a></p>
<p>Many years ago, through a friend, I was inside the house of either some kind of minister of or diplomat of Mexico and I was told before hand, you will not believe what you see inside this place. I was &quot;prepared&quot; for the fact that not only was the man ridiculously wealthy like WEALTHY wealthy- but the environment was particularly unique. It was.</p>
<p>I will describe it:</p>
<p>You come up an elevator, you walk out into a black hallway with huge silver bars like a bank vault. The bars are horizontal and open sideways, you can\'t miss them. I vividly remember them at the time.</p>
<p>You walk out of the little hallway and the entire place is more or less shaped like a spiral and as you walk out of the small part into the larger &quot;arm&quot; of the place, you open into a huge space. All of the walls are black marble from floor to ceiling, probably 30 feet high-massive vaulted space of black marble. There is a literal pool of flat water in the floor in the largest part of the open space. As you walk around, there are two massive sculptures from the artist, Damien Hirst, sort of like this one of his other works...
<a href="http://imgur.com/gxn8FVv">http://imgur.com/gxn8FVv</a></p>
<p>One sculpture was a skinned goat crucified on a cross like Jesus. The other was a skinned goat kneeling down in prayer holding rosaries in front of the crucified goat, praying to it. I remember not only being completely floored, but also thinking that most Mexican people I know are really religious and this seemed like...not Christian is all I can say about it, even though it was like the story or the scene of Jesus, but it wasn\'t at all-you know what I\'m saying? </p>
<p>When I saw the first link from the post from GothamGirl, I suddenly realized it\'s plausible to me that I could have been standing inside an occult space, which was made to look, or also was a &quot;rich man\'s&quot; apartment with &quot;odd taste in art&quot;. Looking back, it seems like a ritual space because it had a pool in it? And the bars could also keep people in, not just &quot;out&quot; or keep them from stealing. Now when looking back on it, all I can think is &quot;spirit cooking&quot; and black marble sacrifice spaces.</p>
<p>The more we all research the more it seems like they just seamlessly add this evil shit to our world in the most basic ways. I mean, art and pizza? That\'s the same thing with Alephantis and Comet Ping Pong. There was beheading art all over the place while kids were eating pizza and playing ping pong.</p>
<p>Ok, so this is starting to make me feel a little more sick, because I just checked and Demian Hirst\'s Dealer is this guy Larry Gagosian.</p>
<p>And someone on Voat already covered that Gagosian was or was almost indicted on trying to buy sex slaves:

<p>These people are sick. There is a little part at the bottom about this other artist Carl Andre who was tried for potentially murdering his wife, and I checked and he was also a &quot;Gagosian&quot; artist.</p>

            Yes, I didnn't mean to imply they weren't doing it for centuries, just that it was reported by the Europeans.  Not actually scrying as I unerstand it, which is "far seeing" events in other places or fortunes in the glass.  Thise was more ilke invocation and possible possession by their god - the glass acting as a sort of portal.

            There's a scene in the movie "Running Scared" that should be seen by anyone with interest / concern about modern occultism or organized child abuse.
           </p>
           <p>
            First , the entire scene and subplot has nothing to do with the main plot. Was it a form of exposure cloaked in a fictional film? A boy about 12 years old I'd say is trying to hide from some criminals because he witnessed a crime. He winds up in a parking lot at night and sees a van he thinks will be a good hiding place. When he opens the back door, there are 2 kids already sitting quietly in the back . The kids say nothing before a man opens the door to check on them and sees he now has 3.
           </p>
           <p>
            Fast forward and the kids are being led into an upscale apartment and shown around. I literally had a BPM jump when the tour led into a huge room that stepped down into what looked like a TV studio for a kids show of some kind. There were 2 top line camera rigs set up for trucking and panning painted colorfully. There was a segment with a school house set, etc. The only thing that made it clear at that point it was bad news was the entire floor was lined with clear plastic.
           </p>
           <p>
            I'll skip over some of the action to the point when the boy's mom turns up at the apartment and barges in. She had called first, which alerted the couple residing there. She even forces her way into the children's bedroom where the lights are off and 2 children are sleeping soundly. She then leaves after not finding her son. Only a few minutes pass and she's banging on their door again. She forces her way in again asking, "Photos, photos?" She realized there wasn't a single photo of the kids in the apartment!
           </p>
           <p>
            This time she digs further and finds a wide drawer lined with large surgical and veterinary tools including saws. She then opens an opaque glass door closet and her son falls out, arms bound behind him and face wrapped well with packing take. She is able to resuscitate him. The couple apparently killed the 2 children and placed them in the beds and bound the boy in the closet in just the short time the mother had left.
           </p>
           <p>
            Watch for yourself to learn what happens. The real feel of the setting is disturbing and I have to suspect it was based on the world in reality.

            Just adding that there was a famous black obsidian mirror at the top of the most important sacrificial pyramid in the days when Cortes conquered Tenochtitlan.  The Aztec god, I believe was a twin god, that was being sacrificed to was supposed to appear in the mirror and I believe possess the priest or something of that nature.  Remember there was so much blood sacrifice at those stone pyramids that they had built in sluices that ran down the sides for the blood to pour.  Point is - highly polished black obsidian was sacred of sacred to Aztec blood sacrifice culture.
           </p>
           <p>
            I believe the mirror really existed, but then passed into legend and was supposed to have been taken from the pyramid and used in occult practice in Europe - not entirely sure.

            If you're ever in Manhattan, go to the MOMA and check out the huge Francis Bacon painting. In retrospect the whole setting had a dark vibe, the architecture, lighting.
           </p>
           <p>
            DO NOT think an image search on the web will give you a sense of the experience. I privately looked up the painting online AFTER seeing the real thing and realized in horror that I had seen "inside" the painting, which became obvious when no image of it reproduced the experience. In short, human slaughterhouse.

            You described this so vividly, I felt like I was there. It HAD to be an occult room. Wish you could dish who the rich guy was but I understand your safety is more important than our curiosity. Thanks for sharing and glad you made it out!

            Yeah I hear you. It was a messenger I knew who went to pick up something---this is years ago---and he asked me did I want to come along to see while he went. It was a fluke event. Once in a lifetime. I realize now what it was and also why he wanted to show someone else...

             NO, it's ok. It was like, woah, that just snapped into place. I mean I had not completely forgotten about the place, but suddenly it was very vivid and I realized I was not in the place I thought I was...

            Wow.  The goat thing is really quite sick.  No Mexican people would not ordinarily be into that, most are very religious.  Something like that might freak them out, like it did yo u.  There have been goats sacrificed in forests that we have heard about like in the Ritual Sacrifices these devil worshipers do.  This very scary.  There is definitely something weird going on there.

            It seems very plausible in light of Pizzagate!

            In the world of Pizzagate it seems like 1 degree of separation.
