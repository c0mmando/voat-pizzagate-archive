<p>Ritualistic Abuse of Children: Dynamics and Impact</p>

<p>Excerpted from her paper:</p>
<p><strong>Abstract</strong></p>
<p>Ritualistic abuse of children is a severe form of child maltreatment that has only recently come to the attention of mental health professionals and law enforcement officials.  Ritualistic abuse involves the repetitive sexual, physical, and psychological abuse of children by adults who systematically and deliberately terrorize the child victims in order to prevent disclosure.  Ritualistic abuse may be intrafamilial, which is often intergenerational, or extrafamilial, which is often associated with day care settings.  As a result of this severe and multifaceted form of maltreatment, child victims experience persistent psychological disturbances.  This paper discusses the nature and impact of the physical, sexual, and psychological abuse reported by victims, as well as the phenomenon\'s implications for policy, practice, and research. </p>
<p>She goes on to mention:</p>
<p>Only one study to date has utilized standardized instruments to examine the impact of cult-based ritualistic abuse.  This study reported that 35 of 67 children who were sexually abused in day care centers nationwide had also been ritually abused (Kelley, 1988).  Ritualistic abuse was associated with significantly greater psychological distress as measured by the Child Behavior Checklist (Achenbach and Edelbrock, 1983).  </p>
<p>And then:</p>
<p>Therapists treating adults with multiple personality disorders have noted that a large percentage were ritualistically abused when they were children (Sachs and Braun, 1987; Lawson, 1987; Terry, Loomis, and Horowitz, 1987; Holland, 1987; Hopponen, 1987).  Some therapists believe that the overwhelming trauma of ritualistic abuse fosters the growth of dissociative defenses and contributes to the development of multiple personality disorders (Sachs and Braun, 1987; Holland, 1987).</p>
<p><strong>Implications for Policy, Practice, and Research</strong></p>
<p>Ritualistic abuse of children has important implications for practice, policy and research.  Reliable estimates of the incidence of ritualistic abuse are needed.  Child protective agencies and law enforcement need to categorize child maltreatment cases according to whether ritualistic abuse was involved.  Since most cases of ritualistic abuse involve multiple victims and multiple perpetrators, adequate resources must be made available to the agencies charged with investigating such allegations.  A multidisciplinary team approach with cooperation among investigating agencies is imperative in preventing further trauma to child victims and their families.</p>
<p>The media pay much attention to, but often sensationalize, cases of ritualistic abuse.  Since such attention is an additional source of stress for child victims and their families, professionals involved in cases of ritualistic abuse should attempt to shield victims from the media.  In addition, professionals familiar with ritualistic abuse should teach psychologists, physicians, nurses, social workers, police officers, child protective workers, judges, and prosecutors about the nature, dynamics, clinical indicators, and sequelae of ritualistic abuse.</p>
<p>The skepticism that reports of ritually abused children and adult survivors elicit is similar to the disbelief and horror incest victims faced only a decade ago.  Summit writes, &quot;we are willing to concede that girls may be at risk of sexual victimization by their fathers but we fight back at claims that diffuse into more sacred domains.  These forbidden sanctuaries include victimization of boys, women who are victimizers, and the unholy chimera of everything forbidden and impossible:  sexual abuse of boys and girls by men and women as part of bizarre, cultic rituals.&quot;  Summit further explains that the allegations made in cases of ritualistic abuse are <strong>&quot;so outrageous that reasonable people refuse to discuss them and believers are quashed into silence&quot;</strong>  (Summit, 1988, p. 56).</p>',

            This was written at about the height of Satanic Panic over ritual abuse in 1980's which was started after a book came out in 1980. 
Before this book came out there were virtually no claims of Satanic Ritual Abuse by the end of the decade there was thousands.
           </p>
           <p>
            Many, many claims were made at that time by quack therapists using dubious science and were completely debunked.   Patients with multiple personalities often did not initially show these symptoms at first, but having weeks of having a therapist hypnotize them, they would change.
           </p>
           <p>
            An FBI agent from the Behavorial Unit (a la Silence of the Lambs) was asked to consult on some of these cases in the early 80's.  He started to doubt these cases, when they allegations started to pile up and number in tens of thousands of victims, but there was little to none corrobarating evidence.  He went back and reviewed known cases and he couldn't find any that matched the details of Satanic Ritual Abuse.
           </p>
           <p>
            The book that started it, didn't stand up at all to scrutiny.  The therapist had used hypnosis on the patient for over a year.  In the book he describes a ritual his client suffered that went on for 81 straight days.  However, when reporters looked into these claims, the girl was accounted for during that time.  She was attending school normally.  Her sisters noticed nothing different about her.
           </p>
           <p>
            In 1990's a psychologist named Elizabeth Loftus started looking into the question of could a therapist using suggestive techniques and hypnosis implant a false memory in people.
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lost_in_the_mall_technique">
             A student of hers invented a scenario
            </a>
            where he had his family read several scenarios that had happened to the family, and asked them to write as much as they remembered about the scenarios.   One of the scenarios was false, that his brother was once lost in a mall at age five and found by an eldery person who returned him to his family.  His brother ended up remembering a lot of detail about this false event and was shocked when he was told it wasn't true.  This experiment that shows false memories can be implanted.  When they repeated the experiment with a college class, 25% of the subjects claim to remember a false memory.
           </p>
           <p>
            So to be as academic as you can get, you will need validate the claims in this 1988 article against the subsequent investigation and deeper scientific understand of memory to see if the claims hold up.

             I would reverse your premise, and suggest that you need to validate your claims that SRA is the result of false memories, etc.  You say, "Before this book came out there were virtually no claims of Satanic Ritual Abuse by the end of the decade there was thousands" but provide no source.  A nameless FBI Agent in a nameless department, anecdotes that implanting false memories is possible (of course it is possible, it is one of the very tactics used in the mind manipulation of abuse victims), a single instance of debunked claims by a reporter, and then you question the integrity and veracity of an article written by a registered nurse and doctor of psychology that utilized over 18 sources of peer reviewed works and academic studies of abuse victims at the graduate level or higher?  My friend I think you have it the other way around.  As I see it, the author is credible, her sources are scientific and academic, her argument is simple and lucid, and the existence of ritual abuse is now well established in our society.  See the video documentation in my other post to familiarize yourself with some of the better known cases that have been well documented over decades.  They are not isolated incidents.

             The true panic is that this has been going on for decades, at least decades, and still no significant action has been taken at the higher levels of leadership in our society.

              Yes, I provide no sources because this is common lived history.  I'm old enough to remember when this was going down and then when the cases were debunked.  Zealous prosecutors and therapists were actually harming children through coercive techniques.  Cops and therapists were being told not to believe children when they denied any abuse, they were being trained that children always deny abuse at first.  So they would browbeat the kids into giving "the right answer."  "The Right Answer" was always what the cops/therapists suspected.  Lots of innocent lives including the children's were ruined.
             </p>
             <p>
              I remember the
              <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McMartin_preschool_trial">
               McMartin Preschool case
              </a>
              and
              <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wee_Care_Nursery_School_abuse_trial">
               Kelly McMichaels case.
              </a>
              .  Once the hysteria died down, there was nothing to support the original charges.  In the McMichaels case a 25 year old teacher was accused of amputating boys penises and sodomizing children with a fork.  And yet no parent noticed anything wrong when they picked up their kids.  No penises were missing.  Despite wild unsupported charges like this she was convicted of 115 charges.

               False Memory Syndrome has zero scientific evidence. As a matter of fact, the term "False Memory Syndrome" was coined by a very suspicious group, who was put together by a husband and wife who's daughter confronted the father for raping her when she was a child. However, there are hundreds of studies on SRA. It is very real, and for some screwed up reason, isn't dealt with, but swept under the rug. EVERY TIME. Here's a list of convictions:

               I would also like to add that one of the shadiest connections to the false memory foundation happens to be Doug Mesner AKA Lucien Greaves of The Satanic Temple. 
Interesting, no?

            Another excellent post. It's a tragedy that instead of the above recommendations being followed, ritualistic abuse has been almost entirely erased from the public consciousness, and the concept of its very existence has been undermined. Wikipedia says "Satanic ritual abuse was the subject of a moral panic that originated in the United States in the 1980s", as though it never even really existed at all.
           </p>
           <p>
            A big question is, why was it at that time (late 1980s) that ritualistic abuse had only recently come to the attention of psychologists and law enforcement officials?

             Check out the Johnny Gosch story and Paul Bonacci connection.  Also the Larry King scandal (related to the Franklin scandal).  As I understand, those were some of the earlier and more high profile stories that broke.  And I've read the Wikipedia entry for SRA.  Total disinfo if you ask me.

              Thanks; I'm familiar with Gosch and Bonacci, but haven't read or watched everything out there about them. I'm learning more about the Franklin Scandal currently. Perhaps my question should have been, did ritual abuse become far more prevalent in the 1980s, leading to its exposure, and if so, why?

               Couldn't say for sure, but I would think that as the children of the first generation of victims became indoctrinated into the cult based programming and abuse regimens, the ranks swelled.  Additionally, the technology of mind control and the application of abuse was fine tuned and made more effective.  Better methods, a larger population, fast forwards another 20-30 years and we're on to the third or in some cases fourth generations of individuals being brought up inside the culture and system that includes ritual abuse.  As the numbers grew and as programming broke down (I have read and heard that changes in the body/brain around the age of 30 can cause disruption to programming) perhaps more attention was brought to the matter.  And as therapists began talking with each other at national events they realized they were experiencing similar phenomena which also gave the matter more credibility.  Just a deduction, don't really know for sure.
