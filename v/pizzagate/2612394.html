            Heh, look at the heroic deeds the "Israeli" fake jews pulled off when the (likely artificially created) Haiti earthquake occurred. Who would've thought that they would show up on the scene so early and with such advanced technology! I'm sure they had nothing but altruistic intentions in mind!
           </p>
           <p>
            Look at the fake jew controlled media go!

            "Israeli" fake jews don't want to donate their organs to their brethren (greedy even in death!) so the transplantable organs must come from somewhere, right? The endless Palestinian victims would do for some time, but of course fresh organs need to be brought from elsewhere too. Many of the prostitution victims (usually from Eastern Europe) are surely often harvested once they've served their other purposes, and for example, the "Israeli" instigated turmoil in the Near East, Syria in particular, has offered a great chance for more exploitation of not only the living, but also the dead.

            In the article, “Our sons plundered for their organs,” veteran journalist Donald Bostrom writes that Palestinians “harbor strong suspicions against Israel for seizing young men and having them serve as the country’s organ reserve – a very serious accusation, with enough question marks to motivate the International Court of Justice (ICJ) to start an investigation about possible war crimes.”1/

           </p>
           <p>
            An army of Israeli officials and apologists immediately went into high gear, calling both Bostrom and the newspaper’s editors “anti-Semitic.” The Israeli foreign minister was reportedly “aghast” and termed it “a demonizing piece of blood libel.” An Israeli official called it “hate porn.”

            Commentary magazine wrote that the story was “merely the tip of the iceberg in terms of European funded and promoted anti-Israel hate.” Numerous people likened the article to the medieval “blood libel,” (widely refuted stories that Jews killed people to use their blood in religious rituals). Even some pro-Palestinian writers joined in the criticism, expressing skepticism.

            Israel’s very first, historic heart transplant used a heart removed from a living patient without consent or consulting his family.
           </p>
           <p>
            In December 1968 a man named Avraham Sadegat (the New York Times seems to give his name as A Savgat) (2) died two days after a stroke, even though his family had been told he was “doing well.”
           </p>
           <p>
            After initially refusing to release his body, the Israeli hospital where he was being treated finally turned the man’s body over to his family. They discovered that his upper body was wrapped in bandages; an odd situation, they felt, for someone who had suffered a stroke.
           </p>
           <p>
            When they removed the bandages, they discovered that the chest cavity was stuffed with bandages, and the heart was missing.
           </p>
           <p>
            During this time, the headline-making Israeli heart transplant had occurred. After their initial shock, the man’s wife and brother began to put the two events together and demanded answers.
           </p>
           <p>
            The hospital at first denied that Sadegat’s heart had been used in the headline-making transplant, but the family raised a media storm and eventually applied to three cabinet ministers. Finally, weeks later and after the family had signed a document promising not to sue, the hospital admitted that Sadagat’s heart had been used.
           </p>
           <p>
            The hospital explained that it had abided by Israeli law, which allowed organs to be harvested without the family’s consent.  (3) (The United Nations Convention against Transnational Organized Crime includes the extraction of organs in its definition of human exploitation.)
           </p>
           <p>
            Indications that the removal of Sadagat’s heart was the actual cause of death went unaddressed.

            Director of forensic medicine on missing organs
           </p>
           <p>
            A 1990 article in the Washington Report on Middle East Affairs entitled “Autopsies and Executions” by Mary Barrett reports on the grotesque killings of young Palestinians. It includes an interview with Dr. Hatem Abu Ghazalch, the former chief health official for the West Bank under Jordanian administration and director of forensic medicine and autopsies.
           </p>
           <p>
            “There are indications that for one reason or another, organs, especially eyes and kidneys, were removed from the bodies during the first year or year and a half. There were just too many reports by credible people for there to be nothing happening. If someone is shot in the head and comes home in a plastic bag without internal organs, what will people assume?” (4)

              "fake jews"  is so very correct.  They are not the real ones.  The Zionists are out to rule the world and we must make sure people know the difference.  Just like the pope that sits in the vatican.  He is not a real priest.  Jesuits are NOT the society of Jesus as they profess to be.  They are FAKES too.

            Israel has admitted pathologists harvested organs from dead Palestinians, and others, without the consent of their families – a practice it said ended in the 1990s – it emerged at the weekend.
           </p>
           <p>
            The story emerged in an interview with Dr Yehuda Hiss, former head of the Abu Kabir forensic institute near Tel Aviv. The interview was conducted in 2000 by an American academic who released it because of the row between Israel and Sweden over a report in the Stockholm newspaper Aftonbladet.
           </p>
           <p>
            Channel 2 TV reported that in the 1990s, specialists at Abu Kabir harvested skin, corneas, heart valves and bones from the bodies of Israeli soldiers, Israeli citizens, Palestinians and foreign workers, often without permission from relatives.
           </p>
           <p>
            The Israeli military confirmed to the programme that the practice took place, but added: "This activity ended a decade ago and does not happen any longer."
           </p>
           <p>
            Hiss said: "We started to harvest corneas ... whatever was done was highly informal. No permission was asked from the family."

               God I hope so.  There is so much truth in here and the reason we are here.  The reason they are making so much money.  It all makes me want to vomit.  I have never read such horrid stuff as what they do to children.  May they all suffer what they themselves have done.  I am not a violent person, but they have brought it upon themselves.  These people are Not Human.

            was just looking into Israel's connections to Haiti child and organ trafficking post the earthquake cuz i was listening to a 2010 radio show with the late great michael colliins piper.  With all the talk on these boards about Silsby, Clinton, and various individuals supposedly involved in Haiti, I don't recall much on Israel even though from mainstream sources they were clearly first to respond and get on the scene and within months there were stories (even espoused by a british elected official) of Israeli involvement in child and organ trafficking.  See the following links:

             Israel always sends "rescue teams" to any earthquake they do this to get there fast to grab dead bodies for organs.

            I am not going to sugar coat this article.  It's gory and horrid and extremely graphic when writing about the stealing and transporting of the organs, etc.  But if this is not Pizzagate, then what is.  This is as nasty as it gets.  Yesterday many of you read about Joel Davis well this is the other half.  Highly recommended by me, who is usually too squeamish to read reports like this, but this is what I have been waiting for.  A truthful and in scope telling of the horrors of the organ harvesting market.  Ugly.

            The barbaric crimes of a multibillion dollar gangster business sanctioned and protected by the likes of Israel, Turkey and the United States is yet one more crime against humanity committed daily by the mass murdering cabal. Rather than accept the evils of global slavery and organ trafficking perpetrated by power and profit driven psychopaths with total impunity, the corrupt, criminal victimization of preying on and murdering poor humans to keep a few rich humans alive is morally reprehensible. The perps need to be held accountable while their victims need justice.

            I remember watching a video by David Duke about how Israel was the biggest way station in the world for victims of the white slave trade, according to a US State Department report.  That report was subsequently suppressed (imagine my shock!)

              Sorry, not without full corroboration from other sources. TheMillenniumReport is a disinfo site that has published highly questionable stuff in the past, such as this:
              <a href="http://themillenniumreport.com/2016/12/endgame-ii-the-antarctic-atlantis-and-ancient-et-ruins/">
               http://themillenniumreport.com/2016/12/endgame-ii-the-antarctic-atlantis-and-ancient-et-ruins/
              </a>
              . I was actually contemplating a "Possible Disinfo" flair but haven't had time to research whether that is warranted in this case.
