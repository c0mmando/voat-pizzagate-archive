I think the Wellcome was on Buck\'s Fishing and Camping. There was also much speculation as to the meaning of the restaurant name and whether James was actually a Rothschild.

<p>&quot;James Achilles Alefantis Great Grandfather was Evelyn Achille de Rothschild (1886-1917) ?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Evelyn Achille served as a Major in the Bucks Yeomanry, and was mobilized with his Regiment on the outbreak of the War.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;After all his death was a glorious one, killed when charging at the head of his men of Bucks.&quot;</p>

<p>Gallipoli- GREEK CONNECTION</p>
<p>In response, the Allies decided to launch a naval expedition to seize the Dardanelles Straits, a narrow passage connecting the Aegean Sea to the Sea of Marmara in northwestern Turkey. If successful, capture of the straits would allow the Allies to link up with the Russians in the Black Sea, where they could work together to knock Turkey out of the war.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;In the wake of the failed naval attack, preparations began for largescale troop landings on the Gallipoli Peninsula. British War Secretary Lord Kitchener appointed General Ian Hamilton as commander of British forces for the operation; under his command, troops from Australia, New Zealand and the French colonies assembled with British forces on the Greek island of Lemnos.&quot;  <a href="https://www.history.com/topics/world-war-i/battle-of-gallipoli-1">https://www.history.com/topics/world-war-i/battle-of-gallipoli-1</a></p>
<p>&quot;He (Evelyn Achille de Rothschild) was then sent to Gallipoli, where he was temporarily in command of the Regiment, but after three months there was invalided to the base.</p>

<p>BUCK\'S CAMPING AND FISHING ORIGINS?</p>
<p>&quot;Ascott is a hamlet and country house in the parish of Wing, Buckinghamshire (Bucks), England.[1][2] The hamlet lies completely within the boundary of the Ascott Estate; it is home to many of the estate and house staff.</p>
<p>Prior to the Norman Conquest there was an abbey at Ascott, that had been given by a royal to a Benedictine convent in Angiers. In 1415 however, the same year as the Battle of Agincourt, the convent was seized by the English church because it belonged to the French and awarded to the Convent of St Mary du Pre, near St Albans.</p>
<p>In the early 16th century the abbey (along with the manor of Wing) was seized by the Crown and given to Cardinal Wolsey, however not long after it was seized once again in the Dissolution of the Monasteries and given to Lord Dormer. It was in 1554 that Dormer entertained Princess Elizabeth at the house, when she was on the road to London under arrest as a Protestant because her sister Mary had just taken the throne.</p>
<p>The former abbey, now a house, itself once featured additions that were attributed to Inigo Jones. The house fell into decay following the death without heir of its owner the Earl of Caernarvon in 1709. In 1727 the house and estate were broken up, the deer sold and all the timber cut down and sold off. In the late 19th century members of the Rothschild banking family began to acquire estates in the area, including Ascott. In 1873 a farm house in the parish known as Ascott Hall was bought by Baron Mayer de Rothschild he gave it to his nephew Leopold de Rothschild who employed the architect George Devey to enlarge the property into a substantial country house. Today this is the National Trust property known as Ascott House or sometimes known more simply as just &quot;Ascott&quot;.</p>

<p>&quot;If architecture draws \'oohs\' and \'aahs\' from you, you can\'t beat Wrest Park. It features a stunning assortment of garden styles as well as a sculpture gallery and mansion that belongs in an Austen film. Meanwhile, the grandeur of Woburn Abbey was enough to tempt Queen Victoria. It must have been Woburn\'s superb collection of artwork, lovely gardens and extensive deer park that got the queen interested. Round it all off with Ascott House, which is believed to date from the early 17th century, and the beautiful landscapes of Ascott Park.</p>
<p>Enough of buildings, let\'s get some fresh air! Bedfordshire has a kaleidoscope of greenspaces, starting with the Dunstable Downs and the Whipsnade Estate. The Dunstable Downs are located in the Chilterns Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty (AONB) and are the highest point in Bedfordshire. The Harrold-Odell Country Park is also a lovely place to explore on foot, with walking routes, play areas for children and fantastic chainsaw carvings as you rable through the park. It also has two lakes and part of the River Great Ouse flows through it, all ideal for fishing. &quot;</p>

            When I first started posting about the Wellcome Trust 1.5 years ago it was met with huge resistance by the former mod MF which told me that I was onto something.

             Burroughs Wellcome in GB also has a HQ in NC.....At the Raleigh Research Park....many large mental hospitals close by as well as Ft Bragg and Duke University  , both have been implicated in MKULTRA programming. Lot more going on there than meets the eye. ..other big pharma HQs , Charlotte is not too far away....US banking capital, not NYC. Soon  war games will be  going on and the area is weird anyway....all of these institutions are close to each other.Eerily similar to 9/11 when NORAD was busy doing war games.https://truepundit.com/special-forces-launch-war-drill-in-21-north-carolina-counties-next-week/?fbclid=IwAR2gEVzAar5Chz5bjkLu6At2qK3kP_TyQdf8ak7UXXreoH8c_fKqwLlf

             Great research! You should do an updated one and repost. Fits in with Epstein's science angle.

              Actually I've just found an interesting link with Nicole Junkermann.  Trying to do the post now.  The connections have overloaded  my brain so I'm just going to compile the links and post. This stuff is exhausting.
