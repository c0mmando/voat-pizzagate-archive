The CDKL5 gene provides instructions for making a protein that is essential in forming the connections for normal brain development, with mutations causing a deficiency in the protein level. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Pharma is a bit of a favourite of mine because of  the strange collection of people present in the OC during the week of 29 april to 5th May. More medical doctors than statistically one might expect (quite apart from the Tapas 9) a few financial experts, one of whom an expert on PFI, someone working at Porton Down, a few industrials who could easily afford better accommodation. It does look more like it was a pharma freebie - just my opinion - but reasonable taking into account those present </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Note the reference to Astrozeneca, one of the companies in the Independent newspaper article on pharma bribery of NHS doctors..</p>
<blockquote>
<p>John McCann and his employment as something or other - not a chemist developing  any kind of drug I\'d think  but more likely as a representative. With AstroZeneca being so very accommodating in the early days and yet no break showing in J.McCann\'s CV on linked-in, plus the fact that Astrozeneca had just merged with a laboratory in Huelva I\'ve always seen him as an essential part of the enterprise. As indeed he was, taking his place on the board of the ltd. co. and deputising for his brother here and there. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Gerry McCann\'s brother used to work for them:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>One of seven directors of the Find Madeleine Fund, Gerry McCann\'s brother has taken indefinite leave of absence from his job as a medical rep for the pharmaceutical company AstraZeneca in order to administrate the £1m fund from his Glasgow sitting room.  </p>

            John McCann and his employment as something or other - not a chemist developing  any kind of drug I'd think  but more likely as a representative. With AstroZeneca being so very accommodating in the early days and yet no break showing in J.McCann's CV on linked-in, plus the fact that Astrozeneca had just merged with a laboratory in Huelva I've always seen him as an essential part of the enterprise. As indeed he was, taking his place on the board of the ltd. co. and deputising for his brother here and there.

             <p>
              This book tells the story of the International Rescue Committee (IRC), the largest nonsectarian refugee relief agency in the world. Founded in the 1930s by socialist militants, the IRC attracted the support of renowned progressives such as Eleanor Roosevelt, Norman Thomas, and Reinhold Niebuhr. But by the 1950s it had been absorbed into the American foreign policy establishment. Throughout the Cold War, the IRC was deeply involved in the volatile confrontations between the two superpowers and participated in an array of sensitive clandestine operations.
              <strong>
               The IRC thus evolved from a small organization of committed activists to a global operation functioning as one link in the CIA's covert network.
