            I would recommend giving money to your local women's shelter or homeless shelter.
           </p>
           <p>
            Trafficking and abuse victims often get victimised again in adulthood, and are also far more likely to become homeless (a significant number of homeless people suffer from PTSD).
           </p>
           <p>
            You can also ring them and ask what kind of goods they would be happy to receive as donations. Often they are happy to get (used) clothes and children's toys. Sometimes it's something seeemingly 'small' that can help
            <em>
             tremendously
            </em>
            - like buying proper clothes for a woman that needs them for a job interview, or providing a deposit so that someone will be able to rent a flat. This is the kind of help that can help changing someones life.
           </p>
           <p>
            You can phone and ask if they have women/kids/men who have these special kind of needs - often the shelters are not able to cover costs like this from the funds they have.
           </p>

            The only nationwide charity I can recommend is SNAP - Survivors Network of those Abused by Priests.
           </p>
           <p>
            Their website is:
            <a href="http://www.snapnetwork.org">
             http://www.snapnetwork.org
            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            They have done great, great work over the years to raise awareness about sexual abuse, they advocate for survivors, and are also lobbying for the abolishment of statutes of limitation.
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             The Survivors Network of those Abused by Priests, known as SNAP, established in 1989, is a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization support group of survivors of clergy sexual abuse and their supporters in the United States.
            </p>
            <p>
             SNAP's mission is to protect those who are vulnerable to child sexual abuse, to heal those who have been wounded, and to prevent future abuse. It exposes predators and those who shield them, helps members share stories so they are empowered, and educates communities about the impact of abuse.

The OSCE Mission in Kosovo (OMIK) was established in supoprt to the UN UInterim Mission (UNMIK).  The 500 American mebers of the UNMIK police were Dyncorp employess under contract from the US State Department..DynCorp; Vinnell, a subsidiary of TRW; SAIC; ICI of Oregon; and Logicon, a unit of Northrop Grumman

            The OCSE chose WHO got sent to Bosnia/Yougoslavia..Resumés were collecterd and studied and only the finest pedophiles were sent..
In Bosnia, employees of DynCorp were found to be operating a sex-slave ring of young women who were held for prostitution after their passports were confiscated. In Croatia, local forces, trained by MPRI, used what they learned to conduct one of the worst episodes of "ethnic cleansing," an event that left more than 100,000 homeless and hundreds dead and resulted in war-crimes indictments. No employee of either firm has ever been charged in these incidents....http://emperors-clothes.com/news/fired.htm

Solana became a distinguished leader in the Spanish telecommunications industry and was one of the first socialist members of the Trilateral Commission. On 5 December 1995, Solana became the new Secretary-General of NATO..during which time there was the Kosovo war..

            , we require at least one link in every research post. Could you edit yours to add one -- maybe the one suggested in the comments? Also, please check out our submission rules in the sidebar (view desktop site if on mobile). I'll give you our 24 Hour Grace flair, so you can edit. Thanks.

            Check your local agencies. I recently held a small bake sale at my office and gave the money to a local organization that helps get women being trafficked , off the street and gives them a safe place to stay until they can get their lives back together.  I suppose the smaller organizations can be just as prone to corruption as the bigger ones . I just did some research and chose them because I couldn't find any dirt on them. That doesn't mean there isnt any.

             I'm not willing/able to take that on. I know from my short time sitting on the board of a simple dog rescue charity that such an endeavor is way beyond the scope of what I have the time or stamina to commit to. Maybe that makes me a bad person, but I think it's really just that I'm finally mature enough to know my limits intimately

              This. It's good to know your limits. Everybody can help in a different way.

              You know if you every find one, you can donate.  But how about helping a child at one of those reading programs.  A lot of cities have them and you donate your time helping them learn to read.  I have done this and it is so very rewarding.  You don't know how appreciative they are. This will keep them out of trouble and hopefully off the streets.
