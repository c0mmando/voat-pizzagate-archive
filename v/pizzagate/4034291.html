<p>Just read an interesting article in The Palm Beach Post, on the front page : &quot;Uber passenger says driver raped her&quot; When I started reading this alarm bells started ringing. <strong>Seems the alleged rapist Gary Timothy Kitchings was \'House Parent&quot; at foster homes</strong>.Kitchings recently worked at the <strong>KidSafe Sanctuary in West Palm Beach and Place of Hope also in W Palm</strong>.He worked in foster homes in Florida,North Carolina and Pennsylvania. The story said Kitchings and his wife had been house parents at various organizations for 17 years BEGINNING AT FATHER FLANAGAN\'S BOYS TOWN in Omaha Nebraska !! <strong>There\'s a photo with him alongside our Franklin buddy Oliver North.</strong> He publishes blogs where he discussed his &quot;career as a behavior-modification specialist&quot; He wrote one story about an aging assassin confronting a demon.Strange stuff.</p>

             Just read an interesting article in The Palm Beach Post, on the front page : "Uber passenger says driver raped her" When I started reading this alarm bells started ringing.
             <strong>
              Seems the alleged rapist Gary Timothy Kitchings was 'House Parent" at foster homes
             </strong>
             .Kitchings recently worked at the
             <strong>
              KidSafe Sanctuary in West Palm Beach and Place of Hope also in W Palm
             </strong>
             .He worked in foster homes in Florida,North Carolina and Pennsylvania. The story said Kitchings and his wife had been house parents at various organizations for 17 years BEGINNING AT FATHER FLANAGAN'S BOYS TOWN in Omaha Nebraska !!
             <strong>
              There's a photo with him alongside our Franklin buddy Oliver North.
             </strong>
             He publishes blogs where he discussed his "career as a behavior-modification specialist" He wrote one story about an aging assassin confronting a demon.Strange stuff.

            From my recollection, KIDSAFE has come up in our research forays into GROOMING CHILDREN via TOYS, CARTOONS, EDUCATION SOFTWARE, ONLINE CHATROOMS/SOCIAL NETWORKS, and GAMES. Their most notable/incriminating connection is CARTOON NETWORK who we have seen an overwhelmingly amount of adult and unsafe content come from. They also certify PEPA THE PIG , CRAYOLA (Plano TX) , BEN 10, and PLAYMATES TOYS.

             Okay I still felt like there was something with PLAYMATES TOYS and ALEX/ANDER CHOW YU CHUN.
            </p>
            <p>
             So I checked out their website again and noticed they have a prominent BADGE : Kids Safe Seal .

            Kids Safe Seal focusses on being the cyber sec&gt;urity arm of children's chat rooms, online games, learning portals, social media etc aimed at ages 0-5 5-10 10-16. Knowing how many predators use online kids games to access victims, and that Playmates Toys which was certified belonged to a suspected predator, this raised a red flag.

             Could be nothing, but this list seems to be a better lead than the toys, as these companies are already in our children's homes (computer/device).

            <p>
             Focused on anti-bullying and cyberspace safety for two decades, KidSafe Foundation unveiled bigger plans at an annual fundraiser.  “We’re going from grassroots to expand our reach to go national,” board chairman Peter Oldbury said at KidSafe’s Boca Chamber Festival Days Monday evening.

             <strong>
              Congressman Ted Deutch
             </strong>
             and his district director Wendi Lipsich were among KidSafe’s longtime supporters there Monday. “I support what they do,” Deutch said.
            </p>
            <p>
             Lipsich is the founding board secretary. “I’ve been with them since the beginning,” she said. “They will do everything it takes until every school is educated about [cyber] safety.”
