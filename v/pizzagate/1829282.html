<p>Came across this nice fellow who ran against Bernie Sanders in 2006, and lost. Tarrant was spitting out pretty low-brow ads against Sanders during this campaign, accusing him of, basically, being a pedo protector. An example of what I mean follows.</p>

<p>You can dig more into this side if you like, but my focus here will be on the accuser, Mr. Tarrant.</p>
<p>You see, since losing to Sanders (by 33 points, heh), Tarrant, himself a pretty well-to-do business guy, decided to take it upon himself to start the Tarrant Foundation.</p>
<p><a href="http://tarrantfoundation.org/">http://tarrantfoundation.org/</a></p>
<p>Which also has an &quot;institute&quot; at UVM, supposedly geared towards middle school students (from what I\'m reading).</p>
<p><a href="http://www.uvm.edu/tiie/">http://www.uvm.edu/tiie/</a></p>
<p>Now for this institute\'s Twitter.</p>
<p>Oh, already, we see a concern that kids need to fight fake news! And let\'s put a photo of friggin\' CPP! OF COURSE!</p>

<p>The only couple of photo references to food I found...well, judge for yourself, but not surprising.</p>

<p>Cabot Cheese sends supplies.</p>
<p>And, of course...</p>

<p>Pizza, &quot;the key to successful student interviews&quot;.</p>
<p>Also, FWIW, this Institute follows dear Bill Gates and his foundation. What\'s with these people and foundations, anyway?</p>
<p>As for the food references--clearly, these things seem to just be food. I just thought the only two foods found in the feed being pizza and cheese were...interesting.</p>
<p>So, I ask those of you more skilled than I am at the digging--what can we find on Tarrant the post-election foundation builder? For that matter, I couldn\'t find anything of interest in this area on Sanders (other than trying to get along with creepy Schumer and Pelosi to shift the crappy Dems, maybe), but can you?</p>',
