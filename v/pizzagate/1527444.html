            I believe the first use of a similar term was by researcher David McGowan. He's considered more of a conspiracy theorist than mainstream source. Here's "The Pedophocracy":

            The concept as I know it is that basically a lot of the ruling elite are into pedophilia. In the US for example accounts of survivor Cathy O'Brien implicate Presidents and media stars, but might not be considered credible. More in the mainstream, the Dutroux scandal in Belgium revealed that top businessmen and royalty and the like attended organized 'pink ballets' to molest young girls; top level police also attended to keep an eye on things. In the UK the Savile scandal has implicated media stars and top politicians in child abuse rings also. There are rumors of royal involvement; certainly Prince Andrew was involved in a scandal with one of Epstein's girls, Virginia Roberts.

            Pedo-dollar is a take-off of petro-dollar (the concept that worldwide oil sales have to be paid in US dollars). If there is such a slave trade as the basis of Saudi oil trade obviously that would be explosive but it's well hidden. Intriguingly, it's common knowledge nowadays that ISIS engages in the slave trade of women and female children (Middle Eastern though) and pretty clear that the West and Saudis have been supporting ISIS.

             I agree with your sentiments SaneGoatiSwear.

            <p>
             I naively attempted to answer the question (and got voated -1, oh how awful :) ). Also the submission grew about 3 times bigger than when I answered, a couple of hours ago, with lots of links added, it was originally the text only. Author loves and may have coined the term 'pedo-dollar'.
