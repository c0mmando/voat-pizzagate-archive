            Interesting thought.... There is some speculation that Slender Man is a Tulpa, a thoughtform manifested by the collective subconscious. He does have some very Podestalike qualities for sure.  So what came first? is Slendie a creation of Skippy's dark magic? Is Skippy possessed by Slendie? Was Slendie created by the fear, pain and emotional charge Skippy and the like create in their victims?
           </p>
           <p>
            Now obviously all this is mumbo jumbo, and really there are more down to earth avenues to pursue, but like the pepe and kek stuff, reality is currently showing itself to be rather more wonderful and flexible than most of us are programmed to accept.
           </p>
           <p>
            My own take on this, is just maybe Slendie is coming home, back to his source, the darkness that has infected our world....I wonder if we can meme magic him into these sick people's imagination's....so they are haunted by his deep dread, the kind they gain such pleasure form inflicting on others....would be a perfect kind of Karmic rebalancing and a fitting punishment for the likes of Skippy

             Facial shape-minus the baby fat in the cheeks, long and thin eyebrows, eye shape and seems similar, nose shape and length does also.  Hair color is the same, although the adult hair is styled and curled, the bangs are straight.  I note that the report describes her as a blond, which does seem odd unless she had dyed her hair recently and there was no photo.  It's interesting also that the mysterious Eric Knudsen has copyright and Hollywood has already prepared a bunch of films to come out.  In what is supposed to be Hillary's first term.
