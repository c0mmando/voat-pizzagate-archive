<p>MILWAUKEE – former president of Marquette Univ has asked the school to remove his name from a new residence hall.
The Rev. Robert Wild made the request because he believes he mishandled accusations of sexual abuse against three members of his Jesuit order in Chicago more than 25 years ago.
Wild said in a letter Tuesday that looking back, he would have handled &quot;certain aspects&quot; of those cases differently than he did then. </p>
<p>Wild, along with other Jesuit leaders in Chicago, is accused of ignoring and/or concealing information on pedophiliac priest the Rev. Donald McGuire. McGuire, 80, is currently serving a 25-year prison sentence for numerous sexual abuse cases over four decades.</p>
<p>On Monday, a motion was filed in two Chicago court cases. The motioned documents showed a repeated attempt to conceal and enable McGuire to continue serving.</p>
<p>“I have never seen such detailed and frequent notice received by the priest’s superiors, so many ‘directives’ regarding the priest’s future behavior, and so much evidence presented to his superiors that those directives were being violated, without the priest being removed from ministry,” Terence McKiernan, the group’s president.</p>
<p>Current Marquette President Michael Lovell says the school\'s board unanimously agreed with the request.</p>
<p>Wild indicated in a letter to the university\'s BOT that he wants his name removed because he regrets not using his authority to do more to protect victims and prevent future clergy abuse. Here\'s a portion of that letter:</p>
<p>&quot;As a Jesuit, Catholic priest, I am filled with sorrow  at any incident of abuse committed by a religious leader. While those feelings cannot atone for what people endured who have been sexually abused, I still want to express my regret for their suffering and for the terrible wrongs done by their abusers.
&quot;As Provincial Superior of the Chicago Province of the Society of Jesus (the Jesuits)  I was invested with authority over all Jesuits belonging to that particular three-state region. During my six years in office, accusations of sexual abuse of minors were lodged against three of our members. Looking back, I would have handled certain aspects of those cases rather differently than I did then. The restrictive measures I thought quite sufficient to restrain the behavior of one of those priests,  proved in practice to be insufficient to do so. I very much regret that and apologize especially to those victimized for my mistakes in that regard.
&quot;In a recent letter to the whole Church, Pope Francis describes the sexual abuse of minors and other vulnerable people as something demonic and cites in that connection Matthew 17:21, where Jesus explains to his disciples, “This class of demons can only be expelled by prayer and fasting.” After much thought and prayer, and careful consideration, I have decided that one aspect of the “fasting” I should undertake is to formally request that Marquette University remove my name from our new residence hall complex. Therefore,  I formally request that the University remove my name from the building that was recently named for me.&quot; </p>
<p>Guilt huh ?</p>
<p>I respect Father Wild’s decision . We are in agreement with Father Wild that this is the right decision for both Marquette and survivors of clergy abuse. The residence hall, which includes Ray and Kay Eckstein Tower and Wells St. Hall, will be known as The Commons. We have tremendous respect for Father Wild and are grateful for his leadership as Marquette’s president . Anyone who knows Father Wild understands that he values the Gospel message of love and forgiveness and we move forward together as a Marquette community in that spirit. We offer our prayers for continued strength and healing for all survivors of clergy abuse.&quot;</p>

<p>THE JESUITS BUILD THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA 
So the Jesuits set their sights on the New World and began designing a new form of government, one that would, on the public surface, appear to grant freedom and liberty (on paper, at least) to its citizens with the secret intent of creating a slave state of dutiful taxpayers and obedient workers. News of this new form of government and rule spread across Europe and attracted some of the brightest minds, who emigrated to the New World in search of prosperity, freedom of religion, and freedom of speech, among other promises of independence.</p>
<p>may Father Wild rot in hell.</p>

            This combined with the Jesuits West releasing the names of 111 "credibly accused" pedophiles shows that the Jesuits are in crisis mode. They are trying to preempt with confessional PR moves.
           </p>
           <p>
            Many Jesuit institutions in California, Oregon, And Washington have sent out letters to students claiming they've changed internal abuse report practices and assuring their flocks that they will be voluntarily undergoing a self initiated internal investigation  in in 2019.
           </p>
           <p>
            The worst part is they ask abuse survivors to self-report to the Jesuits West so they can "help them"

            , please provide some corroboration for the claim that "Jesuits" built the United States and were behind the construction of its government. The Millennium Report is a fake news site we have caught pushing multiple fantastical assertions and disinformation over the years and does not meet our Rule 2 evidence requirement. You have 24 hours to edit.

            Take a population, slice into two parts, control each part by pitting the two groups against each other in as many ways as possible, so members of the two parts see each other as mortal enemies. Repeat as necessary until you achieve the desired result, which is subjugation of the entire population. It has worked well in every single country the Jesuits have conquered, when they were unable to control an entire population as a whole.
