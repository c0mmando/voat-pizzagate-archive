<p>Major aspects of pizzagate have already been tied exhaustively to the CIA: the Washington Post, John Podesta, the residents of the Comet PingPong neighborhood, etcetc. Esalen is linked to Tavistock, an organization already infamous for developing mass mind control techniques.

<p><strong>D. Ewen Cameron:</strong>
Cameron worked at the Allen Institute at McGill, another famous CIA institution. His experiments were so bad, that victims later sued the CIA and were given some compensation. </p>

<a href="http://www.serendipity.li/cia/slprm.html">http://www.serendipity.li/cia/slprm.html</a></p>
<p>From his wiki page: &quot;He has been criticized for administering <strong>electroshock therapy</strong> and experimental drugs to patients without their informed consent. Some of this work took place in the context of the Project MKUltra mind control program.[6]</p>

<p><strong>B.F. Skinner :</strong>
Skinner visited Esalen and his work is also catalogued there. He developed operant conditioning - the &quot;Skinner Box.&quot; This included electrocution and flashing lights. (cough skippy video)</p>

<p>&quot;Modern operant conditioning chambers typically have many operanda, like many response levers, two or more feeders, and a variety of devices capable of generating many stimuli, including <strong>lights, sounds, music, figures, and drawings. Some configurations use an LCD panel for the computer generation of a variety of visual stimuli.</strong></p>
<p>Some operant chambers can also have <strong>electrified nets or floors so that shocks can be given to the animals; or lights of different colors that give information about when the food is available</strong>. Although the use of shock is not unheard of, approval may be needed in countries that regulate experimentation on animals.&quot;</p>

<a href="http://archive.is/eoUkv">http://archive.is/eoUkv</a></p>
<p>&quot;...West did his psychiatry residency at Cornell University, an MKUltra institution and site of the Human Ecology Fund.[4][5] He later became a subcontractor for MKUltra subproject 43, a $20,800 grant by the CIA while he was chairman of the department of Psychiatry at the University of Oklahoma. The proposal submitted by West was titled &quot;Psychophysiological Studies of Hypnosis and Suggestability” with an accompanying document titled “Studies of Dissociative States&quot;.[6]</p>
<p>&quot;One of the more unusual incidents of West\'s career came in August 1962, when he and two co-workers attempted to investigate the phenomenon of musth by dosing Tusko, a bull elephant at the Lincoln Park Zoo in Oklahoma City, with LSD.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;He performed Jack Ruby\'s psychiatric evaluation, and he was in charge of UCLA\'s department of psychiatry and the Neuropsychiatric Institute for 20 years. He was also active in anti-death penalty activism.[1]&quot;</p>

<p>Skinner\'s Box helps to explain topics that have already been brought up re: MKULTRA, as well as more bizarre pieces of the puzzle such as the &quot;fatherhood&quot; Skippy video. The surreal flashing lights, and bright colors sound like something straight out of the description of a horrible human version of a Skinner\'s Box. </p>
<p>It also makes sense that <strong>Adam Crabtree</strong> of Esalen specializes in <strong>Dissociated Identity Disorders.</strong>   <a href="http://www.esalen.org/ctr/people/adam-crabtree-phd">http://www.esalen.org/ctr/people/adam-crabtree-phd</a></p>
<p>&quot;Adam Crabtree is a psychotherapist in private practice, specializing in dissociative identity disorder and other dissociative disorders... He is author of Multiple Man: Explorations in <strong>Possession and Multiple Personality</strong> &quot;

<p><strong>Ed Kelly</strong>* is another central figure at Esalen currently. He works in &quot;he used EEG and fMRI neuro-imaging techniques to study somatosensory cortical plasticity in humans... his central long-term research interests, which revolve around mind/brain relations, and functional neuro-imaging studies of altered states of consciousness and psi.&quot;

           "Modern operant conditioning chambers typically have many operanda, like many response levers, two or more feeders, and a variety of devices capable of generating many stimuli, including
           <strong>
            lights, sounds, music, figures, and drawings. Some configurations use an LCD panel for the computer generation of a variety of visual stimuli.
           </strong>
          </p>
          <p>
           Some operant chambers can also have
           <strong>
            electrified nets or floors so that shocks can be given to the animals; or lights of different colors that give information about when the food is available
           </strong>
           . Although the use of shock is not unheard of, approval may be needed in countries that regulate experimentation on animals."

           Skinner's Box helps to explain topics that have already been brought up re: MKULTRA, as well as more bizarre pieces of the puzzle such as the "fatherhood" Skippy video. The surreal flashing lights, and bright colors sound like something straight out of the description of a horrible human version of a Skinner's Box.

            FYI, I've done a MASSIVE amount of research into the Esalen Institute, et al, and their ties to the CIA and the MKULTRA program. I've done probably over 100 shows on this topic and I maintain a very large database mapping this institute's connections to the intelligent community.
           </p>
           <p>
            I note that someone else here has mentioned my work already, but it's at www.gnosticmedia.com
           </p>
           <p>
            You can also access my research database directly, here.

           <p>
            The Esalen Institute was funded / launched by CIA / MI6 agent Aldous Huxley with his gay lover Gerald Heard. Aldous put Michael Murphy and Dick Price in charge, and one of the CIA/MKULTRA founders, Gregory Bateson, oversaw the organization as well. Most of the top people there are connected directly to the Harvard Social Relations Dept. - which was headed by CIA agent Henry A. Murray who worked on MKULTRA. Others in Murray's department included Dick Price, Tim Leary, Ted Kaczynski, BF Skinner, and others who participated heavily in the CIA's MKULTRA program.
           </p>
           <p>
            Essentially what I discovered is that the entire counterculture / 60s psychedelic revolution is actually the real MKULTRA program, and not this "Manchurian candidate" that was a red herring to mislead people.
           </p>
           <p>
            I've also done extensive research on all of the leading books on MKULTRA, such as Acid Dreams, Operation Mind Control, Storming Heaven, etc, and shown that they are all bullshit books written by the intel community to mislead investigation into MKULTRA and the counterculture which I exposed in my article Spies In Academic Clothing, here:
            <a href="http://www.gnosticmedia.com/SpiesinAcademicClothing_MKULTRA">
             http://www.gnosticmedia.com/SpiesinAcademicClothing_MKULTRA
            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            Those claiming here that Tavistock was connected to Nazi experiments, this is largely bullshit as Tavistock, the Frankfurt School and the AJC, and Macy Foundation, all a part of MKULTRA, were Jewish organizations.
           </p>
           <p>
            "I know you have done work with an anon on this. I know the historical connections of Nazi experiments of mind control, development of Tavistock with Freud personal testimony involving escalen"
           </p>
           <p>
            The Nazi thing is mostly a red herring, and misdirection in what was clearly a Jewish / Zionist operation. People seriously need to stop already with the anti-Germanic nonsense that squashes any real investigation. We have enough "Nazi" BS with the fraudulent Fiona Barnett and her Nazi Witchhunt in Australia.

            Dr. Harris Isbell performed drug experiments on prison inmates for the CIA.  He seemed to care little about the recipient's reaction to the drugs that he administered.
           </p>
           <p>
            The following quotes are from the PDF of the book "The Search for the Manchurian Candidate" by John Marks found here:

           </p>
           <p>
            Page 44: Dr. Harris Isbell, whose work the CIA funded through Navy cover with the approval of the Director of the National Institutes of Health
           </p>
           <p>
            Page 45: [Isbell] kept seven men on LSD for 77 straight days. Such an experiment is as chilling as it is astonishing
           </p>
           <p>
            Page 45: To Dr. Isbell, it was just another experiment. "I have had seven patients who have now been taking the drug for more than 42 days," he wrote in the middle of the test
           </p>
           <p>
            Page 45: Filled with intense curiosity, Isbell tried out a wide variety of unproven drugs on his subjects. Just as soon as a new batch of scopolamine, rivea seeds, or bufotenine arrived from the CIA or NIMH, he would start testing.
           </p>
           <p>
            Page 87: In Kentucky, Dr. Harris Isbell ordered psilocybin injected into nine black inmates at the narcotics prison.

            Dr. D. Ewen Cameron was a vile man.  He apparently didn't need the CIA's encouragement to perform his experiments, but he did accept their money when offered.  There's much more on him here,

            I was looking up Esalen, as I was involved with a meditation teacher who taught Gestalt Therapy there in the 70's and 80's and came across the name of a town in Colorado called Crestone / Baca Grande.  Crestone and is home to (2011) 25 spiritual centers.  Here's a link to one of the articles:
           </p>
           <p>
            <a href="http://911nwo.com/?p=2132">
             http://911nwo.com/?p=2132
            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            Now the reason I am linking this is because it is touted in the article as:
           </p>
           <p>
            "The Vatican City of the New World Order"  and then this:
           </p>
           <p>
            "Various reports indicate that visitors to Crestone have included such extremely high-powered personages as Laurence Rockerfeller, David Rockerfeller, Robert McNamara (then President of the World Bank), Edmond de Roothschild, British Prime Minister James Callahan, journalist Bill Moyers, and Henry Kissingher, sometimes described as CEO of the New World Order.  A local rumor even has it that when Henry Kissingher visited, he proclaimed:  “We will rule the world from here.”"
           </p>
           <p>
            "they see the Baca, which they call ‘The Valley of the Refuge of World Truths,’ as the paradigm for the entire planet and say that the fate of the earth is at stake.  Apparently, the Kissinghers, the Rockerfellers, the McNamaras, the Roothschilds, and other Establishment New World Order elites all agree as well, for they do their pilgrimage to the Baca- where politics and the occult- the New World Order and the New Age- all merge…..Baca Grande also appears to be a magnet for military attention…. And reputedly is an active site for observing both UFO’s and spiritual manifestations."

            Wha-ho-ho, my friend.
           </p>
           <p>
            This TSTK shit is deep deep shit.  It hits so close to home.
           </p>
           <p>
            What kind of info do you want/need? If it is directly TSTK related I prob have it. If it is indirect, I may or may not. Entertain me. Whatchu wanna know? :) For some reason, this is the one out of 10000 avenues that drew my interest 150%.
           </p>
           <p>
            If I can help at all, let me know.
           </p>
           <p>
            This info won't cause arrests or imprisonments. But if you can understand the big BIG picture, then you are way less likely to unknowingly participate in it. Once you get the big picture, everything changes. You'll never see anything the same again. This is the most liberated I have ever felt, but at the same time, the most restricted.

             Anything you want to share, I will look into - my interest in this one is 150% as well. So literally anything would be great. Even if nothing happens as a result of this - and as depressing as this sounds - I want to know that we investigated this as much as possible, and for any - future researchers of future scandals if justice does not happen this time - that we provide something useful to them, on the important topics. Ugh anyway.

            "Much of this is early material, predating her acquaintance with Schilder which commenced, according to her autobiography, in 1930.  There are three handwritten notebooks in German, the first of which is dated 1926, and papers contained in these notebooks have been removed, unfolded, and placed in folders.  Typed and handwritten correspondence and memos in both German and English, dating from 1928 through 1940"  --- I want to be able to see what these say

            Funny they mention 2 "controversies" neither of which seem to be chiefly in reference to drugging children with LSD and Electroshocking them.

            SUB-SERIES 1: THE FATHER DIVINE CONTROVERSY, 1935-1944 
SUB-SERIES 2: THE BENDER-GESTALT CONTROVERSY, 1945-196
 The controversies series consists of documents concerning two professional issues in which Bender became embroiled.
 Sub-Series 1 relates to an article Bender published in The Journal of Nervous and Mental Diseases.  Although the article is not named in any of the related correspondence which dates from 1935, the only article published by Bender in that journal near that time is "Psychiatric Mechanisms in Child Murderers," published in volume 80 of the journal in 1934, so that correspondence in the following year would seem to be on target.  The correspondence is from researchers interested in Bender's findings, and from followers of Father Divine, interested in defending him and his followers from Bender's allegations.  There are also clippings from issues of Divine's magazine, The New Day, ranging from 1940-1944.
           </p>
           <p>
            Sub-Series 2, the Bender-Gestalt Dispute, records Bender's successful fight against infringement of her copyright for the Bender Visual Motor Gestalt Test (popularly known as the Bender-Gestalt Test) which she developed and reported in 1938.  The bulk of the records fall in 1960-1962, when Bender engaged attorneys Hutt and Gerald J. Briskin, entitled, The Clinical Use of the Revised Bender Gestalt Test.  In letters on the subject dated November 9, 1960, Bender gives some of the most salient history on the matter, alluding to difficulties with Hutt that went back to 1945.  Copies of that early correspondence are included in the file.  The case was resolved on June 30, 1962, with the signing of a stipulation that the book would carry statements essentially dictated by Bender's attorneys.

             Regarding comics: Marvel comics are all about MKULTRA/Mind Control. The movies all show different aspects of Gov't r&amp;d to create super soldiers, etc. Makes me wonder if Stan Lee is trying to warn us or if he's a propaganda machine.

            Excellent information and yes, these projects and sub projects are very important to Pizzagate research as C.I.A. and others are directly involved. Don't be fooled by phony reports that MKULTRA was shut down,  it just went more underground. My theory and it is shared by some others, is that if the general public had any idea the numbers of children subjected to this type of trauma based torture that causes disassociation and thus alters, that there would be a huge  revolt against these institutions. MKULTRA is but the tip of the iceberg. 
These recent protests against Trump and the people involved makes me wonder, This just reeks of mind control and it makes my wonder how many of these 'protesters' are i n fact victims of some sort of Monarch programming or mind control.

           <blockquote>
            <p>
             After leaving Harvard in 1955, Price enlisted in the Air Force and was given an assignment in the East Bay (San Francisco Bay Area). He rented a room in San Francisco at Alan Watts’ and Frederic Spiegelberg’s newly founded American Academy of Asian Studies (the precursor to the California Institute of Integral Studies). During this time North Beach Beat scene was an emerging social trend. Dick knew most of the primary figures including (Jack Kerouac, Allen Ginsberg, etc.) and Gary Snyder. Dick married his first wife, Bonnie, in a Zen ceremony.
            </p>
            <p>
             In 1956, Price experienced an episode of manic psychosis in San Francisco which he later described as simply "a state", what he believed was a mental break that was transitory and which he needed to go through and experience rather than repress or manage. He was hospitalized, returned to Chicago, and discharged from the Air Force.
            </p>
            <p>
             On December 7, 1956, Price was involuntarily committed by his parents to the Institute of Living, an exclusive mental treatment facility in Connecticut. While hospitalized, he was misdiagnosed as a schizophrenic, then subjected to physical confinement and major tranquilizers, along with numerous electroconvulsive and insulin shock treatments. While committed, his mother had his marriage annulled He was released almost a year later on Thanksgiving Day 1957. Price never forgave his parents for their actions during this episode.
            </p>
            <p>
             n May 1960, Price returned to San Francisco and took up residence at the East-West House with Gia-Fu Feng. That year he met fellow Stanford University graduate Michael Murphy at Haridas Chaudhuri’s Cultural Integration Fellowship where Murphy was in residence. Dick moved into the Cultural Integration Fellowship as well. They conceived of the idea of a place where individuals could become open to ways of thinking while avoiding the dogma often associated with groups organized around a single idea promoted by a charismatic leader. In 1961, Murphy and Price visited the oceanside property in Big Sur, California, that was owned by Murphy's family. The property included a natural hot springs.
            </p>
            <p>
             In 1962, using the Murphy property and capital that Dick had accumulated, along with assistance from Alan Watts, Aldous Huxley, Laura Huxley, Gerald Heard, Gregory Bateson and Frederic Spiegelberg (with whom both had studied at Stanford), Price and Murphy founded the Esalen Institute. Among other objectives, Price saw Esalen as an alternative to then current mental health practice, especially the practices of mental hospitals. Esalen was to be a place where inner process could move forward safely and without interruption.

             In 1968 Tarnas entered Harvard, graduating with an A.B. cum laude in 1972. He received his Ph.D. from Saybrook Institute in 1976 with a thesis on psychedelic therapy. In 1974 Tarnas went to Esalen in California to study psychotherapy with Stanislav Grof. From 1974 to 1984 he lived and worked at Esalen Institute in Big Sur, California, teaching and studying with Grof, Joseph Campbell, Gregory Bateson, Huston Smith, Elizabeth Kübler-Ross, and James Hillman. He also served as Esalen's director of programs and education. Jeffrey Kripal characterizes Tarnas as both the literal and figurative gate-keeper of Esalen.

             The California Institute of Integral Studies (CIIS) was founded in 1968 in San Francisco, California.
            </p>
            <p>
             CIIS was characterized as a major center of the Human Potential movement. According to Gleig and Floress (2013), "one can trace a direct line from Integral Yoga through [the Cultural Integration Fellowship] to two of the major centers of the Human Potential movement and the transpersonal psychology field it birthed: Esalen and the California Institute of Integral Studies (CIIS)."
            </p>
            <p>
             CIIS's distinctive signature is the development of an integral education that combines academic scholarship with spiritual transformation and through its student body, faculty publications, and popular public program it has significantly shaped contemporary East-West spiritualities. As with the other main creative lineage centers - Esalen and CIF - CIIS is committed to a pluralistic spiritual vision and its Aurobindo roots are somewhat hidden.

               If there is any information you'd like to add - please share! The more we all talk about this information and dig through it the better... because even though a few of us do  see that picture and Esalen's involvement in this pizzagate/Mk/CIA/ NGO picture, a large proportion of even the pizzagate community might not quite understand it yet. So please share anything you think might be relevant! Unless it would be unsafe in which case please don't endanger yourself.
