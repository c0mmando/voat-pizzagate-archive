            We can expect more attacks on Trump and on the Russians as these revelations come out.  But the deep state needs to be careful, the Russian bear is mad as hell and not going to take it anymore....

            Russia are being blamed and hit from all sides at the moment, mainly because they are supporting Assad.
The west must overthrow Assad at all costs, with Russian help this can't happen, so Russia needs to be seen as pure evil so that the whole world is against Russia, this is why we have seen the so say Russia nerve agent attack in England. This is what it’s all about, I think it was probably the MI5 that used the nerve agent on the Russian spy, they want to stir the hatred for Russia to gain support for a UN attack on Assad, this is a final throw of the dice to get Russia out of Syria. At the moment Assad is winning the war with Russian help, this can’t be allowed at any cost.
           </p>
           <p>
            With all nations against them they want to soften Russia over the Syrian crisis so that Assad is finally removed from power. They are playing a very dangerous game.
