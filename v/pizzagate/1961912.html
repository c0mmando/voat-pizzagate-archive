            The trump family makes ample use of slave labor in china, Quatar just to name two.  Oh, let's not forget trump using polish workers in nyc that were treated horribly.  This is all for show and some will be thrown under the bus to appease the crowd.  It's called limited hangout...since 'they' know the information is surfacing control what comes out and diffuse the rest.

              Oh please, trump knew what was going on/spent time on sight.  Polish workers sleeping on site, no helmets (safety requirement).  Paid much less than going wage.  trump knows where his pennies go and has quite a reputation for stiffing his contractors on top of everything else.  Plus his shady dealings with Eric's cancer charity (for the children no less).  This just a dabble of his unethical business practices.

               Actually, this is how contracting works, especially in construction/chemical plants. This is nothing out of the ordinary. Also, what exactly is shady about Eric's cancer charity? You just stated a liberal talking point &amp; provided zero information as to how it is shady. I understand you are Anti-Trump, as is made clear by simply looking at your past comments, but please try to shill better &amp; hide the evidence of your past shilling.

                I am anti corruption, bold face lying, manipulation and taking people's trust and spitting in their faces.  If you really did read past comments you would see initially I gave trump and his crew every benefit of the doubt.  When he bombed Yemen, then Syria...I had to take the blinders off bc I am against killing innocent ppl.  Not enough he bombed Syria on fabricated bs, now he's threatening to do it again if one more chemical attack happens...hello Isis, time to set off another one.  If you are not working for his propaganda machine then educate yourself.
               </p>
               <p>
                If you want to know about the shenanigans of Eric's cancer deal/that started out fairly legit till dad got in the mix, then look it up for yourself.  Trump has a long history of corruption and it's not just polish workers or making money off a cancer charity.  I wanted to believe he had a change of heart.  So many of us wanted to believe.  We knew absolutely what we would get with killary and hope against hope we hoped trump would be different bc he said what we longed to hear.  You have no idea what many of us went thru that hoped and believed in the man.  Yes we were naive...but I don't fault us for that/decent ppl tend to imagine decency in others no matter how far fetched.  I knew his policies would trash the environment, but so did killary's.  I knew corporations would gain more power, but same with killary.  I knew there would be backdoor deals that benefit the top tier, but same with killary.  What I did expect was the senseless bombing of ppl for zionist expansion would stop.  Look at the stats for how many innocents have been obliterated or maimed just since he took office and no, I'm not going to provide you with links/if you want to know it's easy to find. At least he doesn't eat children is about all that can be said in his favor now.

              You are never alone.  Was a time not too long ago I bought into the charade too.  As each one of us awakens we hold the candle for the next one.  Someone held a candle for me~

               Remaining awake and spreading the word.  As long as we chase false hope and false gods nothing will change.  I very much like what Wisconsin/Racine says about working at the local level/you start from the ground and work up.  As long as we buy into the DC drama du jour we won't see what is happening right in our own area and we won't put our efforts to changing things.  That's the fear, that we will come together locally for when we do that we become powerful.  We remember how to talk to each other, work with each other, awaken each other.
              </p>
              <p>
               It's the reason states rights is being fought...bc as long as ppl look to the figureheads in DC and the theatrical productions nothing will change...nothing.  The plan is to throw some under the bus and everyone will go back to deep slumber.  Just imagine if hill and podesta are sacrificed the rejoicing, the back slapping if that happens. Not saying they will be the sacrificial lambs but they might.  It likens to the roman games of throwing ppl to the lions.
              </p>
              <p>
               The biggest threat to the established order is for each of us to awaken fully to the charade.  Our obstacle, and 'they' know this, is our natural inclination for believing others have some shred of honesty and decency...bc we have those qualities in ourselves.
              </p>
              <p>
               The other quality 'they' use against us is hope...bc we have not lost all hope so they direct it towards ppl that say hopeful things.
              </p>
              <p>
               And then there is faith bc 'they' know we have faith in a greater good and in justice so they fabricate characters that mimic those traits.
              </p>
              <p>
               When we see the theater for what it is, when we see the characters for who they are, then we can begin to formulate how to proceed.  We each take responsibility for our own lives and what is happening around us.  We encourage others to awaken.  We form groups of awareness.  We protect each other and the innocents in our area, then we expand.  Elected officials go to DC and don't give a shit what we want.  If we unite locally we hold them responsible to us.  Then we expand to the state level.  We take back our power which we can do but it will never happen as long as we are watching the charade.
              </p>
              <p>
               As an example in this area Save the Ozarks took on the powerful electric company and won.  It looked like an impossible task but they never gave up.  From the beginning it looked like a slam dunk for the elec company...they had all the right ppl in their pockets and all the big money behind them...but ppl never gave up.  This is how grassroots works and it is our hope and what we can put our faith in...bc grassroots is us!

             They are the ones doing the traficking. You should check out the Voat Pizzagate sub forum foir info on this. I am sure they will start slapping cuffs on each other any day now.

             Why would that matter?...they would be treated like kings.

            <p>
             First there would have to be arrests which wont be reported in the MSM then the case would be tied up for 5 years then a trial and then if convicted wont be reported by the MSM then they would be sent to "resort prisons" where they would live the high life like Jeffrey Epstein where he was treated like royalty and would get a young prostitute to visit him whenever he wanted...

              He(Epstein) served 13 months of an 18-month sentence in a Palm Beach county jail instead of state prison—16 hours of which, on every day but Sunday, he could spend at his home or in his office, due to a work release provision in the deal.

A seemingly insane, orange skinned man who offended nearly everyone, turns out to be the record setting troll of the universe, all in an attempt to covertly save the world.

             USA is the worsk traficker. I am sure Tillerson will be calling for the arrest for chinese officials and cops, while the CIA and our establishment laugh, trafic, rape , torture, murder, organ harvest children.

             So, I remember when you used to post a few things of value back in the day... did you become this jaded over time? Or upset that people didn't buy into your anti-Semitic views? Or are you shilling for Soros to cover your Starbucks expenses and mustache wax?

              Trump is a NY billionaire, complict in the 9/11 coverup, a zionist, an elite, does not call out terroist as US armed and funded assets, instead he plays along with the false flags, has made zero arrest of the cabal, has not investigated Hillary, has not brought jobs back to America, is a walking Limited hangout to convince truthers they are winning. They are playing chess and you are playing candlyland.

               I respect your theory and the facts you use to back it up. He is on video right after 9/11 saying there is no way the planes brought them down.

              <p>
               I am of the mind that the inner circle cabal has attempted to bring him in but he has not been compromised and therefore has some leverage on them.  With that said, I agree with where you are coming from, but I am going to continue to wait and see.
