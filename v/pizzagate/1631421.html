I registered today because after much research into pizzagate and as of late, specifically James Alefantis; I am very concerned about his Goddaughter Caris . Though I have zero evidence, aside from circumstantial,  (like most everyone else here). it is my strong suspicion that James has taken ownership of her with the blessing of her parents. They may have done this for monetary reasons or personal ones or both. I believe it is very possible that he has been grooming her since an infant. (The innuendos by his parents on his Instagram and his linking his own name to hers to me implies ownership.) it may he was perhaps even in relationship, maybe even a love triangle with the parents.. I do not know if many of you know but Caris father is the &quot;chicken&quot; lover guy in James Alefantis instagram. He and his wife used to sketchy day care center in Portland, Oregon  before the mother (allegedly, we dont\' even know that for sure.) came to work at Comet Ping Pong.  The father also makes furniture, one of the pieces he makes certainly looks a lot like the boy lover symbol. He is also a fan of Butt mag&gt; A hardcore gay online mag &amp; hook-up site. All this can be evidenced in JA\'s instagram. Also, his comment towards Caris mother. #MIWTF: &quot;Mother I want to fuck. There is something very wrong with this family.. My sole purpose here this evening is in the lucky chance that JA is reading this. (I know he followed voat before) .That he please surrender her . Mr. Alefantis, no one has to know that you took possession of her. I am a CSA victim myself (SRA) and am a hot mess. I do not want this little girl to suffer the same fate. No pictures of her have appeared on social media since 2015. This is strange. I do not believe Mr. Alefantis would ever surrender her to a stranger because I feel he is very close to her. If I am wrong. I sincerely apologize. I know I can be sued for defamation but saving this little girls mind and life would be worth it. Aside from all this, I 100% believe pizzagate is real. I was personally a victim of SRA at the hands of a powerful Secret Society in Hollywood, Ca.</p>

            They ran a daycare?  Yea she is in grave danger all right.  I've infiltrated these kinda groups before.  Some actually try to make deals to abuse each other's children SRSLY.

             Exactly. I think that JA owns Caris that that was part of the agreement at birth. Hence when the mom says on his Instagram #andsoitbegan. It is hard for people to wrap their minds around this. And many try to think that he is the biological father. No, this is an arrangement. Please investigate this and tell me what your thoughts are. Last known public photo of her was from 2015.  She would now be about 7. JA is photographed with her literally at birth and he seems to have an obsession with this child. the parents don't appear to run a day center any more. But the father has his furniture business and mother is mostly MIA. I actually contacted him and said he should provide current pics of his child to quell some rumors. Needless to say, he did not respond. (the mother used to work at CPP. at one time.)

            i met an old white man once who we called chicken fucker... he literally had a tattoo of a dude fucking a chicken on his ass, very strange since this guy was homeless, and yet the tattoo was almost perfect, was it some kind of group he is a part of? i always thought so but probably won't ever find out the truth. he was a convicted sex offender

            Appears the mods are more interested in Nazi style journalism rules than possibly saving the life or lives of children in danger. That or have been compromised. Perhaps this forum is not for me. There are other threads that are contain far less sources and they are still up. I have been deleted 3 times since last night. Could it be content I am discussing? None of us has any concrete evidence of anything and all is speculation at this point when it comes to pizzagate. In any case. I believe that if this child is indeed safe, parents or someone should step up and show is she is ok. Post a recent pic or something. The silence is deafening. And the speculation will only get worse since, as one posted suggested, Caris has become the face of pizzagate.
           </p>
           <p>
            As for my specific case, i cannot divulge Secret Society since they are still active and it would be dangerous. It is even possible, due to some of Podesta's leaked emails via wikileaks, that they may even be involved in Pizzagate. Though this is not verifiable at this point of course. The Secret Society in my case is one of the most powerful in the world.
           </p>
           <p>
            I was a victim at 10 years old. Powerful and famous person, so this made it all the more difficult. Mind controlled to never reveal even to myself. (those that have DID will know what I mean).  Mine was a sex magick ritual. I do not want to go into details at this point. I don't fully trust this site thus far. Mods have so far shown terrible bias. But suffice to say, it was horrific and gory. Animal sacrifice was involved among other things. I think I should start another thread on this but mods may ask for my first born. Or my birth certificate so not sure.
           </p>
           <p>
            I am seldom if ever wrong on gut feeling due to my past experiences. It is my belief that James Alefantis and the Podestas are definitely involved in some nefarious activities. I have even started to speculate that JA may be CIA operative. I do suspect he has associations with Secret Societies. His giving donations to the Theosophical Waldorf schools is very telling. Steiner, it's founder was also head of an OTO chapter back in early part of Century.

           <p>
            Is JA CIA?? Thought this was fanciful but after his threat to the pizzagategear guy and the mind fuck he gave him, i am starting to wonder.

            Oh wow - I had never seen the BUTT mag stuff. And now that butt comment on the "baby on hammock" instagram pic makes more sense. Disgusting. I could not get the etsy listing to load - any chance you could archive it or screengrab that page?

            The address for Portland Natural Casket Co, which I think is his business, is a house in Lake Oswego Oregon. Looks more like a home than a business.

            Could you write about your own terrible experiences? No need for name dropping. Would maybe work better as a separate post. It's very pizzagate relevant if it includes influenced people.

            For what it's worth I have asked James voat personality to please just show us a sign she is okay, in a replay of a conversation we were having on here, to which there was no response. I do like to focus on her because she is a face to the madness, but this post isn't going to convince James or anyone to help, we're going to have to solve this mystery on our own.

            I agree that it would be good if survivors provided some information, nothing identifying, but just perhaps insight into the kinds of ways these people operate etc. I just think that we do want victims to feel comfortable coming forward and so it is always worth being welcoming and taking seriously anyone who identifies themselves as a survivor, it is better to err on the side of kindness and also it will offer encouragement to others who might be reading and unsure about coming forward.

            Thank God you are safe now. You say you're a hot mess after being a victim yourself. I hope you're getting the love and support you need. You're brave to come and try to help these kids. I hope Caris is ok too 🙁

              It was discussed here on Voat and the actual owner information was posted and discussed. His association with the bar is he made their sign. Sign making is something he does. Bottom line is, he's obviously part of this but that bar has proven to be unconnected already.

            I know this is concerning. Most of us here would like to know that Caris and her sister are ok. But it truly is just an accusation. What more can we do to find out if she is ok? Any ideas?

            l4l1lul3l0 raises some good points, and if I can suggest anything, it would be to go through old posts on the Portland angle, and summarize previous research, including any proposed next steps on the this aspect. I know I would appreciate a summary of what has been found previously and what further could be done.

            I think it should be easy to ask about Ceris since Alfantis even mentions her in Megyn Kelly interview.  Not an unusual question.  Eg. To Law Enforcement:  I am concerned about that little girl Alfantis mentioned on her show, can you find out if she is alright?

            For them to sue you for defamation, they would have to show damages and that your claims are not true which opens themselves up to scrutiny. They are probably more afraid of you suing them which you absolutely should if the statute of limitations in your state allows. Try to find a good lawyer willing to sacrifice their career or if indictments really do come down on others in your area and you feel safe to, call your local fbi/police sex crime unit and report them.  you sound brave and kind, stay well.

            Those dark bags under her eyes have always bothered me (along with a lot of the other kids from JAs Insta feed).  An update on her would be great.

             The dark circles are abnormal. I've been looking at kids eyes for similar dark circles/bags and it's not common at all, yet many of the kids associated with Alefantis and his circle have them.

            I can't imagine what you've been through, I hope knowing that more people are aware now and are actively working to try to expose this and bring the perpetrators to justice gives you some comfort.

            People have mentioned before that Caris hasn't been seen in photos for a while, which is worrying given the circumstances. I don't know if there are any official ways you can check on a child, like perhaps ask for a welfare check for her in the place her parents live? I don't know if that's possible or how you could be sure you weren't asking for help from someone who is part of it all.

            I agree - I think posts from survivors should always stay, these are the people we are here for and the people who can help us with their perspective and experience and we should support them, they are also important first hand testimony to what goes on, and there is no more compelling evidence than that.

             You've mixed up two people and two bits of information. Caris' father, Scott Cummings used to make caskets (the company appears to have ceased trading now) so he would have made caskets for children as well as adults, and he also made them for pets I read on one of his sites, and also urns. The coffee table in the shape of a coffin was made by Jeff Smith, aka "werkinonmahnightcheese" - instagram name.

            why don't you ask James Alefantis?. He's apparently a member of this BBS. He's on this thread.. So you can reply to his question about Sessions and Hillary with your own question?  -

            There isn't anything in the first link of the imgur album but check out my comment on this post...no one responded to it back then and it is really important and creepy that SCummings makes these .
