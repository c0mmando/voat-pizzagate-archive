            It really is.  I was waiting for my sandwich at a little local lunch place yesterday so I flipped through the local food and music magazine and ran across some local band call sweet crude with a new album released titled Creatures.  Pedo and all seeing eye one worldorder symbols all over the album cover with the moon and star thing like Comet ping pong

              You would really enjoy The Memoirs of Billy Shears. Sir Paul comes clean on a lot of this stuff they were involved in. Calls it the occult but shies away from "Satanism." He calls what he does "Paulism," channeling the dead Paul. He's a high ranking mason and admires Crowley. I believe the book to be the real deal. Spooky too.

            So whats the narrative here at VOAT these days? 
Is it shills posing as anti-jew \ anti- ZIONISM, all the while themselves being apart of the very group they speak of?
Controlling the narrative by infiltration? sounds about right!

             Bingo..   they all seem to descend on the same threads and all write in very similar fashion. These are the shills and it may seem a bit harsh, but I call them out immediately.  I never respond to their questions, I call them cunts. Why would anyone attack a thread like this?
            </p>
            <p>
             Look how innocuous this submission seems to be, yet it shows the tight relationship between elite, known Jewish families that have the MSM soapbox, and attributes of suspects of the PG investigation.  This trip by this family is so blatantly creepy and scripted AND found on the front page of the NYTimes, at this particular time in the investigation.  IT IS NO COINCIDENCE.

               A spiral can be just a spiral, sure, but not when its in association with a family who openly believes in the Talmud and Kabalah, two things which completely tie into pedophila. The Talmud explicitly states that Rabbis can have sex with goyim children as long as they are at least three years old. TALMUD = PEDOPHILIA = PEDO SYMBOLOGY.

               It's not difficult. People are just getting rattled by your comments because you're a shill who's good at his job. You're one of those "OMG GUYS NOT EVERY TRIANGLE AND SWIRL IS A PEDO SYMBOL" guys. Problem is, every single time we discover a pedo symbol somewhere, you people swarm the thread, squawking like birds "NOT EVERY TRIANGLE, NOT EVERY SWIRL." Every fucking time. So, according to you and your ilk, NO symbols found ANYWHERE are EVER pedo symbols, no matter how closely they resemble the declassified FBI symbols. That's how I know you're a shill.

                Because every single time a spiral gets posted its stupid. You guys are trying to shut down a drug cartel by focusing on street dealers who may or may not have ties to that cartel. Youre all idiots and its comical.what you ignorant faggots post. Ive been at voat for longer than your sub has even existed. The only shills here are 50℅ of your active users posting these distractions. Calling you fags Scooby Doo was an insult to cartoon dogs.

                 I know it's a scary thought, son, knowing that pedophiles run the establishment and they're everywhere, at all levels of government, businesses, police, etc. I know it's scary, but pretending it's not real isn't going to help anything.

                 Also, this whole "you guys are only going after the small fish" thing makes no sense. How else can we ever get a big fish to show itself if we don't throw some fucking dynamite into the pond and scare them away from their hiding places?

                  You arent doing any of that. You point to small and many times totally bullshit things. Chasing shadows and ghosts while your actual target laughs.

                    Ive never claimed to be doing any. It isnt a requirement for anything. I am here to give you advice that all of you are too stubborn and short-sighted to hear. Continue chasing shadows if you want this to go nowhere. And continue calling any critic a shill, thats productive.

                      I can clearly see you will never accomplish anything of value. You are unable to listen to any outside voice. Have fun chasing ghosts like the retards you are.

                      And not every triangle is pedo related. Some of what I see posted isnt even close. Ive seen Interscope records logo posted. There was one yesterday about some co Soulcue, it was a triangle and other than that it wasnt a spiral. And that shit is daily. And lastly, the triangle is one of the three basic 2D shapes, it is going to be everywhere. And similar is the spiral, a glyph as old as man, it is everywhere. You waste your time w this shit.

                      But, dont listen, you wont. Im done talking to you because youve closed your mind.

                         I haven't given you a single downvoat. I don't try to silence people with different opinions, but I don't have to just blindly agree that you're right. Maybe sometimes you are right, I'm sure that not ALL swirls and triangular symbols are secret society-related, but your argument that NONE of them are is just as stupid as anything that's been posted here.

                The only retard here is you chasing shadows which will lead nowhere. Because you are an idiot that cant find his way to real evidence. This sub does more damage to its own investigation than the Jews ever could. You are all idiots. I enjoy laughing at your ineffectual threads though.

                      Ah, I didnt realize a minority opinion automatically made me incorrect. I guess I need to get in lockstep w your retarded ideas. You do realize that the majority are often wrong?  Very often wrong. That is one weak ass argument Jewbag.

               Neither does having a certificate that says you passed your "Child Trafficking investigating" exam.  Because these are people fake/false investigators.  Its more like a "guarding the hen-house" exam.

                I agree with you, but that's a non sequitur.

                Your point was that people who sit around Googling are bona fide INVESTIGATORS.  That is not true, and you know it.

               Then name some "REAL" ones.  Because the FBI/CIA get paid not to be investigators.  If people on here had access to all the tools they have the pizzagate network would be fully exposed and would be shut down within less than a week.

If i say john kerry is a crypto, some who dont know thats confirmed fact may roll their eyes, so if he says the pope is a crypto, ill at least considerate it, if he says all popes ever have been cryptos, i wont dismiss that outright either becuae ITS NOT SLOWING DOWN THE INVESTIGATION LIKE THESE 90 MINUTE INTERVIEWS NECESSARILY DO

                    So now YOU'RE implying Jews are so distinct that it is impossible for one to work against the rest.  Whereas he openly admits his familiarity with jewish evil. I too have some jewish blood.

                   <p>
                    The uniqueness of the WESTERN MAN is his individualism and belief that individuals have conscience.  So again by your own standards YOU wpuld be the jewbaiter shill. I like what all 3 of yall write about jews frankly so dont shoot inside the tent.

                      The United States is a JEWISH colony.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                      The U.S. Jewish population is second only to ISis-amenRA-ELohim.  Germany formerly held the distinction of having the largest population of Jews.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                      Ergo, there are TONS of overt and COVERT JEWS in the U.S., many of whom are HERE. Many covert Jews DO NOT EVEN KNOW their genealogy well enough to know they are from crypto families yet may have seen artifacts, etc. (e.g., hidden menorah in grandma's closet, separate bowls for meat and dairy, etc.) and also have an AFFINITY for Jews, ESPECIALLY if they were brainwashed with "Judaeo-Christian" religious crap.

               The point is that you do not have many submission points and have not submitted many posts of your own. You just comment on everyone else's and tell them how good of a researcher YOU are. You say you get "original material" from researching. You say everyone else sucks except you and one other user which is your alt. So, it's in the numbers. You hardly contribute anything except shilling. Where are those great investigative skills you always speak of?

                  A womans only job is to raise healthy children and respect her husbands wishes.  In her free time she should cultivate herself to be engaging and attractive and improve her community.  This is what islam prescribes, which is why jewish bullshit social movements like feminism cant take hold there: democracy, rule of man, cannot supercede the rule of GOD

                       lol you're crazy. What do you mean Jews don't rape children. The article from the link you posted says they are pedophiles. You can't lump all people from a certain race, ,culture or religion into all being the same way. God forbid if all men thought like you.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                       So you don't seem to like American women. We're all whores right? Women should bow to her husband and you'd like 4 wives? Lol. Where do you plan on living like this? Utah? Are you becoming Morman? 🤔 Where are you going to find your wives? Lol

                        Women don't get sarcasm either, probably the first form of humor invented.  You're 100,000 years behind in terms of comedy.  Chew on that, then my FAT UNCIRCUMCIZED COCK.

                        Obviously I will PAY A DOWRY as our ancestors once did.  You trust modern women to pick their spouses and you get a fucking gym faggot with tattoos and an anklet whose job will be automated TOMORROW.

                        Edit: the faggot's job, not his anklet's; I don't want to confuse you further.

              equineluvr and others on here reminds me of the movie "The Thing" where the parasite imitates the host to spread its virus everywhere else like those pretending to be from  "4chan" and trying to imitate the lingo used on that forum.  Its really embarrassing I wish the Jews would just stop it.

                  "LMAO they are just EVIL JEWS" is a hell of a non answer. Hell, evolution is easier to swallow than something that stupid. They themselves are not "other-worldly," but they are in the hands of something "other-worldly" and it ain't shape-shifting reptilians.

                   Mostly a combination of personality traits -- aggression and deception (which they call being "clever").  Combined with the gullibility of the "goyim."  All taking place within THEIR network.  Jews not only HIDE under surnames and religions, they also defend each other and work together for the "common good" (think communism).  Over time, they have been able to "convince" many greedy "goyim" to assist them.

                   RELIGION is a MAJOR brainwashing tool utilized by the Jews.  Unfortunately, you have already revealed that you subscribe to those religious beliefs so a conversation with you on this topic isn't likely to get far.

                    And the answer to the problem is ??  Yes it was the elders that pulled off the Reformation LOL. Who's brainwashed? That would be a mighty feat, you should learn more about it. No, you have no real answer cause you are an infidel. Now hold on, I absolutely agree that religious brainwashing is used ala John Hagee and many others to support Zionism.

                     Several years ago I used to watch John Hagee. No wonder I didn't get the whole Jew thing until recently. I don't think all Jews are bad tho. There's government and there are people. Not all the people are bad. That's like saying another country that hates the U.S thinks we're all evil because of OUR war hungry lying government. Everybody cannot be lumped into the same category.

                      My point is that Equine attributes superhuman monolithic power to the Zionist Jews yet denies it in the same breath. And, other point being that the explanation for them being "cursed" as a race lies in the fact that they rejected their messiah, and have been miserably paying a horrible price ever since, Yet (unlike donkey and equine and others) they are not w/out hope, in that God will gather them in again, as a people and a race. This is plainly taught in the NTestament. Hagee just takes it too far, to the point that he says they are saved, simply because they are Jews (God's chosen) when in fact at this point in history they reject and actually hate and despise Christ their own messiah. "Judgement has come upon them to the uttermost." It's a complicated topic. But all the great men of The Great Reformation imbibed everything I've just said, some of the greatest men of God that ever walked this earth, since the time of the apostles. They were heroes in that they almost destroyed the Great Whore Church of Babylon, Roman Catholicism. Equine thinks the Elders of the Jews (in the protocols) engineered the Great Reformation, that's idiocy, that they outwitted Almighty God's near destruction of the Roman Church.

               It is embarrassing, and blatantly obvious.  They pretend to be all knowing and more concerned than others, constantly protecting the 'sactity' of the investigation and guiding it along a rail they laid down months ago, but when you search their submissions to the sub,  (((bumpkis))).   Btw

               , you are definitely an 'investigator'.  I wonder if this submission from miou clears the bar for my investigator badge &gt;

                Being wrong is one thing, being wrong after claiming something was "obvious" is (i imagine) SO EMBARRASSING that i dont want you to suffer it.
