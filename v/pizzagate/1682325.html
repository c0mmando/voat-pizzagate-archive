<p>So Here is a pic of this guy with Luis and Jennifer Argueta (reference sub to see connections to Podesta (I also need to start a new sub on the ARGUETA FAMILY of criminals)</p>
<p>PIC- Jon, Luis, Jennifer in Stamford. <a href="https://www.facebook.com/LuisArguetaDirector/photos/rpp.218066865060937/360403114160644/?type=3&amp;theater">https://www.facebook.com/LuisArguetaDirector/photos/rpp.218066865060937/360403114160644/?type=3&amp;theater</a></p>
<p>I am positive we have a dirty pedo cop here.</p>
<p>The thing that is interesting about this is he works with a.. AUGUSTO PODESTA and they work with Sourth American children/art/child services. That is a sidlinen I am digging into and will ad once I verify. many community / child based projects in Stamford.</p>
<p>**sideline- Another Podesta relation ---I think Augusto is another Podesta &quot;adopted&quot; child. more on that in the new thread but this stuff is coming quick and I want to capture until I can compile. I am doing it here for now.</p>
<p>The Police Chief appears to have murdered his predeccessor (that is my deduction, it is possible this guy really committed suicide but I doubt it)</p>
<p>Article:. Former Stamford police chief found dead in apparent suicide Louis DeCarlo lead the department from 2001 to 2004</p>
<p><a href="http://www.stamfordadvocate.com/news/article/Former-Stamford-police-chief-found-dead-in-5549076.php">http://www.stamfordadvocate.com/news/article/Former-Stamford-police-chief-found-dead-in-5549076.php</a></p>
<p>and Jon \'personally\' handled this case himself. How convenient. Here is the quote: &quot;There\'s nothing I can fathom why this happened or why it would happen to anyone,&quot; said Police Chief Jon Fontneau who was personally handling the investigation. &quot;It\'s very sad and we just have to watch out for his family at this time.&quot; Fontneau served under DeCarlo in the department\'s Youth Bureau and reported directly to him as commander of the midnight division</p>
<p>So Fontneau served under this guy in the Youth Bureau in the \'midnight division\' and then this guy suddenly comes up with a suicide that Fontneu so generously claimed he would PERSONALLY handle. Clearly this guy knew too much. I also believe that the above quote is a warning to the family of DeCarlo. its \'sad\' \'we just have to watch out for his family at this time&quot; what does that even mean? I see veiled threat but perhaps its a stretch. I just know this guy killed him.</p>
<p>Fontneau was with Division of Family Services\' Youth Bureau before becoming uniform commander for the midnight shift. Finally, he joined the Narcotics &amp; Organized Crime division Meet Jon Fontneau</p>
<p><em>Here is an article when he was first announced. He said he would like the department to become more involved with after-school and truancy programs that would enable police officers to work more with youngsters. &quot;I really feel we have to invest in our kids. And that is what we have done for years here, and I think that is one of the reasons why our crime rate is so low,&quot; Fontneau said. He really wants to expand \'family based policing&quot; whatever the fuck that is.</em></p>

            - check out p.8 
"We have constructive relationships with the Stamford Police
Department and the City of Stamford, as well as local immigration
attorneys and other community leaders. These associations benefit
our community at many levels. We work collaboratively with senior
officials from the city, addressing issues that affect the community
we serve. Police officers attend our programs, from community
presentations to Family Nights. They often stop in to chat for a few
minutes while on patrol in the neighborhood. These visits are very
effective in developing the community’s perceptions of police officers
and other city officials, and enhancing their willingness to interact
with each other." oh really... I think that the second guy in is one of the cops who texted the 16 year old and kept his job.

            PLEASE NOTE THAT THIS ORGANIZATION IS NATIONWIDE. WITH GLOBAL CONTACTS. This is full of leads. I have only just posted based upon the 3 dickheads above. I am sure there is more. This is an organization to watch. It could stand on its own for a sub.

              The bot won't respond.  :)   Someone here kindly wrote an algorithm to search for related threads.  Those are the results you see above.  Very helpful, isn't it?
