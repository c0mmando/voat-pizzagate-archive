            That's good that your girlfriend is starting to realize things. I think it's easy to be naive about pedophiles if you've never experienced something done to you. I've always had a good gut feeling when it comes to perverts. What makes me sick was that the age I was when I seen the most men look at me wrong or do something to me was age 11 to 13. Puberty. I think that is the most common age. When my daughter was 3, I would visit this sweet old lady across the street. Her son lived with her. He would be so sweet to my daughter and give her snacks and stuff so she liked him. That was always within my eyesite. But then, he said he was gonna take her to his room to watch a Disney movie. I was polite and said that I needed to get going. That was the last time we went there. I looked him up and he was a registered sex offender! Hell no!
           </p>
           <p>
            So about church, I used to work with the babies at church until about a year ago. At this church, it's very good. Really strict rules. Rather it's right or not, no men were allowed to change diapers. Plus, there had to always be at least 2 people in there. So, if you serve and have to run to the bathroom, you needed to call someone to take your place for a few minutes. But, the church I used to go to let men change diapers. They were a lot less cautious and loose on rules. Sorry if some snowflake gets upset, but I wouldn't want any guy changing my kids diaper except my husband.
           </p>
           <p>
            My daughter had a friend in 6th grade. This girl wore thongs and bras from Victoria secrets, high heel boots and makeup. My daughter would show me YouTube videos or snap chat videos of the girl and I couldn't believe it. I would let her have sleep overs at my house, but I didn't let my daughter go there. Her mom let her stay the night with tons of friends. It just tripped me out. They are still friends and she's rich. The things her parents let her have would amaze you. Before someone asks why I let my daughter be friends with her is because they would be at school anyways. I would rather have a close relationship where they can be real with me and I can monitor them at my house. Don't worry. My daughter did not turn out like that.
           </p>
           <p>
            But, sadly I learned long ago when I had my dads best friend and my brother in law start touching me and an uncle who would say and do gross things like, look at me and put his hands up with his tongue thru the middle and flick his tongue. He would do that when nobody was looking. So, if my own family could do that, then you can't trust anybody. So keep being overprotective!

            What sucks is if your kids go to public school, then they are seeing it. Especially if they have access to internet because they follow what the other kids do. It amazes me how fast a lot of parents let their kids do so young. Many don't seem cautious at all. And. Let their kids just have sleep overs at other people's houses without even meeting their parents. I guess I'm over protective but I'd rather be that than having wild molested messed up for life kids.

            No, she is obsessed with pizza too. Have you seen her latest music video? If not, I will find it for you. I couldn't believe it! It's definitely mocking Pizzagate. There is Ping Pong, she's wearing a pizza bathing suit, has PeeWee Herman on there who was a convicted perv. She dresses like a little girl in it a lot and the song keeps saying "It's no big deal" as if she's grooming people to be more accepting. Let me know if you've seen it. I definitely think something is up with that tho. But, yeah I agree she's a whore, but many of them are.

            I'm no expert, but it looks like there are subliminals in his videos. The pixels don't look right. Satanists love subliminals. I wouldn't trust anything he says. Just because he wrote a book doesn't make him legit. Just my opinion.

            He has an interesting article on Johnny Gosh and how his mother has sold him to the satanists and she was covering up the trail. I also saw the video exposing his father and how police won't go near it!

              He explains in his book that because of his traumatic birth and home life, he grew up believing that he was either "the antichrist or an antichrist". He also says in the book that although he grew up "feeling abandoned by God, I never lost faith in God's existence". I haven't seen the video where he talks about being the antichrist yet.

               Ok now I get why he's being dark and talking like that. He's not talking to the people, his followers, but to "The Order". This is so sad.

               Wow. I'll try to find that video but he was dark in that one. What you said makes it sound like he's aware that he believes he's the antichrist because of his trauma. So is he aware that it may not be true and just the trauma? In the dark video, he says "you guys chose me!" Or something like that. I'll go find it.

                I can't say that I believe or agree with everything he says on his website or on FB/Twitter. But with that video I think he may be trying to send a message to the "elites" (the ones behind the satanic ritual abuse that he suffered &amp; all of the pedogates) that he is a monster of their own making &amp; he will use their "training", if you will, against them. He's written similar stuff online.

            That music video with Father John Misty is really fucking weird, that is the singer from Fleet Foxes (Joshua Tillman) he has collaborated with Lady Gaga and Beyoncé. But the most fucked up part is his connection to Wayne Coyne from the Flaming Lips, who's got pizza dust all over himself and his Instagram.
This shit is getting more fucked up every day!
