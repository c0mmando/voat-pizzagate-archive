            Hillary knows arrests are going to be made soon high-level arrests. She is terrified of what will happen. She's trying to ridicule the whole idea of there being a pedophile network in D.C. and New York and in many other cities. The next month will determine if Trump is a savior or just another shithead who will be impeached.
           </p>
           <p>
            At this point I think Trump is going to fail he will be gone by September impeached or forced to resign in disgrace. He's doing a shitty job it's sad but he only has himself to blame. The swamp won't ever be drained we had a great chance to hit the ground running but Trump has crashed into the dirt. Sad!

             Shouldn't they know that though? Again, that seems way too overt. God, I almost hope she's being that obvious.
