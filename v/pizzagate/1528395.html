            Come on dude, they are cooks and they're actually talking about food here. What do you mean, why is it such a big deal that it needs to be communicated over email? Maybe the fact that people communicate about all kinds of trivial shit over email? Maybe the fact that they are coordinating a menu plan and meeting in person for that wouldn't be fucking effective?

             Why so many comments and discussion then? If it's nothing, it's nothing, but you never know until people look at it and think maybe make some connections. I don't know why you keep using the f word, this forum is about investigating every angle

              Because it's so obviously just a normal conversation in this case. If we start saying "code words!" about every email, we lose credibility. There is no context in this email that suggests even the remotest possibility of a connection to this investigation. The reason the pizza emails were recognized as code is because they were talking about pizza
              <em>
               in a context that didn't make any fucking sense EXCEPT as code.
              </em>
             </p>
             <p>
              The reason there is so much discussion on here is because there are a lot of well-meaning people who don't have a lot of discernment but who DO like upvoats and to feel like they contributed.
             </p>
             <p>
              Don't get bent out of shape about the f word. We are all adults here.

            Have we considered that maybe the code words aren't static, and instead change depending on the context of the situation? Perhaps the code words have a general meaning but can but can be  used differently depending on the situation. This allows them to continue doing it without anyone ever being able to pin a single meaning to one code. For instance, maybe if we looked into events going on in the background around the time this email was sent, and do that for every email including Asparagus, we can narrow down how they're using it based on repeating patterns in their behavior outside of email.
           </p>
           <p>
            I'm just speculating, but something that supports that idea is how quickly we found the handkerchief code and applied it to the emails. It just seams too easy, especially if other sub cultures use the same code for their own legal sex. Why would they abide by that code if it's well known, or easily verifiable?  Maybe because although they use the same code word, the meaning of that word changes based on the receivers knowledge of events going on in the background.
           </p>
           <p>
            If a foreign diplomat wanted a play date with podesta and some kids to fuck together, but that diplomat really dislikes pizza as a food, would it be a good idea to use the static code word of Pizza for someone who hates that type of food?

            Ok. Really need courage to say this. When you know someone that is a pedophile, as described in this article, and you give the fbi enough evidence to prove you aren't joking, they treat you like you just made the world's biggest mistake. Not like you need help. Seems it takes a whole army to bring down just one person. It should not be this way.

            I think this one might be nothing.  The menu she proposed is actually pretty reasonable.  Literally the only thing in the email suspicious at all is asparagus.  That said, given the circumstances, it is worth looking into, even if we come up with nothing.  The caterer was not named in the email, however, so it may not be easy to find them.

             I find it odd that a caterer would be bringing up items that they need, talking about how many burners they are bringing, etc. Seems like trivial details. Isn't the point of getting something catered to not worry about the meal? "the caterer is happy to bring in the other items you will need" Just sounds so pointless to write in an email, what other items could they possibly need to discuss? It's an odd discussion, and doesn't sound like catered events I've been a part of. A smaller detail is the very descriptive words to describe the food, like fresh. Wouldn't you expect food to be fresh?

             Idk, maybe I'm over reading this. Also assange didn't release all of podestas emails, why did he release the ones he did?

              Not at all.  A caterer who is cooking in-house needs to establish these details.  What if the host has facilities adn some of these aren't needed?  What if the space proposed can't accommodate what she's bringing, or needs to be rearranged to have room, or the right electrical services available.
             </p>
             <p>
              Fresh is not always assumed, but it's an indicator of quality.  It could also be frozen or dried or pre-cooked, packaged, depending what you're talking about.
             </p>
             <p>
              This is exactly the stuff you expect a gourmand like Podesta to communicate in emails.  "Pizza", not so much.

             In the archived Tampa bay article related to pizzagate asparagus was mentioned as a code word for little boys, so I searched it in the Podesta emails. Sure enough it was mentioned 15 times in relatively strange emails.
            </p>

             No potential lead should be ignored!

             If anyone can link to the article I am referring to that would be very helpful, otherwise I will keep looking for it.
