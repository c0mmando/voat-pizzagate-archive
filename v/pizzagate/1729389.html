            An Alt-F search revealed only TWO Boystown references, and they are both about ADULTS:
           </p>
           <p>
            Like "Fight Club", the first rule of the "Down Low Club" is to never talk about the "Down Low Club". If you do, you will be murdered. That's not a joke. There were a string of murders from 2005-2007 that involved men who were killed because they had knowledge of Jeremiah Wright's Down Low Club and the closeted gay black men who partook in the club's orchestrated cover-up of their homosexuality.
           </p>
           <p>
            In Corsi's article, he talks about three of the murders (including Donald Young, whom you may have heard of).
            <strong>
             <strong>
              I also believe a string of bizarre assassination-style killings in Boystown around that same time are also linked to the Down Low Club...but these were white men on the north side of Chicago who were murdered in their apartments
             </strong>
            </strong>
            by someone the police here never would admit was a serial killer.
           </p>
           <p>
            I moved to Chicago in the spring of 2005 and back then
            <strong>
             <strong>
              the strip of gay clubs called Halsted was plastered with flyers warning guys to be careful with whom they were bringing home since
              <strong>
               a murderer was loose killing guys who frequented the bars
              </strong>
              in Boystown;
             </strong>
            </strong>
            for those who can remember back to the 90s, this is the same area where Jeffrey Dahmer picked up some of his victims. Chicago was also where John Wayne Gacy (a delegate for Jimmy Carter!) also hunted.
