Balmoral Castle (/bælˈmɒrəl/) is a large estate house in Royal Deeside, Aberdeenshire, Scotland, near the village of Crathie, 6.2 miles (10 km) west of Ballater and 6.8 miles (11 km) east of Braemar.

            Joshua Wright's church has a lot of tentacles:  (scroll down)

           </p>
           <p>
            "By 1992, Pastor Joshua Wright became Bishop Joshua Wright. Several Assemblies of Jesus Christ churches were birthed, namely:
            <strong>
             Monroe, NC; Pageland, Jefferson, and Kershaw, SC; South Dakota, and Baltimore, MD
            </strong>
            .
           </p>
           <p>
            Moreover, under the leadership of this remarkable man of God, various soul-winning ministries began. In the year 2000, the congregation grew to 250 members. The following year Bishop Wright ventured into radio ministry where he and his wife hosted a program called “Straight to the heart Ministries,” which later developed “Ministers Moment” and “My Sister My Friend.” As a result of these radio broadcasts many lives have been touched and changed from Baltimore, MD to Pageland, SC.
           </p>
           <p>
            <strong>
             He has also developed relations in Canada and Central America through missionary work.
            </strong>
           </p>
           <p>
            Presently, the most prosperous ministries of OHAJC are the
            <strong>
             Winter Rescue, Children Having Overcoming Power (CHOP), Having Overcoming Power Eternally (HOPE), Saved Women in Ministry (SWIM), Daughters of Holiness, Positive Youth of Christ (PYOC) and Assembly of Jesus Christ Academy (AJCA)
            </strong>
            .

             Oh Yeah,  There is much more to this story than meets the eye.  Too many men of power in uniform involved.  Everything points to more than just small time criminals.  Although rape of anyone is never small time.  These guys have friends in High Level Places.

            I have noticed that a LOT of pedophiles have connections to "at risk youth programs", they are usually volunteers or on boards or flat out run them. Has anyone looked into some of the major at risk youth programs and who owns them, runs them, volunteers, and on the boards? Where these places have events? Compare that to missing persons reports? Public Pictures of events to see if those kids were at the events? Who else high up/rich were at the events? What famous/elite people have connections to these programs and to known pizzagate connections?

            Filming it all is a possibility.  They possibly were creating CP for others.  Just a thought.  Men in uniform.  LE and Ministers.

             CP or even trafficking.  One of them is a Capitol Hill cop, so there's a potential connection to politicians, lobbyists, etc., etc.
