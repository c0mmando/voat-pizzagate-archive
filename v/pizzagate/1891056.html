            Yes - Clinton, Soros AND Omidyar - For some reason, Omidyar flies under the radar.  He shouldn't.  He's involved with USAid - donated $500,000 to USAid in Ukraine takeover.  His companies, including Paypal and GoFundMe, have been instrumental in demonetizing "truthers."   He owns ebay, and I wonder about a possible connection to "cheesebay."   When he bought the Intercept, he bought the Snowden leaks.  Obama named him a WH Fellow, and Omidyar visited the WH more times than Eric Schmidt.  Omidyar was crucial to the US joining the OGP under Obama - and, believe me, that is a whole other subject that deserves "outing" - it's nothing more than a precursor to global governance IMHO.
           </p>
           <p>
            ERIC is inter-operable - member states send required info to the ERIC team who then update it.  They had the ability to create registrations - how would you even detect this without going through every registration and matching it with a certifiably "real" person?    This is why, despite the convenience of online registration, the registration process needs to include the county clerk of a voter's precinct.  They researched which states allowed total online registration and which ones required the online registration data to be sent to a county clerk who then sent a fom to the person registering to sign and return.  States requiring the latter had little to no reports of unauthorized registration changes.
           </p>
           <p>
            Why was Pew offering progressively larger incentives for states to join ERIC the closer it came to the election?  Why were they funding the costs of mailing registration postcards to unregistered but eligible voters - and how many people likely to Republican received them?
           </p>
           <p>
            Another thing about ERIC - one of the big tools for marketing it (especially to Republican incumbents) was its "state of the art"  capability to remove deceased voters from the roles?  Why then, did ERIC states (especially the early members) have some of the highest incidence of deceased voters?
           </p>
           <p>
            If the post by Seth's friend is legitimate re: separate polling places and duplicate poll books, how would that fit into the strategy?  Why would they need a separate place?  Were they switching ballots of voters from other poll places?  Were they creating registered voters who did not exist?  Was the real purpose of "opening" the database to get Sander's supporter list, so they knew which ballots to intercept, and essentially use the Clinton technique of blaming someone else (Sanders campaign) for doing what Clinton team was doing?  I find it difficult to believe that Seth would have opened the database if he knew what was going on.
           </p>
           <p>
            Yes, they coordinated the info - they knew what kind of car they owned, if they were receiving government benefits, who their friends were - basically all the metadata Google collects.  They could predict very accurately, I'd assume.

            It could very well be - it's part of the whole Pew, Google, Democracy Fund project.

            At the time I was researching this, it seemed that most voting apps were connected to Pew and Google in one way or another.  I started working on this in early 2016 when people's registrations were changed without their authorization.  I believe they used the demographic data to determine which precincts would be heavily Sanders and that the shortage of ballots (necessitating provisional ballots) was planned.
           </p>
           <p>
            It got to the point where I could predict, based on legislation/ERIC adoption, who would win a certain state.
           </p>
           <p>
            You are absolutely correct that these programs have been barely mentioned.  Can you imagine if President Trump's best friend's company designed and marketed a voter registration program that was funded by a clearly partisan group?  It would  be all over the place.
           </p>
           <p>
            Another thing:  Why in the world would Pew dissolve their Election Initiatives program so close to the general election - especially when many states had recently joined ERIC and likely needed support?
           </p>
           <p>
            Thank you for taking the information seriously - hundreds of hours went into this, and everything is documented - mostly from government sources.  Like you said, it is very complex.

             Amazing research. I was unable to respond because of personal issues -- but this is outstanding.  I am particularly intrigued by Google's involvement inasmuch as Eric Schmidt essentially pledged to deliver 2016 for Hillary -- and interestingly, took on Eric Braverman for his Schmidt Foundation after Braverman left the Clinton Foundation.  That ERIC incorporated demographic data to predict which precincts would be heavily for Sanders makes complete sense to me and fits in with what I learned about PANDA's potential in this regard.  I also think it is rather interesting that a video surfaced of Seth at an Election Summit at American University August 2015 asking about provisional ballots - I wonder why this was filmed, too and who released it now.  As someone deeply concerned about voter protection it would make sense that he was aware of the potential for provisional ballots and how poll workers were to be instructed on their use.

              Wikileaks revealed in April 2014, Schmidt sent Hillary Clinton aide Cheryl Mills a detailed plan for the 2016 campaign, writing "If we get started soon, we will be in a very strong position to execute well for 2016." The plan laid out ideas for the campaign, like where it should be headquartered and who should be hired.  The Voter Expansion Project got underway in 2014 and it was a Clinton project.  WJC delivered a speech about it (video at YouTube).  Schmidt pledged his support to Hillary in June.  Schmidt also offered the Google plane for a trip to Africa with 20 top donors and wanted specifically to meet with WJC.  This was in November 2015.

              Seth joined the Voter Expansion Project in June 2014. It officially launched at the Winter 2014 DNC Conference.  Check out the DNC Task Force members - Eric Schmidt is one of them.

              It is interesting to realize that this whole enterprise was conceived BEFORE Bernie ever got into the race -- nobody expected him and I would wager they certainly didn't expect how it took off.  Bernie threw a wrench into it all when he jumped in in May 2015.

            Thank you!  I agree that VEP was used for nefarious purposes.  They DID work through Secretary's of State.  They did work with groups that were clearly partisan - aside from funding the $26 million to the project below, the grantor also donated to the Clinton Foundation and $100,000 to #neverTrump.  I've been posting about this since before the general election, but it's never received traction.  Please forgive the style - I'm not a writer - what I am is convinced TPTB control the Voter Registration databases in at least 26 states.

            We all know about Hillary Clinton's connections to Soros' Open Society. Not so much is known about her relation to Civil Society which parallels Open Society and shares many of the same sponsors. But there IS a relationship, and Civil Society wanted Clinton elected too.

            ERIC was released in 2012. In June of 2012, Hillary Clinton had a one-hour closed-press/off-the-record meeting with the Pew Foundation Board of Directors. Are the two events related?  I'm not certain, but considering the 2012 meeting is the only one referenced in all of the Wikileaks releases, the timing is quite coincidental.

           <p>
            In comparison to other voter registration systems, ERIC incorporates a wider range of data, including SSA, DMV and Human Services. ERIC includes not only registered voters but also those who are eligible to vote but not registered - a cornucopia of demographic data. ERIC also has access to the Social Security Death Index which leads one to ask why some of the earliest ERIC states had the highest incidence of deceased "voters."
           </p>
           <p>
            In 2013, based on requests from various organizations (all funded by DF,) Obama signed an executive order creating the Presidential Commission on Election Administration (PCEA.) Most of the PCEA members were connected to Pew or and/or to entities receiving grants from DF.
            <a href="https://www.supportthevoter.gov/the-commission/">
             https://www.supportthevoter.gov/the-commission/
            </a>
            (DF funded)
On advice from the "stacked" PCEA, Obama appointed three EAC commissioners, all tied to DF grantees.
            <a href="https://www.eac.gov/">
             https://www.eac.gov/
            </a>
            The EAC Standards Board (SB) was reactivated in 2015, and within a month Project 1622's common-data-format for the electronic generation of blank ballots was approved. (Project 1622 was a private work group that commenced in 2009.) Intentional or not, the EAC SB deactivation allowed Project 1622 to be developed without oversight, and the re-activation coincided with Project 1622's completion - essentially eliminating competition from other technology developers.

           <p>
            Meanwhile, DF funded Civic Designs' development of a Remote Ballot Marking System (RBMS.)

            Ohio (a recent ERIC join) indicated they were "testing" Random Ballot Marking Systems (RBMS) in the general election.   That proves RBMS was operable - probably in at least the 21 ERIC states.

           <p>
            On September 27, 2016 the NCSL ( DF grantee) released “Electronic Transmission of Ballots States.”   Clearly, access to voter databases, the ability to create blank electronic ballots for any precinct and remotely mark them could be dangerous in the wrong hands.

            In late 2015, Pew amplified its ERIC marketing, particularly in closed primary states. David Becker, enjoined the PCEA, NCSL and other DF grantees, to market ERIC. Incumbents who promoted ERIC received contributions from out-of-state individuals, seemingly unrelated Pew employees, and Emily's List.
           </p>
           <p>
            In late 2015, Pew began offering grants to states who joined ERIC and transferred all their voter information by May 31, 2016. Why? Pew also gave states funding to cover mailing costs of registration postcards to eligible voters. (Were cards mailed to all eligible voters, or were they filtered by demographics?) States were joining ERIC as late as July of 2016.
           </p>
           <p>
            After this flurry of activity, Pew surprisingly announced in August that they were "winding down" their election programs due to "funding cuts." Within a month, Becker and Amy Cohen (Director, Pew's Voting Information Project, a partnership with Google) formed "Election Innovations."  Becker testified at the Science Committee Hearing on Cybersecurity in Elections in September.

            DF's influence also extended to Vote By Mail (VBM.) Tammy Patrick, VBM National Coordinator, had ties to Pew, the PCEA, Bipartisan Policy Institute (a DFgrantee,) and Project1622. Prior to the general election, Patrick sent a letter to USPS, explaining she did not want USPS to be burdened by the influx of ballots and would provide her own staff to handle the operation. Interestingly, the USPS link for election mail resources leads to Election Center (a DF grantee)

            The Tides Foundation is closely linked with many other groups involving including the Center for American Progress, the Rockefellers and the Rockefeller Brothers Fund, the Rothschilds, the Clintons, Podestas, Bushes, McCain, and both secret and official organizations such as the Pilgrims Society, United Nations (see Sustainability and Sustainable Development), Council on Foreign Relations, World Bank, Trilateral Commission and other groups that have been corrupted and compromised. They all link back to Racine, Wisconsin.

            This dives into the merger of business, politics, religion, media, and climate control / sustainability. Everyone needs to focus on the word "Sustainability". This is a mechanism for control and collusion.

            Paid Congressional Junkets (Source: Legistorm) -

John Kline, (R-MN) traveled to Istanbul, Turkey May 30 to June 5, 2005 “To participate in a conference on political Islam” at a cost of $7,844.30 paid by the Rockefeller Brothers Fund.

            Some additional connections with the Tides Foundation may be worth further exploration such as the Center for American Progress, Further Fund of Tides Foundation, MEDICC (linked with Racine Dominicans), Jewish Voice for Peace (who held a march in Racine), the Democratic Party of Wisconsin, and Wisconsin Voices.
