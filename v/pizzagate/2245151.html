<p>There has been reference to CERN\'s Alice in a few prior pizzagate posts.  Q\'s Alice in Wonderland comments may very well have nothing to do with CERN,.  Nonetheless, CERN is pizzagate relevant in regards to their radical experiments which appear to coincide with the NWO\'s goal of global domination by the elites who are the primary source of crimes against children.</p>
<p>A book was written in 1995 by Robert Gilmore, a particle physicist, called &quot;Alice in Quantumland.&quot;. It is an allegory of quantum physics, in the dictionary sense of a &quot;narrative describing one subject under the guise of another.&quot;  The Quantumland in which Alice travels is rather like a theme park in which Alice is sometimes an observer, while sometimes she behaves as a sort of particle with varying electrical charge.  The Quantumland shows the essential failures of the &quot;quantum world&quot;: the world that we all inhabit.</p>
<p>Niel Bohr, a famous Danish physicist who made fundamental contributions to understanding atomic structure and quantum theory once said:
&quot;Anyone who is not shocked by quantum theory has not understood it.&quot;</p>
<p>Quantum theory/mechanics/physics is intimidating, weird, and can be counter-intuitive even for physicists who deal with it everyday.  It is the part of physics that tells how the things that make up atoms work.  It tells how electromagnetic waves (like light) work.  It is a mathematical framework for much of modern physics and chemistry and helps make sense of the smallest things in nature - protons, neutrons, and electrons.</p>
<p>CERN is The European Organization for Nuclear Research.  The word CERN is derived from the name &quot;Conseil European pour la Recherche Nucleaire.&quot;   It is located in a suburb of Geneva on the Franco-Swiss border that operates the largest particle physics lab in the world.  Its main function is to probe the fundamental structure of the universe and study the basic constituents of matter.</p>
<p>Alice is a heavy ion detector on the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) ring.  The LHC is the world\'s largest and most powerful particle accelerator.  Accelerators provide energetic particles to investigate the structure of the atomic nucleus. Their job is to speed up and increase the energy..</p>
<p>Alice is designed to study the physics of strongly interacting matter at extreme energy densities, where a phase of matter called quark-gluon plasma forms.  CERN physicists recreate conditions that existed in the universe just after the Big Bang.  For a few millionths of a second, shortly after the Big Bang, the universe was filled with an astonishingly hot, dense soup made of all kinds of particles moving at near light speed.  This mixture was dominated by quarks - fundamental bits of matter - and by gluons, carriers of the strong force that normally &quot;glue&quot; quarks together into familiar protons and neutrons.  In those first moments of extreme temperature, however, quarks and gluons were bound only weakly, free to move on their own in what\'s called a quark-gluon plasma.  
</p>
<p>There was also a great deal of excitement regarding the creation of hadrons.  A hadron is a composite particle made of quarks held together by a strong force in a similar way as molecules are held together by electromagnetic force.  This creation opens up an entirely new dimension for the study of the properties of the fundamental state that our universe emerged from.</p>
<p>All of this is scary stuff.</p>
<p>For part of each year, the LHC provides collisions between lead ions, recreating in the laboratory conditions similar to those just after the Big Bang.  The ALICE collaboration counts more than 1000 scientists from over 100 physics institutes in 30 countries.  It has begun planning for its own massive super-collider and they want to develop a particle accelerator 3 times larger than LHC.  CERN has a budget of about $1 billion Swiss francs ($1.04 billion) per year.</p>
<p>It has been said that CERN serves as the secret entrance to CIA headquarters which is located in the underwater Alpine canyons of Lake Geneva and is only accessible via underground trains from CERN and via submarines which travel through a 170-mile subterranean tunnel which begins in Genoa, Italy and ends up in Lake Geneva.  The notion that CERN is the secret entrance is corroborated by the fact that in 2013, CERN had 2,513 staff members and 12,313 fellows, associates, and apprentices, a majority of which are likely CIA personnel.  Approximately 15,000 employees commute to CERN on a daily basis, and they must do so via secret underground trains as there are no major parking lots at CERN as seen in an aerial view of CIA in Langley, VA.</p>
<p>Israel is the only non-European country granted full membership to CERN.</p>
<p>Another interesting fact is that the Worldwide Web began as a CERN project named ENQUIRE, initiated by Tim Berners-Lee in 1989 and Robert Cailliau in 1990, so CERN wields almost absolute power over Earth, most of which is run by supercomputers.  Whatever agency has power over CERN, essentially rules the world, which leads me into...</p>
<p>A discovery I made which may be already known by many is that the Cerner Corporation based in Kansas City, MO and CERN are sort of one-in-the-same entity.  The NASDAQ symbol for both is &quot;CERN.&quot;  Cerner was founded in 1979 by Neal Patterson (who recently died from cancer), Pard Goru, and Cliff Illig who were colleagues at Arthur Anderson.  It\'s original name was PGI &amp; Associates but was renamed Cerner in 1984. Its webpage states they &quot;build intelligent solutions for the healthcare industry, connecting people and systems at more than 27,000 facilities worldwide.  By designing leading-edge health information technology, they offer strategies that enable organizations to know, manage, and engage their populations.&quot;  On August 5, 2014, Cerner Corp. acquired Siemens Health Services for $3.1 billion.</p>
<p>On July 29, 2015, Leídos Partnership for Defense Health, which includes Cerner, Accenture, and Leídos, was awarded a 10-year $4.3 billion contract to overhaul and manage the electronic health records (EHR) for the DOD.  
</p>
<p>Also in 2015, Cerner and other companies paid for a report by the RAND Corporation which predicted great efficiencies from EHR, including savings of $81 billion a year or more, which RAND later said was  overstated.  This report, however, helped drive the growth of EHR and billions of dollars in 
federal incentives to hospitals and doctors.  Cerner\'s revenue tripled from $1 billion in 2005 to a projected $3 billion in 2013.  Cerner has positioned itself as the leading provider of EHR software.  For instance, Epic Systems based in Verona, WI, was passed on bidding for work in its own backyard, giving Epic\'s main rival, Cerner, a $33 million contract for the digital health information system planned by the Wisconsin Department of Health Services.  Cerner is also working on developing the Veterans Affairs EHR - a project it was awarded without competitive bid.</p>
<p>To date, however,  legal battles are on the rise over EHR\'s and patient safety.  For years, patient safety advocates have warned that EHR systems carry numerous potential risks due to their poor design and the ease with which data entry errors can lead to medical mistakes. Lawyers are catching on and instead of simply blaming negligence on medical personnel are now going after the companies who provide the software.  
</p>
<p>Cerner\'s current CEO, Cliff Illig,  currently talks about the plethora of sensors that make GPS possible as it could help improve the integration and availability of health monitoring devices.  Such devices include floor pads that can tell monitors whether an elderly person has gotten out of bed in his or her house and is walking normally.  He speaks of nanotechnology sitting in a pill capsule that will send information to tell if the pill is digested after it is swallowed.  He talks of decoding the 3.2 billion DNA letters in the human genome to help healthcare providers diagnose abnormalities as there are 3,500 known genetic diseases and 20 more are discovered each month.</p>
<p>I end with this quote, and I cannot seem to locate where I found this in the links provided:
&quot;The essence of science is it\'s predictability and capacity to verify truth from false theories.  The three fundamental threats to damage the Earth are sound truths of known-known physics, while the theories that dismiss them are neither proved.&quot;</p>

            Excellent post, very soberly and thoughtfully presented. I don't know if this is connected. Maybe CERN has an earthquake machine, I don't know. I tend to think the Russians have one and are using it to demolish the globalist pedophile elite, but that's just an hypothesis.

            What is interesting is that
            <a href="https://www.dutchsinse.com/11162017-earthquakes-are-spreading-across-the-west-pacific-planet-visible-proof-here/">
             Dutchsinse is warning today
            </a>
            that a series of very large, deep earthquakes is progressing across the West Pacific and planet and has moved half the Pacific plate beginning in the past day or two. This series of earthquakes started at the Fiji Islands, Dutch says.
           </p>
           <p>
            Fiji.
           </p>
           <p>
            Does anyone remember what happened at President Trump's press conference yesterday? He brought out a Fiji water bottle from which he ostentatiously and clumsily drank, not once but twice. Check the picture. Is this a normal way of drinking water in public in front of the whole world?

            Was President Trump trying to tell us something or just a coincidence?

            I don't know if it actually has anything to do with the q Alice or q anon at all, but I would encourage everyone not to dismiss the activities at CERN. Also the opening of the gotthard tunnel was some freaky shit!

              I dunno what the fuck that was, but, it wasn't "Satanic"... I mean I am really lost for words there other than "who the fuck signed off on the budget for that", it doesn't strike me as having anything to do with Satanism, though.
