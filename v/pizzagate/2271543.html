            There are good and bad people in the FBI.  I remember back when, after the Boston Bombing, there was that one video put out on the internet where the person was filming from the 3rd story above the finish line and caught the bomb going on off on tape.  It was all actors.  I took that video, with frame by frame photos from it to the local sheriff.  I asked to speak to a forensic officer and showed him the video....all he kept saying was "holy shit".  Then he said someone with a lot more horsepower than he had needed to see it.  He went to get his boss, but never returned.  I waited in a room, until a couple young deputies came back and told me they couldn't help me, that I needed to show that to the FBI... so I proceeded to do just that and called every FBI office I could across the country... more than 50 and got that information to them so they could see it.  Some agents I talked to were totally on board and saw it for what it was..... the video showed actors faking a bomb going off and injuries..  Many also kept saying "don't look at that stuff on the internet, tune in to a trusted news source for information".  So there are people within the FBI who know there's some serious nefarious activity going on at the highest levels on a grand scale.

              Ed Klein: Hillary's Plea Bargain
             </strong>
            </p>
            <p>
             “The Justice Department has reopened the investigation of Hillary Clinton’s mishandling of classified material on her private email system while she was secretary of state, and is considering offering her a plea bargain if she will agree to plead guilty to charges of breaking the law, according to a Clinton attorney,”
            </p>
            <p>
             Newsmax reports.
            </p>
            <hr/>
            <p>
             The discussion of a plea bargain took place late last month and was offered by a high-ranking Justice Department official to the Clinton lawyer.
            </p>
            <p>
             During the exploratory talks with the prosecutor, the Clinton attorney was told that despite former FBI Director James Comey’s decision last July not to prosecute Hillary, the Justice Department has reexamined the email case and believes there are ample grounds for prosecuting Hillary on a number of counts.
            </p>
            <hr/>
            <p>
             Under the Justice Department’s plea offer,
             <strong>
              Hillary would be required to sign a document admitting that she committed a prosecutable crime. In return, the DOJ would agree not to bring charges against Hillary in connection with the email probe.
             </strong>
            </p>
            <p>
             Also as part of the agreement, the
             <strong>
              Justice Department would not proceed with an investigation of Hillary’s pay to play deals with foreign governments and businessmen who contributed to the Clinton Foundation or who paid Bill Clinton exorbitant speaking fees.
             </strong>
            </p>
            <hr/>
            <p>
             The Clinton attorney cautioned that normally a plea is offered by a prosecutor only upon arraignment, and Hillary has not yet been charged with any crime.

             A plea bargain Hillary is distressing. What good does it do to admit to a crime they have already overlooked and have demonstrated that they will do nothing about? Then they are strapped not being able to prosecute her for any of the truly treasonous crimes. Why would anyone of that status get a deal when they have done things like uranium one? These are the kind of deals you do when you know they are going to prison for something else. But she is not. And none of the foundation shenanigans will ever be looked into.
            </p>
            <p>
             Trump can bring the money back but he should not let her off the hook!
            </p>
            <p>
             No deals for Hillary!!  Or Trump will lose.
            </p>
            <p>
             And I'm sick of her going around the world talking about what happened in the general election and how she was cheated. And no one brings up the hypocrisy of the primary where she cheated Bernie Sanders! How about a book on what happened in the primary?  She only has herself to blame for Trump. But they are after him and letting her off the hook after 30 years of crime.

              I cannot find any daycare by that name nor any similar name in Salt Lake City, Utah.

               It took me a while, but found this.  Someone had sent me something under the conspiracy sub but I could not find it.  Here is the vice article that also will have a link to 4chan report on it.

               It's an old reddit post.  I was on reddit and I remember it.  Some said and still say it may be a CIA black site.  Vice just did an article on it and posted the 4chan report on it as well.

                 I don't know what is going on there, but it is not a place anyone should send children to.  At this point we still don't know if this is a Real daycare or some kind of set up.  Imo, it is some sort of set up since, Holy Cow, who in their right mind would think this place is a good place for their child.  Are we going to see this place still come up after another year passes us by?  It will still be there looking the exact same way, the same green paint and the same lousy looking play yard and some old lady that only sometimes answers the door.  Can you imagine a daycare with some old woman manning the place?  Nah, nothing to see here folks.  BTW, thanks for sending the Reddit thread.

                Well shit the bed... let's see where it goes - I have many reasons to worry about happenings in Utah and several other nearby/connected states.

            The FBI is a disgrace to law enforcement.

            The entire department has been compromised, at least in the upper levels.

             100% agree with you FBI. THEY NEED TO DISMANTLE the fbi anf the cia. It would be impossible to get all bad apples.
