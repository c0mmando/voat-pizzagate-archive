I added the tag &quot;pizzagate&quot; fine. I then wondered if they allowed hashtags or if hashtags made any difference when searching for users with matching interests.

But my real point is: I\'m wondering if Omegle blocked #pizzagate to censor and prevent discussion of it. I can\'t think of any other reasons, as Omegle is a &quot;free speech&quot; site in that there are no rules on what you can discuss, and sexual conversations are allowed. The only rule I\'ve found on the main site is a box that says to keep the <strong>video chat</strong> clean. Nothing about restrictions of topics of discussion in the text chat. I\'m not sure if this helps or not, but hopefully someone can take something from this as I am not very good at investigation or hacking.</p>',

I added the tag "pizzagate" fine. I then wondered if they allowed hashtags or if hashtags made any difference when searching for users with matching interests.
