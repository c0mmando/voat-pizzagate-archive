<p>more information about his life and art - he was in the <a href="http://joenickp.com/texas/what-would-donald-judd-do/">Army in the 40s</a>, and became a pretty well known artist from NYC:  <a href="http://www.theartstory.org/artist-judd-donald.htm">http://www.theartstory.org/artist-judd-donald.htm</a>  / <a href="http://archive.is/yykEZ">http://archive.is/yykEZ</a></p>
<p>his last studio was located in MARFA TX <a href="http://juddfoundation.org/visit/marfa/">http://juddfoundation.org/visit/marfa/</a>  
</p>
<p>(Marfa is the site of Judge Scalias death and reported Human Hunts - Dick Cheney &quot;accidently&quot; shot his buddy near there as well)</p>
<p>while in Marfa, he created these large concrete art pieces - <a href="https://www.chinati.org/collection/donaldjudd2.php">https://www.chinati.org/collection/donaldjudd2.php</a> /  <a href="http://archive.is/N3L1L">http://archive.is/N3L1L</a></p>

<p>he owned a LOT of land in Marfa: (from wiki) </p>
<p>&quot;In 1971 he rented a house in Marfa, Texas as an antidote to the hectic New York art world. From this humble house he would later buy numerous buildings and a 60,000 acre (243 kmÂ²) Ayala de Chinati Ranch (not open to the public), almost all carefully restored to his exacting standards. 40,000 acres surrounding the three ranch headquarters were sold under a conservation easement, but Judd Foundation still maintains the buildings and the land immediately surrounding them.&quot;</p>

<p>question: why would a succesful NYC artist - suddenly move to the middle of nowhere bumfuck texas and start creating large concrete structures?</p>
<p>my theory: Judd was in the know being in the art scene  - he was contracted by our government (CIA) to build large underground installations - which double as cells for Humans, very possible illegals crossing the border are being housed there before being hunted, used for further purposes - etc</p>
<p>very possible much of this in on his private ranch,  Ayala de Chinati Ranch</p>
<p>-OR-</p>
<p>Judd is someone people admire because they like large square rooms.  I don\'t claim to understand how a concrete square could be considered &quot;art&quot;... but that\'s just me - </p>
<p>of note: concrete is great for soundproofing, nothing would be heard through walls that thick, esp underground</p>
<p>something just seems strange about this whole thing</p>
<p>makes me wonder.....what WOULD Donald Judd do?</p>',

            I think it means what would dr Jenn do. Dr. Jenn Mann has a photo on instagram with a pendant "#wwdjd" and some tweets use this hashtag with her in mind. She is famous for hosting family therapy show on VHS1 AND, WAIT FOR IT, also the author of few books about "RAISING KIDS"

            It does seem like an insider meme that the rest of us are left to speculate about. They seem to know what it means. I expect the fun in it is it's the exact opposite of the wwjd meme. I think you're on the right track where the answer to the meme question is "bury bodies in it" or something,: but the possibility of a group knowing about some great secret that they create mainstream memes for while only keeping the major details about it among themselves would seem to be a difficulty.

            I remember looking those letters up when I first saw that instagram and couldn't understand the "do" part. I'm glad you filled that in.

            Yep, it's pretty much the people who are pushing the easily debunkable "Scalia assassinated by Podesta" theory that are pushing the "Scalia pedophile" slander. The shills love talking about Podesta assassinating Scalia because it can go nowhere and keeps the focus of forums directed away from more dangerous territory for them.

            Larry Clark is a creep - he made the controversial film "KIDS".

           <p>
            "His work focuses primarily on youth who casually engage in illegal drug use, underage sex, and violence, and who are part of a specific subculture"
