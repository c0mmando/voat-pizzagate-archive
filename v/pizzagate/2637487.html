            I wasn't there at the very inception of this scandal, as I started looking into it on November 4th, 2016, but as I recall, the term Pizzagate was not in wide usage at that point. The first usage of the term may have been by Instagram user "Pizzagate2016", who created the account to annoy Alefantis on IG before he set his account to private.

            "Pizzagate" was in wide use pre-NYT.    It began on Reddit (The_Donald and later a specific thread dedicated to "Pizzagate" which was axed a few weeks in by Reddit).  It was also active on 4chan.    It was all an outgrowth of the "Spirit Cooking" discussions.
           </p>
           <p>
            This was a Vietnam-style guerilla political warfare effort.   Hillary was attacked with a number of funny memes (one highlighting her desire to have women register for the draft and serve in the military via a draft) and weaponized conspiracy theories.
           </p>
           <p>
            There were great visuals with Spirit Cooking.  Those could be memed and shared on facebook, 4chan, reddit, and emailed around.  There was no way Hillary/Podesta could explain Satanic rituals as "art" to middle America.  There was nothing they could say.  Their rejection of legitimate questions was gasoline on that fire.
           </p>
           <p>
            Then they really had no explanation for the Instagram photos and comments.   So the stories ignored it.  The memes and images circulated and there were no real explanations.  The Podesta emails (his personal emails) with the odd pizza language had no real explanation.  The art collection John's brother had was also repulsive and great images to win over voters.
           </p>
           <p>
            This was a political 'shock and awe' campaign that spread like wildfire.  It was particularly effective keeping African-American voters from showing up to support Hillary.   Their record-shattering Obama turnout got him elected the second time around as that was a close race.
           </p>
           <p>
            NYT denying it and Snopes, etc. debunking just showed they were part of the conspiracy.  That's the beauty of a great conspiracy theory: if you deny it, you're part of the conspiracy.
           </p>
           <p>
            Realizing how effective it was, Podesta decided to create their own conspiracy theory when they lost.  Election night the great Russian Conspiracy Theory was born and we've been stuck there with the MSM ever since.   There's no evidence the Russians ever hacked anything (DNC refused to hand over the servers; Lisa Page now says China did the actual hacking), but it doesn't matter.  If you question our FBI/CIA, then you're part of the conspiracy.  You're supporting the enemies of America.   A plausible conspiracy theory as a political weapon.

            They called us Indians because they thought they had reached India from the Atlantic. We adopted it, and still call each other Injuns, just as Black skinned people call themselves niggers. No difference. Pizzagate is catchy, and attracted people who like pizza out of curiosity. Pedogate works too.

            You blame the media for having trouble making sense of what pizzagate is.  The blame actually lies in the total incoherence of the original argument and the means of investigation.  Basically if we change all the meanings of words we can make someone's inbox look really sinister and then blame them for it.

             You're deliberately missing VZ's point. He's saying the investigation only
             <em>
              started
             </em>
             with weird emails like the "handkerchief" with a "pizza-related map" on it. Millions of people wouldn't have given this more than a passing glance...except it turned out that Tony Podesta actually has a collection of pedo art, including images of a man raping an infant on top of a spread out handkerchief to catch the telltale genetic evidence. Suddenly that nonsensical email ("Who draws a map to a pizza place on a handkerchief? WTF?") has a very clear, logical and horrifying meaning. So don't be coy and lecture us about Fake Scotsmen fallacies. You are merely continuing the same tactic the NYT used: define the situation in terms you can discard.

             I think timing wise, it didn't actually begin on Reddit. But we might be talking a matter of days or even hours. This was likely a coordinated effort to litter the internet with this term. Maybe the term came from Reddit, but the NYT was the first to make up the definition as we know it today, does that seem correct?

                My argument is the very title of this thread is completely false and it's very easy to prove your argument is false.  And referencing the hashtag means it had to already be in use  and people knew what the reference was too. If people understood the reference, it could be defined.

                  Podesta's gmail password was not password and no one simply guessed his password.  His gmail password was actually Runner4657.   Podesta's emails were hacked through a spearfishing campaign that also targeted a lot of other people Colin Powell's emails were also hacked.

                  All of your other stuff is not evidence but claims.  Claims for which you have no evidence. 
There are no code words used in Podesta emails. Zero.  Provide your evidence for this claim....the whole pizzagate theory rests on this.

                 <p>
                  Yes, Tony Podesta mentioned being in the torture chamber that's a fact.  But you have no evidence that is not a simple metaphor which is commonly used.  I heard someone say today at work was torture this week.  She works in marketing for a supermarket chain.

                    No link was ever given for the code word list.  In fact it didn't even come from a web page.  Some anonymous guy just made up a list and screenshotted it.  That's what all the claims are based on.  An anonymous post with a made up list with no source at all.

                    If you search the web for evidence that ice cream = male prostitute you won't find anything before pizzagate because the list is a hoax.   You will find no evidence that map = semen.   It's all garbage.

                     No. Most of the code words like hot dogs, pizza and cheese, make NO SENSE in the emails and for that reason,  made people look into what they might mean. They quickly found what the FBI also has, that those are words to refer to sex (and often trafficking) of children. "Chicken" often refers to little boys (see "chicken lover") and children (rather than chickens) are the common sacrifice for Mollock in their religion which goes back ages.

                    <p>
                     People use code words not to hide things from those they know, but from authorities, when those things are illegal. Drug dealers have been doing this for a long time too.

                      A. This is not true, they do make sense.   Ever one of them can be understood as is.  These email were read in a context of hyperpartisan hatred by a group determined to find dirt and then if there was no dirt to find to manufacture it.  And they did.

                      B. The emails are not directed at you, it's somebody else's conversation.  People you don't know and don't know how they normally speak.

                      Stop right there.  This is false.  go look this up.   The FBI found nothing about these words.   No need arguing further.....this is a false premise for the rest of your argument.

                        Obama never did.  That was gossip from an Obama hating guy in Austin, TX.  Not an insider.  Most of the details about that are completely wrong.  Obama was having his favorite pizzamaker from Pi pizza in St Louis make pizza at the White House.  This caused a minor controversy from pizzamakers in Chicago, that Obama who is from Chicago didn't choose a Chicago guy.  This then morphed into a controversy on right wing media who were trying to portray Obama as an out of touch elitist, that he had the guy flown in a private plane.  (There was controversy at the time over auto CEOs flying into Washington to ask for a bailout.) This spawned a controversy about Obama not being environmentally sounds, a different controversy about Obama using a government plane to fly the guy in and waste taxpayer dollars, etc. This was all over right wing media/social media for a while but the stories had it wrong.  The guy flew from St Louis to DC commercial, they timed it for when he was going to be in DC anyone and he donated his time and his food.   The White House actually paid $0 for this pizza party and the pizza guy got like a million bucks free publicity, he went on the morning talk shows.    You know what they called this controversy back in 2009?  Pizzagate.  I kid you not.  Check out the end of this article

               IT ALL STARTED WITH THE WIKILEAKS CLINTON / PODESTA EMAIL DUMPS
              </p>
              <p>
               One of the Chans or Reddit noticed emails between Uma and Hillary regarding the Laura Silsby affair in Haiti. They were surprised that she was aware of Silsby's "ministry" before Haiti. Of course Silsby had been convicted of child trafficking in Haiti. The Clintons were instrumental in getting her out of jail. Researching this led to other connections and references in the emails, including Comet Pizza and owner James Alefantis. The inclusion of the FBI pedo symbols in the wikileaks dump led to more discoveries. The odd pizza references from Podesta and friends as well as a fundraiser held at Comet Pizza drew the investigator's attention. Early access to Alefantis' public Instagrams as well as friends' comments really opened the door into a non-mainstream culture. It was discovered that Alefantis was listed as 49th most powerful in DC by an established magazine. This seemed very odd, so Alefantis' connections were examined which led to David Brock and even Lynn Rothschild, and of course Hillary Clinton and John Podesta via the fundraising circuit. The Alefantis Instagram photos referred to a "kill room" and showed perhaps unregistered building modifications on Alefantis property which included what appeared to be a tunnel of some sort and many other creepy images including lots of children. The more researchers dug, the darker it got. To sum it up, it was a more ORGANIC discovery made by numbers of random researchers, who didn't necessarily know each other, nor were they formally organized. Different groups emphasized different areas of research at the beginning. Most initially knew nothing about child trafficking or pedo culture. Knowledge increased over time. And yes, Jimmy Comet does own a basement. It is in his Buck's Fishing and Camping restaurant a few doors down from Comet Ping Pong. Both restaurants have two stories -  Buck's has a basement and the main floor restaurant. Comet has the main floor restaurant and a second story above. How it is utilized, no one knows for sure. Later, a researcher claimed to have hacked Comet's website and found cp on it. He allegedly reported his findings to the DC police and received a written receipt acknowledging this. A few days later, actor Maddison Welch shows up at Comet and allegedly shot the computer tower, although there were no direct witnesses. Many researchers believed the incident to be a FF.  Early on, the MSM tried to discredit researchers as more of their findings leaked out to the masses. I do not think they coined the term Pizzagate. I think it just became know as that by researchers as the information regarding the pizza code words grew. Of course the MSM had to call it something, in order to discredit the research, so the name Pizzagate was used. Personally, I think the name has helped our cause because it generates curiosity and people would seek out info on it. It also helps to expose the very real use of food terms by pedo culture and disrupts their covert operations. Still not sure about the pizza connection? Just "duck duck go" this: miley cyrus lips pizza photos

                 The Clinton Silsby theory that Craddick claimed is completely false as I have shown several times.   Very few folks on here have the intellectual honesty to admit that.

                 There's several thing false here.  Clinton was not aware of Silsby at all before she was arrested as I shown over and over.  Most recently here

                 Craddick/Pleading the Yiff made the false claim that Hilary Clinton knew about Silsby from 2001.  He made this false claim based on this document.

                 This document was found on the website of the East Falls Baptist Church in Idaho after Silsby was arrested. It was obviously written after the Haitian Earthquake from 2010.  Craddick claims it was an email from 2001.  It was not an email.  It was an attachment to this email.  It's document called nIcrhaitianorphanrescuemission.pdf

                 So we know exactly how that document got in Hillary's inbox because it's explained in that email.
                </p>
                <blockquote>
                 <p>
                  The group is called the New Life Children Refuge America Organization (NLCR). Bill Bistransky found the attached "Plan of Action"(P0A) on their web site when he googled that name.
                 </p>
                </blockquote>
                <p>
                 We know the exact date that got in Hilary's inbox.  We know that nobody at the State Department knew who this group was before their arrested and they didn't know who Silsby was before her arrest.
                </p>
                <p>
                 Craddick's claim is false.  So there only case of child trafficking connected to Pizzagate IS NOT CONNECTED at all.   None of the emails about Silsby existed before she was arrested.  All that followed was not because of any personal connection to Silsby, but because the State Department gets involved when Americans are arrested overseas.  Period.
                </p>
                <p>
                 These two other claims you make are also false
                </p>
                <blockquote>
                 <p>
                  Of course Silsby had been convicted of child trafficking in Haiti. The Clintons were instrumental in getting her out of jail.
                 </p>
                </blockquote>
                <p>
                 Silsby was not convicted of child trafficking.  In fact, she was never charged with child trafficking.  She was facing charges of kidnapping and criminal association. These charges were dropped by the Haitian courts.  This is mostly likely because Silsby actually had permission from the parents to take the kids, the kidnapping charges probably wouldn't have held up in court.
                </p>
                <blockquote>

                 The Clintons were not instrumental in getting her out of jail.   She was convicted on a lesser charge and sentenced to time served.   The State Department explicitly rejected appeals from Baptists leaders for the Clintons to get involved.

            In the earlier days, there was a lot of talk about the basement and the systems of tunnels that run under DC. Also the Hillary fundraising event that took place at CPP raised a lot of (very immediate) concerns about CPP being a hub or at least a spoke in child-running.

             Indeed. There was a lot of talk about all that we were uncovering, but in the early days we never zeroed in on ANY single assertion, nor do we even today. In the early days we were a whirlwind of information and evidence, and questions. But no one, NO ONE, ever cooked up the theory that ended up defining us, that is, not before the NYT asserted otherwise.

             So while we did mention a lot about the underground systems, and about Comet's central role, no one ever said Hillary ran the damn thing. And throwing in the detail about the basement only led us to run in circles clarifying about Alefantis having access to a basement through his other restaurant right next door. When all the time we spent defending ourselves, we should have used to show that the NYT lied outright. The result they wanted was exactly what they got. We can't show our face in public, and no serious person dares to mention pizzagate. All the while, the NYT retains credibility among the masses.

             I personally hounded the author of this piece, because I had been reading literally everything about this at the time, and her article was so off base and looked nothing like what I was exposed to with regard to pizzagate. I asked her to please show me where she was getting her facts. She ignored me.

             Yes, the MSM has a lot of power, but when they blatantly lie we must do our best to expose that fact.
