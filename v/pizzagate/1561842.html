<p>You probably already know this.  On a hunch, I decided to do some digging into major news headlines on those dates.  I found a strange coincidence, almost too strange.   
</p>
<p>I used my school database resources to search periodical archives, but quickly found mirrors for this specific string of reports on google.  The following was posted to whitehouse.gov.</p>
<p>&quot;Fact Sheet: the Obama Administration Announces Efforts to Combat Human Trafficking at Home and Abroad&quot;  
</p>
<p>The above headline was published directly from the white house <strong>the day before</strong> Alefantis\' first late night visit, and reached mainstream news sources the next day.  I\'ll provide a link to the whitehouse.gov version below.  I felt the following excerpt was extremely relevant as I no longer believe in coincidence.  
</p>
<p>&quot;&quot;&quot;To strengthen the U.S. Government’s existing zero-tolerance policy on human trafficking in government contracting, the President has issued an Executive Order that outlines prohibitions on trafficking-related activities that will apply to all federal contractors and subcontractors, requires compliance measures for large overseas contracts and subcontracts, and provides federal agencies with additional tools to foster compliance.&quot;&quot;&quot;</p>
<p>The timing has me baffled.</p>

<p>One more thing.  The day before Alefantis\' visit, Obama gives a speech about child trafficking to members of the Clinton Global Initiative.  He makes remarks about child trafficking being out of control, especially in Los Angeles.    (Sep 25, 2012)  Link below.</p>

            You're right about not everyone being a Trump supporter but I understand how one could think so because normally there's nothing a Democrat politician can do that would make a Democrat voter turn on them.

             I find that highly insulting, if you please.  I take that as an offense.  I have Dem friends that voted for Trump because of their hatred for Hillary and Obama.  They voted for BO twice. So did I.  I did not vote for Trump.  Stein.  The statement you just made sounds as if you believe that Dem voters would not turn on a Dem politician even if they violated children.  We are not that dumb.  Believe me there are Rep voters that will not believe the stuff about the Bush Fam and St. Ronnie either.  I have been both a Dem. and Rep.  even a Rep. Election Judge.  I turned on both parties.  Now I am an Independent.  Please do not make blanket statements.

              The truth of the matter is that pretty much anyone who is still affiliated with the Democrat Party at this point are at best very very low information people and highly indoctrinated. I'm sorry if that truth offends you. However you aren't one of those people because you left the DP. You're correct there are Republican voter that are very party loyal too. They are almost as bad as the Democrat voters only with slightly better morals.
             </p>
             <p>
              That said, i have the right to speak my mind and you have the same right and with that right we will often be "insulted" and "offended", two words that TPTB, most notably on the Democrat side, love to throw around to shut down the speech they don't want to hear or others to hear. It's too bad you haven't left that habit behind when you left the DP. Try to be more open to what others say and maybe you'll hear truth that you had heretofore closed your ears to and begin to see the world in a new way. I don't mean to be mean here. But we want others to hear what we tell them about pizzagate and on the other hand maybe there are some things that we too need to learn.

               Believe me there are people from both parties that do not want to hear the truth.  If it makes you feel better to be in the group that is just a little better than another group then I am happy for you.  I will keep meeting with my group that my Democrat Friends and I started that includes many Republicans and Independents that are now agreeing to join together for we all want the same things.  Good Luck To You &amp; Have A Nice Evening.

            It's maybe time to consider that Alefantis could be a government agent infiltrated in a child trafficking ring to take them down.
           </p>
           <p>
            Everything was too easy... How a real "elite child trafficker" (not a retarded guy) can possibly have a so weird public instagram ?
           </p>
           <p>
            It's like he is giving us leads...  "hey guys, look here ! i'm an entry point for you !"
           </p>
           <p>
            Just an hypothesis, but should be considered

            Not meaning to sound snarky or snotty, but we've known this or I've known this for a while. Did you also see who was with him in attendance? Go back and look more closely- a known pornstar was there at the same time. He has two names. I will find it if noone else beats me to the punch to post it.

             You can find the names in the Whitehouse logs.Chris Crocker also admitted it he was there but didn't know Alefantis previously.  Rense is not well documented but the names are there together- "James Alefantis, Christopher Moukarbel, Chris Crocker aka Cunningham, and Chelsea Swanger at a two-night performance September 26-27, 2012.

            Actually they are BOTH sides. This is the hidden hand at work... they traffic - then they set up a false opposition, therefore controlling the entire narrative. They do this over and over in many arenas.

             Excellent framing!  I wouldn't have the words to describe what you've just stated about "setting up a false opposition therefore controlling the entire narrative."  Thanks!  BTW:  that's exactly what they do to create a win-win situation for themselves.

             I've been watching West World, and this type of narrative control is at play. It's uncanny.

               Yeah, West World also hinted at cannibalism as a potential narrative. I just watched the finale last night.

              I watched Westworld recently too and few things struck me. 1. Ford asks for a "blood sacrifice to the Gods".  Who are the Gods and how many are they? And 2. The line "It doesn't look like anything to me" refers to us, "common" people. We are the programed robots. The pedosatanists (because that's what they are) do everything in plain sight, but people can't see it because they have no references. 
When I talk about pizzagate the most common reaction I get is "this sounds terrible, but tell me how was your day?" Anyway I have a strong feeling that the Nolan brothers are satanic pizzaeaters too.

               I'm on episode 10 right now, just have to watch the last half of the finale. But yeah, the MKUltra is strong with this one.  I think the maze refers to the pineal/third eye.

            good work.  but could we stop using the term 'pedes' when referring to PG researchers?  i understand the origins of it, but it's too similar to the 'pedos' we're trying to fry.

            James also had a meeting with Jared Ostermiller (4/7/14 12:22) responsible for the Presidents budget oversight. Perhaps they were discussing what account Pizza's and Hotdogs should fall under.

            You know - and this is complete speculation - i posted a theory last week or so where I was wondering whether the $65k 'hotdogs &amp; pizza' email was an entrapment. Was Alefantis visiting the whitehouse to ISSUE A WARNING?
Obama absolutely knows about the paedomafia and he is undoubtedly compromised by them - but I do wonder whether he is a participant. This kind of makes me doubt it further
           </p>
           <p>
            IMPORTANT IMPLICATION: If Obama is just compromised but not an actual official participant in the paedomafia, then he stands a better chance of working with Trump after the inauguration. Maybe the whole russia thing with obama setting up a potential 'jump trump for treason just before handover' is his insurance policy. Your post gives me hope.

              I have been thinking about that too.  Am not really good at the legal stuff but the comment above about them meeting to discuss how they were going to explain the expense is a very good point.  I and I am sure others would love to stick it to them royally. By the way I am watching Biden get the Medal of Honor from BO.  It literally makes me sick.

             I believe that email is one of 2 things. Obama  used $65,000 of taxpayer money for his private party to provide food, which is horrendous and it's stealing from taxpayers. OR Obama used $65000 of taxpayer money for his private party to provide hotdogs and pizza (in pedophile lingo), which is horrendous and it's stealing from taxpayers.
            </p>
            <p>
             Either way~he was making taxpayers pay for his private party~and HRC wanted to make sure she used the same channels to use taxpayer money for her own use.
            </p>
            <p>
             Not one person in America should be OK with what Obama did and everyone should be angry that HRC was looking to do the same. The man gets EVERYTHING FOR FREE for him and his family, housing, food, everything PLUS 400K a year and is set for life with income paid by taxpayers, but he just wanted to make sure to put a big Fuck U on the taxpayers while letting veterans homeless, healthcare skyrocket, etc. Yeah he wasted a lot more on a lot of BS, but this is his personal party. $65,000 of food (or worse children for fucking). And this is just one time that happened to be in the email, imagine all the other times he did this for his personal fun. Fuck him and Fuck her, Fuck the entire government.

               indeed - the email isnt to or from Obama.  But a paedo-mafia member could have sent it in order to be able to implicate Obama and compel him to come to the pedomafia's defence, in the event that he may not be a participant

             I think you're on to something.  Ive never thought Obama was directly involved, maybe not even the Clintons.  But there's apparently some sort of political connection between the two.  Could sex trafficking and the child porn industry be such a large contributor to the nation's economy that some people in power actively try to keep it going?

              there's faaaaar too much smoke from the clintons for there not to be fire. C'mon. 32 fights to Epstein's isleand between bill &amp; hillary. Silsby. George webbs videos on clinton foundation trafficking. sacrificing a chicken to moloch. their closeness to the podestas.

             <p>
              Obama on the other hand really only has this one $65k email - and it wasnt to or from Obama himself.  So it could be a false email sent #AreWeSure with the purpose of implication, meaning that if the paedo-mafia gets busted, they use this email to compel Obama to defend them even if he doesnt encourage/participate. I could be wrong, he could well be a kiddydiddling fiend.  But the trail of smoke from obama is distinctly thinner

            Good find. The timing is really bizarre for sure. But is it? Barrack Obama and Hillary Clinton go out of their way to say they are the most transparent people in American History. Meanwhile back in reality they are the EXACT opposite, they're the most OPAQUE politicians in American History.
           </p>
           <p>
            So you go out of your way to prove you're fighting human trafficking but in reality you're making it easier to traffic human beings:
