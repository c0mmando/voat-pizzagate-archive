<p>It was after I started posting here and linking to our BBS\'s work on Pizza Motif.</p>
<p>The same user, City,  who didn\'t like Lemonhead was the one who sussed out something going on in St. Louis around Pizza themes. We had no idea what it was about but tracked it from Dec. 2015 [ all the Media references, past references, pages and pages ] but not until I saw the Reddit discussion of Podesta and his emails did it all come clear. </p>
<p>I had already given up eating Pizza because of all the creepiness we tagged around it. I knew it was being pushed, but I didn\'t know why. </p>
<p>So as soon as I started linking over here to our work, in a frenzy, many hours a day. BOOM Mr. Lemon comes with the saccharine Christian message saying we should repent.. How ironic.  
</p>
<p>Mr. Lemonhead, who broke and defaced the Forum wrote me this letter today. [see below]</p>
<p>Such a liar. Firstly, he doesn\'t own the site / domain; Secondly he has no claim on anyone else\'s writing there. How can he sue me? - He doesn\'t even have his name on the Forum nor on any of his writing there - He owns no Trademark? What is that? He never got anyone\'s permissions / consent for claiming he owned our writings. How could he? He is not even the registrant? -</p>
<p>His writing on there? </p>
<p>He basically abandoned after he was punked by the 2012 scam - It was his rule that nothing should be changed or erased; otherwise all he had to do is erase his stuff.</p>
<p>He lied about claiming he would send me the &quot;Pizzagate&quot; material since the return on this email he sent me was a dead server. Wow.
Brain damaged by too much &quot;Ayahuaska&quot; &amp; Claims I\'m the &quot;New Ager&quot;/ Whaaaat? </p>
<p>Here\'s Lemonhead: :</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Here’s what’s going to happen.
I’m taking the forum down for ever.
The admin area will be accessible by me only.
I will not accept any attempts to restore the forum database on any other domains, because legally I own the copyright to the material I have written and I don’t want you to infringe on my copyright. Are you going to respect that decision? I don’t wanna see a word of my writings online ever again. My wish is that you just let the past go. If you don’t respect my will I have to take the legal route, hire a lawyer and I will sue your for copyright infringement under 17 U.S.C. 504, the consequences of copyright infringement include statutory damages of between $750 and $30,000 per work, at the discretion of the court, and damages of up to $150,000 per work for willful infringement. If you continue to engage in copyright infringement after receiving this letter, your actions will be evidence of “willful infringement.”
I’m sure you’re thinking this has to do with your pizzagate “research” but it has nothing to do with that. I’ll prove that by sending you the info you want from the pizza thread, I can screenshot it all + copy the raw text so that you have it in visual and text form with links. Looks like the attachments are gone tough but I’m sure you can find the images elsewhere since this means a lot to you. If I can fix the attachments I’ll do that before sending you the thread. In exchange for the information I wish that you promise to never ever again mention my name in public or private conversation. I have taken great care to protect my reputation since I quit the forum, the actions of the past has been forgotten in the real world. I have found new friends, created a new life, the last thing I want is to see my name associated with the forum online.
Every page of the thread in question I’ll send you, but after that I want NOTHING to do with this forum or anyone of you people that are still stuck in that paradigm. It’s taken up enough valuable and productive time of my life. It’s dead from today. If you wanna waste your life on a struggle that is only wasting your precious time left on Earth, you’re welcome. But the original synch forum is dead.
You see, any form of activism is complete utter bullshit, Christ will save those that repent from their sins and you cannot stop God’s will, and God has already allowed for the Antichrist to come to power, so it has been written and it will happen because God doesn’t lie. It is being done for our salvation and believing we can stop this (the ascension, awakening new age BS bla bla bla) is the highest form of vanity, declaring yourselves higher then Gods will… You are the lunatic fringe nothing more. You have no power, and no importance to anyone but yourselves. I don’t know if you noticed that there are many mentally ill people on the forum? I’m sure you have the next Mark Chapman lurking somewhere in the muddy waters of the synch forum. Everyone that’s not involved directly consider you to be crazy, exactly what the Devil wanted for you and you fell for his deception, as did I. I deeply regret everything I’ve ever written on the forum except for the very last 
posts, where I started seeing the new age deception for what it was! I could imagine myself starting a new blog and writing only about the new age deception in the future. But from what I’ve seen so far you guys just ignored everything I wrote and are are continuing to “follow the white rabbit”, “entering the stargate”, and all those other evil traps you’re <em>expected</em> to follow in your path of self-destruction.
Nothing is gonna happen with pizzagate, you can’t challenge these people because it’s not meant for them to fall… You believe in fairy-tales, stop wasting your life. What happened to the Franklin cover-up? Same thing is going to happen with this, NOTHING… You’re never gonna defeat the Antichrist, only Christ can do that and he will. But if you’re not on his team, you’re gonna be out of luck. You’re being extremely paranoid, you believe people are out to get you when the truth is nobody cares about what you’re doing. NWO is coming no doubt about it, but only in Christ there will be protection and stop thinking you can stop the inevitable, my recommendation is to enjoy mundane life until the time comes, ignore the paranoia and trust in God. I pretty sure the message is not being received but that’s all I have to say…&quot;</p>

            Pizza Connections go all the way back to the "Pizza Connection" trials which were prosecuted by Louis Freeh in the 80's. In Palermo there were so many Gangsters on trial [and also gov officials implicated] that a special arena had to be built for the trials, with private guards since the police and military could not be trusted.
