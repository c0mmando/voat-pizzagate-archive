            the logical explanation is that anyone that calls "pizzagate" by name and knows about it, and still denies it and calls it "discredited", is absolutely 100% involved in pizzagate as an individual , and their drawers are brimming over!!

             Thats a little naive.
            </p>
            <p>
             I could have heard about it and read only the first few articles i mentioned which said basically pizzagate debunked and then i would not be "involved" simply because i didnt do my due diligence. Just means im ignorant.
            </p>
            <p>
             Also doesnt help when its described by many as HRC running children out of a pizza parlor. Idc who you are, in context, that sounds ridiculous.

            Oh and I highly recommend if you want DiFranco to have a chance of seeing it posted on defranco's subreddit he's actually pretty good about looking at that or at least one of his crew does and if enough attention gets to a post he'll respond

            I had never heard of pizzagate so you can think defranco for at least getting the word out.
           </p>
           <p>
            When i  googled it the first few things i read basically said it was debunked and guaranteed to be fake.
Im a curious one, so i thought....how do you prove a theory is definitely fake....you cant...
           </p>
           <p>
            Which made me more curious. So read the pg wiki and the original emails. Then found my way here.
           </p>
           <p>
            It certainly smells fishy. There is without a doubt something like this going on. Thats a fact.
Cant say if the right places / people mentioned i. The pizzagate theory but its definitely happening.
           </p>
           <p>
            And the theory also has some seriously good points.
           </p>
           <p>
            Imo phil might even believe it himself but realizes hed be blacklisted by a huge % of people if he even suggested it held water.
           </p>
           <p>
            Thats the problem with people like alex jones supporting the story. Gets placed in with beliefs like sex rings on mars....which is to put it simply...retarded...and you get lumped in with crazy.
           </p>
           <p>
            Its a fact, some sick and twisted people are doing sick and twisted things to our children and getting away with it.
           </p>
           <p>
            Part of me wonders if they dont push the ridiculous  theories so when a real one like this comes out it gets buried in the muck

             That's a great way to get here, you found yourself here by taking with the mainstream barrative, a grain of salt, I wish more people were like that. Because when you look at the Idaho Amber alerts ie. Alertsense the usa main interoperable emergency alwrt systems situation, with convicted kidnapper Silsby at work as vice prrsident!!!! Wtf? Pizzagate is real bruh, oh, can anyone explain the lack of outrage??? Black lives matter?? To whom?? Blood thirsty organ harvesters and that's all folks! Like the comment below says welcome to he'll om earth, because people are doing some wrong to children with 800 thousand the national number of missing per year and people wanna argue about that number cause no body fucking even knows how many go missing in the usa, bottom line, and as far as the NAMBLA discussion goes, its the same as heart progress, the pedo activists, except heart progress actually connotates all the surgical transplant tolerance associations, having the same jargon is not coinkydink. So as far as NAMBLA HARRY HAY &amp; legislations that have passed,  is I'd rather not protest, OR BE CALLED A NAMBLA PEOTESTER, because it does not include the scope of atrocities I wanna include, like the harvesting of cord blood and hearts of children.  I'd rather just shut it down. From the inside, which to me is the official way, becausemost people kinda get it thats why nambla are so creepy. But no one figures Nambla is heart progress who are at ALERTSENSE. The ALERTSENSE ROUTE, is a mainstream agency, no one thinks they harbor kidnappers, whereas nambla is suspect already.  start there. If I went after every Nambla guy around here, i coukd just talk to any one of the many gay guys around the bay area and get into a stupid long argument about the age of consent. Fuck that, pedophiles/slaverers, have got to be taken OUT OF POWER NO MATTER WHAT NAME ORGANIZATION RANK TITTLE CLERGY FOSTER HOME NATIONAL DATABASE FOR EMERGENCIES ETC... these people have gadgets we have KIDS.

             "Pizzagate" is not fake and I can prove it right now: James Alefantis of Comet Ping Pong and his boyfriend David Brock, the head of Media Matter for America, are connected to the
             <em>
              convicted
             </em>
             child trafficker Laura Silsby, who was jailed for abducting 33 children from a Haitian orphanage, through the lawyer Max Maccoby who handled Alefantis' and Brocks' $850,000 blackmail case (gee, I wonder what that was about?). Max Maccoby sits on the board of directors of an orphanage called "Friends of the Orphans".
            </p>
            <p>
             According to an interview with Laura Silsbys own Lawyer, Jorge Puello, who was himself wanted by Interpol for sex trafficking crimes and was later caught and convicted, the orphanage that Silsby was caught stealing children from was called "Friends of the Orphans of Haiti".
            </p>
            <p>
             Hillary Clinton has inserted herself into the Silsby/Alefantis/Maccoby triangle in at least two separate ways. First, Wikileaks shows her campaign has done fundraisers at Comet Ping Pong; second, while Secretary of State, Clinton personally intervened to get Laura Silsby out of Haitian Prison after she was convicted.
            </p>
            <p>
             This constitutes proof beyond a reasonable doubt that elite human trafficking rings exist which serve (and likely blackmail) politicians, wealthy businessmen and other influential people.﻿

              I actually remember when that lady gt arrested for the haiti child trafficking.
             </p>
             <p>
              If i remember correctly, she was lauded over by msm like she was a saint, like she was saving these kids.
And tbh i took that as truth or at least partial truth. Seems plausible she was.doing it for the right reasons even if the kids were later meant for nefarious purposes.
             </p>
             <p>
              I mean, if you were in charge of something like this, wouldnt you want to find a fool who thought she was helping rather than someone who could implicate you and the purposes these children were actually intended?
             </p>
             <p>
              Seems likely to me anyway

             Welcome to hell. Or at least hell on a back-burner. You should have been here when we were still unraveling all the facts. It was like watching ten thousand people slowly receive psychological damage over a period of three or so months. I have this weird horrific nostalgia about that time, I felt like I lived in a vacuum carrying all this shit around in my head all day while everyone else went about their lives.
            </p>
            <p>
             Ya know, what really drove the "theory" home for me was the reaction. After a few weeks of pizzagate being a thing, there was over the course of 24 hours a decentralized "official" reaction to the theory's existence, like an immune system kicking into gear:
            </p>
            <p>
             • the pizzagate subreddit
             <a href="https://np.reddit.com/v/Pizzagate">
              /v/Pizzagate
             </a>
             was banned from reddit, admins cited witchhunting/doxxing yet we never posted any personal information that wasn't public
            </p>
            <p>
             • several hit-pieces on the community/theory were put out by, if I recall correctly, Washington Post, NYT, and maybe CNN. It was about three MSM outlets at least. (Let me note here that after
             <a href="http://https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jimmy_Savile">
              Jimmy Saville's death and outing
             </a>
             the BBC editor who was complicit in the coverup of Saville's crimes at the BBC left the BBC...and moved to NYT...who released an article in 2013-ish claiming that pedophilia isn't a crime or some shit)
            </p>
            <p>
             Edit: Now I remember. It was Snopes, not CNN.
            </p>
            <p>
             • Pizzagate videos began to be removed from YouTube; this has never stopped since then.
            </p>
            <p>
             • The Wikipedia entry was written and addressed almost none of the main PG talking points and also claimed that it was "debunked", yet the Moon Landing hoax and others aren't listed as debunked
            </p>
            <p>
             All of those hit-pieces ignored the fucking point of PG and just pigeonholed it as "Right wing conspiracy theory that Hillary Clinton runs a pedophile ring out of a pizza parlor" which is fucking ridiculous enough to ward off anybody from further investigation.
            </p>
            <p>
             That is what convinced me that this was for real. The reaction to it. For if it weren't true, why the lies? Why the censorship? Why the urgency to it all? And on top of that there's all the, you know, actual body and evidence to the theory.
            </p>
            <p>
             That is what convinced me.
            </p>
            <p>
             And then it all just kept getting worse.
            </p>
            <p>
             Whatever.

             <p>
              Youtube and others would cite slander as their reason for removal which is total nonsense saying every theory slanders someone.
Ie if we really did go to the moon those theories are pretty darned slanderous to Buzz and crew. Yet they remain.

              You hit my feelings on this to a T. Feeling like I was dying on the inside and people were just going about their business without a care in the world.
             </p>
             <p>
              I also agree that the CONTEXT CLUES are what gives this investigation its solidarity.  The historic evidence in Hollywood, the Franklin Scandal, Jimmy Savile, MKultra, the Finders Cult, etc. coupled with the immense censorship and blatant lies were a major tell that the deep state had no idea this leak would mean so much to their inevitable demise. So much so they created an entire Russian narrative to cover it up. Now we are at odds with Russia despite DTs attempts on improving relations. Thats how badly rhe deeo state wants this to go away. And they think allowing the round up of the small time fish with no prosecutions of anyone in the upper echelon will help stamp out the fire. Such bullshit.

             I don't believe for a minute that he'd never heard of pizzagate. He's a YouTuber with a massive following. He owns all about it. It's just in his best interest to steer clear from it because it polarizes his base. That fucks with his money. He knows. Hahah never heard of it my ass.

            l was literally just compiling information to post in a comment and l stumbled through a Google search here, can someone please give me a link to something that l can post there... a compilation done either here or as a YouTube video. There's this trilogy: youtube.com/watch?v=fzT1l7B_ZKE youtube.com/watch?v=sQ82gD8VYIo and youtube.com/watch?v=uz4GT8F3Jso but it may be waaaay to long for someone blue-pilled that will find any excuse to say l'm crazy and l don't even know if it's a good trilogy anyway. l have a few podesta e-mails (l found this hankerchief... lol) written on the comment l'm going to post, but any resources you might give me l'm happy to add (literally just made the account to comment this) :D (my DeFranco comment will wound up having been seen by nobody anyway, darnnit, but l will post it anyway)

            I hit his Facebook but I don't think it did much. It sucks, I like Phil a lot as a general news source and it sucks even worse he just glossed over a subject like this.

            Yeah, those of you that have YT accounts please get in there because there are only a few about pizzagate.  And right now it is about 50/50.  They do cover Antifa and BLM which is very surprising so some are awake, but not fully.  WAKE them up.
