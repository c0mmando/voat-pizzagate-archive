Please do NOT SPREAD disinformation about President Trump being a pedophile. I am a member of Association of Certified Fraud Examiners. I have yet to see any evidence of President Trump having gone on that airplane (or any airplane) to the US Virgin Islands - estate of convicted pedophile Jeffrey Epstein.</p>
<p>If anything, Trump saw suspicious activity in Epstein\'s circles that include ALAN DERSHOWITZ who helped to negotiate a non-prosecutorial agreement such that female victims of Epstein\'s trafficking (lured through &quot;teenage modeling&quot;) would not be able to sue Epstein. NOW this can be overturned with the help of our new Attorney General Jeffrey Sessions. I for one am looking forward to working with an AG who is TOUGH on pedophiles (versus Holder and Jarrett, both of whom turned blind eyes on Gilgo and other cases).</p>
<p>I did the original research three months ago re: the lawsuit filed against President Trump by a woman who alleges that she was 13 and raped by him on East 71st Street. We found that convicted murderer TIFFANY MOSER (convicted of vehicular homicide and involved in an East Coast money laundering ring) pretended to be &quot;Katie Johnson&quot;, wearing a wig for an interview which may still be on YouTube.</p>
<p>We then traced the lawsuit allegedly filed in NY County with the court appearance Dec 2016 and found the evidence of drug addict NORMAN LUBOW having filed that fraudulent lawsuit. LUBOW had been a producer on the Jerry Springer show and helped to rile up people to get into fights. He\'s the lowest of the low and uses the alias &quot;Al Taylor&quot;. For the NY lawsuit, he illegally used the address of a foreclosed home in CA and also used the name of deceased White Plains NY Lawyer in whose name a law firm was named. (Use of both sets of data can be prosecuted as identity theft.) I called the law firm office on a Saturday to inform them and the woman who answered was very grateful.</p>
<p>President Trump is NOT a pedophile. I have been working with a group from military intel and they briefed his campaign staff about the intense research done on the Gilgo NY - NJ Serial killings and the pedophile rings in TX (see Amy Charron, protective mother - daughter Markel) as well as Maine (see Dr Lauri Handrahan, protective mother, daughter Mila Malenko). Senator Schumer also knows about my work on Gilgo (proven links to child trafficking). Yes, this pedophile ring is extensive and a lot of the $95 billion child porn content is on the Dark Web / Deep Web.</p>
<p>I met two of the amazing people who infiltrated J20 domestic terrorists (not peaceful protestors&quot;, but criminals) and one of the J20 members is an alleged pedophile. Separate investigation of that as well. FBI and ICE can handle the investigation of his internet activity. They will do a stellar job, I am sure.</p>
<p>Pedophiles are MONSTERS and there is no cure. They all belong in Federal jail for life, with NO internet access.</p>',

            How so?? About a million kids go missing per year in the US now. If only 3% are with pedos, that's 30,000 NEW kids per year potentially being used for child porn purposes. If each of these 30k brings one new photo sale per year, that's $600,000 at $20 per photo sale. I have no idea the going rate for child pornography, but considering that's a blind estimate and child trafficking is worldwide.
