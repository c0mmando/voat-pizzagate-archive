           he is one of them. In every way, shape and form, Donald Trump is part of the NWO. They have gone to great lengths to sell the phony Trump vs Deep state war. It is not real. He was likely selected long ago to enact the next phase of the transition to the New World Order. First they need major events and crisis, then conflict, then their solution. Trump is their Trump card.

             The public is practically unaware of the overwhelming responsibility carried by the Vatican and its Jesuits in the start of the two world wars—a situation which may be explained in part by the gigantic finances at the disposition of the Vatican and its Jesuits, giving them power in so many spheres, especially since the last conflict.
            </p>

             In fact, the part they took in those tragic events has hardly been mentioned until the present time, except by apologists eager to disguise it. It is with the aim of rectifying this and establishing the true facts that we present in this and other books the political activity of the Vatican during the contemporary epoch—activity which mutually concerns the Jesuits.

             This study is based on irrefutable archive documents, publications from well-known political personalities, diplomats, ambassadors and eminent writers, most of whom are Catholics, even attested by the imprimatur.
            </p>
            <hr/>
            <p>
             These documents bring to light the secret actions of the Vatican and its perfidious actions in creating conflicts between nations when it served its interests. With the help of conclusive articles, we show the part played by the "church" in the rise of totalitarian regimes in Europe.
            </p>
            <hr/>
            <p>
             These testimonies and documents constitute a crushing indictment and, so far, no apologist has tried to disprove them.

             The main difficulty of my subject, as will be readily understood, lies in "discovering and delineating the true character of the Jesuits : for, take the Jesuit for -what he ought or appears to be, and you commit the greatest of blunders. Draw the character after what 
the Jesuit seems to be in London, and you will not recognise your portrait in the Jesuit of Rome. The Jesuit is the man of circumstances.

             Despotic in Spain, constitutional in England, republican in Paraguay, bigot in Rome, idolater in India, he shall assume and act out in his own person, with admirable flexibility, all those different features by which men are usually to be distinguished from each other. He will accom- pany the gay woman of the world to the theatre, and will share in the excesses of the debauchee.

             With solemn countenance, he will take his place by the side of the religious man at church, and he will revel in the tavern with the glutton and the sot. He dresses, in all garbs, speaks all languages, knows all customs, is present everywhere though nowhere recognised — and all this, it should seem (O monstrous blasphemy!), for the greater glory of God — ad majorem Dei gloriam.

            In regards to Jesuits and their "medical care" of the children of India:
           </p>
           <hr/>
           <p>
            The German Steinmetz, alluding to this, says:
            <strong>
             "They insinuate themselves as physicians into the houses of the Indians; draw a wet cloth over the head and forehead of the sick person,
            </strong>
           </p>
           <p>
            2 Steinmetz, Vol. Ill, p. 474. Citing.the Jesuit Fathers De Bourges and Martin. 3 Ibid., p. 489.
           </p>
           <p>
            <strong>
             even when at the point of death; mutter privately to themselves the baptism service; and think they have made one Christian more, who is immediately added to the list."
            </strong>
            The Jesuit De Bourges is represented by him as saying:
            <strong>
             "When the children are in danger of death, our practice is to baptize them without asking the permission of their parents, which would certainly be refused.
            </strong>
           </p>
           <hr/>
           <p>
            <strong>
             The Catechists and the private Christians are well acquainted with the formula of baptism, and they confer it on these dying children, under the pretext of giving them medicine ;" that is, by that kind of "pious fraud" which, according to the Jesuits, promotes "the greater glory of God."
            </strong>
            Another Jesuit father, whose experience in India enabled him to speak advisedly, mentions one woman " whose knowledge of the pulse and of the symptoms of approaching death was so unerring, that of more than ten thousand children whom she had herself baptized, not more than two escaped death."
           </p>
           <hr/>
           <p>
            The number of such baptisms during a famine in 1737 are alleged by still another Jesuit to have been " upwards of 12,000." And he supplements this statement by saying that "it was rare, in any place where there were neophytes, for a single heathen child to die unbaptized." Looking over this whole field of Jesuit operations, and contemplating the demoralizing influences of the Jesuits in India, this same German historian feels himself warranted in saying that "every Jesuit who entered within these unholy bounds, bid adieu to principle and truth—all became perjured impostors, and the lives of all ever afterwards were but one long, persevering, toilsome LIE.

             What a singular commentary on the in-difference, the subserviency, or the cowardice of society, that an institution, professedly organized by such cunning knaves, [the Jesuits] and for such base purposes, and which has been sustained by fraud, falsehood and deception, from the commencement of its career to the present time, should be permitted to day to dictate to, if not virtually to rule the nation, and to create such a dread in communities that even some of the ministers of Christian de- 
nominations who detest its vile philosophy, and who would like to see it swept from the face of the earth, are absolutely afraid to mention its name, either in the pulpit, the prayer meeting or the Sabbath school, lest its secret vendetta vengeance might, in some concealed manner, be wreaked upon them.

             Jesuitism inspired its followers with a fanaticism.....There was no crime 
too great for them to commit, no deception too base for them to practise, 
no disguise too difficult for them to assume. It was a 
fundamental principle of the order that the end justifies the means. By this 
code, lying, theft, peijury, assassination, were not only pardonable but 
commendable, when they served the interests of the church. Under 
various disguises the Jesuits worked their way into offices of state, 
climbing up to be the counselors of kings, and shaping the policy of 
nations.

            Due to the severe backlash about studying jesuits it made me curious. So I studied and what if find is far nastier than anything I imagined.

He occupies the place of God, and must be obeyed, howsoever the peace and welfare of the multitude may be imperiled, or the nations be convulsed from center to circumference. The society of Jesuits must obtain the mastery, even if general anarchy shall prevail, or all the world besides be covered with the fragments of a universal wreck!

            The Catholic church is proven, practically every week by a new priest busted for pedophilia, that the Catholic Church is full of pedophiles. It is very "cherry picking" selective to ignore the Jesuit role in pedophilia. This sub protects Catholic pedophiles because Trump has a Jesuit background. Everytime someone posts the documentary of survivors who were raped and tortured by the Catholic Church when they were children it gets immediately and swiftly deleted. Interesting how that is not relevant to pizzagate innit?

            You should seek mental health help.
Do you really believe the retarded drivel that you spewed here?
Or are you another in the long line of idiots, who just spout off insane bullshit for attention?
The only storm will be when our POTUS finally gives the order to proceed against all of the traitorous &amp; slimy cocksuckers who are trying to bring down our country.
But their main goal, is to stop POTUS from proceeding, cuz they know they WILL be arrested and outed for their crimes.
All of the commies, nazis, progressives, pisslamists, &amp; pedophiles are shaking in fear that their crimes will be outed for the world to see.
We the People WILL MAGA.
And We the People WILL make sure that this kind of evil will NEVER gain a foothold in America ever again.
Gorge Soros WILL fall, and his minions will rot away, and fall into the trash bin of history.

            Thank you for this post.
           </p>
           <p>
            What I see happening is a polarising of opposites. When that happens people cannot open their eyes to the truth.  I see Trump-ers attacking only Democrat sex offenders, but championing anyone on the Right who has an allegation made against him.  I see Democrat supporters continuously repeat that Trump is a sex offender, but they can't clean up their own backyards because they refuse to admit the Left also has a problem.
           </p>
           <p>
            This pedophilia issue straddles both side of politics.  It's not only Left men who abuse children.  There is NO way Trump would have made it to the White House without the support of some Satanist pedophiles. Absolutely no way.   I am not saying that Trump is a pedo (in fact, I don't think he is). But I am saying that he's not going to go after the pedophiles because some of the people who got him to where he is now are pedophiles.  If he were to go after all the pedos, many Republicans would fall.  He can't afford to do that.
           </p>
           <p>
            The fact that you have many more downvotes than upvotes shows how polarising this issue is.  Most people here cannot countenance the fact that Trump might be protecting the pedos because his political life depends on it.   Unfortunately, I don't think Trump is our saviour.  All we can hope for is that a light is shone on these cockroaches in the dark so that ordinary people decide their justice.

            Trump may not be perfect but he is the best we've got. Sure certain Jewish groups helped put him in power and for now our interests align. If anyone is expecting a Mother Therasa moment in all this they better look elsewhere.

             Check this out. Some of these people rooting for Trump are Jewish Supremecists because they know Trump is pro israel. Trump supporters need to let that sink in.

            This fucker is making up falsehoods to lead people to believe that Jews were always there and are being kicked out. That is a lie.

             How old is the Temple in Jerusalem? The first one. A thousand years before Christ. That'd be 1,600 years before Islam was even INVENTED. And somehow, the Muslims MUST have that 1 little scrap of land that the Jews built their first Temple on? Small world, I guess....What a coincidence!
            </p>
            <p>
             The ONLY reason the Islam scum act like Jerusalem is important to them is they like to construct their mosques atop the religious centers of what they think are their "vanquished" enemies. Like when they attempted to build a mosque @ the World Trade Center. Plus they hate Israel, so the Arab Muslims want the constant state of war ....That tiny piece of land is Israel's, the Arab Muslims have territory all around it that is many hundreds of times as large. And the Arabs that live there are almost all Jordanian. There IS no Palestinian people.

                First of all, its not your business to decide whether or not I think another poster is right or wrong, full of shit, a liar, or anything else.

                Second of all, if you were worried about "venom spewing" there is a resident donkey that would have been gone long ago.

               <hr/>
               <p>
                Third, I don't consider your "bead that could have been a necklace" any sort of scientific evidence. I do consider thousands of years of culture and buildings of the people that have been living there evidence of their existence for thousands of years before the Balfour declaration was cooked up.
               </p>
               <hr/>
               <p>
                Fourth, I don't consider that poster's opinion "carefully researched and written sourced information" because its not. Its his opinion and I don't have to agree with it.

                The rich multi generational heritage of "the jews" in Palestine is a bead as big as thimble, buried among the ruins of THOUSANDS OF YEARS of buildings and irrefutable proof of the people that have obviously been living there and have true right to be there. Dude, you would have been better off with that one....

                You have no right to bother me and accuse me of "shitting up well researched written and sourced information" because I don't agree with another poster's unscientific opinion.

                You can do whatever you want. Its complete bullshit. Those people lived over there peacefully before the British concocted the Balfour declaration and then started bombing them out of their homes in the 1940's. So yes, its all bullshit and "Israel" has no right to be there. End of story.

                     <p>
                      In the opinion article published Tuesday, the author claims that only through nuclear annihilation of Iran and Germany, with 20 or 30 nuclear bombs each, can Israelis prevent the state’s destruction.

                      “If Israel does not walk in the ways of God’s Bible,” author Chen Ben-Eliyahu wrote in Hebrew, “it will receive a heavy punishment of near complete destruction and doom and only a few will be saved.”

                    German extraction, and Baptist, genius.  The obsessive and illogical Jew-hate simply offends my sense of fairness.  I can put Jews on that spot 3,000 years ago.  PLUS they have nowhere else to go.  The Jordanian "Palestinians" sit amid a land mass that is hundreds of times larger than Israel, surrounded by hundreds of times as many allied Muslims.
But the postage stamp Israel needs to survive?  "Too much",  Arab goat-fuckers must be catered to.....BTW, ARAB MUSLIMS have been fucking us way worse than Israel.

            Christian Zionism is a trick on real Christians that want to follow the true peaceful teachings of Jesus. Zionists are anti Christian. Zionist are trying to convert Christianity into a sheep herd of Zionist followers. Zionism is the religion of war and domination.

             <strong>
              Kushner Foundation Gives $342K to Chabad — Still Surprised About Jared and Ivanka’s Synagogue?
             </strong>
            </p>
            <p>
             It might seem odd for a Modern Orthodox Jewish family to join a Chabad synagogue. But Ivanka Trump and her husband Jared Kushner are already quite invested in the ultra-Orthodox outreach movement – or to be more precise, their parents are.
            </p>
            <p>
             A Haaretz examination has revealed that Charles and Seryl Kushner have been major benefactors of Chabad over the years. Between 2003 and 2013, their family foundation donated a total of $342,500 to various institutions and projects associated with the movement, their tax records show.
            </p>
            <p>
             Chabad has benefited not only from Kushner’s side of the family. It turns out that President-elect Donald Trump has also contributed to the movement – even before his daughter, who converted to Judaism, was married. Altogether, the Donald J. Trump Foundation has donated $11,550 to three Chabad institutions.

              Jared Kushner’s college rabbi recalls a snow-shoveling student mega-donor
             </strong>
            </p>
            <p>
             When at Harvard, Trump’s son-in-law and senior adviser attended services and Shabbat dinner at Chabad house, performed workaday tasks, gave generously, and was 'like a part of the family' for Rabbi Hirschy Zarchi
            </p>
            <hr/>
            <p>
             Jared Kushner was already a regular at the Harvard Chabad when he walked in one day, took a crumpled piece of paper out of his jacket pocket, put it down on the table and walked away.
            </p>
            <p>
             It was a personal check for $18,000.
            </p>
            <hr/>
            <p>
             “’I have some deals that really went well, so I want to give something back to Chabad,’” Harvard Chabad Rabbi Hirschy Zarchi recalls Kushner, then a sophomore or junior, saying. Zarchi calls it “one of the largest checks we ever received, not just from a student, but even from a parent.”
            </p>
            <hr/>
            <p>
             Kushner, now son-in-law and senior adviser to President Donald Trump, established a constant, outsize presence at the Harvard Chabad during his time as a student there, Zarchi and other students recall. Beyond the surprise donation, Kushner attended prayers and Shabbat dinner regularly, recruited students to Chabad’s programs, performed workaday tasks for the house and served as the emcee when Chabad dedicated a new building in 2003.
            </p>
            <hr/>
            <p>
             On a personal level, Kushner was a “like a part of the family” to Zarchi and his wife, Elkie, the rabbi says. From his earliest days at Harvard through his senior year, Kushner attended the Zarchi children’s birthday parties, sent flowers to the family and received chicken soup from Elkie Zarchi at his dorm when he came down with the flu.

              link to yt video of the guy Ryan  claiming JA threatened him!
             </p>
             <p>
              remember that! Now I dont know what the consensus was here at Voat regarding the validity of the claim but if true  I was just referencing the part at the end of the video were JA in a tongue in cheek way says "keep your VOAT profile"
 Now the context or the intent of statements is hard to discern in those text, so it could mean anything but it was strange to me that he wanted all vids and threads deleted but then says to keep using VOAT which is where most PG digging is done on the web

            I think this is the best 31 minutes a person can spend in order to understand what we see happening in the world right now. No matter who won the election, Trump or Hillary, THEY still win because we are not in their club.

                How does your response address or contradict anything I said? Why do you keep posting responses that lack clear logical connection to what they otherwise present themselves as refutations of? It is strangely like disruptive propaganda tactics. I am just saying.

              So an intelligence organization formed the same year as Mossad simply pays off the MSM which is COMPLETELY JEWISH-OWNED AND OPERATED SINCE BEFORE THE WAR.  But Jews aren't behind it, perish the thought!   LOL!

              Who started Mockingbird? The Jew Bill Paley of CBS.  Who has run the WaPo since 1933? The Jewish Graham family.  But apparently unless theyre named Seth Bernsteinkike you couldn't spot one if he was sacrificing your child to Moloch before your eyes.

             The anti Trump media frenzy is intended to show that he is not one of them and is their enemy. Anything he does must be good, like the newest executive order he just did.

               It is not plausable that they allowed somebody on the ballot that is not their asset. It is not plausable that they allowed somebody to the debates that is not their asset. It is not plausable that he was one of them his entire privldged life, but once he became potus, he doesn't want to play the power game anymore and wants to fight for the little people. It isn't plausbable that he has been a secret society rich entitled brat his entire life, now he wants to take them down. This is theater. You MUST belive he is fighting them, or their next move wont work.

                It's not plausible that they would necessarily have ABSOLUTE control over anything. It is not plausible that they would always control every ballot, or even most (necessarily, we don't know). You have no solid basis for claiming he was "one of them", beyond the cherry picking, as we've seen. The fact that you are using insulting epithets in lieu of reasoning further diminishes the impression that you have a single valid thought here. Are you okay?
               </p>
               <p>
                You can certainly paint a picture that fits the conclusion you wish to draw, but you take it much further with this overwrought and unreasonable rhetoric. It happens to be a fact that there is huge volume of propaganda in the MSM that does this same thing. It might be entirely coincidental that your unbiased and sensitive investigation into child trafficking has led you to the same anti-Trumpism that the pedo-trafficking-covering-up MSM also promotes. It could be, I don't know. But you certainly have no case for your urgent anti-Trumpism as being good for anti-trafficking hopes, and I don't think anyone with any big-picture awareness would find you credible in that connection whatsoever.

             I'm non-partisan, I agree that of course there is a lot of anti-Trump propaganda by ShareBlue and the likes, but I'd appreciate it if people could take a step back and see issues from a distance.

             I once was an ardent HRC supporter

             , so I know how great it feels to have a 'hero' and utterly believe that she/he will be The White Knight.

            <p>
             And I do respect the Trump supporters here, they are doing great work, although I agree to disagree with them to a certain extent.

              But the thing is, there is every appearance of a fairly unified cabal of players on top, that never expected Trump to win. Thus, on the level of actual global power, there is 1) them, 2) Trump, 3) jack shit. As far as I know. That, to me, is reality. So I am not weighing every item of Trump's being to decide if he passes some stringent test. This is a war, and it is extremely serious. If Trump loses, there is nothing but the stranglehold of the cabal.

              A lot of us are anti-New World Order.  We were hoping that Trump would be useful in this regard.  I have seen no connection between Trump and the Bilderberg Group or Council on Foreign Relations, but I am still trying to get through the posts in this thread.  Maybe someone found some connections I am not aware of.
             </p>
             <p>
              My understanding is that there are two factions.  If Hillary would have won, then the U.S. would have had an influx of immigrants from African and the Middle East, just like what is happening in Europe.   The U.S. would have been destroyed.
             </p>
             <p>
              Instead, Trump won, and I am hoping it means that a certain faction wants to rebuild the U.S.
             </p>
             <p>
              As others have pointed out before, we won't know for sure that Trump is real until we start seeing the big players go down.  Soros, the Rothschilds, Jesuits, Vatican, the Federal Reserve, etc.  If only the minor players are going down, then we are being played.
             </p>
             <p>
              The question I have is how long do we wait for something to happen?  I mean, at a certain point, we have to decide that nothing is going to change, and then move forward to make the changes that need to be made.

               All this investigation and spreading info about pedophilia needs patience. Think decades, not one or two years. As others have been pointing out, Trump is not out last hope, we are.

               Re MAGA - the tax reform will be good for the economy in the next couple of years, but it will increase debt. Sacking TTP was a good thing.
Controlling immigration, if done properly, is a good thing too. It remains to be seen what Trump will have achieved after 4 years in office.

               Unfortunately, he doesn't have experience in politics, so his leadership isn't as strong as it could be. He's not savy re the political routine stuff his predecessors handled with ease. This makes him act clumsily and less successful.

              You don't have to blush.  All of us have fallen one time or another.  I fell for the Hopium, so there is that.  I totally get now how it happened.  I also will never ever believe in a White Knight again. Although mine was not completely White for the record.  No more Saviors.  We are the person we have been waiting for.

               Don't see 'Deep State' as a unilateral union. Same applies to 'Illuminati' (I don't like the term, but can't think of a better one at the moment).
              </p>
              <p>
               Look at mob structures - there are always factions fighting each other, struggling to gain more power, sometimes they cooperate nevertheless...new players and new partners will turn up from time to time - it's more like an entangled web than a unilateral block.
              </p>
              <p>
               Think about the power struggle at the Vatican, which resulted in axing Benedict XVI.

            Super lame when people post a photograph of a meet-and-greet to prove a deep connection.

           <p>
            It's also super convenient that everyone uses "Zionist" and "Mossad" but never "Jew."  Like Israel isn't a state colonized FOR AND BY ETHNIC JEWS.  Not even religious Jews let alone occultist Jews.  Ethnic Jews.  Who debunks PG? Jews in Jewish-controlled media outlets.  Who controls Hollywood top to bottom? Jews.  Who dominate higher education in wildly disproportionate numbers?  Jews.  Who are the top political donors to both parties? Jews.  Where do most Jewish charity dollars go?  Directly to Israel.  Who do we fight wars for despite zero American interests there? Israel.

            You all have internalized your own oppression and as a white man it shames me deeply.

             Meet and greet? Epsetein is a freind and partner in crime. Rothschild is a business associate.  Clitons are long time friends. Trump is a Jesuit. Address the evidence. He is directly involved in all of this. Nothing on this thread is a meet and greet. You seem to be struggling with the reality pointed out. And didn't you hate the Jooos? Had to throw that out the window didn't you. Gotta sell the psyop.

              I was against Trump before anyone:

             <p>
              100% because of his JEW connections. IDGAF if he's crypto-Jew Jesuit or just a greedy dickhead.  It is acknolwedged both that the first Jesuits were crypto Jews and masonry is a Jewish front ANYWAY.  And a picture is WEAK PROOF regardless of the proposition it forwards.  That was my point.
             </p>
             <p>
              Seriously why the temptation to be a faggot and say "aha! I spotted you with my Keen eye for 'shills'!"  It's gross.

                 That's a fact, not least of all cuz single mommed kids are a whopping 900% more likely to be abused since their IRRESPONSIBLE SLUT MOTHERS have a constant parade of strange men in their homes.  How is that hard to understand? Cuz it hurts your delicate sensibilities? GTFO the internet bitch.

            I find this thread highly dubious. I think anyone that observes events can clearly see Trump is our best hope. It is very easy to see that narratives to the contrary are calculated attempts to "blackpill", demoralize, and divide. There is VAST evidence of propaganda operations aimed at such demoralizing and dividing all over the internet. It world be absurd to think that propagandists would NOT try to infiltrate and demoralize an online community like this-- therefore, it is prima facie plausible that any thread that is congruent with anti-Trump propaganda originates from a common source as that with which it is congruent.

              It is important and necessary that any high-level power possible be enlisted in this fight. This hippy dippy style talk is NOT realistic if it is given as a reason NOT to seek connections to allies in places of real power.

               hippy talk ? it takes a brave human being to look themselves in the mirror and judge themselves in an honest way ...some cant ...its a tough thing to do.  Im speaking moreso to the newer people who are just joining this forum or for the first time looking into  conspiracy theories in a different light due to pizzagate!
              </p>
              <p>
               there is so much disinfo "noise" out in the public domain well, since forever. one must look at the facts, follow your own intuition and not get sucked up into the drama! it helps to talk to people you trust and love as well. Its alot to take in when you jump in the rabbit hole and sometimes you need to stop and clear the mind and soul. Theres nothinh wrong with that!
              </p>
              <p>
               And finally FFS we dont know if Trump...a 1%... is for the lil guy ...history has shown they (the 1%) have their own agenda . Now in that 1% you have all kinds of different cults or cliques whatever you want to call them, but they all seem to adhere to an esoteric secret knowledge that only they know! 
Hopefully their are people in their cult that are exposing that secret knowledge so humanity can have the positive advancement we all hunger for BUT the horrors and atrocities commited by them need to revealed or exposed as well so humanity can have an example of what we shouldnt allow ever again or to keep a better check upon it.Dont be decieved by a false prophet is all im saying i guess! beware ....

                Don't take the phrase to be an absolute judgement. There must be balance between personal and public elements-- in this case, there is already a huge well of people striving to do THEIR best.

               <p>
                You can keep repeating rhetoric about false prophets, and I don't disagree, but I have yet to see an argument that comes close to convincing me to not support Trump in every way possible, as all my instincts, observation, reasoning, and every other mode of awareness, tells me that it is the way to go. Again: it is either Trump wins and stops the cabal, or there is absolutely nothing standing between the cabal and absolute power.

             I find you dubious or incredibly naive. The swamp is not a self draining mechanism. The Neocon Zionist Republicans nor their fake opponents, the Hillary style Marxists Communists are the friend of the people.

             They may argue between themselves like gangsters at a poker table but they both hate the common people. The reason this sub can't have real and genuine threads and conversations is because this sub has been turned into an AIPAC Israeli Zionist Neocon ass kissing festival.

             Your best hope is not in Washington. You have to do it yourself. There is nothing "dubious" that I have pointed out. When Hillarys connections are pointed out, people register it. You guys refuse to use common sense when analyzing the reality of the situation. Trump is nor one of us. Stop waiting for a savior. Your attitude is the problem.

              I highly agree.  Some are hoping and waiting.  But We are the Person we have been waiting for.  We must be The One.  We must turn this Ship of Horrors around and stop thinking any of these elected elites  are going to save us.  Remember that while we are waiting for the swamp to be drained there are also many bills and laws that will be the undoing of this country.  Oh, yes there will be bills and law that we think are great while others are undoing us.  I don't trust any of them to Bail Us Out.  They will never give any of us the chance to achieve their wealth or even get close.  Never.

             Agreed.  And the other thing that makes YOUR points congruent:  Trump's enemies.
Why do the NeverTrumpers in the GOP all seem to be the elite Globalists in the Party?  When else have members of EITHER Parties' leadership worked to throw a Presidential campaign to the other side, as the GOPe did to Trump?
             <br/>
             If Trump belongs to any "cabal", it starts with those military Generals who are anti-Globalist, patriotic and opposed to both the Globalist, open borders agenda and the uglier stuff this board focuses on...

              Hey, I like the fantasy. I almost made a rock of my fast and high fived you. I like your fire. But the Trump hate started on queue. When it was show time, they all acted hysterical like he ran over their child. He isn't doing anything to them. He is one of them. And he is going to deliver the agenda he was selected to deliver. They need a divided nation. Trump vs the world has divided the country and kept the citizens at each other throats. Mission accomplished.

               Oh boy.  So True about the Military.  There have been arrests on here of soldiers filming the rape of girls at basses and other Military Pedo arrests.  There are many Military Higher Ups that are involved up to their necks in this Morass.  Make no mistake about it.

               Well, there's Mike Flynn, who was reportedly fired by the WH after Pence insisted on it.....because he didn't tell Pence about a pedo list he is keeping about government officials...so yeah, the Generals Trump is in with seem to be opposed to Globalism and pedophilia.
Obama GUTTED our military.  We need to be strong, there are real reasons to rebuild our military..especially as China and Russia both become more adventurous.
               <br/>
               More $$ into military systems (and the VA) does NOT = muh Military Industrial Complex, muh Dynacorp.
Robert Mercer worked AGAINST Trump throughout the primaries, the Koch Brothers are sworn enemies that continue to try to advance open borders.
And the vast majority of the CONGRESS has voted numerous times to make Jerusalem our recognized Israeli capitol.  Trump simply quit extending the annual delay every President has been doing for the last 3-4 Administrations.  So what in the hell does THAT prove?
Given that the REASON Obama and Bush kept delaying implementation was the anticipated reaction of the so-called "Palestinians", all Trump did was show that a strong US President could name our own capitol without Kowtowing to filthy terrorist potentates and prove that Obarry and GW Bush are huge pussies.

                 How old is the Temple in Jerusalem?  The first one.  A thousand years before Christ.  That'd be 1,600 years before Islam was even INVENTED.  And somehow, the Muslims MUST have that 1 little scrap of land that the Jews built their first Temple on?  Small world, I guess....What a coincidence!
                </p>
                <p>
                 The ONLY reason the Islam scum act like Jerusalem is important to them is they like to construct their mosques atop the religious centers of what they think are their "vanquished" enemies.  Like when they attempted to build a mosque @ the World Trade Center.  Plus they hate Israel, so the Arab Muslims want the constant state of war ....That tiny piece of land is Israel's, the Arab Muslims have territory all around it that is many hundreds of times as large.  And the Arabs that live there are almost all Jordanian.  There IS no Palestinian people.

               The tax plan STRENGTHENS the US economy.  Which the globalists have been trying to level down over the past 25 years to make Americans more amenable to global governance.

                One thing I do like about the new Saudi prince is he is giving women more civil rights. That is a step in the right direction.

                Saudi Arabia is elbow deep in debt to the western banking oligarchs. Nixon set up a deal in the 1970's for Saudia Arabia to funnel their surplus oil revenue into U.S. Treasury bonds. Biggest mistake the Saudis ever made too. Now they are trapped in Rothschild debt.

                A couple of years ago the western oligarchs rattled the sabers in Saudia Arabia,s direction by "finding" the "missing" 28 pages of 911 documentation that showed Saudi complicity in 911. House Of Saud helped U.S./British intel and Mossad pull off 911. That was a threat that Saudi would be left holding the bag alone, and bombed into the stone age, if they did not fulfill their role in destabilizing the middle east.

                Yep. The plan to destabilize the Middle East and steal resources from other nations is rolling right along. Innocent men, women, and children are being bombed out of their homes and killed for greedy western oligarchs and Trump is leading the charge by selling Saudia Arabia 110 Billion dollars worth of weapons to do it with.

                The Saudis are a bunch of murdering savages just like they always were. The part of the Saudi family that got arrested didn't want Salman to be King because they did not believe he was the rightful heir to the throne. They were afraid he would seize power, throw them under the bus, and take all their money, and take Saudia Arabia to war with Yemen and Iran and that is exactly what is happening.

                The Saudia Arabia take down was explained by "Q" as the third leg of the evil global triangle being taken down for the first time in history. That is laughable beyond all proportions.

                  Middle East destabilization started right after the 911 psyop and has nothing to do with Iran. It started with Iraq's fake "weapons of mass destruction" which never existed. They destroyed Iraq and have not stopped because they are not finished yet.

            Glad you put this together. There really is too much evidence if anyone looks at it objectively. The reality is just too painful for many people. I am optimistic that at least the deep state is loosing credibility daily.

             I wanted to get on here last night and show some support DTM but sat back to see this thread get a pummeling. It's unfortunate that these people won't do the research themselves so they can see who trump really is and there is every indication in the world that he is simply an interim ruse being used to polarize the population,  until they find the opportunity to install pence.

             Really,  everything you need to work from is contained in those two sentences,  people are too conditioned to step back from the partisanship to see the reality that it's ALL WRAPPED UP.

             They need to lose power, not cred. The sheeple will never join in. They will never arrest themselves. He is one of them, always was. Rothschild don't bail out you and I. I don't know what more can be done for those waiting for a hero. Start with ourselves. Stop banking. That is step one.

             There is no deep state.  It is in fact quite on the surface.  EVERY CANDIDATE MUST KISS AIPAC'S RING this is by far the most basic and known fact about American presidential politics.

                 Nice try but you said "racist" and there's no such thing as that either.  Accepting PG is Jews means redpilling on the WHOLE JEWISH QUESTION which is impossible with so many naive women involved which is why they invented racism and indeed why they pushed universal suffrage.  Absolutely nothing can change until women can't vote anymore and since cucked men won't enforce that there will be a race war.  CLEAR AS DAY which is why I'm not paying my student loans -- credit scores won't mean shit soon enough.

             What is cherry picking? Is the evidence cherry picked in this thread, or not? Is there evidence of Trump being AGAINST pedophilia? Is THAT evidence cherry picked, our not?  Which evidence is MORE cherry picked, if you try to select two sets of evidence? Look at ALL possible evidence, and put it in a big picture context.

              Well, there is no PG ivnestigation. He has never even uttered a word about it. The alternative media is selling that he is SECRETLEY fighting them, and secretley arresting them, and secretley making plans against them. The reality is he has been in cahoots with them his entire life. My friends didn't do 9/11. My friends don't have islands where they indulge under age girls and I wasn't invited. My friends don't get bailed out by Rothschild INC. How bout any of you? He wouldn't walk across the street to piss on any of you if you were on fire. He lives in a palace for Christ sake. Wake up.

               The "alternative media" has proven much better at predicting and explaining events than the obviously corrupt and significantly controlled MSM is. The fact that you are on this board, which fundamentally is "alternative media", denouncing alternative media, is a suggestive one indeed.

               And again you repeat your as-yet-entirely-unsupported claim that he is "one of them" with more emotional rhetoric. You ought to make arguments rather than speeches.

                Yes. I cherry picked every time he was involved with people that it is a red flag for him to be involved with. I did not show his harmless connections. I cherry picked every time he was involved or at least accused of child traficking, rape, or his good friends being guilty of these things. I cherry picked his secret society connections and didn't bring up his non secret society connections. So?

                 Cherry picking leads to an inaccurate picture. You should try to account for all evidence. For example, Trump spoke out against Epstein when others didn't. That puts all other interactions with shady characters in a different light. This is one example that shows how misleading cherry picking is.

                Red herring. Trying to dismiss it all with one phrase "cherry picking", does not make it go away.

                  The Catholic church is proven, practically every week by a new priest busted for pedophilia, that the Catholic Church is full of pedophiles. It is very "cherry picking" selective to ignore the Jesuit role in pedophilia. This sub protects Catholic pedophiles because Trump has a Jesuit background. Everytime someone posts the documentary of survivors who were raped and tortured by the Catholic Church when they were children it gets immediately and swiftly deleted. Interesting how that is not relevant to pizzagate innit?

                   Pedophilia in the church is a separate subject. Injecting it only CONFUSES the discussion by diffusing its focus. And it is also a nearly universal tactic used by those that seek to disrupt discussion and create an atmosphere of dispute where cooperation is far more productive.

              You make a good point in general but that isn't how posts typically work. People share their own perspective. I believe the data pointing to Trump cleaning the swamp and taking down pedos is primarily hype. I'm glad Trump is president instead of Hillary at least they are putting on a good show of it.
