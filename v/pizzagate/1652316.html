<p>What struck me most about the CIAAnon post was the system s/he said was being administered by their team. CIAAnon said s/he was working on a tool that aggregates and manages all backdoor deals done by Elites all around the world and making sure debts get paid. We are investigating a group of people who backdoor deal using favors, children, drugs, etc. and install their own children or victims into politics and at very strategic places. What this would seem to indicate is that the failure of Clinton to cinch the presidency puts her in a very bad situation if she was counting on this power to complete a lot of operations and pay her debts.</p>
<p>Essentially, this system kinda works like the Clinton Global Initiative. People who really want in to the Elite\'s circles will give money to the Clinton Foundation and be invited to Bill Clinton\'s event in NYC. It happens at exactly the same time as the UN meets every Fall. During this event, people are given access to VIPs and they must make a promise to change something (do &quot;good&quot;) or else they will never be invited again. This sounds like the same kind of system as CIAAnon was alluding to, but in the world of people who really want CREDIT and FAME and PRESTIGE in the process.</p>
<p>This ties to pizzagate in the sense that we are trying to understand how the chain of command works for people above the &quot;service class&quot; (Alefantis) into the &quot;Mid-level management&quot; (Podesta) and up the &quot;VIP Class&quot; who are the Elites on a global scale.</p>',

            Thank you I could not remember the name, during that debate over Andrew Kline I remember thinking that slightly changing your name would be a good way to avoid being connected to certain things but still being able to use your credentials officially. It is common to file documents with Slight name variations, it does not raise eyebrows typically. Yet here we are no one knows if he is the same lawyer.

            They seem to reuse names and different versions of names I think to make it more difficult to know what they are talking about. So am email could refer to CGI and it might seem to be about something run of the mill but in fact it is regarding something very nefarious. I have noticed this is a pattern with them. The same name will have multiple meaning attached to it. CP : child porn or cheese pizza  James alefantis, Jaime lenfant. It's all I can think of offhand. There was even a lot of debate over a lawyer who was associated with cpp and also the DOJ. They both had very similar and it was very hard to tell if they were the same. I believe this is intentional fits with their pattern.

            Very interesting to me as I had heard elsewhere recently something like "the Bush family has paid all it's debts and is sort of staying out of things now"  and I didn't really understand what "debts" meant in this context.  I'd like to know more about this.
