                 Wait... your post is all over the place... you are still focused on the Don Jr. meeting w/ Veselsketnya? You think sensitive material was passed back and forth? Where is it? From the most recent intel I saw this didn't lead to much of anything. And it was already established that the meeting itself wasn't illegal.
                </p>
                <p>
                 As for this:
                </p>
                <blockquote>
                 <p>
                  Don't give me names of websites, explain the evidence other than 4chan inventing a code for hacked email which started this bullshit. I do believe paedophilia is far too rampant in all walks &gt;of life. There has also been cover ups for all kinds of things but that isn't evidence for this, as i'm sure you understand.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  i don't see links to the occult, neither do I see strange language, only the type of shorthand everyone uses with friends. It's funny because for all your denials you are admitting here it's all about the "strange languages" which the guys who gave you the grifter was happy to interpret.
                 </p>
                </blockquote>
                <p>
                 You don't think the prior cover-ups and the extent at which they've been covered up, adds anything to what we're collectively looking into? Hampstead, Saville, Epstein, The Dutroux Affair, the Catholic Church, reports of Hollywood pedophelia/cover-ups... none of this causes you to draw any parallels when it comes to the PG evidence?
                </p>
                <p>
                 You don't see links to the occult? Spirit Cooking? Moloch? Mother Moon? Mentions of sacrifices? The artists/musicians that were related to those who are linked to the Podesta links?
                </p>
                <p>
                 You think these are all just innocent jokes? I think they may never be proven, but, that they offer important surrounding context.

                  You don't see links to Russia? Manafort? Flynn? rohrababacher? Sater? The bit part players who were linked to Russians. Cohn? Page? Stone? Assange? Don jr? Kushner?

                  Are these are just innocent jokes? I'm sure several of these names will be indicted by the grand jury Mueller set up. And it will be obstruction of justice which impeaches trump before his own indictment.

                   I've said numerous times that it's all circumstantial... I simply provided a number of examples that were also only circumstantial to begin with - and all underwent extreme levels of suppression in attempts to cover tracks.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   Yes. I see some of those Russian connections, but certainly not all of them. Stone and Assange? Really? C"mon... you're drinking the wrong Kool Aid.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   Manafort? Kushner? Don Jr? Yeah. Sure. I get it. But I want to see what they actually did/conspired to do... so far it's all discussions and seemingly unrelated biz deals.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   Mueller is keeping a super tight lid on his findings, acting with a level of professionalism that makes Comey look like a fucking joke that he is/was. I am hoping that he delivers concrete findings for WHOMEVER (Left or Right) is implicated and cracks the whip.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   But when it comes to Assange's evidence the Russia did not hack vs. domestic leaks... and comparing this to Crowdstrike's "report"? I'll put my money on Assange.

                    I'm not going to waste my time presenting a thoroughly researched post with links. I'll leave that to arewesure. However if you're willing to present your evidence in support of pizzagate, then i'll take the time to explain  Russian infiltration and influence of the US elections.

                     BTW - the presentation of (circumstantial) evidence in support of Pizzagate is all of the high ranked posts here on Voat. To randomly hold me, individually, to a higher standard than everyone looking into this on Voat, Reddit, Chan, YouTube, etc... makes absolutely no sense.

                     To question why I'm here also doesn't make any sense. Because I single-handedly am unable to provide concrete evidence to prove PG, I should leave?

                  You are still focused on the Don Jr. meeting w/ Veselsketnya? ... From the most recent intel I saw this didn't lead to much of anything. And it was already established that the meeting itself wasn't illegal.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  There are several things that have come out of this meeting that have significance for a prosecutor.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  For one, when you apply for a security clearance you have to list the meetings you have had with foreign nationals.  Jared Kushner did not do that.  This is a crime within itself
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  The Trump camp lied about it for several days straight, which indicates they clearly wanted to cover it up.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  We then learned that the President himself was involved in these lies, aids initially wanted to release a truthful statement, but the President overruled them and took part in revising the statement and coming up with the dishonest cover story.  So there is potential obstruction of justice charges if anything illegal occurred during the meeting.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  We just learned the White House Counsel almost resigned recently because he was worried that Kushner and the President were meeting to coordinate stories, so the White House Counsel is afraid of possible obstruction of justice.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  So what crime might have taken place?   Paul Manafort took notes during that meeting and the special counsel has them.  One of the notes said "active sponsors of the RNC."  After this meeting Russian Americans flowed 2 million dollars to the RNC and the Trump campaign.  The special counsel is looking to see if they were directed to give this money or of this money really came from foreign sources.

                   Ok... I guess we'll see what Mueller's findings are. There have been so many "Strike outs" with the Russian narrative, it's hard for me to believe the seriousness of these angles until some concrete evidence is presented.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   And before we get all riled up and start saying "But, wait, no, THESE ARE crimes..." let's not be quick to forget how many actual crimes were committed within the HRC/DNC email debacles that went totally unpunished.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   I'm not suggesting that 2 wrongs cancel each other out. Only an observation of the hilarious unbalanced scale of justice when it comes to the Left Side (will do/say/grant immunity to anyone to avoid indictment) vs. the Right Side (will grasp at all straws possible to find ANYTHING to indict with).
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   If Trump or anyone on his team is found guilty of working with/accepting funding from Russian sources tied to the Kremlin - they should absolutely be held accountable. But it will be a slap in the face to the entire country if they are held over a fire and HRC/Lynch/Comey all walk away unscathed from a clearly compromised investigation... not to mention the pre-existing ties to Russia on top of that pile of nonsense that relate back to Clinton/Podesta.
