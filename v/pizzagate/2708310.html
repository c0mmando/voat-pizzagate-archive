<p>Among the horrific revelations of a 1,356-page Pennsylvania grand jury report that found more than 1,000 identifiable child victims were abused by over 300 Catholic priests, one stands out starkly: Priests allegedly used church property to produce child pornography.</p>
<p>With one priest, George Zirwas, the grand jury says his diocese knew of complaints starting in 1987 that he purportedly sexually abused children. Zirwas was shuffled among positions until he was placed on “personal leave” in 1995, which lasted until he was murdered in Havana, Cuba, in May 2001. The report claims Zirwas and three other priests created child pornography in parishes and rectories using whips, violence, and sadism while raping their victims.</p>

<p>George said he never discussed the nude Polaroids, or the twisted, secret gifts he and the other kids had been given decades ago by the men who preyed on them. These weren’t the kinds of things you could share without feeling humiliated, especially if you grew up tough, like he did on the South Side of Pittsburgh.</p>
<p>But you can’t outrun your nightmares forever. So on Dec. 17 — a week before Roman Catholics around the world celebrated Christmas — George met with a Pennsylvania grand jury and told it about the Rev. George Zirwas, a friendly young priest who once took him to a rectory in Munhall, a borough about 25 minutes from downtown Pittsburgh, and introduced him to some friends: The Revs. Francis Pucci, Richard Zula, and Francis Luddy.</p>
<p>During a conversation about religious statues, the priests told George to get onto a bed and remove his shirt, and strike a pose like Jesus on the cross. Then they instructed him to strip off his pants and underwear, according to a grand jury report released Tuesday by Pennsylvania Attorney General Josh Shapiro.</p>
<p>In the unnerving moments that followed, George claimed that Zula or Pucci began taking photos of him on a Polaroid camera. All of the priests giggled  — and then added the photos of George to a collection of photos of other teen boys. According to the grand jury, these men and another priest, the Rev. Robert Wolk, were part of a “ring of predatory priests” who raped children, shared intelligence on potential victims, and manufactured child pornography in parishes and rectories.</p>
<p>“This group of priests used whips, violence, and sadism in raping their victims,” reads one line of the nearly 900-page document, which outlines horrific abuse that occurred in Pittsburgh and five other Catholic dioceses across the state.</p>
<p>The men gave a specific gift to children they favored, something they could wear that would mark them as prime targets for abuse. Zirwas “had told me that they, the priests, would give their boys, their altar boys, or their favorite boys these crosses,” George told the grand jury. “So he gave me a big gold cross to wear.” ,...</p>
<p>According to Tuesday’s report, Zula “engaged in violent sexual activity” with a child at a rectory in the Pittsburgh Diocese. Church records further described parties Zula hosted for children that featured marijuana, alcohol, oral sex, attempted anal sex, and whips. He was sentenced to five years in prison in 1990, and died last year.</p>

             Agree. They were forced to, but still. Being forced to means this is so compelling they couldn't ignore it or tap dance around it. They couldn't even put a spin on it, but the way that airhead asking the questions and making the statement about not calling the police was apologetic -- like one  member of the cabal to an elite member of the cabal. Deferential.

            Shapiro's own tribe preaches pedophilia, this seems to be a manufactured pile of paid for false allegations to distract from the real shit....look homos, peds, and communists were sent into all major denominations carrying their dogshit with them but the claim there were so many kids and priests involved is highly irregular.. In fact its retardedly so. Hell even the primary accusers at Boystown said it was hush hush and only the few at the tops knew what the hell was going on.

             It's very much in line with what is known. There were other locales where priest pedo rings operated. I was going to try to post on at least to other documented cases so we can begin piecing together the scope of this. I mean, yes, we know the scope is global, but in terms of known cases where there are records and court filings.

            If they would just fire everyone in every prosecutor's office and police office and at the FBI and add everyone on this message board to a task force, we'd track down every single person on the dark web who produces or looks at child porn and systematically put them away to rot for life until there's no more demand and the industry becomes too big a risk for anyone to engage in. But instead, they just keep giving probation to child rapists and letting them move into houses with small children etc. It's disgusting!!!

             It is frightening.
            </p>
            <p>
             And the same type of brainwashing is occurring politically. The crazed need to follow an ideology even when it means the destruction of your country and ideals is being played out. We'll see what happens in the midterm elections because a lot of people appear to be getting woke! And there's lots and lots of times for things to fall out of the Vault of Secrets and Lies. I believe everything is being held back until the Supreme Court pick and a few more judges take their rightful positions. Must be crucial to have them in place.

              The Supreme Court pick is against Roe Vs Wade...does not consider it settled law.Women seeking abortions can be criminally prosecuted. Wonder if that will make the Supreme Court totally Catholic except for one Jewish woman. That should fix things nicely ....turn US into South America where everybody is Catholic.

            The cops are complicit too. That's why the charges are always non-existent or at best bogus.

           <blockquote>
            <p>
             In 1981, Erie Diocese priest Robert F. Bower was found to have collected child pornography, but one of the four diocesan workers who reported it to a priest in church was fired. She, the priest’s secretary, and another co-worker retained the material in case it could be used in the future.
             <strong>
              When Bower was charged with possession of child pornography, the women took the material to the police, but the material was destroyed without additional charges being filed. The original charges against the priest were dropped because of mishandling of evidence.

             Great point.

             Definitely were corrupt and no doubt paid off. This situation couldn't have existed without the compliance of the police. People had to know, and they did. And even with The Vatican's elite leading the charges, law enforcement had to be on their side for the cover-up to be complete.

             How dare they destroy evidence? Those children needed a voice and the filthy bastards that went along and protected this scum shut down the chance for justice to be done for the victims. It's mind blowing. I am going to try to put something together that will show the extent of this corruption within the church and, in at least one other case, the extent politicians and police went to hide the abuse.

            nope. not worse that 'we' imagined because some people have recognised the church for exactly what it is for their entire lives, keep openly talking about it, and keep getting told people will pray for their souls. (usually those same people quite enjoy a priests finger in their arsehole)

              It's somewhat understandable though. Since simple good people tend to over protect (isolate themselves) and more sophisticated good people don't generally prefer their company for obvious reasons, even though they ARE trusted as good people. It's a jungle out there in a lot of ways, and the weak (simple) are the classic prey of the damned.
             </p>
             <p>
              Works both ways though. simple evil folk don't know what they bit off when they go after a sophisticated (smart) good person, since they assume everyone is as "smart" as they are.

               If a tough guy wanted to rob someone, he certainly isn't going to pick on someone as big as he is. But the thing is "charm" is the best weapon of all.

             I'm going to try to put together a thread highlighting other incidents of pedo priest abuse so people can get an idea of how pervasive this was and how The Vatican, law enforcement, and political flunkies all conspired to cover this up.

            Wowzers. I don't think anyone is surprised. This is what you get when you Latinize the Catholic Church and turn it over to these cults and weird phallic worshipping of the sentimental that characterizes the Latin mind. It spreads like wildfire into the Catholic Mind.
           </p>
           <p>
            Catholicism was good once upon a merry time, but the Latinization effect is causing it to become sort of like a phallic version of the Tower of Babel.

             The Romans saw a Trojan horse way to gain control of the growing masses following Christ's teachings. At first they fought it, but why, when they could build a church and claim ownership of the doctrine they mocked and ridiculed It has worked beautifully for them, but we were onto them through the brilliance and truth of John's Revelaton. The False Prophet and Whore of Babylon have been The Pope and The Catholic Church.

             It's Babylon we have to worry about ... not Latins. Thanks.

             The men gave a specific gift to children they favored, something they could wear that would mark them as prime targets for abuse. Zirwas “had told me that they, the priests, would give their boys, their altar boys, or their favorite boys these crosses,” George told the grand jury. “So he gave me a big gold cross to wear.”

           <p>
            If we could get pictures from around that time frame of those altar boys we could pick out which boys were being raped. The big gold crosses worn only by some of the boys would be the giveaway. I wonder for how long that was the case or if it still continues today.

             Good question. I'm sure each cult/ring has its own way of handling things but giving kids presents seems the standard way to go.

             Yes, if the boys were wearing the crosses, they would be markedly different than the others and would stand out.

            Brazil's federal police has announced that a nationwide investigation over the course of a year into the circulation of child pornography among users of private "darknet" networks has resulted in the arrest of 55 people — including teachers, priests, and at least one member of the military.
           </p>
           <p>
            "This is the first time that the Brazilian police has done an operation like this, seeking targets in the darknet," Rafael França, coordinator of the aptly named Operation Darknet, told VICE News.

            Faucher, who retired as a priest three years, was arraigned Monday on 14 different charges, including 10 felony counts of sexual exploitation of a child and two felony counts of distributing sexually exploitative material involving children.

           <p>
            The alarm bells going off inside the Vatican only continue to echo through its halls in relation to the numerous Priests having been accused of engaging in pedophilia-laced activities such as child pornography, and now Vatican police have arrested Fr. Carlo Alberto Capella for the possession of child pornography with the concern that he intended to distribute the illicit materials for sale to unknown buyers.
           </p>
           <p>
            The Vatican and the Catholic Church have had numerous Priests accused of sexually assaulting children, with even more of them being labeled as engaging in the viewing of child pornography.
           </p>
           <p>
            A quick search of the internet will show you the dozens of cases of Priests, Cardinals, Bishops, and others employed within the Catholic Church who have faced similar charged in the last several years, raising more than eyebrows when wondering how such a powerful, tax-exempt religious organization not only engages in the sexual abuse of minor children but also then in-turn attempts to cover up the crimes committed against innocent children.
           </p>
           <p>
            This is the same diplomat who was engaging in the believed production of child pornography last year, after being caught with child pornography inside of Washington, DC while serving a diplomatic mission into the United States of America.
           </p>
           <p>
            The US State Department had claimed that the high-profile Fr. Carlo Alberto Capella, who was working at the Vatican’s Embassy in Washington, DC had violated federal law by possessing child pornography.

              So much so that maybe its time to remove tbe protective mantle these priests  have enjoyed for so long and come out with bumper stickers and  Tshirts that proclaim "Priests belong in jail".

               Everyone can just tweet with a link to the story using one of the notable quotes to pique interest. Don't say what the story is about, use a quote and the link with maybe a hashtag. How about #childmolestationendsnow

              Unfortunately I feel it will be news today and gone tomorrow for still so many out there.  It seems impossible to get people to look at something that is so depraved that they can't bear the thought of it for any length of time.  Believe me I have tried.

               But that's the beauty of this evidence. You can break it up into quotes and tweet it. Nobody that isn't woke is going to want to sit down and read that report, but if you break it up into horrific quotes and the link to read it, it'll work. Guaranteed. Don't even try to shove the whole thing whole at someone. Think about feeding a kid something he is resistant to eating. You bargain with them and ask them to take a bite. That's what this'll be. You're just tweeting a quote without any explanation of which side you're on. Maybe come up with a compelling hashtag. It's a real chance to get through.

                I understand that.  The problem is people's cognitive dissonance.  People I have thought are good and intelligent have looked at a little bit of evidence and then just stopped themselves going further due to the horrific nature of the topic.
               </p>
               <p>
                For example the fact that 250,000 to 300,000 children go missing in Europe or that between 460,000 to 800,000 children are reported missing in the US every year does grab people's attention.  I mean, that's like one kid every 3 seconds (roughly).  But then, after looking a little more people clutch at any excuse for this like they're mainly runaways or just immigrant kids.  They won't look deeper.
               </p>
               <p>
                In this particular case people will just say it's a bad group within the church and move on.
               </p>
               <p>
                I hate to say it.
               </p>
               <p>
                Of course, I think we should continue to push the message and even if we only convert one person then it's better today than yesterday.
               </p>
               <p>
                And sorry for being cynical, but after so many years fighting this it is difficult to believe things will change.  Though I truly and always find myself hoping that I'm wrong.

                 This report is rife with things to refute this and to "woke" people up. It clearly states the cover up started at the top. And the group was 300, involved six dioceses, and affected THOUSANDS of children. Further, it states that the cover up started at the top of The Vatican food chain.
                </p>
                <p>
                 I think the problem is that we have to be insistent on getting this out there. We have to be clever in finding ways to get people to look further. It's like anything else, you have to find the right key. So if you understand all this, then find a way to counteract it to get through. Naturally, the propagandists and media will treat it the way they treated the other pedo priest stories, but if you're this intelligent ... you figure it out. Each one of us has to figure out how to get people interested enough.
                </p>
                <p>
                 And if I can find time, I really will post a couple of more cases that went on during the approximate time to show just how pervasive this was. Three hundred pedo priests is not one nameless loser. That's THREE HUNDRED who actively took part in sadististically and ritually molesting, raping, and torturing children ... and filming it to produce pornography for even more sickos! If we can't find a way to get people interested, we're not trying.

             Thanks. I was happy to do it.

             I feel this is one of most important stories to come out. It's not speculation, it's cold, hard fact. No one can say anyone is fantasizing or blame it on a right-wing conspiracy. This is real and all the filthy, depraved details are in there. Anyone with a heart will feel for what those kids went through, and anyone with a sense of morality will demand justice for all such abused chldren.

             Remarkable details and presented in a no-nonsense fashion by a determined AG. He does not look happy about this ... at all.

             More to come, but this really will set up the what's next to come. And I am very anxious to see who defends this. They will be on my radar forever if they make excuses or become an enabler for this to go on.

                I dont think that comment was intended to minimize the Pittsburgh experience  but just the opposite.  If we multiple this by the number of dioceses nationwide and around the world we are looking at thousands and thousands of perpetrators and perhaps millions of victims.

                It was quite appropriate after all that the 1970s  construction of the Popes Audience  Hall of  the Vatican took the form of a serpent.  Did the architect play a joke on the Catholic Church? Was this payback for the architect's own childhood abuse by a priest?

                 And I'm sure the church personally requested the snake theme. It was more a joke on the devoted followers who have made them filthy rich and a law unto themselves. So disgusting and so totally the opposite of what Christianity is about. Please remember they are the ones that called Mary Magdelene a whore. Jesus' closest confidante who the other disciples were jealous of they labeled a whore. The tagging still exist today even after the tepid apology.

                 It's worse than sick. How could those kids deal with this? It's not even like they had everyone on their side? They were isolated and left to try to piece back their broken lives on their own. I mean, they couldn't talk about it, could they. If they did, they'd be called liars and/or crazy, and asked why they were saying such horrible lies about priests.
                </p>
                <p>
                 It reminds me of the Larry Nassar case a lot. Remember, that one girl ... can't remember her name at the moment ... but when she came out and told her family what was going on, they turned against her! They first sided with Nassar and accused her of lying. They did eventually reverse their opinion, but with these pedo priests, most families didn't do that. They were so indoctrinated to think these men were holy that any criticism was looked upon with contempt and condemned.

              This is scathing.  Also there was a letter sent addressed to the Pope signed by 37K Catholic Women.  It went to the DC diocese.  They want answers.  It's been on the news.

            George said he never discussed the nude Polaroids, or the twisted, secret gifts he and the other kids had been given decades ago by the men who preyed on them. These weren’t the kinds of things you could share without feeling humiliated, especially if you grew up tough, like he did on the South Side of Pittsburgh.

So on Dec. 17 — a week before Roman Catholics around the world celebrated Christmas — George met with a Pennsylvania grand jury and told it about the Rev. George Zirwas, a friendly young priest who once took him to a rectory in Munhall, a borough about 25 minutes from downtown Pittsburgh, and introduced him to some friends: The Revs. Francis Pucci, Richard Zula, and Francis Luddy.
           </p>
           <p>
            During a conversation about religious statues, the priests told George to get onto a bed and remove his shirt, and strike a pose like Jesus on the cross. Then they instructed him to strip off his pants and underwear, according to a grand jury report released Tuesday by Pennsylvania Attorney General Josh Shapiro.
           </p>

            It gets really sick after this.  I will leave it to others to read.  It's just awful and Victims may be triggered. Catholics all over the world need to get out into the streets and demand the pope resign.  Now.

             "Which it did when Cardinal Wuerl approved the removal of a priest from a parish for denying communion to a self-described agitprop Buddhist lesbian. Cardinal Wuerl does not ruffle feathers, even at the expense of established Church doctrine"

             This 300 priests shit is kind of retarded, I seriously doubt the fucking ((yellow)) journalism number also this shit was routed out in 1988 he went to Cuba with is insane in and of itself for that time. Seems to me a 30 year old story with all kinds of shit surrounding it from decades ago blowing up now? Again with inflated figures, that little clique was real but they were prosecuted and convicted back in 88.

              All those that can go, should go.  Everyone that has been waiting for justice should find a way to let the pope know he has to go.  I have a feeling this will be an Epic Moment.

             What good does it do for the current pope to resign? They have all been complicit. I posit that all those catholics should get out into the streets and LEAVE THE CHURCH that has been doing this for centuries.

               The really really sad thing is all the good people that were raised in the church and try to do good are going to be tarnished by this as well. But the catholic church has been committing atrocities for almost as long as it has existed so hopefully this will get them to realize.
              </p>
              <p>
               Its sad though. All that history and so much good that is utterly destroyed by the systemic evil they have allowed to grow and harbored for the past thousand years.

                I can see your point, but we can't allow that to happen.  We can cast out the evil doers finally.  It will take some time.  I am not going to let them ruin our Church.  We can not give up our faith because of these perverted sick men of Satan.  Remember, that if we let them kill our Church Satan has won.  The devil will take over.  No way.

             This is unbelievably damning! It's going to start to take the blinders off people's eyes, and for that I'm grateful, but those poor, poor kids. They had no one to turn to. No one would believe them and no one cared.

              You are brainwashed clearly....I swear you will buy a false paid for allegation by jews anyday of the week right? Fact child molestation cases in terms of non guardian approaches tend to be reported admittedly claiming something happened 30 years after is always full of shit specifically when the people accused are dead. You are ignoring the basic tenet of accusations fresh and immediate tend to be legit, but facts a have to be fleshed out so far dozens of hate crime paid for political stunt hoaxes have been outed as fable....Nothing not a whiff for 30 years now this shit, Secrets aren't kept that damn long on this scale from Dahmer, to Gacy, to Delta, to Franklin, to Dutroux it was always rumored, allegations, rap sheets, and a general whiff of it in the air. Hell Sandusky had CLAIMS brought against him but was protected by the political and college establishment for years. Oh yeah btw Polanski and Epstein weren't priests you are looking in the wrong direction and Shapiro and his fucked up family aren't reliable. Duke Lacrosse man see through the bullshit.

               " leftoid Norvus ordo types in league with the Shapiros".........Google the Franklin conspiracy. Right / Left/Hollywood....the people with the proclivities are chosen for the justice dept., law enforcement advancement , military and business. Right and Left is mostly who is currently in office.The naming of political affiliation takes away from the message.

              I remember watching an HBO special many years ago after the Boston dustup where they interviewed one of the now adult men who came forward. His entire family disowned him and all guilted him over ratting out their priest. I was horrified and if people won't even stand up beside a family member who is an adult and can articulate everything that happened to them imagine how impossible it would be for a child. Such brainwashing is just incomprehensible. Catholicism is so consistently evil and yet millions of people still justify their existence by saying it is only a few priests that are bad. 300 in just this one investigation!!

                If your child is threatened and fearful to tell anyone, how does that make a parent negligent? Are you suggesting that children should never leave the sight of the parents? People who are raised in the church automatically trust these authority figures.

               Exactly!
              </p>
              <p>
               This is not some random priest going after an altar boy. This was ORGANIZED. They traveled with these kids and produced CP! What do these parisioners think that was for? It was to sell! It's the only reason you make it in the first place.
              </p>
              <p>
               The fact it was systematically organized means there were many, many players involved. There had to be to distribute, cover up, give statements, allay a parent's fear if a child did speak about it. But it's what I mean. This will start to take off those blinders, but more will come. When the avanlanche starts, those people will be WOKE!
