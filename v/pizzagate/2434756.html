<p>The Global Slavery Index of 2017 reports that 45.8 million people are enslaved in the world today.

<p>Although my point has been made, one has to get a &quot;feeling&quot; about the enormity of it all, so here is a &quot;dynamic&quot; list (meaning there are thousands of others that come under 2 different headings that I will address later) of organizations and charities that &quot;combat&quot; human trafficking.</p>

<p>That\'s it for the &quot;dynamic&quot; list.  The 2 additional entities are:
▪Freedom Collaborative, managed by Liberty Asia
▪globalmodernslavery.org</p>
<p>Freedom Collaborative labels itself as a &quot;One connected global anti-trafficking community-based platform which brings anti-trafficking organizations and stakeholders from around the world together.&quot;  The partnership with Liberty Asia &quot;is changing the way slavery and trafficking is addressed by leveraging technology and expertise.&quot;  It further states that &quot;Chab Dai (part of CGI) for the past decade, has built a network of organizations on the frontier to end all forms of abuse and exploitation through knowledge sharing and collaboration.</p>
<p>Global Modern Slavery has - wait for this - 2,479 organizations.  The Global Modern Slavery Directory was launched in 2014 by the CGI, and I believe I read it reached or it was thought to reach 3,000 organizations in 2017.
