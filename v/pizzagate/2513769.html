<p>And now for something completely different. A creed that is the foundation of the righteous anon and should be the central tenet for us as well. You can tell who the shills are by how they blatently spit on these ideals (like a certain asshole we all know and hate). Granted I\'m not perfect, but I at least try to adhere to this ideal.</p>
<p>&quot;The righteous anon believes in Lady Justice.
Lady Justice doesn\'t see color of skin.
Lady Justice doesn\'t see race.
Lady Justice doesn\'t see gender.
Lady Justice doesn\'t see sexual preference.
Lady Justice doesn\'t see religious preference.
Lady Justice doesn\'t see political ideology.
Lady Justice doesn\'t see ancestry.
Lady Justice sees criminal behavior.
Lady Justice sees without prejudice.

            Hi, if there is a tiny link related to money gained from the trafficking, will that effectively flag all assets involved? I mean, that's a lot of stocks, plus "plea deals" and I'm thinking of the executive order "Blocking the Property of Persons Involved in Serious Human Rights Abuse or Corruption".

            Question - Has a Clinton Foundation member list ever been posted? I'd like to confirm Sara and Clare Bronfman are members of the Clinton Foundation? I don't doubt they are, heck, everyone that wants something should be a member as I get that it's a good reference to have if you're a freak.
           </p>
           <p>
            Many thanks, stay good.

            Why even have these insane high bonds if they are gonna let her out anyway...Do you really expect us to believe that she came up with 500k cash with her successful career as a hasbeen b rate starlette? I mean sure they may have bonded her out to keep her quiet but 500k with what? Supposed frozen assets?

            <strong>
             Rochester woman tells all about life with NXIVM's Keith Raniere, her ex
            </strong>
            <a href="https://www.democratandchronicle.com/story/news/politics/albany/2018/03/08/rochester-woman-battles-nxivm-keith-raniere/360847002/">
             https://www.democratandchronicle.com/story/news/politics/albany/2018/03/08/rochester-woman-battles-nxivm-keith-raniere/360847002/
            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            It was 1991, two years after Raniere was listed as having one of the highest IQs in the Guinness Book of World Records.
           </p>
           <p>
            Natalie and her husband bought into Consumer's Buyline (ranieres first company), which promised steep discounts on goods and services for a membership fee. Members got a commission for selling memberships to others. (pyramid scheme)
           </p>
           <p>
            Within a year, Natalie and her son had moved to Clifton Park after Raniere secured her a job with a skincare company that Consumer's Buyline partnered with.
           </p>
           <p>
            By 1997, however, the relationship was breaking down.
           </p>
           <p>
            Raniere and Natalie had met Nancy Salzman, with whom Raniere would go on to co-found NXIVM.
           </p>
           <p>
            His followers began calling him "Vanguard" and bow when he entered a room, a practice that was ultimately included in a 2000 patent application for "Rational Inquiry," a personal-improvement system that's a key part of the NXIVM philosophy.
           </p>
           <hr/>
           <p>
            And then from Wikipedia:
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NXIVM">
             https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NXIVM
            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            In 1998, Raniere and associate Nancy Salzman founded NXIVM in upstate New York, offering "executive success programs." Reportedly, over 12,000 people have attended the classes between its founding in 1998 and 2010.[12] Its clients have included Richard Branson as well as actresses Linda Evans, Allison Mack, Kristin Kreuk, and Nicki Clyne.
           </p>
           <p>
            <a href="http://35.169.129.179//wp-content/uploads/2018/01/esp_nancy_salzman.jpg">
             NANCY SALZMAN
            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            With over thirty years of intensive study and practice in the fields of healthcare, human potential and human empowerment, Nancy brings an incredible wealth of knowledge, wisdom and experience to her role as President of Executive Success Programs. Nancy spent many years seeking out and mastering models of human empowerment—from
            <strong>
             Neuro-linguistic Programming (having studied with both Bandler and Grinder)
            </strong>
            to psychobiology (with Joan Borysenko) to Ericksonian Brief Solution Based therapy (studying directly under Milton Erickson, Ernest Rossi and Stephen Gilligan). She practiced individual and family counseling before expanding to the field of human potential.
           </p>
           <p>
            What I'm seeing is that Raniere's knowledge of INTRICATE BLACKMAIL OPERATIONS, demanding compromising and allegedly illegal extortion material BE MADE BY THE MEMBER THEMSELVES long with the branding, COMBINED with SALZMAN'S knowledge of
            <strong>
             N
            </strong>
            euro
            <strong>
             L
            </strong>
            inguistic
            <strong>
             P
            </strong>
            rogramming, having studied with Bander and Grinder personally, is really something to behold.
           </p>
           <p>
            I'm concerned about Raniere's level of knowledge on the Mk-Ultra program, it's obvious he uses similar techniques. I wonder if it came upon him in his research naturally and he utilized it in his companies or if he was actually part of  a broader government operation.
           </p>
           <p>
            Now I'm trying to figure out if they were part of a larger program or if their little scheme grew organically within the organization. it's obvious many corporations and large donors bought into the program later on.

            The weight and momentum of this snowball that is careening toward the controllers of this world might just actually have a chance of burying them in enough detritus as to immobilize them and their plans before they have a chance at covering it all up with a world war.
