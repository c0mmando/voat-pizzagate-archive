            Some great stuff here to help all goats and OP to open the eyes of the people. Numbers and education are the route to success IMO. That’s why I believe the year 2020 has been so crazy. I think elitist pulled the trigger earlier because too many people are getting clued up. I see and hear it everywhere. People in the pub. Comments on totally unrelated YouTube videos. People are communicating using ‘red pilled’ language. They are nervous.... they are definitely getting concerned

            Most people have heard of Jesus Christ, considered the Messiah by Christians, and who lived 2000 years ago. But very few have ever heard of Sabbatai Zevi, who declared himself the Messiah in 1666. By proclaiming redemption was available through acts of sin, he amassed a following of over one million passionate believers, about half the world's Jewish population during the 17th century.Although many Rabbis at the time considered him a heretic, his fame extended far and wide. Sabbatai's adherents planned to abolish many ritualistic observances, because, according to the Talmud, holy obligations would no longer apply in the Messianic time. Fasting days became days of feasting and rejoicing. Sabbateans encouraged and practiced sexual promiscuity, adultery, incest and religious orgies.After Sabbati Zevi's death in 1676, his Kabbalist successor, Jacob Frank, expanded upon and continued his occult philosophy. Frankism, a religious movement of the 18th and 19th centuries, centered on his leadership, and his claim to be the reincarnation of the Messiah Sabbatai Zevi. He, like Zevi, would perform "strange acts" that violated traditional religious taboos, such as eating fats forbidden by Jewish dietary laws, ritual sacrifice, and promoting orgies and sexual immorality. He often slept with his followers, as well as his own daughter, while preaching a doctrine that the best way to imitate God was to cross every boundary, transgress every taboo, and mix the sacred with the profane. Hebrew University of Jerusalem Professor Gershom Scholem called Jacob Frank, "one of the most frightening phenomena in the whole of Jewish history".Jacob Frank would eventually enter into an alliance formed by Adam Weishaupt and Meyer Amshel Rothschild called the Order of the Illuminati. The objectives of this organization was to undermine the world's religions and power structures, in an effort to usher in a utopian era of global communism, which they would covertly rule by their hidden hand: the New World Order. Using secret societies, such as the Freemasons, their agenda has played itself out over the centuries, staying true to the script. The Illuminati handle opposition by a near total control of the world's media, academic opinion leaders, politicians and financiers. Still considered nothing more than theory to many, more and more people wake up each day to the possibility that this is not just a theory, but a terrifying Satanic conspiracy.

            Turn on any Hollywood movie. Pedophilia is ALWAYS there - either covered up as a silly joke (Full House) or the main theme (Back to the Future) (Stand by Me leech scene) and on and on. Sex and minors are always combined in film.

            Here’s the Judith Barsi digs. Chapter 6 and 7 (combined with current working theory) are arguably the most important as they deconstruct the murder suicide narrative. It wasn’t a murder suicide.
           </p>
           <p>
            Also look at the CPS links to pizzagate.

            I would start with the Ben Swann clip on pizzagate. It's a very fair and balanced look at it..

           <p>
            Then you will notice even he says there is stuff that he can't go into like the Instagram photos etc. So use that as a launchpad into the more disturbing shit... Once you go over that she will definitely be hooked and start opening other's eyes to it as well.

            Out of Shadows, a documentary about a stunt double who broke his pelvis and went to the specialist for pelvic reconstruction. The specialist woman told him that she’s seen lots of girls with unexplained pelvic injuries. Because she was the only one who did this special reconstruction, she’s seen every patient in the L.A. area with that issue. He starts putting the pieces together backwards, reading up on pizzagate as he goes. It’s really great for story-telling if you wanna send her home with homework.

            I guess, possibly bring in the comments links and/or some “dumb down” key info and points to set it up for her. She’s new to the information and dropping a bomb might deter her

            Here is the pizzagate wiki, it's a good starting point and summary but hasn't been updated in years. Its funny reading old posts of people denying it before the whole epstein fiasco, also the official wiki page completely ignores him.

            First mention the sexual predators in Hollywood.
           </p>
           <p>
            Then talk about how its not just adult women that are being preyed upon.
           </p>
           <p>
            Bring up Heather O’Rourke and Judith Barsi and how they were victims of the Hollywood pedo rings. Use Enty and his role in helping expose Harvey Weinstein, Kevin Spacy, Bryan Singer to establish credibility.
           </p>
           <p>
            Talk about NXIVM for examples of child sex trafficking rings that have already been busted. Bring up Keith Rainere’s ties to the Clintons.

            It all goes back to Jews and even in the Bible they talk about “passing their sons before the fire” and sacrificing their own kids to Molech. Then you have “blood libel” accusations throughout the centuries. In the modern day it’s only so much worse and they made an international industry out of it and many of the most powerful and sociopathic people in the world use people like currency, and to blackmail people or harvest their organs or get off on some sick sexual fantasy or whatever they want.
