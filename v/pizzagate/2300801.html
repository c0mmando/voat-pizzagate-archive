<p>Child porn arrest; APD concerned about potential victims</p>
<p>Anchorage Police are concerned there may be local child victims after arresting a man who owned a van with blacked-out windows and finding a document on his computer about &quot;hunting/stalking kids and the pedophile handbook&quot;.  
</p>
<p>An Anchorage man was arrested on outstanding warrants late Tuesday night, authorities say, related to child porn possession and distribution. </p>
<p>Anchorage Police spokesperson MJ Thim said 27-year-old Cody Cogley was arrested at 10:30 p.m. in the 300 block of 104th Avenue for outstanding warrants for distribution of child porn, possession of child porn, forgery and theft. He was also charged with resisting arrest. </p>
<p>Thim said the investigation started October 30 when Cogley sent &quot;child sexual exploitation videos&quot; to an undercover detective with APD\'s Cyber Crimes Unit. The Alaska Internet Crimes Against Children task force, Alaska State Troopers and the FBI served a search warrant for Cogley\'s home and found evidence of the crimes on his computer and other digital devices. </p>
<p>In the criminal complaint filed Tuesday, detectives noted finding a document on Cogley\'s computer about &quot;hunting/stalking kids&quot;, as well as a &quot;pedophile handbook&quot;. Cogley told investigators that documents were included in a &quot;pack&quot; download. </p>
<p>Thim says the documents outlined how to hunt for children-- where to find them, what ages to look for. Cogley\'s van had the windows blacked-out and all but the front seats removed, Thim says, and investigators found evidence that Cogley intended to buy a bed for the van. </p>
<p>Either police prevented what could be a serious crime, Thim says, or there are victims out there. Thim says there\'s no evidence there are victims, but after putting together all of the evidence, it appears there was intent on Cogley\'s part.</p>
<p>Now, police are putting pictures of Cogley and his van out to the public in case there are indeed victims out there. </p>
<p>At his bail hearing, Cogley was appointed a public defender. He was given a $100,000 cash appearance bond and a $10,000 performance bond. He\'s also required to have a third-party custodian, should he make bail. </p>
<p>Cogley is charged with three counts of distribution of child porn, three counts of possession of child porn, one count of forgery and one count of theft. He faces a maximum of 99 years for each of the first six counts. The forgery charge stems from counterfeit $20 bills found during a search of his home, according to the criminal complaint.</p>

            Almost a MILLION children go missing in the U.S. every year and it's a $98 BILLION INDUSTRY going on, right under our noses. They use these victims for all sorts of unspeakable things.
Tonight for example is an occult holiday and they will, sacrafice humans. Yes...for satan. They also get high off the victims' adrenochrome that secretes from the pineal gland in the brain. The more terrified the victim is before these sacraficial deaths to satan, the better the high for these creatures. 
THE WORLD IS RUN BY SATANISTS.
Whatever you could imagine, is far far worse.

            James Alefantis's Father lives up there, I believe.  Speaks Volumes.  WTH would he be doing up there of All Places?  I am betting he is in charge of something rather Sinister.   I also think we should have gone further on the Glacier Dental research.  Something that should be re-visited.

              Thank You.   If we only had more people and time.  But everyday more articles possible evidence and crimes are posted here.  Need about twice the researchers we have.  We have lost some really good ones, for a variety of reasons.  I know a few that have said they will never stop or leave.  I am one.  Not faulting those that did, they have their reasons.  I now have about 5 things I need to get back to after the holidays and three are pretty involved.  It never ends.

               I have been deeply involved for about 10 years now. I have to take breaks sometimes. The last one was a few months. But it is only so I can survive to fight more.

                I know.  You have to.  I take very little time off, only a day or two if I have to go away, but always check on my phone.  Small spurts even help.  Thanks for hanging in there so long.

            Native children are easy pickings in Alaska. Alaska has a HUGE problem with exploitation of its indigenous women and girls.  There is generational trauma, which makes it easier for them to be preyed upon.  They're more likely to be homeless and vulnerable.  There's poverty. These girls are more likely to be groomed and then trafficked.   These girls are easy targets: people are less likely to care about native girls and women being sex trafficked, pimped out and raped.
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             Native American children are overrepresented [in foster care] at a rate that is 2.7 times their rate in the general population” and as many as 40 percent of Native children and youth live in poverty. The same factors which contribute to the marginalization of Native youth in society as a whole, also contribute to their heightened vulnerability to human trafficking.
            </p>
            <p>
             Native communities also experience an additional layer of risk from intergenerational trauma patterns associated with the history of tribal relocations, boarding schools, and large-scale adoptions of Native children.  These unique historical experiences have increased the likelihood that Native women and girls will encounter situations of exploitation at some point in their lives.

             Agree. Local/State law enforcement could be in on this as well, but it could just be a weird perv. If you were into that kind of thing, would you not target an area with more children? One more thing to consider is the ratio of guns to humans. Anchorage needs women desperately per capita. Only a couple roads lead out of the State and they all go through child stealing Canada. The other route is by sea, and Anchorage has a name for a reason.

              What can be done if so much of LE view these victims as essentially worthless and a drain on society?  I've read info that LE higher ups in Canada are either directly involved and enjoying sexual favors, looking the other way due to payola, and/or at least know the identities of most of the perps.
             </p>
             <p>
              A couple of the serial murderers in SF and Northern CA were said to also be responsible for some of the victims of "the trail of tears," especially when the young women threatened to identity LE and politicians participating in their abuse at a big profit. Snuff films have documented their demise. Note those drugged and forced to participate in wild exhibitions at "pig farms," along with women prisoners who supposedly would not be missed after not returning from a brief visit to "friends" and accidentally OD'ing.

             Still researching, but from what I'm seeing, Alaska has one of the highest rates of sex crimes against children and trafficking of children in the country. There's lots of stuff I'm finding about how bad it is in Alaska, especially Anchorage, which makes sense because I think it's the biggest city there.

               Based on the reactions of so many people who responded to the news article, I think a LOT of the residents have no idea that the trafficking/raping/torturing is going on all around them.

              There's also a terribly high rate of alcoholism, genetic tendencies (not an excuse) likewise towards drug addiction, months of the year where it's really not safe to go outside due to the frozen climate combined with limited entertainment options and inconsistent TV reception.
             </p>
             <p>
              Also almost all natives get an automatic subsidy without having to work or even volunteer their services, as do many long-term AK residents. Therefore motivation for demanding physical labor battling the elements is minimal.
             </p>
             <p>
              Also everything but salmon and local seafood is extremely expensive. Meaning most have a nutritionally deficient diet and suffer the mental and physical consequences. Also note the salmon fishing and seafood industries have taken a severe hit due to Fukushima leakage. Therefore expect to see much greater frustration and general abuse of everything weaker in the future.

            Taxpayers pay to keep these sick, broken fucks in protective custody, and then eventually release these incurable sexual predators after they've 'served their time'.  This isn't a normal situation where constitutional rights fully apply, these 'people' who violently sexually abuse children need to be adjucated as a special case somehow, like enemy combatants or war criminals.
           </p>
           <p>
            Who among us has a problem with locking these child rapists up for life after a fair trial by a jury of their peers?  False accusations should be no problem, we can just do DNA tests.  It's a great time to be alive, we have a chance to really do right by these victims for once, why are we dropping the ball so often and letting people walk?

             Sadly I've encountered a few of these evil jerks in the context of acting gigs. No I was not a victim in these cases but one who knew how to fake a non-judgmental ear and sympathetic face. Yes they too were all sexually, emotionally, and physically abused when extremely, extremely young. So were others who then worked to defend victims, rather than imitating their perps. So no excuses for rotten behavior.
            </p>
            <p>
             No the perps would never get help as they'd then have to admit responsibility. So much easier for them to always blame the victim, even if he/she were an infant or a small child. If they cannot drastically and permanently change their mind set, which of course requires extreme discipline, why should they be allowed back in society?

             I was once part of a jury pool that was being selected to retain a serial child rapist past his sentence. I was rejected by his lawyer because I thought some people did not have “free will” to reject their pathological desires.

              If they don't have the "free will" to reject their pathological desires, then why didn't they volunteer to spend the rest of their lives in a mental hospital and in isolation? Would that be an adequate excuse for someone who supposedly cannot control his overwhelming desire to possess all of the super expensive jewelry in another's retail store despite his unwillingness to earn a living?

               The lawyer was trying to select a jury that thought a person through his free will could overcome his desires. He was wanting this guy to go free. He said “ I’m sure you all believe in free will”. I raised my hand and said “I don’t think so”. Anyway I wasn’t picked and I hope I ruined his defense strategy. I looked in the papers and I’m not sure of the outcome. This was before the internet.

             The thing that struck me about the comments on this article was the level of vitriol against the perp and others like him. I'm not advocating violence but it made me smile to see so many people give a shit versus the apathy that I see all around me everyday. I've been fearing for humanity but peoples' reactions to this particular child rapist gives me hope and I don't think it's a false hope.
