<p>I was an undercover security officer at Walt Disney World.... I found their darkest secret. (full story)
Good morning, I am writing this on my phone so please have patience with any grammatical or formatting errors. This post got removed originally and I messaged the mods, they said they have no idea how it happened, but I\'ve been finding small silhouettes of Mickey Mouse outside of my house. Here\'s the repost and an update is in the works.</p>
<p>To start off with, I now reside in a completely different State after leaving my job with the Walt Disney World Resort in Orlando. I used to be what one other Redditor described as a &quot;suit,&quot; I am one of the guys that walks around the park in plain sight yet hidden to the public. I am part of the elite group of black polo-sporting undercover security officers that specialize in worse things than shoplifters and unruly park guests. You see, as stated prior to this post on <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/nosleep">/r/nosleep</a>, if you are at Disney World and you more than a few guys in one place wearing black polos then you are most likely in danger and you should leave the area immediately. The sad part is we are so good at blending in with the woodwork that you wouldn\'t even notice us. Anyway let me cut to the chase here. I have seen some pretty weird things at Disney World during my time, these &quot;anomalies&quot; that everyone speaks of, well they are true but the least of our concerns. see the thing is when you take hundreds of thousands of people and cram them into a relatively small space, weird shit is going to happen. We have had kids, even adults get lost in the park, cryptozoological sightings, alien sightings, ghost sightings, and just generally unexplainable things happen all the time.</p>
<p>I was a Senior Special Security Officer during the height of my time there, and got called for some pretty dark shit. Many of you think we, as in the security detail I was in, were covering up for Disney Corp. but in our true nature we were damage control and were kept out of the loop on things and were trained not to question but to diffuse. There was one thing though that to this day still bothers me. A Cast Member called us on the Nextel to report that a group of four children had gone missing on The Land. Of course I thought, another one of those anomalies. For those of you who don\'t know the eerily calming nature ride called Living With The Land, it is located in the Land and The Sea pavilion over by Soarin\' the odd thing about this report is that we have never received one of these complaints before, and of course we are issued cover up stories to tell cast members or guests to calm them down. My colleague calmly came up with a story and explained that the kids were part of an educational program and they exited the boat with a guide and were escorted into the botany lab that exists on the ride. I told her not to ask any questions or talk about the incident as to not spread &quot;false rumors,&quot; and had my colleague escort her to a nearby security office to have her sign some forms. My human nature took over and I got curious and entered the ride on the next boat alone.</p>
<p>Living With The Land is boring and not particularly popular so I can understand how the kids would be on the boat alone and also how I could get on the boat by myself. I noticed absolutely nothing until I came to the part of the ride that has the prairie farmhouse, it looks like a faux house, but something about it just never sat right with me. As I have done hundreds of times before on rides, I jumped off the boat and onto the scene where the house is. I noticed something funny though, there were no pressure mats and the boat went away, allotting about a good 30 seconds before the next boat got to the scene. I have never seen a ride with no pressure mats to detect if anyone disembarks the ride.</p>
<p>So quick recap, kids disappear on ride, I show up and feed the Cast Member who reported it some story about how they disembarked mid ride and are on a tour of the lab and for her not to question it. Colleague of mine takes her away to debrief. I contacted the new Cast Member operating the ride and tell him to put some space between the next boat as I am looking for a lost wedding ring, bull I know but so what.</p>
<p>I slowly started to walk up to the faux house; climbing the steps up to the porch I noticed a small emblem on the left window. It\'s a small square and compass symbol, interesting that a Masonic symbol is hidden here. I figured whoever build the ride was a Freemason and brushed it off. I looked in the windows of the house and it was nothing but curtains with black plywood behind them. I thought that there was nothing to see here, but still something inside me decided that wasn\'t good enough. The front door glided open to a bright room with a black and white checkerboard floor. There was a marble alter like table on the opposite end of the room with some kind of Weird throne like chair built into the front of it and a gold cup on the table top. The only other thing that was noticeable was a heavy wooden door on the other end of the room that was locked; there were no windows or anything else. I thought I was weird because I was always under the impression that this house was fake. Human nature took over again and against my better judgment I tried the door in the room, but I was relieved that it was locked. I tried my keys but none of them work. Here\'s the thing, at Disney we use a lock system called Best, this had interchangeable cores that have assigned numbers and/or letters. This is so we can issue keys only to certain areas. I have the General Master key, which essentially is the real key to the kingdom. Interesting thing about this lock was that my master didn\'t open it. I looked closer and it was a Best Lock, but the inscription said “C.C.” on it, which I\'ve never seen before. Since the door wasn\'t open I decided to just to leave. On my way out I noticed in the floor there was a fast pass printed out for Soarin\'. I picked it up and pocketed it; it\'s amazing how trash works its way into odd places. I\'m going to figure out where these kids went.</p>
<p>I rode the boat back out to the platform and went back to the EPCOT security office to playback some footage from the DVR. It took me a while, but I zeroed in on the period where the kids entered the Land and Sea Pavilion, and followed them. There were four kids total, 3 girls and one boy. The girl’s actions were almost robotic, and it sent a chill up my spine. They walked in a straight line through the pavilion, but what scared me was there was man with them escorting them through the place. I paused and looked closer when I realized the man was wearing a black polo and kakis, the same thing I was wearing. Holy shit, I even recognized him, it was one of my colleagues.</p>
<p>Allen is the guy that was at the scene before I got there, the same guy who fed the Cast Member at the control podium the bullshit about the kids going on a tour. I thought maybe he did actually send them on the tour of the Botanic lab and lost track of them, until I hit play on the film. The boy was not walking in line and I could tell he was giving Allen problems, he keeps venturing away and getting distracted various things in the Pavilion. The benefit of the doubt I gave Allen subsided when I say the kid go press the button for the Fast Pass on Soarin’ and take the paper Fast Pass almost like a prize. Allen then tugged him away and stood back and observed as the kids walked to Living With The Land. I saw them get on the boat. I saw them through the storm scene, through the rain forest scene, then through the desert scene. After the desert I lost the boat on camera. The ride stopped momentarily, you could see it on the other scenes, and once it resumes I saw the boat again in the scene with the pictures of farmers. The boat was empty. I also saw freakin’ Allen looking down off of the observation deck… which explains how he responded so quickly. I switched the cameras back to live view and left that area. I haven’t been exactly honest with you thus far, I know a lot of things of what Disney does and things that we respond to that a regular security officer wouldn’t deal with. I have seen them experiment so many things such as eugenics, pharmaceutical engineering, even experimenting with gas. Have you ever noticed that on both Space Ship Earth and the Monorail that you get a strange calm feeling on those rides? Well they are pumping low doses of laughing gas in those areas. Ever heard of Room 0? They were wearing gas masks for a reason. Ever hear of Gascots? Well that’s not important right now, I would encourage you to research it. I never thought that what we did was okay by containing these dark secrets, but it paid well. I have seen them quickly inject some experimental drug on guests and throws them back out there, our job was to monitor and contain them if things went haywire. I know that I am the bad guy, but this wasn’t normal, this wasn’t procedural.</p>
<p>First thing I did was go over to the room where we keep the keys; I looked through the logbooks for the core labeled “C.C.” I found it but it had no zone or specific location issued to the core and the number of copies was marked as 1. This key was in our system but my Master Key didn’t open it. I grabbed the “Core Key” and a few Zone 1 Cores, The Core Key is a specific key that when inserted into the lock will remove the core so it can be replaced with another. I put this in my pocket and make a beeline for the Land and Sea Pavilion. I may be paranoid but I swear I saw Allen following me in the shadows.</p>

            I agree. The authenticity of this is cray. The part where the guy has the gun and says "you shouldn't have come here" sounded like a movie. But I will say after watching some youtube videos of the ride itself, that house is creepy af.

            This seems pretty LARPy to me. It's written like a wanna be novelist produced it. Were the kids reported missing by parents? Police report? If not, we're going to have to treat this as an uncorroborated "personal testimony" thread -- which we routinely give the "Unverified" flair.

            OK, I don't know what to make of this.  My first opinion is that it is pretty hokey.  Now that doesn't mean I don't think there are some strange and nefarious things going on inside of the Disney Parks.  He mentions Gascots and I looked at a few sites and this is the least bazaar looking one.

            Hmm.  Some of this sounds hokey too.  My tendency is to not believe this story.  Let me tell you one thing that occurred to me.  If he actually saw what he says, imo He would not be alive.

            I got to the ride and got to the house and back in the front door to the Masonic Room, and locked the front door as I entered. I inserted the Core Key into the lock on the wooden door, removed the core, and inserted the Zone 1 core into the lock. Now my Master Key will open the door, and boy did it. The door glided open, it was heavy and steel on the other side of the wood face. There was a velvet red carpeted staircase leading down to some kind of utilidor, but we are in EPCOT, what the hell. There is one small utilidor in EPCOT, but it doesn’t go this deep. I descended the stairs and walked down the red-carpeted hallway to these two double doors. Behind these doors was my answer and the truth as to what happened to these kids. Through these doors was the darkest side of Disney, a side of Disney that even I couldn’t believe. Would Walt be in favor of this? Or is this one of Eisner’s little idea of making more money off his guests.
           </p>
           <p>
            Behind these doors was an empty dimly lit room with a small circular platform in the center. The carpet was the same lush red velvet carpet from the hallway. There were 6 leather armchairs around the circular platform, all with telephones and card readers on the table next to the chair. Inside I knew what was going on, I knew what was happening here. This is one thing I will not cover up for the Disney Corp. I stood there in disbelief and horror and noticed a small door towards the back of the room. I went over and popped out the “C.C.” core, put it in my pocket, and put in a Zone 1 Core. I heard someone clear their throat from the front of the room. It was Allen, he had an annoyed look on his face and held a gun trained at me. I slowly propped the door open on the latch and turned to face him.
           </p>
           <p>
            “You never should have come here.” He said to me when he was stepping towards me.
           </p>
           <p>
            “So this is what you and your scumbag friends resorted to? We did some pretty fucked up shit Allen, but this is a new low for you and your disgusting friends.” I had my hand at my side and blocked the view of me slipping the Zone 1 Core out of the handle, and into my pocket.
           </p>
           <p>
            “It’s not going to matter because no one is going to find out.” He raised the gun and like something out of an action movie I ripped the door open as he pulled the trigger as a bullet hit the door. I jumped backwards through the doorway and shut it behind me. That asshole was stuck because I had both cores in my pocket so there was no way he could open the door. He started shooting the door, and I moved forward. I walked down a hallway with these small cell-like rooms lining the hall and inside were those playschool chairs and a few toys. I checked every one of them and they were all empty. I got to the end of the hall and there was this huge metal vault like door, I popped the last Zone 1 core into the door to replace the “C.C.” core and pulled the steel door open to be hit in the face with sunlight. I was outside on some side utility road off premises of EPCOT. The road led away, I was too late they were already gone for good.
           </p>
           <p>
            I called the police but they never came, I called the FBI but they never took me seriously, hell I even called the CIA but they said they didn’t deal with domestic issues like that and referred me back to the FBI. I showed up at the Orange County police department HQ and they took a report but I heard something fall in the trash when I was leaving. Disney is good at what they do, they are good at keeping secrets, and they are good at controlling any outside force that attempts to bring their secrets to light. I am lucky I saw the sunlight again, and am lucky to have had time to leave the State before they got to me. If you go there, please keep your kids close. Watch out for the guys in the black polos. They may be monitoring you, they may be responding to something that will put you in danger. As far as I know, they aren’t the ones that pick out the merchandise… I don’t even know who does that.

            The second story of the house is seemingly normal, but I don't know how they access it. You'll also notice that there is an observation deck; this area was undergoing "maintenance" at the time. It was closed off to guests, but CCTV footage revealed nothing was happening in that area. The camera points back onto the observation area and not at the house, there are no cameras in that portion of the ride.
