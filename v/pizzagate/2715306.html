<p>“BERLIN (AP) - <strong>A report on sexual abuse inside the Catholic Church in Germany says 3,677 people were abused by clergy between 1946 and 2014</strong>, two leading German media outlets said Wednesday.</p>

<p>The report also says that <strong>the actual number of victims was likely much higher</strong>, according to the research by experts from the Universities of Giessen, Heidelberg and Mannheim.</p>
<p><strong>The German Bishops Conference said in a written response a few hours later that it regretted the leaking of the report, but that the study confirms &quot;the extent of the sexual abuse&quot; that took place.</strong></p>
<p>&quot;It is depressing and shameful for us,&quot; Bishop Stephan Ackermann said. He didn\'t further elaborate on the findings of the report, but said the Catholic group would present the study as initially planned on Sept. 25 together with the authors.</p>
<p>Die Zeit wrote that researchers weren\'t allowed to look at the original church files but had to provide questionnaires to the dioceses, which then provided the information.</p>
<p>In their conclusions, the researchers write that <strong>there was evidence that some files were manipulated or destroyed, many cases were not brought to justice, and that sometimes abuse suspects - primarily priests - were simply moved to other dioceses without the congregations being informed about their past</strong>.</p>
<p>The Catholic Church has been struggling with sex abuse by its clergy for a long time.</p>
<p><strong>In 2010, the German church was roiled by a sex abuse scandal triggered by the head of a Jesuit school in Berlin who went public about decades-long sexual abuse of high school students by clergy.

<p>An investigation in the United States last month found rampant sexual abuse of more than 1,000 children by about 300 Catholic priests in Pennsylvania.</p>
<p><strong>Earlier this week, the Vatican said it is preparing the &quot;necessary clarifications&quot; about accusations that top Vatican officials including Pope Francis covered up the sexual misconduct of a now-disgraced American ex-cardinal.</strong></p>
<p>Also <strong>on Wednesday, the Vatican said it\'s summoning the presidents of every bishops conference around the world for a February summit</strong> to discuss preventing clergy sex abuse and protecting children.”</p>',

            From Der Spiegel:
           </p>
           <p>
            Sexual offenses committed in religious communities - such as the Canisius College or the Benedictine Gymnasium Ettal - have not been included in the report. The same applies to incidents in children's homes run by the church or attacks by church pastors in non-church institutions. The 500 victims of physical and sexual violence at the Regensburger Domspatzen were also excluded.

             Nice addition--thanks.  When an entity investigates itself for wrongdoing, you can always be sure you're not getting everything in the final report.

              They are still hiding plenty.  They are hoping they can get away with hiding the SRA.  That is the Stunner in the Grand Jury that did not get reported.  Someone I know told me she was not allowed to be interviewed because her case would have fallen under SRA.  That is what they are working like mad to avoid.  If those stories ever come out - Katie Barr the Door.

            Hahahaha. Brilliant! So this was pre-selected stuff? Everything that would actually have been a bombshell was left out?
           </p>
           <p>
            Like info about ritual abuse, info about abuse by bishops, pedophile rings in the church etc.?
           </p>
           <p>
            Or how do they justify the 'pre-selection'?
           </p>
           <p>
            On a side note, even Snopes now confirmes there are pedophile rings in the Catholic Church!

             The testimonies of victims whose records were found to be "manipulated or destroyed" should be given special attention because, as you point out, those are likely to be the most egregious of crimes and/or committed by the highest-ranking perverts.
