<p>JFK jr knew who was responsible and stated he would avenge his fathers death by naming who was responsible. He then created a magazine and named it GEORGE....he would not answer to why he chose that name. He then ran for Senator of New York and HRC entered the race against him even though she was exiting the Whitehouse as First Lady and had no residence in New York to qualify her to run. JFK jr was the sure winner but SHOCKINGLY his airplane crashed killing him and the only two confidantes he had. Just in the nick of time for Hillary Clinton to win the Senate race.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So, there is much dispute about whether JFK Jr. actually really intended to run for office at that point but the story behind his magazine George is intriguing.  Starting with the first issue.  I had a look at the cover: <a href="https://imgur.com/a/yFM2XJ9">https://imgur.com/a/yFM2XJ9</a></p>
<p>Notice the article <em>Dodging bullets with the FBI\'s Louis Freeh</em>. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louis_Freeh">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louis_Freeh</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>A notable case Freeh was associated with was the <strong>&quot;Pizza Connection&quot; investigation</strong>, in which he was lead prosecutor. The case, prosecuted in the mid-1980s, involved a drug trafficking operation in the United States by <strong>Sicilian organized crime members</strong> who used pizza parlors as fronts. After a 14-month trial, 16 of 17 co-defendants were convicted. The &quot;Pizza Connection&quot; case was, at the time, the most complex criminal investigation ever undertaken by the U.S. government.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>voat post:  <a href="https://voat.co/v/QRV/2904958">Former FBI Director Louis Freeh compares Investigating Clintons to when he Investigated Organized Crime</a> .. interesting that the trial he refers to is known as the Pizza Connection.</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pizza_Connection_Trial">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pizza_Connection_Trial</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The trial centered on a Mafia-run enterprise that distributed vast quantities of heroin and cocaine in the United States, and then laundered the cash before sending it back to the suppliers in Sicily. The U.S. defendants utilized a number of independently owned pizza parlors as fronts for narcotics sales and collections – hence the name &quot;Pizza Connection&quot;. Evidence at the trial proved that the enterprise shipped no less than $1.6 billion of heroin to the U.S. between 1975 and April 1984. Arrests of scores of conspirators were coordinated in the U.S., Italy, Switzerland and Spain on April 9, 1984, following the capture of Gaetano Badalamenti and several family members the previous day in Madrid, Spain. Badalamenti was the former boss of the Sicilian Mafia, and a key supplier of heroin and cocaine to the U.S. Mafia distributors.</p>

<p>We\'ve certainly done a lot of work on pizzerias but not enough on the restaurant business as a whole perhaps. Think about that recent death of celebrity chef Anthony Bourdain.</p>
<p>More about that Pizza Connection Trial:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Carla Del Ponte</strong> and Paolo Bernasconi were prosecutors in the Ticino region of Switzerland, where members of the Pizza Connection used bank accounts to launder narcotics proceeds. Relying on the U.S./Swiss Treaty for Mutual Legal Assistance, Del Ponte and her colleague Paolo Bernasconi authorized the delivery of those bank records to the U.S. authorities, and later supervised the prosecution of the 4 defendants arrested in Switzerland. Paolo Bernasconi was promoted to the position of Attorney General of Switzerland, and Ms. Del Ponte succeeded him in that position when he returned to the private practice of law. In 1999 Ms. Del Ponte joined the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (&quot;ICTY&quot;) where she served as the chief prosecutor in the trial of Slobodan Milosevic, and the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda (&quot;ICTR&quot;). She has been Switzerland\'s Ambassador to Argentina since January 2008.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So, we have a few posts about Carla including this one from <a href="https://voat.co/u/Carmencita">@Carmencita</a> :  <a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/2622784">Kosovo PM Like Mafia Boss - Child Organ Trafficking &amp; Arms-Clinton Ties</a></p>

<p>So, knowing we\'ve already posted about Hillary Clinton\'s family mob connections, I thought I\'d google the Sicilian mob.. and the first result is to this Daily Mail article: EXCLUSIVE: <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3351235/Hillary-Clinton-s-ties-MOB-former-Secretary-State-met-Mafia-heir-pizzeria-asked-father-s-release-prison-return-offer-couldn-t-refuse.html">Hillary Clinton\'s ties to the MOB: How former Secretary of State met with Mafia heir at his pizzeria where he asked for father\'s release from prison (in return for an offer she couldn\'t refuse)</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The former First Lady met Giovanni Gambino, the son of Francesco \'Ciccio\' Gambino and the cousin of Carlo Gambino - the boss of the notorious crime family and one-time head of the American Mafia - while she was campaigning in the the presidential primary in 2007.</p>
<p>The Democratic front runner spoke to the crime author, who recently made headlines for saying he would protect New York from ISIS, at one of his <strong>pizzerias in Charleston, South Carolina</strong>. The 41-year-old\'s father, who was serving a 30-year prison sentence at the time, suggested he contact  Clinton to see if she could help with his early release through a presidential pardon.</p>
<p>In return, Giovanni Gambino would get his \'connections\' in the restaurant business to vote for her and drum up support.

            “I will splinter the CIA into a thousand pieces and scatter it into the wind." —John F. Kennedy
           </p>
           <p>
            Why was John F. Kennedy so adamant about abolishing the Central Intelligence Agency?
           </p>
           <p>
            History shows that shortly after he made this statement, he was assassinated on the streets of Dallas, Texas on November 22, 1963.
           </p>
           <p>
            Most Americans are also aware that after the assassination President Johnson reversed President Kennedy’s orders on Vietnam while conveniently appointing former CIA director Allen Dulles, who was fired by President John F. Kennedy for lying and manipulating when it came to the “Bay of Pigs,” as the fox in the chicken coop to the “Warren Commission” to investigate John F. Kennedy’s assassination (Jeremiah 11:9).
           </p>
           <p>
            The rest is history. The truth fell in the streets the day (Isaiah 59:14) that the American people refused to deal with those who were responsible for the murder of their president.     Video Incl.
           </p>
           <p>
            “CIA's primary mission is to collect, analyze, evaluate, and disseminate foreign intelligence to assist the President and senior US government policymakers in making decisions relating to national security.”
           </p>
           <p>
            If you believe this, then you deserve what you have got coming.
           </p>
           <p>
            What they say that they do and what they actually are doing are two different stories. The fruit of the CIA has been war, world destabilization, media propaganda, murder, bribery, etc. … Listen to former CIA agent John Stockwell.
           </p>
           <p>
            “It is the function of the CIA to keep the world to keep the world unstable, and to propagandize the American people to hate, so we will let the establishment spend any amount of money on arms....”
           </p>
           <p>
            Of course, they have been in cahoots with the military industrial complex, which President Eisenhower warned Americans about back in January 17, 1961. [YouTube Video]
           </p>
           <p>
            The CIA has become a propaganda outlet.
           </p>
           <p>
            We can see what former CIA director William Casey said when reinforcing what John Stockwell stated,
           </p>
           <p>
            “We'll know our disinformation program is complete when everything the American people believe is false.” -William Casey, CIA Director, 1981
           </p>
           <p>
            (Short Operation Mockingbird Video here)
           </p>
           <p>
            Is the CIA alive and well concerning their crimes?
           </p>
           <p>
            On February 1, 2017, the CIA popped its ugly head up once again. This time they were exposed for fake news about an assassination attempt on the Syrian leader, Bashar Assad.
            <a href="https://sonsoflibertymedia.com/fake-news-syrian-leader-planted-cia-assad-stroke-assassination-attempt/">
             https://sonsoflibertymedia.com/fake-news-syrian-leader-planted-cia-assad-stroke-assassination-attempt/
            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            When are the American people going to hold accountable not only corrupt politicians who are using the media as a cover for their crimes, but also those who are behind the crimes? (Deuteronomy 4:1)
           </p>
           <p>
            Remember that Adolph Hitler’s third Reich was “made on propaganda,” according to Joseph Goebbels.
           </p>
           <p>
            Who does propaganda work best on? The least intelligent (Hosea 4:6) said none other than the devil incarnate, Adolph Hitler.
           </p>
           <p>
            “All propaganda has to be popular and has to accommodate itself to the comprehension of the least intelligent of those whom it seeks to reach.”
           </p>
           <p>
            It has been said that not everything that is faced can be changed, but nothing can be changed until it is faced.
           </p>
           <p>
            Until the American people understand what they are allowing through the likes of the CIA and other bureaucracies, nothing will change.
           </p>
           <p>
            “I never would have agreed to the formulation of the Central Intelligence Agency back in forty-seven, if I had known it would become the American Gestapo.” –President Harry Truman.
           </p>
           <p>
            America, it would be wisdom on our part to finish what President Kennedy intended to do with the CIA.

             WHEREAS by an Ordinance of the Lords and Commons, now assembled in Parliament, bearing Date the Second Day of November, Anno Domini 1643, Robert Earl of Warwick, is constituted, and ordained Governor in Chief, and Lord High Admiral of all those Islands and other Plantations inhabited or planted by, or belonging to any His Majesty the King of England's subjects, (or which hereafter may be inhabited and planted by, or belonging to them,) within the Bounds, and upon the Coasts of America. And whereas the said Lords have thought fit, and thereby ordained, that Philip Earl of Pembroke, Edward Earl of Manchester, William Viscount Say and Seal, Philip Lord Wharton, John Lord:Rolle, Members of the House of Peers. Sir Gilbert Gerrard, Baronet, Sir Arthur Haslerig, Baronet, Sir Henry Vane, jun. Knight, Sir Benjamin Rudyard, Knight, John Pim,

             , Dennis Bond, Miles Corbet, Cornelius Holland, Samuel Vassal, John Rolle, and William Spurstow, Esqrs, Members of the House of Commons, should be Commissioners, to join in Aid and Assistance with the said Earl. And whereas for the better Government and Defence, it is thereby ordained, that the aforesaid Governor and Commissioners, or the greater Number of them, shall have Power and Authority from Time to Time to nominate, appoint, and constitute all such subordinate Governors, Counsellors, Commanders, Officers, and Agents, as they shall judge to be best affected, and most fit and serviceable for the said Islands and Plantations; and to provide for, order and dispose all Things, which they shall, from Time to Time, find most advantageous for the said Plantations; and for the better Security of the Owners and Inhabitants thereof, to assign, ratify, and confirm, so much of their afore-mentioned Authority and Power, and in such Manner, and to such Persons as they shall judge to be fit for the better governing and preserving of the said Plantations and Islands, from open Violences and Private Disturbances and Distractions. And whereas there is a Tract of Land in the Continent of America aforesaid, called by the Name of the Narraganset-Bay; bordering Northward and Northeast on the Patent of the Massachusetts, East and Southeast on Plymouth Patent, South on the Ocean, and on the West and Northwest by the Indians called Nahigganneucks, alias Narragansets; the whole Tract extending about Twenty-five English Miles unto the Pequot River and Country.

             And whereas divers well affected and industrious English Inhabitants, of the Towns of Providence, Portsmouth, and Newport in the tract aforesaid, have adventured to make a nearer neighborhood and Society with the great Body of the Narragansets, which may in time by the blessing of God upon their Endeavours, lay a sure foundation of Happiness to all America. And have also purchased, and are purchasing of and amongst the said Natives, some other Places, which may be convenient both for Plantations, and also for building of Ships Supply of Pipe Staves and other Merchandize...

             Donald Trump met the Gambino crime family boss (at that time) Paul Castellano and “Fat Tony” Salerno through Roy Cohn (when I say met.. I havent seen pictures of them together) and Trump made an offer to  S &amp; A Concrete (owned by Castellano and Salerno) that they didnt want to refuse, in order to build Trump Plaza.  (If the wall goes up.. ask if its readymade concrete.. Mafia had the control of that market..)

She recently published an autobiography, she is a former porn model, who owned the world largest collection of porn pics. She produced sex ads for the Gambinos IIRC. Going to do a post about her and John of God, and her porn background.

             ...Charleston is an ancient city with a dark hidden past, but beautiful on the outside. Its first colonists' roots go back to Elizabeth l and the sugar barons of Barbados, some who were early investors in the English East India Company. Charleston was essentially their colony, supplying food and goods to the island because every square inch was planted in sugar cane, WHITE GOLD. The swampy waters of Charleston's coast proved ideal for growing rice. Some of Charleston's early fortunes were made from growing Carolina Gold rice. These were industrial scale plantations, and the beginnings of the triangle trade, using African enslaved workers and became the economic engine for Colonial America. History books tend to downplay this. South Carolina's "barons" were a very powerful force in the early economic and political history of America- more so than the Northern colonies at that time. Much of their early history was removed from history books after the Civil War. I believe Freemasonry was practiced there from the earliest times, many colonists being of Scottish and Anglo/Welsh descent. In early Colonial South Carolina, the Church of England dominated.

           <blockquote>
            <p>
             When King Charles I’s head fell off the chopping block on January 30, 1649, the Interregnum began.  Under the leadership of Lord Protector Oliver Cromwell, the Commonwealth period would last eleven years.
            </p>
            <p>
             ... However, many were divided about the return of Jews to London and it only added to the common people’s distaste for Cromwell and his government.  Both came to an end by 1660.  Cromwell himself died in 1658 and his son took over as Lord Protector, but proved to be unsuited for leadership and resigned in 1660.  This permitted the request of Parliament for King Charles II to return and assume the throne once more.  The beginning of the Restoration period was celebrated by more than 20,000 Londoners who came out into the streets to celebrate the king’s return.  Cromwell, who had been buried in Westminster Abbey, was dug up and posthumously tried and executed for his crimes against the Crown.  At least, the English Civil War and the dark period of the Interregnum was over for London and a new period could begin.
