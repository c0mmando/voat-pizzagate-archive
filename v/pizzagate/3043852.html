            Not just celibate lifestyle....they also teach masturbation is a venal sin and pedophilia is a mistake. Think it used to be more serious than venal. So perverted . So satanic....So sheep like...

            I have an old Random House dictionary and the very first definition it gives for celibacy is "the state of being unmarried".  Apparently the definition was changed over time.

            Celibacy.. what a joke..  The suppression of natural urges only leads to perveersion and extremism.  This hypocricy of celibat.. Popes have made Nunneries into prostitutes brothels after being impressed by Royal brothals in France.  Popes even used prostitutes to interest men into marrying and reproducing because populations were dropping. Religion has always been associated to sex.  Celibat has no place in religion.  Maybe then, they'd leave the vunerable children alone..

             I wouldn’t say it has no place in Christianity. Jesus, John the Baptist, Apostle Paul never married. Paul said it was good not to touch a woman. Some men can handle it for the gospel but it should be a personal choice, not a requirement for church leadership.

              Jesus and John didnt marry because they were both killed (if you take the bible as gospel :)).  Paul didnt marry as he was a zealot, a man on a mission.. Tarsus was a centre of Mithraism in Saul's time.
If Paul said it was good not to touch a woman, he may have been gay? 
Chastity for a period of time can be good for certain reasons, but as usual, idiots in charge of churches dont understand why they're doing it and make a guideline into a dogma, even worse, these buffons have executive power and make it into a law.

              Christianity was adopted by an Emperor because he cas copying the satrap system.

            You were right about perverting their sexual urges.  They might not realize they are perverting their sexual urges, but we have known since the 60's that sexual urges are controlled in the same way as one trains animals through behaviorism.  Through application of behaviorism, scientists have taught subjects how to become sexually aroused to geometric shapes.  If you can be aroused by looking at a parallelogram, you can train yourself to be aroused by ANYthing.  Suppressing your natural sexual urges leads to perversions of all sorts.  Children...animals...anything.

             Totally right. This is why NAMBLA exists. To create future perverts. People with urges such as Milo are not born that way. I like Milo but he basically comes right out and says where he got his homosexual tendencies from.

            I know I'm gonna be attacked for that. But why is there a place for this under Pizzagate? While Catholic Church hiding sexual abuse of children is just as disgusting as uncovered sickness of pedophilia in Washington DC, I can't find any connection of Catholic Church with liberal Washington DC elites and everything that's connected to them. There are many distractions from Pizzagate which is really about Washington DC elite, especially connected to previous government, but most likely connected to media and some powerful figures whom we can still call elite. This is one of such distractions, if anyone can link Catholic Church abuse to John Podesta, Tony Podesta, Hillary Clinton, Barack Obama and their good friend - James Alefantis, then I'll be glad. But there's no such link and connection.
           </p>
           <p>
            And who knows maybe even republicans are into this if Fox News is defending James Alefantis.

             The connection , and the reason this post is here. ...the catholic church, US , Europe and UK have sanctioned pedophilia...one of the bulwarks of their entire govt. corruption.i.e. longer sentences for marijuana possession than known serial pedophilia.

              I would like to have a proof. Catholic Church is not only speaking against pedophilia, euthanasia and abortion, but also against homosexualism and freemasons. While liberal anti-Catholic elites of Europe accepted existence of pedophilia oriented political party. And there are similar forces within United States, just look at this Desmond, 11 year old drag queen.

               I don't know if you've seen this before, or not, but it's a starting point for proof:

              </p>
              <p>
               Saying one thing and doing another is standard procedure amongst all these people. Politicians frequently do it - with all the stories coming out about the catholic church, why would you just take their word for it?
              </p>
              <p>
               As the author in the article above points out, it's accepted "culture" that the more outspoken a priest is on the issue of homosexuality, the more likely he is to be gay.
              </p>
              <p>
               I believe I see the distinction you're making though, with the pizzagate issue. Pizzagate (I assume) is properly just a small segment of the larger pedoslave/sacrifice world that is connected to the Weiner laptop. I personally believe the same problems exist within the catholic church, on the same scale, and yet, they are not implicated by the contents of the pizzagate files. So therefore, separate issue.
              </p>
              <p>
               Is that fair to your reasoning?

             The churches getting corrupted is why the rest of society was able to get corrupted. The root cause of pizzagate lies with the churches. That is how it is connected and it is indeed connected!!!

              No connection whatsoever, no further proofs whatsoever. I will remind you that Pizzagate exists only because of Podesta emails and then "someone" found connection to Comet Ping Pong, James Alefantis and then his Instagram activity, his friends, and other activity. And you're spreading now bullshit that root cause of pizzagate lies with the churches. I'll remind you again that Pizzagate has occultist and satanic aspect to it and it's showing to us CHILD TRAFFICKING RING and the head of snake is based in Washington DC. In addition to that - Catholic Church is NOT child trafficking ring, there are many pedophiles in Catholic Church, but they're not creating child trafficking ring as a whole but it's completely other phenomena which should be explained in context of celibate, in context of simply trying to protect good name of institution and then liberal media exaggerating scope of this.
             </p>
             <p>
              You're BLIND AS HELL If you can't see that you can publish any shit about Catholic Church in liberal media and you cannot publish anything about John Podesta, Tony Podesta, James Alefantis and his strange friends without calling it FAKE NEWS ( including former Department of Justice (Arun Rao) guy who often liked photos of children along with Alefantis, DC Police Chief ( Peter Newsham ) who mishandled 11 year old girl rape case, and this strange Justin Barrows who literally posses children, is seen on one picture with Alefantis and very possibly John Podesta, who also shows book "Lolita" from Vladimir Nabokov which is ... well ... about sexual attraction to children.
             </p>
             <p>
              Catholic Church is completely different thing and it should prosecute child offenders, not simply take them out of one church and move to other. But it's not child trafficking ring, it has it problems but there's no proof whatsoever for them being trafficking mafia.
             </p>
             <p>
              Pizzagate on the other hand is showing to us child sex trafficking ring which is very well connected ( and we have proofs for that ) to United States elite.

                I can't find connections like this. Maybe some actors within Catholic Church, especially in US, are indeed connected to this Washington DC pedophilia ring, but it's not a whole Church. And remember what is Pizzagate and which facts, persons and locations are central to it - Head of snake lies in Washington DC.

             Satanism and occult practices run deep in the Catholic church just as much as pedophilia. You think they are not involved in pedophilia in DC area?

              Doesn't work in my country. Do you have a proof for satanism and occultism in Catholic Church? Because if you know Pizzagate good and you know strange facts surrounding John, Tony Podesta, James Alefantis, Hillary Clinton and their connections then you'll know for sure that they are into occult things. And what's proof for Catholic Church being into this kind of stuff? Some article? Because with guys mentioned before we have seriously THE BEST PROOF EVER BRING TO THE TABLE.

               Do you have a proof for satanism and occultism in Catholic Church?  - Heisenberg123

               Heisenberg - very sorry as I am thinking that you may be catholic and you may not even realize the ties they have with satanism / luciferianism / occult practice.    It goes way back.    Here is a DVD  === but you have to pay for it === that talks about it from a former satanist

                Focus on proved huge child trafficking ring in United States. You have proof in your hands. As for Catholic Church - they're making mistakes, many mistakes, HUGE mistakes, but their doctrine is right. Do you know what is doctrine of disbelieving satanists and atheists tied to proved ( Pizzagate ) child trafficking ring mostly based in United States where its biggest beneficiaries are living? Their doctrine is - there is no God, live as you wish, realize your darkest fantasies. Their doctrine is coming straight from Satan.

                Big media will always allow you to talk shit about Catholic Church. Wouldn't they? But how about YOUR politicians, YOUR businessmans, your BANKERS, your BILLIONAIRES. Will they allow you to talk badly about them? Or they will label it as FAKE NEWS?

               Good Nazi Name!!!! The churches are sacrificing children left and right. Just because no politicians are involved doesn’t mean it is not pizzagate. Oh yes and the fact that all these policians that are involved with pizzagate go to fake churches and call themselves Christian needs to be examined too. Every time a boy is raped by a catholic priest it is a satanic ritual. Pizzagate is satanic people sacrificing children. The satanic sacrifices happen in churches (that is the number one place, Washington DC, Hollywood, and everywhere. Stop trying to define pizzagate just to Comet Ping Pong.

                Show me at least a hint and something very suspicious about Catholic Church that may be leading to fact that they're Satanic and they're sacrificing children. Lol. Plenty of such "hints" and "leaks" that lead me to believe that US liberal elite are into this, but I can't see anything that could lead me to believe that Catholic Church is part of this - they have very different problem indeed, but it's not part of CHILD SEX SLAVE TRAFFICKING RING connected to powerful US elites. I'm not defining pizzagate just to Comet Ping Pong, it's obviously their biggest soft spot along with Podesta emails, elites are probably broader than this. Pizzagate is defined by Podesta emails and Comet Ping Pong and their connections with previous US government and even current media and politics elite ( mostly democrat ), just swallow the truth.

                 History of the Jesuits From the Book "THE HISTORY OF GERMANY" by Wolfgang Menzel [In four volumes. This quote is From Volume 3 pg 1072. Book not dated but was written in the late 1800's. Menzel, Wolfgang, 1798-1873]
                </p>
                <p>
                 "The Society of Jesus was founded by Ignatius Loyola, an enthusiastic Spaniard, for penitents, who, in those heretical times, ere long made it their business to confirm the faith of the wavering, and, consequently, became the tools of Rome. Benedict XIV, named them St. Peter's Janissaries.
                </p>
                <p>
                 Their object was the restoration of unlimited hierarchical power, and they despised no means, however base, that might conduce to success, according to their celebrated maxim, "The end justifies the means."
                </p>
                <p>
                 The society was intended to form an aristocracy of talent, whose office it was to guard the avenues of knowledge against the rest of mankind; and, as a precaution against individual treachery, no member was permitted to quit the order except to take the vows of a Carthusian, by which he bound himself to silence and solitude for the rest of his days.
                </p>
                <p>
                 The heads of the society had unlimited power to remove, punish, and assassinate the members. The first vow taken by the initiated was that of unconditional obedience. A system of secret espionage pervaded the whole society; suspicion was condemnation; and the victim was sentenced to die in seclusion of starvation, as it expressly directed by Suarez, the great Jesuitical casuist.
                </p>
                <p>
                 The members were divided into classes, the highest of which, the professors, elected the head or general of the whole order, who resided at Rome. Every province of the order was under the superintendence of a pater provincialis. The higher grades were kept strictly secret from the lower classes, who were merely the blind tools of the former.  The pope conferred the most extensive privileges upon the order, which was empowered to interfere everywhere with the clergy and with all other orders. -- And, in order to renew the times of the first apostles, the Jesuits sent out missionaries, who visited the most distant parts of the globe, for the purpose of converting the heathen and --- of taking possession of the New World.  They brought countless treasure into Europe, by means of which they placed themselves on a firm footing and acquired immense influence at a period when money was power.
                </p>
                <p>
                 The most celebrated of these missionaries was St. Xavier, who met with a martyr's death in India. Numbers of the Jesuits shared the same fate; many, in particular Germans, were distinguished for piety and learning and by their exploration of unknown countries. Among the European Jesuits were many fervent spirits actuated by the purest zeal; many simple and poetical minds unstained by hypocrisy, for instance, Balde; many deeply learned men, sincere lovers of truth.
                </p>
                <p>
                 It would be unjust to pass a sweeping condemnation upon all the Jesuits.  But the ruling spirit and the political effect of the order were immoral.
                </p>
                <p>
                 The manner in which they denied the truths brought to light during the Reformation, sought to veil them by bringing to view the weaknesses and errors of Protestantism, or to suppress them by force, cannot be justified.
                </p>
                <p>
                 The sophistry with which they still defended undeniable and long-sensible abuses was revolting to reason.  The means by which they bent the powerful and wealthy to their purposes were often the most unholy.
                </p>
                <p>
                 pg1074
One of the principle objects of the Jesuits was to replace the sale of dispensations, which had fallen into bad repute since the Reformation, and which was, moreover, almost indispensable to the church. This was done by means of the lax morality of the confessional.  The more luxurious court life became, the more easily did the Jesuits forgive the sins committed by the aristocracy;  in order to pacify the new conscientious scruples awakened by the Reformation, they became the advocates instead of the judges of sins, from every description of which they, by their casuistry, exculpated the offender.
                </p>
                <p>
                 The Spanish Jesuits went furthest. The book of Escobar, the confessor's manual, passed through thirty-six editions, which were printed under the direction of the society and of the church.  The church closed her eyes to any measures taken by the confessors, provided they made proselytes and gathered the stray sheep into the fold.
                </p>
                <p>
                 According to their casuistical system, all sins were exculpated: First, by the doctrine of probabilismus, that is, by the mildest of all possible interpretations.
                </p>
                <p>
                 A says, "Sich a sin is too horrible to be forgiven."  B says, "Certainly; still it might thus be exculpated, " etc. etc.  Upon this C says, "According to A's opinion it cannot be forgiven; but it can be according to B's; and as an authority is all that is requisite, and the mildest point of view is admissible, I agree with B." 
Secondly, By the directio intentionis, that is, by the thoughts being occupied during the performance of a bad action with an innocent object. Thus, for instance, one might bribe another or accept of a bribe and, at the same time, be merely thinking of civility or gratitude.
                </p>
                <p>
                 Thirdly, By the reservatio mentalis. It was allowable to take a false oath by voluntarily adding a mental reservation, as, for instance, a man might swear he had no money, although he had some, provided he mentally added "none to lend," etc.   One might take an oath thus, "I swear (that I say here, although it is untrue) that I, " etc. or "I swear that I did not do that (a hundred years ago or a hundred miles hence), " or " I swear to do so (if I cannot think of something else)."

                 Senior Jesuits are effectively Luciferians. Same goes for senior anything these days, it seems - Freemasons, etc etc. So there's your occult connection.

                 A quick google search yielded this blog post - there's a lot more - better quality - information to be found once you go down the rabbit hole on this one.

                 Ultimately though, you will find that the three sovereign cities - Vatican, London, and Washinton DC are three heads of the same cooperating entity. Vatican - spiritual, London - financial, Washington DC - military. Luciferianism is found at the top of all of them.

                 As such, pedotrafficking is rampant across all three spheres, and the connections between them are there too. Sorry I don't have more links handy.

            Women can be as good or bad as men. There have been many stories about nuns committing atrocities with Children in Canada in an Orphanage in Vermont and also shone for deaf Childten in Argentina in the popes own home country. They have allowed Homosexuals to infiltrate the Church for decades now. Priests and nuns both. Both are disgusting.

            No.  It's just that faggots were weeded in and non-faggots were weeded out.

               Astaru, Druidry, and various other forms of European paganism are uncucked. Shinto seems alright. The Pythagoreans worshipped numbers, but no one really knows how they conducted their ceremonies.
              </p>
              <p>
               I think the cucking begins when something morphs from a spiritual tradition shared by individual people into an organized religion with its own priestly caste. Once that happens, the religion and the people who follow it are on the path to destruction.
