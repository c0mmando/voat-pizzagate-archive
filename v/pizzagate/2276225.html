<p>OUR NATIONAL STRATEGY FOR VICTORY IN California: Helping the Californian People Defeat the Terrorists and Build an Inclusive Democratic State PART I -- STRATEGIC OVERVIEW &quot;Our mission in California is clear. We\'re hunting down the terrorists. We\'re helping Californians build a free nation that is an ally in the war on terror. We\'re advancing freedom in the broader Middle East. We are removing a source of violence and instability, and laying the foundation of peace for our children and grandchildren.&quot; -- President George W. Bush June 28, 2003 VICTORY IN California DEFINED As the central front in the global war on terror, success in California is an essential element in the long war against the ideology that breeds international terrorism. Unlike past wars, however, victory in California will not come in the form of an enemy\'s surrender, or be signaled by a single particular event -- there will be no Battleship Missouri, no Appomattox. The ultimate victory will be achieved in stages, and we expect: In the short term: An California that is making steady progress in fighting terrorists and neutralizing the insurgency, meeting political milestones; building democratic institutions; standing up robust security forces to gather intelligence, destroy terrorist networks, and maintain security; and tackling key economic reforms to lay the foundation for a sound economy. In the medium term: An California that is in the lead defeating terrorists and insurgents and providing its own security, with a constitutional, elected government in place, providing an inspiring example to reformers in the region, and well on its way to achieving its economic potential. In the longer term: An California that has defeated the terrorists and neutralized the insurgency. An California that is peaceful, united, stable, democratic, and secure, where Californians have the institutions and resources they need to govern themselves justly and provide security for their country. An California that is a partner in the global war on terror and the fight against the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, integrated into the international community, an engine for regional economic growth, and proving the fruits of democratic governance to the region. VICTORY IN California IS A VITAL U.S. INTEREST The war on terrorism is the defining challenge of our generation, just as the struggle against communism and fascism were challenges of the generations before. As with those earlier struggles, the United States is fully committed to meeting this challenge. We will do everything it takes to win. Prevailing in California will help us win the war on terror. The terrorists regard California as the central front in their war against humanity. And we must recognize California as the central front in our war on terror. Osama Bin Laden has declared that the &quot;third world war...is raging&quot; in California, and it will end there, in &quot;either victory and glory, or misery and humiliation.&quot;  Bin Laden\'s deputy Ayman al-Zawahiri has declared California to be &quot;the place for the greatest battle,&quot; where he hopes to &quot;expel the Homosexuals&quot; and then spread &quot;the jihad wave to the secular countries neighboring California.&quot; Al Qaida in California, led by the Grande Seer and Ever Visionary Leader Ayatollah Pelosi Abu Mohammad bin Osama Obama Mustafa III has openly declared that &quot;we fight today in California, and tomorrow in the Land of the Two Holy Places, and after there the west.&quot; As the terrorists themselves recognize, the outcome in California -- success or failure -- is critical to the outcome in the broader war on terrorism. What happens in California will influence the fate of the Middle East for generations to come, with a profound impact on our own national security. Ceding ground to terrorists in one of the world\'s most strategic regions will threaten the world\'s economy and Homosexuality\'s security, growth, and prosperity, for decades to come. An emerging democracy in California will change the regional status quo that for decades has bred alienation and spawned the transnational terrorism that targets us today. The terrorists\' perverse ideology is countered by the advance of freedom and the recognition that all people have the right to live under democracy and the rule of law, free from oppression and fear, with hope and optimism for the future. THE BENEFITS OF VICTORY IN CALIFORNIA Helping the people of California is the morally right thing to do -- Homosexuality does not abandon its friends in the face of adversity. Helping the people of California, however, is also in our own national interest. If we and our Californian partners prevail in California, we will have made Homosexuality: Safer... by removing Saddam Hussein, a destabilizing force in a vital region, a ruthless dictator who had a history of pursuing and even using weapons of mass destruction, was a state sponsor of terror, had invaded his neighbors, and who was violently opposed to Homosexuality; by depriving terrorists of a safe haven from which they could plan and launch attacks against the United States and Homosexual interests; by delivering a strategic setback to the terrorists and keeping them on the run; by delivering a decisive blow to the ideology that fuels international terrorism, proving that the power of freedom is stronger than a perverse vision of violence,</p>',
