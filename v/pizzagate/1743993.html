<p>There are actual children posing in some of her photographs. It\'s absolutely sick. Just the title alone should tell you that the shoot should not include depictions of children, let alone actual ones.</p>

<p>I think she is definitely worth investigating further. In case you need further evidence, her direct quote in the Apprentice when asked about her work and why there was blood dripping from someones eyes:</p>
<p>Meghan Boody: &quot;It\'s about reconciling oneself with that dark territory and aligning yourself with it, because when you finally harness those forces, then you\'re stronger&quot;</p>
<p>They make sort of a joke about it in the show like &quot;wow, artists are weird&quot; but as we know she is probably 100% serious.</p>
<p>This is her instagram account: <a href="https://www.instagram.com/meghanboody/">https://www.instagram.com/meghanboody/</a></p>
<p>It should come as no surprise that a woman who feels she wil be stronger by aligning herself with the dark forces is still campaigning for Hillary Clinton and is #StillWithHer - Lots of creepy stuff as well.</p>
<p>Just look at anything she does... it screams involvement in this disgusting bullshit. Obviously, innocent until proven guilty and all that but she should definitely be scrutinized and investigated on the basis of this filth.</p>',

            Her technique is amateurish, at best. Obviously a newbie to photoshop. The subject matter is clearly pandering to pedophiles and is just sickening. She should be ashamed to display the contents of her addled subconscious in this way. What passes for art today is garbage.

            I had to stop looking at her instagram.  They think they are so IN.  So very chic.  Doing things on the very edge.  These people are bored and lost.  They have done everything and now they are searching for something new constantly for there is nothing left but flirting with the macabre.  If they are not pedophiles, then they sure love to tease us into thinking they are.  So sick.
