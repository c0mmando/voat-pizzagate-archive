<p>I am getting so fed up with PG lately. I watched everything unfold since the Podesta emails; I\'m with you guys and I believe that there is something here, I don\'t know SPECIFICALLY if it\'s just sexual in nature, blackmail ammo in nature, or life extension/consuming blood/flesh in nature, I HAVE NO IDEA, but I\'m with you, alright?</p>
<p>But for over a year now, I haven\'t seen SHIT happen and if I had a dollar for every empty promise I\'ve seen posted here, I\'d be rich! First it was Kim.Com promising bombshells that wound end HRC\'s campaign, that never happened, and then it was other promises that HRC would be ruined and in jail, nothing, followed by literally hundreds of claims THIS IS IT THIS IS THE BIG ONE BOMBSHELL and know what happens every god damn time?</p>
<p>NOTHING.</p>
<p>Sure, we have sealed indictments, but who knows when they\'ll be opened. I thought of something worse. First off, I don\'t necessarily think Trump is on our side. I know a lot of you do, fine, put all your faith in him, but let\'s have a skeptical discussion here. Know what\'s better than outing tons of pedos/sickos/cannibals? Having EVIDENCE against them, then controlling everything about their lives with the threat of releasing the information to the right people.</p>
<p>Think about it. If Trump really had all this damaging info, what makes more sense?</p>
<p>Release it publicly, which would cause an undeniable shitstorm of deniers, political and social inability, possibly civil war, possible actual war, who knows</p>
<p>VS</p>
<p>Keep it close to the chest, and use that info to control ALL of your enemies.</p>
<p>Idk man. I\'m just getting so disheartened nothing has happened from this, I don\'t think PG is fake, I don\'t think it\'s a russian distraction, but NOTHING IS HAPPENING. And before you tell me to be patient, it\'s been like a YEAR AND A HALF. If he has evidence of this happening and doing nothing, he should be held accountable for the lives of the children that have been taken since it\'s discovery.</p>
