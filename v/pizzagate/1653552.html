            Well, the mods removed this, so I'm going to call it a night. I don't know if this organization is related to pizzagate, all I know is Wilson is a busy woman and she believes some dumb stuff. Might be worth digging some more, but I'm going to call it a night. See my editted comment below for all the information I managed to gather.

            Great research here. GUIDE is extremely suspicious, anything linked to Kreher is beyond suspicious. Keep digging and archiving, David and ConcernedParent. It's all coming together and forming an extremely clear but disgusting picture.

            ; sorry, but you have not provided enough evidence this is Pizzagate related. If there is evidence, other than standard clip art that might or might not be pedo signaling (such as pro pedo commentary from employees you can link to, association with known pedos or something) please repost with an explanation and links to the evidence. You haven't even explained what lead you to suspect this guy and this woman. Removing per Rule 1.

            Mods would be quite grateful if you would take it upon yourself to archive removed submissions each week in whatever manner YOU deem most transparent and robust, and make a post linking to them in
            <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/v/pizzagatemods">
             v/pizzagatemods
            </a>
            . You could make a single post and update it with a fresh link to newly archived material, or make a whole new post each week, whichever you think best.
           </p>
           <p>
            I can assure you that we will be quite happy to have a handy backup of removed files, as it will allow us to much more easily track which users habitually ignore the rules or spam the board with the same non-compliant posts repeatedly. Thanks in advance from the whole team! :-)

            About GUIDE:
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             A non-profit community-based substance abuse prevention agency that has been serving Georgia since 1986. GUIDE’s mission is to mobilize and equip the community with the information and strategies needed to promote positive youth development, improve community conditions and address other issues associated with substance use and abuse.
            </p>
           </blockquote>
           <p>
            They have been around for a while. Doesn't seem like they're very good at their job though, Georgia still has a substance abuse problem. Wtf are they doing?
           </p>
           <p>
            Then again, maybe it makes sense. Wilson's LinkedIn account says she's a "True Colors Certified Facilitator" in addition to being CEO of GUIDE. What is a True Colors Facilitator, you ask?
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             True Colors® is a model for understanding yourself and others based on your personality temperament. The colors of Orange, Gold, Green and Blue are used to differentiate the four central personality styles of True Colors®.
            </p>
            <p>
             Each of us has a combination of these True Colors that make up our personality spectrum, usually with one of the styles being the most dominant.
            </p>
           </blockquote>
           <p>
            If it sounds like bullshit, it's because it is:
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             after one of the speakers finished showing us a film about the benefits of emotional intelligence, a facilitator stood at the front of the room and told us they were certified in the True Colors program, and proceeded to show us some powerpoint slides. (obviously being certified makes the program authentic, right?) I was unimpressed, and the more I heard, the more uncomfortable I became. The head manager approached and asked if I was alright, probably because of the sour look on my face. I replied I was not, that I thought what was being presented was nothing more than horoscopes reduced to colors, and that attempting to place each of the very unique individuals in the room (about 40 of us) into four colored boxes was ridiculous. I was assured that it was just an exercise in teamwork, and that it wasn't meant to divide the group.
            </p>
            <p>
             Yet right after that we were split into our color groups and asked to complete the same task. We were then split into random non-color groups and asked to complete another task. The discussion afterwards seemed to indicated that it's more difficult for some colors to play nice if they're stuck together in the same group.
            </p>
            <p>
             I guess what bothered me the most was that the whole thing was presented, not as though it were for entertainment purposes, but as though it was some sort of scientific finding that we should embrace.
            </p>
            <p>
             I mean c'mon, the 'certified' facilitator even showed us a slide showing how the True Colors program was something that could trace its roots back to Plato and Socrates.
            </p>
            <p>
             Oh, I forgot to mention that the certified facilitator said that each of us was born with our present personality and that it doesn't change over the course of our life. Of course after the meeting most of my co-workers were positive the color they were assigned was correct, and some even mentioned how it explained the behavior of their orange or gold child/children. One co-worker thought the test was useful in pointing out how people have different personalities, but she didn't like how people were comparing colors afterwards. Not surprisingly I was confirmed as a green. Not sure how they got Mother Teresa to take their test, but one of the slides had her as a blue.

How and where we drew the pig was then revealed to demonstrate various things about our personalities (for example, if you drew small ears, then you need to listen more). The funny thing was that where and how I drew my pig resulted in a personality profile that was entirely unlike me. If I'd drawn the opposite of what I had, then it would have been a reasonable match, albeit still very general.

            So, Ms. Wilson not only believes this heaping pile of trash, but she is also a "facilitator", someone who gets people to take these tests and believe these things. And this lady is also the CEO of a substance abuse organisation for kids?

            It also has a swirl logo, though to be fair it doesn't look like some of the swirl logos we see elsewhere. But it is worth mentioning and pointing out for informational purposes.

            So this woman helps run yet another children organization? Well, that doesn't automatically make her involved in pizzagate, maybe she just really cares about kids.  I still question how competent someone can be when they believe and preach shit like "True Colors".

             Currently, there are approximately 10,000 youth in the foster care system within the state of Georgia. As these youth experience the day to day life as a foster child, they may endure multiple living placements, educational instability, a loss of connectedness - and as they become teens, a feeling of hopelessness and uncertainty.

            <p>
             Teens R 4 Me is an initiative within DFCS to strengthen and improve continuous engagement and support to youth, ages 14-21, in foster care that will ensure quality case management visits and support that lead to their successful transition into young adulthood. Within the Teens R 4 Me strategic framework, there are five pillars. Through quality Every Child Every Month (ECEM) visits and current statewide Independent Living Program services, our goal is to ensure our youth transition into young adulthood: 1. Safe, 2. Healthy, 3. Educated, 4. Employable and 5. Connected.

            Apparently this company provides software for tracking participants at conferences? I barely looked at this to be honest, I'm getting ready for bed, so someone else should dig here. All I can say is, Wilson is one busy woman.

            I'm checking it out. It's definitely weird. Andrews-Wilson sure seems like a bit of a hack. She believes some really stupid things. I'll post a more informative post when I'm done digging a bit.

            It's a private instagram account, but we get her name, Jessica Andrews-Wilson. From there, Google takes us to GUIDE where she is executive director:

            Check out that pentagram and spiral in the logo. I'm not an experienced researcher. I don't really know where to go next with this lead.

             Well, that picture is really odd.  Why would you want to post a pic like that for your header picture?  Start by typing her name in and adding sex abuse, pornography, hillary clinton, orphanage, trafficking, etc. You get the idea.  Arrests is another good one.  Haiti, etc. There are many more.
