            With children involved this absolutely explains the reason why so many Hollywood and political figures stuck their neck out for him. I was curious about it and my gut said there surely must be more going on.

            Ari Emanuel is Michael Moore's agent. With the MAGA hats the two Nigerian men bought, this seems like more than ever a democratic operation to throw shade on Trump. (MAGA hats are to show support for him......ie Trump supporters just hate a  black gay man). Am sure some here won't understand as they feel the same way........i.e. broader context.

             They were not maga hats. They were just red hats. Nigerian guys were just getting the best deal and keeping the extra money. Whole operation was the most amateur couple of hours ever staged in politics. The noose was a string. The letter sent through the Postal system?   Puleeze!

            I can't watch right now.  Can you give a thumbnail on the connection?  Given that the Mullet is in photos with Hussein and his husband and also friends with other Swamp dwellers, it wouldn't surprise me at all to find out he's a kid toucher too.

            Smullett has that same "aw c'mon man..." persona like John Legend.  Or Jane Legend and her husband Chris Tiegan (sp).  And we have a pretty good idea of what their (pedo) deal is.

             When the files on the Smullett case were 'inadvertently' released Kim Foxx said it was a mistake that his files should not have been sealed. Then CPD said 'oops, they released the files by mistake.  In the midst of this, the name of FBI Special Agent Greg Wing came up. He is in charge of the Violent Sex Crimes and Violent Crimes against Children Division in the Chicago field office of the FBI.  Lionel is saying that some people are speculating that Wing was connected with the Smollett case because he is involved in some kind of FBI sex trafficing investigation.  Lionel says he doesn't know himself but I think that as he's a lawyer he has to be careful how he puts news forward of course.  I think this is interesting because Lionel would not make a video like this unless he knew there is something significant here.

             He brings up the name Ari Emanuel and says , what if Jussie Smullett was somehow involved in revealing something very nefarious that Emanuel is involved with?  And that Emanuel wanted to destroy Smullett's reputation. Of course, Ari's brother is the mayor of Chicago.  Lionel also mention's JS's laywer Tina Glandian who works for Geragos (see:
             <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/v/pizzagate/3120380">
              Creepy porn lawyer Avenatti arrested. Co-conspirator is attorney Mark Geragos who represents Jussie Smollett, Colin Kaepernick and Clare Bronfman of NXIVM!
             </a>
            </p>
            <p>
             Then he also mentions Lori Lightfood (who is in charge of the Chicago Police Board and who he thinks will be the next mayor of Chicago) and Toni Preckwinkle (President of Cook County and mentor to Kim Foxx).. it's complicated and messy.

              Rahm Emanuel's father blew up buses in Israel..Rahm has duel citizenship. Read a Vanity Fair article about him years ago..when he was first appointed chief of staff for obomba. The Vanity Fair article stated he had a little device on his desk that could trace every step obomba made. Handler? Anyway, at the time we were bombing the daylights out of the middle east, a foreign operative was watching our president.

               Wayne Madsen said on his website that rahm and obomba visited chicago bath houses for gay men together. Am sure this was known in DC but a secret for the rest of US.
