<p><a href="http://imgur.com/a/oy3Ol">http://imgur.com/a/oy3Ol</a></p>
<p>Just scroll to November 2012 to find it:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.facebook.com/TrolleyPark/posts/#">https://www.facebook.com/TrolleyPark/posts/#</a></p>
<p>It looks like Jeff was the President of the North Columbia Heights Civic Association (now ran by Yavonne &amp; David Boyd, who are thanked in more recent posts on the page for helping put on events).</p>
<p>After googling his name, one of the first results was this document titled <strong>&quot;Sexual Exploitation Crimes Against Children,&quot;</strong> and the section written by Zeeman called <strong>&quot;Meeting the Government\'s Discovery Obligations in Child Exploitation.&quot;</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://www.justice.gov/sites/default/files/usao/legacy/2011/09/08/usab5905.pdf">https://www.justice.gov/sites/default/files/usao/legacy/2011/09/08/usab5905.pdf</a></p>
<p>The second link to catch my eye was a picture of a Jeffrey Zeeman from an Obama fundraiser in 2007:</p>
<p><a href="http://shfwire.com/files/images/IMG_0462.thumbnail.JPG">http://shfwire.com/files/images/IMG_0462.thumbnail.JPG</a></p>
<p>&quot;Jeffrey Zeeman, 31, a lawyer at Covington &amp; Burling LLP, said he heard about it from someone at his law firm.&quot;</p>
<p><a href="http://www.shfwire.com/obama-mixer-brings-party-and-politics-together/">http://www.shfwire.com/obama-mixer-brings-party-and-politics-together/</a></p>
<p>Looking on Facebook again we can see that this is the same Jeff Zeeman from the photo:</p>
<p><a href="https://archive.is/12iOD">https://archive.is/12iOD</a></p>
<p>One of his most recent pics is in the Hillary &quot;H&quot; logo.</p>
<p>Here is the archived page of his likes, you can see that the NCHCA is listed, along with his colleges:</p>
<p><a href="https://archive.is/reql0">https://archive.is/reql0</a></p>
<p>So Jeff Zeeman the attorney and Jeff Zeeman the NCHCA President from the Trolley Park Facebook page are most likely one in the same.</p>
<p>His LinkedIn page confirms that he is the same guy from the Obama event (Covington &amp; Burling):</p>
<p><a href="https://archive.is/4HjvD">https://archive.is/4HjvD</a></p>
<p>It also lists him currently as Acting Assistant Deputy Chief for Policy and Legislation for the <strong>US Department of Justice -- Child Exploitation and Obscenity Section</strong>.</p>
<p>So the same guy who is mentioned by this small park in DC is heavily involved in pedophilia and child pornography cases in the government, both in prosecuting and in now in national policymaking.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Bonus: There\'s a property</strong></p>
<p>We know his middle name is Howard as he\'s listed here:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.plainsite.org/dockets/2h152v76o/indiana-southern-district-court/usa-v-edwards-et-al/">https://www.plainsite.org/dockets/2h152v76o/indiana-southern-district-court/usa-v-edwards-et-al/</a></p>
<p>and in an article about his wedding:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2005/09/25/fashion/weddings/anne-pluta-and-jeffrey-zeeman.html?_r=0">http://www.nytimes.com/2005/09/25/fashion/weddings/anne-pluta-and-jeffrey-zeeman.html?_r=0</a></p>
<p>A Jeffrey H. Zeeman is the owner of a property very close to &quot;Trolley Turnaround Park&quot; and Pegasus Museum listed here as 1103-1105 #8 Park Rd NW:</p>
<p><a href="http://dcra.dc.gov/sites/default/files/dc/sites/dcra/publication/attachments/Building_Permit_Issued_April2011complete.pdf">http://dcra.dc.gov/sites/default/files/dc/sites/dcra/publication/attachments/Building_Permit_Issued_April2011complete.pdf</a></p>
<p>A permit was issued for this property for &quot;new rooftop deck specifically for #8 with spiral stair&quot; in 2011.</p>
<p>Here is a screenshot of the relevant info:</p>

<p>And here is an image of the 2 minute walking distance to Pegasus Museum, just past the park:</p>
<p><a href="http://imgur.com/a/Oqwxr">http://imgur.com/a/Oqwxr</a></p>
<p>What do we think guys? Is there something here? I just wanted to get more eyes on this guy and see if anyone else can dig up anything!</p>',

            So he's on the inside... this is typical (not saying he is guilty) of those that have trial lawyers and judges in their pockets to help get the child molesters more lenient sentences.... literally a 1000 cases like this in the CP world:

            ask yourself this.... it just SO happens that this guy practices law in Child Porn cases?!?! It just SO happens that this guy lives next door to Richard DuBeshter and it just SO happens that the BIGGEST potential pedophilia ring ever uncovered in the history of the United States owns a building less than a nerf ball throw away from his house???????

            Yes this is the same Jeff Zeeman .... good gawd... you understand we already identified him in my thread on the Pedo Coded message
           </p>

           </p>
           <p>
            But we weren't sure if he was the "Z" referred to here or not. Jeff Zeeman is a FaceBook friend of Richard DuBeshter and it's the same mother fucker b/c I've seen the pictures. Scroll down and find Jeff Zeeman on his friends list here:

            And according to your address information, he lives next door to Richard DuBeshter who owns 1102 and 1104 Monroe St NW... read my updated VOAT in the Summary section to verify all of this:

             Could these guys only being doing their jobs? Was the coded message from Richard sent to Z a hint that "a possible pedophile is lurking around the playground?"
            </p>
            <p>
             This is so confusing, I don't know anymore.
            </p>
            <p>
             But these 'elite pedo ring members' are smart AF and their spider webs are so tightly-knit, that it makes it extremely difficult to prove that they're on the wrong side of the fence.

              I agree,,, You have to think of all possibilities including this is all a Psyop. But if PG IS a Psyop, it started a long time ago as we have seen the Pizza/Ped theme has been going on for a while. My hunch is that the Podesta emails are Ped coded and they are freaking out. There's a lot of players out there - Including in this Voat Group. Some are White hats and some Black hats. I am observing in the background. Always questioning motives.

              Not sure yet, Jeff Zeeman could be a dead link and may be not related to this at all ... but the fact that RD sent a coded message on a public page makes it all the more strange. If he was going to warn about a pedophile in the area, he'd just message them personally... no reason for codes on a public forum that anyone (including the pedophile) could see.

            I DL a PDF from some Dc property, and its many pages. When I search Clinton on the PDF, a listing comes up; but pic won't enlarge enough for me to read.
           </p>
           <p>
            I also put Clinton in a Dc property search , District Of Columbia Real Property and something comes up for Clinton.
           </p>
           <p>
            Then a search on green card and other immigrant to work in USA, brings up a lot of Clinton foundation and related programs. Am wondering if any names found on this subverse, come up on green card/ other types of immigrant filings for jobs.

              Hi, thankyou, appreciate.
             </p>
             <p>
              Dcra.Dc.gov 2015 building permits PDF file 57 pages. When I enter Clinton in a search on that PDF file, comes up once. 3.57 mbm is size of PDF. Good resource to put in other names, esp owners and attorneys they use.
             </p>
             <p>
              Also, I need to refund the govt website that shows Clinton and others are filing to use immigrants and refugees for jobs at cf and affiliated programs of cf. Comes under green card and another term, like H- something.
             </p>
             <p>
              Also, Obamacare used two types, hr-5 and another for allowing corps on Obamacare to hire immigrants, esp with Logisticare owned by providence that owns igneus corp. For drivers and call staff for fed nemt, non emergency medical transport. A lot of fraud going on in nemt, that fraud bills and blocks safe or timely access to medical for recipients of all ages.

            I am starting to believe that they put as many people into the Child Welfare Agencies and Trafficking Units...just to have a heads up on what the real cops and real honest people are doing.  So they can let the little non Illuminati scum get caught but warn and stop investigations against any connected friends.   Really stomach turning to realize that most likely every agency that has anything to do with Child Trafficking is likely filled will corruption.

             Looking into people in power in these agencies can't be a bad place to start. I just keep opening tabs on people connected to him, seeing if anything else catches my eye.

             Yeah, I'm not a fan of his obsession with anti-marijuana legislation, but if he prosecutes these disgusting freaks then he'll forever be a hero in my eyes.

            But regarding Zeeman as 'Z' - so when the peculiar message is sent in August of 2016, he supposedly has moved (2012).  I agree this is the most natural nickname and abbreviation of his name, but the dates don't seem to match up.

              Yes. He's one of the Z's you found on Richard D's FB friends' list :D 
Looks like they're neighbours and work together and are... 'tight'.Well, not tight like that but, hell yeah, maybe? Ha. Could very well be the Z we're looking for.

            <em>
             Jeffrey Zeeman has been a Trial Attorney for the Child Exploitation and Obscenity Section (CEOS) in
the Criminal Division of the U.S. Department of Justice since 2008. Prior to joining the Department, Mr.
Zeeman was a litigation associate at the Washington, D.C. office of Covington &amp; Burling LLP and the
Boston office of Bingham McCutchen LLP and an Assistant District Attorney in Middlesex County,
Massachusetts.
            </em>
           </p>
           <p>
            Its hard to tell if he still works at the Covington &amp; Burling LLP...or they both might have come from there.
           </p>
           <p>
            We just have to be sure...because we will run into the same problems like we had with 4 Andrew Kline's and 1 worked in the DOJ.

            This is the only spiral staircase picture I could find posted by JAlefantis. They don't seem to be friends on FB either. I don't know if there is a connection between the two. What's obvious is that his place is near Pegasus and Trolley Park and that he's friends with Richard DuBeshter on FB.

              This is really important man... I don't know if you know the implications here.... these sick fuks have people working on the inside from lawyers, judges, attorneys, DC Commissioners, US Consulate (for granting Visas to transporting children from China to the US?), to GQ top 50 powerful people like JA who happens to be friends and dated David Brock as well as John Podesta.... this Judith person if my hunch is right is placing children into the houses of Richard DuBeshter homes who probably has his Euro Pedo friends move in to as well as US satanists who probably pay for the homes but don't live there... etc ... just thinking out loud here.

            Guys, great work, just wanted to say that you should keep in mind some of the images captured with Google Maps may be fairly old. So if you wanted a more up-to-date view of the street signs and/or graffiti marks
            <em>
             (I don't think the yearly Google copyright watermark is accurate)
            </em>
            , then you'd need someone locally who'd be willing to do some fieldwork and take photographs. Sadly I'm halfway around the world but I just wanted to throw it out there.
           </p>
           <p>
            Cheers, keep up the solid work. This is my first post on the site, been following you guys closely.

              It actually sounds like this could be plausible.... I've identified aasaq to be summer in my other thread here:
             </p>
             <p>
              <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/v/pizzagate/1550573#submissionTop">
               https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1550573#submissionTop
              </a>
             </p>
             <p>
              It's the only word that is actually spelled out in a different language in the entire coded message, so I know that that word has a lot of significance obviously.... and I think Summer (which is a very recent popular child's name) is a little girl or potentially their CP "Summer" file since he posted the coded message in the middle of August, a summer month.

             Btw, decoded with simple geomatria and the post means this: "God moon, send china angel, now." Or he could be referring to (Z) Zeeman, I guess. Possibly placing an order for a chinese girl or chinese CP file? Anyway, it's something to consider since Wylita Bell's work is related to China. There could be traffic or CP going on.

              Can you show your work please? I'm trying to understand. So what do you do? Convert it to simple geomatria and then convert that to English geomatria? How do you arrive at this?

               Type in the word or code. Go down to the simple gematria version and number related to it. First word at the top of that list is most probably the answer. I guess the best (top answer) would be with the one with the largest number of searches found for it? For example aasaq here:
               <a href="http://www.gematrix.org/?word=aasaq">
                http://www.gematrix.org/?word=aasaq
               </a>
               scroll all the way down to the simple gematria and pick the first word at the top (the most popular). That's it. Repeat for every coded word posted.

              Well done. Im interested if your familiar with geometry in relation to these sick elites. Do you think it is a strange coincedence that pizzagate equals 666 in english geomatria?

               It's an arabic name. Strange.

              <p>
               This person exists. Anuar with a 'U' though is not Anuar with a 'W'. So it could be unrelated or someone completely random. I bet there are thousands of Anwar Elhanafi though. I don't know what this is supposed to mean.

               I know nothing about geomatria, i just followed a link after someone had suggested it could be simple geometria coding and i followed the rules. Indeed strange that PG would equal 666. Thanks for taking the time to point it out.

                No if there was a C missing there would be anomalies that make that evident. Everything is perfect and uniform with no sign anything is missing or added. There is even a box around the letters that is perfect and uniform. Nothing missing here. Now I think maybe there is a c missing because of human mistake not camera messing up.

                 Ah true a cam error seems inconsistent with the rest of the sign.

                 I think the NCHCA is likely supposed to be involved with every park in the neighborhood? I wonder how many there are though.
