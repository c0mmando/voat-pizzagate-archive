<p>Hello Fellow Pizzagaters! Read Q\'s post this morning. For this that missed it, it\'s this one: </p>

<p>I was particularly intrigued by the EYES WIDE OPEN part and decided to go dumpster diving to get a handle on what the film was about. I found more than I expected. In fact, I was of shocked by some of this. Maybe it\'s just all the people involved in this elite circle are crazy. Straight up crazy. Who knows? The info I dug up more concerns what was put in place to create the mess we have today. In other words, WTH got us here? Short answer: Plenty. The line from The Rolling Stones song SYMPATHY FOR THE DEVIL keeps running through my head. The lyric, ‚ÄúCan you guess my name?‚Äù and the title of the song will become more relevant before we reach the bottom of this murky pit.  
</p>
<p>Right out of the gate, I knew something was up. I immediately found a 2013 article that contained all the buzzwords that we pizzagaters commonly use today even though it was written five years ago. The blog post concerned how Kubrick chose filming locations. The scene featuring Tom Cruise in Greenwich Village was broken down in excruciating detail. I guess Kubrick really was trying to tell us something. </p>

<p>According to the Wikipedia article, ‚ÄúKubrick‚Äôs perfectionism went as far as sending workmen to Manhattan to measure street widths and note newspaper vending machine locations‚Ä¶overseeing every visual element that would appear in a given frame, from props and furniture to the color of walls and other objects.‚Äù</p>
<p>And yet, as I was watching, I began to notice some spatial issues of my own. Could Eyes Wide Shut be part of the conspiracy too?? Let‚Äôs take a trip to Kubrick‚Äôs Greenwich Village‚Ä¶</p>
<h1>Wallowing over his wife‚Äôs adulterous fantasies, Bill Harford wanders through the Village. As we go, I‚Äôm going to point out a few buildings to remember. First, note the green-awninged Pizza Parlor and the yellow Mexican Restaurant beside it:</h1>
<p>He arrives at the next corner ‚Äì and wait a minute‚Ä¶There‚Äôs the pizza restaurant again!</p>
<p>but where did the Mexican restaurant go? The plot thickens‚Ä¶</p>
<p>Bill meet Domino the hooker, and they cross the street. Over their shoulder, we see the Vacant Lot again ‚Äì which means the corner Deli has now become a white-signed Hardware Store. Harder to see but just two doors down from the Vacant Lot is the Stairway Storefront.</p>

<p>PIZZA? MEXICAN RESTAURANT NEXT TO IT THAT DISAPPEARS? Then he meets DOMINO the hooker? This domino? </p>

<p>I really do suggest you read the entire piece. To sum it up, buildings keep appearing and then changing into other ownerships or busnesses. To me, it\'s saying that there\'s the facade of what the business is as spelled out in the sign, but then there\'s what it really is. The blogger concludes by drawing a map of the street as defined by Kubrick. </p>

<p>I really do wonder if the map matches an actual locale where there is a \'\'pizza\'\' restaurant surrounded by all the component parts you need for sex trafficking. And the laughable thing is this: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>PS ‚Äì There‚Äôs one shot in Eyes Wide Shut that I was sure was filmed in New York ‚Äì when Bill walks by the Village‚Äôs very real Pink Pussy Cat Boutique. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Pink Pussy Cats? Isn\'t that what the left had women wearing to proclaim Women\'s Rights? Pink Pussy Cat Hats? Just a coincidence ... </p>
<p>I decided to put this ‚Äò‚Äôdisappearing‚Äô‚Äô, ‚Äò‚Äôbehind-the-scenes restaurant‚Äô‚Äô to the test in terms of what that would mean today. In other words, while the film was produced in 1999, would Mexico being the supplier of ‚Äò‚Äôpizza‚Äô‚Äô still be relevant? I remembered Q‚Äôs post about Allison Mack and her heroic attempt to stop a speeding police car and thought ‚Ä¶ hmmmm ‚Ä¶. the dump Keith Raniere was in Mexico. Here‚Äôs Q‚Äôs post: </p>

<p>You see? The future will prove the past. If EYES WIDE SHUT is relevant, it should be able to be proven relevant. So I found out where the dump was arrested: </p>

<h1>GOOD TIME CLEOPATRA? Really?</h1>
<p>So now we have The Cannibal Queen, Pocahontas, and now CLEO!!!! </p>
<p>But let‚Äôs return to the map and see how easily one could slip girls in and out of the country from that location with no one being the wiser. Is there anything else about Mexico? Something that would put it on the map as being uber important and relevant? There sure is. Seems The Process Church planted a seed there. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>In March of 1966, The Process moved into a mansion on Balfour Place in the Mayfair district of London ‚Ä¶ Garbed in matching black uniforms‚Äîconsisting of tailor-made magician‚Äôs capes with the Mendez goat of Satan stitched in red on the back‚ÄîThe Process sponsored public gatherings during this period. For a half-pound admittance fee, the faithful were treated to telepathy circles, midnight meditations, ‚ÄúI Ching‚Äù interpretations, group encounter games (for instance, one called ‚ÄúRape‚Äù), and guidance in the Tarot and Kabala. Many of these activities took place in a coffee bar called Satan‚Äôs Cavern, located in the basement of Balfour Place.</p>
<p>Later in 1966, the group moved their headquarters to Xtul, on the Yucatan peninsula of Mexico, and there things took a decidedly spiritual turn, the resulting cosmology of which consisted of four co-equal entities: Christ, Jehovah, Lucifer and Satan; each representing a different spiritual path that a Process member could adopt.  
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But would The Process Church figure into sex trafficking, CP, and the like? You would think that any group with game called ‚Äò‚ÄôRAPE‚Äô‚Äô would, but let‚Äôs see: </p>
<p>&lt; <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#">https://groups.google.com/forum/#</a>!topic/alt.conspiracy/3ZX3y9ky-H8</p>
<blockquote>
<p>After snorting a large amount of cocaine provided by Crispo, Vesti donned the hood and was handcuffed.  LeGeros, as instructed by Crispo, then shot Vesti twice--once to kill Vesti\'s body and once to kill his soul.  Vesti was also stabbed and his blood was drunk, and then Crispo sexually molested the corpse.  The heart was also cut out, and the body set on fire.</p>
<p>LeGeros wasn\'t homosexual, but he worked for Crispo in order to sustain his cocaine habit.  Crispo supplied the cocaine.  According to numerous sources, Crispo lured gay men into a back room of his art gallery, where they were tied up and whipped by LeGeros, who sometimes dressed as a police officer.  Crispo, according to a friend of LeGeros named Billy Meyer, also had a Hitler fantasy and reveled in the notion of Nazi uniforms.  Crispo had also been a guest at parties thrown by Roy Radin before his disappearance and death.</p>
<p>After being convicted of Vesti\'s murder, LeGeros said that Crispo was in a Satanic cult composed of wealthy people CRispo knew, including Roy Radin.  The cult had snuff films and also drank blood in ceremonies. When Vesti was killed, Crispo told LeGeros, &quot;Drink the blood.  We always drink the blood in the cult.&quot;  LeGeros himself was not a member of the cult. ‚Ä¶ </p>
<p>Child pornography, drug trafficking, rape, murder--these are only a few of the fields in which can be found members of a diabolical network that stretches from one end of the country to another.  A network of Satanic cults descended from one cult:  the Process Church of the Final Judgement.  Such is its legacy.</p>
<p>And the cults are still active today.  Charles Manson told a jury in California, &quot;And what about your children? You say there are just a few?  There are many, many more, and they are running in the streets, and they are running in the same direction‚ÄîAND THEY ARE COMING RIGHT AT YOU!&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Well, it would seem that says it all. Baphomet, Nazi uniforms, blood drinking, kiddie porn, an elite rich satanic cabal, drugs ‚Ä¶ and there are other ‚Äò‚ÄôSons‚Äô‚Äô out there. There‚Äôs also a mention of someone central: Roy Radin. But since I‚Äôm running out of real estate, let‚Äôs get back to the scene in Greenwich Village. I wonder wonder wonder what Greenwich Village might connect with? </p>

           But let‚Äôs return to the map and see how easily one could slip girls in and out of the country from that location with no one being the wiser. Is there anything else about Mexico? Something that would put it on the map as being uber important and relevant? There sure is. Seems The Process Church planted a seed there.

            In March of 1966, The Process moved into a mansion on Balfour Place in the Mayfair district of London ‚Ä¶ Garbed in matching black uniforms‚Äîconsisting of tailor-made magician‚Äôs capes with the Mendez goat of Satan stitched in red on the back‚ÄîThe Process sponsored public gatherings during this period. For a half-pound admittance fee, the faithful were treated to telepathy circles, midnight meditations, ‚ÄúI Ching‚Äù interpretations, group encounter games (for instance, one called ‚ÄúRape‚Äù), and guidance in the Tarot and Kabala. Many of these activities took place in a coffee bar called Satan‚Äôs Cavern, located in the basement of Balfour Place.

           <p>
            Later in 1966, the group moved their headquarters to Xtul, on the Yucatan peninsula of Mexico, and there things took a decidedly spiritual turn, the resulting cosmology of which consisted of four co-equal entities: Christ, Jehovah, Lucifer and Satan; each representing a different spiritual path that a Process member could adopt.

           But would The Process Church figure into sex trafficking, CP, and the like? You would think that any group with game called ‚Äò‚ÄôRAPE‚Äô‚Äô would, but let‚Äôs see:

           <p>
            After snorting a large amount of cocaine provided by Crispo, Vesti donned the hood and was handcuffed.  LeGeros, as instructed by Crispo, then shot Vesti twice--once to kill Vesti's body and once to kill his soul.  Vesti was also stabbed and his blood was drunk, and then Crispo sexually molested the corpse.  The heart was also cut out, and the body set on fire.
           </p>
           <p>
            LeGeros wasn't homosexual, but he worked for Crispo in order to sustain his cocaine habit.  Crispo supplied the cocaine.  According to numerous sources, Crispo lured gay men into a back room of his art gallery, where they were tied up and whipped by LeGeros, who sometimes dressed as a police officer.  Crispo, according to a friend of LeGeros named Billy Meyer, also had a Hitler fantasy and reveled in the notion of Nazi uniforms.  Crispo had also been a guest at parties thrown by Roy Radin before his disappearance and death.
           </p>
           <p>
            After being convicted of Vesti's murder, LeGeros said that Crispo was in a Satanic cult composed of wealthy people CRispo knew, including Roy Radin.  The cult had snuff films and also drank blood in ceremonies. When Vesti was killed, Crispo told LeGeros, "Drink the blood.  We always drink the blood in the cult."  LeGeros himself was not a member of the cult. ‚Ä¶

            Child pornography, drug trafficking, rape, murder--these are only a few of the fields in which can be found members of a diabolical network that stretches from one end of the country to another.  A network of Satanic cults descended from one cult:  the Process Church of the Final Judgement.  Such is its legacy.
           </p>
           <p>
            And the cults are still active today.  Charles Manson told a jury in California, "And what about your children? You say there are just a few?  There are many, many more, and they are running in the streets, and they are running in the same direction‚ÄîAND THEY ARE COMING RIGHT AT YOU!"
           </p>

           Well, it would seem that says it all. Baphomet, Nazi uniforms, blood drinking, kiddie porn, an elite rich satanic cabal, drugs ‚Ä¶ and there are other ‚Äò‚ÄôSons‚Äô‚Äô out there. There‚Äôs also a mention of someone central: Roy Radin. But since I‚Äôm running out of real estate, let‚Äôs get back to the scene in Greenwich Village. I wonder wonder wonder what Greenwich Village might connect with?

             Adam Schiff is indeed a part of it. I haven't gotten to him. I collected so much stuff ... and haven't even gotten to the part about cannibals and the tie-in to yet another super rich family. You know, I'm thinking about this tie-in with the rich and Leslie van Houghton. Lots sympathized with her because she was this rich bitch and they figured she wouldn't normally have come up with serial murders on her own, but is that true? Makes me think of things in another light.
            </p>
            <p>
             As for Schiff, he needs a post all his own.

                    I think srayzie is right and this piece of shit is a Muslim. Why else would he be so obsessively hateful towards all women and all Jews. He's pathetic!

                Well, but as we know, Srayzie is not old, but smart and beautiful. It must be terrible, I know, when you're a tranny camel jockey hiding in Mum's basement. :-) My deepest sympathies, Donkey! :-) :-) :-)

                    You show just how low class, inbred, and ignorant you are when you consistently write stupid comments that include sex. You're an absolute joke fucktard! The sad reality is you're so foul and disgusting you can't find a woman even drunk enough at a dive bar willing to have any type of sexual contact with you. I guarantee you are absolutely revolting in person.

                  . I don‚Äôt go with the crowd. That‚Äôs one of the reasons you became so obsessed with me. You ACTUALLY SAID that I wasted my money on medical school. Hmmm I wonder why you would say that. It‚Äôs because I was able to describe your insecurities and why you‚Äôre so fucked in the head better than you could describe yourself. All on the night we first talked. You were intimidated. I told you that I didn‚Äôt pay for medical school. But, thanks for that compliment donkey. You screwed up day 1. Sucks for you.

It‚Äôs no wonder you have issues with women. Once I told you that I knew you had hung out in the tranny sub here, you tried coming up with the lamest excuses. It‚Äôs hysterical seeing you go ballistic when a WOMAN puts you in your place. Since I made your my BITCH, I thought it was only fair that I

I just thought today would be a good time to remind you that you are MY BITCH and you need to know your place. Stop acting like you don‚Äôt remember things about me so you don‚Äôt look obsessed. Other times you tell me I was a slut and had kids in high school. Make a list and stick to script you little CUNT.

                   who is not me, and youre insistence that it IS doesn't make it so.  Rather it proves that women will invariably double-down on whatever makes them feel good, like the "not all ____" bullshit.  You are an impediment to progress.

                   I saw a woman appointed by Obama who looked like Perry Ferrell, laughed, posted it to the "transvestigation" sub, and that's that.  Provide any comment or evidence that I "hung out" there, or just admit you're a woman desperately lying like in every divorce case.

                   that wouldn't be embarrassing since transgenderism is a Jew psyop related to child abuse and thus PG-related.  You lose, again, woman.

                   We let women decide when and who they breed with and we are literally becoming extinct.  By all means keep laughing at it; it will make it that much easier to strip you of the rights that the Jews gave you.  You will be straight property again, because females are nothing but a MEANS to the ENDS that males decide to pursue.

                      allah is the Arabic word for god used by Arabic Christians etc.  Jew media has manipulated you into believing it is only their god, knowing it would never occur to you to fact-check this yourself.

                      he'd probably be glad I was exposing the perverse Jew lie of 'transgenderism', whereas you being a woman would probably have no issue with your son visiting ACTUAL tranny PORN websites.

                    Women don't believe in enforcing standards of behavior; they seek to minimize conflict whenever possible and will let anything slide.  That's why women destroy civilizations when they get rights.  See: history.

                  Just thought I'd point out that your desperation shows.  Your need to feel superior to a woman you know you're inferior to when your whole narrative is that women are inferior to a men.  I've seen her destroy you constantly, and your resulting temper tantrum speaks volumes about the state of your mind.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  But sure, call it whiteknighting even though she seems to need no help causing you to lose your shit.  It's a useful beta shame tactic for when other men disagree with you, and a woman happens to be present.

                   So here's one from just the other day:

                    https://kek.gg/i/5gGkTT.png

                  <p>
                   She is STRIKINGLY dumb, even for a woman -- you would have been better off whiteknighting OP here, who at least has managed to post original research in her 1.5+ years here.  (When she got modded I offered to leave permanently if a single such thread by srayzie could be furnished to me; NO TAKERS LOL.)
                  </p>

                   I am not one to call a tard a tard to its face; but it has practical implications for this sub.  For example:
                   <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/v/pizzagate/2152748">
                    https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/2152748
                   </a>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   The Q (((psyop))) -- whose major "lead" was in fact posted by yours truly (the "joke") half a year prior -- is accomplishing its purpose in no small part due to women.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   It is a proven Jewish subversion tactic to involve women in decision-making, i.e., gaslight "gender equality" into existence, and they depend on white-knight faggots like you to do so.
                  </p>

                      You have trouble making reality-based claims and backing them up.  Something she doesn't seem to have a problem with.  But, of course, noticing that is "defend(ing) her".

            I'm trying to work out what on earth this post is about?  The film is 'Eyes Wide Shut' for starters. Can you give us a break from Q on this subverse please?  Unless you have something very specific- I'm just not into Cluedo.

              Or, how about you fuck off with your anti-Crowley bullshit.
             </p>
             <p>
              Every 2nd or 3rd thread of yours brings up more anti-Satanist propaganda and quite honestly I'm sick to death of it.
             </p>
             <p>
              I have explained the situation regarding Crowley(that Scientology and it's affiliates; NXIVM et al, are the problem) in
              <em>
               RoC-14: Wizards &amp; Warlocks
              </em>
              , even pinged you to it if I'm not mistaken, yet you(and others) continue to try to blame Crowley/OTO/Satanism/Freemasons, etc.
             </p>
             <p>
              You've done some great work with regards to NXIVM, but, you fuck it up every time you try to blame Satanism/Crowley/etc, because that is
              <em>
               EXACTLY what Scientologists and NXIVM(et al)
              </em>
              <strong>
               <em>

               I think we all need to bear in mind that some elements of the institutions we have thought were legit and those we thought were not may all turn out to be related in a different way to the VIPedo Cabal than we expect. The more dispassionately we can observe, question and document it all -- together with our crowd wisdom that brings multiple viewpoints and life experiences to bear -- the more formidable an enemy to Cabal we can be. We're all striving for the same end here. :-)

                I know we are* (bar the shills ofc) and I really try to hold my tongue and let well-meaning people do their thing, but, I've gotta speak up sometimes. It's not just for my own sake - it's for the sake of others, even though most just double-down on the bias/propaganda and hate me for trying to help. I get it, it's hard for many to grasp the things I share, but, it's also hard for me to sit silently while people constantly miss the mark and/or inject Christian/Catholic bias(or just plain ignorance) into it.

                You're absolutely right there and for that reason I do somewhat apologize for the times that I have to passionately object to anti-Satanist(et al) propaganda - I stand up for other parties if required too, though. There's going to be a lot of places for common ground any time Hollywood is brought into it, which is where things get really murky in trying to figure the 'good actors' from the 'bad actors'.
               </p>
               <p>
                With that in mind, though, attempts by Hollywood to spread anti-Satanist propaganda, are pretty damn transparent to at least myself these days - which I guess is part of the problem; my research goes largely unread and so I can't expect people to fully understand why I'm so sure about this stuff, it's a bit of an impass really.
               </p>

               <p>
                * That said, there's still people who don't seem to have the same goal; they want any reason they can find, to blame "Satan"/Satnism/Satnists/Crowley/etc, they don't care about the deeply hidden truths, they care about being right so they can hang(proverbially or literally) a Satanist, because it most likely suits their Christian/Catholic beliefs.

                The show(Smallville) had 2 NXIVM members in the cast; it's absolutely worth looking into the execs behind it.

                What I've been meaning to do, is go through the cast &amp; crew of the TV(Netflix?) series, "The Online Gamer", to look for Scientologists other than Mark Burton and Cathriona white, in order to see if they've shown up on other suspicious sets; Where I'm going with that is,
                <em>
                 "I wonder if any Scientologists(or other NXIVM members) were also involved with Smallville as cast, crew or exec?"
                </em>

                 <p>
                  The April 2 deal marked a turning point for the 100-person multiplatform media firm, which produces three to five tween-skewing YouTube videos a day. DreamWorks Animation purchased Awesomeness, which works with YouTube stars like actress¬†Lia Marie Johnson, in May¬†2013 for as much as $150¬†million, a figure that now seems a steal considering Disney is paying as much as $1 billion for Maker Studios and rival Fullscreen is said to be fielding offers from NBCUniversal and Relativity in the same jaw-dropping range.
