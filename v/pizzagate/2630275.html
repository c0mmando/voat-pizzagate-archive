<p>One day, she thought, the three kids would come back and find her. They would return to Houston and reunite with the woman who fought to keep their family together.</p>
<p>Priscilla Celestine held on to that dream for years, long after the state of Texas took the children — all younger than 6 at the time — and sent them 1,300 miles away to live in a Minnesota town she didn’t know, in a home she didn’t know with a family she didn’t know.</p>
<p>The interstate adoption, finalized in 2009, was in Devonte, Jeremiah and Ciera’s best interest, the state determined. They would be safe and cared for.</p>
<p>The state was wrong.</p>
<p>“When they first took them away, it hurt so bad, but I got through that,” Celestine says. She told herself it was God’s plan. She told herself that her niece and nephews — the “jolly little kids,” the “live-as-fire kids,” the “happy babies” — would come back one day.</p>
<p>Celestine no longer dreams. Jeremiah and Ciera are dead. He was 14; she was 12. Devonte, 15, is missing and presumed dead.</p>
<p>All were killed in late March when one of their adoptive mothers, Jennifer Hart, drove an SUV over a cliff near Mendocino, Calif., and plunged into the Pacific Ocean 100 feet below — an act the local sheriff called intentional. Their other adoptive mother, Sarah Hart, and their three adopted siblings — Markis, 19, Hannah, 16, and Abigail, 14 — were also in the vehicle. They died, too.</p>
<p>Adoption records for all six children remain sealed, but publicly available documents show that warning signs were missed or ignored. Child abuse by the Harts was reported to local police in Minnesota months before the adoption of Devonte, Jeremiah and Ciera was finalized. The small Minnesota adoption agency that placed the children had a history of violations, including a failure to properly conduct home studies for pending placements. And records show that school officials and neighbors repeatedly contacted authorities with concerns and allegations.</p>
<p>Jennifer and Sarah, both 38 when they died, were a same-sex white couple. The adopted children — two sets of biological siblings — were black. Child-welfare workers visited the family on numerous occasions, but Jennifer and Sarah were able to keep the children and evade suspicion because, as one welfare worker put it in a report, “these women look normal.” Again and again, authorities trusted the parents more than they did the kids.</p>
<p>Much of the country responded the same way. When a viral photo of Devonte crying and hugging a white officer during a protest against police violence thrust the Harts into the national spotlight in 2014, many celebrated the moment as a symbol of hope for racial harmony. Few wondered whether Devonte’s tears were instead a cry for help.In Texas and Minnesota, the states involved in the adoption of the Hart children, there are no public investigations into how the adoptions were handled. Records in both states remain sealed. Six children are dead, and there is no inquiry into how they were placed in jeopardy or why they were left there.</p>
<p>Adoption experts agree that the Hart case is an extreme example of how the system has failed adopted children, but they say it also points to a need for a rigorous monitoring process by social-work agencies.“In our system, once a child is adopted, we equate it with success and there is very little follow-up,” said University of Michigan law professor Vivek Sankaram, who advocates for children’s rights. “We actually know very little about the well-being of how kids from foster care do after they are adopted.”</p>
<p>Celestine, 67, last saw the children in December 2007. She spent two hours holding them and playing with them that day, she said in an interview, and cried when it was time to go.She learned of their fate in a late-night call from her former lawyer in early April.  She put the phone down, not wanting to hear the details.</p>
<p>“No, no,” she said. “No, no.”</p>
<p>Shonda Jones, the Houston attorney she had hired to help her keep custody of the children, maintains that they never should have been taken from her in the first place.  Celestine “had brought them some normalcy, some stability, and then to just abruptly remove them without some form of warning, I just couldn’t believe it,” Jones said in an interview. “Everything about this case screamed, ‘wrong, wrong, wrong, injustice, injustice, injustice.’”</p>
<p>A single mistake</p>
<p>Devonte, Jeremiah and Ciera — along with an older brother, Dontay — became wards of the state in 2006, when a Texas court terminated the parental rights of their biological parents. Almost everyone involved in the case believes that was the right decision, Jones said. The children’s mother, Sherry Davis, was addicted to drugs, and the state documented regular instances of neglect.</p>
<p>Celestine, the sister of Jeremiah and Ciera’s father, petitioned to adopt the children in May 2007. She had a steady job. She moved into a bigger home, and the kids moved in with her in June. She bought them food and clothes and toys. Her schedule never varied: Work, home, church. Work, home, church.</p>
<p>Celestine was 56 at the time and says the young children — then 4, 3 and 2 — gave her energy.  “They kept me moving, and that’s what I needed,” she said in an interview. “And I enjoyed it. I loved it because they were little, and you could teach them.”</p>
<p>The children had been with her for about six months when she made the decision that cost her custody. Her employer called her in to work an extra shift, her lawyer said. Celestine temporarily left the children with Davis.  Celestine says she didn’t realize that violated the rules. By chance, a social worker visited the house while Davis was there with the children. The siblings were immediately removed from the home and taken into state custody.</p>
<p>“She had to go to work,” Jones said. “Does she lose her job or does she allow the mother to be with the kids? I just believe it could have been handled in a more compassionate, civil manner.”  The Texas Department of Family and Protective Services refused to comment on the case, citing confidentiality laws related to adoptions.</p>
<p>Celestine and her lawyer fought to regain custody. But it was a losing battle.  Texas officials moved quickly to find the three younger children an adoptive home. Dontay wasn’t adopted because the state determined he required placement in a mental health treatment center, Jones said.   The small percentage of adoptions that occur across state lines are governed by the Interstate Compact on the Placement of Children, a nearly 60-year-old agreement intended to ensure continuity of care. A caseworker in the destination state must complete a home study — including a review of the adoptive parents’ criminal histories, employment status and daily routines. Child-welfare agencies in both states must approve the placement.</p>
<p>Federal funding for state child-welfare systems is based in part on how quickly states move children out of foster care and into adoptive families. There is, however, no federal oversight of adoptions, either in state or between states, and there is minimal transparency on how the process works. There is almost no data to determine success or failure rates.</p>
<p>Holes in the safety net</p>
<p>Texas officials entrusted Devonte, Jeremiah and Ciera to Permanent Family Resource Center (PFRC), a small adoption agency in Fergus Falls, Minn. According to its now-defunct website, the agency was founded in 2000 by three families that had adopted multiple children and specialized in adoptions of “sibling groups and children of color.”  The adoption moved swiftly. Within six months of being removed from Celestine, court documents show, the siblings were living in Minnesota.  
</p>
<p>But while the adoption of Devonte, Jeremiah and Ciera was pending, in September 2008, Hannah Hart told a teacher that Jennifer had hit her with a belt, leaving a bruise on her arm — the first public record of many allegations of abuse. The mothers told police that the 6-year-old fell down the stairs, and the case was closed.  In February 2009, a judge approved the adoption of Devonte, Jeremiah and Ciera. Even that decision, and who made it, remains under wraps.  
</p>
<p>Within months of the approval, Minnesota cited PFRC for dozens of violations. In September 2009, the state put PFRC’s operating license on a two-year conditional status, an action that “indicates repeated and serious violations of licensing standards,” according to a spokeswoman for the Minnesota Department of Human Services. The agency closed in 2012.</p>
<p>It is unclear if any of the violations were related to the Hart family. PFRC founder Maryjane Westra did not respond to a request for an interview. Bridget Leonard, a former director, declined to comment. Minnesota DHS also would not comment on specifics of the Hart case.  A Minnesota social worker who worked with the Harts would later tell investigators at the Oregon Department of Human Resources that Texas frequently funneled children through PFRC, “even when the [Minnesota] Child Welfare office has not supported the placement.”</p>

I joined this forum because of my own background in child advocacy in the 70' s and 80's.  My colleagues and I frequently brought class actions nationwide to intervene in the terrible foster system. We were in the trenches while Hillary was making noise with the so called  Childrens Defense Fund. She couldn't litigate because she had flunked the bar exam. Anyway, husband Bill makes it to the White House and if memory serves me right the state foster care system became monetized with federal funds that practically created bounties for children.( and our funding was eliminated). Never iin my dreams would I think it would deteriorate to this. Thanks for the post.

             TY for your comment.  I have read so many sad and horrible stories but this one really went deep. There are no words that can describe what those women did to those children  And what our govt. has put in place to facilitate such horror upon innocent children.  Sadly I don't think the guilty parties will ever be punished.  Not by our court of law.  I hope somehow they start digging deep.  The Black Assassins is a really good site that is trying to red pill the masses.   The Clintons have done more to hurt and damage Our Children than any couple I know.

             I was telling a friend about the background of this story and she said it is caused by capitalism, we have to change this and change that.  But I said to her , but what about all the children that will die while we are fixing the problems.  We have to do something now or very very soon.  We can fix whatever, while we are saving the children, but the children come first.  And their parents.  The Hart Story has connections to NXIVM and the Bronfmans.  Rainbow Fests are connected to Rainbow Cultural Gardens which I believe Sara B headed in London.  There is a chapter in Montreal.  The Land of Trudeau.

             I don't know if I can explain this, but they are part of the Rainbow Group and they are connected to NXIVM in Montreal.  Rainbow Cultural Garden which wants to take over our children.  Remember when we talked about how they hired teachers that would teach children 7 languages and the children became totally confused and spoke Babble?  That is their objective.  To really screw up the word and Our Children.  God help us.  And God help them when the people find out.  Find out how deep and mixed up it really is.  It's like a big bowl of spaghetti.

             AND this is why WaPo has so kindly allowed us to see the Dirty Linen of CPS and the Foster Care Syst.   BECAUSE they want to create an ILLUSION because they are hiding something way worse.
            </p>
            <p>
             In this era of the dark satanic circles of America, corporate mass media want us to be blind, and believe the ILLUSION that a series of coincidental and random governmental oversight breakdowns over 10 years across four states, Texas, Minnesota, Oregon and Washington, contributed to the deaths of the black children.
            </p>
            <p>
             Also this MAN tells us that the part in the article about the little girl's head under cold water he calls it Waterboarding.  Well, I never.  That's exactly what it was. To a Child.  Well, no matter it was just a Black Child, Right?  Tears :(

             THIS MAN IS WOKE - The Hart Witches
            </p>
            <p>
             Jennifer and Sarah Hart (Witches of Buchenwald) are not the story of optimistic “do gooder” and “dreamer” white “All American Lesbian Couple” that overwhelmed themselves in a heroic struggle to help and rescue 6 (six) black drug babies. It is an ILLUSION provided to the mass public blind. What is not an ILLUSION or subject to blindness is that 6 (six) beautiful black children (human beings) had been all been racially targeted, enslaved for possible ILLUMINATI- NAZI SS Black Sun organ harvesting. The white “All American Lesbian Couple” had more love and respect for their pet dogs, cats and animals then black children. They were cold blood wicked female Knights and SS like concentration camp wardens that treated the Children less than their pets and animals to demonstrate their zeal to hate and destroy black people, their religion and culture for all the world to see.

             I am still reading about this man's life.  I wanted to share this.
            </p>
            <p>
             My father had been a pre WW II civilian employee at the U.S. Army Supply Depot in Oakland, then transferred to the U.S. Naval Air Station in Alameda, CA. One day, he went to work then disappeared. My mother and family couldn’t find him. He had been taken. I am not sure when my mother and family finally found him at Napa State Hospital. They were all a respected very humble hard working Christian people out of Mississippi and Louisiana close to the soil of the earth. The people that took my father from his family was U.S. Naval MC Lt. Charles Savage at Bethesda, head of Naval Intelligence ultra secret mind control program, Project CHATTER. They told me in no uncertain terms that I would be dead before I get any documented evidence or help me in any way to put pieces together to the puzzle that Project CHATTER took him.

           <p>
            CPS needs a complete overhaul

           <p>
            an investigation into many adoptions and foster homes is needed asap

            these kids deserve better

            dont think we will ever know the whole truth on this family

            didnt know about the aunt, at least for a time, they were loved and cared for

             I was shocked to see the article actually.  Am very surprised that WaPo is exposing CPS's Dirty Linen.  Yes, we will never know.  So sad.  We are losing them all different ways.

             <p>
              when they do a story on the CPS as a whole, how they have let so many dead children down, then will I believe they care
             </p>
             <p>
              makes you wonder why they did it though
             </p>
             <p>
              Timing?
             </p>
             <p>
              if you listed all the dead children that died because CPS dropped the ball, it would probaly take days to read, add what happened to abuser, and I think something just might get done
             </p>
             <p>
              at CPS, they are not all corrupt, most are understaffed, underpaid and undereducated, with many having their hands tied behind their backs
             </p>
             <p>
              was a time welfare people just popped in for check in, they didnt have to make appointment

               I wonder if they are setting us up for something.  Will they blame this on Trump.  LOL.  That would be the laugh of the century.  Walter Mondale, Bill Clinton and Newt Gingrich were the ones responsible for the part that allowed payments for placements.  Nancy Schaeffer exposed it and her and her husband were allegedly murdered for it.  I don't trust WaPo.

             There was a Washington police state power- child protective services stand down not a breakdown, and nobody responded to our so dear and precious Tiny Hannah’s heart wrenching cry for human compassion and help. On or about May 10, 2018, a Mendocino County’s sheriff’s deputy was called to the area of North Highway 1 and Hardy Creek in Westport around 7:15 p.m. Wednesday. On an ocean beach, a local resident found a pair of girl’s jeans with a shoe entangled in one of the pant legs. An inspection led to discovering human remains of what appeared to be a human foot inside of the shoe. The remains were found about a mile away from where the Hart SUV plunged over a cliff onto rocks at the edge of the ocean on March 25 or March 26, 2018. The foot was delivered to Mendocino County’s Coroners, Knights Templar Sheriff Tom Allman and Sex Cult Guru Lt. Shannon Barney.
            </p>
            <p>
             As far as I am aware, Allman and Barney have not released to the public any final reports detailing autopsy findings of Jennifer, Sarah Hart and the Children. And, I suspect that they will not release any detailed autopsy findings in the case that indicate whether or not the Children had any vital organs. And as far as I am aware, the alleged bodies of Jennifer, Sarah Hart and the Children have been cremated and permanently disposed of.
            </p>
            <p>
             In lieu of the pending DNA tests on the foot, our most precious Tiny Hannah is still missing, presumed dead. I had suspected that only the body parts of Tiny Hannah and Devonte would be recovered, because I believe that they had sacrificed, organs removed- harvested, and bodies burned. It seems to me that the Children’s forced special malnourished diet had something to do with harvesting and marketing their organs to an elite class.

             Yes, there will be many tears shed over these children and the people that failed them.  I said to my husband, can you imagine a little child jumping out of a window to escape that place, running into our house and hiding for fear to go back and not calling to report.  He said no.  I can't even imagine.  I would call the police and every org. I could.   So very hard to deal with.

              And it was another gay couple adopting kids .  And I’m wondering where they got all the money to afford
The lifestyle they kept , of traveling and going on adventures .  Jen stayed at home while her wife worked and she took care of the kids 
This article tells a lot .

              My mind is really getting carried away here but , notice in the article how they use the race card .
From the article...
“But eventually, Jen Hart did not view school as a safe place for him or his brothers. She said they were discriminated against because of their race and parents. Devonte faced the “worst of the worst,” she wrote in April 2010. ”
             </p>
             <p>
              Were they given huge incentives (being a gay couple ) to adopt kids ? Something really stinks about the whole “ gays adopting “ kids stuff .  Article also makes mention of “ black lives matter “

              </p>
              <p>
               Bakhtiar is torn over what may have happened. Tests showed Jen Hart’s blood alcohol level was above the legal limit. Her wife Sarah and two of the children had high amounts of Benadryl in their system.
              </p>
              <p>
               Hart’s father, from whom she was distant, believes something went terribly wrong.
              </p>
              <p>
               There are ways to insert alcohol and medication into the body.   A coroner or med. prof. would know how to do that.  Call me crazy, I don't care, but  I will never believe the story they are trying to push. NEVER.   I remember in one of the posts about them, that someone posted a picture of one of the women after the accident at a store.  Possibly Walmart or similar.  WHERE ARE THE CHILDREN?   I don't give a Rat's Behind about those two women except that I want them LOCKED UP.

               I have had a sinking feeling about there being more to this than meets the eye.  BLM being linked to Soros and the types of Fests and Events those two women took the kids to is a tip off that something else was going on.  Those women wee able to afford their lifestyle because of the huge amount of money they received monthly for housing foster children.  Foster children that were stolen from someone that was providing a loving home.  There is something rotten here.  The Texas agency and the foster placement agency PFRC that was shut down should be researched.  Why is there such secrecy about THIS adoption of children?  TOTAL COVER UP.
              </p>
              <p>
               Yes, those women were racists.  They used those kids.  Imo, they hated them.  They only took them in because they were given the opportunity and BING! they realized the money they would pull in and to have a much more upscale lifestyle.  I don't think these women just happened on THESE kids.  There is something else going on behind the scenes.  Also we will never know if those women went over that cliff or the Children either.  That whole area and LE is complicit.  I do not trust Sheriff Allman one bit.  Sheriff AND the Coroner.  Hmm.

                   What upsets me most about those two women is not that they were lesbians but that they used their sexual preference and the Black Children to further their Normalization Propaganda.  They were hooked up to BLM, connected with Soros, so wonder if that all played into what they were up to.

                    😮 look what the parents of the baby that just died are doing ! They are saying that vaccines are important and that their baby wouldn’t have died if the person who gave him the meningitis would have been VACCINATED! Oh this stinks .. if I lost my 4 month old baby , I would not be advocating for the CDC! This smells like an act now .. ?

                       Parents selling off their children.  Yes, it does remind of SH.  It never ceases to amaze me that some parents can stoop so low.

                    I feel the same way .. it’s that they used it to further their financial gain . And used the kids to say “ look at us , we’re so great “ ....oh that miningitis story ! We know what vaccines are really for now . I wonder if the one who injected him knew that would be lethal? And of course a lot of daycares are in cahoots with the government, so they have to push the whole “ required vaccination “ scam . You know what I find odd? This just popped into my head .. where I moved to , the zoning only allows certain businesses without hardly any questioning daycares and recovery homes were 2 of the handful listed . I will look more into it , but why in a rural area do they have these listed as main ones ? It’s strange to me .. just wanted to drop that in case we uncover some link in the future . I could be just overly cautious..

                       Yes and if you read that whole article you will see there is a Bronfman connection.  Rainbow Cultural Gardens in Montreal where the Bronfmans hold court and with NXIVM   The Hart women took those kids to Rainbow Fest and were mixed up with the Shambala garbage it's all crazy.

                         There is so much to read always.  But I would rather know than not know.  It certainly isn't pleasant either.

                           The organ harvesting post last week really tore us apart.  We had to read so many horrible articles and decide which one would work.  Now this week the Family.  But I am glad to be able to share it, no matter how bad.  It's the only way the truth will get out.

                 There is so much of this happening across the country.  It all sickens me.  Last week I was sickened by all of Our Children we have lost to organ harvesting and now this.  They are KILLING OUR CHILDREN.  They want to KILL OUR FUTURE.    Beyond Evil.  Profoundly Immoral.

            Thanks for posting this, carmencita. This was just so wrong in so many ways. If we keep banging the gong, maybe people will wake up to CPS corruption.

             Thank You. Of all places I was so surprised to find this on the MSN page.  MSM of all things.  We can hope many people saw the article and got the message.

             Very strange timing, indeed. And where are details of their deaths in a county hundreds of miles from their home? There is so much here that has been omitted, the entire article creates only more confusion.
            </p>
            <p>
             Also, did you see Eugene Robinson's op/ed accusing the Trump Administration of 'kidnapping children'?

              Hah!  Eugene used to be one of my favorites.  Throw him under the bus for lying about our children.  He is another sell out of his own people.  Yes, everything is sealed.  There are no records to be accessed.  It is all a big secret.  And WHY?  I want to know WHY.  I have my ideas as to why they come to take those children from their home.  It was a set up.  Just happened to come the day after they were with their mother.  CPS wanted those children.  I am getting sick all over again.  Let WaPo got to HE77.
