<p>Read the story, check out the pictures and look at the comments:</p>
<p>&quot;Its like you read my mind! You appear to know a lot about this, like you wrote the book in it or something. I think that you can do with a few pics to drive the message home a little bit, but other than that, this is fantastic blog. A great read. I will definitely be back.&quot; </p>
<p>&quot;You really make it seem so easy with your presentation but I find this topic to be actually something which I think I would never understand. It seems too complex and very broad for me. I’m looking forward for your next post, I will try to get the hang of it!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I think this website holds some rattling fantastic information for everyone :D . “Do not go where the path may lead, go instead where there is no path and leave a trail.” by Ralph Waldo Emerson.&quot;</p>
<p>Note the picture with the circles around Dyrdek, and Berrics and Toddy G\'s pizza - it forms a penis with balls. </p>
<p>I looked into Dyrdek and it looks like Tosh. O (the cable TV celebrity) called out Rob Dyrdek (host of MTV/Ridiculousness) for pedophilia. </p>

            Update - Dyrdek has since shutdown Fun Factory and Toddy G's has morphed into another Pizza place. In the final episode of Fun Factory, he had children on his show by way of the Make a Wish Foundation, a sketchy organization in itself.
