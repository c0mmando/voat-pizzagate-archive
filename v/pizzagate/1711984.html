            I believe it and the Secret Service agents kept it all a secret they cover up real crimes inside the White House all the time that's the really sad part. They don't expose what goes on.

            Tolkien definately steadied us for this fight did he not? His vision of what made people good or evil still resonates. The Hobbits were good because they knew that their mission would likely fail, but that was not a factor in their chosing to go on their quest. It was simply the right thing to do, and hope of reward or fear of failure were not to be considered. Fight the long defeat if need be, but do the right thing and do not look back.

             YES. God dammit yes this exactly. It doesn't even matter if we lose in the end because if you can't even stand and fight for something like this you don't deserve the BEAUTY this world has to offer. The Hobbits knew that if they didn't leave, the Shire was doomed, and if they did leave there was the smallest chance at victory that anyone ever had, yet they went anyway because they knew it was right. They would not have been able to live with themselves had they not tried and we won't be able to either. Great comment.

            I'd like to take a poll - if you have ever read the entire book "Alice In Wonderland" please say so.

           <p>
            Not a movie, storybook, video, or other take off.   Just the book.  I'm expecting close to no responses btw.

             The question then arises: Where are the photos of this super-secret Phase Three?   Fear not! For I have those as well. Yet a different gallery at Imagebam has two photos from the final part of the evening, showing Depp out of costume (and Burton still sporting his eye-patch), posing with a White House staffer (whom I don't recognize at the moment). Here are photos from the last phase of the Halloween event:

            further proof the submission is misleading and innaccurate - the OP states there are no photos from the third stage of the party, but their own evidence discusses two photos from that part of the party.   Please add that to the argument that this post needs to be taken down for innaccuracy - that is not censorship.

             Your right, there was some pictures at phase 3 but it was still a private party. We don't know exactly how long the party went on and if there was a 4th phase to the party. Obama tried to keep this party a secret according to multiple articles, and tried to hide Johnny Depp from the visitor log according to this article:

            In the first group picture BO is the only one not in costume.  Odd.  I remember seeing him in a picture in the exact same type of outfit sweater with shirt, collar inside, playing ping pong with a young boy.  Wonder if that is from this party.

              I am going to very carefully watch your proof video which is the lynchpin of your entire series of posts - called "johnny Depp is a Pedophile" or something along those lines - and look for that "smoking gun" you said was in it.  Right now. This is going to blow my mind, right?  Because a video on you tube that actually proves Depp is a pedophile is important evidence.

              This article was published in 2009 - SEVEN years ago.  what were the results?  They "launched an investigation" so what did they find out?  How much taxpayer money was spent on WH entertainment and WHAT LINK DOES THAT HAVE WITH THE CARTEL OF CHILD TRAFFICKING AT ALL?  Establish a link and you've got something.

             Yes, however this freak Obunghole ordered $65k in hotdogs and pizza to the WH. Ping Pong playing with kids in the WH. JA has been documened at the WH. Was Podesta at any of these parties? We have legitimate reasons to have concerns.

             So it's not suspicious that he had a private party in 2009 with $65,000 worth of hot dogs/cheese pizza, which are the code words for little boys/little girls?

            This is an abuse of this boad and why mods allow this serously makes me wonder what is going on here with this poster and the so called rules of this board - why is there such selective enforcement?  How is this pizzagate related in any way other than the most threadbare speculation?

            A President had a Halloween theme party for staff and their children and invited movie stars in costume, plus the famous director.   That does not make this a pedo party automatically.  Where is the evidence that any of the people involved with this are pedophiles, including the Obamas?

            I hate this finger pointing nonsense - get something real and with teeth or stop wasting our time.  Yes Alice in Wonderland has been known to be used for MK Ultra programming.  This is responsibly discussed at Vigilent Citizan website.

             Technically this does not break any of the sub rules, so really it's up to the community to decide. Voat is inherently anti-censorship so as long as the post follows the rules, it has to be left up, even if we think it's utter crap, haha.

             Wrong - you're referring to the outdoor part of the event, but this article was talking about the other phase of the event - "As the description from the Burton Land commenter above reveals, there were three phases to the event: First, an outdoor party with kids and trick-or-treating (at which all the press photos were taken); then a private party inside the White House with Jonny Depp and all the "Alice in Wonderland" cast members in costume (at which the photos above were all taken); and finally an even more exclusive ultra-private adults-only affair at the end of the evening at which Depp (and the rest of the cast) had changed back into normal clothes." -

              No you are wrong.  There are pictures of the "super-sekret" party - read your own posts and follow your own links!   They feature a white house staffer in a two shot with Depp and then with Burton.  So what?    From your own evidence -

            The media were at the party. Weird to argue that they were trying to keep it a secret.

            Maybe they didn't want photos published because many of the kids were from military families.

            Yes, "Intra-species predation" was the video that made me see the whole. The one thing I could not understand until then was "Why?" Why are they doing this? It's because they are psychopaths hellbent on fulfilling only their desires at the expense of EVERYONE AND EVERYTHING else.

            It is alleged that Lewis Carroll, the author of "Alice in Wonderland' was involved with pedophilia, and took several nudes of Alice's older sister and sold them to a private collector in France.

            GENIUS!!! Really a great find. It's unbelievable how the press gave him all this leeway. Can imagine if Trump tried this ... The press has been complicit in this. It's the blood of these children's innocence they have on their hands. Any mature adult would question why a POTUS would be throwing parties for little boys outside of the normal Easter themed events. Really would be more of a First Lady thing to do. And it would be a major photo op to get out press about how nice they are.

            "Alice in Wonderland" author Lewis Carroll was rumoured to be a pedophile. TONS on the net about it if someone wanted to compile. No doubt there are YouTube vids about the symbolism of Alice in Wonderland which is an Illuminati favourite.

             First of all, the WikiLeaks emails show that Obama had a private party with $65,000 worth of hot dogs/cheese pizza in 2009, which are pedophile code works for little boys/girls. Second, I simply found articles talking about private parties that Obama had in 2009. One party was alice in wonderland themed, and we all know Alice in Wonderland is connected to pedophilia symbols. If this is not evidence, then please find me better evidence. This could lead to even more evidence being found and it has already helped me connect Johnny Depp and Tim Burton to the Hollywood Pedophile elite. (Since they attended Obama's private party)

            Alice in Wonderland and Wizard of Oz have both been used extensively in mind control programming. Among other reasons, they promote the idea that there is another way reality can be, where everything is different than what is customary. They also provide many memes that can be used as triggers. I know of one recycled programmer who learnt his craft in the military and took it into his criminal venue. He carried Alice and WoOz costumes and paraphernalia in the trunk of his car. He'd go to a flea market and break out that stuff. He'd riff through verbal triggers and watch closely for a reaction. He would actually find new slaves that way.

            The "Obama's" were tying to "keep up with the Bush's", remember all the scandals from both the Bush's, like the younger hiring his "boy toy" Jeff Gannon a known prostitute as a "secret service" on our dime to keep him close? And the public had no access to the internet, so if you missed the paper "breaking the story" you were in the dark, or had to wait until it was updated in the library. If it ever was. Thank God for the internet.

            interesting enough. Listen to the first part of this video. Then go through the comments. He was asked anonymously to come to the white house. Then he was told not to share until Obama was out of the White house. Casey Neistat uploaded this video !/28/17. This was back from 2012.  Scroll down to "Mike Hunt's" comment.

            Does this mean Johnny Depp is involved with pedophilia too? Or am I not to jump to this conclusion? The worst part is, I actually know someone who works for him during his filming of movies. She's never said one bad word about him, she actually says he's a good guy. Now I wonder about my friend. Crap.

              Are you serious? Why do people in this forum feel the need to be negative? I'm just wondering. The only reason I stay here is because I want this to end, I want children to be able to be children, to run free and be happy without a bunch of sickos kidnapping them. But then I get condescending, unwarranted comments like this. It would be nice to just share information, learn and figure out how we can stop them. But no. You have to deal with this. Amazing.

               you are not a prisoner and are free to leave.  You sound negative to me.  We are "just wondering' just like you.  This is a discussion forum, and if you are not prepared to discuss what you have to say, your instincts are correct -it is not the place for you.

                Also why would you encourage people to leave? You are new here too. You would think you'd want people to open there eyes to this scourge of humanity and share what they know? I just don't understand why people feel the need to make unwarranted and unsolicited negative comments.

            Lewis Carroll -- yet another sad realization since my discovering PG -- is a hero of the pedo community.  Carroll was known for 'befriending' young girls, taking inappropriate photos of them, and abandoning them as they reached puberty.

             Wow that's horrible. And interesting because the other day there was an article about an underground temple that had been discovered in the UK and used for rituals etc, and the entrance to it was disguised as a rabbit hole. I owndered if maybe that was a common way of disguising these places where these creatures would go and do their sick stuff and sacrifice children, and that maybe that was where the expression 'down the rabbit hole' came from. And maybe it was, maybe there was a reason Lewis Carroll incorporated a rabbit hole into his story.

              Hollywood and Lewis Carroll are two examples of smoke.  To get to fire, as in evidence of a crime, requires harder evidence.  But I have almost no reasons to give anyone in Hollywood the benefit of the doubt.  It's so bad out there Wood and Feldman issued dire warnings.

             hang in there, this is all MEANT to come out now, the term "apocolypse" mean revealing what has been hidden. I'm not religious, but there certainly appears to be a great revealing eh? SO... we must be patient and stay focused, these people are doomed and the

             chance they have is we get hopeless and give up. So when you feel down, and the world is gone mad, come here for some responsibility, integrity, and decency.

             This is why we
             <strong>
              must
             </strong>
             be strong. This is the most difficult thing humanity has ever faced. Make no mistake, it is the ROOT OF ALL PROBLEMS because it shows that these people are PREDATORS above all else. They are humans preying on humans. Preying on our fears and desires. Preying on our insecurities. But they know the number one thing they can prey on to destroy us, OUR CHILDREN. BECAUSE THE CHILDREN
             <strong>
              ARE THE FUTURE
             </strong>
             . By controlling us and our children with FEAR, they CONTROL THE FUTURE. Killing or raping someone's child is the ultimate power move in nature. It asserts dominance more than ANYTHING ELSE COULD. INCLUDING JUST KILLING THE PERSON. Because what they now have is CONTROL. They now control you with FEAR. BREAK THE FEAR. Do not be scared. BE COURAGEOUS, THIS IS THE DARKEST THING YOU HAVE EVER FACED. NOTHING ELSE WILL COMPARE AFTER THIS.
            </p>
            <p>
             KNOW THAT YOU ARE CARRYING THE LIGHT. You are carrying within you something greater than they could ever comprehend. And because of that reason they WILL BE DEFEATED. They do not understand their enemy, so the faster we understand them, the faster victory comes.
            </p>
            <p>
             Everyone must be secure in themselves and know that they are not one of these monsters. We must all be soldiers, we must all be detectives, we must all be the police of our society. Above ALL though we must be
             <strong>
              friends, family, brothers, sisters, cousins, HUMANS
             </strong>
             . These people ARE NOT HUMAN. I don't mean they are shapeshifting lizards. I mean that they lack EMPATHY. They lack COMPASSION. They lack all understanding of what it means to be a loving person, a sharing person, a GOOD person. They don't give a flying fuck about anything but their own desires and will stop at NOTHING to continue fulfilling those desires. They are blackmailing each other to make sure that they all stay focused. If even a single one of them decides they have had enough, the entire network is fucked. That is why they murder, blackmail, rape, threaten, kidnap, traffic everything from drugs to humans to weapons to gold. They are trying to hypnotize us to buy into their desires so that when the big reveal comes they can say "Look! You guys are all doing it too!" They want to blur the lines between good and evil and make us believe that it's okay. It's not okay.
            </p>
            <p>
             Your heart may be heavy and that is fully understandable. My heart is heavy too. All of ours are. What we must do is BEAR THE WEIGHT TOGETHER. We must bear it as one. We must all carry the weight of The One Ring, march directly into Mordor and cast it in the fire. There can be no other path just as in Middle Earth. It MUST be done. We have to face the 'black tapes' of humanity and instead of letting the blackness consume us we must shine our light on it until it has been ANNIHILATED.

            </p>
            <p>
             MY FINAL POINT: WE MUST BE WILLING TO ACCEPT THAT ALL MUST BE RESET. ALL MUST BE TORN DOWN AND REBUILT. WE CAN'T BE SCARED OF WHAT MIGHT COME NEXT BECAUSE WE ARE THE ONES WHO WILL CREATE IT AND WE KNOW THAT WE ARE LOVE INCARNATE OR WE WOULDN'T BE HERE. THIS SYSTEM IS NOT WORKING AND IT MUST BE DESTROYED. IT DOES NOT MATTER WHAT COMES AFTER BECAUSE IT WILL BE BETTER THAN THIS. DEATH IS BETTER THAN THIS AND I WOULD RATHER CHOOSE THAT THAN LIVE IN A WORLD LIKE THIS. BUT I WILL NEVER TAKE MY OWN LIFE BECAUSE THAT IS SURRENDER. I WILL NEVER CONCEDE THIS UNTIL THERE IS NO MORE BREATH IN MY BODY.

              it is the end of an era of darkness. greek sophists spoke of this time, the hindu yugas. we are experiencing a shift in civilization towards a greater good. these systems are going to be torn down. it is written into our existence.

              But everywhere we turn - be it the state or the church, the media or the schools, we are taught one thing above all else, the virtue of subjugating our-self to mortals who claim to have the right to rule over us, but when these things, people, institutions... when they break your spirit and take pleasure in watching you bleed... hate is the only feeling what makes sense, but i know what hate does to a man. Rips him apart, turns him, something promised we would never become. In that life we have no future, all what we have is distraction,sorrow and remorse.
             </p>
             <p>
              Theirs an old saying, that which doesn't kill you makes you stronger, i don't believe that, i think the things that try to kill you make you angry and sad, puts you in a dark place, strength comes from the good things, your family, your friends, people like you, the efforts of good people here at Voat, those are the things what will keep me whole, those are the things to keep hold of when your broken. Thank you for such wise words.

               I don't exactly disagree with you. For a long time I was like that too. I didn't believe that I could become stronger out of the things that hurt me. I thought I needed to lean on my friends and family to take the pain away. To distract me from it. But what I came to realize was that I was afraid. I was paralyzed with fear. I did not want to look inward and seek the answers that would free me from that mental prison. I WANTED to be the eternal victim. Always feeling sorry for myself, always knowing that it was okay I was doing nothing because in the end 'nothing was worth it and we are already defeated.'
              </p>
              <p>
               I thought I was the most worthless human being who
               <strong>
                EVER
               </strong>
               lived. I gave myself no breaks. Every mistake was a death sentence in my mind. The thing that changed my entire life was an accident at work. Unfortunate as it was, as much as I suffered in my recovery, it made me stronger than ANYTHING else in the world. There was a time where I could not leave my bed and all I could do was weep because I realized that I was not able to do the things I loved anymore (physically). I used to make excuses for not doing the things I loved, the main one was that I didn't deserve anything good in this world. After months of this, in the darkest depths of my pit of despair, I made my decision. Never again. Never again will I feel sorry for myself. Never again will I let the good things slip away and allow hatred, anger, and fear to control me. Never again will I make excuses. Never again will I subjugate myself to anyone else. There can be no concession in this.
              </p>
              <p>
               Now that I am on the other side of my pain, my shame, my worthlessness, I know what must be done. I can never stop working towards what I consider to be paradise, internally and externally. Who else is going to do it for me? We must be strong in the face of adversity and when you meet it head on it does make you stronger because you are honing skills to overcome challenges. The skills I am talking about are a combination of mental and physical. You have to train your body and mind to withstand all external evil and pain. You have to believe in yourself above ALL else. Because YOU are YOU and nobody else is. You are a being in this world and nobody is going to swoop in and save you from every challenge you face. The only person you can trust in your hardest trials and tribulations, in facing your greatest fears.. is yourself. The hardest steel is forged in the hottest fires.
              </p>
              <p>
               On a final note I will say that the love and support of friends and family are what allow you to move forward. The decisions have to come internally, but it is okay to lean on the people who love you and vice versa. You can allow them to lean on you in their time of need. Ultimately this is what makes us stronger than they are. But before we can lean on each other we must build ourselves up.

              You wish it only this deep.  Pedogate is merely the tool used to control politicians.  If it wasn't little kids they might use MK Ultra techniques instead.  Civilization won't be safe so long as these people are pulling strings.

               MK Ultra is ONE of their tools that they are using to keep control, same as pedophilia, same as drugs, weapons, money, etc. They are using tools to keep control in a society that has evolved.
              </p>
              <p>
               FEAR IS PARALYZING. They want you to be afraid and they are using many tools as possible to keep you scared. You can be afraid or you can be strong and face your fears. Those are the only two options.
              </p>
              <p>
               Pedogate is ONE cog in a giant mechanism of fear and hatred. All of their tools are connected as one and they must ALL be dismantled. Pedogate is simply the one that will spark people to understand.

               Also you clearly didn't even read my post because if you did you will see that I unequivocally stated that they aren't just raping and murdering our children. They are trying to CONTROL

             Trust me, I hear you. With all the research I've been doing lately, its made me feel like slamming my laptop; however we need to put our personal feelings aside because its not about us, its about the innocent children who can't defend themselves. So what I do is when I feel like I'm about to break, I take a break. They need us.

              More than even the children. The entire world is being victimized by phony wars, phony elections, phony media, you name it. This cult controls western society and even has powerfful banks in place in Russia and seems to have infiltrated asian countries as well.  They likely are responsible for all unnecessary world suffering. I can't see how it can be otherwise.

            2009 WND 'White House nightlife under investigation'
“Barack and Michelle Obama have been throwing taxpayer funded parties nearly every night with their ‘friends’ and supporters, with Michelle Obama even exhorting them not to ‘break’ White House property,” Klayman’s announcement said.
“This party atmosphere sends the wrong message to the American people. As the Obama-Clinton crowd party on, the American people are suffering greatly,” Klayman said.
“It was right to criticize corporate execs for using taxpayer bailout money on bonuses and corporate junkets. In the face of this criticism, it is an outrage for Barack and Michelle Obama to party on, as Rome burns. It’s like throwing a party at a funeral,” he said.
According to a report by the news and commentary website Politico, many of the parties have been just that – parties, not political and government meetings."

              Obama and Michelle Antoinette partied on in secret, knowing the recession stricken country would be disgusted. ..."It was so over the top that “Star Wars” creator George Lucas sent the original Chewbacca to mingle with invited guests."
“White House officials were so nervous about how a splashy, Hollywood-esque party would look to jobless Americans — or their representatives in Congress, who would soon vote on health care — that the event was not discussed publicly and Burton’s and Depp’s contributions went unacknowledged,” the book says.
However, the White House made certain that more humble Halloween festivities earlier that day — for thousands of Washington-area schoolkids — were well reported by the press corps.
Then the Obamas went inside, where an invitation-only affair for children of military personnel and White House administrators unfolded in the East Room. 
Unbeknownst to reporters, the State Dining Room had also been transformed into a secretive White House Wonderland. 
Tim Burton decorated it “in his signature creepy-comic style. His film version was about to be released, and he had turned the room into the Mad Hatter’s tea party, with a long table set with antique-looking linens, enormous stuffed animals in chairs, and tiered serving plates with treats like bone-shaped meringue cookies,” reports the book, which The Post purchased at a Manhattan bookstore."

            Good find.  I'm surprised it wasn't a Wizard of Oz party.  I thought AiW MK-Ultra programming was passe.
           </p>
           <p>
            Anyway, the dates don't match up.  The AiW party was held on Halloween (10/31) 2009.  The email in question was dated May 2009 and references the $65K "hot dog" bill as being in the past.

             April 25 is reportedly Alice Day or pedo pride day.  The email was May 14th, 2009.

             In 2010, there was a congressional picnic at the White House. The theme was " Taste of the States".
            </p>
            <p>
             The White House was preparing for its annual congressional picnic  for last Tuesday and they wanted Chicago-style hots on the menu. Only catch, the staff didn't know how to make them, reports Lynn Sweet at the Sun-Times.
So the White House staff got in touch with Byron's Hot Dogs owner Mike Payne and flew him to the White House to assist the kitchen staff in preparing hot dogs for Tuesday’s annual congressional picnic.
            </p>
            <p>
             But yet Obama sent out for $65K for " Hot Dogs"
            </p>
            <p>
             It has been said all food must be made by the White House staff
            </p>
            <p>
             This must have been a very private  party Obama had

             Well I also added another article from March 2009 about private parties that have happened since the beginning of Barack's inauguration:
             <a href="http://www.wnd.com/2009/03/90945/">
              http://www.wnd.com/2009/03/90945/
             </a>
             Also, whose to say that the pedophile parties stopped after may 2009? There's probably more that happened even after. We need to investigate every single private party at the white house
