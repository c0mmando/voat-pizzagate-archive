                 Well, im not going to learn french to read it even if it contains the recipe for the elixir of immortality. However, it does not necessary validates a book that its movie adaptation is cancelled. Most books are too complex to make a movie from it and have the audience understand the meaning and you could argue that an important book should be read and not eviscerated by making a dumb movie from it. In my experience, nothing is really hidden, or is hidden in plain sight by making a movie about it. If you ban something, people will get curious why it is banned. Having it in french is close enough to banning anyway. I would need to read it to form an argument further about its content.

             28% OF CERVICAL CANCER FOUND IN CHINA
            </p>
            <p>
             "A shortage of human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine in China has led thousands of women to seek treatment in neighboring countries, causing price increases and vaccine shortages, reports the Financial Times (FT).
            </p>
            <p>
             This is important since 28% of the world’s cervical cancer patients are reported to be in China.
            </p>
            <p>
             These Chinese women are concerned they will not be able to complete their vaccinations on schedule to prevent cervical cancer.
            </p>
            <p>
             The Chinese market currently features Merck's original Gardasil, which protects against just 4 types of HPV, and Cervarix from GlaxoSmithKline, which protects against 2 types.
            </p>
            <p>
             It appears that during October 2017, Gardasil 9 became ‘temporarily on limited supply.’ Merck, Gardasil’s manufacturer, said they ‘expect this vaccine shortage to continue through July 2018.’ "

             Determinants of cervical human papillomavirus infection:differences between high and low onocogenic risk types, PK Chang et al, J Infect Dis 185(1):28, 2002.
A survey of Hong Kong women who participated in cervical cancer screening found that the overall prevalence of HPV was 7.3%. Previous induced abortion was an 87% statistically significant increased risk for HPV for women at high risk for HPV, a 51% statistically significant increased risk for women with any HPV, and a 97% statistically significant increased risk for women with unknown risk for HPV. Other risk factors for HPV included lifetime number of sexual partners, smoking, and having smokers in the family.

             "Induced Abortion in Taiwan," P.D. Dong, R.S. Lin, J. Royal Soc. Health 100-108, April, 1995
In a study of 17,047 women in Taipei, Taiwan who attended family planning services centers in 1991-1992 55% of the women had a normal Pap smear, 44% had an atypical finding and only 0.9% had dysplasia. A significantly positive trend was found between those women having had increasing numbers of induced abortions and the incidence of cervical dysplasia (P&lt;0.01)

A Norwegian study found that 6.1% of induced abortion applicants had human papillomavirus (HPV) infection. The proportion of high-risk HPV was 89.7%. HPV appears to be a risk factor for cervical cancer.

             "Induced abortion as cancer risk factor: a review of epidemiological evidence," Larissa I. Remennick, J. Epidemiol Community Health 44(4): 259-264, Dec. 1990.
This article reviewed several studies on women in the Soviet Union and surrounding areas. It was reported that the majority of cervical cancers in Armenia were registered in three cities where induced abortion rates have been high. Where induced abortion rates have been lower in other regions, cervical cancer incidence has also been lower. Similarly, induced abortion and cervical cancer is high in migrant women, while cervical cancer and induced abortion is low in indigenous women. The author suggested that mechanisms of induced abortion influence on cervical carcinogenessis may be multiple. The first mode of action may be via general endocrine stress in the reproductive system resulting from termination of pregnancy related processes. Another is through mechanical trauma and possible infection associated with the dilation and curettage or incomplete evacuation of the embryo and placenta. Chronic inflammatory lesions may arise in cervical tissue on the site of this trauma, as well as cell abnormalities. In the course of time, the latter may undergo malignant transformation and/or facilitate the action of exogenous carcinogenic agents.

A case-control study of inner city women in a Bronx, New York hospital during 1986-88 found that infection with human papillomaviris (HPV) was the major risk factor for cervical squamous intraepithelial lesions."

            <p>
             The Design Futures Council is an interdisciplinary network of design, product, and construction leaders exploring global trends, challenges, and opportunities to advance innovation and shape the future of the industry and environment. Members include architecture and design firms, building product manufacturers, service providers, and forward-thinking AEC firms of all sizes that take an active interest in their future.
            </p>
            <p>
             In 1993-94, at the
             <strong>
              Smithsonian Castle on the East Coast and at the Salk Institute on the West Coast
             </strong>
             , a network of regional and national design firms began sharing ideas, benchmarks, and proprietary financial analysis with each another.
            </p>
            <p>
             ..During this time, Greenway Consulting was working with other clients allied to the design professions who became enthusiastic about supporting the network. Those clients included Cecil Steward of the University of Nebraska, Doug Parker of Steelcase, Jonas Salk of the Salk Institute, Jerry Hobbs and Paul Curran of BPI/VNU Communications, and Arol Wolford of CMD. In addition, principal leaders from Gensler; Skidmore, Owings and Merrill; Hammel, Green and Abrahamson; Perkins and Will; CommArts; and two dozen other firms provided leadership vision and energy.
            </p>
            <p>
             Shortly thereafter, this leadership network officially became the Design Futures Council. They met in the offices of Greenway Consulting in Washington, D.C., and in meeting rooms at the Smithsonian Institution’s Castle. Invitations for programs and sharing of ideas came from the American Institute of Architects, the American Consulting Engineers Council, the Industrial Designers Society of America, the Aga Khan Trust for Culture, the World Future Society, the International Interior Design Association, the American Society of Interior Designers, the Design-Build Institute, the Design Management Institute, and many colleges and universities.

             David Magie Childs (born April 1, 1941) is an American architect and chairman emeritus of the architectural firm Skidmore, Owings &amp; Merrill.[1] He is best known for being
             <strong>
              the architect of the new One World Trade Center in New York City
             </strong>
             ......
            </p>
            <p>
             His major projects include: in Washington, D.C., 1201 Pennsylvania Avenue,
             <strong>
              the Four Seasons Hotel
             </strong>
             , master plans for the National Mall, the U.S. News and World Report headquarters, and the headquarters for National Geographic; in New York City, Worldwide Plaza, 450 Lexington Avenue, Bertelsmann Tower, and One World Trade Center; and internationally, the Embassy of the United States, Ottawa, and the Changi international terminal in Singapore.
            </p>
            <p>
             ..In September 2015, King Salman of Saudi Arabia rented every single room at the Four Seasons Hotel in order to accommodate his entourage while he met with President Barack Obama. The hotel added an extensive amount of gold gilded furniture and laid red carpet in every hallway in order to meet the royal party's tastes.[9] In that same month, Strategic Hotels &amp; Resorts sold itself to The Blackstone Group for $6 billion, giving the Four Seasons its first change in ownership.

            <blockquote>
             <p>
              Transhumanists believe that technologically “upgrading” humankind into a singularity will bring about a utopia in which “poor health, the ravages of old age and even death itself will all be things of the past.” In fact, eminent transhumanist Ray Kurzweil, chief of engineering at Google, believes that he will become “godlike” as a result of the singularity.
             </p>
             <p>
              But the truth is that transhumanism is merely a more high-tech revision of eugenics conceptualized by eugenicist and UNESCO Director-General Julian Huxley. And when corporate philanthropists like pedophile Epstein—as well as Bill Gates, Mark Zuckerberg, Peter Thiel, and Google executives such as Eric Schmidt and Larry Page—are the major bankrollers behind these transhumanism projects, the whole enterprise seems ominously reminiscent of the corporate-philanthropic funding of American and Nazi eugenics.
             </p>
             <blockquote>
              <p>
               But before these sex scandals were the highlight of Epstein’s celebrity, he was better known not just for his financial prowess, but also for his extensive funding of biotechnological and evolutionary science. With his bankster riches, he founded the Jeffrey Epstein VI Foundation which established Harvard University’s Program for Evolutionary Dynamics.
              </p>
              <p>
               Epstein, a former CFR and Trilateral Commission Member, also sat on the board of Harvard’s Mind, Brain, and Behavior Committee. He has furthermore been “actively involved in . . . the Theoretical Biology Initiative at the Institute for Advanced Study at Princeton, the Quantum Gravity Program at the University of Pennsylvania,” and the Santa Fe Institute, which “is a transdisciplinary research community that expands the boundaries of scientific understanding . . . to discover, comprehend, and communicate the common fundamental principles in complex physical, computational, biological, and social systems.”
              </p>
              <p>
               The scope of Epstein’s various science projects spans research into genetics, neuroscience, robotics, computer science, and artificial intelligence (AI). Altogether, the convergence of these science subfields comprises an interdisciplinary science known as “transhumanism”: the artificial “perfection” of human evolution through humankind’s merger with technology. In fact, Epstein partners with Humanity+, a major transhumanism interest group.

             <p>
              In this paper, I will argue that Kurzweil’s transhumanism contains a dimension of transgressive and millenarian spirituality that is best understood as an emerging form of contemporary esotericism.
             </p>
             <p>
              The second part of my argument is that transhumanism, as a movement, is currently merging with and mobilizing parts of the occulture. Transhumanist milieus appear to be converging with the technophilian, science-oriented wing of what used to be the “NewAge movement”, and with fashionable “Eastern” religious systems. Thus, transhumanism adds a new set of discursive elements to what Kennet Granholm calls the “discursive complexes” that make up contemporary esotericism.

              I have reported on Epstein's science funding/influencing in the past. He had his science meetings with top scientists on the big island, and then transported them to Little St. James for special R&amp;R......
             </p>
             <p>
              This is how the Globalists have taken over "science" research and keep the scientists in line.

              Epstein is absolutely a key figure. Who does he work for? Rothschilds?

            Excerpts:
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             A pesticide common in the 1800’s was called Paris Green. A green liquid because it was a combination of copper and arsenic or lead and arsenic. Some of the most toxic substances known to humankind. This super toxin was also used as a dye, in many items, including wall paper and paint. It was the sole focus of murder mystery novels at the time, as arsenic was known to be a very efficient way to stage a murder “for unknown reasons”, as arsenic kills but is hard to detect after the victim succumbs to the poison.
            </p>
            <p>
             This pesticide worked by causing neurological damage in the bugs, causing organ failure...Polio consists of symptoms synonymous with neurological damage, causing organ failure.
            </p>
            <p>
             Parents report finding their children paralyzed in and around apple orchards. One of the most heavily pesticide sprayed crops of the time (with lead arsenate or copper arsenate) were apple orchards.
            </p>
            <p>
             Dr. Ralph Scobey and Dr. Mortind Biskind testified in front of the U.S Congress in 1951 that the paralysis around the country known as polio was being caused by industrial poisons and that a virus theory was purposely fabricated by the chemical industry and the government to deflect litigation away from both parties.
            </p>
            <p>
             In 1956 the AMA (The American Medical Association) instructed each licensed medical doctor that they could no longer classify polio as polio, or their license to practice would be terminated. Any paralysis was now to be diagnosed as AFP (acute flaccid paralysis) MS, MD, Bell’s Palsy, cerebral palsy, ALS (Lou Gehrig’s Disease), Guillian-Barre, meningitis etc etc.
             <a href="http://bit">
              http://bit
             </a>
             . ly/1Ml3rpX This was orchestrated purposely to make the public believe polio was eradicated by the polio vaccine campaign but because the polio vaccine contained toxic ingredients directly linked to paralysis, polio cases (not identified as polio) were skyrocketing…but only in vaccinated areas.  Today most vaccine inserts declare paralysis as a potential side effect but “reframe it” as Guillian Barre or simply “paralysis”.
            </p>
            <p>
             <strong>
              The first polio vaccine was worked on by Dr. Jonas Salk and human experiments using this vaccine were conducted purposely on orphans in government/church run institutions because they were vulnerable and didn’t require any parental consent signatures, as they had no parents.
             </strong>
             The vaccine was “declared safe” by “medicine” (as they always are even though that vaccine was killing and paralyzing monkeys in test trials) and that vaccine gave 40,000 orphans polio, permanently paralyzed hundreds and killed at least 10 children. All injuries and deaths under reported of course by the same authorities who orchestrated the atrocity.
             <strong>
              This was called The Cutter Incident.
             </strong>
            </p>
            <p>
             The next “improved” polio vaccine, given to hundreds of millions, carried both the SV 40 cancer virus as well as the AIDS virus.  Every step of the way, medicine declaring they know for sure, that this time, they have everything straightened out. Same story then, same story now.... Cancerous tumors, still being pulled out of people today, are riddled with SV40 cancer viruses from the government’s “safe and effective” and “approved” polio vaccine.

              At the UN under Secretary General Antonio Guterres there has been entirely unaddressed bribery, including offers of weapons for oil by UN non governmental organization China Energy Fund Committee of Ye Jianming which Guterres refuses to even audit - while roughing up and banning the Press which asks him about it.
             </p>
             <p>
              On December 21 after Guterres and his spokesman had not answered a single one of Inner City Press' 35 written questions during the week and Guterres prepared to take off on another 11 day trip to Lisbon, still-banned Inner City Press reported and shows that Guterres has essentially killed off the UN's already weak public financial disclosure system. Guterres' own most recent online disclosure is from 2016, here, and it omits for example his listed role through 2018 in the Calouste Gulbenkian Foundation. Now this, which we report exclusively - the China Energy Fund Committee, implicated in the UN bribery conviction of Patrick Ho, has been linked to Guterres' Gulbenkian..

Bernhard’s guest list at the Bilderberg Group reflected his position in the oiligarchy; alongside him at the Swedish conference were David Rockefeller of the Standard Oil dynasty and his protege Henry Kissinger, Baron Edmond de Rothschild, E.G.

At its height, I.G. Farben was the largest chemical company in the world and the fourth largest industrial concern in the world, right behind Standard Oil of New Jersey.

              This poster appeared during the time when they thought a still undiscovered virus was causing the polio epidemics - a virus that must be spread by flies. Such adverts led to a greatly increased use of insecticides - which tragically were found by leading scientists working for US government agencies to cause precisely the same kind of paralytic damage to the spinal column nerves that were found in cases of polio. Their research simply was ignored...

             <p>
              Watson records the history of the development of pesticides and the pesticide industry explaining, for example, that many compounds used as early, non-selective pesticides, such as
              <strong>
               copper acetoarsenite, or Paris Green, a toxic dye
              </strong>
              , were by-products of industrial processes. Other substances used as pesticides included compounds of arsenic, mercury and sulphur as well as nicotine and hydrogen cyanide. Clearly such pesticides were as potentially lethal to those who used them as to the pests they were intended to destroy.
             </p>
             <p>
              ..It is interesting to note that some of the leading agro-chemical companies of the 20th century developed their expertise in pesticide chemistry as manufacturers of chemical warfare agents. Organophosphorus compounds, for example, act on the nervous system of mammals and insects inhibiting irreversibly the enzyme acetylcholinesterase. This causes the neurotransmitter acetylcholine to overload the nervous systems of affected organisms with constant transmission of signals between motor neurons, resulting in eventual death. The nerve agent Novchok, a topic of international news in 2018, is an organophosphate-based compound. Other examples include
              <strong>
               Tabun, based on insecticide development by the German chemical company, I.G. Farben in 1936, and VX, a nerve agent developed at Britain’s Porton Down defence laboratory in the 1950s and based on the organophosphate insecticide, Amiton.

It is a highly toxic emerald-green crystalline powder[3] that has been used as a rodenticide and insecticide,[4] and also as a pigment, despite its toxicity.
