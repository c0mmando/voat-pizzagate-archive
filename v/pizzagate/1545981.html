Here is a brief summary of why I and many people believe Justice Scalia was murdered. I don\'t really want to rewrite all of that for the sake of the more important discovery I made but, mods asked me to. I will if I have to.</p>
<p>I know this is probably common knowledge at this point so I will try and keep this brief and to the point of the discovery I made that I think is huge. </p>

This is the email where John Podesta &quot;receives&quot; the murder plot from a Joe Patterson. Notice that they ironically share the same initials. J.P. Joe links Podesta to his bio on <a href="https://www.facebook.com/viejojoe1/about?section=bio">facebook </a> where he can learn more information. If you look at his facebook, it appears it hasn\'t changed since 2011. Except the bio.</p>
<p>In the very first sentence in his bio we learn an interesting fact:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Born in the 1935 \'Dust Bowl\' of Oklahoma, Patterson served with the 7th Infantry Divison in Korea.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What an interesting factoid about the man. A true patriot. Glad to see he has moved on to directing movies.</p>
<p>Except there is one huge problem about saying you\'re a military man.....</p>

            I spent a lot of time following him around the internet. Here's what I came up with. Some of these links could lead to Pizzagate-type material; especially the venues he frequents and bands that play there.

            Jerry Rapp is a ghost writer who writes and produces in the horror genre. He is located in Kansas City, MO, but is active in red carpet events and film and music festivals; so it's not out of the question for him to move in the same circles as Alefantis and Podesta.
           </p>
           <p>
            I have archived the following links, and will replace with archived versions if anything happens to these. Because of the information that does not translate in the archiving, I'll post the direct links, for now. If anyone has time to dig further and download/archive anything they find, please help me follow these leads and add to what I've found so far.

            Note: The interviews divulge some information about his habits and favorite venues. A couple that I found interesting were
            <a href="https://www.facebook.com/Open-Fire-Wood-Burning-Pizza-524310417579268/">
             Open Fire Wood Burning Pizza
            </a>
            , which the restaurant is closed, but the venue in back
            <a href="https://www.facebook.com/ArtClosetStudios/?fref=ts">
             Art Closet Studios
            </a>
            is open. Based on the FB reviews and the entertainment posters, it gives me a questionable vibe. This might be a good place to dig.
           </p>
           <p>
            Another favorite place of his is
            <a href="http://kccrossroads.org/explore-the-crossroads/grinders-grinders-west/">
             Grinders
            </a>
            . Notice the various dark and devil references in their branding, as well as the use of eroticism and dripping pizza in their logo.

            I'm the one who made the recent submission tying Scalia's death with that of a Peace Corp worker...in that, they were both declared dead over the phone by the same Judge

           <p>
            Here's an interesting take from a news report after Scalia's death
            <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-nation/wp/2016/02/15/conspiracy-theories-swirl-around-the-death-of-antonin-scalia/">
             https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-nation/wp/2016/02/15/conspiracy-theories-swirl-around-the-death-of-antonin-scalia/
            </a>
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             Scalia’s physician, Brian Monahan, is a U.S. Navy rear admiral and the attending physician for the U.S. Congress and Supreme Court. He declined to comment on Scalia’s health when reached by telephone Monday at his home in Maryland.
            </p>
            <p>
             “Patient confidentiality forbids me to make any comment on the subject,” he said.
            </p>
            <p>
             When asked whether he planned to make public the statement he’s preparing for Guevara, Monahan repeated the same statement and hung up on a reporter.
            </p>
           </blockquote>
           <p>
            So who is this Monahan fellow? Well he was born in  Fairfield, CT (a known CIA town) and attended Georgetown (many key pizzagate players have ties to Georgetown)
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             Dr. Monahan was selected by the leadership of the Congress and nominated to the position and rank by United States President Barack Obama in January 2009
            </p>

             The Georgetown connection is key. Whoever sent this email sent it to Podesta's Georgetown email address. Many other suspicious emails sent to the Georgetowne email such as the one trying to sell beanie babies.

            The way I understand it now, the email about the film script seems to be calling for a major event in 2016 that will somehow lead to the end of the "wall" (i.e., the border) between the U.S and Mexico. This material doesn't make sense if it was really just about a film script, and, in any case, who would send a movie idea to a top-ranking politician like Podesta? The idea that the email is not really about a film script is strongly suggested by the bogus identity of the "Joe Patterson" who sent it. It would have been very easy for Podesta to figure out who this Joe Patterson was (if he didn't already know) by looking at his FB page. If it was a real movie proposal and Rapp was foolish enough to think Podesta would want to invest in it he would have had no reason to conceal his identity. So something is being discussed that is not the movie. What? Well, the clue is the map, where the line does indeed end at the location where Scalia was killed. There would be no need to send Podesta the link to the map if it was just a film proposal.

            Script email says it was also sent to pataki.  Democrats get one, republicans get the other....

           <p>
            Hillary was defacto nominee for democrats and who was the other?  Jeb! was. Baby brother dropped out February 20, right after debate where The Donald threatened to reveal W's knowledge of no WMD and implied inside jobs on other issues.
           </p>
           <p>
            Pataki had been a bush guy since 911 and made as much noise as he could (not much) about Trump's 911 accusations... Was likely in line for Jeb cabinet ?

            Jeb drops out same day as Scalia funeral.

            Because the family has most assuredly been made aware of the circumstances, anything they do would result in direct harm to their family physically and/or disgrace &amp; shame.  There is absolutely nothing positive that would come out any further investigation of this for the family, and they are fully aware of this.  Keeping silent is the best/only thing.

            Podesta makes a sick joke since this location is usually where they do FUN things in/around the pool at the ranch - “Didn’t think wet works meant pool parties at the Vineyard,” 
Steve Elmendorf replies.“I’m all in, Sounds like it will be a bad nite, we all need to buckle up and double down.”

            For the records this is a Oath of the Wild Boar Hunter copied from a traditional restaurant in Punta Ala peninsula in southern Tuscany  a posh resort and sailig port.
" In nome di Sant'Uberto con il sangue del tuo primo cinghiale
Io ti battezzo e ti nomino cacciatore di cinghiali.
Rispetta sempre questo animale e caccialo seguendo le tradizioni.
           </p>
           <p>
            Dannanzi all'animale abbattuto con il ginocchio sinitro a terra e la mano destra nella mano di chi da il battesimo,
il quale prende il sangue dal foro della palla con la mano sinistra e segna la fronte, il mento, il petto e la mano destra del battesimando."

            A map. Look where the line is pointing to on map (TX) specifically Shafter, TX where Scalia died.
           </p>
           <p>
            I found this email fascinating a while back, but chose to dismiss it only after believing it was a plot on Scalia. The only reason  I dismissed it was the guy's fb page had same "plot" on it and it was posted years before Scalia's death. I do believe they killed Scalia. Maybe this is correct. I hope so.

            I find much about the theory that the email sent to Podesta contained a proposal for a plan to kill Scalia plausible, but I would have thought that such things would be discussed entirely in person. Simple face to face communication would remove the necessity for such 'movie' proposals in the first place and leave nothing in writing.

             He's likely not the one calling the shots, yet the mouthpiece that send out the kill orders. Like it if came down from the very top, that person would both being on a fucking email that could eventually implicate themselves in such an op. Similar to the unit level of the military, the order comes from top brass, then to several other levels, to the CO, then the XO, then the ranking NCO and finally to the grunts or the men on the bottom.

In 1988, he and his brother Tony co-founded Podesta Associates, Inc., a Washington, D.C., "government relations and public affairs" lobbying firm.

            Thanks for the link lane 24:  So Christensen, is Kermit Christensen who married Margaret Isabelle Lucas (descendant of the Governor) They had 2 daughters (that I know of). Daughter Margaret Ellen Christensen married one John Warren Patterson (not our Joe Patterson apparently) in 1956, apparently in St. Louis, Mo. She was an artist. I don't have full access to Newspapers.com to see the full article, but I could see that much.
           </p>
           <p>
            So anyway....that couple had 2 children...looks like Bruce Frederick Patterson and Marcy Lucas Patterson. The other sister, Mary, doesn't appear to be married or have any children and like her late father Kermit,is a Dr.

            In order to understand this you have to go to the link first.  It's amazing discovery, again based in code.
Still more to be researched.

            I am really struggling with all this! I can see how the role of C. Allen Foster implicates Podesta in Scalia's murder, but I can't for the life of me see how the email in question contains a murder plot and I have absolutely no idea what the Lucas angle is about. Can someone please summarise this clearly and simply?

             Look at the imgur link I posted for information about murder plot, also remember the email Podesta sends right before Scalia is murdered about being all in. John Podesta to DC lobbyist Steve Elmendorf. Elmendorf was also the former chief of staff to Democratic leader Dick Gephardt.
            </p>
            <p>
             Podesta writes, “Didn’t think wet works meant pool parties at the Vineyard.”
            </p>
            <p>
             Elmendrof responds, “I am all in Sounds like it will be a bad nite , we all need to buckle up and double down”
            </p>
            <p>
             In the wikileaks email I link in my post, the "sender" (most likely not this Joe Patterson character) identifies them self as a D.A.R verified descendant over Robert Lucas. This is how we would find out who the sender actually is.

              Can you actually give me the imgur link instead of just referring to it? I have no time to read through every post you've ever written looking for it. But do I have to read it anyway? Why can't you just tell me why you think the movie idea is actually a murder plot? It would make the whole thing a lot easier to comprehend!

                  The threads are long and involved, especially the first one (why was a second thread needed at all, I wonder?), which is doubly difficult because most participants are already 'in the picture' and do not bother to make it clear what they are talking about. Because Voat does not display the threads in a manner that makes them easy to navigate, following longer threads is extremely taxing. Anyway I looked at the imgur and understand it better now. What I'm still not sure about is how the movie project points to the exact location where Scalia was killed. I now have to find the email to check through it.

            In the email/script...the guy (patterson) says he has a guy lined up named Ken Del Conte who is excellent with small budget movies. The budget on this was listed at 1.5 which would be very small in movie standards. Anyway, Ken Del Conte is a real guy who in fact directs small films...I think this is a big "check mark" in the column that says this may just be a really shitty little script and not a coded assassination.

             or 1.5 is the cost to preform a hit of this magnitude. Perhaps ken is the conduit that facilitated the action or was the trigger man himself.

              Perhaps a conduit...definitely not a hitman. My main point is that Ken Del Conte is a relatively well known director/producer in Hollywood...not the type of guy you use for a hit...they have sheep dipped ppl for that kinda stuff. What WOULD be interesting would be to get in touch with Ken Del Conte and ask if he's ever been approached about a project called Inez comes to America...if he says yes...then this is probably legit...if he has no idea what your talking about then maybe this is a code and they just threw in a real guy to make it look legit.

             But why would he send his shitty script to John Podesta and a former governor and big time lawyer? Why list the benefits of combining Mexico and USA in the email? Why does he list a different email to contact him on other than the one he sent it from?

              I'll attempt to answer that piece by piece (my best guesses really)
why would he send his shitty script to John Podesta and a former governor and big time lawyer?   -Because he's desperate and thinks his shitty move could help their political cause by supporting an open boarder society (Hillary and Podesta want open boarders...typical NWO stuff)...Like Hey -I have a movie you could get behind, make money and support your NWO ideology!" (thats why he lists the benefits of merger) Also, these ppl have money and will invest in stuff. For example, Tony Podesta gives money to "artists" and galleries all the time....so this line of fund raising isn't that abnormal. The lawyer is on there because he would eventually need to be involved anyway for contract/legal review IF Podesta decided he wanted to give $$.   no clue on email

            So this Patterson guy was born in 35' and died in the Korean War in 50'??  How many 15yr olds did we have fighting over there?  No wonder it was a stale-mate... In all seriousness though that can't be accurate.

            Why: He was an impediment to Clinton... did you SEE all the supposed "GOP" shills lining up at the trough to praise Hillary? Ex Presidents (2, perhaps 3, not counting her husband and Barry), Generals, Governors... hell, Hillary WAS the GOP Candidate in 2016.
           </p>
           <p>
            And "paedo": The Clintons both LOVE to blame others for crimes they themselves commit. It's a strategy, places your enemy off balance and makes them look like they're just parroting you ("you" being the guilty party). Most people in high places have been compromised directly, or by association. Scalia? He may have been there to hunt people (St. Hibernius Club, rumored). Or perhaps to dine on "long pig" (Soylent Green), or perhaps to engage in "forbidden fruit". We don't know exactly, but the speculation so far has led toward paedo - perhaps wrongly, yet Scalia did grow up in an admittedly fascist household with his father, Nazi sympathizer, so I don't suppose that Scalia himself might have been abused is too far fetched for Nazi leanings toward "discipline".
           </p>
           <p>
            In any case, we don't know yet. We DO know he was there, cryptic (and not so cryptic) communications with Podesta PREDATE his presence there by months/days with ODD coincidentality, and we know he died - quite unexpectedly, and that the aftermath of that death was most suspicious. That's about all we know for sure, but these emails and sender/recipients fit the bill, almost like OJ's glove... only much better.

I have the script, similar in theme to “Fahrenheit 911”, which grossed 119M. There is one version for Republicans and one for Democrats. The buyer gets both.

             Armed with the script and the funding, we go to Europe as writer/producers and split what ever comes; 50/50.

            I've been scouring 2009 and 2010 for events (in another post), I didn't find anything that jumped out until I reread the message again before I was going to bed for the night.  "I have the script, similar in theme to "Fahrenheit 911", it jumped out at me, this is code, the code "terrorist attack".
           </p>
           <p>
            I look up terrorist attacks and see this:

            This is the underwear bomber that flew from Amsterdam (95% Europe) to Detroit that was supposed to blow up mid flight. I missed this before because I was looking for successful events not failed ones.

            I'm assuming one version is success and one is failure?  Or one is over US and other is over Europe?

            The film did domestically make this, but is it code for anything?  Wiki says bomber was in seat 19a, 119 is 911 reversed, and it says it would be the deadliest bombing surpassing American 191 on US soil.

            3 months lead time between these "pseudonymous" emails and the "wetworks" email. That's adequate time to get a wetworks team and plan together, especially at this level... heck, they took a little longer with Kennedy, but that was a PUBLIC execution...

            On the descendant of Robert Lucas, I found some things that should be useful for anyone working out who that might be. Here is some research done by someone who was looking into this family. Apparently Robert Lucas' sons George and Napoleon were twins and were illegitimate. They don't come up on ancestry.com as Robert Lucas' children, but clearly they were as documented elsewhere. Here's the research by that person, showing who each of those children married and their children and children's spouses:
            <a href="http://news.rootsweb.com/th/read/LUCAS/1997-01/0853713458">
             http://news.rootsweb.com/th/read/LUCAS/1997-01/0853713458

             https://archive.is/q0QZP
            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            And then also I found proceedings of the Masonic Grand Lodge of San Francisco in 1897 - a William Thomas Lucas was Grand Master and there was also a Frederick William Lucas. I haven't connected them to governor robert lucas, but there's a lot of them around and procreating in the 19th century, so there could be a connection, and obviously the freemason thing makes it interesting given the subject matter.

              ON EDIT:  Other than the two Robt. Lucas sons who were illegitimate -- George and Napoleon --
there may be some other parts of the trail that are misleading.  Seems there is disagreement with genealogists about her paternal grandmother reported by Hillary as Hannah Jones Rodham (Welsh) versus genealogists' claim that her paternal grandmother was Mary Bynum Jarnagin (Tennessee-Colonial ancestry)
             </p>
             <p>
              Also may be further room for confusion as Huffington Post article below suggests that genealogists got one-quarter of HRC's family tree wrong:
             </p>
             <blockquote>
              <p>
               One of Rodham Clinton’s grandmothers was a woman named Hannah Jones who was born in Scranton, Pennsylvania around 1882. If you’ve been doing genealogy for even a short time, you know to be cautious whenever you encounter a name like Jones, which happens to be the most common surname in Wales, the birth place of Hannah’s parents. Names like Jones, Smith, Johnson, Brown, Miller and Williams are a punch-line in the family history world — guaranteed to provoke a reaction from a seasoned audience — because we all know how much effort it can take to sift through the abundance of records featuring these names to find the ones we’re looking for.

               So it’s astonishing that no one had taken the time to make sure that they had identified the correct Hannah Jones. As it happens, there were two baby girls born with this name in Scranton around the same time, and the other one left a more conspicuous paper trail. It’s not surprising that some researchers fell into the trap of picking the wrong one, but it’s mind-blowing that everyone did.

               If everyone got a quarter of Hillary Clinton’s tree wrong, what about yours? Are the names adorning your family tree really your ancestors or just crowd-sourced fiction?

            </a>
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             When Scalia arrived in Houston and chartered a plane after ditching his US Marshall protection detail, Scalia and his companion, C. Allen Foster. Foster heads the Order of Hubertus and is co-owner with John Poindexter of the Cibolo Creek Ranch, 25,000 plus acres free for anyone to use, according to John Poindexter, “free of charge,” so long as they are a supreme court justice, “A list” celebrity like Mick Jagger or billionaires, others need not apply.
            </p>
            <p>
             The crux of the story is how they got Scalia. According to sources, Scalia had been providing protection for an international pedophile ring and was murdered by “friends” who he had informed of the nature of his visit with Obama and the doom it signaled for those around Scalia, prosecution, ruin and Citizens United reversed.
            </p>
            <p>
             The mechanism Scalia used to provide this protection was the Federalist Society which chooses the judges throughout the US judiciary system so should any unfortunate pedophile find himself in court, the judge was under Scalia’s control, thus making a successful prosecution difficult to achieve.
            </p>
            <p>
             The Federalist Society grooms and recruits candidates to become judges at a young age – college age kids; they specifically seek out suitable candidates who have certain moral ambiguities that can be exploited.
            </p>
            <p>
             Thus a stranglehold is placed on the judicial system of the United States by a group which serves the interests of big business – corrupt corporations, big pharma, the oil and coal barons; this is how their interests are, time and again, placed ahead of those of we, the people with the result that our environment and our bodies are polluted by the products of these corporations, be it poisons like aspartame and GMO crops in our food, toxins in our ground water (see Flint, MI) or just plain old exploitation of poor people such as the coal miners of West Virginia and Kentucky.
            </p>
            <p>
             Scalia met with the Order of Saint Hubertus, the patron saint of million dollar dude ranch hunting. As of yet, no one has identified who was there, it seems that Supreme Court justices are found all the time with pillows over their faces and nobody asks a thing, but this was Texas and they make their own rules down there.
            </p>
            <p>
             We remember former FBI director and founder, J Edgar Hoover, the man who said ritual satanic child abuse was a conspiracy theory. He is also the man who said the mafia didn’t exist. 
Scalia’s talk in Texas was said to have gone like this: “They have us, we are all going down unless we can give them what they want and they are holding all the cards, they have everything.” There was no negotiation with the White House, instead Scalia got, we are told and multiple sources confirm, a pillow over the face and a heroic funeral, one that President Obama refused to attend. Now we know why.

            Please explain one thing. If the script is fake then why we have a post of Joe Petterson talking about the script way back in 2010/2011? I call it bullshit, not about Scalia at all.

             Joe uses "scripts" as a cover... there ARE no "scripts", most likely, however THESE particular scripts aren't even written in proper screenplay format - and he mentions this, and excuses it. Likely just more backstory, making the whole thing easier to email around. I must admit, the "Democrat or GOP" versions things is most peculiar - people in Hollywood really ARE this crass, but they're even more professional about their crassness. There is a certain false naiveté here that doesn't seem to fit with "seasoned producer", if you ask me, though there is definite knowledge of how this process works, and certain elements of it - for instance, the email writer mentions "WGA number", which is a script registration number showing a date proof of authorship, in case there is ever a dispute.
            </p>
            <p>
             That's most likely a ruse, because the script sample sent is SO BAD - the writing - that well, you can see why this person isn't writing blockbusters, but why would anyone spend $1.5 mil for THIS - a script where the dialog lays like lead pipe on frozen ground? It's bad. Stiff. Definitely "filler", something a student might turn in - it's for show.

              It doesn't make any sense. Maybe he is just a poor writer trying to find some producer for his film he's working on since 2010/11. Not about Scalia at all.

             He's talking about AMNESTY - near complete. And painting a rosy picture of outsourcing to Mexico, even as the US brings in Mexican professionals to UNDERCUT US workers, thereby forcing down wages and busting unions, AGAIN. TO A DEMOCRAT. Which only proves that the DNC has completely ABANDONED working people and will never return, now having had a taste of the "real money".

             You don't have to give Texas back to the Mexicans... all you need is complete AMNESTY, and it'll be Montezuma's revenge on everyone but the top 3%... Social Darwinism.

             The family didn't get to choose the autopsy because the Judge declared it not needed. I don't believe the family got a say in his cremation or not. There was also some child care worker just discovered on here connected with this same judge where it was suspected murder, no autopsy and cremation again.

            Someone on this forum explained to me in a comment more than a month ago that Scalia was killed by his own. I'm trying to find the thread and the comment but can't remember who it was, or what the thread was about. It was in early December or November.
The gist was that Scalia was called by the Whitehouse and shown an incriminating dossier by Obama who wanted to blackmail him for a vital court decision, Scalia took the file to the ranch that day (or next day), showed the cronies the file, and that night they slit his throat because the dirt would take all of them down. They didn't need Scalia because the case went to the S. Court, split 4-4 and remanded back to lower court with same verdict. I'm trying to remember the case. 
Anyway, that was this voater's take on Scalia's murder, if anyone has whitehouse visitor logs, maybe this would comfirm a Scalia visit to support this theory.

             that's the story, but we cannot CONFIRM that story - we have no available means to do so. For all we know, Obama asked him if he'd support a Clinton candidacy, or at least not object. No way of telling, without someone spilling their guts or documentation.

              One case was The United States V Texas. The order would allow the offspring of illegal immigrants to work legally, roughly 4 million people. Maybe that's the Mexican connection in the movie plot and Scalia was killed because he would have opposed this.

            I'm also seeing from the Reddit Thread on the donald about this, it says the lawyer that seems to be friends with Podesta that took Scalia to the ranch is tied to Bohemian Grove, didn't we find a bunch of info on them lately?

            I'm tottally on board with this and cant believe I didn't read this stuff earlier...but one thing I don't understand, can someone explain how or what Scalia would do that would be necessary to remove him?  What I mean is, I know the constitution and law somewhat well, but I don't know why you would remove a USSCJ as necessary to annex Mexico?

                No I get that part, just not understanding how once they have supreme court that will allow them to annex the US.  The only thing the court would matter for in this NAU (which they even made currency for once) is repeal of the 2nd amendment so they can do whatever they want.  I'm just not understanding what Scalia would have impeded them on for annexation of Mexico as that would have been able to occur with him around.  Either there is something we are missing as to what his impediment would have been or they wanted him gone for another reason?

             Pizzagate is not just child sex crimes. It is a network of powerful people engaging in guns, drugs, children, murder, etc. This will lead us to another player in the ring.

            DAR documented doesn't mean it is a female, to join DAR you have to prove with authentic sources your relationship by blood to a revolutionary fighter. Simply means they have the authenticated documents to prove the relation.

            Does anyone have a method of archiving that is a little easier to read than blowing up those crammed 4 chan images?  The topics always seem really solid with data, I feel like I am looking at this

             The key is to look at the ID number up top (highlighted on the image) to understand who is who. Then understand that "&gt;&gt;123456789 #" means "replying to ID123456789" and whatever question they asked.
            </p>
            <p>
             So read the top corner left, and then follow the relevant green lines outward. The original threads are far more nightmarish to follow. This is the easy version!

            Does anyone know if there's a place to look up names of everyone from the 7th Infantry Division? This book titled

            Joe Patterson has only one friend on FB and that is Jerry Rapp. As Rapp is a writer/director, I'd say Rapp made the Patterson FB account up and, for some reason, used this bogus identity to try to get  Podesta's support for his nutty film project.

              This people employ steganography tactics to hide images inside images for pedophilia. Why would they not employ it in real life? A plot inside a movie plot. Also....why do you only post concern trolling comments?

               S/he is RPing a troll.  It's a good enough gig, for the reasonably thick of skin.  :-)

               Anyway, who cares?  It's not like PG would be better off with less critical thinking and devil's advocacy.  There's lots of bullshit left to shovel out, and always more being dumped in by our (ahem) friends on the radar screen.

                  True, and even though none of this is funny, it is kind of funny imagining them watching here, seeing something else discovered and then tripping over their own feet to try to hide the evidence. Like a scrambling bunch of cowardly  weasels.

              It's an odd place to not bring protection simply bc, even though it's in the middle of nowhere, it's close to the border and those ranches are known to have coyotes running through w drug runners all the time. On the other hand, I could see someone like Scalia telling those guys to enjoy a weekend off bc he felt he was safe.

             If Scalia was murdered as it very well appears to have happened, the real person who sent this email of the plot identified themselves as being a "D.A.R. documented descendant of Ohio Governor Robert Lucas". Hillary Clinton is associated with this group. Whoever is connected to Robert Lucas can be implicated in this plot to kill Scalia.

             <p>
              And you are claiming who ever is a descendent of a guy who had 8 children and died in the 1850's got together to kill Antonin Scalia?  That would be hundreds of people.  Scalia did not die on Martha's Vineyard.  He died on a ranch.  A ranch that does not make wine.

                There's no evidence of that.   There are pictures that people label as a vineyard, but nothing predating the emails being released.

                Let me be clear.  It's claimed Cibolo Creek Ranch has a large vineyard, but all of those claims come after the wikileaks.  Zero evdience past years.

               This is not nonsense. I am not claiming "who ever is a descendent of a guy who had 8 children and died in the 1850's got together to kill Antonin Scalia" THEY STATED THAT in the email. How do you know it would be hundreds of people? Some of his kids didn't have kids, and most people live 50-80 years then. that would mean three generations tops. Yeah really reassuring that his movie script posted in 2012 involves "murder, cover-up and political corruption"
              </p>
              <p>
               And mind you, in the fucking email, the plot references "The search leads them to an isolated ranch house with a massive  underground tunnel" The Cibolo Creek Ranch is in the middle of ghosttown Shafter TX, population 11.

                A generation is not 50 or 80 years.  A generation is when you have children.   In genealogy, this is considered 25 years on average.  But it very realistically could be shorter and most likely was in previous centuries
               </p>
               <p>
                So if you are 80 years you could easily have three generations of descendants
               </p>
               <p>
                great grandfather 80 years &gt;  grandmother 60 years &gt; father 40 years &gt; daughter 20 years.
If that daughter gave birth to a new born, you would have a total of 5 living generations.
               </p>
               <p>
                Lucas was born in 1781 that's 235 years ago or at least 8 full generations from the time of his first child.
                <a href="http://familyrecordfinder.com/descendants.html">
                 Using a common formula for descendants,
                </a>
                if each generation averaged 3 children per family as opposed to the 7 Lucas had, that would mean about 10,000 descendants over the years with hundreds still alive.   If the families average 4 children over the years, it would like 90,000 total descendants.

                "They" didn't state anything.  One guy did.  Are you just confusing the singular and plural pronnounds.  Do you really think he was speaking on behalf on any descendant of Robert Lucas or on behalf of the whole Daughters of the American Revoluation?  It's nonsense, there is no THEY here.

            If he was truly born in 1935 how would he fight in the Korean war that was from 1950-1953? Unless maybe he joined right at the end? I guess the point I should make is that the person who sent this email is not that person. We need to find out who the direct decedents of Robert Lucas are.

             <pre><code>Writer-producer with political connections needed. I have the script, similar in theme to “Fahrenheit 911”, which grossed 119M. There is one version for Republicans and one for Democrats. The buyer gets both.

The goal is to help swing votes for one of these contenders in 2010.

95% takes place in Europe where I have a producer who has prepared the budget. We need funding from one of the Political Action Committees.

Armed with the script and the funding, we go to Europe as writer/producers and split what ever comes; 50/50.

              I've been scouring 2009 and 2010 for events (in another post), I didn't find anything that jumped out until I reread the message again before I was going to bed for the night. "I have the script, similar in theme to "Fahrenheit 911", it jumped out at me, this is code, the code "terrorist attack".
             </p>
             <p>
              I look up terrorist attacks and see this:

              This is the underwear bomber that flew from Amsterdam (95% Europe) to Detroit that was supposed to blow up mid flight. I missed this before because I was looking for successful events not failed ones.

              I'm assuming one version is success and one is failure? Or one is over US and other is over Europe?

             <p>
              The film did domestically make this, but is it code for anything? Wiki says bomber was in seat 19a, 119 is 911 reversed, and it says it would be the deadliest bombing surpassing American 191 on US soil.

            <s>
             With names like "Joe" and "Patterson", it's not unreasonable for your average Joe to have the same last name in an military division in the war. You'd be surprised. With all of the wars, eventually, there will be some coincidental anomalies. Vsauce did that video about coincidences, where 1 photo captured 2 kids, who didn't know each other [i.e.: 1 kid in the background], and then later in life went on to meet and get married.

             I appreciate your skepticism, and try to use that myself as much as possible, but let me 1-up you on the stats game lol
            </p>
            <p>
             If you're in a room with 20 people, the odds are high that
             <em>
              any two people
             </em>
             have the same birthday. But, the odds are low that someone will share
             <em>
              your
             </em>
             birthday.
            </p>
            <p>
             So, if we're looking at any common names for any army division, it's likely that there are going to be two people that share the same name. But, if it's one particular person that we've already singled out through their connection to podesta, then the chance is small that another person in their division that shares their same name.

              The most common form of "Identity theft" as being when an entire identity is assumed (and not just a temporary straw man or patsy), is to utilize the identity of someone DECEASED. It requires experienced skip tracers and PI's to decipher what, if any, information is being relayed by the choice, though it is most often just "random" and based on available information or dates, etc.
             </p>
             <p>
              In this instance, I think we can assume certain information is being relayed, if we can demonstrate a CHAIN of such information relative to the purpose of the identity (coded information, in a format such that only the recipient could be certain what is being discussed) - which is already being firmly established..

              Ah, that makes mores sense. People have explained it before, and it was on reddit also. However, I don't think that I've heard it in terms of 1 person being singled out.

             The real point I should make is that the real person behind this email is not this Joe Patterson we see. We need to find who the direct decedents of Ohio Governor Robert Lucas are. That's how they identify themselves in this email.

                 Just found it odd that people say that the Owl is the symbol they use for Moloch and Minerva is Athena, who is symbolized by an owl.  And he lived at a place called Plum Grove (like Bohemian Grove?), in Iowa City, which I've been to many times and don't think I've ever heard of it.

               The telling piece of evidence to me was that his next of kin family reportedly passed on the opportunity for a post-mortem autopsy. Fairly certain they knew he was an ultimate, violent pedo and just decided that would make more waves and create more heat. Kinda accomplished that anyways by forgoing a critical facet to any COD investigation.

               The caretaker at the ranch said he found him with a pillow over his head, then retracted the claim. The Judge who ruled autopsy unneeded in his case also said he died of a heart attack, then retracted the claim.

                So they retract and that means it never occurred?  How strange. Hmmm. I wonder how many children were brought there for their amusement. He had eight of his own. I wonder if he abused them to create more of his ilk. These are pretty sick people.

             The odds are astronomical that it's a coincidence. If it were you or me and we sent such an email re someone who is our ideological enemy under similar circumstances, we would've been picked up so fast our heads would spin. But then we don't have dirt on pretty much everybody who runs everything. In this country, sooo.

             Yeah, this isn't rocket science.  Things like a SCOTUS dying are extremely rare, and there just happens to be an email using the term wetworks 3 days before?

             I've heard all the snopes/dem explanations for using "wetworks" to describe Hillary's New Hampshire loss in the primary..... That doesn't pass the smell test.  Wetworks is a niche word, and one that would not be used for a primary loss, in my opinion.

                 It's also used when you lay people off, like a human resource manager saying he going to do a hit.  It's a reference to the CIA terms, but not an actual murder.
A lot of people think this corresponds to a hit on Bernie.
In Paticular this one from the same date as the email.

                The second is obviously meant as the same thing and used as a figure of speech, a humorous hyperbole. The first is irrelevant in the context.

              What kind of hunting did they do on this ranch. Something more nefarious than pheasant?  I read a report on here that it was thought that BO summoned Scalia to the WH and handed him an envelope with proof of something that the Hibertus Soc. would most certainly not want revealed. You can't make this stuff up.

                I am of the belief that BO called him to the WH to present the dirt he had on him in order to blackmail.  St. Hubertus offed him.  He had become a liability.

                  Maybe it was something we will never know about.  They were all involved in so many nefarious things.  Somehow I bet Assange knows.  Podesta has a lot of power.  When they released her cabinet choices he was listed as Secretary of State.  What a catastrophe.  She is like a vampire never dying and she will not be happy until she sucks the blood out of all of us.   She will run for Pres. again.  We must kill the Democratic Party and drive a stake into it's heart before they run her again.

                 the article I read was akward.  it was not clear who had the file obumer or scalia.   if obumer had the file and gave the file to scalia and he took it
to the ranch, showed his cohorts he could not protect them anymore ??? a global trafficking ring.   he would go down via the law 
or
                </p>
                <p>
                 scalia was Not for open borders and NWO.  He and killary did not like each other.   strong conservative jusge.   there was a murder plot and coverup.  was he supporting the TPP or not.   is that the case he was working on ???? obumer enjo yed summoning him.   obumer didn't like him he was not a liberal etc.  so why not just kill him for blocking him and killary?
I don't get it     the emails do suggest he was going to be killed.

                  Well,  it probably contained pedophilia charges and who knows what else.  Possibly hunting the children as well.  It has been written on here that there are such charges regarding the elites and many royals.  The International Order of Hubertus was probably very worried that findings could be discussed with others and they could not allow that.  He also may have told BO that he was not going to vote his wishes.  We will never really know.  But I have read before, a few years ago that he had pedophile tendencies.  JP had Scalia taken care of by orders of BO.  Whatever the reason or how it happened we know what that email was about.  Wet Works.

                  <p>

                    They are all violent pedos.  Even if they have not killed a child themselves, they are complicit just knowing it is occurring.  Yes. Well with the email and Wikileaks releasing it, we know it was pretty important.  And nefarious.Wet works.  Maybe JP belonged to Hubertus as well.  We don't know. To think I voted for BO twice and GWB and WJC.  What a bunch of worthless pieces of crap.  All the people that died under their hands.  Wars.  Our kids and those of other countries.  None of their kids have died. The D-Evil Cabal.

               The hunting on the ranch thing is scarily reminiscent of the claims of "people hunting" in these elite groups.

                That is what I am afraid of. It  brings to mind the accounts of Fiona Barnett. I read her story over and over so I will never forget. They must all die or be locked up forever. I want them to suffer for the heinous crimes they have perpetrated upon the helpless. I have no remorse for any of them.

                 Yep exactly where my mind went. Her account of the "hunting parties" was one of the more impressionable stories I've heard and far beyond evil if true.

                  I believe that the Court of Brussels is taking up the case. I also believe that is why they have the former pope behind locked gates. He is mentioned in her account. I remember how he loved his handmade Red Prada Shoes. I wonder if Tony Podesta's Red Shoes were also made by Prada.

            Is there somewhere that explains the analogy in that "murder plot"?  It's kind of long, and doesn't mention Scalia by name.

            Excellent submission, competently researched, reasoned, and explained. I'm flairing it as
            <em>
             New Evidence
            </em>
            (technically, it's "old" evidence newly summarized, but I feel that the distinctive flair is justified as this is actual circumstantial evidence).

             Keep repeating this and he might realize that there's a real chance it will happen, and he might turn states witness! Cuz the noise isn't stopping, all the paid shills aren't working. The dots are still being connected and evidence dug up.... seriously. He's got what two weeks before shit could get REAL nasty! And if I was a Saudi Puppet master I'd be lining up some wetworks on a little pizza boy, no matter how much moolah he cleans through art!! THINK ABOUT IT JAMES!! I'd pull a Braverman and call the FBI like NOW!!!

              I want to believe... About it all; that Braverman knew he was outed as the source, and skipped on over to the feds for protection. That Alefantis is smart enough to know that time is running out on him, (he's certainly familiar with the conversations going on over here and know's the ship has just about run it's course, largely due in part to our investigative efforts). Or that if he doesn't give himself up and cut a deal, essentially walking towards the light, he does meet his maker for everything he's done.
             </p>
             <p>
              My obvious concern is shared by you. That if his evil overloads go through with it, it will be an excellent opportunity to do what they always do... Spin it for their agenda and to further win over popular public opinion.
             </p>
             <p>
              The scenario you've mentioned is super dicey either way.

                  That has nothing to do with it. The point is, they were installed. If they were installed, they certainly aren't in control of those doing the installing.

                 This makes sense when you pair it with William Daniel's discovery that Netanyahu is half Muslim. (When his brother was killed in Uganda he received a Muslim burial. There's a good video on this somewhere)

                  Things can get really fun here. Because of what Islam is based on. Mohammed met up with a bunch of heretic Jewish Christians that were living in his area. And many of his beliefs are based on theirs.

                  It's remarkably similar to Arianism (the theology of Arius, not White Power Aryanism)
