            Rinse and repeat the meaningless bullshit while you sheep wait for the Masons, Jeuits and sellouts to arrest themselves. I hear Rothschild is scarred to death of your victories. Mass arrest around the corner and trials in our legit courts.

            Hey y'all.  Just as a cautionary word.  Would she says she's running for President in 2020 in order to give her some protection against malicious prosecution from conspiracy theories that just want to see Trump carry on being President?  (please note.. Im saying that as if she were saying it..  Its all optics and theatre.

            She supposedly is re branding herself.  The sheep will still follow.  We shall see.  Many more are Woke than the last time, but MSM will bow before her.  They will keep spreading her lies.  This news I believe is coming from Mark Penn.  Lowlife.  Is he hoping for a job?  I hope that's all it is.  He is full of hot air so we shall see.

              I keep reminding people, but they still think there is a difference.  After all that happened in the 2016 election they are still bamboozled. They are laughing while they are running around in their kitty hats protesting on cue.

             I think that even people who fully supported her were disgusted by the terrible way she handled her loss, so she lost a lot of support there. Even amongst the people who still love her, I think most everyone on her side has come to terms with the fact that she simply won't ever win an election unless the electoral collage is changed. Even if they still believe the reason that the people in the middle of the country didn't vote for her because they are racist homophobes, they have realized that shaming them with name calling won't get them to change their votes.
            </p>
            <p>
             I agree with septimasexta above. She is scared by the new attorney general and is trying to prevent a new investigation into her dubious dealings by claiming Trump is merely trying to smear his political opponent.

              Are you around people that hate Trump?  I am. They not only hated him when they voted for her they hate him even more now.  They hate him so much that they will vote for anyone but him.  I also know some that hated her so much they voted for him.  But the hate for him has strengthened among Dems.  I don't agree with many of them, but I am being honest to let people know that it's not just about her not being  electable, it's about hating the other side.  Hating the one that took it away from her.  That's just how the other side thinks.  And believe me they will Re-Brand her to look way younger and sound way younger and she will have all those Parkland Activists marching with her Lock Step.  I hope to God I am wrong, but the Clintons have been at this for a long time.  She will have the Rainbow Banner wrapped around her and she will be surrounded by Trannys and the LGBTQ Crowd.  And she will have Bill her Snake Charmer husband as well playing his Sax.  If the poll they run looks bad, they will bring in Oprah.  What's not to love?  Yuck.

               I'm not arguing that there isn't a big block of people who will vote for her if she runs. And yes, that block of people is ANGRY! What I am saying is that by now, most of those people have come to terms with the fact that she simply can't win an election, even if they lie to themselves about why it is she can't win. I agree that we are on the verge of civil war because of the vitriol on both sides, and as deathtomasonsasap said below, fostering this vitriol is how they keep the sheeple in line.

                Yeah stoking the anger is their mo.   I think many of them are out to lunch when it comes to reality.  I do say and know that many have been woken up and hopefully that will have an effect.  I can't endure another Hillary election.  I just can't..

            It's the Thing That Wouldn't Die. What a nightmare, if true. I do not see this as a positive as some of you do. It means her gigantic political machine, full off thugs and crooks in high places, is still alive and well and has access to power. She came very close to winning and many still wish she had and would wish that again. Ugh.

             It was a nothing exchange by two Twitter accounts. She can't help that the CoS account was tagged or replied. She is a child-trafficking murderer imo but the Twitter thing doesn't prove anything and is probably a waste of time. My 2cents

               Speaking at a press conference in Moscow earlier this week, ex-Georgian State Security Minister Igor Giorgadze said he had received reports about deaths that could have resulted from vaccine tests at a US-funded lab in Georgia.

               Igor Giorgadze, a former Georgian state security minister, has claimed that the US-funded medical facility, known as the Richard G. Lugar Center for Public Health Research, in Georgia could be a cover for a bioweapons laboratory.

               Diplomatic shipping was under Hillary's control when she was Secretary of State. 
It has been discussed here many times under the Clinton supported Art in Embassies program. It was pointed out that many JA Transformer art events brought in Embassy art. THEY CAN SHIP ANYTHING, including biological material, without being inspected at customs. Many theorized containers could be used for child trafficking. Evidently, they can ship BLOOD as well.

               I think Trump had to get Kavanaugh in place before proceeding with indictments. Hillary was safe until he got appointed and other things happened. Now she is not.

                Not understanding whar Kavanaugh has to do with anything. He's a supreme court justice, not an attorney general. He IS rid of that worthless Sessions, finally, so there's that.

                 Supposedly he would consider military tribunals for non-military citizens Constitutional for acts of treason. They are going after FISA and Uranium 1 deal. Kinda like  IRS tax evasion..... New attorney general will DECLAS pertinent docs Clinton Cabal had been blocking.
