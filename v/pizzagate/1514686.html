            If you know a little about secret societies it is not a warning , more like hiding it in plain sight. Because they believe as long as they show you and you don't act on it, they don't have to worry about Karma.
All day today I was searching for something I had seen. I was always puzzled by the strange celebrity break downs from Britney to Lindsay etc. And I am not sure if it was a Tila Tequila tweet or a B.O.B tweet but one of them had tweeted, that everything in the movie Hostel was real. If you haven't seen I would not recommend that you see, just the trailer is enough go see just how SICK it is. Someone had poste about Marquis de Sade and that reminddd of it and it really is the most terrifying thought.

             i'm familiar with their approach but it doesn't fit easily with these pieces. the japanese director clearly waged war against the masonists, may god protect his life. the american on the other hand seem to think that he can cure the eliet from their pedophilia "disorder" the french one is the one who might fit your discription, since he removed the moral stand on the issue. 
i did watch "hostel" and maybe a little of hostel 2, and yes it does feel real, but they don't make it like a secret society, but more of rich saditic people who finance a business.
