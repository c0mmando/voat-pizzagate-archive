<p>The US contractor, DynCorp, has been operating in Haiti for over two decades winning their first government contract to supply U.N. peacekeepers in 1994.</p>
<p>In light of George Webb’s ongoing investigation of the Clinton Foundation (see bottom of page for link) and it’s associate network, I thought now would be a good opportunity to dig deeper into DynCorp’s involvement in Haiti’s police forces.</p>
<h2>“Concentrate on where DynCorp trains police because that’s where the sex slave trade is going to be” – Webb (Day 83, pt.1)</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_E4tW1fq-k">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_E4tW1fq-k</a></p>
<p>To probably no one’s great surprise, Haiti is one of the countries where DynCorp has contracts from the USG to not only train and support the Haitian National Police force (HNP) but also DynCorp is a key player in providing international officers to serve in the U.N. Stabilization Mission in Haiti (MINUSTAH). In addition, DynCorp affiliates provide corrections advisors for training and support of prison workers. </p>
<p>Partners such as Professional Business Solutions Inc. (PBSI) also contribute to HNP corrections training with the aim to “transform and professionalize the HNP.”
<a href="https://i.sli.mg/oQyL4F.png">https://i.sli.mg/oQyL4F.png</a></p>
<p>More recently, DynCorp acquired the high-powered firm Casals and Associates Inc. who have also received US government contracts in Africa and Latin America and as well as the Caribbean. 
<a href="https://i.sli.mg/epnDWP.png">https://i.sli.mg/epnDWP.png</a></p>
<p>Casals and Associates have been awarded another major contract worth estimated at $500 million in partnership with USAID. The firm works to support USAID in international legal matters.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Activities may include reforming legal frameworks..”
“…(to) support USAID efforts in responding to the rule of law challenges and developing human rights cultures.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This enormous contract gives USAID significant power to influence, reform or even remake the judicial systems of sovereign countries.</p>
<p><a href="https://i.sli.mg/jww4KJ.png">https://i.sli.mg/jww4KJ.png</a> </p>
<p>Let’s examine a 2008 Wikileaks email concerning DynCorp and another contracting company called PAE.
<a href="https://wikileaks.org/plusd/cables/08PORTAUPRINCE1643_a.html">https://wikileaks.org/plusd/cables/08PORTAUPRINCE1643_a.html</a></p>
<p>Jim Bean, the civilian police (CIVPOL) and International Development (INL) director is been given a tour of the current projects that were underway in the Haitian capital at that time. Bean oversaw the State Department contract for training CIVPOL in Haiti.</p>
<p>At the time, DynCorp International (DI) was involved in the construction of a new police station at Cite Soleil, expanding a prison that was operating at 400% above capacity, and planning the construction of new women’s prison 45 minutes outside of Port-au-Prince. </p>
<p><a href="https://i.sli.mg/FO9l4q.png">https://i.sli.mg/FO9l4q.png</a> </p>
<p>This new women’s prison may be of particular interest to the investigation of human trafficking. As Webb suggests, Haiti may be used as a ‘holding area’ for trafficked women and children. However, I was unable to find any additional information about female prisons in Haiti or find any evidence that the proposed prison was ever completed, thus far.</p>
<p>The US embassy in Port-au-Prince, in particular the Narcotics Affairs Section (NAS), is very much involved with Haitian development projects and capacity building. The NAS has a multitude of initiatives in Haiti from counter-narcotics to anti-money laundering programs which are conducted in coordination with MINUSTAH forces.
<a href="https://i.sli.mg/j32km4.png">https://i.sli.mg/j32km4.png</a></p>
<p>A 2008, US State Department Contract in Haiti and Liberia for <strong>$7 million dollars</strong> illustrates DynCorp’s involvement in the HNP. DynCorp provided training for at least 444 HNP officers. In 2013, DynCorp is awarded yet another contract in Haiti for training and providing support to police worth <strong>$48.6 million dollars</strong>. The contract is issued by the US State Department through the Criminal Justice Program Support (CJPS) initiative. </p>
<p>From Dyncorp International’s website, the company highlights their training of U.N. Police in Haiti (UNPOL – aka - MINUSTAH) and HNP officers through US State Department contracts.

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;We are proud to support this important program to enhance the rule of law in Haiti and help contribute to future economic development” … &quot;The DI team is pleased to expand our support and continue working with the HNP.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>With all of these resources being poured into Haiti in terms of government contracts, police personnel training, international police recruitment, prison construction, international legal assistance, correctional advisor training, counter-narcotics activities, anti-money laundering and stabilization projects, you would expect that Haiti was seething with crime and overflowing with criminals. You may be surprised to learn that, in fact, the opposite is true. Haiti has the lowest crime rate in the Caribbean.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.counterpunch.org/2014/12/26/inside-the-occupation-of-haiti/">http://www.counterpunch.org/2014/12/26/inside-the-occupation-of-haiti/</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The peaceful territory of Haiti, which has the <strong>lowest crime</strong> rate in the Caribbean, is occupied by more than 19,627 armed personnel. Specifically, at the last count on October 31, 2014, there was a domestic force of 11,228 established police and 1,144 in training, plus a United Nations force of 4,965 “peacekeeping” troops and 2,290 police officers. This occupation force amounts to about one machine-gun toting individual for about every 500 Haitians or fewer, even without counting the ubiquitous security people who guard the businesses and homes of the rich.
In theory, the international MINUSTAH and UNPOL police are distinct from the HNP force, yet the reality in Haiti is that it’s increasingly difficult to distinguish between these police forces.
The company who trains and provides personnel to the international contingency in Haiti is DynCorp. DynCorp is fully integrated into the HNP force.</p>

<p>A 2008, US State Department Contract in Haiti and Liberia for <strong>$7 million dollars</strong> illustrates DynCorp’s involvement in the HNP.</p>
<p><a href="https://i.sli.mg/nGsXEr.png">https://i.sli.mg/nGsXEr.png</a></p>
<p>DynCorp provided training for at least 444 HNP officers and, as previously mentioned, it was responsible for the construction of a new police station in Cite Soleil. The DynCorp International website states that the new station will:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“function as the primary location for this new specialized unit.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>According to Dady Chery (Counterpunch article above / Haitian writer - www.dadychery.org), the HNP record has been less than stellar over the past decade.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In keeping with their training by MINUSTAH, or rather DynCorp via MINUSTAH, more than 600 members of the PNH (variously called BIM, CIMO, UDMO, BLT, DCPR, Politour, etc. for their specializations) have been dismissed from the force for crimes that include rape, drug trafficking, and murder, the most recent purge being in June 2014. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>As a result, Haiti has a de facto US police force serving the population that ultimately protects US interests in Haiti and the region. For Haitians, this is nothing new as Western powers have a long history of interfering in the nation’s affairs. There have been police forces with foreign allegiances in Haiti’s not so distant past.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Then a US-loyal gendarmerie, which answered directly to the US Secretary of State, was set up to replace the highly regarded national army. The gendarmes functioned like a mafia that lived from extortion; furthermore, even after the occupation, they stood ever ready to organize countless bloody coups d’état on orders from Washington. For example, General Paul Magloire’s coup against President Dumarsais Estimé in 1950 was a US-sponsored action via the gendarmerie, as was the 1991 coup against President Jean-Bertrand Aristide.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>Let’s review.</h3>
<p>DynCorp contractors, who have a history of sex trafficking in Bosnia/Kosovo, who have been caught overbilling (defrauding) the US government of tens of millions, a company who is implicated in the CIA extraordinary rendition program involving kidnapping and torture is <strong>regularly</strong> awarded enormous State Department contracts to train police forces in Iraq, Afghanistan and in this case Haiti. </p>
<p>DynCorp involvement in Haiti:</p>
<ul>
<li>Police training (DynCorp = Int. &amp; dom. forces = HNP / MINUSTAH)</li>
<li>Police recruitment (DynCorp = MINUSTAH = HNP)</li>
<li>Police station construction (For Dyncorp trained MINUSTAH and HNP)</li>
<li>Corrections training (PBSI, DynCorp partner)</li>
<li>Legal and Judicial Reform (USAID - Casals and Associates Inc. = DynCorp)</li>
<li>Prison construction (Men / women)</li>
<li>Counter-Narcotics (NAS – US embassy)</li>
</ul>
<p>Finally, it has been documented that the presence of Private Military and Security Companies (PMSC) increases the demand for prostitution and by extension sex trafficking.</p>

<p>Human Trafficking: The Unintended Effects of United Nations Intervention</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Preceding the deployment of MINUSTAH in Haiti, the NGO community made no attempt to publicize, research or assist victims of a global sex trafficking industry, suggesting that such networks were absent in Haiti prior to the arrival of the UN. In short, we demonstrate that prior to the introduction of UN forces, there was an absence of global human trafficking networks in Kosovo, Haiti and Sierra Leone. After the introduction of UN forces, human trafficking networks grew in all three cases.</p>

           DynCorp provided training for at least 444 HNP officers and, as previously mentioned, it was responsible for the construction of a new police station in Cite Soleil. The DynCorp International website states that the new station will:

          <p>
           According to Dady Chery (Counterpunch article above / Haitian writer - www.dadychery.org), the HNP record has been less than stellar over the past decade.

          <blockquote>
           <p>
            In keeping with their training by MINUSTAH, or rather DynCorp via MINUSTAH, more than 600 members of the PNH (variously called BIM, CIMO, UDMO, BLT, DCPR, Politour, etc. for their specializations) have been dismissed from the force for crimes that include rape, drug trafficking, and murder, the most recent purge being in June 2014.

           As a result, Haiti has a de facto US police force serving the population that ultimately protects US interests in Haiti and the region. For Haitians, this is nothing new as Western powers have a long history of interfering in the nation’s affairs. There have been police forces with foreign allegiances in Haiti’s not so distant past.

            Then a US-loyal gendarmerie, which answered directly to the US Secretary of State, was set up to replace the highly regarded national army. The gendarmes functioned like a mafia that lived from extortion; furthermore, even after the occupation, they stood ever ready to organize countless bloody coups d’état on orders from Washington. For example, General Paul Magloire’s coup against President Dumarsais Estimé in 1950 was a US-sponsored action via the gendarmerie, as was the 1991 coup against President Jean-Bertrand Aristide.

           Let’s review.
          </h3>
          <p>
           DynCorp contractors, who have a history of sex trafficking in Bosnia/Kosovo, who have been caught overbilling (defrauding) the US government of tens of millions, a company who is implicated in the CIA extraordinary rendition program involving kidnapping and torture is
           <strong>
            regularly
           </strong>
           awarded enormous State Department contracts to train police forces in Iraq, Afghanistan and in this case Haiti.
          </p>
          <p>
           DynCorp involvement in Haiti:
          </p>
          <ul>
           <li>
            Police training (DynCorp = Int. &amp; dom. forces = HNP / MINUSTAH)
           </li>
           <li>
            Police recruitment (DynCorp = MINUSTAH = HNP)
           </li>
           <li>
            Police station construction (For Dyncorp trained MINUSTAH and HNP)
           </li>
           <li>
            Corrections training (PBSI, DynCorp partner)
           </li>
           <li>
            Legal and Judicial Reform (USAID - Casals and Associates Inc. = DynCorp)
           </li>
           <li>
            Prison construction (Men / women)
           </li>
           <li>
            Counter-Narcotics (NAS – US embassy)
           </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
           Finally, it has been documented that the presence of Private Military and Security Companies (PMSC) increases the demand for prostitution and by extension sex trafficking.

           Human Trafficking: The Unintended Effects of United Nations Intervention
          </p>
          <blockquote>
           <p>
            Preceding the deployment of MINUSTAH in Haiti, the NGO community made no attempt to publicize, research or assist victims of a global sex trafficking industry, suggesting that such networks were absent in Haiti prior to the arrival of the UN. In short, we demonstrate that prior to the introduction of UN forces, there was an absence of global human trafficking networks in Kosovo, Haiti and Sierra Leone. After the introduction of UN forces, human trafficking networks grew in all three cases.

            I upvoated this about two weeks ago and then happened upon some interesting information I was thinking you may be able to confirm or look into with your notes. Robert Wadman who was a key player and partner in the disgusting Franklin/Boystown scand and went scot free (involving of course more coverup and connections) went on to become a PhD and professor at Weber University. In this article it mentions his work with ICITAP and his part in training police in Albania, Poland, Haiti and Nigeria. He was eventually not re-hired on account of his past but I would love to see where his involvement was and was it with Dyncorp?

             This is very interesting, I had no idea that Wadman was involved in International Police Training (ICITAP).
            </p>
            <p>
             From the link in the article you provided it clearly states that ICITAP works very closely with the State Department / USAID and other gov. agencies. The majority of contracts awarded to DynCorp come from State Dept. / USAID / DoD...so i think there's a good chance that he worked for or with DynCorp. DyCorp have had contracts with Haiti / Nigeria / Kosovo-Bosnia (Albania's right there) but not sure about Poland.

              Thought you'd find it useful. Now also this- Sandusky/Penn/2nd Mile also related to Franklin &amp; FBI:
Graham Spanier (Pres of Penn State at  time) long time good friends with none other than Ronald Roskens ( confirmed &amp; outed perp of Franklin Scandal &amp; very close friends with Bush) Roskens ended up HEAD of USAID. Spanier also ended up with US gov't job dealing with National Security (never confirmed what) !!!!!

            Great work OP.   I don't think the public are aware just how much corporate welfare is given to companies such as dyncorp and all to go into these countries and set up basically a police state.   The government is counting on public ignorance because the obvious question is why is billions being spent on opening prisions etc in Haiti, and other such countries?   I think we need to pull this information together in a way that can bring attention to this and raise awareness among the public.  We need the public to start asking why are dyncorp etc getting tax dollars to set up a police state in haiti?  I think most of the public we just give humanitarian aid.   Once they get control of the countries legal, police, and prison system - how is it that rapes, trafficking, etc increase exponentially?

            If I started a charity to fix all this stuff (secure, shelter, feed, educate, and economically empower poor Haitians), who would donate?
           </p>
           <p>
            Imagine there being an autonomous region in Haiti whose people owed their freedom to Pizzagate! That would be a real contribution to the future of this planet I think.

             Why the fuck is it necessary for euroethnic communities to 'educate' subsaharran cannibals on shelter, food, eduction and economic empowerment... subsaharrans cannibals have been a culture 1000s of years longer than the European continent was even populated, cultural ways do not change, are Europeans just retarded or is their some weird shadow force manipulating their emotions and logic, every time a new baby is born, they are going to have the same innate cultural instincts as from meliniums past, no matter how much you pretend to train their parents!

                    It's very strange to talk to someone who is actually afraid to learn something new. What are you scared will happen if you look up the Arawak name for Haiti on Wikipedia? It's silly.

            This is a world wide issue but there are certainly areas that are more ripe for the taking, (see: poor) Make sure to do your searches on these subjects including subsidiaries of Dyncorp. A guy I knew used to be the CEO of KBR, another govt contractor and sub of Dyncorp. KBR was taken to court over a case where they had lured 13 Nepalese men to Iraq with all kinds of promises. Took their passports once they arrived. And then sent them to work in a very dangerous area, which the men had NOT signed up for. On the way, their vehicle was attacked and 12 of the men were killed. The 13th lived to tell the tale. My point is that the trafficking going on is not just for women and children. The reason I got curious about KBR is bc years ago (around the time of article below) the CEO said that a "good"  day was when only 1 or 2 people died. I couldn't figure out at the time how that many contractors could die and it not be reported in the news. I have a much better grasp of the statement now.

             Just to let you know KkR is once again part of the military industrial complex dedicated to topple governments. Creating havoc and hell and death for its citizens so it can make money off of war profiteering. DAVID Patreus is de facto leader with Henry Kissinger and Neil Brown (that's right married to the missing CEO of Clinton Foundation Eric Braverman(identified already as possibly a noc as was His partner Neil Brown. This corruption is disgusting. Involved Dyncorp/CIA as usual. Child trafficking.Organ harvesting see George Webb YouTube. Also prayer for our nation.

              Are you referring to KK&amp;R? That's a different co than KBR. I've watched all of GW's videos and have t heard him mention KBR. (Kellog Brown and Root) Similar to Halliburton, also a sub of Dyncorp.

            Fantastic post, one of the top ones, thanks for the effort! So the Haitians among others are being robbed of their lives, homes, resources, sovereignty, dignity, freedom, and the final insult, their fucking children. Good god

              Check ou Sean Penn's connections to DyncorpCIA. Also the El Chapo capture this followed Obama and Holders fast and furious to run guns into Mexico to turn gangs an each other. And give Sinola all power. Some of this guns game back even killed Border Agent Brian Terry.?
Those guns are on the loose now supplied by Obama administration. El Chapo was just out along with Carlos Slim of bankrolling all the recent Hollywood movies which are a depiction of this horror. Notice how Sean Penn "somehow" gained acess to El Chapo while he was FBI most wanted. Onto the Hollywood connection Eyes wide shut, The hunger games a spin on their human hunting of children. It is worse than we ever thought.?

            I just checked the Sli.mg links and they no longer connect.
           </p>
           <p>
            Please see the Steemit.com link at the top, the images uploaded to Sli.mg are still functional.
           </p>

            I read about Archive.is and Sli.mg being compromised yesterday.
