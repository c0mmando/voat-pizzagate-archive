            I like this theory. I hope that's the truth. We can't ignore the tremendous clusterfuck currently going on behind the curtains right now, and the clock is ticking on the Obama administration.

            On what logic are you basing your theory that Trump is 99% not involved in Pizzagate? Did he not seem to have knowledge of Epstein's crusades through his comments? He will also become president, which seems unlikely were he not also compromised in that way. No offense but what makes Trump so special? He is a billionaire and has moved in these circles for a long time. The most obvious answer is that he is saying nothing becaiae he is implicated or at risk . He will do absolutely nothing.
