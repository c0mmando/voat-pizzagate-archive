<p>Suppose we imagine what the broader picture looks like. </p>
<p>This is only one <em>possible</em> framework within which to make sense of the data we have been seeing. It might be way off, or it might make sense. Can\'t make any accusations for sure until more evidence rolls in. </p>
<p>Let\'s go through the hypothetical process. Imagine you are a sadistic pedo with a lot of money (sorry, I know you\'re not, but try to imagine being part of this shit for a moment). </p>
<p>Suppose you are politically connected and it is too risky to just kidnap kids on the streets. So you get referred by a friend (who knows someone who knows someone) to one of the restaurants. </p>
<p>(These restaurants and fronts/dealers are presumably all over the globe, even though we\'ve been questioning a DC location by happenstance.) </p>
<p>Maybe this is how they\'re doing the process? <a href="https://sli.mg/3YFeHP">https://sli.mg/3YFeHP</a></p>
<p>The hypothesized possibility is as follows:</p>
<p>What are your tastes? If you are looking for ordinary &quot;pizza&quot;, maybe you are told to go to Comet Ping Pong? If you are a big spender and you\'re into the more hardcore &quot;activities&quot; where the food is &quot;finished&quot;, do you go to Bucks? <a href="http://www.bucksfishingandcamping.com/">http://www.bucksfishingandcamping.com/</a></p>
<p><strong>Are Comet Ping Pong Pizza and Buck\'s the dealers?</strong></p>
<p>Is it possible that these fronts are not actually hosting the rapes and torture, but merely providing a &quot;menu&quot; and a place to make transactions?</p>
<p>Perhaps you are told to give key personnel of the relevant restaurant an indication that you are in the know, and that you want to see the <em>real</em> menu? Maybe this involves, say, showing the owner a coin with an embedded pedo symbol on it (per the FBI document) to clue him in that you are a legit buyer?</p>
<p>The dealer, now knowing that you are legit, tells you what is available (infants maybe, or haitan children, for example). You then specify the &quot;product&quot; you want and make an untraceable transaction, maybe with foreign currency?</p>
<p>You are then given instructions on how to pick up your product. </p>
<p><strong>Are Politics and Prose and the underground exit and entry points via Connecticut functioning as drop-off locations?</strong></p>
<p>Are you then given instructions and told the time to pick up your product? For example, maybe the child you ordered will be waiting for you in the children\'s section, downstairs, of Politics and Prose at a certain time/day? </p>
<p><strong>Is the Haiti facility across the street storing inventory?</strong></p>
<p>Or is it a different facility? Where is the supply of children stored, or where is it transferred in from? Do the inventory operators receive word from the dealer that a purchase has been made, and do they begin transporting the product to the drop-off point?</p>
<p>What about fake day care centers or remote addresses, could these possibly be where inventory is stocked? </p>
<p>Now what about the big players? The SOURCES?  The suppliers?</p>
<p>**Are the &quot;refugee rescue&quot; organizations and relief centers and the foundations the suppliers of thousands of products?&quot;</p>
<p>What are these big players? If they are relief foundations and &quot;child protection&quot; orgs they would have access to thousands of chlidren to transport en masse to dealers/fronts around the globe. </p>
<p>Maybe they are going to countries like Haiti or Turkey to get the children, since many children there don\'t have paperwork and can easily be snatched up? </p>
<p>Is Silsby getting caught taking 33 children from Haiti an example of a supplier messing up? </p>
<p><strong>Low-level scouts and kidnappers</strong></p>
<p>These would be the hardcore people who get their hands dirty and probably aren\'t joking about it on instagram. No idea who they are. </p>
<p><strong>Independent scouts and repositories</strong></p>
<p>These could include acting agencies for children in Hollywood, producers, Hollywood moguls, as well as orphanages, foster care organizations, foster parents, etc. Essentially places or individuals that act as bastions for children, repositories if you will. </p>
<p><strong>Guards</strong></p>
<p>These would be lawmakers, attorneys, judges, certain police officials, and maybe even presidents and senators who are elected to their positions to pass laws and provide cover for critical elements of the operation. </p>
<p><strong>Brokers and middle-men, record keepers and blackmailers</strong></p>
<p>Are the Podesta brothers and Epstein and their ilk helping to conduct deals and keep the gears running smoothly? Are these the people who arbitrate and ensure silence via the use of filmed activities for blackmail purposes? </p>
<p>Are they selling some of the information to foreign governments in deals that are in the high 7 figures? </p>
<p>For example, are they hosting &quot;parties&quot; on private jets or in &quot;art&quot; galleries beneath their mansions, where some of the activity is performed and filmed for control measures and blackmail? </p>
<p>Do these people occasionally &quot;dip into the supply&quot; for themselves? Are these the people who hold most of the power in that they have the dirt on everybody? </p>
<p>Tony Podesta is regarded as THE most powerful lobbyist in DC. How does one get to that point? Why did Epstein keep a black book of names? Are these the controllers and brokers? </p>
<p><strong>Buyers</strong></p>
<p>Buyers could range from wealthy libertines and sexual sadists who want thrills (perhaps they want to try rape and torture and murder for fun), organ smugglers, pimps, illegal porn producers, politicians, etc. But perhaps the most chilling kinds of buyers would be these obscure Crowley cults who believe in ritual sacrifices, and covert agencies who are conducting experiments to test the limits of psychological conditioning and control (all the MK ultra stuff we\'ve been seeing). </p>
<p>Just some possibilities to consider. </p>
<p>One can\'t be sure about any of this without documented hard proof, but exploring the possibilities and asking questions can be important in guiding future research.</p>',
