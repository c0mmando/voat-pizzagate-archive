            Yes, Sater (satyr?) is yet another evil Jew in this sordid tale.
           </p>
           <p>
            He will sing like a canary to save his own skin.  He has done it before.
           </p>
           <p>
            (Bolding mine)
           </p>
           <p>
            <strong>
             <strong>
              "Sater is undoubtedly one of the more unsavory people the president has conducted business with. He was famously involved in a clash at a bar where he stabbed another man in the face with the stem of a martini glass, an assault that landed him in prison for a year.  He pleaded guilty to racketeering as part of a $40 million stock fraud scheme orchestrated by the Mafia but avoided jail time by becoming a valuable federal informant for the FBI and CIA. Andrew Weissmann, the prosecutor who negotiated that plea deal, has been hired by Robert Mueller.
             </strong>
            </strong>
           </p>
           <p>
            Then-U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of New York Loretta Lynch said in a letter to Sen. Orrin Hatch during her confirmation as Barack Obama’s Attorney General that Sater provided “information crucial to national security and the conviction of over 20 individuals, including those responsible for committing massive financial fraud and
            <strong>
             <strong>
              members of La Cosa Nostra.”
             </strong>
            </strong>
           </p>
           <p>
            In 2002, Sater reinvented himself, working at a real estate development firm called Bayrock Group.
            <strong>
             <strong>
              Bayrock’s offices are conveniently located on the 24th floor of Trump Tower in New York, which is where the paths of Sater and Trump cross.  In a 2008 sworn deposition Sater said he would pitch Trump business deals (“just me and him”) on a “constant basis.”
             </strong>
            </strong>
           </p>
           <p>
            By around 2005, Trump began licensing his name for real estate developments in New York and Florida. He struck up an exclusive deal with Bayrock to develop a property in Russia, a deal which later fell through while the others remained.
           </p>
           <p>
            The same 2008 deposition reveals more of the casual nature of the business relationship between Sater and Trump.
            <strong>
             <strong>
              Sater says he would “pop [his] head into Mr. Trump’s office” to tell him how the Russia deal was coming along. According to Sater, Trump asked him to escort Donald Jr. and Ivanka Trump during their 2006 trip to Moscow.
             </strong>
            </strong>
           </p>
           <p>
            Looming in the background of all this, however, is Sater’s murky and checkered past.
            <strong>
             <strong>
              In 2007, Bayrock Group became a partner in Trump’s SoHo property.
             </strong>
            </strong>
            The property offering plan to New York State says that there were “no prior felony convictions of Sponsor [Bayrock], or any principals of Sponsor.” In December of 2007, The New York Times ran an article unearthing Sater’s criminal history. Two days later, Trump was deposed in a lawsuit. He stated multiple times that he had “very little” interaction with Sater. Despite this, in 2010 Sater toted around a business card that read he was a “senior adviser” at the Trump Organization.
           </p>
           <p>
            <strong>
             <strong>
              Trump has stated repeatedly that he doesn’t know who Sater is
             </strong>
            </strong>
            and denied any meaningful relationship, maintaining that all deals were done directly with Bayrock, not Sater (who was employed by Bayrock.) In a 2013 deposition tape for a lawsuit about alleged fraud in a Fort Lauderdale condo Sater helped develop, Trump said he wouldn’t recognize Sater if he were sitting in the same room with him.
            <strong>
             <strong>
              When asked in a 2013 BBC Panorama interview about why Trump remained in a deal with Sater considering his past with the Mafia, Trump walked off set."

             A father of kid I went to High School with was involved in that $40 million pump and dump scheme.  He wasn't directly involved, but I believe those who were paid him.  He was a senior mob member and eventually did 15 years for other crimes.  (He was not a Jew.)
