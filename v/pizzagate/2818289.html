“ Because the site is based in Switzerland, its rules about child porn are more relaxed.”
Jailbait: In 2011, <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/jailbait">/r/jailbait</a>, one of Reddit\'s most popular communities, was shut down. The subreddit featured suggestive photos of underage girls, most of which were ripped from their social media pages without permission. According to Gawker, pedophiles used the forum to connect and privately trade child pornography. 
Voat now has its own network of jailbait forums. And because the site is based in Switzerland, its rules about child porn are more relaxed. &quot;Do not post anyone under the assumed age of 16 fully nude,&quot; the sidebar reads. &quot;If they are younger please post them with some key areas covered. This is done to protect Voat legally from Swiss law.&quot;
Some redditors are uncomfortable with these groups, or &quot;subverses,&quot; as they\'re called on Voat. &quot;It\'s seriously messed up, and they should be taken down,&quot; one person wrote.</p>
<p>Creepshots: Another banned Reddit community is now an active group on Voat. On the late <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/creepshots">/r/creepshots</a>, users shared real sexualized photos of women and girls taken in public without their permission. These included upskirt shots in malls and covert cellphone images of students in school. One high school substitute teacher in Georgia was fired in 2012 after allegedly uploading a photo he took of a girl in his class. </p>
<p>Go ahead and look up all these subs yourselves. I went to see if they existed and they do . I am sickened by what I saw in the thumbnails ! 
Here are just a few . Who knows how many of these types of subs there really are here ?

            Didnt seem to be anything more than beautiful women in public wearing clothes they obviously wanted to be noticed in. At least that was the front page.
           </p>
           <p>
            So are photos of beautiful women in public supposed to be bad now?

             Well I guess I have my answer then .  Pretty sure most of those commenting frequent those subs.. why else would I get comments and downvoats immediately after posting, from people I’ve never seen on pg ?

            Quickest way to identify a pedo is someone who wants those subverses to stay on this website. 
Obscenity is regulated in the U.S. so presumably it can be regulated as to the people living in the U.S. accessing the website, hence, the reason no U.S. resident or citizen in their right mind would want to go around looking at NSFW subverses "just to investigate."
           </p>
           <p>
            Wasn't that what hojoruku was doing when the people on Voat decided he was a shill? You post or host CP you should be assumed to be against the goals of this forum.
           </p>
           <p>
            I can't speak for why the owners of Voat would allow this to be a forum on their site. I did see a post claiming that the owner just sits around raking in bitcoin and doesn't monitor the site to try and save it when it gets attacked. I guess maybe he isn't aware it's on his site.
           </p>
           <p>
            Anyone with enough points can create a subverse.
           </p>
           <p>
            I've noticed that a few friends of users on this forum were accused of making comments about liking under age girls and CP.

            does not appear to be that active. Last post was like 9 months ago, and most of the stuff is archived. There are a few zombie subs here that are like that.

            there are a lot of subverses that were pretty creepy, but have been abandoned due to the people being chased off for being nigger faggots, and a few transgenders that got doxxed.

            Why the fuck did you not investigate? That is what the random nsfw subverse button is for, as well as the random subverse button. People need to use those. Not just for investigations but to see what sort of things are here, like stuff you might like.

              I'm saying Gawker's concern for children is disingenuous because they're actually pro child rape as the article I provided amply demonstrates and are merely using the exploitation of Voat's freedom of speech/expression philosophy by paedophiles to post abhorrent, but not technically illegal, pictures of children (YouTube has the same problem; there are numerous videos of little girls doing gymnastics on that site which are indubitably ice cream for nonces, but aren't technically illegal or in violation of their ToS and thus cannot be removed but I'm not aware of any righteous indignation from Gawker regarding Elsagate or the aforementioned 'gymnastics' videos) as an excuse to attack this site.  The subs referred to have been exposed and roundly condemned here in the past.

               So like back in the day when we use to expose pedophiles on the internet and we would search night and day looking for these degenerates and all we had to do was click on over to vjailbait and find thousands of them ?

                     Well if they are posting photos to the forums and those photos have CP in them then it technically hosts CP even if that wasn't the intended purpose of the site. I found at least one thumbnail of a post in a forum called PedosOnVoat which was intended (supposedly) to expose pedophiles that appeared to be underage girls in a  sexually provocative photo with underwear on, so I assume that the person who posted that could have seen more than what he was posting when he created the thread. I also heard there is a frequent user named Aged who is a huge pedo, and entire forums exist for posting the photos.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     I also saw an old post claiming we don't know who owns Voat. Apparently it's PuttItOut but we don't know who he is. All we know is it's a .co.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     Sorry I do not know more or have proof, that is the realm of law enforcement and I'm not about to click on the forums, though I have encountered many users who try to bait me into doing so.
