<p>Billy ... 
Perhaps you know that so-called &quot;Mother Theresa&quot; is soon to be canonised, in a high-speed process.
But you yourself said to me, in regard to this woman, that she is a criminal who, under the cover of faith and religion, commits, respectively committed - because in the meantime she has died - grave wrongdoings. 
As I know from you and from various terrestrial sources, she was a child-robber who stole children from many Indian mothers and sold them for a lot of money to childless foreigners. In cooperation with other sisters of her order she told the mothers, from whom she stole the children, that the children entrusted to her had died, and so forth. 
Furthermore she also raked in dollars by the millions by means of donations which were entrusted to her for the purpose of alleviating the need of those who were suffering and to build hospitals and nursing homes, and so forth.
But all the many dollars, which, not very long ago, you indicated to me was 3,500,000,000 - and which, in large part, Mother Theresa got through begging and underhanded means from the Federal heads and finance bosses, and so forth - was never utilised for the purposes indicated by her. Only a few dollars actually flowed out for the named purposes while most of the remainder, namely more than 1,700,000,000 - if I correctly recall your statements  - were carried to Rome by the deceiver in order to fill the papal coffers. Can one let that hang in the air and also openly make this public, or had I better remain silent over it?</p>
<p>Ptaah...
Yes. All of what we discussed is correct.</p>',

            It's funny, grandma said her mother was Algonquin, from the Micmac tribes. Tough, loving people.  I think, broadly speaking , the Catholic faith was taught harshly.  The nuns were TOUGH.  But, I have such a love for them, because they taught the fullness of the Faith. I think a lot of the. Came from sad, tough, harsh circumstances.   Quebec has such lovely churches.

            I am so sorry, and it saddens me that this happened to you.  To destroy a close family relationship is NOT God's will. The idea is subsidiarity has gone out the window.   Just think of the Holy Family - poor and powerless.  This idea of 'Social Justice' is a relatively new movement in the Church.  Set up in the late 1800s, it was meant to counteract the sins of greed and pride.  It is out of control, and there are people within the Church who are prideful.  I hope that you can find a humble priest and parish, ( hopefully one that is centered on the Eucharist.  Reform comes from within ( St. Teresa of Avile)"  God bless, Hope you're have a Holy Lent.  I will be off VOAT for 40 days ;)

            Sorry to read you have such a negative view of the Catholic Church.  It is a beautiful institution, and Her teachings are true.  Perhaps you need to pick up a Catechism and read about the teachings of Baptism, and Confirmation.  They are Jesus Christ's gifts to us.  Sorry to hear you cried during your Confirmation.  I wish I paid more attention to it when I was confirmed.  It is very beautiful, to think of the gifts we receive, if we are open to it.  Ash Wednesday is tomorrow.  Peace.

            Catholicism uses Christianity to maintain its power and get more money but its leaders are Satanists. Virtue signaling at its finest.

            Im sorry to say this but God in not here because he doesn't exist. Why all this suffering when he could just blink an eye and make all things good. Why is the idea of Satan still going on. God could blink him away too. Open your mind but not so much your brains fall out. Peace to you. I mean you no harm. Its time to wake up and realize we all are responsible for our own actions. God isn't fixing anything. Its up to you. I can't explain how the universe came about and I doubt anyone can. But I believe that life..... just happens because it does.

             Why don't you be responsible for your own actions and put out some statements based on reason?  If you' "can't explain how the universe came", then how can you claim ' no God'?  At least try to be intellectually honest before you throw out philosophical pablum.

            Just stopped lurking and signed up.  I volunteered at Mother Teresa's home for Children in Port-au-Prince Haiti about 15 or so years ago.  I was there for about 3 months.  I never detected any evidence of trafficking at that location at that time.  The children were seldom orphans, they were brought there because they were sick.  Parents were allowed to come twice a week to visit.  We had one orphan who aaaawas to be adopted to a couple in Germany, but before leaving he was found to have AIDS and could not go.  The sisters were quite sad.
           </p>
           <p>
            However I did not find the sisters to be warm to the children with a few exceptions.  They seemed focused on doing good deeds for getting in good with God and doing their religious rituals for the same reason.  They may have also have had caring fatigue.  Certainly it was a huge undertaking.  Volunteers are not solicited or provided room and board.  If they come they can help.  If not the staff and the nuns do it all.  Medical care can get quite haphazard just because of the heavy load.
           </p>
           <p>
            I was somewhat disillusioned by the lack of emotional caring for the kids.  Later I became more disillusioned with Mother Teresa when I explored volunteering with unwed mothers in the US.  I did not like the attitude about them but I can no longer put my finger on just what that was.
           </p>
           <p>
            Michael Parenti wrote a rather scathing article about her
            <a href="http://www.michaelparenti.org/motherteresa.html">
             http://www.michaelparenti.org/motherteresa.html
            </a>
            All I can say is she is not what most people think she is, but I can be pretty sure that at the children's home in Port-au-Prince in the mid 90's I saw no evidence of trafficking children.  I did see children get well and go home.  I did see children die - one in a crib right next to where I was working.  I did see a child brought in who was so emaciated it looked like parchment draped over bones.  The sisters called for the head sister to baptize the child.  There was nothing to do.  I did hold a child while a nurse vainly tried to put in a needle for intravenous feeding.  I have a strong stomach but for some reason that was particularly hard for me.  I saw the desperation of a country overpopulated, over exploited, and the victim of imperialist country's such as the US and France.
           </p>
           <p>
            Even without trafficking life was bad.  I hope the order Mother Teresa founded is not trafficking for I think that most of the sisters are honest and sincere and we don't need one more organization feeding on children.

             Thank you for your witness, and works for the poor.  Do not let these posts discourage you about the sisters of charity.  These people posting here are very ignorant of the Churchs' great works for the poor.  These people need to get off their computers and go volunteer somewhere

             If your not In their click, You're kept in the dark. They don't do this openly and I doubt its with every single child they come across. They'd be busted in a minute if it were all of the children. Its probably a very small amount TIMES several hundred locations.

              It may be that they were trafficking a few kids, but the kids came in clearly sick, got visits from their parents, left with parents.  I didn't follow every kid.  There were a few orphans there who were not sick.  I never saw one of them leave while I was there, and they seemed to have been there for some time.
             </p>
             <p>
              It is possible that some places run by the sisters are run differently depending on the head nun.
             </p>
             <p>
              Have you ever visited any of Mother Teresa's homes, volunteered there?  I was careful in my post to state what I knew and what I didn't.  Folks really need to be careful not to destroy something that does good.
             </p>
             <p>
              When kids came in they were first given de-wormers.  I remember on my first day seeing a kid vomit up a foot long worm.  Getting them free from parasites that were stealing what little food they had was good.  I helped one child in particular.  A boil was treated on her knee but when it was healed she had a contraction of the muscles.  I helped her stretch the leg gently so she could walk again.  If you paint too wide a brush I could be considered a human trafficker because I volunteered at a place that is one of many places sponsored by an organization that someone accused of doing child trafficking.  Please folks don't let speculations become assertions without some proof.
             </p>
             <p>
              Consider that the sister in Sri Lanka who was arrested for trafficking might well have been someone who resisted trafficking any of her kids and the local politicians who wanted a kid might well have arrested and charged her for doing what she was preventing.  Anyone ever hear of people being framed because they won't go along with those in power.  Just saying folks need to not jump too quickly and take care that speculation doesn't outrun them.

             Since you mentioned The queen and the pope. Umm. Yes they had subpoenas to appear in court for Genocide, child trafficking and murder. Its been an on going case for over 20 yrs. A priest in Canada by the name of Kevin Annett was removed from his pulpit and financially ruined by the Church of Canada and the Vatican because he discovered mass graves of over 5000 children who were taken from foster care and orphanages in Canada. They have witnesses who testified that the Queen herself came and took like 15 kids from somewhere and those kids were never seen again.... The reason its been 20 yrs is when you take on the Queen of England and the Pope who both have trillions to spend on covering up something this large. Its a battle no man has experienced except for Kevin Annett. He has a website showing the court papers and a list of videos on the case. He has also appeared on the Alex Jones Infowars show. This is huge but its also being covered up big time.  See it here --&gt;

              And that Queen Beatrice isn't really royalty from Netherlands alledgedly.  That Pope Francis gave her false papers alledgedly. A big PsyOp trying to discredit him.  Very big disinformation , kind of like the moon missions and Fukushima.  Enormous effort on both sides is evidence of a coverup.

            I used to have a liking for St. Francis of Assisi because of the reported love of animals.  Now I am wondering.  I also remember seeing something on the internet about gay saints marrying during the 14th or 15th Century. If this is true they have screwed us over in so many ways.  Changing things in and out to favor their agenda.  We have been had because asleep.  I had wondered about some things along the way, but never thought it was this deep and horrible.  I never did like Ratzinger.  I remember that at the time of his being considered, that people in Germany were protesting.  I knew then that something was terribly wrong.

             We are living in a dream. Theres no real freedom In America or the world for that matter. Its a dictatorship. Right now !  We are in the age of Aquarius. The enlightenment epoch. Meaning something to the tone of awareness or knowledge. Don't get me wrong. Im not one of those Horoscope people who guess about things based on the position of the planets and stars.  But after some intense reading I did learn there is a hint of truth in this subject.  We are worker ants for the elite. We are literally paying them to destroy this world. The US gov says they took in 3.4 trillion in taxes.. BULL SHIT. Thats only income tax. The total taxes combined which is Income, State, City and sales tax is just about 7 trillion. 7,000,000,000,000 PER YEAR.. They allocate 5.3 BILLION for immigration and customs enforcement... REALLY ?  5.3 BILLION.. While most of Washington wants open borders.. Where is all that money going ?  The Obamacare website cost us 2 Billion... For a website ?  Its going into their pockets while we site and struggle day after week after month after year and FRICKING Decade. On and ON this nightmare keeps going.  But guess what. Its the start of the end of all that. I've often wondered how a hand full of people, comparatively. can control 7.3 billion people. Part of how that happened is citizens didn't cross check them from day one.  7.5 Billion VS a few thousand. Pff We got this.

             Because he's in on it. The Pope we have now is the last Pope. The Catholic church will end soon. Before he dies. Oh man. Thats gonna be a dozy. Billions of people will learn whats really going on in the church and they will tear it down. Brick by Brick.

               I believe it will. In short. This new world order is using them to implement their plan. DISRUPT everything so they can come in to save the day. The US has been doing that for hundreds of years. Its where the term False Flag comes into play. Make it look like its someone else doing all this crap then swoop in to save the day. If the NWO ever gets full control. The Muslims will be erased off the planet when their done using them. BLM too. They are simply being used to disrupt our nation.  Who in their right minds would want Crazy Muslims and retarded angry black people to be the norm on any world... NO ONE.. They are being used like puppets to distract us from the real deal. Global control. The mindset of Hitler isn't over yet. They just found a sneaky way of doing it this time. ... One more thing.. Merkel. She is a Jewish insurgent agent for the Zionist order, sent to destroy Europe. starting with Germany. Yes.. This is happening.

               Some people here still can't wrap their heads around the fact if you are rich or famous then you were allowed to become that way because you sold your soul to the ones having pizza parties. I think the celebs who are honestly not into that shit are incredibly small in number.

              Ghandi has been exposed as a British agent.  Britain wanted out of south Asia peacefully and not with a lot of blood or lost status so they propped him up as their leader and left (although still very much still in control.)
             </p>
             <p>
              Ghandi studied and trained in law at the Inner Temple, London and became a barrister (lawyer).

            Yes, thank God, for this site.  That is how I became red pilled about so many and so much, including Mother Theresa.  Never sent her any money for I have not been a practicing Catholic for years, but this was a surprise. I wonder how many other Saints were fakes.

              I never idolized any of the saints, really when I grew up.  Of course, since I went to Catholic school I did then.  Later not so much.  But never thought about them being fake.  Now not at all.  Have been away from the Church for years.

             Can you see now how religion is destroying our world ?  What kind of an all loving being threatens this creation with ETERNAL BURNING ?  Those are the words of dictators. Not a loving God.
