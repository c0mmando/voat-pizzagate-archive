            yes, this not intended to be conclusive, and I hope it is not read to be.
           </p>
           <p>
            However, two things are significant IMO:
           </p>
           <p>
            1) It is impossible he didn't understand the subtext of the good humor logo. Now that's not to say, it is conclusive about him as a person; it could be a sly attempt to be subversive; but the scale of Unilever, a massive company, reduces that probability because they retain such tight control over branding, so if it is a joke, they are in on it, and I wonder if it is a joke.
           </p>
           <p>
            2) Maybe this is unfair, but I think his Middle East connections are noteworthy. The media has done its best to hide from us the atrocities of Islam, but Saudi's have an exploitive, oppressive culture that would take a high-tolerance for corruption to situate there.
