<p>&quot;Five people were last week found guilty of <strong>human trafficking</strong> and illegal organ transplants in the first phase of the trial, including the urologist Lutfi Dervishi, the clinic’s director, and his son, Arban, who were sentenced to eight and seven years respectively.

&quot;the NATO documents are marked secret, and reveal that America and other western backing Kosovo\'s government &quot;have had extensive knowledge of its criminal connections for several years.. Haliti is linked with the Albanian mafia in the report, which also suggests that he is the person who &quot;exerts considerable control over Thaci&quot;. 
&quot;NATO documents to describe Haliti as &quot;highly involved in prostitution, weapons and drugs smuggling&quot;, who &quot;serves as a political and financial adviser to the prime minister&quot;.

If these leaders are criminals, if they face accusations of being criminals, they cannot create a democratic order,&quot; Lubonja said.</a> .....&quot;Verica Tomanović of the Association of the Families of the Missing Kosovo Serbs says that while this NGO knew that people were transferred from Kosovo to Albania, and that illegal prisons existed there, concrete data and lists of the victims were never revealed. &quot;When we talk about executions of non-Albanians in northern Albania, that was not done by Albanian citizens, but by KLA members. And that is the essence,&quot; Serbian War Crimes Prosecution spokesman Bruno Vekarić says.</p>
<p>&quot;Organ theft in Kosovo (sometimes also known as the &quot;yellow house&quot; case) refers to
the organ harvesting and killing of an indeterminate number of disappeared people.
Various sources had estimated that the number of victims ranged from a &quot;handful&quot;,[1]
up to 50,[2] between 24 to 100[3] to over 300.[4] The victims were believed to be
of Serbian nationality, killed by perpetrators with strong links to the Kosovo
Liberation Army (UÇK) in 1999.</p>

The officials charged that the KLA used terrorist tactics to assault Serbian and ethnic Albanian civilians in a campaign to achieve independence."

            Incredible work and detail. Information was breaking yesterday that Epstein has been connected to Kosovo. Also some of the doctors trained in organ transplant in Kosovo now work in the US. Webb was in Cleveland yesterday attempting to get some of the whisteblowers on tape.

            The name Thani should send chills down everyone's spine and get people digging. Also Albright attach her video about the justification of killing.

            Your reasearch is incredible! Thank you so much for your hard work! As a side note, it took me 3-4 times refreshing to get this to open. Each time it stated "under construction" ???

            I keep going back to when Andrew Breitbart tried to expose this in 2011 re: Podesta and MediaMatters. He called out John, but maybe it's was Podesta/all like Podesta Group? Keep digging everyone.

            Thank you for the great post!  Excellent work
I'm adding this blog link from 2000:

            "For years, Soros funded the American Committee to Save Bosnia, the Balkan Action Council, and a plethora of other groups devoted to persuading US policy makers that nothing less than American military intervention in the region could save the Kosovar Albanians from "genocide." Soros himself spoke out on the issue, and chided the West for "appeasing" the Serbs. Now comes the payoff. Trepca is his, or will be shortly. So we have finally come up with the answer to the question that has been haunting us for over a year: why Kosovo? The answer consists of two words: George Soros. All you would-be tycoons out there, take heed: If you want to know what investment strategy to follow in era of the Third Way, then Soros has certainly set the example."

            earlier in the article:
           </p>
           <p>
            ..."NATO's war on the last Serbs left in Kosovo: For the Trepca mining complex is an ancient treasure, mined by the Greeks, the Romans, the Turks, and is the richest source of lead and zinc in Europe. There is enough lignite deposits in those mines to last for the next 13 centuries. The capacity of Trepca's refineries ranks third worldwide. The now-deposed mine director reported that "in the last three years we have mined 2,538,124 tons of lead and zinc crude ore and produced 286,502 tons of lead and zinc and 139,789 tons of pure lead, zinc, cadmium, silver and gold." We don't need to ask why this action was taken: we have only to note Trepca's estimated value – over $5 billion.'

            Apparently it's not enough to destabilize nations for natural resources, the Global Mafia CF, CGI, Soros etc. etc. etc...(from George Webb's expose series), we know that the sick criminals will take profit from anything, baby parts, sexual slavery, organ harvesting, along with the long standing drugs and arms black market.  Soros claimed in his Mike Wallace interview that he was "saving" people from people like him.  We can easily add the unspoken follow-up..."so that no one could save the people from him."
           </p>
           <p>
            I recall the Soros WikiLeaks exposed his plan to exploit Albania, hiding behind the guise of "humanitarian" causes while keeping secret the spoils of war he really had his eye on.  But hey, we're supposed to be relieved by his contention that he feels no guilt for anything he exploits, because if he didn't do it, someone else would. (Typical criminal mindset).  And today we also know that he has had the biggest hard on for Russia for years.  Maybe he's biting off more than a subversive megalomaniac Nazi can chew?
