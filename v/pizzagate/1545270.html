            I'd say the death threats are working. I like the MK Ultra theory, and it would be a shame to see a patsy take the heat and sweep the whole business under the rug. That said, I don't think he's giving up any connections, and I don't see him catching any heat from authorities, because he is basically a made man in government pedomafia.

            You have to expect a massive disinformation campaign to be waged on here. Just look back at the JFK investigations to see what tricks will be played. If you are getting close there will be an attempt to find you and threaten you. Most disinformation is a truth revealed amongst a hundred lies, the trick is to figure out the truth. Alefantis reaction to the Pegasus info should mean it's a hot trail . However it's hard to believe he's that stupid, however he may be feeling the pressure and starting to crack. They will most certainly cut him loose and leave him out there if he shows signs of cracking. Killing him would only bring more heat.

              If that whole exchange between Alefantis and Ryan was real, and I think it was, simply because it shows two guys who are acting stupid because they are scared, then our boy is feeling the heat. I would think his connections have fled and now he's pretty much on his own. He knows there is a very good chance that they will kill him and if they don't they will set him up to take the fall. The only way to do that is to threaten his family. He's in a no win position now, cornered like a rat, he could do anything.

           </p>
           <p>
            I'm listening.
MK ultra exists and is much more prevalent than people think.
           </p>
           <p>
            I don't fully understand the satan connection but I do understand that it's about harnessing energy and possibly slipping dimensions.
           </p>
           <p>
            I also agree on the weed thing but it must be organic. There are many compromised strains which cause more harm than good.
           </p>
           <p>
            With regard to God, or the godhead etc. I keep an open mind but have no direct proof yet! Lots of evidence for satan which is an indicator!

            I agree with windowsinjudgement. This is my preferred tactic: We get the goods on Alefantis, but we gotta play good cop too, not just bad cop - so that he sings on Podesta/Clintons etc, and so that he sings to save the skin of the gay community from being tarred with this whole thing.
           </p>
           <p>
            Because this post is right - if the Elite hang Alefantis out to dry and we dont have enough on others, we will have failed picking the low hanging fruit

I had been meaning to making a post on PizzaGate for a while explaining exactly why I believe Alefantis / Comet Ping Pong and related things are most likely intentional "evidence" literally planned out and out in front of our faces deliberately as means to distract and lead us away from the relevent / legitimate evidence and information, as well as discredit everything about "PizzaGate". Which I should have done sooner considering now there's this whole mess with isthisgameofthrones only confirms my beliefs even more.
           </p>
           <p>
            Once the truth is realized that everything about this "killroom" nonsense is nothing but a wild goose chase distraction, and that this guy never fucking "talked to and was threatened by Alefantis" - it's probably going to be too late for anyone to fucking take us seriously anymore. They tried pushing the "fake news" bullshit, and have now resorted to infiltrating and actually getting people to believe this shit that really is "fake news". To make us look like a joke and use this against us as a way to discredit everything else we try to show people as evidence.
           </p>
           <p>
            The whole PizzaGate sub is basically compromised at this point. Look at the first few pages of posts right now - the majority of them are all related to isthisgameofthrones being "threatened" by Alefantis or posts about his stupid "killroom" wild goose chase nonsense.
           </p>
           <p>
            Nearly every legitimate, relevent leads that were previously being looked into have all been pushed to the side to focus on this "FAKE NEWS".
           </p>
           <p>
            And god forbid anyone attempt to say this on any of these posts - considering saying such things gets you almost instantly downvoted and called a "shill" by isthisgameofthrones and his hundreds of alt accounts, and all he naive people who believe him.

            My ex wife was involved in some very nefarious activities. She suffers from D.I.D. which is consistent with other  things(prostitution, child trafficking etc) and was ritually abused. My children were very young and I stumbled onto their involvement. Generational Ritual Abuse is a good clue. I was then harassed, death threatened, stalked by professionals(i.e. not run of the mill bikers or something). Safety box breakins and gas lighting. These are the tactics used to break you and what's worse, make most other people believe you're bat shit crazy. My children were taken to Europe and my career was destroyed. More to add and it ain't my intention to scare anyone (hell I am here) but targeting exists. Simply put, MSM has targeted Pizzagate(smear tactics, Saul Alinsky playbook crap, Ad Homenim attacks). This stuff regarding child trafficking though, is the biggest kept secret and it is true!! I will die to get the word out. I will die trying anyway, ha!

             Man I am truly sorry to hear. It will take many years before DID/MK Ultra connections are confirmed to the general public. There are a few psychotherapists brave enough to discuss.  If there is anything we can do let is know. More voices are always better. Karma will win in the end I promise you

            Podesta and HRC are next. It's better to concentrate on them one by one. If we don't, we lose track of threads, evidence and we tend to forget very important details that are crucial in any important investigation.

            Of course that's how he comes off. He's a narcissistic at the very least. More likely Anti-social personality disorder (socio-psychopath). People like this have no idea how to act "normal" they aren't built that way.

            Comment from original deleted post regarding the many 'leave JA alone comments :
           </p>
           <p>
            I was expecting someone to say something similar, but what prompted me to post was that video from a voat investigator who apparently was personally threatened on the phone by alefantis himself.
It reeks of shit that an investigator, advanced enough to be posting youtube videos and selling PG merchandise, wouldn't record even one of the many calls he says he took from alefantis. It just boggles the mind. On a forum of archive archive archive.
           </p>
           <p>
            Also on YouTube he says alefantis threatened to kill him, without any evidence, while associating himself with VOAT. If this is false then alefantis can claim libel or whatever from the video and discredit the whole forum.
           </p>
           <p>
            Edit: he also said that alefantis is on Voat. Hi James, I'm not going to threaten you with anything but karma. If you did any of the alleged then you will get what you deserve

            I agree. I agree that James isn't a big fish. But he is a fish. I think we need to continue what we're doing which is focus on all angles. Sure we can agree we wish the leads would move more toward podesta but the fact is James is just so easy to figure out like like too much a bragger to keep quiet type thing. If podesta had the personality of James it would lead his way more. BUT we shouldn't not focus on valid info or focus more on one person. We should continue to focus on what seems most productive. Let's not tell people where to look unless it's clearly unrelated and a waste of time.

             not a "big fish", but via his POSITION in the operation, def a "kingpin" and I think that realization has finally DAWNED ON HIM.

             David Brock just the other day alluded to J Achilles Alefantis and John Podesta being in a "relationship" as such - exact word Brock, Alefantis's former lover, used. He would know then, wouldn't he?

            Why do some think JA is in the CIA? Isn't the CIA supposed to be someone who spies? Are people thinking he's not bad and just watching everyone around him be bad so they can arrest these people in the future. No way. Can someone explain why they would think he's in the CIA?

             There are mountains of evidence suggesting that the CIA is a secret society organization full of eugenicists and powerful ruling class players. Their proper role in our society should be considered and investigated before attempting to comprehend what level these people operate at and how the operate. Jan Irvin,

             There are spies in the CIA, but they are mostly in foreign countries - the CIA has many other operations and activities. People do not think that Alefantis is a good guy working for the government doing surveillance on pedophiles - that would be the FBI's job. They think he is in the CIA because of the MKUltra (officially confirmed) and MONARCH (not officially confirmed) programs, and because of suspicions that the CIA is involved in international human trafficking and blackmail of politicians using pedophilia.

             MKUltra is a mind-control program originating in the CIA in, I believe, the early 1950s. They experimented with drugs, hypnosis, and other techniques to get people to tell the truth, not tell the truth, carry out missions without remembering what they had done or why, and other things. Monarch is said to have sprung from this, and it allegedly involves traumatizing young children with sex and torture to induce multiple-personality or dissociative-identity disorder. The goal is to create a mind-controlled slave that has a highly compartmentalized mind. Information gathered about Monarch is mostly based on the testimonies of those who claim to be its victims (namely Cathy O'Brien and Paul Bonacci)
            </p>
            <p>
             There is a lot of information available about this in books and online. One of the best books about MKUltra is The Search for the "Manchurian Candidate" by John Marks. The Finders case is also very significant.

              I heard on the news today a few times that the Fort Laud. shooter told the FBI in Alaska a yr ago that an Intelligence Agency was telling him to watch ISIS videos. Why are these things not checked out? This sound like MK Ultra to me. I also believe that JA is under CIA MK Ultra control.

                The fact that it was on the local news was shocking. We saw it on two stations and now I hope I will be equally shocked to find that they will be running a full investigation. We should not allow them to sweep this under the rug.

               I don't think there's a consensus at this point about JA's exact background, just a general feeling that he is involved based in the limited information we have now.

they  don't let just  any  dummy speak  to  the  world in public  interviews unless he is a  master  of  deception, in  speech,  content, and body posture-this  guy  is speaking  for  the  BIG  BOYS, and there are sever penalties  for  failing in  your  mission,  which  in  his  case  is  to look  like  some (strange) poor pizza  guy,  who has  been  caught  up  in  some childish  (p.t.p.)  internet  prank  gone  wrong...

               Right. Definitely not one of the architects. Completely agreed on Alefuckle being one of 'theirs.' He's no bottom-feeder minion. You don't get to 49th position for nothing... but, very realistically now representing part of this and easily distanced from the elite if need be.

             They lost the election, the whitehouse, the congress, the senate, the scotus, I imagine the fate of Alefantis is not a huge priority, they will just kill him if he they think he will spill.

              He can't spill. They'll kill all his relatives. But he's very likely to die anyway, b/c that's how they tie up loose ends now, idinit?

              I would say either or both Podestas are on that list as well - they were the "cause" of it. They'd kill Jesus again, if they believed that would protect the dark high brain-rotting bitch-witch Hillary.

               He won't die until after the heat is off of him.  You can't kill someone without raising red flags amidst all of this.  There is also a chance that the shooter at CPP (who was an actor) was someone sent there to scare him into keeping his mouth shut.

               I have to think with Trump coming into office, the fact we keep finding all this stuff, they are going to have another game plan.  After HRC loss they have to be scrambling consider they want to start WW3.

               I'd say that Hill did herself in, she knew having a personal server was wrong and unsecured and was subject to hacking, but she did it anyway. and yes, that doesn't stop her from blaming everyone anyone else. I will not be surprised if we find out that Putin frequently dined with her and Bill at the Chappaqua home. Hopefully the kuru will take her down soon.

                The point it was subject to hacking was the whole purpose of the server. That's how she sampled and sold the f35 to the chinese, through her little cadre of 5 chinese hacker friends she sends Chelsea to china to coordinate with.

            I would not doubt it if Alefantis is a 'lifer' MKUltra slave with the likes of Brock Pierce and such. After the 60's, it seems MKUltra was 'sold' to other governments and NGO's as technology. Operation 'Paperclip' was rather plentiful. Alefuckis does display certain characteristics of a split lifer; authoritarian dependence, life long character development in alter-ego, etc. I'm still having trouble with all of the 33's strewn about in this topic... smells of the temple in the east.

             I'm going to go a step further. Not only is Alefantis CIA, so are the Podestas and the Clintons. I'm surprised so many people cannot see this for what it is: A generational intelligence psy ops designed to give CIA ( elite controlled ) complete dominion over the government of the United States. Let me know if you want to chat off board about your conclusions. I would appreciate hearing them.

              I have a good eye and ear for connecting things and smelling BS. I wanted to say podesta is a pawn too but he was secretary for state ffs. If that position is a pawn position  then the true enemy is very powerful. This means that we can't win if even our governments and courts are compromised. On what forum do we judge them then if courts can't be trusted. Vigilantism rarely succeeds

              Absolutely. This is what I also believe. JA was a victim of MK Ultra as a child sadly. He has been groomed since childhood to be CIA aka Illuminati/globalist minded. These people have infiltrated every level of society by now. They are everywhere. It's fucking sad. The whole psychological warfare began with Aquino who is still around dictating today.

               Not enough said about Aquino. Huge part in this with Satanism basically being a parallel ideology with the military -- of which this guy being solely responsible for (of course, built on the backs of Crowley, etc) the introduction and adoption into the military. Unfortunately, every time we speak of these bigger players (like Epstein), in relation to connections with pizzagate, it seems too far a stretch for some. Makes perfect sense to me... the connections and relevance to pizzagate, that is.

             Good point. I actually repeated the 33 figure but Wikipedia said 40 children. It's interesting imo

            If you want more information on Podesta, take the lead and start researching yourself. I have stuck with the Alefantis 'area' of things on the whole because that part interests me, the human behaviour, links etc. If we all upped sticks and only focused on one thing, we'd miss a lot of other things.

             I agree. I'm just worried the latest developments could compromise the investigation.  I believe this is global and I am focusing on connecting the US operation to Europe where I'm based and felt I had to warn the community.

              You will do well to look at George Webb on facebook he has such a good easily understood compilation of all the spiders web related in many parts to trafficking but not exclusive, it also shows connections to oil, pipeline, everything clinton/podesta/laurasilsby/monica peterson (killed looking into clinton child trafficking in Haiti) wars/money etc. the Where is Eric Braverman series hes still continuing daily. EXCELLENT

            Unfortunately there are only so many of us, we are not getting paid (well, I'm not), we fiend off shills  and many of the people here are very fixated on pegasus or the basement or alefantis's creepy friends (with good reason). Please recruit  your friends to help if you can. These subjects you mention are well hashed already if you search the older threads, have you tried that? Also check in the deleted threads.   I posted threads about Podesta's children and cousins so look for those as well. They lead to weirdness in Winchester VA and probable adoption related child trafficking by Podesta cousin Patti Paule-Carres et al.

             I agree totally. I posted the references because the mods deleted my post.

            <p>
             I am aware of much research in the Podestas and hilary and I endorse and support much of it.

             What I am trying to point out here is the fact that alefantis could be a
             <em>
              false
             </em>
             flag and the latest phonecall/ voat connections reek of bullshit
