            I don't think we should expect the LAPD to be helpful in anything, unless they are pressured to do something by public outcry.  This is the same organization that has been turning a blind eye to Hollywood, and helping to cover up things, for over a 100 years. The decision makers in the organization are political creatures. For example, if some studio bigwig is molesting children, all he has to do is "contribute" to some politician (D.A, council member, mayor, ...) or share the vice with the politician, and that politician is going to exert pressure on the higher ups in the police force to turn the other way. The higher ups want to keep their positions, so will play ball.  I am familiar with city politics, and it is as much as cesspool as Hollywood.

            'The group has attracted around 16,000 members over the last 20 years, and while it labels its courses as ones that are “designed to bring about greater self-fulfillment by eliminating psychological and emotional barriers,” one former member described the horrific, scarring, initiation process.'
           </p>
           <p>
            'Sarah Edmondson said she was among five women who were told to undress and lay down on a table where other members restrained their arms and legs. They were instructed to say, “Master, please brand me, it would be an honor,” before a doctor used a cauterizing device to “sear a two-inch-square symbol below each woman’s hip.”
           </p>
           <p>
            'While the report claimed that “several former members have asked state authorities to investigate the group’s practices, it noted that officials have declined to pursue action. In the case of Edmondson, she told the Times that she tried to file a complaint with the New York State Department of Health against Danielle Roberts, a licensed osteopath who performed the branding. However, she was told that the agency would not look into it because Roberts was not “acting as Ms. Edmondson’s doctor when the branding is said to have happened.”
           </p>
           <p>
            'Complaints against Dr. Brandon Porter, a physician who reportedly forced certain NXIVM members to watch violent videos of “four women being murdered and dismembered” were also ignored by state medical regulators who claimed that the allegations against Porter “did not meet the agency’s definition of ‘medical misconduct.’"
           </p>
           <p>
            'The latest attempt at legal support in exposing the group has come from former Dynasty actress Catherine Oxenberg, who met with prosecutors in the office of NY Attorney General Eric Schneiderman and “presented evidence that her daughter India is being blackmailed by a cult leader.”
           </p>
           <p>
            'While it remains to be seen whether investigators will take Catherine Oxenberg’s claims seriously, and if she will be able to save her daughter from the ruthless cult, one thing is certain—the police have ignored and downplayed the severity of NXIVM’s influence on thousands of vulnerable women across the country.'
           </p>
           <hr/>
           <p>
            It's unbelievable authorities have refused to investigate this cult.
