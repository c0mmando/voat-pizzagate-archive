<p>ALERT: A very large wildfire has broken out next to the Hanford Washington Nuclear Waste and reactor test site - west of the LIGO gravity wave sensor station it would appear </p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hanford_Site">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hanford_Site</a> </p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Hanford Site is a decommissioned nuclear production complex operated by the United States federal government on the Columbia River in Benton County in the U.S. state of Washington. The site has been known by many names, including Hanford Project, Hanford Works, Hanford Engineer Works and Hanford Nuclear Reservation. Established in 1943 as part of the Manhattan Project in Hanford, south-central Washington, the site was home to the B Reactor, the first full-scale plutonium production reactor in the world.[1] Plutonium manufactured at the site was used in the first nuclear bomb, tested at the Trinity site, and in Fat Man, the bomb detonated over Nagasaki, Japan. </p>
<p>During the Cold War, the project expanded to include nine nuclear reactors and five large plutonium processing complexes, which produced plutonium for most of the more than 60,000 weapons built for the U.S. nuclear arsenal.[2][3] Nuclear technology developed rapidly during this period, and Hanford scientists produced major technological achievements. </p>
<p>In 2007, the Hanford site represented 60% of high-level radioactive waste by volume managed by the US Department of Energy[7] and 7-9% of all nuclear waste in the United States (the DOE manages 15% of nuclear waste in the US, with the remaining 85% being commercial spent nuclear fuel). ..On November 10, 2015, it was designated as part of the Manhattan Project National Historical Park alongside other sites in Oak Ridge and Los Alamos.</p>

<p>..Stemcor is a Steel company owned by the Oppenheimer family that includes both a guest at the villa where Madeleine went missing and a UK MP accused of covering up child sex scandals. Steel is used for pipelines. Viktor Pinchuk is a major Clinton Foundation Donor. Pinchuk made pipeline deals with Iran under Hillary\'s watch. Stemcor owns Chiatura, which mines manganese.

<p>Okay, so another Oppenheimer is Lisa Oppenheimer who is a Director at Bright Horizons. She also used to write for the Disney magazine. She is married to Steve Chilinski ..</p>

Perkin , the founder of Program for Appropriate Technology in Health.  .. He was also involved with Oak Ridge .. which is connected with Los Alamos National Laboratory </p>
<p>Los Alamos National Laboratory (Los Alamos or LANL for short) is a United States Department of Energy national laboratory initially organized during World War II for the design of nuclear weapons as part of the Manhattan Project. It is located a short distance northwest of Santa Fe, New Mexico in the southwestern United States.
Los Alamos was selected as the top secret location for bomb design in late 1942, and officially commissioned the next year. At the time it was known as Project Y, one of a series of laboratories located across the United States given letter names to maintain their secrecy. Los Alamos was the center for design and overall coordination, while the other labs, today known as Oak Ridge and Hanford, concentrated on the production of uranium and plutonium bomb fuels. Los Alamos was the heart of the project, collecting together some of the world\'s most famous scientists, among them numerous Nobel Prize winners. The site was known variously as Project Y, Los Alamos Laboratory, and Los Alamos Scientific Laboratory through this period.</p>

             Digging Into The History Of Hanford's Radioactive Waste Tunnels
            </a>
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             One week ago workers found a tunnel filled with radioactive waste caved in at the Hanford nuclear site in southeast Washington. State officials and tribes are calling for quick cleanup action...
            </p>
            <p>
             Historian Michele Gerber wrote a 64-page report on the history of the PUREX plant 24 years ago. PUREX is short for the Plutonium Uranium Extraction Plant. And now, its tunnels are infamous since the cave-in was discovered. The plant was built from 1953 to 1955 and opened “hot” in January 1956.  “It was President Eisenhower’s most important project,” Gerber said. “When he was elected he called it Project X. And this project was literally number one in his priorities was to increase nuclear weapons production for a program that he called ‘Massive Retaliation.’”
            </p>
            <p>
             ..The PUREX plant is longer than three football fields. It stands 64 feet above the ground, and goes another 40 feet below ground. Its job was to concentrate as much plutonium as possible from irradiated rods coming out of Hanford’s reactors. It was efficient.

            <p>
             For anyone who hasn't heard of PROMIS, it is software linked to a complex network of domestic and global spying involving every president since the 1980s. A company in Little Rock, Arkansas -- Systematics, Inc. -- is alleged to be behind adapting the PROMIS software to their core banking systems allowing backdoor access to data used to predict changes in the global economy and perhaps even launder money.
            </p>
            <p>
             The company was started by Jackson Stephens -- Bill Clinton's former financier -- and Systematics installed their core banking systems in major financial institutions across the globe throughout three decades. In 1990, the company was bought out by Alltel, changing it's name.
            </p>
            <p>
             The Clintons, Bush Sr., and the CIA are alleged to be deeply involved in many of the crimes said to have been committed through PROMIS. In fact, PROMIS software is linked to facilitating the covert funding of unauthorized intelligence operations.

              Danny Casolaro was found dead in a hotel bathtub at the Sheraton hotel in August 1991 — the official verdict was suicide.
             </p>
             <p>
              At the time of his death, he was investigating a sprawling criminal conspiracy he labelled ‘The Octopus’.
              <strong>
               Casolaro’s starting point for his investigation was a real criminal case — a wide-ranging Washington scandal involving allegations that the US Government had stolen software company Inslaw’s PROMIS program and added illegal back doors in order to spy on foreign governments.
              </strong>
             </p>
             <p>
              Casolaro called his conspiracy ‘Octopus’ for a reason, as he followed the trail from PROMIS to reveal a much larger story, one that encompassed such seemingly disparate events as the October surprise, the collapse of bank BBCI and the illegal drugs and arms trade — all orchestrated by a secret cabal of global elites.

            , what's the thesis here? At the moment, this is just a 6-degrees of separation laundry list with nothing pulling it together to show relevance to the abuse of kids by the global elite or an Epstein pedo blackmail brownstone operation. Please spell out a possible connection. I'll give you the 24 Hour grace flair. Thanks!

              Lets break it down real quick like this 1. The official story is full blown 4am mocking bird talking points across all MSM news mediums 2. No one shuts down a facility for like that for a Janitor watching porn on WIFI that's some serious shill news 3. Honeywell/Sandia has always had ties to the deep state and Mossad 4. They were using the site for a lot more than looking at the sun 5. Blackhawk Helicopters were heard on the initial night of the raid which suggests US Marines raided it at the orders of Q team 6. Future proves past
