<h1>The &quot;Official&quot; Story</h1>
<p>In 2009, DynCorp contractors paid a 17-year-old Afghan Bacha Bazi performer to entertain them in Kunduz. Several Afghans were later arrested and investigated. It would be officially reported that the boy was dressed in jeans and a t-shirt and performed a &quot;tribal dance&quot; and <strong>no DynCorp employee would be prosecuted.</strong></p>
<h1>Hillary Clinton and the story\'s cover-up</h1>
<p>This 2009 email from Hillary Clinton\'s archive mentions DynCorp\'s hiring of an “adolescent boy dancer” from Afghanistan “for some sort of event that, at least to most folks, looked very inappropriate.” Here is the direct quote:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>According to my reporting, the week of April 13th, the DynCorp regional commander from Konduz, Flint Chambers, allowed his men to hire a 15-year-old boy dancer to do tribal dances at a DynCorp party on the training site. </p>
<p>Some 15 or so DynCorp employees in attendance pulled out a single chair and had the boy do mock lap dances. This was captured on video. </p>
<p>The video shows DynCorp employees putting dollar bills in the boy’s waistband, just as they would a stripper’s garter. The revelry lasted about 45 minutes.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This message was sent directly to Hillary Clinton from Cheryl Mills who is one of her most prominent lawyers (she also defended Bill Clinton from impeachment). Based on the email, it appears The Washington Post was writing to Hillary Clinton and her team about an upcoming article on the DynCorp Afghanistan scandal, and it appears Mills and the rest of the team then engaged in damage control to hush parts of that upcoming article.</p>
<p>In the Hillary Clinton emails there is another about “inappropriate behavior by department contractor” which also took place in Afghanistan on April 16th, 2009, the circumstances of which are unclear but may refer to a contractor\'s drug overdose mentioned in the Afghan boy email: <a href="https://wikileaks.org/clinton-emails/emailid/15562">WikiLeaks</a></p>
<h1>WikiLeaks cable reveals important clues on the real events</h1>
<p>The Afghan Minister of Interior, Hanif Atmar, was mentioned in a United States diplomatic cable to the State Department asking vehemently that the story of the dancing boy be silenced:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Atmar reiterated his insistence that the U.S. try to quash any news article on the incident or circulation of a video connected with it. </p>
<p>He continued to predict that publicity would &quot;endanger lives.&quot; </p>
<p>He disclosed that he has arrested two Afghan police and nine other Afghans as part of an MoI investigation into Afghans who facilitated this crime of &quot;purchasing a service from a child.&quot;</p>
<p>He was convinced that the Kunduz incident, and other events where mentors had obtained drugs, could not have happened without Afghan participation. </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>The details are horrifying... Apparently, US diplomats told him not to worry, and the eventual story was in fact watered down greatly (until now, of course) calling the whole thing a &quot;tribal dance,&quot; rather than a party where young boys wear &quot;scanty women\'s clothes&quot; and &quot;dance seductively&quot; before being &quot;auctioned off to the highest bidder&quot; for sex.</p>
