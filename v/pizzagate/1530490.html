<p>To properly investigate, you might have to contact people directly, relatives, offices...Don\'t hurt yourself : stay anonymous, create social network profile, use a vpn. (It\'s 40 or 50$ a year and provides you to be too much noticed.) Don\'t forget to archive everything you find online to the web.archive.org, documentation tends to disappear fast lately...Download, capture images. Record mp3 of conversations, or film if you can.
