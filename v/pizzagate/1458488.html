<p>&quot;Ok so this story is anecdotal but I can vouch on source as 100% telling the truth.  Sauce is my family member who has never heard of pizza gate but lives in DC. I asked about Comet Pizza because we went there when I\'ve visited. She immediately knew about allegations of pedo against James Alefantis and told me locals were banding together to defend the local beloved pizza joint. I asked if she knew James, no, but she had a friend. 
Carole Greenwood was that friend. A local famous for cooking for her neighbors parties. So some of them decided to pool money and invest in a restaurant for her to run. She ends up becoming business partners with James Afelantis. She was head chef for both comet and bucks fishing camping. Until…

Then the vague \'urgent family matters\' happens and she leaves DC for 3 years. 
It turns out that Carole\'s son, who is +/-18 at this time, is also working at the restaurant. I think his name is Dylan/Dillon. He grew up without a father and turned to James Alefantis often for advice. 
One night Carole walked into the comet pizza kitchen, and saw James Alefantis fucking her son in the kitchen. She was furious because she immediately knew how completely James had taken advantage of her son. She quit immediately and denounced James viciously in private, unwilling to do so publicly for professional reasons. 
After telling me this my source told me she had never connected that to him being a pedo. After that story she never went back because whenever she ran into him she could tell something was wrong with him. She says she completely believes he\'s a pedo now, and she\'s seriously the least judging person I\'ve ever met. 
So take that as an anecdote against James character and sanitation practices I guess? I\'ve been lurking for awhile but I knew when I actually got a 3 degrees of separation story to the guy I had to put it out there.&quot;</p>

             if he was "fucking" a supposed friend son when they were splitting up form their partner.they are in a vulnerable position looking for guidance it shows about his character. doesn't matter if they were 18  but the OP  of the info suggests that it could of been younger. why shut down other avenues of possibility.

               "psychic"not an argument, don't be facetious. what is the reasoning she left then "temperament" issues fits well with this scenario. if she does she have a son then following up would be   crucial to look into.

             Agree, if anyone is good at outreach to follow up on this could be important. It would be a delicate situation though, if it happened its not the sort of thing they would want to talk about. it surely would be an indictment on James alefantis character though, as the media is pushing a squeaky clean image
