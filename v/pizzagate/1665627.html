<p>A citizen investigator on &quot;godlikeproductions&quot; established a connection with him and &quot;The Smile Of A Child&quot; children\'s Charity.</p>

<p>From the post:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Katsiantonis has connections to the Children\'s Charity, The Smile Of A Child.  The President of “The Smile of the Child”, Costas Yannopoulos and the Head of International Cooperation of the Greek organization, Ambassador Marc Van den Reeck, were invited to present the actions of “The Smile of the Child” to the Board of Directors of the World Hellenic Inter-Parliamentary Association taking place in Athens in the framework of an official visit of the delegation to Greece.</p>
<p>The parliamentarians of Greek descent, headed by President Thomas Katsiantonis, State Representative of New Hampshire, USA showed particular interest in the direct work of the Organization, 52.200 children and their families having been supported in the first semester of 2016 alone through nationwide actions on a 24/7 basis and 365 days/year.  The World Hellenic Inter-Parliamentary Association is a non partisan political association which was founded in August 1996, the same year that “The Smile of the Child” was also founded.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Katsiantonis seems to show interest in organ harvesting as well:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Katsiantonis seems to also have an interest in the growing of human organs.  Katsiantonis voted in favor of ridding an old police station in Manchester, New Hampshire, in order to allow some companies to move into the area, which were allowed and operated by Entrepreneur Dean Kamen in order to initiate Research efforts into growing human organs and tissue, right where the old Police station used to be.   The operation costed an estimated $300 Million and this is done in Manchester on an “industrial scale.”</p>

            This guy was just picked up in the New Hampshire pedo sting. I keep posting it on these threads, yet the op's keep ignoring it, while it's in the 'pizzagate' forum.

             That's a lie.  He wasn't arrested at all, nor has anyone other than Pizzagate researchers even hinted his investigation is related to pedophilia at all.  At this time he has only been found to be a tax evader, but investigation is still open.  Here's the most recent article released today on the topic:
