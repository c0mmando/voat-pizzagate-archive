<p>As any serious student of 9/11 is aware, a group of Austrian \'art students\' known as Gelitin occupied the two floors in the North Tower at the point where a plane (supposedly) hit, with one of their exhibits involving a maze of cardboard boxes that were labeled with a product code for bomb fuses, as well as the removal of ceiling panels and windows and the building of scaffolding outside them for no apparent reason. Their main exhibit was \'supposed\' to be on 9/11, but the event \'interrupted\' it. </p>
<p>I don\'t necessarily endorse all this channel\'s content, but <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CxU_xAakxRQ">this video</a> provides some background on the group. Some of Gelitin\'s other non-WTC \'art\' includes live exhibitions of burning candles stuck in anuses, fecalphelia (i.e. playing with and eating human excrement), and group gay fellatio-while-vomiting.</p>
<p>I saw that Leo Koenig was the \'presenter\' for the group and looked through his Instagram page, which includes a <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/BQDklywBnsr/?taken-by=leokoenigart&amp;hl=en">picture</a> of a wooden carving of a man having sex with a baby (it\'s abstract, but definitely NSFW), reminiscent of Kim Noble\'s crude depictions of same. There are what appear to be cryptic references to a pedophile art scene in the comments.</p>
<p>Here is an Alefantis-esque <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/BJsc5p1hZSE/?taken-by=leokoenigart&amp;hl=en">picture</a> of Koenig \'hanging out\' with a baby at a farm in the Catskills who does not appear to be his daughter. Of course it\'s possible it\'s a relative/innocuous relationship, but it is strange given the above statue and that there are some similar images on accounts of friends.</p>
<p>There are multiple photos of barns and farm houses in the Catskills on Koenig\'s account with cryptic comments posted on them: <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/BL7grtzh6ws/">link</a> (\'something tells me we might use this one quite a bit\'   \'What about the plans for ...?\')</p>
<p>Could this be related to a new Comet-like pedo ring in the Andes NY and Bovina NY area, one that links back to NYC art galleries? Of course, the baby photo and upstate NY connection could be nothing, but in any case, there are enough red flags that he and his network certainly bear looking into. Among his associates there seem to be a lot of pictures of babies by themselves (not pornographic, but some are NSFW): <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/19fcphPD86/?taken-by=sabina_schreder">link</a>. Girl in highly suggestive pose: <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/0a151VvD4q/?taken-by=sabina_schreder">link</a>. Some odd pictures like this: <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/BEeSE3rPDxa/?taken-by=sabina_schreder">link</a>  <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/yfxRUcvD_4/?taken-by=sabina_schreder">link</a> <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/w-ZWZvvD8O/?taken-by=sabina_schreder">link</a> <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/vwhazdPD9L/?taken-by=sabina_schreder">link</a> <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/vyPtaCPD86/?taken-by=sabina_schreder">link</a> <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/0a151VvD4q/?taken-by=sabina_schreder">link</a> (there were several others) </p>

            I don't know anything about the whole 9/11 part of this but that Austrian "art student" or who ever he is, apparently is a fan of an photographer called Sergey Bratkov.  He's the one who took the pic of the girl with the lollypop

           <p>

            single portraits with no nudity but someone should arrest this guy ....or at least investigate him and his contacts.

           <p>
            As per the comments in the link you posted, he is also a fan of  Leo Koenig who gets up to some weird stuff:   "Gallerist Leo Koenig invited Renner to host a six-day feast called Hardcore Diner"  Reminiscent to the spirit cooking type parties these people seem to enjoy.

            The art students were there just for cover. If you fell for that BS then you haven't done your research. The real riggers were Michael Calibresi and US deep state black ops according to Wayne Maddison. The art students aside from providing cover built a platform inside the boxes so they could push a silicon dummy out the window at 6.00 am one Sunday morning - to get the "falling man" shot. 9/11 towers demo used a fussion nuke fireball + other mini nukes in the basement. The fussion nuke was too sophisticated to have been an outside of the US perpetrator.

             I didn't 'fall for that BS.' I am well aware that the towers appear to have destroyed by mini-nukes and art students/Israeli movers were the last resort fall guys if Saudi Arabia ever got fingered (which may be close to happening) but then exposed as fall guys themselves, in order that the domestic culprits would never go down. They are still closely linked to 9/11.

            There is definitely some sick stuff going on here. They're clearly pedophiles, but there are countless pedophiles out there. However, the identity of this person and his connection to deep state/rogue intel makes him noteworthy when he otherwise might not particularly be (relative to the others in question here). What I meant by that is that I'm not sure it's a major ring, but I think there are several indications above that it may be.

            I'm not 'in for the upvotes.' I just don't want posts I take considerable time to research and write to get buried by unobservant, lazy idiots like you who don't even bother to read the whole post and view the evidence before downvoting.

            Use your imagination. It's a tiny figure with a head and four limbs, and the man is clearly in pleasure, and is holding the figure by the hips. The actual art dealer who sold it, an expert in the field, refers to there being sex that is taking place, as quoted in the comments.
