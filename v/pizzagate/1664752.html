<p>A new start-up company called Authenticated Reality is working on creating a new layer of the internet, by allowing users to effectively censor posts and comments they deem &quot;fake.&quot; The users are required to submit their driver\'s license upon registering, so they can be vetted.

<p><strong>How this is related to Pizzagate:</strong>
Loosely related - it shines a light on the ever increasing number of methods that TPTB use to effectively silence the Pizzagate and other possible citizen investigations. Basically one more step towards an Orwellian future.</p>

<p>The company\'s product, which it calls &quot;The New Internet,&quot; is launching in a closed beta this week.

<p>Addressing fake news with a closed network of verified commenters might make the web a more trustworthy place for Authenticated Reality\'s users, but it is a markedly different approach from the recent high-profile efforts in the media and tech world to combat the problem.</p>
<p>One of those efforts is a collaboration between Facebook, Google and major news outlets to verify news coverage of the 2017 French presidential election. Instead of the public verifying the news themselves, they\'ll send suspicious stories, photos and other content to real journalists who will use an arsenal of analytics tools to validate them.</p>

            Smells like a new service for PEDOS or the silencing of future investigators.

            The massive censorship of social media has already backfired with lots of people. Every time I have brought up how messed up it is that Twitter, Facebook, YouTube, etc. are censoring people because they don't agree with them I've been met by a room full of nodding heads.
