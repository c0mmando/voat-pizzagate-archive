<p>The company\'s product, which it calls &quot;The New Internet,&quot; is launching in a closed beta this week. It\'s essentially a sandboxed layer that lives on top of every webpage its users visit, allowing them to authenticate stories they believe are real by placing their digital signature on them for other users to see.</p>
<p>To weed out people who themselves might be inclined to write fake news or incendiary comments, Authenticated Reality has come up with a verification system that requires users to submit their driver\'s license information to prove that they are who they say they are.</p>
<p>Addressing fake news with a closed network of verified commenters might make the web a more trustworthy place for Authenticated Reality\'s users, but it is a markedly different approach from the recent high-profile efforts in the media and tech world to combat the problem.</p>
<p>One of those efforts is a collaboration between Facebook, Google and major news outlets to verify news coverage of the 2017 French presidential election. Instead of the public verifying the news themselves, they\'ll send suspicious stories, photos and other content to real journalists who will use an arsenal of analytics tools to validate them.</p>

            The massive censorship of social media has already backfired with lots of people. Every time I have brought up how messed up it is that Twitter, Facebook, YouTube, etc. are censoring people because they don't agree with them I've been met by a room full of nodding heads.
