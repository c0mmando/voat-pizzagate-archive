<p>That\'s okay. <strong>We need you.</strong></p>
<p>Not everyone involved needs to research, dig, create memes/videos/content, etc.</p>
<p>There are plenty of people that are dedicating a tremendous amount of time on these activities. You know who you are and THANK YOU.</p>
<p>Where YOU can help is distribution and marketing. In other words, relentlessly spreading the message online - anonymously!</p>
<p>I was once a &quot;lurker&quot;... and now, having contributed, it feels great. I am no longer standing by, just letting this evil continue to happen. </p>
<p>Knowing what is going on, and not doing anything about it is a <strong>terrible feeling</strong>...</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Here\'s How YOU Can Help:</strong></p>
<p>Create &quot;anonymous&quot; accounts and distribute the content that you feel is most damning and convincing.</p>
<p>Sign up to one or many accounts, whatever you\'re most comfortable with:</p>
<ul>
<li>Twitter</li>
<li>Google (YouTube)</li>
<li>Facebook</li>
<li>Tumblr </li>
<li>Disqus</li>
<li>Reddit </li>
<li>Instagram </li>
<li>Pinterest</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<p>Share content daily with 1 to 3 <strong>Trending Hashtags</strong> and/or <strong>Topics</strong> in each post.</p>
<p><strong>Twitter Example:</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://s24.postimg.org/cca8nnqp1/IMG_1616.jpg">https://s24.postimg.org/cca8nnqp1/IMG_1616.jpg</a></p>

<p><strong>Top Instagram Hashtags:</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://top-hashtags.com/instagram/">https://top-hashtags.com/instagram/</a></p>
<p><em>Be sure to use #hashtags / topics that are trending at the time of your posts to get the most visibility.</em></p>
<hr />
<p>It takes less than an hour a day to share 10-15 solid posts. </p>
<p>You can even make a list your top 10 convincing posts / memes or links and post them everyday with different hashtags.</p>

           Second, you can hunt for shills and people/organizations on social media channels, and boards (Voat, steemit, Reddit, 4chan, etc.) and post comments to their posts/tweets or news articles with content from your top 10 list.
          </p>
          <p>
           It's easy, for example search "fake news pizza" on any social media channel and/or search engine.

            I've been saying it's a numbers game at this point.  If there were 500,000 active posters all over the world in one day imagine the impact it could have on his.  The once hunters will realize the fear that they have instilled in their innocent victims.

            Another good thing to do is simply use the search tool and read, read, read what has been put here in the past.  I have found that our collective memory bank is a valuable asset, and can provide shortcuts to those who have good questions that may have already been researched with leads.

            Been following the subject for some years and never moreso than over the last few months almost to the point of obsession.  I consider myself fortunate to have stumbled across Yoichi Shimatsu early on Which has enabled me a fantastic understanding of the length and breadth of this subject and indeed, with little exception I find much coming to the fore even now was already touched upon in those essays.  So, eventually and More recently I got into and have been lurking much in Voat!!  I have have had to learn how it works (and still am learning) and  upvoating where I can.  I'm intelligent with an analytical brain but technologically somewhat inept which means I have to hold most info inside my head as I have no experience of archiving or cross referencing.  This can be frustrating when I know I have read something before (and I have read much) that I know is relevant to the post I'm currently reading, but without an archive or 'filing system' (old school bird) I am unable to make what may be a valuable link and contribution - and you're all fiercely rule led so I've learned there's a whole heap of meg that follows an improperly substantiated suggestion that newbies like me fear falling victim to and looking like the complete amateur.  In other words, and consequently, This is thence frustrating in that I'm equipped with much information but unable to collate it in a useful fashion to be of help and thus I am limited to word of mouth and supporting in other social media platforms where I can.  However, again please understand that the fear of identity even in these forums can prevent us speaking as loudly as we want to (I want to shout it from the rooftops tbh and do when I can) but the our faith in this being truth is not held by others within our social circles and beyond (hence the need for the publicity in the first place), and for some, the fear of blowback and ostracisation is higher than you experienced more ballsy posters may appreciate.  In that light, I'm interested in the forging of anonymous accounts but again, not experienced enough to know how to go about this to ensure real anonymity so would appreciate help in that regard and also I. Terms of how
To archive for future reference. Sorry to come across like a dim bulb for I assure you I am not, just limited in techno ability!!  A further frustration is that being UK based, my input in US based polls or surveys or petitions is rendered useless.  I wish we had a UK Based Voat where I could possiby be a more confident and active participant.  As a final note, I have to say that when talking about the US issues I have impressed others and  even Americans with my in-depth knowledge of names,  activities, function and strategies of the maze of departments and organisations within the US political structure.  Now if knowledge is power, I d appreciate some help with how I may better use mine for the cause.  I know that this is massively linked to the UK so your cause is my cause.  Teach me?

            ! Can I humbly request that you add my article to your "top content" list? It has been in the Voat PG "Getting up to speed" sticky since the beginning, and I have consistently heard that it is THE most skeptic-friendly resource out there, ideal for converting newbies and people who have discounted the whole thing without really looking into it. We have a whole series, but this is the first one that starts from the beginning:

One thing that I am seeing a lot of recently is people who are under-informed or mis-informed unwittingly (yet honestly) spreading or championing bad information. With such high volumes of disinformation flying about this is very easy to do. But, every single person who is diligent about making sure they have enough info to be able to come to an accurate conclusion is just one more mighty mighty ally of the truth. And we can use every single one of those we can get.

            Just adding my two cents, there are a few really good podcasts that go over the basics that really helped to get me on board. 
-The JRE episode with Alex Jones can get a little exhausting but it is very good

            I was a lurker for months starting on Reddit then moved here to voat after the thread got taken down. Just made an account about a week ago. I know I won't be much help comping new info but I will definitely show support by continuing to doing the things this post stated! Everyone is doing a seriously amazing job I can't believe all the information and dedication you all have contributed.

            I'm mostly a lurker, but also a lawyer.  I have helped out a few times with accessing PACER to get federal court documents for people (e.g. Epstein cases, Edgar M. Welch shooter case, et al.).
           </p>
           <p>
            My practice has absolutely ZERO to do with criminal law, but if you need court access shoot me a message.
           </p>
           <p>
            P.S. I'm not a fed, or a shill, or CTR, or a closet pedo, or any other epithet thrown around.  Just trying to help the cause.

            What an awesome post here, thanks for putting all this together FoxMcCloud11! People want to help but often don't know what to do, that why I made the Pizzagate For Dummies eBook for them to share. You can even print it and leave at coffeeshops etc...And thanks for sharing that eBook link here too!! (P3 typo fixed now) I may do an update soon and add the Ben Swann clip, flight of the navigator etc. but it will still be at the same link.

            My understanding is quite the opposite. I'm going from memory here but basically what i heard was Trump met the guy/saw what the guy was about then banned him from his building after seeing what he was all about.
           </p>
           <p>
            Trump may not be the guy who "leads" the push to have pizzagate investigated but remember pizzagate all started because of FBIAnon and FBIAnon said there's an internal war going on and from what Trump has said, even recently, he seems, at the very least, the type of person to looking at many things that a lot of powerful people generally don't want people looking at.
           </p>
           <p>
            Regardless my point still remains. It'll go no where if people aren't constantly applying pressure. Especially AFTER January 20.

            Email addresses aren't require to post here... so you should be fine. You also use "throwaway" email address - search google for "temporary email account" or "anonymous email" and many options will be available to you.
           </p>
           <p>
            A search on Google "how to stay anonymous on the internet" will point you in the right direction.

            I'm a lurker and I've posted some Pizzagate stuff on my twitter which doesn't have my full name.  I'm also a childhood abuse survivor &amp; what I read in the Podesta emails is absolutely a code.  I saw enough smoke to convince me of the presence of fire.  It was at that time I became convinced that stopping HRC was the most important thing that had to happen, it also brought a lot of feelings back and sent me into a dark place.  About a week later to my overwhelming relief, Trump won the election.  I hope he listens to the people and everything comes out.

            Ok; you've convinced me. I have been a chronic lurker for the past months.I am totally computer illiterate, have no idea how to archive a post, have no idea how to embed links.....   But I can say this. I try to inform everyone that I know about this topic. The majority are – – – no, let me say the entirety – – – totally unaware. Some people have never heard the term. Most people are so spiritually unaware, that they have no connection with God – – – which means that they have no awareness of the devil's capacity.   So when you tell them that there is something called SRA (satanic ritual abuse)  they turn their heads and run, because the concept is so foreign to them and seems so obscure and ridiculous. However, I have met several people who have been totally receptive to the concept of pizza gate and how it relates to child trafficking, world government, the election, etc. You have encouraged me to go back to Twitter and anywhere else that I can to try and spread the info. Thanks for the encouragement.

            I had to leave all of the FB groups as I was getting constant pings on my smart phone from the new messages. You see I rely on my FB for getting work and I was starting to lose those messages. Perhaps someone with more technical skill can leave the correct link and an email for those interested to get back if there are questions.

            i"m a member and I joined soon after Pizzagate was 1st formed. I'm not at all tech savvy although I can type well over 80 wpm. So I don't have the ability to figure out what info/links to share. If you to to your FB and Google Pizza or Pizzagate I'm sure you'll find over a dozen small online groups. I'll probably have to delete my membership in all of them very soon as I'm getting constant pings and it's creating havoc with my dozen online groups where I exchange acting gigs.

            Voat is unable to help with forgotten password (see

            ).
           </p>
           <p>
            I recommend getting content ready for when they turn registration back on. It's been disabled for security / spam purposes, but is temporary.
           </p>
           <p>
            Terribly sorry to hear about your experience.. I couldn't imagine. We're extremely happy and proud to have you as a part of this movement.
           </p>
           <p>
            Hold tight, get things prepared (try YouTube for now?) - registrations should be opening soon.

            They were designed with 4chan in mind, but I am blocked from posting.

            As we are currently joining dots, investigation is reaching to all manner of places and people. These may in time, be debunked if deemed irrelevant. Regardless of shills, I believe we have an extremely healthy investigation and media team at the moment. Keep on keeping on guys ; )

              What are the very solid findings?  So far, the only things that I've seen are predicated on the 4chan post being true, and the meaning of the words in emails being pedophile codewords instead of real words for food.

                   Yes, that plays a big role. How about the use of "moloch" in the emails.. there's no code going on there. Code or not, the remaining content is very questionable.

                    The thing about this whole pizza gate is that if the 4chan post is real, then all of this shit is incredibly damning.  The problem is that this is all based on the 4chan post being real.  This is 4chan we're talking about.  Anyone can post literally anything they want to.  What's more the place is known for shitposting.
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    The fact that child molesters use different foods as code words means that I've been implicating myself in a child pornography ring with every text message I send to someone asking where we're going to lunch.  God forbid anyone makes a 4chan post about how I'm running a pedophile organization.
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    As far as sacrificing chickens to Moloch goes, if chickens do in fact mean little boys then yes that is damning.  Or it could mean that the dude is going to cook some chicken (given that Moloch is a babylonian god that was later demonized by the Catholic Church.  Moloch is associated with hell.  Hell = fire.  Chicken + fire = cooked chicken.)  On the other hand if the guy on 4chan isn't trolling then yeah, it's fucking damning.
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    I'm fine with an investigation.  I think one should probably happen at this point if for no other reason than to put this shit to rest.

            Pizzagate is fake news. Give these crackpots another month and they will be back on chem trails, bigfoot, and 9/11. I am glad Mr. Obama is clamping down on fake news.

            I agree with you - but with anything like this, there is always the fringe. The focus needs to be clear. your examples are exactly what we don't need, at least not in this sub. The Salem witch trials comprision isn't very good however, I'm sure there are more modern examples to cite if you want to insult wants happening of late. In any case, I appreciate your feedback and contributions thus far.

            I have been posting links and memes to my Twitter and Instagram....Also, Pinterest. I'd love to help research,  but don't know where to start. The tentacles on this go seemingly everysingle direction and that is mind boggling. I do read every post, and try to keep up with the insane amount of new information you guys uncover and I have Evernote notebooks filled with most of the links and all. I'm not doing alot, but helping in the small way I can.

             Thanks for the feedback. Researching has become much more granular, at least for established leads.
            </p>
            <p>
             You can try and help dig for information for new leads / directions.
            </p>
            <p>
             Pinterest is a great platform for this initiative. I will add to my post.
            </p>
            <p>
             Can you make your Evernote books public or share your archives? That could benefit researchers.
            </p>
            <p>
             We appreciate your help!

              My Evernote notebook isn't anything new AT ALL. It's just links I've collected here on voat that I just copy/paste to keep in one place for myself. I have a hard time remembering where I saw something... This way all linksare  in one place for me. It's just a list of links....Nothing xciting. If I can find the time to open every link and somehow organize them into categories or whatnot I will most definitely share.  I'm so happy to be here, been lurking 2-3 weeks because I really don't have alot to add. Loved your post, and hopefully more people will join the fight in any small way they can.  Just because I'm not vocal on here doesn't mean I'm not trying to help! I just don't feel I can intelligently participate in the threads. Have a great day!

            For anyone looking to build an audience then broadcast pizza gate messages to the audience, checkout: MassPlanner.
           </p>

            You use it to build up a following for a "niche" eg fashion, celebrity gossip etc
           </p>
           <p>
            Then once you've built your audience up - red pill them with pizza gate

              Another thing I've found works on Twitter is to go into various other people's tweets and like the replies people have made. I pick up new followers everyday doing this. I also retweet other people's tweets with #draintheswamp. I got shadowbanned for a few days using the Pizzagate hashtag.

            . Also an archiving very useful

             http://archive.is/
            </a>
            Read a relevant book  on child abuse, summarise into shortish post with people, places, dates, what happened so that the information can be used easily by others. This will take a relatively long time, but is very valuable. There are a mass of books available by people who have been sexually abused. Also organised mind control books such as Cisco Wheeler not really been summarised. The same sumamries can be done on any articles on pdfs, so that the information appears on search engines

            One more suggestion:
           </p>
           <p>
            If you're a skeptic, rather than lob ad hominem attacks, post a substantive attack on something in particular.  You might actually be right and identify something that's off base.  Ad hominem attacks and other logical fallacies will just get downvoated and fan the flames of outrage even higher -- which isn't necessarily a bad thing, either (LOL)...

             Nice suggestion. Disproving evidence is just as important. But like you said, bring substance and a clear argument. Not "it's fakkeee!"

            Great suggestions.  Thanks for putting this together.

           <p>
            A couple of grammatical corrections:
           </p>
           <p>
            "Signup" is a noun.  You mean "sign up".
           </p>
           <p>
            "Be apart of" means "be separate from".  You mean "be a part of".
           </p>

             You're welcome, I hope it helps. Don't get discouraged, anyone can create a snowball effect. You tell one person, they tell two.. those two people tell four more.. that's what we're working on here in this thread. Marketing and distributing the message / evidence.

            I have been following this investigation since it was on
            <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy">
             r/conspiracy
            </a>
            , before it was even called pizzagate. I'm not at all technologically inclined, hell I don't even know how to copy and paste, so I'm not real capable of investigating, but I have a job, bartender, that allows me to talk to many people every day.  Of those people, a few have heard of pizzagate. Usually they say it's fake news, but they're still interested. So I give them a little information, just enough to give them something to think about, but not so much that they reject it as ridiculous. Then they come back after a couple days and want to know more. So though I don't really contribute to the investigation, I am sharing your findings with the people in my tiny little part of the world. Thanks for doing the hard work all of you investigators. The general American public may not believe you, or even know what service you're doing for us, but one day it will all come to light, and all of you faceless, anonymous humanitarian investigators will know it was all worth it, and we will all be grateful for your efforts.

             By sharing you contribute a lot. Don't cut yourself short, the more people know the better. In fact I think it is one of the best ways because if you manage to get a few people interested, they could in turn also talk about it and also get a few more people interested. It may see that this is small change, but it can add up quickly.

            </p>
            <p>
             Ergo: spreading awareness and making people curious is much more important than you might expect. We can reach a lot of people if everybody on this sub would tell 2 people thats already 20k informed, if those all inform at least 2 people, we're at 40k.

              Thank you for the pat on the back. I enjoyed the math info. I didn't even know what was higher than trillion. I would love to think the people I talk to spread this story even a little bit like you've suggested.

               <em>
                Oh emperor, my wishes are simple. I only wish for this. Give me one grain of rice for the first square of the chessboard, two grains for the next square, four for the next, eight for the next and so on for all 64 squares, with each square having double the number of grains as the square before.

             You are amazing. You know how people think and that's a huge asset. Unfortunately, too many of us who believe pizza gate is real just verbal vomit all the intricate details right into the face of whosever we're talking to, which makes people think you're crazy and write the whole thing off as a crazy conspiracy.
            </p>
            <p>
             Perhaps you can make a post to help teach us how to slowly introduce the idea pizza gate to people without scaring them off?

            So I'm a mobile developer, and I'm currently making
            <a href="https://i.sli.mg/n9zUHf.gif">
             Voatify
            </a>
            , an iOS app for Voat. I haven't quite made an official announcement yet, but I actually developed the app for the sole purpose of helping with the pizzagate investigation.
           </p>
           <p>
            I'm testing the waters right now to see if there's any interest in an iOS app, since there's already a few for Android. For anyone interested, feel free to check out

             /v/voatify
            </a>
            to follow its development. I'm trying to release early-Jan 2017.

             Definitely; that's an awesome idea! 
Please can I ask for you to make it compatible with iPhone 5 (not 5s, older than that :p) as that's what I'm stuck with for the time being...on some budget constraints. Also, iOS 9...? That would be much appreciated. Hope it doesn't complicate the programming?

             I don't know if it would be possible or not, but what if the submission button took you to a form that had mandatory fields for rules 1 &amp; 2, not just the title of the post? That would cut down on spurious posts from shills as well as unintentionally inferior posts from newbies trying to contribute hastily.
             <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/user/kevdude">
              @kevdude
             </a>
             would that cut down the work for mods and reduce the unfortunate bent feelings when posts get removed? Maybe the subvoat browser submission page could be modified with mandatory fields as well? Just an idea.

             Definitely an interest here. In fact, I just searched the app store yesterday to see if there had been a Voat app released. Definitely keep moving, I would get it without a doubt. I'd be on that non stop.

             So, "echo chamber" is not relevant. But I do hear you, spreading awareness to new people is what's important - not beating a dead horse in the same circle (or "echo chamber" as you put it)

            Thank You so much for all the time, effort &amp; work going into this ~ and ofc Thanks to everyone taking the time to do something about this 💗
           </p>
           <p>
            I have mentioned in an earlier post that I have 2 different doctors I see every month. (2 different dr.s, 2 separate offices, 2 different dates) I want to help but don't really know how to
            <em>
             really
            </em>
            dig but I do try to use social media to send out the information you good people have worked so hard on.
           </p>
           <p>
            Back to the doctors; I am considering whether to make some copies of a few of the above pieces of content &amp; place them in the waiting rooms next to the magazines &amp; brochures, etc. at each of the doctors I see every month.  I want to make an impact but don't want to be too graphic since there are very often little kids running around at one of the offices. I also don't want to 'offend' people, but that's a bit difficult when the subject is so offensive to begin with.
           </p>
           <p>
            If I had the means I would think about having a glossy or brochure-type of foldouts in order to have this taken seriously &amp; share the information in a 'professional' way. But because of my health issues I just don't have the means to do it. Maybe someone else who reads this can do it &amp; use the copies to spread the information to places where they live &amp; offices or people they know.
           </p>
           <p>
            One thing I just thought of; is it legal to do something like that/leave a stack of copies on the non-cashier counters at the post office? I can call locally &amp; see if it is ok where I live. Maybe others can check with their local post office too.
           </p>
           <p>
            Just thought of the little bulletin boards at some local grocery stores around here.  You know like the "Free Puppies" or "Yard Sale this Saturday" or "After School Babysitting" type of message board.
           </p>
           <p>
            And now I feel a little sick worrying about those babysitting ads...
           </p>
           <p>
            God damn the pedo monsters.

             Just use regular computer paper. Should be quick and easy. If you need help printing let me know, I can send you a tutorial.

            <p>
             A regular printer would work or if you have some spare $$$ - go to UPS or FedEx - they can print and staple many of them for cheap.
            </p>
            <p>
             Then you can distribute this however you'd like. The doctor offices, post office, bulletin boards are all great ideas. Not sure if asking permission would go well, me personally - I'd rather just do it and ask for forgiveness later.

              could you put them on people's car windshields? Then you don't have to worry about asking anyone for permission.

               That's a good idea, canvassing has worked for years in advertising and political campaigns. Grass roots / guerilla marketing tactic.

              And as for the "do it and ask for forgiveness later", it reminds me of a saying that I love; "Seek advice and counsel, but never permission".
             </p>
             <p>
              Now ofc there are instances where one might actually/legally need permission, but otherwise, I think I'll go with your idea, because hey, I'm not afraid to apologize or ask forgiveness but I am terrified to remain quiet in the name of those who have little to no voice. :*)

            As a lurker, I'll add my 2c.  I think almost everything that can be done has been done in terms of raising awareness.  Sure, you can always do more but PizzaGate broke through into MSM to the point where they were forced to cover it.  Of course it was negative, dismissive coverage but that's about the best you can hope for in the current paradigm.
           </p>
           <p>
            The Obama administration is not going to launch a damning investigation into itself.  Our only hope in the short term is that the members of a Trump administration are as angry about this as we are and waste no time in pursuing justice after Jan 20.  If we reach a situation where they appear to be dragging their feet or are worried about upsetting the apple cart and just want to focus on the future, I will find that unacceptable.  At that point, I would suggest an all-out social media assault on the powers that be to take action.  I guarantee that I'm not alone in these sentiments.

             Great feedback, and to a point I agree. But I believe That it's about engagement as much as awareness.

             We need to keep wind in the sails if we ever hope someone in a position of power can take the lead.

            This must be something new.. perhaps there trying to enhanced security and block sign ups in the meantime? The shills are at an all time high.. flush em out!

            Another thing lurkers (who have accounts) could do, is archive links, the archive.is tool is easy and a link to it is in the sidebar (thank you Kevdude). Also, sometimes threads don't get enough attention until links are opened and excerpts are added to the comments or maybe quick summary could be put in the comments. This is really helpful for getting attention to a good thread that has a lot going on with it. Thank you FoxMcCloud11 for this thread. I hope lurkers are encouraged and start commenting or investigating. they could make a huge difference.

             Great idea. I don't know if it's even possible, but a bot that would automatically archive links posted to this sub would be amazing.

            I wonder if it's   a family member getting some justice from a failed and  compromised legal system.
           </p>
           <p>
            Below is a ytube of a man who did just that, who made no apologies for avenging his son of rape, and would rather be in jail than do nothing to protect his son with a compromised legal system that protects rapists,  and gives them less time than someone who smokes weed.

            The e-book, first link,  said,  Jeffrey Alefantis,  but his name is James, yes?
I hate to correct spelling,  because I know I get very upset about grammar/spelling Nazi's,  but in this case the correct name is important  to the accuracy  of the story.
            <br/>
            Thanks.

             - check out this comment. Appears that an incorrect name wasn't accidentally included in the eBook you shared here on Voat.

              If you are referring to the mispelling of James Alefantis name on page 3, that has been corrected. Is that the mispelling you were referring to? Sorry, I am new to this forum and don't really understand the posting architecture. Just wanted to share an eBook to spread the word, it helps for breaking the news to friends and coworkers etc. and seeing it in print sharpens the impact IMO.

            I do my best to personally inform everybody in my social circle about pedophile elites. Some laugh, some are curious, some are disgusted with the whole political/monetary elite system and "see through" the bullshit now, as most of us do. Don't give up if they scoff at you.

            Seriously though, reading through and evaluating content, and upvoating the good stuff helps to improve visibility and counteract the shills. Of course, the more you can do, the better, but assistance at all levels helps

            I've had posters on the smaller FB pizzagate-related sites ask me to "Like" them so they can subscribe and become members here. Will that work? If not what should I tell them? Sorry but I'm technically challenged and don't know how to invite a stranger. There are now about a dozen of these small FB pizza groups. You can read their posts as a screening tool before inviting them too.

            I would not get involved citizens. Figures in authority are being sent archives of THREATS that people on this web site have made against Mr. Alefantis, Mr. Craig N. From Craigslist, the Clintons, the Podesta brothers, etc. My advice would be to stay far away from this site and not spread fake news. Pizzagate is fake news. In addition, you will embarrass your family and friends.

             So, let me get this straight....  authorities would spend time and money investigating  the public, which public just wants an actual investigation that   isn't  happening with the purpose of protecting voiceless and innocent children,   rather than the police actually  investigating the names in question to determine if they are in fact complicit  in some way or other?
             <br/>
             wow,  that's one f'ed up system you're describing.
No wonder the world is in the mess it's in, with increased  desensitization of cannibalism, child porn/abuse, etc, etc.

             PizzaGate is a crowdsourced ongoing investigation and research project. It is not fake news. The "definition" by the MSM is "PizzaGate is Hillary running a child sex trafficking ring out of the back comet ping pong" - that is the "fake news".
            </p>
            <p>
             This isn't about threats or harassment - it's about getting to the truth.
            </p>
            <p>
             Sounds like you are the one making threats. My advice to you is to tell whoever the fuck is paying you to give you more money because you've got a ton of work ahead of you if want to distract or defend on the elites behalf.

            Something else they could do is when they find a certain connection to a previous post, or anything that can be connected, to simply post a link to any previous thread that contains information related to the new post if not already pointed out by poster or in comment section. That helps a lot.

             Yes, yes, yes! especially because names that are misspelled (I am guilty here) don't make the search.

             I like the #LittleLivesMatter - create a twitter handle with this and start cross promoting other hashtags. Relevant (BLM reference) and may be more resistant to censorship.

              You should be fine doing that... there are thousands of #pizzagate posters in twitter however we do need more to raise awareness. There's censorship, but we're still tweeting. See you there ; )

               I doubt they will delete it. Use the account to promotion the new hash tag and try to cross promote with #PizzaGate - create means that have the #LittleLivesMatter hash tag visible in it. Also include it in you twitter bio. The key will be to get key pizzagate twitter users to use your hashtag. A concise Voat post would also help in your effort to get lift on this hashtag. Thank you for your help - keep fighting!

            If lurkers can help fill in the new finds from the threads over to the wiki, that would be a huge help. I do not think that signing up for the wiki requires any email or personal info.

              This is the wiki...you can sign up and edit and add to it, there is already a good start, so just add what you can glean from older threads. Thanks!!!

             Excellent feedback. Could you provide a simple write up or how-to in a comment. I will add as recommendation in my post.

              this is ridiculous, I can't find the wiki. It used to be on the sidebar, now the link goes to something else that has no info in it. What am I missing? Did the wiki get scrubbed?

            You need to add a link to this or it will get deleted! Quick, add a link to some good posts you think are good examples of hard hitting pizzagate truth or something - one of the sub rules is every post has to include a link.

             That seems a bit silly considering the fact that if someone lies here, they can easily make a blog post somewhere with the exact same content....
