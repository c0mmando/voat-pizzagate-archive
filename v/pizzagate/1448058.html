<p>I couldn\'t believe what I was reading. Dahmer was spotted at the Mall where Adam was taken, multiple witnesses saw Dahmer there that day, and one saw a blue van parked outside the mall illegally, and saw Dahmer throw who they thought was Adam into the van. Now fast forward to 2002 where this is getting investigated again, at a pizza shop called &quot;Mr. Pizza&quot; where Dahmer worked at the time, and the owner Michel Pelletier is caught in a lie based on two different witnesses that say the shop owned a blue van. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>A report obtained by The Herald shows police did investigate Dahmer\'s time in South Florida -- for two weeks. The investigation began after a writer contacted them in 2002 with the names of people who remembered Dahmer and said he had access to a blue van. Detective John Kerns spoke to Sunshine Subs\' 1981 night manager Ken Haupert Jr. and Michel Pelletier, the owner of parent shop Mr. Pizza. Pelletier said he didn\'t remember Dahmer and only had trucks. Haupert Jr. remembered Dahmer but no blue van, he said. After a few dead-end records checks, Kerns concluded that &quot;this investigation has not established any link.\'\' He didn\'t contact other potential witnesses. Darlene Hill says Pelletier did own a blue van, which she used herself to move furniture. She said it belonged to Mr. Pizza. &quot;You could walk in at any time and pick up the keys,\'\' Hill said. &quot;It was absolutely chaos and people would take the van. Sometimes, maybe they\'d bring it back that day and maybe they wouldn\'t.\'\' Sunshine Subs manager Haupert Sr., who gave Dahmer a job, also remembered a blue delivery van used for Mr. Pizza. And, he recalled the day Dahmer showed him the body of a dead man behind the store. Dahmer\'s name is on a police report of the incident 20 days before Adam disappeared. The medical examiner\'s office ruled the death was by natural causes.&gt;</p>

<p>Adam Walsh\'s case was known for it\'s mishandling in it\'s investigation, could it of been on purpose? Adam Walsh\'s alleged killer is also know to be a pathological liar.

            By declaring the case solved, Walsh was able to get 'the head' removed from evidence.

            John Walsh isn't just involved with the scumbags... he IS one of the scumbags... his son's abduction from the mall was a hoax. Walsh needed money to pay off his extensive marijuana and cocaine debts so he took the fake abduction gig. What really happened to his son Adam I not know. Assuming Adam really did exist, I can only assume that Walsh sold/sacrificed him. The found 'head' did not belong to his son. Dentists have long said that Walsh is a fraud because the teeth didn't match. THEY regularly decapitate kids (as depicted in Alefantis/Podesta 'art' for starters), and THEY buy body parts from morgues. It beats me why John Walsh is not already behind bars, unless he has made a snitch deal with the FBI/CIA/etc.

             Centuries... but I think we should look back and start with the cases of Etan Patz and Adam Walsh - both of which I believe are fake abductions - and it is possible that both of them are still alive.

             Hard to get through too. I have talked to them, but you have to make sure you don't destroy the relationships with your family. It's important that they trust you, and if I start yelling about satanic rituals they're going to think I'm insane. Everyone is going to have to be calculated if we want to beat this shit.

              For now, leave the satanic part out. We have a mountain of leads surrounding them as pedofiles, As unbelievable as it may be, it is more believable than satanic rituals.

              Well as long as you're sticking with the facts, I haven't seen proof of satanic rituals for example. The emails leaked having code words that could be peadophilia related would surely hit the curiousity of most.
