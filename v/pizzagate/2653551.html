            Omg. This is so disturbing. Wow. This woman is rancid and well past her expiry date. Please look at how she wants people to buy her videos of her on the pole, etc, through her Instagram; now my question is, is she selling videos of her daughters too? Sadly, it’s looking that way. Can anyone get inside to find out what vile trash she’s actually got for videos and whether she would take requests for videos of her kids? My instinct says she would. This is so awful those poor kids. So young they don’t know any better. Fuuuuck why are people so evil.

            Been following this PG since the very beginning. I have learned a lot, ty. However, I have seen threads like this and I am dismayed and realize that this groups is sometimes looking for something that doesn’t exist. The Alice Waters thread was another that I take issue with. I pole dance for exercise, I would allow my kids to do it if they wanted to, am I a pedo for that? Hell no, and this group shows your unfounded and judgmental colours with threads like this or critique of Alice Waters (a women I know from working at an NGO 25 years ago). This couple are fit and wanted to maintain fitness on the pole. They became exotic dancers after they started pole, so what? Anyways, I just felt I needed to voice my dismay over threads like this, you are barking up the wrong tree and in doing so I start to question the other accusations made against people that I have no knowing of.

             Did you see her NSFW pole dancing? You think that's ok? Also pole dancing is dangrous for kids, that's why kids gymnastics in general is highly supervised.
            </p>
            <p>
             If you can't see this used up whore and her very female looking husband are not completely degenrate, you need to to some serious reflection. Read

            OH, I Highly Agree that those two are not what they want to be.  She looks more like a man than he does a woman, but I think you are right.

            is most definitely a man.  These morons think they now are the opposite sex.  NOpe.  They never will be, they are just making believe.  What a joke.  Sadly, it's not really funny.  They are mentally ill and need serious help.

             I'm not one to go for that "all people are trannies" stuff, you know? But here I really had some doubts, they look degenerate enough to be some mentally ill people playing with hormones. And like you said, even if they don't touch the children themselves, this environment is definintely abusive and unhealthy for children.

              Yes, I think he has dabbled in some "enhancement" of female attributes.  He is on the verge and the wife is def a male.  No doubt in my mind.  These sickos are problem enough just by themselves, but they are determined to screw up their kids too.  They are playing to others of the same ilk and hoping to spread their perverted ideas. "Touching" those children may be the next step.

            From the original description and the first photos I thought maybe you were reaching, but holy shit you have found something here! It would have been one thing if they were just former strippers who thought pole dancing was good exercise and were having their kids involved a little at home, but making such a big deal about it, plastering pics of the poor kids on the pole, and talking about "de-stigmatizing" it when mom hustles her ass selling her naked pole pics, is just creepy weird! It's obvious the pole is sexual for mom, so is she really that ignorant of what she's signaling to others about her kids on the pole?
           </p>
           <p>
            To these types, "de-stigmatize" always seems to mean having their degeneracy regarding kids accepted!

            Leaving the obvious sexual nature of pole dancing aside, there’s also a physical danger involved hanging from poles like that. That’s why children’s gymnastics is highly supervised

            If i recall correctly, I read a post about pedophile incest cults in port cities where pedos met somehow and had kids, and then molested them and started a community with likemindeds and raised their children sexual and had swapping parties where it wasn't the wife being swapped
           </p>
           <p>
            Anyway he surmised that it was an adaptation by nature to the high divorce rate, seeing that if they ever got divorced it'd ruin the lives of all involved as that shit got out… and their children marry as young as legally possible and start having lots of children to molest themselves, having met at a swapping meet earlier, and soon the only whites in Sanfran or NY will be this cult.
           </p>
           <p>
            What makes all this horrifying is by the age of ten, these kids have done every kind of sexual degeneracy thinkable and unthinkable, and are ready to pass it on.

             Palaemon is the Greek god of port cities. He became a deity along with his mother when they fall off a cliff into the sea. Could this have some relevance with the incest cult?

             That “Canadian postgrad researching at a UK university” guy is a total degenerate. What happened to this person in his childhood to make him turn out like this? I haven’t even heard of half the shit he posted as sexual kinks he’s into but he listed babies and kid type stuff, obviously another pedo. As for the Shriners and Freemasons they are a morally bankrupt bunch.

              ROJ.  Not surprised.  This is a new realm of depravity that I have not heard covered, but I do not find it one bit surprising.  I do find it thoroughly disgusting and wondering what to do about it.  People need to be very aware of what is going on in their areas and surroundings.  Too many are mind their own business.  Remember when people started saying myob?  Mind Your Own Business.  People just need to start poking into other's business when it concerns Our Children.  Start asking questions or at least keep tabs and then report it.  We are just not nosy enough anymore.
