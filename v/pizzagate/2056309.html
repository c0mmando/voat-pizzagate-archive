<p><strong>#1</strong> – There was a huge shakeup this week in a church. A real church. Not Scientology. It turns out that one of the leaders of the church got a 14 year old pregnant. The 14 year old is a half sibling of these network reality stars. </p>
<p><strong>#2</strong> – This underage teen was offered up for casting couch purposes by the parents of this current A- list network actress. The actress knows how she got her start but has never condemned the actions of her parents.</p>
<p><strong>#3</strong> – This MTV reality participant who never made it to the next step in the series got pregnant from an unknown man because her mom pimped her out to guys for money. The “dad” knows now he is not the real father.</p>
<p><strong>#4</strong> – Lost in the whole R Kelly debacle is that there is still a singer out there who is even worse. Almost a decade ago, this singer had a bunch of hits on a record. His followups have been less than stellar but he still has a name and he loves nothing more than molesting tween boys and girls. After almost getting busted here in the US, he mostly confines it to his adopted home country where he has A+ list fame and easy access to poor people who want to be with him.</p>
