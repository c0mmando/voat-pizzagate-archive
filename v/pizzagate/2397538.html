<p>This is related to Pizzagate because Q\'s &quot;Gardens and Flowers&quot; discussion on Feb. 12 <a href="https://qcodefag.github.io/data/images/cf3df150312daf57e78936f983fbc527f2e058c6b13e40d90607face2f873184.jpg">of the image</a> of Bill Clinton posing with Kim Sung Il in NK, launched a fresh investigation into possibilities of slave-gardens and the atrocious possibility of children being raised as &quot;crops&quot; in third world countries.</p>
<p><strong>SYMBOLISM OF FLOWERS ON RUG</strong></p>
<p>Q asked us what the people in picture were sitting on, and both President Clinton and Kim Sung Il were sitting on chairs located upon two white flowers. These flowers are white magnolias, the national flower of North Korea. Kim Sung Il renamed them<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=in3sDFS6X08"> &quot;mokran&quot;</a> which means &quot;orchid blooming in tree&quot;. In the video linked to above, the description says </p>
<blockquote>
<p>President Kim Il Sung and Chairman Kim Jong Il saw that many Mokran(Magnolia) trees were planted so that Mokran(Magnolia) could bloom over the country. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Is this something completely harmless and wonderful, or it could also signify the intention to launch child farms in North Korea, the symbol of which would be the white magnolia tree?</p>
<p><strong>WHITE MAGNOLIA TREES IN NORTH KOREA &gt; MANGO TREES IN HAITI?</strong></p>
<p>Where have we heard this kind of thing before? Mango trees in Haiti. Remember the cryptic <a href="https://wikileaks.org/clinton-emails/emailid/19339">Clinton email </a>where Cheryl Mills forwards Hillary an email talking about uprooting 2 mango trees and moving them to the Caracol Ekam Industrial Complex:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Only two mango trees had to be uprooted at the Caracol Park. Trees under threat are now being transplanted to the  Caracol Ekam housing.&quot; </p>
</blockquote>
<p>As other Voaters have pointed out, there wasn\'t a single mango tree anywhere in sight in the housing complex: <a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-dwv9rqMVDr0/VBnyc6whHXI/AAAAAAAAABQ/JwN9BxDgUug/s1600/ekam%2Baerial.jpg">http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-dwv9rqMVDr0/VBnyc6whHXI/AAAAAAAAABQ/JwN9BxDgUug/s1600/ekam%2Baerial.jpg</a></p>
<p>One doesn\'t have to dig far to find an orphanage named &quot;Mango Tree Village&quot; in Port-au-Prince whose <a href="https://www.google.com/search?client=opera&amp;q=mango+tree+village+orphanage&amp;sourceid=opera&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8">website</a> has Bill Clinton\'s picture and which features <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HjaFTQEKniM">a video</a> of the orphans, entitled &quot;The Mangos&quot;.  
</p>
<p><strong>DON\'T FORGET AFRICA</strong></p>
<p>On the same day that Bill Clinton visited North Korea (when he also rescued two American journalists investigating child trafficking), Hillary launched a 7-day trip to Africa. On Aug 5, she visited the Kenyan Agricultural Research Institute where <a href="https://www.standardmedia.co.ke/article/1144020855/clinton-step-up-research-for-food-security">she announced</a> a grant for agriculture development:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>wants Africa to invest more in research and technology to tackle food insecurity. Speaking at Kenya Agricultural Research Institute (Kari) yesterday, Mrs Clinton announced a $3.5 billion grant from the US Government to develop agriculture in various countries. Clinton painted a grim picture of the global food crisis, saying chronic hunger affected an estimated one billion people, with one in every three victims being African. </p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="https://still4hill.files.wordpress.com/2009/08/08-05-09-s-04.jpg?w=500">See The Witch</a> planting a tree in Kenya. Notice the happy woman in blue behind her. That is the late Wangari Maathai was an environmentalist who started <a href="http://www.yesmagazine.org/issues/media-that-set-us-free/the-green-belt-movement-the-story-of-wangari-maathai">the Greenbelt Movement</a> in Africa, planting trees.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Wangari Maathai has always had an affinity for trees. As a child, she learned from her grandmother that a large fig tree near her family home in central Kenya was sacred and not to be disturbed. She gathered water for her mother at springs protected by the roots of trees.In the mid-1970s, Maathai, in an effort to meet the basic needs of rural women, began to plant trees with them. Her non-governmental Green Belt Movement has planted 30 million trees across Kenya, many of which still stand. In 2004 her work was internationally recognized with the Nobel Peace Prize.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Now, I hope Wangari\'s work is as innocent and beatific as it sounds, but maybe we should dig (pun intended) a little more into the life and career of this Nobel Peace Prize-winning lady so beloved by people like Oprah and the Obamas.</p>
<p><strong>CONCLUSION</strong></p>
<p>Q is pointing us in a new direction of research, fertile with many possible avenues of study. Flowers, trees, gardens, agriculture . .. these may provide some vital missing links and clues to unearthing valuable information.</p>',

            I always knew Mangos was a code word. I think these might have been breeder farms. Each Mango being a facility with wet nurses incorporated into the facility. I think this was one aspect of what Monic Peterson found and was murdered for in Haiti.  Great post.

             Great job setting things up. I'm looking through search results now. It might be difficult finding much about North Korea, but one thing about the globalists is that they are not very innovative and seem to recycle the same paradigms over and over.

            in October, 2004, shortly after Clinton's visit, when she said that AIDS was created in the laboratory and used as a biological weapon for the purpose of population control. This claim was publicly corrected by the US State Dept who said, "We don't agree with that." By December, 2004, Wangari, who had a PhD in biology,

            UpVoats Are In Order!!! You have written up another Magnificent and Amazing Report.  Cod Words are used to disguise their operations.  They have Code Words for their drugs, child trafficking, and organ harvesting I am sure.  Certainly when they are moving around and shipping such Secret Contraband, we do not expect them to use the correct words.

            Most definitely the word Mangoes could be Code Word for Children.  We know that they have done this before.  Here is the analogy from that link:  Background: The email is about the shipment of mangos from Pakistan to Chicago / Jake Sullivan, which Mary Beth Goodman (Senior Economic Advisor to Special Representative for Afghanistan and Pakistan) has arranged for. This may all be innocent, although several things in this email strike me as odd, and *mango *could be used as a code word for children / child trafficking here (will elaborate / edit later when I know whether we can have a look at the attached photos or not). But I would really like to have a look at those boxes (size, shape, design, printing etc.)  AND Yes.  Mangoes in Haiti also talk for Children.  Notice at the bottom or the email it mentions Richard Branson.  Yes, they are using Symbols in Movies and now in Paintings.  They have been doing it all along, without us suspecting.  Until Now.

             Mangoes from the subcontinent were banned in the US for almost 20 years over pesticide concerns.

             We lifted the ban on Indian Mangoes in 2007.

              Indian mangoes arrive in the U.S. after long hiatus
First shipment of Indian mangoes gets cleared for sales in American stores after a 18-year ban.
             </p>
             <p>
              The first shipment of Indian mangoes - arguably some of the best and juiciest varieties in the world - were officially cleared for retail sale in the United States on Tuesday after an 18-year hiatus.
             </p>
             <p>
              The United States, which estimates its market size for mangoes to be a sizeable 250,000 tons, imports the fruit mainly from Mexico and other Central American countries.
             </p>
             <p>
              Although India is the world's largest producer of mangoes, accounting for close to 50 percent of the world's output, the U.S. banned Indian mango exports in the mid-1980s over concerns that Indian farmers used hazardous pesticides to protect the fruit crop.

             Pakistan wanted the same deal as India.  Pakistani mangoes are said to be even more delicious than Indian mangoes.
            </p>
            <p>
             When the Indian ban was lifted and the first mangoes came to the US,  a friend got some and gave us one and watched us eat it.   They are really delicious, much more flavorable than caribbean mangoes.
            </p>
            <p>
             This was a big trade issue for Pakistan and that is the context of this email.   You can google and see tons of news stories about this.

              Hi, AreWeSure! Excellent point that the mango industry from India and Pakistan is a perfectly legitimate enterprise. However, that does not preclude the possibility that child/drug trafficking is being conducted under its cover, and I think we have Jean-Louis Warnholz' email to Cheryl Mills to thank for raising doubts that "mangoes" might be code for something else. More information is needed, of course, but it's also legitimate to have questions, considering all the devious activity that occurred in Haiti with more revelations coming out all the time.
             </p>

               this interesting article

              "Mango Diplomacy" is very real, and Hillary tried very hard to use it to her advantage in Pakistan, but the average Pakistani was very suspicious of deals with Americans. Very illuminating article

              about Hillary's Mango Diplomacy which says:
             </p>
             <blockquote>
              <p>
               When reporters asked fruit vendors and people on the streets and in markets on how did they feel about Hilary’s visit and comments about Pakistani mangoes, some of them replied that “ America’s interests in Pakistan is much more than Pakistani mangoes”.
              </p>
             </blockquote>
             <p>
              Hillary certainly did her best to win over the Pakistanis:
             </p>
             <blockquote>
              <p>
               Hilary and her team believe that the accord signed between Afghanistan and Pakistan set a positive tone to ease suspicions among the U.S and Pakistan and also it helped to convey the message to Pakistani people that how much they are supportive to ordinary Pakistanis and their well-being. This is what part of her mission was when she came with a raft of initiatives in Public health, irrigation and agriculture, building a hospital in Karachi and help farmers to export their mangos.

             </blockquote>
             <p>
              The article is also interesting because it talks about "exploding mangoes" and a theory that nerve gas hidden in a case of mangoes caused the assassination of President Zia in 1988.
             </p>
             <p>
              Mangoes are a very big deal in other continents, and it's entirely possible that much subterfuge and nefariousness could be associated with them.

               You only grasp part of my point.  The fact that Mills and Clinton are not talking in code is backed up by the outside evidence I presented.      "Does not preclude the possibility" is not really a standard of evidence is it?  It's a philosophical exercise.
              </p>
              <p>
               Think about the alternatives, drug smuggling from Pakistan couldn't have occurred until the US Mango ban was lifted?   Drugs couldn't have been smuggled in any of the other products that Pakistan WAS EXPORTING to the US?   What's so special about mangoes?  It makes no sense.  It's not like there's some before mangoes, no drug smuggling, after mangoes a drug pipeline.

                No public proof exists yet that drugs or children have been smuggled into the US via mango export trade from Pakistan, you are correct, but given the Clinton Foundations' track record in Haiti, we can certainly expect the same shady characters (Hillary Clinton, Cheryl Mills, Jean-Louis Warnholz) to set up similar profit-making schemes in other countries.

It would be wrong to set up such opportunities while in office.    I know that Cheryl Mills got a clearance from the State Department ethics office before taking that job.

                  If you don't like the Breitbart article, maybe you'll like the NYT article more:
                  <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/17/us/hillary-clinton-cheryl-mills.html">
                   https://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/17/us/hillary-clinton-cheryl-mills.html

                 <p>
                  The BlackIvy Group's dubious business deals don't seem to benefit the natives in Haiti and Tanzania, from all accounts. I could also send you articles on how the Caracol-EKAM project is despised by the Haitians. Cheryl's garment industry (sweat shops?) does not seem to be booming in Tanzania, either. One hardly needs justification for having concerns about other projects Hillary and Cheryl have teamed up on. You are correct that no evidence of wrong doing in the MUAVAN Pakistan mango/USAID partnership has surfaced yet, but that doesn't mean that one shouldn't be looking into the possibility of it,  considering the track record of the pay-for-play activities of the Clinton Foundation and the suspect nature of the Black Ivy Group.

                  Yes, I saw that about the Russians. We shall see if this amounts to anything, even if it gives Russophobic, neo-McCarthyite Dems a big thrill. BTW, I listened to Lee Stranahan interviewing our friend Andrei Nekrasov last week on Faultlines about the upcoming presidential election in the Russian Federation. Fascinating to hear Andrei's angle on things.

                   yeah, because the NY Times is such a good source on Hillary Clinton.  ;)  They actually worked with Breitbart's Peter Schweizer on the Uranium One disaster.

                   yeah, I read the NY Times article and seems to say something...  perhaps it says something, maybe?

                   As an example of how poor this articles are, BlackIvy has no deals in Haiti.   But that article sure made it seems that way.    An investor in BlackIvy has a company that is in Haiti.   And they employ 10,000 people and built and funds a primary and secondary school.   Is that not good for the natives?
