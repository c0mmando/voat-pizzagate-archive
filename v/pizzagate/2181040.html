<p>A man accused of &quot;marrying&quot; his stepdaughter when she was 11-years-old, then holding her prisoner and repeatedly raping her for 19-years, has been arrested in Mexico and extradited to the US.
Henri Michele Piette, 62, has been charged with first-degree rape and other offences by authorities in Oklahoma after Rosalynn McGinnis, now 33, made her way to the US embassy in Mexico.
There, she told investigators she was &quot;married&quot; by a then 15-year-old son of Mr Piette’s in the back of a van the day before he was due to marry her mother. </p>
<p>Ms McGinnis’s mother later left Mr Piette because of his violent behaviour and lived with her daughter in protective accommodation, The Oklahoman reported.
He is alleged to have kidnapped Ms McGinnis, then 12, in 1997 while she was at school.</p>
<p>The newspaper reported an FBI agent saying in court: &quot;After being introduced to ... Piette\'s other children as their new mother, they began travelling to numerous locations throughout the United States and abroad including ... Texas, Montana, Idaho, New Mexico, Arizona and Mexico.&quot;
Mr Piette is described by investigators as having “deep ties” to Central America and Mexico and criminal organisations there.</p>
<p>He allegedly went to great lengths to hide his family’s location, including travelling to locations they had already left to post letters to indicate they were still there.
In captivity, Ms McGinnis alleged that she was subjected to near daily sexual assaults and bore nine children.</p>
<p>She said she suffered beatings, torture and was even stabbed shot during her time in Mexico.
It was only when a woman who lived near her home in Mexico brought a cake for her children that she finally revealed something was wrong. Mr Piette was out the room at the time.</p>
<p>The woman found Ms McGinnis &quot;missing&quot; poster online and contacted the authorities.
“I knew that if I didn’t get out of there, I’d either go insane or I would end up dying and leaving my kids with that man,” Ms McGinnis told People magazine.</p>
<p>She waived her right to anonymity after returning to the US, saying: &quot;I want the world to know. I want him to be stopped and I want justice to be served.&quot;</p>',

            Good luck to this girl in getting justice for this piece of garbage.  He has deep connections and they will pull out all stops.  I hope to God I am so very wrong.  Yes, if he raped her all those years while she was a child lifetime in jail is too good for him.  I pray  for him to at least thrown in the slammer.  He is a very sick man.  If he introduced her to his children as their mother when she was eleven  he is totally demented.  He saw that perfectly normal.  I would love to question his children.  Sigh.  This is not getting any better, just that it is coming out into the open. And that IS Good.

            What in the actual world??!!  I pray she gets justice . This world is so jacked up ! What really goes on behind people's doors ? People are popping up out of the woodwork , being exposed left and right ! They all have a chance to come forward and repent , most of them won't and those ones will be destroyed . The picture of who will be destroyed at Armageddon is clearer by the minute ! IMO
