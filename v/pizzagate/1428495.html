            I have a big dump on this inc, it seems that every site i crawl has external urls to other sites that are similar in nature. not sure if this is an elaborate ARG for something unrelated or not, either way, i will post my findings.

            Bizarre. The weird links just keep on popping up. Something is going be be definitively connected EVENTUALLY if we keep digging. Great work!

            i poked around after someone (you?) linked this on
            <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/pizzagate">
             r/pizzagate
            </a>
            - rather disturbing stuff.  and really, just a seemingly endless maze.
           </p>
           <p>
            i applaud you for digging into this; i also wonder if there are keys necessary to get at what's really here.  or maybe it's just signaling/messaging.

            the strobe page had me noping out - try not to get too lost in this maelstrom.
