            Don't forget about Irma bearing down on the East coast.  The Deep State wants to usher in WWIII.  They thrive on chaos and war.  It feeds their souls and provides them the hell they need to thrive.
           </p>
           <p>
            Wait until the flood waters recede in Houston and the disease starts setting in.  Then looters - mostly whites shooting blacks - start a race war.  Smack the East coast with another one next week somewhere - this time, it will be wind devastation.  Similar after effects.  I'm starting to buy in bulk ; )

            Trumps is so smart.  He knows that the uniparty, deepstate , marxists, AND MEDIA, have been planning on controlling the poor in the inner cities for a long time.  Drugs allowed to flow in. Now, small towns are being filled with drugs.   Dumb em down, keep them in poverty, keep the government machine  and the ELITES in power...that's what it's been all about.  Get the people good and mad, and revolution against the govt ensues.  Now, Trump knows their game.  He's attacking the rat lines.  He's gonna win, and they're scared.

            Donald Trump hung out with Epstein and flirts with10 year old girls. His eyes are on pizzagate all right.

             Trump was always friendly with everyone, he made this clear before he even ran. He had to be friendly to all sides. He had to play that role because he was a business man. It doesn't mean that he actually took part in that shit, it just means hes aware of it, and they know hes aware of it. Hes clean from crimes, if he wasn't, they would've got him out already.

             You're a shill.  Trump's rounding up all the pedos, and Epstein first in line.  Trump doesn't flirt with 10 year olds.  You're playing the blame game...accusing others of what you do yourself.   You will be held accountable for the evil you support.

              Because PresudentMcCheese and DonkeyButtHole will always oppose the truth, of course hes not a pedo, he is being persecuted because they hate him because he knows exactly what they are.  My thought on him being on the Epstein once was that he didn't realise how depraved they were until that trip. I believe they tried to compromise him too, but because he does not drink do drugs and has known OCD when it comes to cleanliness they could not get him. Since then he has been biding his time until he can expose them all and put them behind bars. This is my opinion and unless definite proof is available, not insinuations, I trust him. Favourite quote from him:-  Killary 'Donald Trump not in charge of the law in our country' Donalds reply 'because you'd be in jail!'  CLASSIC!

               Hello again my friend 😁 I totally agree with you! Great minds think alike. I just hope that he follows them with Hillary. So many of his supporters expect him to keep that promise.

              The fact that Kurt Smolek's body was pulled from the Potomac would indicate some serious shit is going down.
Cambodia has been a long time hotspot for underage sex and is recognized as being orchestrated with one of the Negraponte brothers (who is MIT affiliated with all the supposed connections to Aaron Schwartz's murder).
Just after General Flynn was ousted from the Trump administration, unconfirmed rumors placed him as being placed in the Bureau of Intelligence and Research - the State Department's intelligence arm - under the auspices of Tillerson.
Agent Smolek may very well have been murdered due to his investigation, which would be a sign of desperation by these motherfuckers.
             </p>
             <p>
              Pro tip ... Mike Flynn is one of the true heros of our times.
Anyone, ANYONE who attacks this man is prima facie suspect of being part of the dark side.

             Ok can you not be a bitch ass for one post and tell me clearly why you think that black people's organs are only for black people. Where did you get this information? Or is this just because of racism?
            </p>
            <p>
             Do you have some links or something? I'm truly curious.

              It obviously improves the chances of successful transplantation to maintain the same ethnicity and the govt actively encourages minorities to donate because they are not as pathologically altruistic as whites.
             </p>
             <p>
              Maybe theyd be more likely to donate if idiots werent telling them the WHITE ELITE is harvesting them

             Race is not taken into account in the sense that they do not use it as a factor in finding a match. E.g., if you are black and need an organ, they do not look only to black donors. However, it is more likely that someone from your own race is a match simply because of genetic similarity. Therefore, it is going to be more common to see people have a donor of the same race only because the probability of a match being the same race of a recipient is higher than the probability of a match being from a different race.
            </p>
            <p>
             The main criteria they look for in a match is

              blood type, tissue type, physical condition, and age

              Yes but also consider racial motivations behind some of these evil atrocities. Race is obviously not the driving force, but it's a big factor.

                It's not the "racism lie." Skin color and race literally play a role in their belief system, and what they choose to eat for dinner, but you know this.

               I am totally serious. But in that context I was saying the reverse of what Donkey Hole says is true. But to a larger extent, inherent racism is part of this entire atrocity. Globalist elites believe cannibalizing blacks give them "magic, special powers." This is the main reason slavery actually happened in the US. This is why Planned Parenthood is strategically placed in black neighborhoods. They are creating a supply chain.

               It's all bullshit mumbo-jumbo, it's like when people eat rare shark fin or elephant tusk. Speaking of which, this cannibal cult also makes endangered species goes extinct too. (Like the black rhinos, or the unicorn.)

                  This DonkeyButtHole has many alters and a filthy mouth.  I have had him blocked for months now and only make comments so others are aware that he is a shill/troll.  He is always argumentative with ANYONE he can annoy, total waste of time and energy.  I did not realise he was actually siding with rapists though!  Makes sense.  I wonder what his true identity is, I think we would not be surprised to find out he has ties with Alefantis or Majestic Ape type people. His language certainly fits. :) Different subject, its getting really exciting lately, break through coming I feel.  Children to be saved from these people, keep digging and keep well my friend.

                  And be honest - their is a hierarchy in preference, with white kids being at the top and blacks being at the bottom of the...er...food chain.  But applies to sex slaves as well.

                   It depends which region of consumers you're referring too. Saudis prefer white kids for instance. The whole situation is a complete mess.

                    Everyone wants white kids.  They just can't afford them.  Hence the underlying tone in all of the "pizza code" which, to me, sounds like certain "pizza" is far more "valuable" than others.

                    When you look at the child disappearance rates, far more minority kids, especially black and latino disappear than white kids.  The odds of grabbing a white kid with two parents, some connections, and a little clout to sound the alarm makes it a far more difficult catch - the white child.
