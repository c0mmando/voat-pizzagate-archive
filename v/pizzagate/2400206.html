<p>In 1999, Nicole Kidman, with then husband Tom Cruise, starred in Eyes Wide Shut, the final film of Stanley Kubrick.</p>

<p>Fiona Barnett  says &quot;The main perpetrator of my child sexual abuse, Antony Kidman, is dead after I filed formal complaints accusing him of the rape, torture and murder of children in an exclusive Sydney pedophile ring.</p>
<p>&quot;As a child victim of mind control I feel he\'s been sacrificed for failing to adequately program me.</p>
<p>&quot;Kidman was responsible for ensuring that I never disclosed pedophile ring activities that I witnessed as a child...&quot;</p>
<p><a href="https://images-blogger-opensocial.googleusercontent.com/gadgets/proxy?url=http%3A%2F%2F4.bp.blogspot.com%2F-oZ0sXzTcpCc%2FVBacfi8K-XI%2FAAAAAAAAF_U%2F7c7Ltv8x-ck%2Fs1600%2Fnicole-kidman-lost-two-babies.jpg&amp;container=blogger&amp;gadget=a&amp;rewriteMime=image%2F*">I lost two babies</a></p>
<p>Since the age of three Fiona Barnett had been trapped inside Australia’s vast pedophile network where children were sex trafficked, hunted down for sport and murdered.</p>
<p><a href="https://images-blogger-opensocial.googleusercontent.com/gadgets/proxy?url=http%3A%2F%2F4.bp.blogspot.com%2F-O0nwS85k2e0%2FVBadrm7oEvI%2FAAAAAAAAF_c%2F29zjjfY32M0%2Fs1600%2Fweasel.jpg&amp;container=blogger&amp;gadget=a&amp;rewriteMime=image%2F*">&quot;MI5, MI6, A.S.I.O. Agent Provocateur, Gang Stalker, Neo-nazi, Traitor, Freemason, Satanist, Psychopath, Murderer and Police Protected Pedophile.&quot; macpc.org.au.</a></p>
<p><strong>Fiona Barnett</strong> says: &quot;Perpetrators took turns sneaking up on me. A large group of men arrived in pick up trucks. They carried rifles and had a pack of starving Doberman dogs.</p>
<p>&quot;I was told that the group of naked children huddled nearby were my responsibility. I was to run and hide them.</p>
<p>&quot;Every child I failed to hide would be killed and fed to the dogs.</p>
<p>&quot;They painted something on my back and chest, and then released us. I pushed the children up over the first steep hill.</p>
<p>&quot;It was about the second or third hill that the hunting party reached us. Shots were fired and children began dropping all around me. With all hope lost of my saving the other children, I took off and ran for my life.&quot;</p>
<p>Barnett’s <strong>Nazi</strong> grandfather\'s pedophile network was said to include clinical psychologists <strong>Kidman and John W. Gittinger</strong> who developed a popular test among psychiatric professionals known as the Personality Assessment System.</p>
<p>Who, undoubtedly worked alongside Psychologist Dr. Henry Alexander Murray of Harvard University who was the CIA’s preeminent elder statesman. During World War II, he left Harvard as the director of the Harvard Psychological Clinic to join the Office of Strategic Services (OSS) as a lieutenant colonel. </p>
<p>Which, leads right back to the Maccoby\'s and James Alefantis\' Comet Ping Pong:</p>

<p>Barnett had named as her perpetrators her grandfather, Kidman, two former Australian prime ministers, a Parliament House governor general and a state police commissioner.</p>
<p>As with child pedophile rings in the Netherlands, Europe, Canada and the US, the Australian pedophile network was said to include police officers, psychiatrists, biochemists, psychologists, actors, writers, politicians, university lecturers and medical doctors.</p>
<p>&quot;The Commission was in the process of investigating my complaint when Kidman was found to have left the country,&quot; Barnett said.</p>
<p>&quot;Now one month following my notification against Kidman, he is dead. Kidman’s death comes as no surprise. In the past week alone, two people predicted his imminent demise.&quot;</p>

<p>In 2004, ID Models boss Zampolli was exposed as a former business associate/partner of the infamous convicted Pedophile Island financier, Jeffrey Epstein. In 2004, Zampolli and Epstein unsuccessfully tried to buy Elite Model Management at auction.

<p>Paolo Zampolli has a Dominican diplomatic passport and is officially the Ambassador of the Commonwealth of Dominica for Oceans and Seas- an absolute joke. According to the UN’s Blue Book, Zampolli is Dominica’s (lone) Deputy Permanent Representative to the UN. There is great concern that Zampolli is using his stable of MK ULTRA Sex Kittens at the UN to compromise and bribe foreign heads of state, officials, diplomats and ambassadors.</p>
<p>ZAMPOLLI is an old world BLOODLINE of the Italian AGNELLI/FIAT family. The Agnelli family intermarried with one of the leading ruling families of old Europe that goes back to ancient Etruscans. They are part of the ancient HOUSE OF BOURBON.</p>
<p>The House of Bourbon is a European royal house of French origin, a branch of the Capetian Dynasty. Bourbon kings first ruled France in the 16th century. By the 18th century, members of the Bourbon dynasty also held thrones in Spain, Naples, Sicily, and Parma, Spain and Luxembourg currently have Bourbon monarchs, OLD WORLD SATANIC POWER ELITE.</p>

           In 2004, ID Models boss Zampolli was exposed as a former business associate/partner of the infamous convicted Pedophile Island financier, Jeffrey Epstein. In 2004, Zampolli and Epstein unsuccessfully tried to buy Elite Model Management at auction. Now, very few if any tie these two figures together in the inner circle of Donald Trump, who's daughter Ivanka modeled for ID,  Bill and Hilary Clinton.

           Paolo Zampolli has a Dominican diplomatic passport and is officially the Ambassador of the Commonwealth of Dominica for Oceans and Seas- an absolute joke. According to the UN’s Blue Book, Zampolli is Dominica’s (lone) Deputy Permanent Representative to the UN. There is great concern that Zampolli is using his stable of MK ULTRA Sex Kittens at the UN to compromise and bribe foreign heads of state, officials, diplomats and ambassadors.

           ZAMPOLLI is an old world BLOODLINE of the Italian AGNELLI/FIAT family. The Agnelli family intermarried with one of the leading ruling families of old Europe that goes back to ancient Etruscans. They are part of the ancient HOUSE OF BOURBON.

           The House of Bourbon is a European royal house of French origin, a branch of the Capetian Dynasty. Bourbon kings first ruled France in the 16th century. By the 18th century, members of the Bourbon dynasty also held thrones in Spain, Naples, Sicily, and Parma, Spain and Luxembourg currently have Bourbon monarchs, OLD WORLD SATANIC POWER ELITE.

            I am not complaining I am making decent points and I am suggesting a little mercy and call it favoritism if it suits you but I call it common sense. If I owned a business and one of my best customers needed help loading a truck I would help him. I ain't no goddamn truck loading service but i'm a courteous person. I realize Falcon rattled the nerve box but people need to calm down. The title fetish is oveboard like a bunch of SJWs worried about bad words.

             Esoteric, I think you are still on the battlefield. Take some R&amp;R. Savor an adult beverage and realize that if formatting or an apparently unsourced claim in a serious thread full of sourced claims puts a post in violation of the rules, you'll have 24 hours to fix it before anyone does anything with it. That is the new reality. A new wind is blowing in here. Breathe deep and enjoy it. We've got a Swamp to clear out. :-)

           <p>
            Do you remember a few weeks ago I wrote about this A list celebrity with A++ list political connections who was meeting several times a week with the wife of an A+++ list criminal. Yeah, well it turns out there is some money laundering going on which our A list celebrity has been coordinating. This is going to blow up and look so bad. I guarantee someone will be able to piece together some way that a percentage of the money taken as a fee for laundering is supporting terrorists or something akin to it.

            All that laundered money involving the foreign born infamous A+ list celebrity and his wife and her very connected political friend is being put to a new use now. Buying a jury member.

            . I am now the designated asshole who gets to ask you repost this with a clear headline that explains what all these names have in common and why they're important. Sorry man. This is just not "clear." What we need is a title that spells out the Pizzagate Premise you're asserting with all these different links. Why are these all in one post? What is it you want people to take away, or perhaps do in response?
           </p>
           <p>
            Also, you've got a major claim in the middle of the thread with no supporting link:
           </p>

             You pulled one little detail out of a thousand details and burned a whole post over it. I know it had a couple of other little things but come on Man.....this post took time. Like

             I understand your reasoning but you know Asolo. I think you should have given him a warning and let him know that next time it might get pulled. Don't falcon us man. I fought hard for you and

              I hear you, ES. Under the new system, this kind of thing will be flaired for edit, not removed. That was not in place, yet, when I removed his post and we've already had landmines exploding in here randomly for the past three days. There are many changes afoot Voatwide involving Putt's new voting system which will be here by the end of the month, and many dramas in different subverses. You saw what happened with VSD when Crensch and kevdude went out on a limb somewhat and demodded Falcon. Voat is watching what we do here in terms of moderation, as are the enemies of pizzagate. We can't be arbitrary.
             </p>
             <p>
              I hope you can appreciate the tremendous opportunity we have over the next week to completely change the dynamic here to one that is fundamentally positive, collaborative and fair and even take a leading role in making that happen. It won't last long. ASolo was gracious and that attitude will be contagious. Once the new mod system stabilizes, there will be a fresh discussion of the rules. We'll get there.

              You had a number of links, ASolo, and I didn't dig into every one of them. Especially today, when my inbox is overflowing with helping get think- up to speed. Why not hyperlink the text itself to the relevant material?

              As you well know, I can't "put it back up."  The title was not clear to either

              or to me. It certainly won't be clear to new users. Just answer the question, "Why is this post important to Pizzagate" and make a title out of the answer. You can put your current list of key words after it and a colon.
             </p>
             <p>
              Also, I've got O's breathing down my neck to make sure we are enforcing the rules consistently. For an explanation of why, see
              <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/v/pizzagate/2398840/11943257">
               here
              </a>
              . If you care about the well-being of the sub, please don't take this removal personally. We will hopefully have a new and better way of doing things using flairs soon.

               Yep, I get it, I mean I get YOUR reasoning but anyone that has followed and even those that don't I think there was a pretty clear path, but overall I get your point and thanks for being diplomatic about it. I'll 'correct ' that and put it back out.

            Great post! Yes, I have spoken in the past to Fiona, completely believe her. For some reason, people (including Enty at CDAN) are afraid to go after her or expose her. She is also a victim, but Nicole Kidman is to me, so obviously a mind control ritual abuse victim endorsed by the Deletes

            Melania was raised as a Roman Catholic in the Nation State of Slovenia bordered by Italy to the west, Austria to the north, Hungary to the northeast, Croatia to the south and southeast. Slovenes believe that they are descendants of Slavs who came to Central Europe in the 6th century AD. Some nationalists say that Slovenes are a master race that their ancestors (Venetic Theory) have lived in the lands of modern Slovenia since prehistory. The “Windischar Theory” argued that the Slovenes were actually Windischars (Slavicized Germans).[22]
           </p>
           <p>
            On April 6, 1941 Slovenia was occupied and divided between the Nazis, Italian, and Hungarian invaders. The Nazi racial and purification policies were instituted and the mass killings began in Slovenia. ” … There is hardly any trace of Jews within today’s Slovenia, and in Slovenian contemporary history.”[23] Melinia is not a supermodel, and never has been a supermodel. Out of Central Europe, she became a notable model, but not a supermodel.

            He brought Marina out of Milan, Italy to New York where his front, ID Models, paid her rent. A Slovenian magazine, Suzy, investigated Melinia and Zampolli. Their conclusion was Zampolli was a pimp, and she was a Zampolli executive “WHORE.”

            Zampolli runs an illegitimate international escort racket with stables of mind controlled East European Sex Slaves. He passed down a “sex kitten”  charter from the Old World Ruling Houses of Europe, Knights Templar, and Freemasonry  to Donald Drumpf, Jeffrey Epstein and the Mossad [Ehud Barak].

It was cut off and substituted with the meaningless ending at the mall.
