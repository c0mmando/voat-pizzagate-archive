            In the Toxic Avenger there are a lot of extraneous scenes with kids in them.  There is a whole minute of kids eating ice cream. You can get an idea if you watch minute 58 of this youtube video although it is zoomed in and crops out most of it.

            Other versions of the movie on youtube have that scene edited out.

            Cheese Pizza = Child Porn, Clean Strong = Child Sex, Lloyd says that when they aren't going after their slice, sometimes they make horror or comedy movies.
           </p>
           <p>
            I guess producing low budget movies is a good way to launder your CP money.

             WOW! Nail on the head... Troma films pop up all over, they aren't good, I've always wondered how those films seemed omnipresent  across various digital movie hubs. Haha, this explains it to me.

             GREAT COMMENT! I noticed that too. Actually he was very blatant about what he was promoting! Currently, he bills himself as a horror/comedy producer.

            Thank you for those additions, Psalm144. The guy is definitely suspicious and needs the full pizzagate colonoscopy treatment. But I am not seeing anything that really supports you claim that:
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             in many cases outright call for, satanic child sacrifice. There is also no shortage of pedo-themed "jokes" on his various social media platforms.
            </p>
           </blockquote>
           <p>
            The problem with the "chicken" pic is that you are not providing any of the actual real life context for it. What is "toxie," referenced in the hashtag he is using for all of these pics? And what was the film this pic is from about, as referenced by this commentor:
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             thecoolestheidi_I really wish I could have been there. I followed the progress online. I want to come over and work on something soon... Need a post production supervisor??
            </p>
           </blockquote>
           <p>
            Who are all these other IG accounts he is tagging?
           </p>
           <p>
            Here's my concern, please don't take this personally. I could be wrong. However, the fact that you posted all of this in a way that pushes a pedo spin for it all
            <strong>
             without giving the real life context for any of it as a true research thread should do
            </strong>
            , and publicized it without making an archive of these images or posting screenshots, makes this
            <em>
             look

            like a disinfo campaign aimed at triggering a witchhunt that helps Gunn get his job back and alerts Troma folks to make their social media accounts private before we can get to them.

            is not a place to push pet theories with one-sided interpretations. It's place to research theories by examining evidence, rule out disinfo and fake news, and thereby get to the bottom of elite corruption that harms kids.
           </p>
           <p>
            Therefore I am going to leave this flair on for now, so you can address the issues of evidence supporting your specific claim of pedo jokes and outright calls for child sacrifice.

            Assuming those links are provided and we don't have to delete this for Rule 2, it will need an "Accuracy in Question" flair due to it's heavy spin, missing context, and potential witchhunt-pushing.

            Lloyd Kaufman's business partner at Troma is Michael Herz.  Listen to the first minute of his interview where Herz says that Kaufman was a senior at Yale and had a television in his room which attracted a lot of young men and where he was taught a few things by the older Kaufman which he didn't know could be so beautiful- ahem...

            That clip was from an old CNN "Showbiz Today"--probably 1984, the year the show first aired. Interestingly, Kaufman said Troma had been around for 15 years. That means it was started around 1974-75. Without the internet, distribution of por*n films would have been done the old fashioned way. The new CNN show would have been eager to fill its guest roster, and did not yet rate A+ lister interviews. Kaufman saw his chance to get in some free advertising for his "films."  GREAT FIND!

            , we're going to need more links than just this video supporting your claims that this is directly related to Pizzagate. Like the pedo-themed social media posts he's made for example. I'll give you the 24 Hour Grace flair so you can edit. Thanks.

            I couldn't hear much, but when he pulled that huge gooey piece of pizza out, I wanted to throw up.  There is no way you are wrong about what this perverted pedo scumbag is up to.
