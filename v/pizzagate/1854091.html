On Paul Ryan, Speaker of the House, normally third in the line of succession, I can report as fact that sources say that Ryan has been legally intercepted, and is on tape, admitting that he knew Russian money was being laundered into the Republican party.</p>

Louise Mensch is quite a nutjob who frequently accuses people on twitter who disagree with her Russian shills. That being said, her sources seem to be legit and she has called several stories (like the FISA warrants, grand jury subpoenas, and now FBI raids) well before the MSM picked up on them. Will be interesting to see how this plays out and it\'s good to see that with each passing the day the Trumpets have a harder time keeping control of the narrative here.</p>

What about the Israeli and Saudi Arabian money? Are they going after that too</p>
<p>Edit: just read the story. It appears to have nothing to do with foreign money, Russian or otherwise.</p>

Julian Assange refers to Virginia as the &quot;Rocket Docket&quot; because the state is overpopulated with members of the military/intelligence sector. When cases are brought to grand jury--they rubber-stamp the cases.</p>

            "Rogers (owner of the raided establishment) said the FBI investigation concerns work the firm performed during the 2013 Virginia gubernatorial campaign of former Virginia Attorney General Ken Cuccinelli, a Republican. Rogers insisted the investigation did not involve Maryland politics and that the firm had done nothing wrong."

             I suggest everyone verify for themselves. I saw cernovich posted a little while ago so it is in early stages. There is one user who already says debunked but I have not had time to confirm.

              At absolute minimum, Paul Ryan is guilty of misprision of treason, gross negligence, and misconduct in office among other crimes. He and Priebus are covering up massive criminal corruption, trafficking and Pizzagate-related crimes in the Racine, Kenosha and Milwaukee areas including racketeering that links to the Club for Growth, Clinton Foundation, DNC and RNC including John McCain, Lindsey Graham, and Ashton Kutcher. There are many reasons why Racine is so important, and much of it ties to the Pilgrims Society, Knights of Pythias, the United Nations and Agenda 2030, Council on Foreign Relations, the church, the mafia and gangs such as MS-13. George Webb has connected quite a few things with Racine lately including earlier this week regarding dialysis and pain management centers. It is the birthplace of Sustainable Development, Community Policing, Educational Reform, and other related global initiatives. There is a reason why Paul Ryan yields so much undeserved power.

              Racine has a long history connected to satanic ritual abuse, pedo crimes, trafficking, underground tunnels, and the origins of the Illuminati and Freemasonry linked with Luciferian giants and Native American mounds.
