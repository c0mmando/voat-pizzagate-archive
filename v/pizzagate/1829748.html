<p>By now, we know this stuff is not a coincidence. Butterflies, spirals, and organ harvesting.. that\'s enough to warrant some digging. If you register to donate organs at the DMV, this organization is the one who handles them.</p>

In short, they took this guy apart, and took his whole heart with no consent. Many negative reviews of them complain that they could at least offer monetary compensation to organ donors, as they make a profit.. their head alone takes in a salary of $700,000 annually.</p>
<p>I think this may be something.. I\'ve stepped away from investigative research regarding Pizzagate/Pedogate, but thought I\'d offer this lead to anyone willing.</p>

              No but rich and gay outweighs Jewish and even zionist. And I've examined hundreds of PG related individuals.

            "Many negative reviews of them complain that they could at least offer monetary compensation to organ donors/their families, as they make a profit."

            They can't pay donors or their families.  Buying organs is a violation of the National Organ Transplant Act of 1984.

            As we have all seen, organ "donation" is a HUGE RACKET!!  Plus it's likely to get you killed before you otherwise would go.

            Add to that, what do you think is the preferable option for possible nefarious characters who have your life in their hands: A) Save your life, or B) Profit hugely off of your body parts.
