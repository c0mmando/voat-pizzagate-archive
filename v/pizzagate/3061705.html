<h2 id="md-a-jury-delivered-the-unanimous-verdict-on-11-december-in-melbournes-county-court-but-the-result-was-subject-to-a-suppression-order-and-could-not-be-reported-until-today.">A jury delivered the unanimous verdict on 11 December in Melbourne’s county court, but the result was subject to a suppression order and could not be reported until today.</h2>
<p><strong>SUMMARY</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Pell, who is on leave from his role in Rome as Vatican treasurer, was found guilty of sexually penetrating a child under the age of 16 as well as four charges of an indecent act with a child under the age of 16.</strong> </p>
<p><strong>The offences occurred in December 1996 and early 1997 at St Patrick’s Cathedral, months after Pell was inaugurated as archbishop of Melbourne.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The suppression order covering the case was lifted by county court chief judge Peter Kidd this morning. Pell is due to be sentenced next week but may be taken into custody at a plea hearing tomorrow, having been out on bail since the verdict and recovering from knee surgery.</p>
<p>Pope Francis has yet to publicly react.</p>
<p>Pell walked from the Melbourne courtroom to a waiting car surrounded by a phalanx of police and press. He was jeered by survivors of sexual abuse who had gathered outside.</p>
<h2 id="md-youre-going-to-burn-in-hell.-burn-in-hell-pell-one-man-yelled.">“You’re going to burn in hell. Burn in hell, Pell,” one man yelled.</h2>
<p><strong>THE DEFENDANT</strong></p>
<p>Before returning to Australia to face the charges, Pell was for three years prefect of the secretariat for the economy of the Holy See, making him one of the most senior Catholics in the world. </p>
<p>He was one of Francis’s most trusted advisers, and was handpicked to oversee the Vatican’s complex finances and root out corruption.</p>
<p>On the day of the dramatic verdict, after a four-and-a-half-week trial, Pell stood in the dock showing no reaction and staring straight ahead. The room was silent as the foreman told the court that the jury had found the cardinal guilty on all charges. </p>
<p>Pell’s defence barrister, Robert Richter QC, when asked by journalists if he would appeal, responded: “Absolutely.”</p>
<p>Pell pleaded not guilty from the beginning. He was interviewed by a Victorian detective, Christopher Reed, in Rome in October 2016, and the video of that interview was played to the court. In that interview Pell described the allegations as “a load of garbage and falsehood”.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>When Reed said the attacks were alleged to have occurred after Sunday mass, Pell responded: “That’s good for me as it makes it even more fantastically impossible.”</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The jury took less than four days to reach their unanimous verdict.</p>
<h1 id="md-section"></h1>
<p><strong>THE SURVIVOR</strong></p>
<p>One of the complainants at the centre of the case, who cannot be named, asked for privacy in the wake of the suppression order being lifted, saying he was “a regular guy working to support and protect my family as best I can.”</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Like many survivors I have experienced shame, loneliness, depression and struggle,” he said in a statement.</p>
<p>“Like many survivors it has taken me years to understand the impact upon my life.</p>
<p>“At some point we realise that we trusted someone we should have feared and we fear those genuine relationships that we should trust. I would like to thank my family near and far for their support of me, and of each other.”</p>
</blockquote>
<h1 id="md-section-1"></h1>
<p><strong>THE ASSAULTS</strong></p>
<p><strong>The jury found that in the second half of December 1996, while he was archbishop of Melbourne, Pell walked in on two 13-year-old choirboys after a Sunday solemn mass at St Patrick’s Cathedral and sexually assaulted them.</strong></p>
<p>The complainant, who is now aged 35, said he and the other choirboy had separated from the choir procession as it exited the church building. The prosecution’s case hinged on his evidence, as the other victim died in 2014 after a heroin overdose. </p>
<p>After leaving the procession, the complainant said, he and the other boy sneaked back into the church corridors and entered the priest’s sacristy, a place they knew they should not be. </p>
<p>There they found some sacramental wine and began to drink. The complainant alleged that Pell had walked in on them and told them something to the effect that they were in trouble.</p>
<p>Pell manoeuvred his robes to expose his penis. He stepped forward, grabbed the other boy by the back of his head, and forced the boy’s head on to his penis, the complainant told the court.</p>
<p>Pell then did the same thing to the complainant, orally raping him. Once he had finished, he ordered the complainant to remove his pants, before fondling the complainant’s penis and masturbating himself. </p>
<p>The complainant alleged that either later that year in 1996, or in early 1997, Pell attacked him again. He said he was walking down a hallway to the choristers’ change room, again after singing at Sunday solemn mass at the cathedral, when Pell allegedly pushed him against the wall and squeezed his genitals hard through his choir robes, before walking off.</p>
<p>The complainant told the court that after the attacks he could not fathom what had happened to him and that he dealt with it by pushing it to the “darkest corners and recesses” of his mind.</p>

            whats odd about this is that the verdict was reported in December. I remember texting my ex wife to let her know bc Pell used to creep around her high school
           </p>
           <p>
            and now they make out like its some big revelation

             Yes, they reported it - illegally. There was a suppression order, which was only lifted this Tuesday. That's why all news outlets have reported now big style. (And also because he was sent to prison on Wednesday, of course.)

             Here's an article about the two boys he raped:

             I think it is as you suggested - imo he really is a pedo, but might have lost protection because he pissed some people off.

            The entire Catholic Church needs to burn.. however.. some points to be considered..
Pell was supposed to audit the Vatican Bank.. The last time the 'Bank' was supposed to be audited./. a pope died... 33 days after being invested. 
Churches and Banks..  You're running quickly into Blackfriars, P2 and hidden finincial systems running to Southern American non native with german accent people who have a shit load of twins with blue eyes and blond hair training insurgent rebels in Nicuragua to fight communism coming from Cuba..
When I first heard that Pell was going back to Australia, I thought it was for hiding tales of peedophilia.. I dont remember him being accused to begin with..He definately went down to protect the bank.. Its the bank that needs to be scoured clean..

            How are you concluding that I'm trying to read your mind? All I'm doing is responding to what you've said, which was clearly very irresponsible, resulting in a feeling of guilt, inferiority, or some combination of the two.

            You made a lazy ass assertion that some guy was "sacrificed" in place of the pope. In reality, a high profile pedo was dismantled and punished. You're clearly in the "nothing is happening crowd".

            But, he opposes intervention in Syria, which may have made him unpopular with the Kosher Nostra.

             Geez I wonder if Fiona Barnett's recent harassment and forced retreat from the internet are because of the uproar created from the recent ruling? Hmmm. Poor girl has been pushed around in so many horrible ways but this ruling confirms what she's been trying to tell people for years.

            In his role as treasurer, Pell found the vatican kike's hidden accounts and repatriated it back to the Vatican treasury.
Within 6 months he is being investigated for a trumped up child abuse charge that allegedly occurred 25 years ago and the corroborating witness had (((overdosed))) in 2014.

             Vatican finds hundreds of millions of euros 'tucked away', says Cardinal George Pell

            The Vatican's economy minister, Cardinal George Pell, has found hundreds of millions of euros "tucked away" in various Vatican accounts that did not appear on its balance sheets.
           </p>
           <p>
            The Australian cardinal wrote in Britain's Catholic Herald Magazine that the discovery meant overall finances were in better shape than previously believed.
           </p>
           <p>
            "In fact, we have discovered that the situation is much healthier than it seemed, because some hundreds of millions of euros were tucked away in particular sectional accounts and did not appear on the balance sheet," Cardinal Pell said.

            Circumstantial evidence from one boy from 25 years ago. It's a slippery slope to start convicting people based on such flimsy evidence.
This screams of Pell being a sacrificial lamb for Francis et al who I believe are genuine animals.

             That children (!) would have to 'just bite' someone who orally rapes them is a very odd hypothesis, to say the least.

             If an adult violently shoves his penis into a child's throat, the child is busy trying not to suffocate, 'biting' the cock is not an option. Sad that this needs to be explained.

                He was explicitly appointed to do the opposite and in doing his job found A BILLION FUCKING EURO stuffed in a mattress that he was about to disclose in the 2015 budget audit.
Then in 2015 he has a ridiculously far-fetched charge out of nowhere replete with cohencidences to answer for.
You fucking kikes better shut it down quick because it doesn't take too many aware of your kikery to wipe you from the earth for good.

                 Yes, appointed to do. AFTER OTHERS had already alerted the public about the scandal.

                 So in fact, he steered the Vatican's shady finances out of the public eye again -
                 <strong>
                  that's why he was appointed
                 </strong>
                 in the first place.
                </p>
                <p>
                 You really think the Vatican appoints an internal investigator, and he uncovers the true extent of the Vatican's crimes?

                  Keep the cohencidences coming, Hymie. Oy vey he was finding billions in just his first year as 
but there was really much more hidden away so he's automatically a gatekeeper pedo...
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  The truth is that he was clean, wouldn't be swayed to keep quiet about the kikes milking the Vatican Bank so they disposed of him.
It has been a kike media beat-up for three years. Nary a mention of the gross incidences of  corruption in the Vatican Bank that he had already uncovered.
Nope, that couldn't possibly be a mitigating factor in these fanciful charges being brought now. 
Anyone who knows the kike knows that this is their handiwork.

                     They're brainwashed, bud. Not worth it. They're just as bad as the Qews. They don't see that pedo accusations are weaponized by the pedos themselves, in order to obfuscate and cover their tracks. This is why they'll never find answers, while people like us are circling the X. They should be looking in to the accusers as well as the accusees.
