            These scumbags know what they are doing and that it is wrong.  Now they are in the hot seat and hoping they can escape the hammer slamming down on them.  I would like the hammer to slam down on something else,  if you know what I mean.  It is about time.  This guy seems to be an arrogant degenerate.  It couldn't happen to a more rotten guy.

            "Singer's production company - Bad Hat Harry - is also now vacating its offices on the lot of Twentieth Century Fox in the wake of his firing. He had a three-year first-look deal with the studio that ended in October, and an extension allowed the offices to remain during the Rhapsody shoot, according to THR.
           </p>
           <p>
            His publicist Simon Halls also said he stopped working for the director months ago. "

            "In November, a group of students at the University of Southern California demanded that Bryan Singer's name be removed from the film school.

            'We, the students of the USC School of Cinematic Arts, are formally requesting that Bryan Singer’s name be removed from our Division of Cinema and Media Studies,' reads the Change.org petition started by seven students from the school.
           </p>
           <p>
            'It is completely unacceptable that this prestigious department within our school still carries the name of Bryan Singer, a man accused multiple times of sexual harassment, assault, and pedophilia.' "
