            These scumbags know what they are doing and that it is wrong.  Now they are in the hot seat and hoping they can escape the hammer slamming down on them.  I would like the hammer to slam down on something else,  if you know what I mean.  It is about time.  This guy seems to be an arrogant degenerate.  It couldn't happen to a more rotten guy.

            "Singer's production company - Bad Hat Harry - is also now vacating its offices on the lot of Twentieth Century Fox in the wake of his firing. He had a three-year first-look deal with the studio that ended in October, and an extension allowed the offices to remain during the Rhapsody shoot, according to THR.
           </p>
           <p>
            His publicist Simon Halls also said he stopped working for the director months ago. "

            "In November, a group of students at the University of Southern California demanded that Bryan Singer's name be removed from the film school.

           <p>
            'We, the students of the USC School of Cinematic Arts, are formally requesting that Bryan Singerâ€™s name be removed from our Division of Cinema and Media Studies,' reads the Change.org petition started by seven students from the school.
           </p>
           <p>
            'It is completely unacceptable that this prestigious department within our school still carries the name of Bryan Singer, a man accused multiple times of sexual harassment, assault, and pedophilia.' "
