            The next thing you know, they will be making a movie in Hollywood about this, starring Kevin Spacey as himself.  The victim has come forward to say how much this disgraceful idea is extremely disgusting..
Sorry if I find this whole thing laughable, but when I was in high school, us folks in the theatre dept. were very familiar with the stories about Hollywood and the casting couch.  The fact that a successful actor is an in a state hubris and takes things too far is not surprising.  What is surprising is anyone is shocked by this shit.  It's been going on since the dawn of fame and glory.  The rich play the same game.  Everyone is using what they have to get what they want, except me, because I'm too ethical.

             In college, at least where I went, and even high school, only the least sensitive kids went to the Drama dept. parties. They were wild. Lots of bed sharing, male and female. Lots of wild behaviour. It went with the territory. And that was a long time ago.

            Interesting to see the male reaction -- 
and what he cites is one of the reasons why men don't talk about being sexually assaulted ....
it's "emasculating."

            there is no way in hell Hollywood got a moral compass all of a sudden, they are covering up for some very serious pedo/snuff crap that is about to hit the light of day- their handlers have given them permission, or they have been ordered to make the allegations.  And very big lawyers, are chomping at the bit to make money off the Hollywood elite willing to sell their fellow actor out as long as it keeps the wolves at bey.

             An Open Secret
.....JAMES GUNN speaks James Gunn October 22 at 12:11pm · Facebook Mentions ·
            </p>
            <p>
             When I lived in New York, in the 'nineties, this dude was EVERYWHERE. I have personally met at least FIFTEEN WOMEN, probably more, who say that he's accosted them in NYC. He essentially goes up to women and says, "Hey, I'm James Toback, and I'm a famous director, and I feel like there's a connection between us." Then he shows them some article on himself or some other artifact to prove he is who he is, and tries to get them to go somewhere else with him.
            </p>
            <p>
             He has done this to three girls I’ve dated, two of my very best friends, and a family member... twice. Yes, he came up to her twice with the same stupid line, not realizing she was the same person. This is in addition to many other women I've talked to at parties or dinners about their interactions with Toback.
            </p>
            <p>
             AND THAT'S JUST PEOPLE I KNOW. It’s not even mentioning the many other accounts going all the way back to an article that came out in SPY magazine in 1989 detailing this behavior, and I’m not including all the people I’ve talked to online who’ve had experiences. I mean, statistically, it would seem his numbers would have to be at least in the thousands.
            </p>
            <p>
             Most of these women were in their early twenties. Most of them refused to go any further with him, but a few went to dinner, or to some sort of casting situation, or to someplace private.
            </p>
            <p>
             And, honestly, if the stories were just about some crazed sex addict who approaches thousands of women on the street trying to get laid, I wouldn't be posting this now. I don't want to be attacking every Hollywood douchebag who hits on countless women. That type of behavior isn’t cool, but I think it’s important to separate douchebaggery from any kind of sexual coercion. But the women I talked to who DID go someplace private with Toback, told stories that were worse than the women only accosted on the street.
            </p>
            <p>
             It’s important to say, I don’t have any firsthand information about any of this. But the stories are so eerily similar, and I’ve heard them again and again from some of the people I trust most in the world, I know the chances of them being untrue… well, it would just be impossible. I knew it was their choice whether or not they wanted to come forward publicly, but I let them know I would have their backs if they did.
            </p>
            <p>
             So I did what I could do in my impotent state – for over twenty years now, I’ve been bringing up James Toback every chance I could in groups of people. I couldn’t stop him, but I could warn people about him.
            </p>
            <p>
             Recently, I thought the guy had disappeared into obscurity and old age, but then I saw an article in the Huffington Post about him, entitled, "James Toback Gets Us, He Truly Gets Us." I almost vomited. Did the person who wrote the article even do a basic Google search on Toback? It seemed like he was more current than I had thought, with a movie at the Venice Film Festival starring Sienna Miller. I had hoped his exploits had become well known enough that producers wouldn’t finance his films and actors wouldn't work with him.
            </p>
            <p>
             So since then I’ve been hoping the Weinstein/O'Reilly stuff would bring this vampire into the light (him and a couple others, frankly). So I was happy today to wake up to this story in the LA Times.
            </p>
            <p>
             I told the women who would come forward I had their back. This is me doing my best to fulfill that promise.
            </p>
            <p>
             Love to you all.
            </p>
            <p>
             Addendum to the first post:
            </p>
            <p>
             A few people on here, Twitter, and other sites are saying, "James, why didn't you say anything if you knew this was happening?"
            </p>
            <p>
             A) Like I said above, I did say something, many times, to many people, all over the world.
            </p>
            <p>
             B) More importantly, I have publicly written Facebook posts about Toback and what he was doing, as well as mentioning him on my web site and on MySpace. I don't know why suddenly people are just assuming I didn't just because I don't mention it here.
            </p>
            <p>
             C) That said, I put myself in legal jeopardy doing so, and I'm not sure I would do the same today. If I actually SAW something, it would be a different story. But simply sharing secondhand stories is legally complicated, and could open me to being sued. It is necessary that firsthand accounts come out to get these stories noticed, whether it's from the victim or someone else who witnesses what's occurring.

             I have been wondering the same thing vindicator. I think there is more to this than we understand at this point and may not understand until later. That often happens when these things break, it takes time. The reason I think there is more behind this is the way it broke. The New York times practically led with it just as it broke. It was almost as if part of the community was aware and preparing for it. I assumed the New York Times etc...would just do their usual covering job but they didn't. They actually reported it.
            </p>
            <p>
             Part of me thinks they might have sensed that enough people were becoming aware of it that they needed to get in front of it and control the dialogue. So far that might possibly have some merit as almost all of it has been confined to "inappropriate" sexual advances by adults toward adults, which is the best of all worlds for them. There has been just a small number of allegations of messing with minors that conveniently for them happened many years ago.
            </p>
            <p>
             The statute of limitations may have run out on the majority of these incidents. Maybe they planned it this way and plan to ride it like this until it burns itself out.
            </p>
            <p>
             There is TONS of active child abuse in that nest every day and nobody has yet come out said, "ok, here is a list of 35 names of children that we know are being abused every day, right now, yesterday, today, and will be tomorrow. These are the people doing it to the children too." That is the big dangerous secret right there. Nobody will tolerate that if it gets out. So far it has been kept quiet. I'm sure the people involved with child abuse are being kept on a very tight leash right now. Probably being watched, handled, paid off, and threatened daily.
            </p>
            <p>
             This shit storm will pass at some point, just like the shit storm of 911 and so many false flags and other known atrocities. If it passes without the child slaves being exposed, at some point in the future, we will eventually probably understand why and how that happened. I feel quite sure that is the goal.

              The other thing that makes no sense is the fact that we have the shit hitting the fan over and over again -- every other damn week! Two hurricanes. Horrific wildfires. Terror attacks, including Vegas. Kim Jong Ding Dong. The EU falling apart. Horrific corruption revelations daily... and yet barely a blip in the markets. Totally unfazed. The Big Money isn't perturbed by any of these crises or their potential impact on the spending of regular folks that drives the economy.
             </p>
             <p>
              Ten years ago, we'd have had a market crash over any two of these. It makes no sense.

                What's most bizarre about the markets is that there is a HUGE demographic pressure against them -- I think there are something like 64 million Boomers who are in the midst of retiring. I read something like 10,000 a day for the next ten years. That will have a gigantic impact on spending as the move into fixed income living. You'd think the stock market would tank as they moved away from risk and into yield. Especially with all the terrible headlines. But it's not happening. I don't get it.

            I’m an ESL teacher. I was having a conversation with one of my students about actors and movies a few years ago. It was a memorable conversation. I had asked her if she’d seen some movie that’d become popular with the students. She replied that she’d never been to a movie because she doesn’t like live action movies. When I asked why she explained that she believed that acting is the highest form of lying. She elaborated. She thought that if we all get used to seeing lies we won’t know how to tell the difference between lie and truth. She talked about how movie stars usually ended up being exposed as criminals or embroiled in scandals. - There really is no substitute for the mind of a child. Clarity of vision perhaps? - We argued playfully about it as a class that day but in the wake of all these scandals and they things, it has come to mind ringing as true.
           </p>
           <p>
            The TV/  it Screen really is the worst. It is definitely a passive programming device. ... and I mean, if hi I about what has to take place psychologically for one to maintain a role or character for months while filming a movie. Now repeat that over and over. These minds and bodies barely have enough room for one. I’d imagine that a lot of the dark and twisted things would that average people have to wrestle with and sort out throughout their lives gets pushed to the back or even mislabeled as belonging to one of their fictitious characters. I’m suddenly reminded of episodes like Christian Bale, David Hasslehoff, Charlie Sheen, etc - it just seems like, when there’s a break in the exterior of these people, This nasty toxic sludge bursts forth as if some kind of damn has broken. They’re able to scrape it all up and duck tape the wall back temporarily, but eventually too many people have witnessed it for there to be any more pretending.

            Spacey’s bullshit coming out/deflection is just another botched duck taping of his secret double life as a predator lacking any kind of self reflection or accountability.

             I will say this; watching Hollywood actors portray villains, murderers, drug addicts and so forth has to have had some affect on the average person’s understanding of evil.  In real life, there is often something visibly wrong with evil people (usually it’s in their eyes).  Actors are all pretty nice people, and they thus lack all the other tells.  People watching lose that entire dimension of understanding, and I think it fills the ability to recognize it in real life.

             I've seen many people online commenting that they 'like Kevin Spacey and he's such a great actor' and so they don't see what all the fuss is about.  That's the problem..that people who invest in celebrity culture and become emotionally attached to the media face of these actors will not use logic when faced with facts.  That is why organisations like the United Nations and big charities and NGOs like to use celebrities to front their endeavours.  People buy into the fantasy.

              Well said. They are definitely using star power to shove their sick agendas down everybody's throat. I mean the Gay / Transgender thing has been shoved down everybody's throats for the last few years. - I could give two shits about what homosexual adults do in their private time. But children? - FUCK NO. The normalization of pedophilia is real. It's here, and we all have answer this with a firm. NOPE, NEVER, TRY IT AND DIE, attitude. THIS FAR - NO FURTHER! (Yes, read it as Picard would say it.)

             I think acting can cause you to lose touch with your sense of self, a part of this being your morality, or even fail to develop one if you start very young and have no strong, moral parental figures in your life - the Peter Sellers biopic highlights this well. De Niro seems like another empty shell

            I want someone, one of the abused, to come forward and disclose how they were brought to a politician on order.  We know this exists, because Shirley Temple Black talked about being abused at the Studios and then being made available for HK and others.  It is time.

              So the article I read was months ago, if I find it will send.  I remember that someone wrote about her being passed around as well especially to HK.  So here is the email that was also featured in that article:
              <a href="http://www.thedailysheeple.com/henry-kissinger-shirley-temple-and-mk-ultra_022014">
               http://www.thedailysheeple.com/henry-kissinger-shirley-temple-and-mk-ultra_022014
              </a>
              Now I have always felt that email was released for a reason and what it implies between ST and HK  is very telling.

               Geez, I forgot about her ambassador appointment/so sure, she just might have been mk ultra'ed.  Being put in a black box with a block of ice is just SO WRONG ON EVERY LEVEL.  Where in the hell was her mom????????????????????????????????  Or rather, what part did her mom have in marketing her daughter just like Brooke Shields.

            From the victim:
'I put my hand down and turned his thumb back to get his hand off it,' Montana said.
           </p>
           <p>
            'I paid for my drink and got away from him.'
           </p>
           <p>
            But Montana says that the actor then followed him to the bathroom.
           </p>
           <p>
            'I backed him out the door and I pushed him,' he says.
           </p>
           <p>
            'One of his friends was in line and I said, "It’s time to take your boy home".
           </p>
           <p>
            'They all ended up leaving.'
           </p>
           <p>
            Montana, who was in his thirties at the time of the incident, says the encounter was the last time he saw Spacey.
           </p>
           <p>
            'I never talked to anyone about it except for therapists,' he tells Radar.
           </p>
           <p>
            'I had PTSD for six months after. It was an emasculating thing for someone to do to me. Whenever I went to the bar I would see if he was there or have my back against the wall.'
           </p>
