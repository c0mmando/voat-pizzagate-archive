            As posted yesterday, the Art in Embassies program is tied to secret societies and was started in Racine, Wisconsin. Racine is a main root of the entire system of Pizzagate and Global Criminal Corruption.

             The Art in Embassies Program is INTERNATIONAL.  It was begun by President Kennedy and is funded by the U.S. State Department.  The White House is NOT in Racine, Wisconsin!
            </p>
            <p>
             The Art In Embassies Program (AIEP) is a public-private partnership that promotes cultural diplomacy through exhibitions, permanent collections, site-specific commissions and two-way artist exchanges in more than 200 U.S. Embassies and Consulates around the world.[1] Through art, international audiences gain a sense of the quality, scope, and diversity of American and host country art and culture.
             <strong>
              <strong>
               Initiated by President John Kennedy in 1963, the program is funded by the U.S. Department of State
              </strong>
             </strong>
             .[2] Virginia Shore is the Chief Curator.[3]

              Again you are proven wrong, and every time you fail to respond. Why won't you investigate Racine? Do you even want to solve Pizzagate and Global Criminal Corruption or are you trying to deflect the real truth and a main root of the entire network?
             </p>
             <p>
              Art in Embassies began in direct coordination with SC Johnson based in Racine, Wisconsin.
             </p>
             <p>
              "In addition to continuing its support of individual exhibits of American art to foreign nations, the USIA and the Department of State also embarked on new programs designed to acquaint the world with American painting. One new initiative involved working more closely with U.S. businesses that owned large art collections in order to facilitate their exhibition overseas. More spectacularly, the State Department established the Art in Embassies program in 1964, which sought to turn U.S. embassies into small art galleries."
             </p>
             <p>
              "In 1962, Edward R. Murrow, who was then director of the USIA, proclaimed a 'new and, I think, significant development' in terms of art patronage in the United States. This was the 'increasing interest of large corporations - Big Business as an institution, as opposed to the big businessman as an individual - in giving financial backing to our performing and creative arts.' As the 'interpreter of America to the rest of the world', Murrow was particularly excited by this development. 'The mere fact that profit-motivated corporations in a price-directed economy find good reason to subsidize the arts speaks eloquently against those who see in our system only the grossest materialism.'
             </p>
             <p>
              "HE WAS PARTICULARLY EXCITED ABOUT THE OFFER BY S.C. JOHNSON &amp; SON, INC. (THE FLOOR WAX GIANT) TO SEND ITS LARGE COLLECTION OF CONTEMPORARY AMERICAN ART AROUND THE WORLD, SPONSORED BY USIA."
