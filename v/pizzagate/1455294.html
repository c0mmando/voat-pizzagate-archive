            spreading awareness will eventually make a difference. Once critical mass is achieved i believe there will be good people in the agencies in power that will have a large enough backing to do something. Im also sure there are many in positions that can have an effect that didnt know this existed ...until now. Mass awareness is the key. Keep up the fight.

            The next step is getting the media to talk about this for real. When the majority of the population knows the truth, we will see change. Right now, they are still trying to cover this up, but it's a clusterfuck. They are scrambling and making mistake after mistake. They see us as a threat, but they are their own biggest enemy.
           </p>
           <p>
            The media WILL talk about this. Because it will not go away. Too many people know about this.

             I agree.... we need to continue to discredit them, make them lose advertising and revenue until they cant take it anymore and start talking to increase their bottom line. Keep up exposing them as the LIARS they are. Stay vigilant and relentless , do not let up for a minute.,

            I can tell you that much of the info that has been found thus far has given many out there info needed to make connections that were not apparent.
           </p>
           <p>
            I was heavily trafficked and molested as a child, and saw the inner workings of the high up Hollywood / DC child trafficking and pornography network. I have been obtaining evidence into my own case, and some of the people involved in it are involved in Pizzagate. I will leave it at that for now.
           </p>
           <p>
            The smoking gun can be obtained if Wikileaks gets information RE individuals that are named in Pizzagate. That or if hackers can obtain info on individuals involved in Pizzagate. I can guarantee you FBI is looking into this and everything that comes out in this will continue to help connect the dots.
           </p>
           <p>
            The more info we can accumulate, the better chance we have at finding the smoking gun.

             I also believe witness testimony may ultimately be the smoking gun but i can see any potential witnesses being too afraid to come forward at this point. I think once we have some court cases progressing the witnesses will flowing in like crazy.

              Agreed. MSM has done their best to ignore Pizzagate, and some even calling it fake news.
I am disappointed Breitbart is not covering the story like they did when it first came out. Reddit's censorship is very alarming as well..

              Any victim would be very intimidated to come forward now in this environment.

             I don't think you account of Getting the Jews is creditable. I've been investigating (on the side) Zionist. Which can be anyone. Jews don't have to be Zionist and Zionist don't have to be Jews.

            I think the folks who are loosely leading the investigation (you will know yourselves) should keep next steps close to their chest and move to speaking using encryption. There are lots of us who would love to think we are helping but really we are not. We seem close. Let the techy annons among us carve the next steps because they know how to secure themselves and important information. Thats just my thoughts however.

             The problem with techy anons is that we cannot confirm they are MIA, compromised, or whatnot. Making it much more difficult verify anything.

             I'm not saying everyone should out themselves. Obviously, stay safe. That's the most important part.
