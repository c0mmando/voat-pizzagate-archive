I was just reading the executive summary and the full FBI Anon postings and I saw that he mentioned the code word CARDS as a term to describe the child abudction rapid deployment system that is used by the FBI. He said some of the code words are too nefarious for us to even imagine. SO since I haven\'t seen any talk of this before on Pizzagate I decided to do a quick search on wikileaks and sure enough here is an email referencing cards that seems to be codespeak. People - have you seen this one yet and do you know what this is about?</p>

              Glad you agree with my suspicions. I hope more people will start looking up the code words mentioned by FBI anon, I am limited on time but I did see a video today where the guy talking interpreted walnuts as the way a little girl's genitals swell up when she has been raped. And the map (hankerchief) he thinks is how they keep a memento. Who knows with these freaks but it feels like we have a long way to go before we uncover everything.

               i have to go recheck but i'm pretty sure - i find it odd how this thread isn't even on the first page and i know, i know there are many threads made daily but i'm seeing that their must be a lot of paid shills because most of the good info is on page 3 and beyond. page 1 and 2 will have some good info but i always check on the time of the posting to see if it's a fresh post or an old post purposely being upvoated to kick off the good threads into further pages. sorry for going a bit off topic it's just for myself and others i'm sure are also realizing this. Also it's so disgusting when we find out this new info (your comment about walnut) because we don't suspect these words of having other meanings because we're not satanic pedophile cannibals etc.

                Yeah I agree with you, we need more people to look into these code words. I just stumbled on it and I was wondering if anything was learned in the past on these particular ones by all the researchers before I even found out about Voat. I hadn't read the FBI Anon stuff at all until a few days ago, I imagine some researchers are more passive and not going to look at the original sources or at the emails on Wikileaks.

            Also, does Tony Podesta even look or seem like someone who would ever carry a backpack? Do you know any Multi-millionaires who carry backpacks? If he did, why would he leave it with his brother? Why would he have "presumably" business cards in the "top front pouch" of a BACKPACK? Does he prefer a backpack over a briefcase? Is this an eccentric quirk?

            Sotheby's is an Auction House, so this could be code for auction cards. In other words, pics of kids who are up for auction. Not saying Sotheby's is involved at all.

             Someone should look into every organization that any of these people came from, especially any one that works with children. The first thing I noticed on her website was that they go work with pregnant women and newborns in the Congo - seems like a great place to steal children from and tell the women that their babies died.

               Well I was talking about all the people on this williamsworks website. But the list would / could include anyone linked to Podesta or the Clinton Foundation. When I posted my original post here, I was just thinking that the email might be coded language but didn't really know. The second that I saw this williamsworks website posted here in the comments and I went to it I started looking at the people listed on the team for her organization. Any time I see a major international effort being made and I see that someone came to her from a CPS type of position, it makes me very suspicious. I'd bet that something is not good if your team comes from CPS and goes into some org linked to Podesta.

           <blockquote>
            <p>
             In the almost 14 months of doing this I discovered crooked cops, low life search team people, low life private investigators, oppression by law enforcement, cover up by law enforcement and a crap load of other stuff. I am alone, doing this myself, no help. Only inuput and ideas from others, including nutball killers sitting behind bars. Local media is shut down by FBI agent Richard Rennison who just happened to work for League City PD during the abductions and investigations. Like putting a fox in a hen house right?

               Well I guess some people prefer anonymity but I've been speaking out on things for over 10 years and anonymity isn't exactly an option for me anymore. If Hillary Clinton can go flaunt her love for abortion then I can flaunt my hatred for child sacrifice.
