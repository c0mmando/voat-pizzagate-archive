<p><em>Pope Benedict XVI attends a concert by the Domspatzen choir with his brother Georg Ratzinger at the Sistine Chapel in the Vatican on October 22, 2005</em></p>
<hr />
<p>The Domspatzen, a 1,000-year-old choir in Regensburg, Bavaria, was dragged into the massive sexual abuse scandal plaguing the Catholic Church in 2010, when allegations of assaults that took place several decades ago went public.</p>
<p>The choir was run by Pope Benedict\'s elder brother, Georg Ratzinger, from 1964 to 1994 when most of the claimed abuses took place.</p>
<p>Lawyer Ulrich Weber, who had been commissioned by the diocese to look into the cases, said at a press conference that his research, which included 70 interviews with victims, uncovered abuse that took place from 1945 to the early 1990s.</p>
<p>Their was 231 reports of physical abuse.</p>
<p>These ranged from sexual assault to rape, severe beatings and food deprivation.</p>
<p>&quot;50 victims spoke of ten perpetrators&quot;.</p>
<p>The director and composer Franz Wittenbrink, a former pupil of the boarding school, had told Spiegel magazine in 2010 that there was an &quot;system of sadistic punishments connected to sexual pleasure&quot;.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jan/08/lawyer-231-boys-german-choir-school-abuse-victims-regensburger-domspatzen">German scandal</a> is one of several to have rocked the Catholic Church in recent years, notably in <a href="http://www.irishtimes.com/news/crime-and-law/brendan-smyth-may-have-abused-more-than-200-children-1.2258487">Ireland</a> where one priest admitted sexually abusing more than 100 children.</p>
<p>Several German institutions have also been engulfed by the scandal, including an elite Jesuit school in Berlin which had admitted to systematic sexual abuse of pupils by two priests in the 1970s and 1980s. <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jan/08/lawyer-231-boys-german-choir-school-abuse-victims-regensburger-domspatzen">theguardian.com</a></p>
<p>Most of the priests concerned did not face criminal charges, because the alleged crimes took place too long ago.</p>
<p>But there had been calls for a change in the law and for the church to pay compensation to victims.</p>
<p>In February 2015, the Regensburg diocese had said there were 72 victims of abuse, and had offered compensation of 2,500 euros each.</p>

            These are the true Wolf in Sheeps clothing Jesus warned about. Sad, just sad all those innocent little children. Wish there were something that would affect pedophiles where, if they went to touch a child, they would just fizzle up and disappear like smoke!  That would save the children and at the same time save us the job of 'cleaning up the scumbags after we annihilate them'!  Come on JUSTICE...we are waiting for you to finally catch up with them!

            No, some "compensation" is an insult. Burning at the stake is what these maggots need. There is literally nothing lower than representing Jesus and Christianity for the purpose of raping children. These scum need to be killed. There  is no other way.

            I'm a Catholic, but I see that my Church has been utterly corrupted by satanist scum, all the way to the top (obviously "pope" francis the freemason).

            It's time for a New Inquisition. This is the same thing that caused the first one, and the same people behind it.

            There have to be changes in the Statutes of Limitation on reporting sexual abuse that occurred in childhood and 
particularly if by an institution such as the RCC and by its pedophile priests.
           </p>
           <p>
            The entire RCC worldwide should be registered as a Pedophile Zone.

            It doesn't take an individual with super-charged mental powers to see that ALL religions are compromised. The damage done to society by bad habits and loose morality's is nothing compared to the damage done to society by the self righteous violence committed in the name of the state.

            Two medical changes to get to the bottom of the mind of these pervs. End circumcision it will probably take a generation or two of the miasma to fade some but there is a terrible corruption to an infant right there. I found that the fewest of these are performed in Western Europe which I find interesting considering they have not awakened to defending their women folk. I don't know what's happened there. 
Then the issue of Csection births. Yes certainly there are some necessary ones but definitely not habitually unless the drugs they are taking for prenatal or the gmo's etc. have made this s.o.p. It has to stop. Witness the snowflake safe space conundrum. How many elites get cesarian birth delivery? Don't they have heated pools to birth in? Yes, they do.

              Oh dear. I don't think so but now that you mention it. Salt water certainly. You never see pictures of bloody water. Here's a treasurable video with midwives I think.

                Right, not that mother. And I refuse to see if there is a video of the placenta coming out in the water. Which was baby's source of nourishment and the whole you know, gateway into a fork in that road.

             Very happy to see you mention Circumcision which is nothing but a physical assault on an infant male.
And there is absolutely no reason for it.
            </p>
            <p>
             Came upon some astonishing stuff in regard to Cicumcision recently --
             <a href="https://search.yahoo.com/search;_ylc=X3oDMTFiaHBhMnJmBF9TAzIwMjM1MzgwNzUEaXRjAzEEc2VjA3NyY2hfcWEEc2xrA3NyY2hhc3Q-?p=rabbis+suck+blood+at+circumcision&amp;fr=yfp-t-s&amp;fp=1&amp;toggle=1&amp;cop=mss&amp;ei=UTF-8">
              https://search.yahoo.com/search;_ylc=X3oDMTFiaHBhMnJmBF9TAzIwMjM1MzgwNzUEaXRjAzEEc2VjA3NyY2hfcWEEc2xrA3NyY2hhc3Q-?p=rabbis+suck+blood+at+circumcision&amp;fr=yfp-t-s&amp;fp=1&amp;toggle=1&amp;cop=mss&amp;ei=UTF-8
             </a>
            </p>
            <p>
             And, agree, there is no reason for the constantly rising rates of Cesarean deliveries.  Young women in the USA are even making appointments for their Cesareans which makes clear the brain-washing they are getting from the medical industry.
Cesareans involve major surgery on the body of females.  The entire concept of pre-natal care of pregnant females by males is in itself unbalanced, inane.  We need to return childbirth to the care of midwives.

              I know, your link is deeply disturbing. I have been tweeting my opinion for about a year. It started with FGM and the more I thought about it I realized how corrupting to a functional soul's health - male female any age. But when I tweet to end it, someone always comes and tells me about the fight these Rabbis had with NY and that it's religion, blahblahblah. Not sure if its always the same person who responds or if there's a group minding the store so to speak. I think it makes the whole dang jewish question more suspect than ever. I imagine a better future where these practices will be in the dust bin along with syphilis, gonorrhea, venereal disease. Sadly, cesarian births need to be researched for autism, for safe spaces, for everything happening that seems bizarre to youth today. What was their birth like and are they circumcised. Graduate students, will medical schools allow such a real tangible quest for understanding?The brainwashed mothers have the Feminist movement to thank for their corruption I bet.

               If you bothered to look at the link, you would see that circumcision becomes oral sex -- i.e., sexual abuse of an infant.
Additionally, I did not introduce the subject of circumcision, the poster I was replying to did.

            I, for one, liked Pope Benedict.  He was very conservative. I don't know whether these rumors are true or not. Who knows what is true.  I tend to think that many liberal Catholics, including the leadership at the Vatican, which is not the same as the Pope, did not like Benedict and threatened him with these rumors in order to remove him. In the same manner they are trying to smear Trump with "Russia, Russia, Russia".   One thing that I  find strange in all these accusations against priests, bishops, etc., is that they always come out when a conservative Pope, Bishop, Cardinal is in charge. It is their way to remove the ones they don't like by sacrificing some of their own.  It goes on for years, but is only brought to light when a conservative is in charge.  There was a book written about how liberals infiltrated the Catholic Church with gays and pedophiles in a planned effort to bring it down, creating their own "deep state of corruption".
            <br/>
            The book was "Goodbye Good Men: How Liberals brought corruption into the Catholic Church".

             Don't know if I agree with "liberals" being responsible for bring down the Catholic Church.  A better description might be Jewish Freemasons, if this article is to be believed.  Freemasonry, Rosicrucians, Knights Templar and other secret societies seem very much at the heart of Pizzagate.

             His "conservatism" was phony, unfortunately. Look up the "alta vendita" to learn of the plans freemasons made to infiltrate the Church, all the way back in the early 1800s. They've obviously got their man as the pope now.

             If you don't know what's true about the RCC and its priests now with all of this evidence before you, I don't imagine you ever will.
Where is there evidence that sexual abusers of children and murderers of children are "liberals"?
Rather, LIBERAL Pope John XXIII who worked to make the church a democracy with Vatican II -- and who told Catholics to use their own personal conscience to decide for themselves whether or not to use contraceptives -- was likely murdered.  The two Popes who followed him (LIBERALS) seem to have also been murdered by a right-wing cult within the Vatican, likely because they too were supporting artificial contraceptives.
            </p>
            <p>
             The RCC has been involved with the sexual abuse of children for more than 2000 years - "from day #1" as the Italians tell us.
            </p>
            <p>
             The underlying concept of the RCC is male-supremacy -- women, homosexuals, Jews, Africans are among their long list of enemies.  You think male-supremacy is "liberal"?
            </p>
            <p>
             Papal Edicts encouraged genocide vs the Native American here in their instructions to "enslave or kill" them.
Same for the Africans already being enslaved here.
             <br/>
             Do you see systems of slavery in any way being "LIBERAL"?

             I agree, by consigning Jews to all the worlds problems is politically dangerous and does nothing in the name of justice. Such accusations can lead to terrible oppression for masses of innocent people.

            I second that. It has and probably always will. I have this weird notion that the elites have a supply of young sex slaves in their elite bunkers at all times in case of a

             Agree -- why would any parent agree to have their children involved with any male-supremacist religion???

             Catholic Church/Vatican even today still does not recognize the full personhood of females as it recognizes the full personhood of males.  For a thousand years and more they preached hatred for Jews from their altars, as well as hatred to Homosexuals as an "obomination."
             <br/>
             Also time that the Church's hatred and war on females also be ended.

             Why it is so low is because the church knows if they paid any reasonable sum, there would be 1000x more claims. Few people are willing to expose them to their childhood terrors for such a paltry sum. Not to mention the pain and feelings of guilt to the victims and their close ones.

             Then there is of course the things the church's lawyers will say about your character. Take for example what the hillary clinton said when she was

                Yes, was just trying to figure out the legal side of these heinous acts.
               </p>
               <p>
                Personally, all who commit these acts, or hide the perpetrators from justice are equally guilty of most heinous of crimes: betrayal.
               </p>
               <p>
                Whole catholic church should be burned for this, perpetrators crucified all the way up, and including, the pope. They deserve this. Trying to hide all of this like they are trying to do speaks loud for their character and moral values. This is pure evil. The kind you read from the bible. They have tainted the whole Christian faith with their deeds and will bleed for this forever.

               Vatican is protected and so are the Royals.  But when the news comes out, I wonder if  some of those British people that still support the Royals will just stick their heads back up there blooming bottoms.

              I posted several of these about Pope Francis, got over 100 downvoats within a few hours, on all my posts going back to when I first signed up on voat. It took me three weeks, to get enough upvoats to post more than 10 posts a day😠
Pretty sure it was not catholics who did this. So someone was triggered.
