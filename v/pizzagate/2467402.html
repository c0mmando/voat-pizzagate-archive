<p>This comes in the wake of the Telford grooming scandal, which could have seen as many as 1,000 girls abused during a 40 year period – Westmonster went to the scene and spoke to people who say the abuse is still going on.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Further, there\'s a weird thing going on with this article. I\'m assuming it\'s written and managed by people on our side and trying to help. But even though they are, they\'re COVERING UP WHAT\'S GOING ON! How? By repeating BULL SHIT NARRATIVES! </p>
<p>First, look at the seven men\'s names:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Assad Hussain, 37, of Iffley Road, Oxford, guilty of five counts of rape and two counts of indecent assault, not guilty of one count of indecent assault.</li>
<li>Kameer Iqbal, 39, of Dashwood Road, Oxford, guilty of three counts of rape.</li>
<li>Khalid Hussain, 38, of Ashhurst Way, Oxford, guilty of rape and indecent assault, not guilty of one count of rape.</li>
<li>Kamran Khan, 36, of Northfield Road, Bolton, guilty of indecent assault and false imprisonment, not guilty of rape.</li>
<li>Moinul Islam, 41, of Wykeham Crescent, Oxford, guilty of rape, two counts of indecent assault and supplying cannabis, not guilty of false imprisonment.</li>
<li>Raheem Ahmed, 40 of Starwort Path, Oxford, guilty of two counts of indecent assault and false imprisonment, not guilty of rape.</li>
<li>Alladitta Yousaf, 48, of Bodley Road, Oxford, guilty of indecent assault.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Now look at what the article says: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>The true scale of child sexual abuse carried out by these Asian grooming gangs is absolutely shocking – </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Again: </p>
<h1>ASIAN GROOMING GANGS?!!!!</h1>
<p>Look at the pics!!! Read the names!!! Those names are not Asian!!!! So why in hell is this article repeating the narrative that it\'s Asian gangs?!!!! If an Asian gang is behind this, then where are their names? It\'s obvious that even if there were Asians involved, they\'d at least have had to join forces with the ethnicity represented here! And THEY\'RE NOT ASIAN!!!! </p>
<p>Here\'s more: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>men have been found guilty of running a sick child sex ring in Oxford in the latest grooming scandal to hit the UK.</p>
<p>Child sexual exploitation was taking place on a massive scale, with 5 victims aged between 13 and 15-years-old suffering years of abuse – these were vulnerable young girls who’d often be plied with drink and drugs before being repeatedly raped.</p>
<p>The men raped girls inside a vehicle they called the ‘shag wagon’…</p>
<p>Speaking about one of the victims, the prosecutor said in court: “She says she has lost count of the number of ‘uncles’ she had sex with… After sex she would sit in the shower and scrub herself.”</p>

             It's why people really have to get involved and not take this shit anymore. When you see it happen, post about it. That's it. Videotape it and force officials to take action. They can't arrest everyone -- although I'm sure they'd like to.

            oh my god you are so ignorant, woman.  and i'm not saying you don't know what continent Pakistan is on.  i'm saying even after reading so many UK publications you haven't caught on to the factoid that, having no gooks, japs, or chinks, ASIANS means INDO-PAKIS.
           </p>
           <p>
            Since you're a naive woman, I bet you buy the story that the cops were 'afraid of being called racist'.  Were that true, not only would the cops be unbelievably selfish traitors, but their reluctance was a direct result of the PC atmosphere exclusively cultivated by Jews.

           <p>
            In reality the whole idea of importing muslims and covering up their brutal crimes is part of a multi-decade psyop called the (((clash of civilizations))) designed to convince people like you that Israel is a vital ally against dangerous muslims, an underdog, etc.
           </p>
           <p>
            Finally the only reason you have Pakistanis or niggers (who, in the US, rape a white woman every 12 minutes) is because of Jews:

            <p>
             As the guardian of Britain’s border security, Blair chose as Lunior Immigration Minister a woman who seemed to retain an acute sense of her own Jewishness while having a great enthusiasm for eradicating White British identity.
Roche, a staunch enthusiast for all things LGBT, is the daughter of a Polish-Russian Ashkenazi father and Sephardic Spanish-Portugese mother.  She told The Independent “My being Jewish informs me totally, informs my politics. I understand the otherness of ethnic groups.” In 1994 she had been one of the many Jewish MPs who had backed an extreme anti-White measure to increase sentences for crimes where race was deemed to be an aggravating factor

             If you could translate this to English and stop with the inflammatory terms, I'll read what you have to say.

             But I won't read it in this form.

              guess what, adults don't have any "right" to be told truth in a certain manner they prefer.  and neither do women.
