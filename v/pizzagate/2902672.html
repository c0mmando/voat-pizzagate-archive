<p>NPH, also known as Friends of the Orphans, is the charity that Laura Silsby legal advisor <a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/2043070">Jorge Puello told Greta van Sustren</a> was the source of the &quot;orphans&quot; she was arrested for trafficking out of Haiti. NPH runs &quot;family homes&quot; for orphans, supported by &quot;godparents&quot; recruited via international dance performance tours put on by the kids. When on tour, the performers stay in the homes of local volunteers and perform in various churches in each city they visit. Godparents can also come visit their &quot;godchildren&quot; in their NPH orphanage.</p>

</ul>
<p>NPH has other pizzagate connections than the Silsby trafficking scandal in Haiti, though. <a href="https://voat.co/u/redberries">@redberries</a> <a href="https://archive.fo/wnmYA">discovered</a> Max Maccoby, Director of Friends of the Orphans, also represented James Alefantis and David Brock in their $850,000 blackmail case. There are many more intertwined connections described in this Steemit post: <a href="https://steemit.com/pizzagate/@heroic15397/alefantis-friends-of-the-orphans-and-the-maccoby-family">https://steemit.com/pizzagate/@heroic15397/alefantis-friends-of-the-orphans-and-the-maccoby-family</a>.</p>
<p>NPH was also involved, along with Max\'s dad Dr. Michael Maccoby, in mind control research, <a href="https://rense.com/general96/pizza10.htm">according to Yoichi Shimatsu</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Attorney Max inherited his board seat at Friends of the Orphans from his father Dr. Michael Maccoby, a psychoanalyst who recently accused Donald Trump of being a “narcissist”. Dr. Maccoby conducted a research project on NPH orphans group with Erich Fromm, and at Harvard worked with the determinist psychiatrist B.F. Skinner and policymaker McGeorge Bundy. The early-age psychological conditioning theories of Skinner and Fromm were a part of the Tavistock mind-control program, the blueprint for MK-ULTRA. Conditioning exercises were the lesser-known practical techniques used in the CIA brainwashing project, which was founded on Freudian trauma theory.</p>

<hr />
<p>So, Arnold Beezer, S.J. who was reported for sexually abusing a minor in the 1970s according to the Western Jesuits\' report, spent two years (1994-1996) stationed at an NPH orphanage. No details available about that, and the report does not say what year the allegations were made; only that he was removed from ministry. </p>
<p>I did dig up the fact that he is very <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/19990210172040/http://users.ethergate.com/arnieb/">interested in his family geneology and has written multiple books about it</a> and also currently <a href="https://archive.fo/2xDQ1">resides in the Los Gatos retirement home for priests in California</a>. If I\'m reading <a href="https://archive.fo/WsB9i">this page from his nephew</a> correctly, he is <a href="https://archive.fo/f2mvZ">the brother of Robert R. Beezer</a>, who was <strong>a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2012/04/05/us/robert-r-beezer-judge-on-ninth-circuit-dies-at-83.html?_r=0">conservative</a> federal judge <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_R._Beezer">appointed by Ronald Reagan to the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals</a>.</strong></p>
<p>I wonder if Judge Beezer ever felt compelled to rule for or against any of the many appeals that came across his bench for fear of his brother\'s hushed up child rape coming out?</p>
<hr />
<p>During the 1970s, Fr. Beezer was stationed at Jesuit High School in Portland, OR. </p>
<p>Portland, of course, is a <a href="https://archive.fo/Qgs1G">major child trafficking hub</a>, as well as the home of coffin builder Scott Cummings (father of Alefantis\' goddaughter &quot;Caris&quot;) and Voodoo Donuts which has almost as much <a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1727863">pedo signaling</a> as Comet Ping Pong and whose owners <a href="http://imgur.com/5v6Acwc">Kenneth &quot;Cat Daddy&quot; Pogson</a> and <a href="http://imgur.com/em3zmBD">Tres Shannon</a> <sup>(research by <a href="https://voat.co/u/SpiritualWar">@SpiritualWar</a>)</sup> were reported to police for having kids at an inappropriate adult party by <a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/2671574">this guy</a>.</p>
<p>Anyone know if any of these guys -- or their parents -- attended Jesuit High School when Fr. Beezer was there?</p>',

            This is the critical part of the Jesuits revelation that shows how evil they are.
           </p>
           <p>
            They basically use this Los Gatos home as a quarantine for all their Pedo Priests. They "removed them from ministry" hiding them from legal repercussions
           </p>
           <p>
            but the Los Gatos Home is in a residential neighborhood full of children
           </p>
           <p>
            Moreover, there are tons of reports of these priests abusing the staff, and other priests who are going senile.
           </p>
           <p>
            Essentially you have a Pedophile Playground full of sexually abusive Priests raping each other and their underpaid hispanic/asian caretakers.

             Well, it makes sense that they would put them somewhere. It's not like civil authorities will deal with them if the statute of limitations expired on their crimes. I would imagine if they don't put them somewhere, they end up homeless or on the street, which is worse because no one is monitoring them.
            </p>
            <p>
             I would imagine this place would need some serious security, though, to prevent vigilantes from torching it.

              They are being moved/relocated BEFORE the STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS is up. In some cases, I suspect it is to avoid prosecution.
             </p>
             <p>
              Example:
             </p>
             <p>
              William J. Wood: Sexual abuse of a minor: 2002
             </p>
             <p>
              Assignments: Verbum Dei High School, Los Angeles, CA 2000-2002 Sacred Heart Jesuit Center, Los Gatos, CA 2002-2004
             </p>
             <p>
              The "quarantine location" only came out recently (people are deducing it from the list -which documents where/when the priests were moved - and when the abuses occurred vs reported. Since around 2000, a priest is credibly accused, then they are immediately relocated to the Los Gatos home.

              Until the Jesuits West revealed this 111 person doc, this was just thought to be a Jesuit home for elderly priests.

             <p>
              Nobody knew it was actually a pedophile priest colony.

             <p>
              (P.S. Additionally, the Jesuits claim that they have no documentation when Priests are assigned to "temporary posts". So this is only a partial list of abusers/assignments.)

               It's worth considering the idea that those higher up the hierarchy are actually hoping that facility will be targeted -- those guys can name names of those who knew what they were up to, they're expensive to house, and they are a constant albatross around the neck of the order. If someone firebombs it, it solves their problems AND gives the order victim status. I expect that, next.

                Considering only 8 of the priests named are living (and likely going senile due to age) while the remaining 103 are dead, I consider this a limited hangout. They are only naming the people who CAN'T name names, while other known pedophiles/protectors likely exist within the order

            An interesting review on Jesuit High School. "The kids here have the personality of a Hollywood cardboard cut out". This was posted on Google maps. 
Jesuit is a private school known for educating snobs. It is a perfect setting for the kind of suspicions pointed out in this post.

             Jesuit Schools have long had a reputation for producing high performing students.
            </p>
            <p>
             Problem is. Even the students who aren't religious, drink the koolaid and think that they are somehow elite.

            You like Jesuits? Look up Jerry Brown's connection to  the Broadcom founders. Brown is a Jesuit priest. Samueli built a Holohoax museum and heavily funded the the Discovery Center built in symbolic form of black cube Satan. Nicholas built an elaborate underground sex dungeon in Laguna Hills, complete with Shiva statue like at CERN. Nicholas used to promote up and coming bands, who's now famous frontmen both hung themselves.
