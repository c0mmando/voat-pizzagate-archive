            Yes. This is exactly what I've been thinking about. How do we interrupt the supply chain? I've started looking at DC craigslist to see what I can find in regards to daycare adds, for sale, etc. I'm not near DC but we need boots on the ground looking at parks, CPP, any suspect place and they should be filming and documenting what they see. Let's shut this shit down until we can expose it. I read on another post that Christmas is their favorite time to abuse children, so we need to be vigilant NOW. RIGHT NOW.

            Unfortunately there is no way we can do surprise raids. Just imagine trying to trespass on property owned by armed criminals of the worst and most depraved sort. Being stopped by a locked door is the best case reasonable scenario here.
           </p>
           <p>
            The point of these investigations is to expose what is going on so that the police is forced to take serious action, hopefully resulting in the entire thing unraveling when culprits rat out each other. That isn't going to happen before the inauguration though.
