            For what it's worth we've contacted the FBI about WorldCorp several times. They know about the videos and to be honest people were calling the FBI so much they started hanging up on people reporting WorldCorp.
           </p>
           <p>
            Hopefully that makes you feel a little better. I totally get how horrific people feel when they first see the ARG footage. I came close to puking my guts out to be honest. It was fucking horrible.
           </p>
           <p>
            You bring up a very good point about not being able to distinguish Real vs Fake. I don't know anything but I strongly suspect that Law Enforcement will be doing something about who ever's running the show over at WorldCorp. Maybe not but even putting a kid through that shit for art's sake is disturbing. Where the fuck are the parents of these kids? What parent would let their kid put an ARG video like that up on youtube.
           </p>
           <p>
            Maybe the FBI didn't want to contact the parents because they don't want to blow the lid on Pizzagate? That seemed like the MO over there when James and Andrew SlowWalker were in charge.
