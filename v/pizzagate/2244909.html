<p>And people in the comments section of a review of that book mention Mr. &quot;Stone&quot; being his pen name. (Mixed opinions btw). One person even observed that he seemed to be British: </p>

<p>A surprisingly enjoyable read. I thought it was going to be another yawn inducing &quot;thriller&quot; with single-page &quot;chapters&quot; but it turned out to be very engaging. The interesting thing is the author is using the name &quot;David Stone&quot; as a cover - he is apparently some kind of enchilada in the intelligence community and doesn\'t want to reveal himself. (No picture of him obviously.) But his writing does ring true, and his language is ... dashing. He could be British or have some British connection - I can\'t imagine an American writer saying things like &quot;deader than di and dodi&quot;. Unputdownable, really.</p>

            Well, You have Outdone yourself again.  I hate to simplify something so complicated a movie, but one thing that I kept seeing in all of this as I read your post and also after seeing the trailer, I felt there was a constant need to point out that the rape was a figment of her imagination.  Although it mentioned that some of it might have come from some horrible happening from paternal abuse, it seemed like he was trying to blame the rape she was "imagining" on her past.  Could Polanski be trying to cover what he and other rapists have done by putting into the mind of viewers that these type of acts are in the mind of the victims?  Idk, but it seemed that, like a ribbon,it  was woven throughout the film.I could never watch this whole movie, for at one point in my life I had a recurring dream (nightmare actually) of being raped by a faceless attacker.  It only happened three times but frightened me to the core.  A friend suggested a therapist that could evaluate the dream but I never went through with it.  This film is horribly frightening for anyone that has rape fears or has been a victim.  I think that any man thought watching this at the time of release, would come away with the idea that the fears this woman had were all due to her past or all in her mind.  The Thinking of the Pedophile  Polanski.

             Thanks for your reply.  Glad you did the wise things 1) lay off the movie, 2) forget about therapists offering 'dream evals'.
            </p>
            <p>
             I think early films/radio/books have a lot of clues regarding clandestine operations (like MK ULTRA) and blatant sexual predators, who show off, so to speak, by some of the work they produce. By incorporating a combination of pathological 'bragging' in plain sight and mockery towards their audience, they enshrine their hidden acts/inclinations for themselves, so that they and their friends (who are aware of the 'story behind the story') can admire it.  Pedophiles and other sexual predators seem to excel at this like few others can.

              Yeah, it's like a message inside the message.  But also like what we have been talking about, where the studios have been sending messages by the movies they make.  They are all playing this game.  The pedos though, are really good at it because they are good at grooming, like they are grooming us, to their way of thinking.  It is really sick when you think about it, just like they are.

            Ok I will play along. The writer/director of Mr. Robot is Sam Esmail who's previous writing includes the movie... Comet.

             Great piece of trivia thanks!  Can't believe how one incidental bit of info that leads to another, can suddenly open up so much info on obscure (to me anyway) history, where banking/wars/art culture/politics intersect.

             observation about Sam Esmail and, following some additional trivia, have fallen down a historical/cultural 'who's who' of banking rabbit holes!  LOL....still finding my way out of it.  ;)
