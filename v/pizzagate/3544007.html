<p>However I never stated why I\'m weary of Q and will in this post. Besides No name (McCain) Q specifically seems to go after the Democrat party much more then the republicans which worries me. What about Republican pedophiles in the past such as Dennis Hastert? Craig Spence? Those were confirmed politicians who were pedophiles.</p>

<p>Second my own distrust of the government. Q has said most of our institutions are corrupt and will need to be arrested. Their first post talked about the National Guard locking down major cities to stop once mass rioting occurs when Hillary is arrested.</p>
<p><a href="https://qmap.pub/read/1">https://qmap.pub/read/1</a></p>
<p>Yes while the National Guard is used for emergencies on U.S. Soil I hope this power is not abused. Jade Helm 15 comes to mind. The U.S. Military practiced invading American soil in 2015 in seven states.</p>

<p>Third what about Deep State Military like Miguel Aquino? The horror stories of child sexual abuse at Military bases like the Presidio Daycare Abuse haunted me when I read it.</p>

<p>Fiona Barnett said she was abused at Military bases as well. In Australia yes but it just shows that even in some of the largest countries in the world their is Deep State in the Military</p>

<p>I spoke in this post what I believed the Deep States original plan was, to start a second civil war or drop a virus then initiate Martial Law which will lead into an NWO. I hope that\'s not what Q is. A pro Martial Law psyop. </p>
