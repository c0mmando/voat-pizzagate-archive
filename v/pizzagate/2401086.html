            Maybe we should use the analysis of the "We Will Win" post as an example in the discussion. Maybe post what I wrote about that post, how it didn't fit the rule or explain the post, but hey, it was a good post anyway. Look in that thread. It was the morale booster of the day. They were breaking out the champagne bottles in that post and having a blast. A post that should have been deleted because the title did not describe the post. They would have missed all that fun and morale boost if that post had been deleted because of the title. Home bro, I think we might have just found something we an do to reduce the chances of misery around here.

            This is exactly why I keep preaching "common sense." A mod with common sense and good intentions might be able to work with this rule, but, why keep a piece of barb wire laying in the trail? I know a mod that would have deleted this post, waited for the bitching to set in, and then moaned about how victimized he was. We can eliminate that possibility real quick. :)

            It wobbled a little in the air on the title seams but it still hit the numbers :) If we nit pick these posts like that we are going to continue to piss people off and there is no need in deleting a good post because of the title. None. We are here to deliver good content not to be rule experts. The only reason people are so freaked out about these damn rules is because one damn mod created an atmosphere of total hell with these rules and it has to stop.

           <hr/>
           <p>
            If our mods are going to delete good posts because of a fucking title then we need to abolish the rule about titles having to be relevant and this post "We Will Win" is a good example of that. Do I want a good post in the trash bin, and a pissed off poster over a nit picking title? Hell no and there is no excuse for it. As a matter of fact, the more I think about this, that damn rule might be a bur under our saddle.

           <hr/>

            The volume in this forum is not high enough to make it absolutely critical that we know about the post before it is allowed to stay. We really need to think about this rule.

            I wouldn't because i'm not expecting posters to build a watch. I just want them to give me some good relevant shit to read. If they don't do it perfectly frankly I could give a shit less. Make it relevant, if you don't build me a watch i'm cool with that too.

            I am glad the following post stayed up, and, by those standards this post would not have stood a chance, none. Win what? Winning is related to child abuse how? Who is "we." blah blah blah blah....I had no idea what this post was about and it didn't burn my mental cash register wondering about it either. I clicked it, I read it, and it was ok in spite of the fact that the title told me exactly jack shit about the post. If I wanted be a nit picking rule freak who just had to have everything perfect I could sit here and dare anybody that wanted to try to "prove me wrong" about the title and before it was over I could be the know it all asshole champion winner of a useless fucking arguement and tell everybody to stop victimizing me.

            But I don't need to be anybodys victim. My daddy was an award winning famous champion football coach. I watched him draw plays at night all night long before a huge game. The next night I got to sit on the sidelines and watch how shit got done. His motto is "make it fukn happen, git it done, and don't be a pussy about it." Sort of the way I feel.

             @Bozito
            </a>
            , thank you very much for this post! The article is a worthwhile read, and important info regarding the unfolding scandal about misbehaviour and child rape by aid workers in Haiti.
           </p>
           <p>
            However, the title is a bit misleading, as the report accuses several organizations of sexually exploiting children, not just one charity (although Oxfam comes to mind).
           </p>
           <p>
            I would therefore ask you to please change the title of your submission.
           </p>
           <p>
            May I suggest to simply copy the Daily Mail headline:
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             'Save the Children warned a DECADE ago that aid workers were coercing children into sex - as Haitian president accuses organisations of cover-up'
            </p>
           </blockquote>
           <p>
            Unfortunately, at present we don't have the possibility to edit a headline, while the post stays up.
           </p>
           <p>
            So I'm very sorry, but I have to delete the post per rule 3 - please fix and
            <strong>
             repost with new title
            </strong>
            .
           </p>
           <p>
            (Should only take a couple of minutes).
           </p>
           <p>
            Thank you!
           </p>

                The title gives the impression that only one charity covered up child sex abuse.
               </p>
               <p>
                The article states that it were several of them. So the title doesn't reflect the content adequately.
               </p>
               <p>
                The
                <em>
                 original headline
                </em>
                of the Daily Mail article reflects the content precisely, so I suggested you might want to use it.
               </p>
               <p>
                In fact, I think you'll get more readers when using DM's original title, since everybody here has already been reading several articles that focused on Oxfam. You'll get certainly more traction when using the original headline, since it presents an interesting new angle.
