It was presidents bloody head in vogue, before The main point though, is that I can see Trumps severed head in this pizza and and so can you if you look and it\'s bloody and scary, but cartoony. It\'s the upper left quarter of the pizza, the upper right is a satanic face, slanted at a right angle as though seated at the table or looking at the severed head laterally, with eye of horus. Actually looks just like the black guy lovequest with one of those black  domino masks something coming out of his mouth. The pizza is made by lovequest and the peice that written is titled A MOVABLE FEAST.

            I speak Italian also and every time I see oto, im hearing otto. Which is 8. So as the one ends another begins theme is also enunciated in the vogue celebration of 1+2+5  (=8) years, with it being broken into halves then there are four special four not special that really starts to look like an 8 pointed star with one big one little one big one little etc around a circular [sun].

            thanks yes I think it is probably about referencing the cult of death, cult of something, very culty. The 125th anniversary of vogue celebrated with 8 roses, 4 are specially dedicated to such and such. 
And about being called RETARDED by two posts. Then called on drugs. I am thinking RETARDED must be CODE for BLACK PERSON.
IT'S in VOGUE, if you can't see a retarded black person with the word BLIND in one shot then BIND in the next, and the last a huge RETARDED grIn dressed as a clown, then you are intellectually bereft and the fact you don't go out there and look at this verify this for yourselves and just call me your programmed words is indicative of the level of mind control THE  sHeeple will have to break thru, to recognize controlled division= controlled decisions. The magazine is full of pizzagate references regardless of whether you are able to view the image of the trump head in the pizza, there is enough in the mag that deservs outrsge, and you give it none. Call me retarded. BREAK YOUR OWN CODE.
