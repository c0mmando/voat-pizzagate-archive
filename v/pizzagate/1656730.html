            It's this case:

            regarding Howard Gutman.  lawyer, actor and former United States Ambassador to Belgium. According to his Wikipedia page
            <a href="http://archive.is/OpPnY">
             http://archive.is/OpPnY
            </a>
            "A State Department whistleblower alleged that an Inspector General's report accused Gutman of soliciting prostitutes and minors for sex while serving as Ambassador, but that Undersecretary of State Patrick F. Kennedy ordered it removed from the report.[22] "  also: " in October 2014, the State Department investigation cleared Ambassador Gutman and the State Department."  Like with a cloth? ;)
There is a lot of ties to names and organizations in the Wiki, and just a survey of it looks like potential rabbit hole warranting a thread of it's own.
Since I'm new to posting (not new to PG Voat), I'll cross link every time I find a related link.  That thread is pretty long so having shorter ones seems okay to me as long as cross links are provided.

             Thanks, I'm sure the MSM was too busy navel gazing or helping Hillary's goal of keeping people uninformed and compliant to give it much coverage.
 I was also perusing some articles regarding Kristie Kenney, the selfie obsessed Ambassador to Thailand (a sex tourism hotspot for pedos), and some other article mentioning sex tourism to the Philippines, (Not accusing Kenney of wrong doing) and I'm wondering just how much our government has done to contribute to the world map of travel destinations designed for pedos. :( 
George Webb's video series describes the business of all encompassing exploitation, take Haiti for example, the Luxury Hotels he references. Once a place is properly exploited, the hotels start being built?  Will full menu room service?
