            "Thanks to our propaganda, to our theories of Liberalism and to our misrepresentations of Freedom, the minds of many among the Gentiles were ready to welcome the Reformation.  They separated from the Church to fall into our snare.  And thus the Catholic Church has been very sensibly weakened, and her authority over the Kings of the Gentiles has been reduced almost to naught..

"We are grateful to Protestants for their loyalty to our wishes - although most of them are, in the sincerity of their faith, unaware of their loyalty to us. We are grateful to them for the wonderful help they are giving us in our fight against the stronghold of Christian Civilization, and in our preparations for the advent of our supremacy over the whole world and over the Kingdoms of the Gentiles.

             That would be quite a stretch.  Most modern criticism of Luther is for his virulent anti-semitic writings condemning particularly the money lenders of their sect.  He railed primarily against the abuses of Papal Rome, and the Jewish money lenders of his day.  And they often went hand in hand.  That is a criticism that holds up well to this day.

              Martin Luther was allegedly a Freemason and a Rosicrucian.
             </p>
             <p>
              There was a great Youtube video that talked about this and the Masonic connections among the Protestant sects in general.  However, the entire channel has been terminated unfortunately.
             </p>
             <p>
              David Icke also talks about this in his book The Biggest Secret.  Even though I believe he is controlled opposition IMHO...

               "Martin Luther was allegedly a Freemason and a Rosicrucian"
              </p>
              <p>
               Freemasonry didn't exist. Rosicrucianism didn't exist.  Most scholars believe that  Johannes Valentinus Andreae (1586-1654) authored the Rosicrucian Manifestos.
              </p>
              <p>
               There is no doubt that modern Protestantism has been thoroughly infested by Freemasonry and the Jesuits.  Latest numbers I've seen is around 30% of Southern Baptist Ministers are practicing Freemasons. And i would in no way seek to defend Lucifer worshiping Protestants or Roman Catholics.  My only interest is in factual information.  Be careful of the "experts" you run into on YouTube videos.  You frequently will get "facts" that are not supported by any information from anywhere. Be especially careful of David Icke because he has a particularly deceptive mix of fact and fiction.  I don't think i buy his lizard men from Mars story, among many other of his "facts." Many things he appears to just make up out of thin air.  At least he offers no supporting evidence.

                 Thanks for the link. I was already aware of most of those things.  If you are now saying that the European Aristocracy was involved in the occult, I could not agree more.  If you are saying that politicians co-opt movements to use to their advantage, I could not agree more.  But if you are saying what your original post says, i.e. that the Protestant Reformation was an occult movement by occultists? Total bunk. Totally without any information to indicate that it even might be so.  How do i know? I have read their writings. I have looked at the writings of people that make that contention, and their arguments always move to the European Aristocracy, not the Reformers.  When you read the writings, it becomes clear that their main objections are to the abuses of Rome, and often of the kabbalists, both Jew and Gentile.  To suggest that they promote the very things that they rail so hard against is absurd.
                </p>
                <p>
                 The very same thing is done in the case of Sir Issac Newton.  I have read many accounts that refer to him as a "dark occultist."  Some of these charges are made by his contemporaries.  The truth?  He condemns the practice of kabbalism clearly and repeatedly.  How do i know?  I have read his writings.  The people who have made those claims either have never read what he says, or they deliberately lie.  Making those claims about Luther or Calvin are equally absurd to anyone who has read their writings.  Unfortunately, most people will rely on a YouTube video "expert" or web page "expert" who has swallowed what amount to childish lies, and false innuendo from people who either have not done real research or have deceitful intentions.

            Unfortunately true.  Practically ALL of the Protestant sects (as well as offshoots Mormonism, Jehovah's Witness, 7th Day Adventist, etc) were started by Satanic 33rd-degree Freemasons:

            There was a great Youtube video in the first article that talked about this in detail; however, it looks the entire channel was shutdown not long after!!!  Probably due to YouTube censorship and crackdown.

            Wow...that is shocking yet unfortunately not. I was born, baptized, raised Catholic. Many generations with VERY strong faith. I stopped claiming to be one years ago and can't even tell my family. My dad would probably disown me. But my eyes opened to it so long ago. Sexual abuse of children and covering it up is disgusting. Popes leaning more an More towards liberal views.  Gold and statues on alters exact OPPOSITE of Gods words.
           </p>
           <p>
            And the money...don't get me started on the money. Catholic religion is not a true Godly religion. And even typing this, the guilt mind trip saying this is strong still bcuz their good at indoctrinating that at a very young age.

             Thank goodness no one is really born catholic, but indoctrinated into it at a very young age (just after birth perhaps).  It would be interesting if you told the truth to your dad.  I understand the catholic upbringing...I got to have one too and I wouldn't wish it on anyone.

             The khazar are the very worst. Except they aren't Jews. That is the lie in history many people are unaware of. The khazar are Ashekenazi. They parcticed Talmudic teachings which were mystics and Satanic then kaballah. As they migrated they became the Jesuits. They are from the khazarian region and became the wealthy bankers that controlled the word. Think Rothschild. They along with Rockefeller &amp; others in the US &amp; the British Royalty funded Hitler and the Nazi's (hence their tribal name AshekrNAZI)
            </p>
            <p>
             They are still in cglharge today and are ruthless Satanists
