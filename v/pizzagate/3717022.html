The band had a major hit with &quot;Cherry Bomb&quot; which was featured in the film &quot;Guardians of the Galaxy&quot; and included rock legend Joan Jett (I love rock and roll). It also takes a look at creepy radio DJ and owner of the English Disco in the 70\'s, Rodney Bingenheimer, dubbed &quot;Mayor of the Sunset Strip&quot;. The club promoted underage drinking and Rodney\'s primary function was to supply rock stars at the time with so called &quot;baby groupies&quot; usually aged 11-14. Stars such as Iggy Pop, David Bowie and Led Zeppelin to name a few frequented this club. </p>
<p>Another interesting connection to Pizzagate is that Rodney started &quot;dating&quot; Kansas Bowling when she was 17 and he was in his seventies. To the best of my knowledge he still is. Here is a picture of the darling couple: <a href="https://media.gettyimages.com/photos/rodney-bingenheimer-and-kansas-bowling-pose-for-a-portrait-at-the-guy-picture-id814874078">https://media.gettyimages.com/photos/rodney-bingenheimer-and-kansas-bowling-pose-for-a-portrait-at-the-guy-picture-id814874078</a></p>
<p>Kansas Bowling directed a video for the song &quot;Disco&quot; (a reference to Rodney\'s club in Hollywood) in which Rodney makes a guest appearance for the band Death Valley Girls: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7V4I0Mg9dVM">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7V4I0Mg9dVM</a></p>
<p>Besides the obvious pentagram on the singers forehead the video is very dark and satanic. The Death Valley Girls played at Comet Ping Pong Pizza: <a href="https://cdn.washingtoncitypaper.com/files/base/scomm/wcp/image/2016/09/640w/artsgrazer_2_40.57ec10a3adc22.jpg">https://cdn.washingtoncitypaper.com/files/base/scomm/wcp/image/2016/09/640w/artsgrazer_2_40.57ec10a3adc22.jpg</a></p>
<p>The band\'s manager Kim Fowley is quite unashamed of his creepy nature and seems to revel in the role, even calling himself &quot;the king of creeps&quot; <a href="https://www.forcedexposure.com/App_Themes/Default/Images/product_images/product_page/C/CED384CD_PROD.jpg">https://www.forcedexposure.com/App_Themes/Default/Images/product_images/product_page/C/CED384CD_PROD.jpg</a></p>
<p>He has been accused of raping a member of the Runaways, Jackie Fuchs (Jackie Fox) when she was 14 years old: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZwEfwXd9lnI">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZwEfwXd9lnI</a></p>

<p>If you remember he was fired after a controversy where deleted tweets showed him &quot;joking&quot; about endorsing pedophilia: <a href="https://www.cernovich.com/james-gunn-endorses-pedophilia-in-10000-deleted-tweets/?fbclid=IwAR0GhrMtFBGQOxVy5sNNSTMeLsp2QrfnDN5MEnayTEXNaFPyrQxx9eK28s8">https://www.cernovich.com/james-gunn-endorses-pedophilia-in-10000-deleted-tweets/?fbclid=IwAR0GhrMtFBGQOxVy5sNNSTMeLsp2QrfnDN5MEnayTEXNaFPyrQxx9eK28s8</a></p>
<p>Lloyd Kaufman peculiarly decided to write Kansas Bowling a check for a 1000 dollars and invited her to come to Hollywood to film a splatter movie called &quot;The BC Butcher&quot; for Troma Entertainment (The Toxic Avenger and other sick movies) in which Rodney also appears.</p>

<p>If you are following the Rachel Chandler\'s friends series you will know that Purple is heavily involved and Rachel Chandler worked for them as a photographer. I am currently working on the segment detailing Purple Magazine.</p>
<p>The documentary looks at these three people in detail. Prepared to get disgusted: </p>

           This documentary details the abuse of all teen punk group the Runaways, mainly committed by megacreep Kim Fowley.

            Rodney B...was a complete pedo. I was a punk rocker in the late 70s early 80s..and Rodney picked up my classmates and took them to parties in LA..he straight up boned my freind who was in 9th grade. I even went with them to a party at Mike Nesmiths of the monkeys house. I spent most of the party in a huge walk in closet,because the shit that was going on was way above my comfort level,I left with Mark Dead of the Hags,and he drove me home.

              You are doing an amazing job, Kofiannan. Just an fyi, if you hit submit and realize afterward you mispelled something, you've got 10 minutes after submitting that you can actually edit the headline. After that it becomes permanent. (I have a submission with a typo too right now that I didn't realize until too late, LOL. It's easy to do).

              It's not
              <em>
               all
              </em>
              I care about.  But your title literally doesn't make sense because that word is wrong.  Your title means the investigation itself was abused.  Not the industry people are committing the abuse.
             </p>
             <p>
              If you are spending so much time doing this investigation, then take 2 more seconds to submit a title that makes sense.  Otherwise you're wasting your time and you look like an idiot.

                 Meowski, please remember too that for some of us, English is often a second language. I also used to be the annoying grammar + spelling Nazi until one day I received a very sweet missive from a young foreign guy (on another website) who explained that he had studied English for a mere three years and felt bad knowing sometimes his incorrect syntax was being judged. He held a PhD.
                </p>
                <p>
                 Also, in one’s haste and excitement to inform fellow friends of new discoveries and updates, it is easy to trip over the letters as you’re furiously typing away - not to mention, these days, autocorrect often wreakes havoc!
                </p>
                <p>
                 Please don’t be too harsh. You’re smarter than that :)

                 Everything is above my pay grade. I am not getting payed a cent for this. You don' think I normally try to read over my post titles before posting? I made a human error and didn't realize until too late and by that point people were already upvoting. You can't edit titles and I don't think it's worth deleting it and posting again. I still don't. Get over it.
