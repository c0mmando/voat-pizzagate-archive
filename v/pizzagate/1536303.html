            Enough with the sensationalistic thread titles.  Every other thread lately is "smoking gun" and overstated claims.

            It is my understanding that the MSM came out and reported that the "corner" who died from arsenic poisoning was actually a "researcher/lab tech" at the fragility, not the actual coroner and that he didn't work directly on the Breitbart death. So.......dunno

            That's a bit of a stretch - not saying Brietbart wasn't killed, but there was no "pizzagate" then, just a tweet.
           </p>
           <p>
            I would suggest that OBummer, $hillary, the Pederastas and others had a lot more to hide than they want people to know, and THAT is what pizzagate is about - it's the key, to opening the door, to all the OTHER SHIT they don't want us knowing about.
           </p>
           <p>
            Raping kids is bad enough,, but what about the Satanic rituals? Murder? Cannibalism? Torture? Those are over the top,k and these people are "in the thick and heavy", if you get what I mean.
           </p>
           <p>
            Time to consider spiritual warfare. Prayer, revelation, orgonite, whatever GOOD spiritual practices you're into, stick to it. These evil phucks have def called upon ("summoned") for help from the dark side, without doubt. They need to go down, and they need to go down HARD, and as best we can we should cease dancing around that issue.
           </p>
           <p>
            I'm pretty certain Brietbart was murdered. I'm pretty certain it was agents in our own government. I'm pretty certain that's why Hillary suggested "droning" Assange at a meeting, in front of staffers. etc, etc.
           </p>
           <p>
            Well then, since they have "wished that" upon another human being, Julian Assange, whom has done nothign but bring the "transparency" they promised (yet never delivered upon), I say we DRONE THEM - with spiritual warfare... orgonite ICBMs right to their "ritual sites". Prayers right to their withered, dark, ruinous hearts. Build a shild around them, locking the demons IN, and keeping others safely away. Let them live out their wildest fantasies, as the blood-lust possessed freaks they have become - and then let them die like the rabid dogs they are, in front of the entire world, so everyone can see.
           </p>
           <p>
            They've turned. They're gone. Blood simple. They're mad. They've asked for it, so let's return the favor. It's the "decent thing to do."

             Breitbarts tweet wasnt in a vacuum. He was specifically investigating how a charity that organised abortions for minors was shielding the girls from enquiry as to how they were getting pregnant in the first place (i.e. being trafficking victims).
No-one to my knowledge knows how Breitbart made a connection to Podesta from that line of enquiry, though

               THANK YOU for that.
I just took another quote from that article and messaged it to David Seaman
"Need we remind Mr. Podesta and Mr. Brock and Mr. Clinton and Mr. Obama of Jon Stewart’s “The Daily Show” rant that should have put an end to the attacks on the messenger: “ACORN appears to be a corrupt organization that aids and abets criminals and gets millions of dollars in taxpayer money.”
