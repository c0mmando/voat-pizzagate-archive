<p><strong>A MUST READ</strong>: <a href="http://archive.is/ZHUlf">In The Wake Of Oxfam, Has ‘Humanitarian Aid’ Become A Euphemism For Oppression?</a> </p>
<blockquote>
<p>This author’s previous report explained that microfinancers and re-insurers involved in Haiti in the wake of the 2010 earthquake and the secondary cholera epidemic included Swiss Re, Fonkoze, and Mercy Corp, all of whom partnered with the Clinton Global Initiative to create the Microinsurance Catastrophe Risk Organization (MiCRO). Mercy Corp is Chaired by Linda A. Mason, who also co-founded Bright Horizons, a large child care organization that has previously operated in Haiti with Mercy Corp.</p>
<p>Despite describing itself as a tax-exempt 501(c) charity, Mercy Corp runs a microfinance portfolio including 1,351,511 disbursed loans worth over $1.40 billion, with total assets worth $435.3 million. It seems remarkable that a tax-exempt charity would also found a number of banks, including Bank Andara, Asian Credit Fund, the Agency for Finance in Kosovo, IMON International, Kompanion Financial Group LLC, Partner Microcredit Organization, XacBank and Mercy Corp Northwest.</p>

<p><strong>BRIGHT HORIZONS</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1518566">Bright Horizons, a large international child care network, is two blocks from Friday\'s Child Adoption Services Inc., which used to share an address with Podesta\'s cousin\'s 8 other businesses.</a> </p>

<p>The December 11, 2013 arrest by U.S. Postal Inspectors of Senator Lamar Alexander’s chief of staff Ryan Loskarn on charges of possession and distribution of child pornography in connection with international law enforcement’s Toronto-based Project SPADE, represents only the tip of an iceberg which connects Alexander to a network of Tennessee politicians and businessmen associated with child sex abuse.</p>
<p>In 1998, Massachusetts-based Bright Horizons, a child welfare service company, merged with Corporate Family Solutions, a firm that provided similar services and which was founded in 1987 by Lamar Alexander and Bob Keeshan, who had been known to millions of American children as television’s “Captain Kangaroo.”  The merged company, Bright Horizons Family Solutions, was acquired by Mitt Romney’s former firm, Bain Capital, in 2008.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Bright Horizons is connected to SC Johnson, and also linked through programs such as Hope and Homes for Children in such places as US, UK, Ireland and Rwanda,  and the USAA Child Development Center in Colorado Springs. </p>
<p>It is specifically referred to as &quot;Bright Horizons (SC Johnson Child Care Learning Center)&quot;. </p>
<ol>
<li>RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS</li>
</ol>
<p>The Company has an agreement with S.C. Johnson &amp; Son, Inc. to operate and manage an early care and education center. S.C. Johnson &amp; Son, Inc. is affiliated through common majority ownership with JohnsonDiversey, Inc., the employer of a member of the Company’s Board of Directors. In return for its services under this agreement, the Company received management fees and operating subsidies of $125,000, $245,000, and $327,000 in the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively.</p>
<p>Bright Horizons serves many leading corporations, including more than 95 Fortune 500 companies and 75 of Working Mother Magazine’s “100 Best Companies for Working Mothers”. Our employer clients include Abbott Laboratories, Alston &amp; Bird, Amgen, Bank of America, Boeing, Bristol Myers Squibb, British Petroleum, Citigroup, Eli Lilly, GlaxoSmithKline PLC, IBM, Johnson &amp; Johnson, JP Morgan Chase, LandRover, Microsoft, Motorola, Pfizer, Royal Bank of Scotland, Starbucks, Target, Timberland, Toyota, Union Pacific, Universal Studios, and Wachovia. We also provide services for well-known institutions such as Cambridge University, Duke University, the European Commission, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), JFK Medical Center, Johns Hopkins University, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and the Professional Golfers Association (PGA) and Ladies Professional Golf Association (LPGA) Tours. Bright Horizons operates multiple early care and education centers for 50 of its employer clients.</p>

<p>Schools, day cares, family programs, sports and rec programs, detention centers, Boy Scouts, camps, clubs, secret societies, and particularly church programs are involved. It is a coalition for control to change the model of education and family to a &quot;community&quot; to end individuality. They want to control everything &quot;from cradle to grave&quot;. Everything is based on public-private partnerships which now include church and state partnerships. These are part of the sustainability and educational reform developments that were created in Racine. Sanctuary cities are one example of how this works. They can abuse and hide anything as long as they are in control. </p>
<p>The real agenda is Global Enslavement with the Mark of the Beast enforced through AI, surveillance, and &quot;Community Policing&quot;.The &quot;Root&quot; and model is in Racine, Wisconsin.</p>

           <p>
            There is a connection to a currently active politician (Lamar Alexander).
           </p>
           <p>
            Linda Mason^^ has hosted Obama and Clinton fundraisers in her home.
           </p>
           <p>
            You need to look deeply into Mason's background, Lamar Alexander, and incredibly closely at Mercy Corp.
