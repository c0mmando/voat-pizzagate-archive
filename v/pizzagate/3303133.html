<p>This permanent A list mostly movie actor who is an Oscar winner/nominee and is known by just about everyone in the world has a secret. He likes dangerous sex games and likes unwilling participants. A benefactor who is richer than rich makes it happen. The two share that same fetish. It doesn\'t matter what sex the unwilling participant is, they just like to watch the unwillingness. The thing is though, our benefactor keeps things as safe for himself as he can by always engaging in these activities in international waters. He also makes sure to record all the other A listers who engage in the behavior in case one of them ever decides to turn on him, or if he needs a favor. For several years, the participants were supplied by a very wealthy foreign businessman who was also in a position to remain unscathed while collecting the participants. When that man was arrested though, the participants dried up. Apparently they have found a new person though who is in the ruling family of a Middle Eastern country. It is the same person who shielded the serial child pornographer/pedophile for so long who has been arrested yet again. </p>

             They dropped the charges against Mathews, the Eden Roc owner. But I'm sure this site will continue to refer to him and his family as a rapists. Because that's all there is in Entyland: Rapists, pedos and yachters.

            Yes, they dropped the charges, shortly after Trump's visit I noticed.  And he seem ed to get along so well with the royal family - in a sharp contrast to his previous visit.  He even had Andrew escort him around on his 3 days
