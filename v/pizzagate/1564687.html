             has
            </em>
            been addressed, but I think it's the kid walking by outside. I don't see the ping pong player look toward comet, as suggested. I see the kid looking back and trying to get someone's attention. I see the "dad" look back when a scream happens, but I also see the kid turn and wave their arm. ...Anyone else?
            <br/>
            The players don't react which means either a) that theory is wrong, b) they're hipster douchebags that like to make a point of ignoring children, or c) they're in on it.

            There is a distinct possibility that something nefarious is happening in that restaurant during that clip when you factor in the other things that we know about Comet and James the chicken lover.

            You should clarify your op. It seems like you are trying to discredit the video. I understand what you are asking tho. Imho, its unlikely that this kid was one of the children on display at comet and was chosen to be purchased.... and I don't hear daddy help me... I hear the name James. .. James help me. I'm in here

             Nah, just trying to account for other possibilities as to where the noise is coming from. I will say, also, notice how after the "calm" couple with the child leave the screen, the sound of the kid gradually fades away.
            </p>
            <p>
             Just my observation, though.
