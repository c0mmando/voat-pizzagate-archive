            Gotta commend you brother for being so tenacious. Saw you on video at the DC rally and you did well and kept your composure. It took much courage for you and everyone at that protest to go there let alone speak on a stage, that should be enough for most people to show them that you are serious. I notice that you are seriously concerned about the amount of friction you get from opponents of mj's guilt. You have to amend this approach, you need to voice these facts like there is no other choice, because, as you and I well  know, Michael Jackson is no saint or savior. He wanted to MARRY both a male AND female CHILD, right up until his death. Both of us know he settled any case that cast him in a negative light.
           </p>

            Mj's monied conditioning of the masses has given him a strong aura of pariah and those that fell into his big money machine will hardly if ever move past the brainwashing the MSM did trying to protect their 'investment'. Its even mainstream news and everyone still ignores it.
           </p>
           <p>
            Don't lose hope bro, you're fighting the good fight, people will all eventually see the truth.

            Michael Jackson dressed as a CLOWN as he romped with strippers and wanted to marry Emma Watson when she was ELEVEN if he was unable to wed his 12-year-old goddaughter says his ex doctor
