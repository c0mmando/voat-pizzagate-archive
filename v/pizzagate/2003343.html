             None of it seems useful at all. Between the two articles we posted I would conclude it's a cluster fuck of a source.

              Seems like there is definitely a concerted effort by the Religious Right posters here to move the conversation from "Zionist" involvement to "Jesuits".  There is a certainly a logical reason behind this.
             </p>
             <p>
              Because if Zionism and Israel's role in Pedogate is exposed, then the Religious Right's involvement would be exposed as well, like I mentioned before in one of my own threads:
             </p>
             <p>
              <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/v/pizzagate/1881556">
               https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1881556
              </a>
             </p>
             <p>
              Which is not to say that "Jesuits" don't have any power.
             </p>
             <p>
              But to ignore Zionist element (both Jews and "Christians") is a complete disservice and ultimately harmful to this investigation/research.

                 So you think Christians would rather blame people who are supposed to be Christians than the Jews? Don't you see how retarded that sounds?

                  What it comes to the Religious Right (or at least many in that movement), that is exactly what I think they would rather do.  You might not, but it is most certainly true of some others.

                 <p>
                  The whole pro-Israel philosophy kinda hinges on it.

             I haven't read this book and I'm not a scholar or historian, but anyone can put anything to print in a book. It doesn't mean it's true. You can color a story in any direction desired to fit your intentions. The biggest problem here is accusation without substantiation. Where is the PROOF that the last 4 or 5 or 6 Popes were Freemasons? A photo of the man to become the current Pope is seen in a bus (or subway train) in Argentina reaching into his jacket when the picture was snapped and THAT proves he's a Freemason? A cropped photo (which excludes the husband standing nearby) of a beach scene showing Bishop Woytyla with a woman and a child being playful and affectionate with Woytyla does not prove, imply, or even HINT of anything illicit. We find out Malachi Martin was a Zionist plant AFTER he dies, not when he was bad mouthing the Vatican and Papacy during his many lurid interviews with Art Bell 10 or 15 years ago. Nowadays, you'll find that in practically every anti-NWO article or Youtube videos (or Youtube comment) the word "Jesuit" is linked to the names of Rothchild, Illuminati, the "Black Pope" etc., and characterized as top architects and planners of the NWO world takeover scheme without even a SMIDGEN of proof of ANY nefarious involvement whatsoever. Are we expected to accept the imaginary fantasies of a Zionist-hired gun like novelist Dan Brown, or that Zionist-hired stonemason-come-"scholar" Eric Jon Phelps as proof of anything?
            </p>
            <p>
             The Catholic church is not the Pope, the Vatican, the College of Cardinals, or even the Bishops or Archbishops. It's the PEOPLE who go to church on Sunday and call themselves Catholics. It's the people who get married by a Catholic priest, have their kids baptized in church, go to confession and take communion on Sunday. Some are still able to send their kids to the rapidly-dwindling-in-number Catholic schools where they will receive an education that is FAR superior to the garbage that kids are fed in public schools. I don't know what is left of Catholic Charities today, but there was a time when the Catholic church aided and rescued millions of poor people in distress in America and around the world without fanfare or acclaim. THIS is the Catholic Church that is the foundation of Catholicism; the people who believe in the moral lessons explained in the catechism of their youth and carry that morality - and charity - forward into adult life.
            </p>
            <p>
             The last time I checked, the Jesuit Order was involved in the profession of TEACHING in high schools and universities in America and abroad. If anyone has substantiated PROOF that they are training assassins, or were responsible for the planning and assassination of JFK, or are killing babies in Satanic rituals, or are raping children under the Vatican, or were behind the Bolshevik Revolution and the planned starvation of Ukrainian peasants in the 1930s, etc., etc., etc., then I'd love to see it and judge for myself of their guilt - according to the merits of their PROVEN transgressions.

              Dear Brethren and Friends,
             </p>
             <p>
              Ken Adachi, the Roman Catholic Jesuit Temporal Coadjutor, attacks both Greg Szymanski and myself as being "anti-Catholic." Adachi rightly attacks Zeitgeist and the denial that Jesus of Nazareth was in fact a bona fide person of history as per the works of Tacitus and Josephus. But he then claims to be a "Christian" which is totally false as no Roman Catholic who believes the Canon Law of the papacy can be considered a Christian in the Biblical Reformation New Testament sense of the word.

               Dear Brother Eric,
              </p>
              <p>
               I don't know what a "Roman Catholic Jesuit Temporal Coadjutor" is , but I do know what a liar is. I also know that people who defame and slander other people in public can get sued for defamation of character.
              </p>
              <p>
               I hope you got your facts straight my friend. We can talk about each other's work without going into overdrive. Perhaps you want to reconsider your choice of words.
              </p>
              <p>
               Sincerely, Ken Adachi

            Jesuits are Jews....crypto Jews....but really they are just Satanist.......like the Pope......https://www.henrymakow.com/marranos_--_the_original_crypt.html by Henry Makow Ph.D.
           </p>
           <p>
            After Christians took back Spain from the Moors in the 14th Century, they wanted "to root out all non-Catholic elements in the country and unite it under Catholic rule." (Prinz, The Secret Jews, p.25)
           </p>
           <p>
            Jews had lived in Spain since the 4th Century BC and had prospered under the Moors. The Church demanded that the more than 400,000 Jews convert or leave. Because thousands had been massacred in anti-Jews riots of 1391, more than 250,000 Jews agreed to convert and became known as "conversos."
           </p>
           <p>
            However, the Church soon realized it had made a fatal blunder. As you would expect, the majority of these converts were not sincere. These were called "Marranos" (pigs.) But now that they could pass as Christians, they were exempt from the taxes and restrictions that governed Jews. They were more influential and powerful than ever.
           </p>
           <p>
            They intermarried with the nobility and rose to the highest ranks in government and the Church. The founder of the Jesuits, Ignatius of Loyola , was a converso, and so was his successor Diego Lainex. Most conversos practiced Judaism in secret and were considered "Judaizers."
           </p>
           <p>
            The "Jews had invaded Spain from within...Judaism was not only incurable; it seemed to be invincible....rather than solving the "Jewish question" the mass conversions had created a new problem: a powerful middle class made up of secret Jews." (42)

            The Marranos are the original model for the Freemasons and Communists. They pretended to belong to the target group. But, like Masons, they had handshakes to recognize each other and they met in secret at night to rehearse their subversive dogmas.

             Benjamin Franklin
            </p>
            <p>
             (This prophecy, by Benjamin Franklin, was made in a "CHIT CHAT AROUND THE TABLE DURING INTERMISSION," at the Philadelphia Constitutional Convention of 1787. This statement was recorded in the dairy of Charles Cotesworth Pinckney, a delegate from South Carolina.)

            <p>
             "I fully agree with General Washington, that we must protect this young nation from an insidious influence and impenetration. The menace, gentlemen, is the Jews.
In whatever country Jews have settled in any great number, they have lowered its moral tone; depreciated its commercial integrity; have segregated themselves and have not been assimilated; have sneered at and tried to undermine the Christian religion upon which that nation is founded, by objecting to its restrictions; have built up a state within the state; and when opposed have tried to strangle that country to death financially, as in the case of Spain and Portugal.
For over 1,700 years, the Jews have been bewailing their sad fate in that they have been exiled from their homeland, as they call Palestine. But gentlemen, did the world give it to them in fee simple, they would at once find some reason for not returning. Why? Because they are vampires, and vampires do not live on vampires. They cannot live only among themselves. They must subsist on Christians and other people not of their race.
If you do not exclude them from these United States, in their Constitution, in less than 200 years they will have swarmed here in such great numbers that they will dominate and devour the land and change our form of government, for which we Americans have shed our blood, given our lives our substance and jeopardized our liberty.
If you do not exclude them, in less than 200 years our descendants will be working in the fields to furnish them substance, while they will be in the counting houses rubbing their hands. I warn you, gentlemen, if you do not exclude Jews for all time, your children will curse you in your graves.
Jews, gentlemen, are Asiatics, let them be born where they will nor how many generations they are away from Asia, they will never be otherwise. Their ideas do not conform to an American's, and will not even thou they live among us ten generations. A leopard cannot change its spots. Jews are Asiatics, are a menace to this country if permitted entrance, and should be excluded by this Constitutional Convention."

            seems odd these jesuits would allow so much coverage of the catholic pedo scandals over the past 15 to 20 years.  also odd that attendance at jesuit universities like georgetown for 4 years would make one a jesuit despite ethnicity and or religion. .  im not trying to be a 'shill', but i think blaming all the media suppression of p/g on jesuits is almost as over simplistic as what you claim the shills are doing

             Claims they changed their name from a Jewish name and attended Georgetown law a Jesuit school.

            <blockquote>
             <p>
              Redstone attended the Boston Latin School, from which he graduated first in his class. In 1944, he graduated from Harvard College,[3] where he completed the studies for his baccalaureate in three years. Later, Redstone served as First Lieutenant in the United States Army during World War II[3] with a team that decoded Japanese messages.[7] After his military service, he worked in Washington, D.C., and attended Georgetown University Law Center. He transferred to Harvard Law School and received his law degree in 1947.

              ? Even wiki says Sumner changed his name.  Sumner owns viacom by the way.  Also the disney you mention died in 09 and only owned 1%.  Theres also several key players in several companies you left out.  But anyway again hard to buy its a all a jesuit conspiracy n they "own" the media from this though some good info is posted for further research

             I'm sorry, Blacksmith, I can't in good conscience give a positive flair to this post at this time; it contains WAY too many factual errors. I will give it an "Accuracy in Question" flair, though, for the time being. Someone can ping me to remove it if the original post is edited.
            </p>
            <p>
             Also, every major claim needs to be linked to supporting source material; saying something was proven in a previous thread is not adequate.
            </p>
            <p>
             Finally, there doesn't seem to be a clear understanding of what the term "Jesuit" actually means. This needs to be clearly defined, with supporting links. It is currently being used in a similar way as "crypto Jews" -- in a loosey goosey shilly willy manner that will just continue to debunk Pizzagate for the

              I took out stanford and linked everything I could, out of characters. Can you remove that BS now? It's all accurate and I didn't make any statements about a Jesuit conspiracy in the OP.

               PuppetShow, your entire post is designed to paint a picture of a Jesuit conspiracy. The vast majority of your claims have NO linked support whatsoever. You still list all of the other non-Jesuit schools as Jesuit that were pointed out to you by

                 I wasn't trying to label you as a shill, not at all. I do think there is super shady business at Georgetown. I have family members and many acquaintances that have attended other jesuit schools so its not a clear connection that Jesuit education automatically equals pedophile, these colleges graduate many thousand students every year, so its unreasonable to assume that all those people are pedophile elite. This doesn't mean that the people running the media are not culpable. I think that the media is cia (opereation mockingbird) , and that's  a connection or corrupt path and that maybe Georgetown is both cia and jesuit, it definitely needs to be looked into further. I was out most of today so I haven't been keeping up on today's issues or here calling you shill, Its a good post, maybe just needs more research to refine the parameters.

                   I've been out and haven't read the other comments yet. but I think you raise interesting points. The jesuit issue may be part of the catholic church pedo business, and the media cabal is cia business and you are highlighting where those paths have crossed.

They were founded in the 11th century as a hospital for pilgrims on the way to see the places where Jesus lived and died and only became a military order when Muslims overran the traditionally Christian Holy Land, to protect religious travelers from being captured and enslaved.

In several countries, including France, Germany and Ireland, local associations of the order are important providers of medical emergency services and training.

              For his past and ongoing intellectual and practical contributions to society, and his lifetime of public service to the United States as both a citizen and a soldier – General Petraeus has received the prestigious Princeton University Madison Medal, the American Enterprise Institute Irving Kristol Award, the National Committee on Foreign Policy George Kennan Award, the Royal United Services Institute Chesney Gold Medal, the OSS Society William Donovan Award, the Hudson Institute James Doolittle Award, and numerous others.

                I stand corrected on that issue.  I generally do not use Wiki as a source.  His bio from Washington Speakers Bureau makes no mention, nor do other primary sources.
               </p>
               <p>
                That being said, keep in mind, these schools DO produce normal people.  Petraeus attended the school well into adulthood and long past any age you would want to indoctrinate someone.  And, if he were "on the inside", he wouldn't have been set up and left in shame.

               yes, I find people who convert religions as adult curious. I mean if your first religion wasn't okay, how do you expect a second one to be better? except buddhism which focuses on behavior over deity, but at that point, why even bother? I think it was weird that Tony Blair converted to Catholic too.

            Between my review of recent D/CIA and now this post on heads of media, it's becoming pretty clear, especially through Occam's Razor, what we are looking at here.

            There seems to be a preponderance of Jesuits everywhere kid touching and bad why goes on. Plus a few useful Jews to boot. And useful Christians, etc.

            Excellent post. It would be interesting to look at Jesuit connections in politics and lower tier journalism also, not just in the US but globally e.g. Macron met his wife (🤢) while attending a Jesuit highschool. Georgetown seems to be a hotbed for some reason.

               You have done no original research.  I have heard the drivel you type for over 15 years.  You are the herpes of this board.  You are the shill of all shills.  You sound like John Podesta and his boyfriend James Alefantis

            In the US, most of the media are owned by corporations and are strictly commercial entities. Is that problematic? Yes but it's not as important as the lack of media regulation. Although the FCC is tasked with the regulation and control of traditional broadcasters, the reality is it has relatively little power to control the media.
           </p>
           <p>
            This is not the case in Britain and Australia where there are more detailed guidelines on public ethos, journalistic guidelines and public oversight.

            Many of the schools you cite are not Jesuit.
           </p>
           <p>
            Here is a list of the 28 Jesuit colleges in the US. I took the list from wikipedia but it is also on their own website. So Stanford, U Penn, Stoneybrook, Stoneyhurst, Rutgers (public NJ college), Yale, Harvard, even St John's is not Jesuit. I think Brigham Young is a mormon school.
           </p>
           <p>
            But Georgetown, there is definitely something going on there with pedos, especially Georgetown Law.

             Because this article is getting much positive feedback, i'd like to put forth the below information for consideration.  I'll say though that there are some descent connections mentioned in the OP that warrants further investigation and which weighs against simply saying that one faction is controlling the media.  I apologize to the post i'm responding to because this isn't really responsive-- i just clicked on it to hopefully be placed up on the list so people can see.
            </p>

             The first link is to a long time and imo very good researcher who died relatively pretty young (and there are some questions about his death) and his podcast on the very question of who owns/controls mass media (mostly in the us) - note it's about 5 years or so old:
             <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O4AQ9wE8bz4&amp;t=3315s">
              https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O4AQ9wE8bz4&amp;t=3315s
             </a>
            </p>
            <p>
             The next link is the following story reported in the mainstream press and to me it raises the questions of a) why would the cnn insider make the joke/implied statement in the first place if there weren't truth to it? and b) why was he immediately fired for the statement?
             <a href="http://www.newsweek.com/cnns-rick-sanchez-fired-after-implying-jews-run-media-calling-jon-stewart-bigot-214528">

             </a>
            </p>
            <p>
             I don't really care if i get downvoated or called out.  I'm also not really looking to debate the topic too much.  I just want to get another perspective since the op is trying to make pretty definitive statements on some 'ok' info (couple probs i can mention off the top of my head:  key players at various co's aren't mentioned maybe cuz they don't fit the narrative and it defies some logic to think that going to a 4 yr college somehow makes even non-catholics part of a jesuit conspiracy to control all us media).   the  truth may be somewhere in the middle or maybe more likely both are just part of a larger 'powres that be' structure.  btw, this info is calling out zionists and those that hide behind Judaism, not Jewish people as a whole

              cool, I was just going by the Jesuit's own website. Obviously there are a lot of other Catholic colleges that aren't Jesuit based.

              The important thing is that the people in power are using ritual sex, pedo and child abuse for blackmail or other bondingprotection/promotion of their own elite class for their own self interests. Not everyone who goes to these schools are pedos and clearly you are going to have pedos from other non-jesuit schools.
