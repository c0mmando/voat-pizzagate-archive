           </p>
           <p>
            Saint Michael the Archangel,
defend us in battle.
Be our protection against the wickedness and snares of the devil.
May God rebuke him, we humbly pray;
and do Thou, O Prince of the Heavenly Host -
by the Divine Power of God -
cast into hell, satan and all the evil spirits,
who roam throughout the world seeking the ruin of souls.
Amen.

            I sometimes feel this way, but a fellow investigator suggested that we follow the money and focus on the white collar corruption of the Clinton Foundation and CGI. This will ultimately get us to human trafficking, but in a way that is pallateable for mainstream- or legacy- thinking. We've all been part of this "dumbing down" of society, but some of us will always be more willing to think outside of "normal"." I do think that we might get more traction focusing on the money trail. What do you all think? Seriously, I would like to get these sick fucks too...even reading or listening to videos by or about victims so that I can both understand the gravity and be even more determined or renewed in fighting the fight. I do think the enemy is overwhelmingly powerful, rich, and his strength in numbers. But I won't stop until I get one of those cards to make at least part of the house fall.

             Yes, I agree.  Keep it dry and unemotional.  The Satanism stuff is harder to sell; it just turns people off.  Better to stick to facts and keep drilling down on the CF connections that lead to human trafficking.

            They will rule until we serfs decide to stand up against them.  I don't mean behind a keyboard either.   All it takes is a few hundred or thousand people to bum-rush a political event.

            Yes it is an epidemic of global proportions, but these crowd-sourced investigations are helping to wake people up. We all know the censorship and the lies are to distract people from how exposed and scared they now are... And I believe that there are battles being fought now on many fronts that people aren't always aware of. There are white hats in every brach of government waiting for their moment. We keep making noise, and that moment gets closer every day... 2017 is going to be an important year in world history.

             Free men can't even have a voice or effect a debate on Voat, how in the fuck do you expect the little people to effect the larger battle, when the enemy controls our voice right here on this fly on shit?
            </p>
            <hr/>
            <p>
             Here's an idea, first we the little people take control of
             <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/v/pizzagate">
              /v/pizzagate
             </a>
             , then we move up and take control of reddit,facebook,&amp;twitter, then when we have free speech the world can identify the enemy and eliminate them, clean slate flush the toilet.
            </p>
            <p>
             But until we can effect the narrative on a tiny turd like
             <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/v/pizzagate">
              /v/pizzagate
             </a>
             , how in the fuck can you even dwell on the larger problem?
            </p>
            <p>
             The problem is the PEDO-GOV Elite have their agents deeply embedded in every aspect of our lives, just look at the CUCK'd MODS &amp; their Shills on this forum, they are the majority.

             <p>
              I know twitter fb and Reddit but not here- at least I haven't noticed

             <p>
              But I see your point that we here are convinced and don't need to convince each other.  We know the truth.  But I think it's important to keep posting our findings so that newcomers that stop by Voat can see how much circumstantial evidence there is.  We have everything but the porn itself.  They also need to see how far and wide and deep this goes.  It's a HUGE spiderweb across the globe.  They need to see that it's not just comet ping pong.
             </p>
             <p>
              But I feel your frustration.  Trust me.  I cry and can't sleep and feel anger then hopelessness then hopeful that trump will do something.  His team is a group of hardsasses.  If any administration is going to deal with this, it's his.  If you pray, pray for their courage, strength, wisdom, and Gods protection over them.

              Yeah the single most important thing is the media/propaganda. People think that the kinds of things going on in and being done by our government couldn't possibly happen - it's like believing in the tooth fairy to them, or they simply make the mistake of assuming the powerful people are just people, like them, who simply got into their position by working hard and being clever and talented - they think 'it couldn't happen here.' The ONLY way of changing that is by getting the message to as far and wide as possible, and making sure it's such a strong, clear unmistakable message that it obliterates the MSM narrative. We need to give the world's citizens their 'aha' moment, that moment when you can't deny that something doesn't add up, where you can't deny you've been lied to.
             </p>
             <p>
              I think there should be a group of people brainstorming on this, thinking of clever ways to create that moment and ensure as many people as possible realise what's actually going on in as short a time frame as possible.

              That's a good definition for the "we" of Pizzagate, but I wanted the OP to define "we" per the OP.

              Really, though, the OP is just a rant and this thread is full of AIDS.  Even I'm getting dumber being in it.  TTFN

               What's wrong with a rant?  This is some REALLY disturbing stuff.  It's not a neighborhood association board upset about a fence.  This is children - a LOT of them -  being raped, tortured, and murdered AND being forced to watch other children being raped, tortured, and murdered.

            Time and time again the FBI and CIA have the information but it is so damning to the elite they hide it and they know it yet we are to believe in fake news how about just giving us the TRUTH and stop the hiding and lying to protect these evil people and start locking these criminals up! How many more dead people is it gonna take before the biggest criminal enterprise is taken down making Aldrich Ames look pale in comparison to what is being researched and uncovered here.

            Maybe we should all run for office on a new PIZZAGATE party platform, with primary goal of routing corruption. I'm too old but some of you could do this, even if you start small in your local towns.

            I agree, but the system did lock people into an economic system that means that even for us to organize appropriately cost money we don't have. The whole point of a debt based economy was to control people, no other reason, it is solely for the purpose and a tool of the Bolshevik agenda to destroy and take over societies.

           <p>
            The only way to beat it is with the REAL economy (LABOR), if every person who worked went full anarchist and quit, team played for resources and revolted, then and only then can this system be defeated. Unless we infiltrate them just as they did us! Several generations worth of infiltration and proliferation of Marxist commie Bolshevik spies withing the system.

            Ya we are doomed and the earth will be destroyed, animals will be beaten and tortured, humans enslaved, the earth raped and ultimate destruction of the planet will be imminent.

             Let's give Trump and his administration a chance.  If he fails the children then we can take drastic measures.

             I think there really are official "insiders" that would lead us to coordinate some sort of huge protest like the one in South Korea.  That was the biggest protest I've ever seen.
            </p>
            <p>
             But I think they are staying quiet right now because they know Trump has a plan.
            </p>
            <p>
             Don't lose hope yet.

              I supported Trump cause there was no other options, he is the only one I believe to some degree. I don't like the idea of him being president but not for the reasons of the liberal moronic fuck heads Bolshevik idiots. I think Trump is a good man and will be a good president, but I am not sure he isn't too liberal.

              I want somebody who is going to unlock the truth that should be common knowledge that we have been lied to for 80 years and to a lesser degree, hundreds of years. I know whats in those highly classified records, I want them made public! But even so, it isn't like truth seekers can't see it, the evidence is out there but its buried by propaganda. The world would be a drastically different place if the truth was known, and if the lies even stopped 100 years ago, we would have known a tremendously peaceful world today.. But idiots keep sucking up the propaganda.
             </p>
             <p>
              And lately, as in the last 50/60 years, it has gotten a whole lot more complicated, I need to see somebody who will address the obvious crimes committed by Obama and Clinton and somebody who will go full tilt on the education system. DUMP ALL Bolshevik brainwashed/brainwashing teachers from all schools both public and private. We need to fix this and we have only this one generation to do it, we also need to get young whites to start breeding again, the idiots have been brainwashed into hating them selves for being white and their ancestors weren't even guilty of what they are being taught in schools.
             </p>

              We wont be able to stop anything if we don't pull the roots out of this weed, it will return as fast as the next election.
             </p>
             <p>
              I'm not even Christian but I am hoping they restore some Christian values and kill this Islamification and Bolshevik style revolution. So how the hell do we start reversing the effects of a "gas lighted" society, brainwashed into submission of two of the worst ideologies ever known to man?... Imagine, Islamic Bolshevism... The world would be annihilated in less than one hundred years.
             </p>
             <p>
              If Trump does take a hard line action to reverse these damages, we will never be able to stop the slave trade and it will rapidly return to full force it was at 150 years ago and it will go full global. If that is allowed to happen, and we were almost there, we were hanging by a thread, there would be no way out.
             </p>
             <p>
              EDIT: And we still have to go through congress on Jan 6th and inauguration day. We made it by the skin of our teeth on the election the demoncrats cheated on, and they tried to sway the electoral college, now it has to be ratified by congress.
