<p>Originally from Washington D.C., Pamela comes from a prominent family of builders who helped develop the nation’s capital. Having graduated from Smith College with a degree in Psychology, with advanced studies in Medical Anthropology and group dynamics, she became keenly interested in human potential, and began a quest to find an outlet to inspire and assist others in reaching their goals. Over a 20-year period, she studied numerous systems of meditation and mind development, which ultimately led her to become a founding member of Executive Success Programs, a cutting-edge human potential model.~</p>

<p>~In 2016, after the death of one of Raniere\'s girlfriends, Pamela Cafritz, Raniere allegedly continued to use her credit card as well as a bank account that held $8 million. Although Raniere had been designated as the administrator of her estate, prosecutors allege he had no right to use her credit card after her death. They said that it may have been done to conceal his access to money, that it is potentially tax evasion, and that Bronfman assisted him.</p>

            Originally from Washington D.C., Pamela comes from a prominent family of builders who helped develop the nation’s capital. Having graduated from Smith College with a degree in Psychology, with advanced studies in Medical Anthropology and group dynamics, she became keenly interested in human potential, and began a quest to find an outlet to inspire and assist others in reaching their goals. Over a 20-year period, she studied numerous systems of meditation and mind development, which ultimately led her to become a founding member of Executive Success Programs, a cutting-edge human potential model.~

            ~In 2016, after the death of one of Raniere's girlfriends, Pamela Cafritz, Raniere allegedly continued to use her credit card as well as a bank account that held $8 million. Although Raniere had been designated as the administrator of her estate, prosecutors allege he had no right to use her credit card after her death. They said that it may have been done to conceal his access to money, that it is potentially tax evasion, and that Bronfman assisted him.

           <blockquote>
            <p>
             Now who were THE players behind the birthing of sustainable development? To my surprise, it was Prince Charles. Not happy with the Christian faith, Charles turned to "para- psychology" which some define as "dabbling in the occult." He was greatly influenced by the South African-born writer, explorer, and mystic Laurens van der Post who was a friend of his grandmother, the Queen Mother. The prince was also influenced by James Lovelock, a British scientist who formulated the "Gaia hypothesis, which today is known as the worship of the earth, a belief based on the Greek goddess Gaia, the Earth Mother. Charles concurs with the perversion of Genesis 1, 2, and 3.
            </p>
            <p>
             ​Most people will not find Prince Charles or his environmental activities in the headlines of major newspapers. Nor do his biographies really explain his involvement, as there is basically a blackout on what he is really doing worldwide. In April 1991, fourteen months before UNCED, the Prince held a private two day international conference aboard the royal yacht Britannia, moored off the coast of Brazil. His goal was to bring together key international figures in an attempt to achieve a degree of harmony between the various countries that would happen at the Rio Earth Summit. Then Senator Al Gore was present, along with senior officials from the World Bank, chief executives from companies such as Shell and British Petroleum, the key NGO's, and other officials.
            </p>
            <p>
             Several years ago, I had the opportunity to interview Maurice Strong and specifically asked him about this meeting. He told me he was in London at a World Wildlife meeting hosted by Prince Philip and was asked by Prince Charles to accompany him to Rio for the April 1991 meeting. Furthermore, in 1990 when sustainable development had just been formulated by the Brundtland Commission, it was the prince who commended them for "bringing the term 'sustainable development' into everyone's vocabulary."
            </p>
            <p>
             ​As sustainable development has evolved to the point where the teaching of Agenda 21 is called "Earth Sciences" in schools, universities, and colleges, our government has instituted Agenda 21 through the Presidents Commission on Sustainable Development. Throughout the U.S., there are cities that have adopted Agenda 21 and there are those that are now sustainable, such as "Sustainable Racine." We must remember Russia did not fall to the communists all at once-it was city by city.
​
​I wrote Prince Charles the Sustainable Prince in 1997 with major updates in 1998 and 2000. It is key and relevant for those who want to understand what is happening today. At every turn the Prince is still involved in the affairs of the United Nations, sustainable development, and public-private partnership. The Prince's representatives are to be found at all the key global meetings, expounding and advancing this life changing philosophy. Perhaps we should wonder why the world still follows him and carries out his dictates.
            </p>
            <p>
             ​For ten years, various activists have been warning and educating about sustainable development. Who do we go to? The church has been silent. Major "conservatives" have been silent. No one has even questioned President Bush about his support for sustainable development. It is not even a key issue in this election.

               That happens sometimes, most often when archiving via google. Something to do with the CSS files not loading/caching properly, I guess.
