            It is good to be discerning but certain factors make me believe this is a genuine story. If this were all fake and a setup of some kind, why would the group constantly implore people to come down to help search and for more groups on the ground? Wouldn't that expose themselves to genuine strangers that are volunteering to help? Scammers wouldn't invite others into their scam. THINK. At least they do live streams and appear to be transparent about their donations.

             They already warned every child trafficker in that part of the desert with all their public announcements. The bad guys have most likely fled and won't operate in that area. The best thing to have done would be to keep their mouth shut, sneak around, and catch child traffickers. Announcing their intentions to the bad guys was a blunder of epic proportions.

             Well said and how I feel!  I have been watching their live feeds myself instead of just listening or reading what others have to say.  I feel if they are a sham (their actions are showing otherwise) then they truth will be revealed because the truth has a way of standing on it's own.  I appreciate them taking Action rather than just sitting and feeling hopeless.  They are trusting the Creator for His help, so this will not go down the way humans expect it to.  I believe they have help from the Highest of Authorities!

            I have been wondering the same thing. So far I have not seen anybody verify it. Nathan and Unirock both briefly mentioned it but didn't run with it because I don't think they could verify it either.

             Some good points-Law Enforcement in AZ is non-existant-ROTHSCHILD owned and run,
so if Sawyer didn't turn it all over to these creeps that part  makes sense, they apparently  refused  to come to the site initially, he did find a skull, forensics are  being  debated; he has refused cash, asking for supplies-definitely a + for character and  honesty. This is CHAOS  but  isn't that what we would expect  if there WAS some real  evidence  here and higher  up are  in  on it, including the  reservations, now that is something worth  doing  some  digging

                 Yes-I think any government related character, esp. someone who has  been  involved  in TOP SECRET information and  takes an  oath to the GOVERNMENT has  to  be vetted  before they can  be trusted-most  humans are susceptible  to GROUPTHINK and we  have  all been taught  all  our  lives that Navy Seals  ( policemen, politicians, Drs, etc) . are the nation's  highest example of patriotism, truth, and the American Way, I'm sure many/most  probably start out that way at 18, sorry but although these guys are truly high end warriors whose courage and professionalism is beyond question- they are also the  MERCENARIES behind American Government (I did not say We the People) intrigue and crimes all  over the  world including  murder, theft, torture, invasion, political meddling etc.  at the behest and FOR International Jewry, Israel, Rothschilds, Corporations; while young men mag go  in  blinded they 'aint blind  very long, so no excuses  for military  vets, professionals who  know  about  all this  but  never  open their yaps-you know what the hell is  going on in Afghanistan, with  US soldiers protecting the Goddamned POPPY FIELDS, for  starters-patriots  my  ass-sometimes  the hardest thing to do for a  patriot  is to speak what crimes  you know, refuse  to serve, and even  go to  jail or worse (btw I'm an ardent supporter of NS and  military  in general, but our military, ethics, direction and Constitutionality are in serious  need of REFORM , this  has  to  be said, and addressed )

             He's forgetting some very important points.  These people helping including Lewis Arthur do not have military nor law enforcement experience (at least not all of them Arthur is not a veteran just helps them).  They live in the area and have eye witness accounts from locals that this has been going on for years.  They tried to get help from proper authorities, but you are dealing with a corrupt mayor, law officers in that department who have allegedly been involved in pedophilia and a corrupt hierarchy of government.  This is no names area and Flakes area.  You secure that scene, no photos would have been taken by authorities that would ever see the light of day because their higher ups would not have let them surface.  In other words you have another case like the Newsham scam.

             What I see is this group attempting transparency, yes, it alerts the cartel, the cartel Already knew they were out there.  This was one of the only ways for the public, those who turn a blind eye or don't want to deal with the fact this horror goes on, to see evidence.  Evidence that has been there possibly for years everyone, including authorities have ignored or attempted to talk the unsuspecting public into believing it's just a dump sight.  It doesn't add up, so at the very least, there should be an investigation.

             Another tell is, they did get a retired officer that has experience in dealing with the border, he spent years working Texas and Tucson to give them procedures for the rest of the searches on how to properly secure the crime scene and preserve evidence.  They have some people at the TPD working with them.  This area for it's industry, magnet schools, the amount of CEMEX location connected to the Clinton Foundation, Epstein, Rothschilds and other nefarious individuals warrants a federal level investigation, but we still haven't seen it.

             Casa de los Ninos, when you poke around has globalist connections and is connected to the high school there which has a clear NWO agenda.  Another "charity" fronting helping children and families.  We know what that leads to.  Already had a verified predator case, but in a city like that, who knows how many perpetrators their have been in these "we're helping your children with behavior modification or mental challenges" . fronts and pedophiles who have taken advantage as it gets swept under the carpet by those who are represented by No Name with a foundation that reads like a mirror of the Clinton foundation.  No name has known mob connections.  It really is Sick how these people have gotten away with this for years while people sit tight, waiting for the "proper authorities" to do something.

             Since Roy Potter has experience, wouldn't it be beneficial for him to go and help properly secure evidence these searches find and see with his own eyes whether there is an "agenda" other than taking action rather than "armchairing?"
            </p>
            <p>
             Finally something is being done and waves are being made.  The enemies time line of being sheltered and hidden so these vile people can keep preying upon these children has been denied!  These guys are not professionals, but they are doing something the professionals haven't gotten done for Years due to Obstruction of Justice because these pedos are in higher places staunching those working at the lower levels who want justice.  Why?  You know why, money train, power and ultimately working for the father of destruction doing his bidding.  Multiple reasons which all add up to sheer evil because satan has dominion here and still thinks he has a shot at usurping the Creator's authority.  He will wreak havoc, destruction and chaos until his end.  That is his MO.
            </p>
            <p>
             I have nothing against Roy Potter.  I never get on other people's videos and argue or point out what I think to be false.  It is their right to put out what they want and to have their opinion.  I support that right.  I also don't call those who disagree with me names, poor taste and seems bent on being a right fighter rather than helping or taking literal action to prove it as a psy-op as he suspects.  Talk is cheap, action, well, it's Doing.  Just curious does he also still denounce Q?  Once again, his right and I don't bad mouth those I feel have blinders.
            </p>
            <p>
             I understand people's concerns. Suspicion is healthy, I feel actions and time will tell if this group is all talk about having faith in the Creator who wants a light shone upon this evil, or if they are just a psyop. Seeing things shook up for once that were left hidden, so right now, I am praying for them. It takes a higher power to work through this tangled and ensnared web of deceit. The . wicked one has a lot of connections and people in high places, but there is one who does Not want these little ones preyed upon. He has been adamant about this evil since ancient times! Light is coming and Darkness Hates Light!
            </p>
            <p>
             Thanks for your comments, I will keep watching them. I don't expect they will do everything perfect as humans are fallible. . .all of them. At the same time, the fact that they took the constructive criticism to heart and made moves to get some proper training while doing searches, speaks volumes to me. They are not ignoring sound advice. I can't criticize people putting boots on the ground. Rough around the edges or not, a hero is a hero in my book!
            </p>
            <p>
             They are working for a higher authority, man's ways are not the Creator's ways so they are going to butt up against constant criticism. To be expected.
            </p>
            <p>
             If they are just saying they are trusting in the Creator and are false or putting on a show. ..they Will be Found out because Truth stands on it's on. Deception is not always obvious right away, but in time it becomes apparent. So far, they appear to be who they say they are, only time will tell. I'm just glad there is a group finally taking action and not just all talk. No one else has taken these steps before.

            I saw that a couple of days ago and have been unable to verify it. I tried to verify that a couple of days ago but for some reason my browser does not like these sites for Kentucky Sex Offender Registries. There appears to be more than one site that has this type of information but I can't get the sites to cooperate. Maybe someone else will have better luck. Have you been able to verify it? If its true he should also be registered in Tuscon as required by law.
