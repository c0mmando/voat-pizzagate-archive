            Thanks! I think because there have been no big arrests, we're denigrating our own efforts. We've been FORMIDABLE! Why else would TPTB have staged a false flag at Comet Pizza? It did two things: (1) Turned JA back into being a victim; and (2) Got rid of whatever evidence was on that hard drive. JA is still wringing the hell out of that sympathetic character role. I loved the statement that the first batch of rude comments was "unprovoked". Unprovoked? When someone has captioned baby pictures with LEWD, OBSCENE, and PEDO-LACED JARGON, people's angry response is not unprovoked!
           </p>
           <p>
            I see a lot more activity centering on JA and Podesta today. Let's keep the focus there. We've only scratched the surface. Look how late into the game we figured out that he owned Pegasus for a lot longer than we thought. We'd been dismissing the graffiti KIDS as not being done by him because of the dates we had, but there were the pics proving he'd occupied the space years before. And then my tripping over the symbolism of the wings and that it meant the option of delivering prostitutes to your door. There have been new leads offered, but we have not gotten everything out of those old ones yet. Things need to be followed up on.

            And, yes, prayers ... always prayers.

             Good post, except for the bit about the hard drive.  A PC hard drive fits easily into a coat pocket (DC is cold in November/December), or a briefcase, or even underneath a pizza in a pizza box JA could take home with him.  It is very easy to remove a hard drive from CPP with nobody noticing.
            </p>

             <strong>
              WHY
             </strong>
             stage a crazy event with multiple people involved, drawing attention to CPP, in order to do something easily done quietly on any average evening?

              It can't be done quietly on the side. When you're involved in this sort of high-stakes game, you can't quietly remove evidence that has been identified as evidence. By that I mean, if I had a handkerchief (with mapping that seemed pizza related), BUT nobody knew I had the handkerchief in, say, my office desk's bottom drawer. No problem! I slip it into my pocket and carry it home or to the river or burn it it at The Burning Man Festival. However, when you have a computer that is known to be on the premises, and is further known to be where you work ... and even further known to have video streaming, expenditures, transactions, maybe encrypted files, it becomes a problem. You can't slip it out because IF the police, or FBI, or whatever law enforcement you want to use as an example, were to get a warrant (and the heat was on), you'd have to explain where the damn hard drive is and that would be a HUGE problem. Now you could try to replicate and swap out a new hard drive, but number one it would be new. That's a problem. Number two, you'd have to copy over files that you wanted the authorities to see, but not copy over others ... yeah, I'm going to mention encrypted files again ... that would leave the problem of where those encrypted files were and if you said you used another computer, then where's that computer? You'd better be able to produce something or you're again in deep doo-doo. So if anyone ever is embroiled in the middle of a investigation gone viral, and you have evidence on a hard drive that you don't want people to see, if you can stage a false flag and have someone destroy it is the way to go. An even better way to go is you shooting a bullet into it, having a yutz come in and fire a shot in the wall, and then claiming he ruined your pretty hard drive. That was the beauty of the whole thing. Alefantis and the elite scum he works for got away with destroying evidence because it isn't evidence because it was never subpoenaed. And if it wasn't, then they got away with destroying future potential evidence. And all this is a theory that is based on alleged happenings that don't exist because JA is a quiet, shy pizza guy.

               Your first point (new hard drive looking suspicious) I hadn't thought about, and I see the logic, but it would have been easy enough to purchase (or obtain from a trusted friend, or maybe even another computer JA already had) a used hard drive older than the PG investigation but new enough to have sufficient capacity to replace the "problematic" one.  This could involve an accomplice, but then, the Welch op involved a lot more than 1, and the entire business we're investigating involves many co-conspirators perpetually.
              </p>
              <p>
               He could also have just shrugged and said the old drive had developed a problem so he replaced it.  Hard drives do that.
              </p>
              <p>
               I'm trying to understand your second point.  I can't follow what you mean in this sentence(?):
              </p>
              <blockquote>
               <p>
                Number two, you'd have to copy over files that you wanted the authorities to see, but not copy over others ... yeah, I'm going to mention encrypted files again ... that would leave the problem of where those encrypted files were and if you said you used another computer, then where's that computer?
               </p>
              </blockquote>
              <p>
               By "copy over" I assume you mean "replicate" rather than "overwrite" (meaning destroy).  I don't understand what you're saying about encrypted files, though.  How do "encrypted files" prevent JA from copying over (replicating) everything except the secret file stash we assume he was trying to get rid of?

                No, the purchasing the old hard drive wouldn't work. You can tell when things were copied over. It's a lot of work. Point two is simple enough. Everyone knows there were encrypted files on the original website. If that computer were used to update the encrypted files for those "privileged customers" with access to Haitian specials, then the files would have to be there, no? If they weren't there, go directly to point one or why you deleted all those files. And deleted files aren't necessarily deleted files. So what JA &amp; Co would have to do is write entirely new files or overwrite the old files. Remember: the allegation/rumor/unsubstantiated theory is that bad things were going on in the encrypted section, so he couldn't leave the original files there IF bad things were going on. And I'm leaving out point 3 which is crucial: JA &amp; Co had no idea the time element involved. By that I mean, the justice department could have been working on something, but, more importantly (because of the control aspect) hackers were trying to get into to the encrypted section. Then there was the possibility of theft. Was Comet Pizza really that secure? You have all that coming together in  perfect storm, and they had to disable/get rid of the ALLEGED incriminating evidence fast. A bullet in the hard drive solved a lot of problems. But again, this is theory, supposition, and conjecture.

            Exactly! Alex Jones' statement that James Alefantis and Comet Ping Pong are "only a diversion", makes no sense at all. Diversion from what? Without Podesta/Alefantis/CPP, there wouldn't even BE a pizzagate: the Alefantis-Podesta-link is what got this whole story started, so with what logic would this be deliberately set up to act as a diversion? To divert from the bigger pedogate, that, before Pizzagate, hardly anyone was aware of? Eh?
           </p>
           <p>
            So, according to Alex Jones, there is the globalist pedo-cabal, that managed to go about their business virtually undetected for centuries (if not eons), but all of a sudden and without any immediate threat, decides to create this elaborate and sensational fake diversion story that awakens droves of people to a truth they've taken tremendous efforts to hide.

             I think Alex's argument was that Pedogate i.e. Epstein, the Clintons, Weiner etc. is something that can be proven.  The only problem with that theory is that it's based purely on secondhand information and we have to rely on the word of Erik Prince, Steve Pieczenik and the NYPD - not exactly people that I would rely on if my life depended upon it.
PizzaGate is the only true glimpse into this world that the general public can look into right now.  Not surprisingly, that's where a lot of people are focusing their attention.  After all, there's not much point in sitting around and wondering if the story about Weiner's laptop is true and then wondering if anyone will do anything about it if it
             <em>
              is
             </em>
             true.

            Interesting thoughts.  Has anyone confirmed that the low-level pedo arrests are even real?  As you suggest, they may just be designed to placate the masses into believing that we live in a society of law and order while the elite continue on their merry way.  I haven't seen any names or faces of any offender other than Sandusky.  How do we know these aren't just some big numbers put out in police reports?  There doesn't appear to be any ripple effect from these arrests.
What is Jeff Sessions doing?  We were told that Loretta Lynch was the cork in the bottle preventing action from being taken.

             Not sure if anyone has tried but I doubt it would even be needed. The government if need be can gather hundreds of names using what it has on the american people and throw 200 closet child rapists into prison on the spot if it so chooses.

            <p>
             And you are correct. Zero ripple effect. But they are blowing it up like it's something major when it is not. The arrests are minor. I'm just waiting for them to throw one big name under the bus for the cause on this. They might have to. And people might buy it..

            Absolutely! #pizzagate began with Andrew Breitbart and focused on John Podesta. Nobody knew WTH he was talking about. Then came the supposed coronation of The Cannibal Queen and Wikileaks. Assange's drop woke us up to what was going on by giving a glimpse into the inner madness of this elite cannibal/pedo world.
           </p>
           <p>
            We had to go through the mirror and learn an entirely new language and symbolism -- lewd, obscene artwork featuring minors, coded jargon, and handkerchiefs with mapping that seem pizza related. The Cannibal Queen, the Podestas and their cousins, Luzzatto and her raw, uncensored granchildren, and Mr. James #killroom Alefantis were the pieces of the chessboard and the core that spread its tentacles all the way to Haiti and beyond.
           </p>
           <p>
            And now, enter shills, disinformationsts, and a Navy seal that nobody ever heard of wanting to take this globally when we have a mess going on in our very nation's capitol. This is happening in Washington, DC, folks! HTH are we taking this globally and following leaders that we know nothing about when the battle to rid the streets and government of pedos is here! Without assuring these people are arrested and in jail, they're in positions to do this again at the next election and their constituent base is only growing.
           </p>
           <p>
            The enemy is here. This Navy seal should be going after MS-13. They're the most dangerous terrorist group in America, matching The Cannibal Queen and her elite in ferocity, perversity, and the ability to dole out a merciless cruelty without batting an eye. We need to clean up Washington. That's where Seth Rich was gunned down in the street. He was a patriot and his death is in vain if we are distracted from the central problem and go rushing onto any bandwagon that makes enough noise. The jumping onboard of the #dc10girls is a perfect example. While we wholeheartedly embraced the issue of underage girls disappearing from their homes, by turning it into a racial issue and not keeping it a pervasive issue, the elite divided and conquered. They issued statements like, "Out of the 10 girls, 6 have already returned home." It seemed reasonable, and no logical mind could stay upset when the authorities seemed on top of things by casting the runaways as "voluntarily" leaving when they appeared to "voluntarily" return home. Officials and the horrendous wife-beating alcoholic friend of Alefantis Newsom never had to deal with the 490 other disappearances because of this segmented methodology of only advancing the issue in a narrow perspective.
           </p>
           <p>
            Let's keep hammering away at Alefantis and the dirty rotten core. If this Navy seal guy is on the level, tell him to go the hell after MS-13 if he's all that brave and bad ass! Tell him to film the Podestas if he really wants to help! John Podesta would have been The Secretary of State! THE SECRETARY OF STATE! Are we understanding the implications? And he's poised to be again since the voters that were behind the globalization of America haven't been dissuaded from their original stance!
           </p>
           <p>
            Let's not defeat our own purpose. Stay true to the cause, and if someone new comes along, WE MAKE THEM GET ONBOARD OUR TRAIN! We're acting so desperate that we're believing shill/liar/disinformationists like Jones and throwing away true fighters like Seaman so let's STOP BEING STUPID. We know what we want, and if someone is NOT going to help us, we don't give them support. That means, no subscribing to channels, no RT'ing messages that don't specifically advance our cause, and no following blindly and making excuses for doing so. Being led down another bunny trail will not help, so let's keep cool. Our strategy was working. By hammering at Skippy, The Cannibal Queen, Alefantis, and Luzzatto, THIS happened! Yes, THIS was designed to get us to stop, and I fear it's working.
           </p>
           <p>
            Don't let them win. Dig, dig, dig. Let's make next week, Natonal Pizzagate Week and have every single goddamn post centering on Alefantis, Skippy, big fat Tony, and the rest of the gang who became famous through those emails. How about make it a month? The strategy was working -- don't you get it? WE were winning. Goddamn 60 Minutes got involved. So let's go back and do what was working and making Skippy and Alefantis crack.

             You are spot on (as always) but what I don't understand is now that Trump is in the WH why don't they go into the tunnels and see for themselves where they lead to? We all know that would prove a lot of what we are saying! We have to keep pushing back we are making an impact!

              Because the tunnels would prove nothing at this point. You'd have to have someone committing the crime in the tunnel. If you don't have that, it's speculation. The sheer complexity of the tunnels is another drawback. Where are they in the tunnels? What do they use them for? At what times? It's easier to dig into the operation ... the operation that was interrupted by the removal of the encryption from the Comet Pizza site. So logically, if they had to change where transactions were conducted, where did the exchange of money go to? That's what we should be thinking. In terms of Trump, they're going by the evidence, and sometimes it's easier to get a RICO charge than anything else. It would put them away for just as long and you're not dealing with speculation. Also, juries are WAY more amenable to convicting people on these types of charges. You would think it would be pedophilia, but that depends. People are very resistant to believing this goes on because it is so repulsive, so the burden of proof is enormous. Then you're dealing with children. Children often times don't tell the truth, or express it in a way that's not as succinct as an adult. And if this group is dealing with infants? It's going to be impossible to prove unless you get members of this cult/society/cabal to turn on each other. That's a death sentence for them to do that, so it has to be a pretty strong motivation for them to engage in betrayal. One of the best ways is to keep arresting people on smaller charges and have the evidence lead you to the bigger fish. That's what I hope is being done here. There might also be ongoing investigations that we don't know about. There is evidence out there, but proving there are tunnels will really come out after charges are leveled. It's like with Savile, the throwing kids over the sides of boats and underground chambers came out after.

              Let's hang in there. We are making an enormous difference. I know it doesn't seem it and I get despondent and dejected, too, but a fresh perspective can turn things around.
