            An informative anon says that Waco is connected with pizzagate.
The narrative is different though.
           </p>
           <p>
            The anon said the davidians were rescuing trafficked children. ( people there were multi ethnic )
           </p>
           <p>
            Hillary got them brutally killed as warning to others going against them and to destroy evidence.
There was actually 80+ body count. most were children.
Thats why they employed industrial grade bleach to clean up the place afterwards.

             I posted this in another thread, but I'll add it here too. I asked Webb if he was referring to Waco and he said yep. So that's definitely the right track.
 I posted this in the other thread too, I also remember running across the same anon narrative as you about Waco on 4chan /po/ and saved it:
Here's the link to the archived page:
             <a href="http://archive.4plebs.org/pol/search/subject/knowledge%20bomb/username/anonymous5/page/1">
              http://archive.4plebs.org/pol/search/subject/knowledge%20bomb/username/anonymous5/page/1
             </a>
            </p>
            <p>
             Copied and pasted:
Waco was a cover up in relation to child trafficking/sex rings, but not in the way you immediately think. The Waco Compound &amp; the "cult" that was in it was part of a "underground railroad" type network that was saving children from Elite child sex rings in the US and getting them to safety. With that being said, that explains the significant response(to the point of sending in tanks &amp; burning the place down &amp; shooting everyone one inside to death) against the "cult"/Compound &amp; the following coverup. Many, many more children died in that compound then what was officially reported.(Shot,burn't,crushed) It was a clean up operation. Waco was televised so much in order to send a message to similar child saving networks.
            </p>
            <p>
             So obviously take everything from anonymous postings on 4chan with a grain salt, it could be way off, but the Waco siege was definitely another Clinton scandal that shook the united states for awhile
            </p>
            <p>
             So it sounds like Webb is saying after the Franklin things was busted, they operation was moved to Waco but some people in Waco weren't cooperating or were ready to spill the beans on the child trafficking thing so they were taken out in the famous Waco Siege, and then from what another person/researcher has found it was all moved to New Mexico and a Ranch owned by Epstein.

            Fairly good evidence that Koresh was running an MK-ULTRA training ctr, that he went off the reservation, which is why everybody had to be killed.
           </p>
           <p>
            I was involved with this OP back, in the day our commanding officer of Delta Force was murdered after he spoke publicly about the operation, when DF was called in the GOV (RENO) said their was a "DRUG NEXUS" at the time that was the only way US-ARMY could be activated, When Charlie Beckwith ( Delta Force Founder ) found out that his boys were used to kill children he went ballistic, shortly thereafter he died of a massive stroke, just days prior he was a fit as hell.
