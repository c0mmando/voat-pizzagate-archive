            An added comment by the originator of the post, PART 1
Hmmmm, "Chris &amp; Chester were in the process of putting together actual evidence (including video) of those who had been abused by David Geffen. Somehow, Geffen found out.
           </p>
           <p>
            (Which is easy when you consider how many tons of people in the entertainment industry would bend over backwards to kiss Geffen's ass because with a phone call he can give you a career or end one not to mention make you rich. And Geffen &amp; Co. represent a LOT of money &amp; power - so even managers, agents, accountants, etc. working for a musician would sell them out. Why? Because an artist or actor is only 1 entity - but Geffen &amp; Co can buy and hire MULTIPLE bands, actors, projects. Just like when an actress is raped by Harvey W. and tells her agent and the agent does nothing? Because Harvey is a BUYER and can hire/buy MULTIPLE actors/projects from the agency, thus meaning far more money than any 1 actress can bring in. Geffen &amp; Co. are the same way - so that's why even those close to Chris &amp; Chester could get sold out to Geffen).
           </p>
           <p>
            Anyway, when Geffen discovers Chris &amp; Chester's work to expose his abuse? Geffen &amp; Co approach Chris' wife Vicky. They make an offer of fame/money if she'll help silence/neutralize him. Or whatever will make it so that his platform to expose abuse is silenced. They tell her he's gonna divorce her &amp; her prenup says she gets zero.
           </p>
           <p>
            She agrees, for her own sake. They give her drugs - like Fentanyl - much stronger than the OxyContin Chris used to be addicted to (or something similar). The money's transferred to Vicky's mom's bank account. Vicky encourages Chris' relapse, and with stronger drugs. This is not an instant process, it takes months.
           </p>
           <p>
            When Chris is touring, fighting the bi-polar fight and going from drugs to withdrawals and back? He takes a bunch of Lorazepam and in the depths of depression/withdrawal/self-loathing, after a conversation where Vicky berates him worse...he hangs himself. Vicky wasn't there, but the person that was? Works for her.
           </p>
           <p>
            She doesn't skip a step. NOW she can be famous, with Geffen &amp; Co. help; her mama's and family's help too. She never stops to wonder WHY Geffen wanted him neutralized. She doesn't care about anything but fame, money, and playing the widow role (all she'd have lost had he divorced her). She's been shopping her reality TV show pitch all over town - which everyone knows.
           </p>
           <p>
            When Chester hears of Chris' demise, he is devastated. Apparently there's more to it than we'll ever know. He feels he can't go on - or possibly is put in a position or receiving threats (maybe to his family) or blackmail, or facing being "set up" by Geffen &amp; Co. Either way he's feeling something to where he is in a situation that he sees no exit for himself or his family. No hope. And he wants to take the easy way. He too kills himself. Thus, he too is neutralized.
           </p>
           <p>
            David Geffen &amp; Co. have won, again. I'm not sure WHAT got cut off the blind Enty was writing. Due to the attacks on the site and traffic.
           </p>
           <p>
            Obviously the video still exists that Chris &amp; Chester were preparing. Maybe they felt invulnerable and showed it to Geffen &amp; Co? Maybe they got the video(s) and destroyed them, or maybe the video(s) still exist in someone else's care?
           </p>

PART 2 (cont'd).
Previous BLIND was about FRAUD of a charity.
           </p>
           <p>
            Let me be perfectly clear: I HAVE NEVER ATTACKED SUSAN SILVER. PERIOD!!
There was a time, many years ago around the time when Chris &amp; Vicky first got together that I met Vicky and got to know her. Very charming, at first, and easily wins people to her side. She's a very convincing Psychopath and con artist. She's done it to A LOT of Chris' friends and associates.
           </p>
           <p>
            I know Susan and have always respected her. When I learned of Vicky's true nature and how evil she is? I went to great lengths to help Susan and try to stop Vicky. I failed.
           </p>
           <p>
            Thanks for thinking enough of me/us to share your opinion. It is as valuable as mine or anyone else's. Except Enty's. His opinion is holy writ, carved in granite, and tattooed on David Geffen's ass cheeks in micro-lettering every morning. But please, let's continue to stay classy. 
(THE END).

            The perm is mete-fore for Permanent A+. This is not an actor. This is a political figure head and is out of the country at the time. Has not spoken to his wife since her book was published. He will go down in History. He makes his issues always permanently go away. Dont cross this one.
           </p>
           <p>
            There's plenty of scum out there like Geffen, Singer.

            Still another comment, showing all loose ends may soon have a conclusion:
"Speaking of suicided singers, I figure I might bring this up. 
Remember that famous album cover for Nirvana's "Nevermind"? David Geffen was not a fan of the naked baby penis and wanted it covered up. Kurt Cobain said they could put a sticker on it that says "If you're offended by this, you must be a closet pedophile."
            <a href="http://archive.is/kkAaE">
             http://archive.is/kkAaE
            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            The articles about this interpreted Cobain's statement as some sort of "fuck you" to the public at large. But does that make sense? Not really. A pedophile wouldn't be offended by the picture - in fact, they'd like it.
           </p>
           <p>
            I always interpreted Cobain's statement differently. The way I read it was saying essentially "No one could be offended by this picture. Except for the one closeted pedophile complaining about it" - referring directly to Geffen himself. Needless to say, Geffen let the album go out as is.
           </p>
           <p>
            When was Kurt Cobain's suicide? During the police investigation into Michael Jackson's pedophilia in 1994. Geffen and Jackson had been friends for a long time until Geffen cut Michael out of Dreamworks - which was formed in 1994.
           </p>
           <p>
            If you watch An Open Secret - the Digital Entertainment Network guys are afraid Geffen will have them killed. In the blind above, Geffen allegedly had those singers killed. If the cops in the MJ investigation started looking to MJ's associates and started to have questions about Geffen - who do you think is the first person they'd ask? Maybe the one who referred to Geffen as a closet pedo.
           </p>
           <p>
            There was another Digital Entertainment Network investor though who was involved in the Cobain saga as well. Cobain's money manager - Dana Giacchetto. Quite something that Geffen and Giacchetto were both involved with Cobain and investors in DEN.
           </p>
           <p>
            And for those that think Geffen did it for the money? Yeah maybe. In fact, Giacchetto supposedly made a lot on Cobain's death. But I also think it could have been a combo of motives, not just a single one."

            Here's another interesting comment from an anonymous poster in the know, at the same link:
Htw, speaking of pizza n pedos, I was reminded of this interesting article. Not so much Michael Jackson himself, but the portion about Darlene Craviotto, who is a writer that was working on the screenplay for “Project M”, the Speilberg/MJ Peter Pan film that eventually turned into Hook (sans MJ). Remember those recent blinds about (Neverland) Ranch visits?
           </p>
           <p>
            Annnnnyway, very interesting read here in particular the portion discussing Darlene and what turned into a book she wrote about the experience, and in particular mention of a Hollywood music company where the long running rumor was that MJ had been molested for a long period of time by an executive there. Note the incident Darlene writes about with pizza and a young boy occurred well before the MJ accusations began. Who was the Hollywood music company exec though? Tommy Mottola? Jose Menendez? Geffen?"

            Make sure you skim the posters' comments as there are some brand new reveals that need your attention. Here's one example:
"From South India, Nikki Minaj, American singer, was in the news a few months ago for having secretly donated to various Indian villages with the collusion of missionaries. Sounds great. But why the secretiveness? The news broke in May 2017. Well, Nikki Minaj's brother was recently arrested for pedophilia and child sexual abuse in the United States. Wonder why she was SECRETLY paying these villages for two years before the story broke? Some of the village kids in TN recently reported sexual abuse to a priest who hid the information until the Protestant priest's wife told people."
