            Have gotten notices in red from this website several times saying "Owners of this website are saving IP addresses." Something just felt different about them to me.......have  been threatened before ........I put up a lot of links to this site and pedophile news on FB. Accepted a new friend request this AM and got a serious threatening hack.......with personal info about where I live. Due to poverty did not have virus protection. Now I do........posted this info re. the hack and wording......."A threat beginning with "I knew you were a govt. agent"...newspaper clipping of some murder and the post stated that I was a part of it, giving details about my life............4 chan went down suddenly......I had gotten several notices on voat pizzagate in red saying ...web owners are saving IP addresses on those who visit this site.......the notices were on posts that showed I was being targeted.........the website has been too. They are very careful now anytime you go to the site....(they look over your info before allowing access) All have one thing in common........Jeffrey Epstein and the international pedophile rings.......my hack came through a fb friend request from this morning as well........which turned out to be a FAKE! So even though I was accused of being a govt agent, could not afford virus protection.........NOW I HAVE IT. So if anyone is afraid of threats, just don't visit my site.........because I will continue posting about the international pedophile rings. Children are dying because of them."

            I am trying to find the big party thrown at Windsor Castle where the queen met Epstein. There has to photos ... it was an official occasion (birthday party) and the press has to all be there. But much of the press didn't appear on the internet until 2012. I think the big party was in 2010.
           </p>
           <p>
            I read it this week in the Daily Mail ... but they had a ton of Epstein coverage and forget which article it was in. This gala was called something like dance of the decade.
           </p>
           <p>
            A photo of Epstein and the Queen would be gold!
           </p>
           <p>
            Everything's been scrubbed from the official Windsor Castle website.

             Prince Andrew's billionaire paedophile friend given permission to land private jet at RAF base for visit Sandringham
            </p>
            <p>
             -
             <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1364742/Jeffrey-Epstein-Prince-Andrews-billionaire-paedophile-friend-visit-Sandringham.html">
              https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1364742/Jeffrey-Epstein-Prince-Andrews-billionaire-paedophile-friend-visit-Sandringham.html
             </a>
            </p>
            <blockquote>
             <p>
              Prince Andrew's convicted paedophile friend Jeffrey Epstein was given permission to land his private jet at an RAF base to visit the Duke at Sandringham.
             </p>
             <p>
              The flight log of Epstein's Gulfstream revealed it touched down at RAF Marham on December 7, 2000, before he was hosted by the Andrew at the Queen's Norfolk residence.
             </p>
             <p>
              Aboard the jet that day were someone with the initials ET - thought to be Miss Maxwell's assistant Emmy Tayler - a woman called Kelly Spam, Epstein's friend Tom Pritzker and an unnamed female.
             </p>
             <p>
              ..It had been alleged that the Duke's friend, Ghislaine Maxwell, was on board Epstein's Gulfstream which flew in to RAF Marham on December 7 2000, but it was later denied. Epstein and Miss Maxwell are reported to have stayed at Sandringham as Andrew's guests, before leaving the country two days later on the same aircraft from Norwich International Airport.
             </p>
             <p>
              ....The flight log for Epstein's Gulfstream also recorded an April 1998 flight to Nassau in the Bahamas where Epstein met Sarah Ferguson and Princesses Beatrice and Eugenie, then aged nine and eight....

             In June 2000, Epstein and Ghislaine attended the Dance of the Decades, a spectacular party at Windsor Castle hosted by the Queen to mark Andrew's 40th, Princess Anne's 50th, Princess Margaret's 70th and Prince William's 18th birthdays.

              THANKS!!  If I were in England I'd do to the newspaper library and physically look up the (pre-internet) papers and scan the photos. The splashy magazines like "Hello" I'm sure had lots of pictures.

              England has strict press censorship laws on how they cover the royals .... so I am sure that stops the press there from re-hashing that party.

             Records detailing flights by Epstein’s private Gulfstream jet, previously seen by the Guardian, reveal that in May 2000 Andrew flew with Epstein and Maxwell to Palm Beach, Florida. The next month, Epstein and Maxwell are believed to have attended a Windsor Castle party for the birthdays of Princess Anne, Prince Andrew and Princess Margaret.

            the prince uses Epstein's plane to go to the Bahamas. I think he is moving money around with that plane.  Or drugs.

                 <p>
                  that can save videos for you, at which point you can post them on bitchute, or wherever else you have accounts.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  It is best to save things locally because video censorship is prevalent.

                  It plays the videos without triggering commercials, i think. Probably wrong.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  Possibly if you had a bitchute acct or something similar, might keep vids even after deletion.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  If you ping one of the mods, I'm sure they will have a definite answer for you.
