<p><a href="https://twitter.com/Q_WWG1WGA/status/1007716368639320065">The date of the alleged photo was a very important one. It was the day of President Trump\'s inauguration or January 20, 2017</a></p>
<p>The photo is implying that while Trump was being sworn in, Obama was dressing up in Moloch costume and performing some Satanic ritual to counter Trump\'s mojo with his favorite evil spirits. This would have been problematic, considering Obama was actually attending the inauguration in Washington DC. Since that theory is now dead, maybe he did it after the inauguration. Where did Obama head after the festivities in the capital?  <a href="https://www.hooktube.com/watch?v=4kbdJLA-Qdg">He went straight to Andrews AFB to give a speech to his loyal lackeys.</a> </p>
<p>Since the Moloch Obama did not perform his ritual during or immediately after the inauguration, it must have been later that night in Chicago, like the proof implies, given the \'Chicago\' jacket being worn by Arthur Davis. But that would have been impossible, because Obama was not in Chicago the night of the inauguration,  he was in PALM SPRINGS.  
</p>
<p><a href="http://www.whitehousedossier.com/2017/01/20/obama-schedule-friday-january-20-2017/">Obama\'s Presidential schedule for 1/20/2017 is right here.</a>  As you can clearly see, he departed for Palm Springs, CA at 1:40 EST.  
</p>
<p><a href="https://www.desertsun.com/story/news/politics/2017/01/20/barack-obama-leaves-dc-way-palm-springs/96839886/">Obama\'s journey to Palm Springs ( Rancho Mirage ) was delayed significantly by heavy rain, and after circling the airport twice for a total of 40 minutes, his flight was diverted to March Reserve Air Force Base in Riverside at 5:45 PST, two hours after scheduled touchdown in Palm Springs</a>.  HOLY CRAP, HE BETTER GET MOVING OR HE IS GOING TO MISS THE MOLOCH CEREMONY !!!!  
</p>
<p>The weather in PS was dreadful that entire day and heavy rain flooded the streets and high winds swept over the area.<a href="https://archive.fo/kIvic"> ( That was the reason for the flight diversion and extended delay, as clearly pointed out in this article. )</a>  <strong>\'On the dreary, windswept afternoon, the Obamas\' plane flew over the airport twice and circled the area for more than forty minutes because of the bad weather, according to air traffic control transmission. By late morning, low clouds covered the valley, high winds rocked the area and rain flooded the streets of Palm Springs.</strong>  Sure didn\'t look like bad weather interrupted the Moloch ceremony, did it?  No umbrellas or rain jackets were seen in the \'PROOFS\' currently shitting up all of Voat, Reddit and Twatter. But there was plenty of open umbrellas, rain jackets and soaked Obama lovers all over the Coachella Valley that evening, as seen in the many IG photos in the article.  lol  ( yes, laughing my ass off that it\'s come to this on Voat ). Obama finally arrived at the exclusive Thunderbird Heights Estates after 8pm PST. </p>
<p>So, if there was an Obama Moloch Ceremony on January 20, 2017 it had to take place sometime after 10pm PST ( need time to get FABULOUS!!! ) in Rancho Mirage, CA in an exclusive gated community that has magic powers where rain does not soak all the loyal Cult followers in attendance.  o_0   
</p>
<p>Just for shits and giggles, where was our now famous Witch who took the historic Obama Moloch photo on the next day, January 21st?Because she says she had to delete the photo because <a href="http://is2.4chan.org/pol/1529139853585.png">\'too much hate and lack of support\'</a> You know, the photo that placed her in the exclusive company of Moloch Obama in California at 10pm local time.

            Seemed bunk to me. Also seems like the picture theyre photoshopping the mask onto to in the infographs to show it's him beneath the mask is what was also used for the original pic pulled off, allegedly, instagram.

            I just went over some of my own photoshopped images, just to see if I could see where they were photoshopped.  Most of these are years old (I've been doing photoshopped images for 15+ years) so I couldn't remember the edit locations for most while taking a fresh look at the graphics..... but I ran it through some basic filters, and yeah, Photoshop says 'this shit was photoshopped'.
           </p>
           <p>
            But Obama as satan did not ping either a fresh look at the image, either from a distance or up close, and the filters didn't show anything obvious - to me - either.
           </p>
           <p>
            So either that is one hell of a good photoshop, or it's real.

            However, THIS ONE is real. It is photoshopped by the White House, which released the photo. What are they trying to tell us?

            FWIW your post is the first time I am hearing it was on Inauguration night. I don't believe either you or the OP who posted that photo. I believe the truth is somewhere in-between. Much respect to you, but I think you made some assumptions here.

              Woah. I tried to be as positive as I could be... and now you're attacking me with ad homimens instead of explaining why you think this photo would of had to be some "counter-inauguration ritual"
             </p>
             <p>
              First of all that is a huge assumption. Second of all it doesn't exactly make sense as far as I understand magic. 12 hours later? 24 hours later? what is the time limit?
             </p>
             <p>
              Present any evidence you have that it has to have been on Jan 20th, please. Also don't attack people who are TRYING to take your side.

                Admit your constant negativity I forgot to say in my reply that after looking at the photo again I believe it is photoshopped but again that is different than deep fakes (calling me worthless, a jackass, a flake, a cunt... wow, you are a class act)

                I'm sure the technology can be used on a still photograph but that doesn't change the fact that it is most well known with video and it is probably not necessary here.

                Stop acting evil and attacking people just for having an opinion different than your own, please. For the love of God, the last thing we need is people constantly attacking others and driving down the traffic. D&amp;C 101

                  No I'm just a mostly normal person who comes here from time to time and rarely posts. I was on 4/pol/ when spirit cooking started and then pizzagate later. You keep calling peoples shills and leeches, I feel like you are projecting.

                  Btw in that photo the character obama may or may not be dressed up as is the wife of saturn,
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  Cybele was Saturn's wife who's devout followers would castrate themselves and would later assume female identities. What group religiously practices male genatile mutilation? What group is responsible for the transgender movement? F-ing juice.

                I look at the photo and I agree that it could be fake but it is not a "deepfake" which is a specific software that uses 3d modeling on video to change someone's face, aka the deep fake porn thing, fake celeb porn.

                1) stop with the verbal attacks
2) realize when people are either on your side (I said the truth is somewhere inbetween, aka you got SOME DETAILS WRONG)
3) realize when people who are not on your side can be easily converted to your side
4) use specifics to win support

            This could be fake but the real problem I think your having is that people are attaching this leak to..
" Q "
            <br/>
            " I strongly suspect Q leaked this photo Obama of 
To prep the population for the exposure for the first time in history the satanic cult that has run the world. "
           </p>
           <p>
            Here all the Q believers are debunking all your debunking , but they are using proper software and not just saying " look at the collar though " ( a costume can't be put on over a jacket ? ) before I completely dismiss this , I will need more evidence.

             You have always been on my radar as a limited hangout account.  And now you're really pinging my radar.

             I really don't care about your opinion, btw.  Because you have never supported anything I have done here.

              Prove to me , that the people saying this is real , are just trying to push disinfo ?! I've never supported anything you've done here ? Accusing me of being a limited hangout and I'm on your radar ? Oh no!! 😲 This is laughable . Is it because I don't put all my eggs in the Q basket ? Like I said , I will need more evidence before I dismiss this and I'm aloud to think critically .

                  Because your the one debunking it !  It could have been anyone and I still would question it . You see these days , I don't believe anything till I have PROOF . I don't just think to myself " gee they say it's debunked so I guess it is "  I have to go through all the necessary channels to prove to myself that it's fake .   I simply said " whoa " at a picture and YOU attacked me first ! Now that the record is clear . I would have probably never said another word about that pic if you hadn't attacked me for saying " WHOA "  Then ..... that made me want to look further into it and see that there are ALOT of people who think it's real . So thanks for pointing that out 😊

                   I actually saw your posts on the original and you were clearly concern trolling skeptics of the pic and I called you out there. You look like you totally believe it's real were throwing shade on those those who were doubting it. You have to be some kind of idiot to even imagine that the proofs in the PG post were legitimate.  I already proved the proofs wrong. I used the proofs in the post against it and it was flaired with a DEBUNK by Vindicator.

                  <p>
                   Your 'WHOA' comment was over the top to me and lacked all context to the digital data 'confirmation'. So I asked you about it. I didn't attack you, you're lying.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   It's DEBUNKED, sister.   You have only obvious shills agreeing with you on that thread, not a single legit PG researcher is in your camp.  Stop pretending.

                    What comments on the original ? My first comment was " whoa " . Seriously though , if it's so obviously fake , and so provable, then why worry ? I think it's possible that a costume can be put on over a jacket . Do I wholeheartedly believe it's real ? NO .  Some people can't understand where your proof is , that's all .

                     I honestly didn’t give a crap about the photo until oh well Ian showed up everywhere complaining about people disagreeing with him. Now anyone with just a modicum of questioning gets labeled a shill by him? Sounds weird. Especially since the first question was totally legit - where is his photo date coming from? His whole theory rests on that date, but it’s just a “posted on” date. Everyone knows that doesn’t mean anything. P.s. he’s starting to sound like MF. Just sayin.

              What's in it for me?  Oh, I like debating.
             </p>
             <p>
              You've supposedly pinned down the date a supposed photo was taken based on spurious evidence and then gone on to show that it couldn't be on that date, therefore the photo must be invalid.  Poor logic.
             </p>
             <p>
              Blase and apathic?  Well, it's basically because this is going to continue as a trend.  With photoshop and deepfake this sort of editing will become ubiquitous, from all directions.  I think eventually this will result in people questioning everything they see, which is a healthy response and may help break bubbles and stop polarization.
             </p>
             <p>
              Either that or people will just refuse to look at what's outside their bubble and accept edits that reinforce their beliefs, which will make things even worse.  That's okay too, I'll just sit here and watch the world burn.  This is fine.

                an archive copy of the original instagram post.  The post itself is dated Jan 20th, which is where the date apparently came from.  I suppose it could've been taken that same day, but there's no indication whether or not it was.

            Honest questions..
1.. how do we know the photo was taken January 20 2017, and not October 29 2016 like indicated by the person asking to have that costume for a wedding they were attending on that date?
2. If someone was a Chicago fan, then dont you think they would wear their jacket everywhere, not just in chicago?
           </p>
           <p>
            Your entire argument is based on a date.. if that date is wrong, your entire argument goes up in flames... but if the date is correct.. then great job debunking!

             funny how you don't bother questioning the original post that is all over Reddit and Twitter right now, that's full of holes. Most of those are just the pic, on it's own. What does that mean? It means it's WORTHLESS. And NO, I'm not just using a date. See the attached initial debunk. Look at the thread in PG and read through the links that claim to prove that was the date.
            </p>
            <p>
             You are applying a glaring and disingenuous double standard, Skippy, and your thinly veiled trolling comment here seals the deal for me. You're not even using common sense.
            </p>
            <p>
             You're a shill.  ( don't use 'WE', skippy, there is no WE )

              I've BEEN looking and I CANNOT find whatever info you are using to come up with that info.. you can call me whatever you want.. I am in search of truth.. if it's so easy to say "heres why I think that's the correct date" then why not do so.. why bite my head off and call me names for asking a simple honest question about how you arrived at your information?

            Hey I pretty much hate the Obamas especially him, but pushing something that just ain't so is really beneath us.  I have too much respect for all the work that all of us do to bring disinfo to our board And  the gloating and berating we will receive from shills for believing this, what I will call a piece of CRAP!!!   What do people not understand about respecting truth?  For me just the picture of the head shot of him with the Black Collar was enough proof, but OH NO!!!  Could you not see that there was a Black Collar also on the picture sticking out?  It is beyond obvious to me.  WAKE UP!!!  Somebody was trying to Embarrass Us and Yes, they could not wait to BLAST it ALL OVER!!!  Thank you

             Look, I want this to be real, I really do. But the main issue I have with this photo is the light source. the light coming at him is from the front left, making the sequins shine. That same light would make the sequins on his mask shine, too, and his skin wouldn’t be so dark. #followthelight

              Solid argument. I am no lighting expert either, so this can go on and on. It's odd. If I was to bet, I would say it is a setup, put out there to debunk and say PG is stupid. I don't think it matters either way. I don't rule it out being him though.
