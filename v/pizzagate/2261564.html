<p>Baptist pastor covering up for policeman (I assume both the Baptists and police have rules that would make child abuse wrong and therefore coverup wrong)

<p>Someone once said &quot;power corrupts and absolute power corrupts absolutely&quot;.

            A lot of Satanist infiltrate Christian churches on purpose.
            <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6d5grTGrlYs">
             Mary Lake
            </a>
            For that matter, Cathy O'Brien also mentions that she was programmed by imposter Christians. Many have admitted as much.
           </p>
           <p>
            In addition, there are those that "call" themselves Christians, and use it like a smokescreen a la George W Bush and Obama; there are true, holy spirit filled Christians that so respect God, that their behavior (fruit) is obviously striving to be Christ-like. "Wherefore by their fruits ye shall know them". Matt 7:20
However...
There is no group of ANYBODY doing they WHOLE thing right. We're people, not robots, not gods. There are pockets of real believers, but they often don't attend the same church, and quite frankly-most that really believe are either leaving the major churches and having services at home, or are part of the PG whistle blower set like the rest of the folks here on voat.

            It isn't about religions it's about "people", you will find pedos who are atheists, Charitable organization members, doctors, plumbers.  The common denominator is "people".  Not every person is a pedo but then not every Muslim or Mormon is a pedo either.  Pedos will prowl in any arena that provides opportunity, in Church's there are children's events, so a pedo might pose as a Christian in order to avail himself of those children.  Many Churches are aware of this and while you can't always tell who is a genuine Christian from who is not, what we do try to do is make sure that there is no opportunity, no child is left alone with any individual, doors are kept open, private meetings are done in public settings.  etc.

            Pedophiles are drawn to positions where they have easy access to kids. In religious organizations, they are often just automatically trusted by the naive parents.

             But perhaps their way of organizing meetings makes this less of a problem than with other more hierarchical religions.  That or they are better at covering up?  I think the former but am perhaps influenced by my personal experience going to Quaker meetings in the past.

              Your mission is to destroy all religions, all of them, because through unity they resist YOUR small secretive group and they can do so effectively because they are unified. They only way you can combat them is to infiltrate them.

              I am on to your game, 9 month old poser with CPP a little over 200 that has been incubating so that people won't scream shill at your username. I see the pattern. You are bait posting. There several usnernames of about the same name age with low CPP points that are also slithering around the sub lately.

             A fundamental principal of pedophilia is that pedophiles will flock to wherever concentrations of children are to be found and try to get jobs there.
            </strong>
           </p>
           <p>
            That's why you find pedophiles trying to worm their way into schools, childrens clubs, after-school programs, etc. etc. . . .
           </p>
           <p>
            And all religions want to indoctrinate children in their religion, so they have Sunday schools, Hebrew schools, childrens choirs, madreasas, Buddhist schools for children to become monks or nuns, and so on . . .
           </p>
           <p>
            . . . and that's why you find so many pedophiles becoming priests, monks, rabbis, and other clergies . . .

            In other times, these things may have been covered up/overlooked/ignored. That needs to stop, obviously. We all want to be proud of our beliefs. I think it is impossible to say unequivocably “it doesn’t happen in my religion”. The question we need to be asking ourselves is “what happens if/when such things are exposed”. Personally, I would hope that, going forward in this time of exposure, the religious leaders would expose offenders and seis the justice. Otherwise, they risk making their faith complicit. In the past, a leader may have been able to cover this up to protect their flock. No more. The weather is changing. Soon, religions that hide pedos will likely be torn down. Anyone with eyes can see that.

            I don't think pedos are trying to discredit religion at all.
They are manipulative, and know they can borrow the credibility of a religious institution in order to get access to children....they take advantage of the trust that church members give each other, normal defenses down, and then use the relationships with adults to abuse the kids.
Why would a single guy be super-interested in being a boy scout leader?  People look hard at someone like that...but a single guy at church, helping out with supervision of the kids?  Not as much scutiny....And pedos know it.

            IMO, believers need to take responsibility within their homes. Avoid those services where someone else watches over your kids. Never let someone else do your thinking/believing/worshipping/parenting for you. I have left the Methodist, Mormon and Catholic faiths for these reasons. The problem is not the right-hearted believers in these faiths (there are many honest and kind ones in each of these, it is the power structure that allows corruption to weasel in.

            I went to an SDA high school with ~15 teachers. Before my first day my mum said to be careful because one of the teachers was a known pedo. He continued to work there after he had been arrested and until a few months before he was convicted and sent to jail. When I made a comment to my mum (referring to her years earlier statement) saying that it’s good I won’t have to worry now about the pedo, she said, “No, that’s not who I was talking about.”

             <p>
              Six men were jailed at Leicester Crown Court last week for offences including facilitating child prostitution. The convictions are being heralded as a legal landmark because it is the first high-profile case involving a Sikh victim of sexual abuse which has led to convictions in the UK.
However, Inside Out London has uncovered evidence that there are potentially dozens of other young Sikh victims of sexual exploitation and few of these cases have come to court.

             National Anthem are you suggesting that priests, monks, rabbis, pastors go to the trouble to become priests, monks and rabbis just so they can discredit the selected religion by abusing children.  It only discredits the religion if it is not covered up, if it is exposed.  If it is exposed you go to jail and in jail you risk being killed by prisoners who hate pedophiles.  My goodness what lengths these people will go to to discredit a religion.  Amazing.

              The Jesuits are told to go out and infiltrate other religions. Their purpose is to gain information and influence but if the ultimate goal is a NWO and to establish a one world religion then destruction of traditional religion needs to happen first.
BTW I am not religious but can still see this is happening. No mental gymnastics here. In fact I made a post about this months ago.

               Exactly right. This absolutely is an important tenet of satanism and the Sabatean/Frankists sect. It is also an important component of higher level masonry. Churches are the most basic power structure that can be easily corrupted. From one point of view, they represent the lowest rungs on a ladder of social power. To most like us, people seeking to serve in these areas should hold and espouse the ideals of those faiths, but power hungry individuals and luciferina cultists, this represents the low hanging fruit in our gullible system. They jus lie with a serious look on their face, and their IN.

               Ah so it is intentional that priests abuse kids to discredit Catholicism and the Bishops then intentionally cover it up to further discredit the religion?
              </p>
              <p>
               Its not the case that a homosexual becomes a priest and discovers that he has ready access to boys and using his power and status he abuses altar and the Bishops cover it up so that the Catholic church won't be discredited.  Gee somehow I think my scenario is more likely.
              </p>
              <p>
               What is amazing me is the verbal and mental gymnastics that folks are going to to defend religions.  That of course is why this is big, especially in the Catholic church.  Moms and Dads protect the church so much that they won't believe their kids.  Happens with Protestant pastors too and no doubt in other religions.  Folks desperate to protect religion facilitate the abuse of kids.

                It is intentional. It is the ilk of the Sabbateans and Jesuits and this plan is hundreds of years in the making. They do it to corrupt and destroy Christianity and the memory of Jesus. Jesus is their enemy number one.

                That happens too but the upper level Bishops gladly and intentionally hire people they think will molest children. It is an intentional plan to destroy Jesus's memory and Christianity forever.

                 I cannot disprove God.  However each religion tries to disprove the god of other religions.   Interesting....
                </p>
                <p>
                 Hierarchies are what create problems.  What I have pointed out about religions has shown to be true in political hierarchies, business hierarchies, police departments, schools, and even movie business hierarchies.  Some are more likely to have specific abuses.  Forcing priests to be celibate seems to increase the risk of abuse.  Schools give access to kids but the movie business gives access to attractive kids whose parents want the money their kids generate.  Etc.
                </p>
                <p>
                 By your logic I could assert that Harvey Weinstein did what he did to discredit the movie industry.
                </p>
                <p>
                 My post might wake some parents up to trusting their kids if they say the beloved pastor, respected teacher, etc abused them.

              Zevi is the devil incarnate. The Frankists and Sabbateans have a long history. The oldest recorded name for them that I know of is the Donme, which interestingly enough is also an anagram of Demon. Here is a Wikeleaks email in which they are discussed.

               Another less well-known offshoot of the Jewish population in Turkey are the Sabbateans, (or "Donme"), the followers of a 17th century Jewish cleric, Sabbatai Sevi, who lived in Izmir (and later Thessaloniki) and claimed to be the messiah. Confronted with the option of converting to Islam or dying, Sevi became a Muslim. Many of his followers did so as well, while secretly maintaining their Jewish observances. No accurate statistics exist regarding the size of the Sabbatean community, or how many of those still adhere to Jewish traditions, though they may number in the thousands.

               I realize Makow is controversial but he understands the Sabbateans. He wrote this, its accurate, and will save me from having to explain it.
