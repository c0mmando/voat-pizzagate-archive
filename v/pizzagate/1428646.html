   Reddit sub gets banned on the same day that WaPo, NYT, etc. release articles on Pizzagate for the first time in weeks. Not strange at all.

            Blueberries are you alright? Your Kline post was deleted and it had your name as deleted too? It won't let me pm yet I have no scores :( I hope you're okay.

            Definitely not a coincidence.  I'd upvote you if I had any left.

            I'm assuming, though, that the fact that Reddit is not only banning pizzagate but all pizzagate spinoffs and related subs, that a lot of users who weren't convinced before will be suspicious now.  It's definitely inconvenient, but I'm really crossing my fingers that enough people see through the censorship and know that there's something real, and something awful happening right under our noses.
