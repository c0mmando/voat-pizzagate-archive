            No one needs to prove jack to anyone, at the very moment. No one owes anyone and their nonpaid citizen tinebif concern and research. Controlling the narrative, does not solve cases. This is not a class assignment. In fact, over anal retentive is a sure symptom of sado maso, narcisstic types.
           </p>
           <p>
            Ones legit concerned of children lives, appreciate any citizen that dedicates time and even outs themselves at risk by getting involved.
           </p>
           <p>
            Noone has a right to dominate and tyrannize anyone. Major creepy control issues, mate.
           </p>
           <p>
            As IF Pizza gate is limited to just the DC area or a restaurant. As IF, human trafficking is not done WW. Ireland case in courts , cleay shows how orphanscwere brought to the USA.
           </p>
           <p>
            Spending sooo much time and effort to control ones, guilt Shane them to do this do that, do it now, control the narrative in such limited teems is fishy as fruck.
           </p>
           <p>
            Brow bearing bones so anal retenrive to pish citizens out of investigating is quite obvious an agenda. Take a chill pill and let ones " pop their corn."
           </p>
           <p>
            You don't own them.or their time, and every post you attack, too.ones much time and effort to do. Perhaps, they need to do their chores, work, take a dump; as you demand answers right away.
           </p>
           <p>
            NO solved investigation EVER was is lved under such controls or demanded source at the moment.    No one owes you time, effort, slave work at the moment. Legit would be, if you find more sources, please post as able or thanks for leads, I'll go look for sources myself.
Control, tyranny, demands, demean are always from narcissistic, control types; and sado maso types.
           </p>
           <p>
            A person could not even clean a home or anything, without anal retentives that judge, judge, berate, over expect and over demand and are selfish about the time, effort, work.of others.
           </p>
           <p>
            You don not like an area, then overlook it and keep it moving vs jump down throats of others.
           </p>
           <p>
            Maybe you need to sit on a vibrator and meditate till you learn, respect, not ordering, and keep it moving if its not up your fancy Nancy, alley, narrative.
           </p>
           <p>
            As IF, crimes get solved by your tyranny, outcaste modes..bahhh hum bug! 
Someone even.paid money to get the Epstein tennis plans and spent hours, and oh, your on tyranny, nonapreciate, got to be perfect control mode, asap.
           </p>
           <p>
            Versus a freaking thankyou. Very rude and disrespectful, control freaking it, darling..get OFF peoples back, no one asked to be RIDDEN and whipped here. Time us money is time is work/labour freaking respect it. ..or you leave.
           </p>
           <p>
            Everyone you rode like a vitch, I'd trust and rather thave here than a tyranicall dominator, clearly trying to control narrative and rides backs. Any that downvoats those peeps, and uovoars yours, its called, THANKS FOR WWEDING OUT THE FAKES!
           </p>
           <p>
            Kids lives at stake and you stall and block, is dang selfish and suspicious. Every life on here matters that involves with what they see, and the risk.
           </p>
           <p>
            You don't fool me, BOY! Clean it up, or you go. You don't own any of us, voat, web, or the world!!
           </p>
           <p>
            Honest with intent appreciates, fraud agendas do not and bitch like spoiled pusdies to contracts l and dominate.
           </p>
           <p>
            Trying to make all who contribute, miserable here...what ever, this won't a cock whip show, this is to save lives...
           </p>
           <p>
            Epstein island sure is a lead, as his fancy attorney his evidence from public and got him.off on house arrest as intimidate the victim. You need proof, do your own work vs being such a negative, Debbie downer to so many.
           </p>
           <p>
            Open, fee flow investigations SOLVE..not control, Missy.
           </p>
           <p>
            Geez,how do ones in your own personal circle get controlled if you are this way to all who contribute time, effort and even money for maps/construction?
           </p>
           <p>
            Tyranny is FRAUD FRAUD FRAUD AGENDA..or at minimum, a serious need to vibrate on a vibrstor and self regulate, meditate.

            This case is related to the Dutroux Case in Belgium. It is exemplaric and of high importance for we can see that child torture and sexual abuse is common in the highest cercles of powerbrokers, managers, newsmakers , politicans, even royality etc on a very regular base.

              This is an extremely low effort post that is barely tangentially related to pizzagate. The dutroux case is super related to it however due to the fact that there was an attempted cover up and the fact that we have a name of a lawyer defending him now. A post on that topic would further the investigation and would actually be relevant. I'm not against op or trying to slide anything. I just want low effort and off topic posts to go away. Furthering this investigation is and should be our prime directive.

            While this is a very sad story and awful to hear that she had to go through that this is not pizzagate related.
This isn't relevant to pizzagate. MOOOOOOODDDDS

EVERY new discussion post needs to cite at least one source and provide an explanation as to why you believe it is relevant or furthers the investigation. 7. Where the title is not sufficient to explain the connections/content of a link, the body must explain the connection.

              That piece of shit is a shill. They try to sound like they are on your side while trying to slide your topic. This is directly related to pizzagate. She is a victim of global elite trafficking which is what pizzagate is all about.

               Yes she is a victim of it. However if you read down the thread I'm trying to get them to tell me why and how. (I already know why) This is an extremely low effort post that is barely tangentially related to pizzagate. The dutroux case is super related to it however due to the fact that there was an attempted cover up and the fact that we have a name of a lawyer defending him now. A post on that topic would further the investigation and would actually be relevant. I'm not against op or trying to slide anything. I just want low effort and off topic posts to go away. Furthering this investigation is and should be our prime directive.

              Show me how this furthers the pizzagate investigation and isn't just a support circle jerk for your friend.
              <br/>
              Edit: Also if your title doesn't tell me what to expect in this. Something along the lines of "Friend who was a victim shares her story. Accounts of elite european involvement." Would have been a better title.

                      Exactly I'm still waiting for you to explain how this relates to it tho. If you can't please remove.
                      <br/>
                      2. Posts not about PIZZAGATE specifically will be removed. 3. EVERY new discussion post needs to cite at least one source and provide an explanation as to why you believe it is relevant or furthers the investigation. 7. Where the title is not sufficient to explain the connections/content of a link, the body must explain the connection.

                        You need to prove everything. Give me names. Which man from the Dutroux case? I already emailed her and messaged everything related to her asking these questions. However I still am in favor of you removing this and reposting it with a more relevant topic. As it stands I had no idea what the hell was going on just by looking at it.
                        <br/>
                        Also congratulations you finally answered my question after I had to ask it 3 times.

                          I refer you back to rules 2, 5, and 7. The dutroux case and its subsequent cover up may be related to this which I thank you for. However this personal account of a victim doesn't further the investigation. I'm now going to put together a post about the dutroux case because of this post. However I'm still standing by my saying that this post is horrendously off topic and is little more than a distraction.
                          <br/>
                          If I was going to be making a low effort post about it it would be something along the lines of "Dutroux case victim personal account. Attempted cover up does anyone know anything else about this?"

                           Cool, I really don't care about what you would or wouldn't do at this point.
