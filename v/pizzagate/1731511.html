            This always  angers me. The more money and power the perpetrator has the more lenient their sentence.
           </p>
           <p>
            I just finished reading  Governor  Ventura's  book, Marijuana Manifesto.  He described the healing properties of  pure cannibidol versus  the poison weed that's on the streets. Hybrid  strains  of cannibidol healing property  versus  t.h.c.  halucinagenic ratio is not natural.  He  explains why  pharma  and government is keeping  the most healing property of cannibidol illegal and away from people. Pharma can't patent herbs and can't make any money from marijuana which would act as competition.
            <br/>
            He explains that jails have weed users to fill the cells with easy to maintain prisoners, rather than difficult behavioral prisoners.
            <br/>
            At this point it doesn't matter if they legalize weed cause the hybrid potency of the   stuff  on the street has ratios that if overused can cause psychosis in people with specific genetic types, wheras purer ratios, or  cannibidol minus the t.h.c.  wouldn't have the same effect.

              Sorry for the delay... busy at work.
Are you referring to his  jail / weed comment? 
 Good point about checking his sources though.   I trust no one.  I'm not at home at the moment to dig in and find how he sourced it but I'll try on Sunday when I have more time.   He claims that he had access to a lot of information that he previously didn't.   If your seriously interested it may be easier for you to  scan through his book because it might take me awhile to collect his sources and get back to you on it.

               You called it poison weed earlier on too. I'm not sure what we mean by this precisely, though you elaborated a little, or how exactly it becomes poisonous and then distributed in some way. I've never encountered poisonous weed, so this is very confusing.

                I think the ratios  aren't the same as they were previous to hybrid strains.  That is what I mean by  poisonous ratios that have been altered for big highs, but in most cases the healing property is tampered with.    The healing property,  I believe it's cannibidol, is what I'm interested in.    Ventura's  book describes it a little better than I can.  A lot better than I can.   At first I thought  there was no way to clean up the ratios and was anti-weed.  After reading his book I'm pro-weed  but only if the ratios are cleaned up.   He somewhat explains why the government  isn't legalizing it and that was mind blowing....  all political money because they can't  scam off herbs.      I'm trying to learn more.  If you have any more info or can correct misinformation from his book  please share that.   thanks.

                 I'm not so sure what exactly "the ratios" is describing.
                </p>
                <p>
                 So, cannibidol is a
                 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cannabinoid">
                  cannabinoid
                 </a>
                 , or a naturally occurring chemical found in marijuana plants (along with THC, as you described it). These cannabinoids act on cannabanoid receptors located throughout the body which makes up the
                 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endocannabinoid_system">
                  endocannabinoid system
                 </a>
                 . When learning about the endocannabinoid system (ECS), you'll find that it deals with things such as your appetite, mood, memory, and sense of pain. The ECS also regulates the psychoactive effect of the drug.
                </p>
                <p>
                 I believe you're describing the ratios of different CBD, THC, and other cannabinoids produced in the different strains grown.
                </p>
                <p>
                 Cheap pot doesn't get you all that high. The

                  really
                 </strong>
                 good stuff is most likely the strains grown in extremely controlled environments and also most likely the strains grown with the most potent levels of these cannabinoids. They're the strains that will have high levels of different cannabinoids present, and they're the ones that will get you more stoned.

                 It seems you're (and he is) making a case for more CBD strains, or at least more pure versions.

                 However, I'm unsure I would refer to THC as poisonous, or any other cannabinoid, really. Our people have been smoking these plants for many years, we've simply refined their investments.

                 I hope this helps.

                  Thanks for that.  I'll have to watch the vid next week when I have time, but I definitely will check that out.
I may not have specified that I think  theTHC impure ratios is what I consider to be more poison, but   Dr. Suzuki and his colleague in Netherlands claims this only affects specific types of people.     Here's  his   documentary  called, The   Down Side of High part 1 and part 2
                  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQyO3YmS4Gk">
                   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQyO3YmS4Gk
                  </a>
                  The docu made me consider harmful potential  after comparing it to a few people I've known who've used  weed for a long time.  But as I said recently after reading  Governor  Ventura's book,  Marijuana Manifesto,   it seems that  there's way more details than what Dr. Suzuki went into.

                  I'm really open to any info on this.  Thanks for sharing.

            A lot of natural health doctors have been suicided or killed these recent years, legit doctors. I checked the sources in their respective locations of death and they are real. This is not a coincidence. I think this is really the last stand for humanity, if we don't shut this down now in 20 years there will be no one who can put a fight. The last 3 strong countries who can really fight the cabal are being incited to go to war with each other.

            I lost my mum in 2013 on 9/11 (can't script that) due to cancer. She was only 67, all my family members were 90+ . She was given these useless chemo tablets with horrific side effects that do nothing. Whole medical industry is criminal funded by the Rockefellers and other psychopaths. I would recommend book by Ty Bollinger, in it he outlines the whole truth about medical industry. A film by Len Richmond, What if Cannabis Cured Cancer is a must. I have come to conclusion that it is futile to expose pedo gate without exposing GLOBAL CONSPIRACY. Same monsters who fund criminal GMOs are the board members of Americm Medical Association. It is all interconnected. It is a global ant human eugenics driven cabal that uses pedophilia as the glue that binds the joints of this global monstrocity that Alex Jones (before he bacame Trump's cheerleader) had been exposing. The idea that a man could go to jail for using a plant to cure people is ghastly! This alone should tell us about who is in charge of the 'government.'
