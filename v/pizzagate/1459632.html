<p>Parallel construction (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parallel_construction">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parallel_construction)</a>) is a law enforcement process of building a parallel—or separate— &quot;evidentiary&quot; basis for a criminal investigation in order to conceal how the investigation actually began.</p>
<p>Two senior DEA officials explained that the reason parallel construction is used is to protect sources (such as undercover agents or informants) or methods in an investigation. One DEA official had told Reuters: &quot;Parallel construction is a law enforcement technique we use every day. It\'s decades old, a bedrock concept.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;On the basis of strong inductive evidence, it is virtually certain that the Podesta brothers are involved in child abduction, and that the eFits are an example of parallel construction.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It is a multi-billion dollar human trafficking red market operated by international regimes and cartels. Pedophilia, organ harvesting, blood storage, forced prostitution, psychiatric and pharmacological experimentation, sextortion blackmail, human donations, and yes sadistic torture for fun -- you name it -- that\'s what these children are put through.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Let us summarize the data.</p>
<p>All conspiracy theories aside, we are now in a position to state the following as factually true:</p>
<p>J and T. Podesta very much match the police descriptions of child abduction suspects.</p>
<p>T. Podesta collects imagery representing child abduction and abuse.</p>
<p>T. Podesta associates with a convicted child molester.</p>
<p>T. Podesta has stuffed animals near his bed despite not having children of his own.</p>
<p>J. Podesta’s emails are missing during the time of the child abduction.</p>
<p>J. Podesta’s assistant was covering his emails on May 4, 2007, the day after the child abduction.</p>
<p>J. and T. Podesta have been unresponsive to widespread allegations that they are involved in child abduction.</p>
<p>Each fact, taken in isolation, is insignificant. Many people delete their emails, for instance, and it doesn’t necessarily mean they’re guilty of anything.</p>
<p>But when these facts are taken cumulatively in context, they do cry out for an explanation.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;The eFits (an electronic picture of the face of a person being sought by the police, created by a computer program from composite photographs of facial features) of the Podesta Brothers Were INTENTIONALLY Made to Rat on Them for Child Abduction&quot;</p>

<p>*<strong>Antinous</strong></p>
<p>James Alefantis\' current Insagram profile picture (<a href="https://www.instagram.com/jimmycomet/?hl=en">https://www.instagram.com/jimmycomet/?hl=en)</a>) is a bust of Antinous (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antinous">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antinous)</a>). &quot;Antinous (also Antinoüs or Antinoös; Ancient Greek: Ἀντίνοος; 27 November, c. 111 – before 30 October 130[1]) was a Bithynian Greek youth and a favourite, or lover, of the Roman emperor Hadrian.&quot;
&quot;[19] (Lambert, Royston (1984). Beloved and God: The Story of Hadrian and Antinous. George Weidenfeld &amp; Nicolson <a href="http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/256582.Beloved_and_God">http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/256582.Beloved_and_God</a> pp. 90–93.) For centuries, pederasty had long been socially acceptable among Greece\'s leisured and citizen classes, with an older erastes (aged between 20 and 40) undertaking a caring sexual relationship with an eromenos (aged between 12 and 18) and taking a key role in their education;[20] and Hadrian took Antinous as a favoured servant when they were aged about 48 and 13.&quot;</p>
<p>If you don\'t know what pederasty (<a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/pederast">https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/pederast)</a>) is: a man who desires or engages in sexual activity with a boy. If you don\'t know what eromenos (<a href="http://www.yourdictionary.com/eromenos">http://www.yourdictionary.com/eromenos)</a>) means: &quot;(historical, Greek history) An adolescent boy who was courted by an older man, or was in an erotic relationship with him.&quot;</p>
<p>Continuing on, AND THIS MAYBE THE MOST IMPORTANT PART I WISH YOU COULD BOLD ON FB: &quot;Lambert believed that the sculptures of Antinous &quot;remain without doubt one of the most elevated and ideal monuments to pederastic love of the whole ancient world&quot;,[93] (Lambert 1984, p. 80) also describing them as &quot;the final great creation of classical art&quot;.[94] (Lambert 1984, p. 209.)</p>
<p>&quot;This is another one of those pieces of evidence when, taken by itself, isn\'t that big of a deal. But when taken into a grander context it becomes rather meaningful. It\'s like a sentence in a growing essay that has as it\'s position that James Alefantis may be a pedophile. Any single piece of evidence can be explained away, but when those more and more pieces keep being added to the pile, all that confirm the position, it becomes harder and harder to explain away.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It becomes statistically less and less likely that the common theme across all these connections (paedophilia) is completely coincidental.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;He\'s (Alefantis) saying &quot;Look at me, giving ALL this circumstantial evidence! It must suck that anyone investigating me is being labeled as fake news&quot;</p>

            How about a rhetorical question for you?

           <p>
            What is  fake news?

            Pizzagate is a Cass Sunstein plan since 2006 to silence conspiracy theory's on the internet. Sunstein is internent czar for Obama, and bathhouse owner in Chicago, where they used to fuck Obama back in the day.

             Exactly if it were low 'little people' the GOV would be all over this, SOP is cover.
            </p>
            <p>
             It's opposite to what they say. Andrew Kline DOJ is in charge of human-trafficking, owns Besta Pizza with logo "I fuck little boys",
 J Edgar Hoover spent his entire life building dossiers on Gay Men, ... Hoover spent his entire life fucking little boys in the ass.
            </p>
            <p>
             Important People are the Sodomist's running the GOV, the only reason they even arrest little people is to have a pretext to steal their children, or enslave young men/women for the Prison Industrial Complex, e.g. Slavery.
            </p>
            <p>
             It's good that this thing pizzagate got out of control, we just have to wait and see how long its allowed to be kept alive.
            </p>
            <p>
             This is why GOV is working overtime to shutdown the topic, closure of twitter, reddit, voat likely soon.

               The orginal DBA says "ANDREW KLINE", no public record's mention J., so I don't even know why the witch-hunt mentions AJK,
              </p>
              <p>
               Go back to original source doc's and PROVE that "Andrew Kline" who owns Besta-Pizza is not the same ASSHOLE that Owns the DOJ Human-Trafficking Agency for Clinton.

                 The DBA for besta-pizza say's "ANDREW KLINE", why do you keep saying Andrew J. Kline, why would YOUR BOY not use his real name on a public document?
                </p>
                <p>
                 ...
                </p>
                <p>
                 A nick name for james alefantis is Andrew, and James is the middle name of your lawyer, ergo james alefantis works at your law firm. Right?
                </p>
                <p>
                 It doesn't mean shit that you found a lawfirm that has a similar name, have you proven that this lawfirm works for besta-pizza?
                </p>
                <p>
                 Why is it that a place that has a logo 'we fuck boys' is NOT investigated by pizza-gate, why does ALL only focus on comet-pizza?
                </p>
                <p>
                 Here's the problem, you can't prove that your boy Andy J. Kline is the registrar, because his NAME is not on the public document, the name on the document is "Andrew Kline"
                </p>
