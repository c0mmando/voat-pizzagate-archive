            'Shocking and indefensible': 1 in 14 priests in Australia accused of child abuse The St John of God Brothers had 40% of its members accused of abuse. Feb 6th 2017, 7:30 AM 13,107 Views 163 Comments Share596 Tweet Email1 Image: Shutterstock/Creativa Images

            JUST OVER 7% of Catholic priests were accused of abusing children in Australia between 1950 and 2010 but the allegations were never investigated, according to “shocking and indefensible” data shown today during an inquiry into paedophilia in the church.

             Does not surprise me.  Many have had those problems.  Don't know what we can do about it, except complain. This has come up before. It sure looks PG related, since we have had articles about Pell being in Australia to defend his charges.  Sigh.

              pell is probably just a catholic child sex cover-upper not a rapist. The first person to say he was a pedophile priest on the internet was

              when he was allowed to use a fake name in court. He lost his old twitter password because he was sending death threats on the associated gmail account

              - deleted it in a panic when I exposed him and locked himself out of the old twitter account he had with a fake name.
             </p>
             <p>
              And we all know how garry burns is connected to corrupt gay pedophile police - so I think it's a political action to make people support gay marriage and not give the christians what they want - the protection of the sanctity of marriage. That's why I think pell is a psyop.
             </p>
             <p>
              Another example is Bert Newton and Rolf Harris fucking little boys. I've got documents on my scribd.com/luke_mckee about that leaked from the royal commission transcription agency and it's also int he legg / devine dossier people got jailed over.
             </p>
             <p>
              Rolf Harris likes little boys not little girls, and the prosecution him in the UK was a farce, so he could get of after a few years and it seems like justice is done.

              They are prosecuting people for reviving bart simpson joke email porn via email whilst the real pedophiles get off. It that case the NSW court ruled Bart Simpson is legally a "person" - the case that made me believe admiralty law is real.
             </p>
             <p>
              Not enough of the real peds are getting arrested, and when they do it's a flimsy prosecution that will never stick not using real victims. Not all the time but enough to make me very uncomfortable with the whole system.

              Then there is the DA who worked with the gay child fucking pedo cop Christopher Kent Bowersox who attempted to murder me in America. Ed Jagles. See the witchhunt documentary on him by seann penn or my old comments on here about the saga i'm sure you can google.

               I remember your attempted murder story.  These people are out to win, but we can't let them.  I am thinking we don't even know if the vatican can make up their own sex case against someone they want thrown out, in order to put in a real pedo.  They are able to do this if they surely want to.  it also occurred to me about Pell, maybe they want someone else in his seat.  Aye, these are wicked times.

                christopher kent bowersox that faggot was on documenting reality dot com looking at russian soldiers having their heads cut off by chetchan rebels before he tried to kill me the first time. That's what I found investigating his social media.
               </p>
               <p>
                If it wasn't for my security training on arrest procedures, I would have complied with his request to put my hands below the dash out of the line of sight, and he would have got his daily dose of blood and gore, with my face being deformed to satisfy a gay kiddy fucker pedo cop.
               </p>
               <p>
                I've come face to face with this cunt, and in hold up he was telling me if I know what I what's good for myself I should leave my wife and America and not fight the charges of delay or resist murder and no other changes (what the locals call contempt of cop).
               </p>
               <p>
                After I went to IA on him I was nextdoor when he entered my house in O Street Bakersfield through the window with a non-police issued pistol, looked like a sig or something smaller than the usual colt they carry. Twice that faggot pedo cop tried to kill me.
               </p>
               <p>
                If you actually knew what I was getting close to in Bakersfield you'd be shocked. I'm glad I was pulled out of there in hindsight by the Australian consulate. I would have been a dead man if I stayed with Ed Jagles and Bowersox after me.

                 I am glad you are away from there and safer.  What a horrible situation.  I can only imagine what you know about that is going on there, there are things going on in other places as well.  They think people don't know, but there are people that are still some honest people in LE that know the score.  When people wake up I hope there will be payment.

            This is it! The source of all the demons. They aren't real Christians. They are demon possssed people who think they are Christians. It is called the Laodicean church and we are warned about it in Revelation 3. If you can comprehend it-the Laodicean churches are totally possessed like the Catholic Church, Baptist, Methodist, Mennonite and on and on. The Bible tells us the Laodicean churches are bad. They are really demon possessed churches. The Bible doesn't tell us that. God only showed a few people this information about the demon possesed state of the Laodicean churches. The Laodicean churches are all our modern day denominations and the Catholic Church. They are all possessed and have church leaders that molest children!!! Think about it a real church would not have a leader that molests kids. In the early church the apostles did not molest children. Our churches are in a state of depravity that most people are blind to. It is the strong endtime delusion!!!! Quite frankly I'm shocked I can even say this on the Internet and let this long time secret finally out! ----our churches are demon possessed!!!!

              notice after my comment the pedo trolls (mods) gave this post two downvotes. funny eh? seeing a pattern yet... sorry ... i can't take this anymore.. there are good people here but not the mods... from what i heard this is a y-combi reddit ran operation and most of the real old mods /researchers from reddit /pizzagate/ went into deep cover in their own secretive club on tor etc.

              will see what I can come up with, but the fact ......We started in ‘89 as a group foster home, providing enhanced medical care for HIV infected children, we started out as a group foster home under Catholic Home Bureau, which is a foster care agency under the Catholic Charities arm of the Archdiocese of NY.

              In 2000, in July of 2000, we were re-licensed, um, under the Department of Health, so now out of the social services arm of the state, but as a article 28 skilled nursing facility or S.N.F.

               You are a Saint.  Thank you for what you are doing.  I have been on here since 7 am this morning.  If we all were on here 24 hrs. a day it still would not be enough to unearth all of their Rat Line Ops they have cooked up.
