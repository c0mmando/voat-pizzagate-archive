<ol>
<li>
<p>We have exposed a network of evil people, parasites raping and murdering and abusing there power over the masses; numbering perhaps as high as a million people. The masses, though mostly unwitting, share values with us: they have families. They strive for good. When these masses awaken, the guns, power, soapboxes and servants of the elite will disappear. Their bank accounts and talking heads will have no effect. Who wants to conduct commerce with a baby eater? This is why we should laugh at those afraid of a witch hunt. When it is common knowledge that the elite will not bring justice to this evil, a new regime will likely emerge to serve the popular need of the masses for righteousness. When someone appears that is willing to enforce justice for pedos, the current power structure will have no audience or authority. This exposure is a new call to power for those ambitious who ARE NOT satanic pedophiles. It is inevitable because the masses are almost 8 billion in number. The elite will be outnumbered 800 to one at best. That only leaves with the talks of awakening the masses, which is almost finished, IMO. THe sparks is lit, see below...</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>They cannot prevent this awakening. If they shut of the internet, the massive beast will be uncontrollably angry and the elite will be eaten by the masses. If they kill or silence everyone that speaks about pizzagate (and at this point, they would need to get everyone) the masses will get suspicious and 10 will appear for every one silenced. If they just try to censor things or shame pizzagaters with star power... well that’s all they have going right now and it’s obviously not working.
 So that’s my point. I perceive God’s hand in this, though some may dismiss that, rather citing a perfect storm of technology, social consciousness and fortunate events. Whatever it may be. It’s happening.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Let me quote Orwell:</p>
<p>“But the proles, if only they could somehow become conscious of their own strength, would have no need to conspire. They needed only to rise up and shake themselves like a horse shaking off flies. If they chose they could blow the Party to pieces tomorrow morning. Surely sooner or later it must occur to them to do it?”</p>

<p>Follow up:
How do I estimate a million elites? I over shot, IMO. I base my assumption on the number of officials and corporate scumbags worldwide that must be using their influence to hide these crimes contrasted with reports of big pedo rings, like this one:</p>

<p>As to the other stuff; look at the way the elites and media squirm, and virtue signal and shame us. Look at the tweet storms and comments for things that touch on this subject. Sparks are flying. The opposition is losing their shrinking audience, soon to be powerless and alone in their echo chamber. </p>

<p>This is related to pizzagate, because we need to stay awake and not give up. This is the calm before the storm. I’m not saying “relax” though. There’s plenty we can do, here or in our lives. The Big Boss upstairs is the one really making this happen, IMO. He deserves all the credit and I don’t think He’s gonna give up.. I believe He has been patiently waiting the longest and that He is the only one that can heal all the damage done. Please share with the discouraged.</p>

            This is what everyone needs to see.  I wish more people could calm down though and be more realistic about why things will take more time than they want.  Me being slightly younger at age 30.  I could see how people who have been awake for 30 or more years have not much faith left about anything ever changing.
           </p>
           <p>
            But we NEED to keep reminding ourselves.  The INTERNET is still very very new.  The internet has the power to change peoples beliefs like we have never seen before.  Even though these sick satanic globalists are doing everything they can to stop people.  The internet is something they have never had to deal with.  Its literally only a matter of time at this point.
           </p>
           <p>
            Its my personal belief that Trump and the whitehats have all the evidence they need to make arrests and end things for good.  What they need is enough public support and outrage before they make the serious moves.
           </p>
           <p>
            Please everyone keep fighting,  take care of yourselves and be healthy.  Be PATIENT.  And pray to god that Love will win and the people of this plant will come together and help each other.

             Also, let’s watch out for each other. This isn’t like other chat forums. We’re not here for jokes or arguing. It’s obvious that we are all reasonably like-minded. We have different beliefs and ideologies, sure, but we know something important and we care and we are on the same team. Let’s keep a look out for each other. Shills and trolls stick out like a sore thumb here... but we are dealing with the most powerful people on the planet and the biggest mess in history. Be cautious.

            I wonder if "they" ever thought about never being caught. Thanks to the internet, "they" can't keep up with those who will never give up.  More and more people getting the message everyday, even though it seems so sloooow and takes many a long time for the horror to sink in.

            Well said.  I think my only disagreement would be the choice of background music.  I'm hearing a robust version of Tom Petty's "I Won't Back Down" playing along with the progression i'm watching.  I sometimes take a rest and reflect on how things are moving, but i'm never discouraged because the tipping point has passed.  It is far into the rear view mirror of this process.  Too many know too much about a cabal that is far too sickening and evil to share a planet with.  They overplayed their hand.  As Admiral Yamamoto said after the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor: "I fear that the only thing we have accomplished is to wake a sleeping giant and fill him with a terrible resolve."  The giant is only now slowly starting to awaken.  But everyone with eyes open to this is definitely filled with a terrible resolve.  And that can only spread further as more come into the light.

I like that Petty song a lot. Robert Plant put out some new stuff a couple of years ago. One song in particular is quite apt: “Satan, your kingdom must come down”. It’s kinda nice if you ever liked zeppelin.

            I'd say 1 million (based on global numbers) is relatively accurate. Given that our enemy is the .1%, a reasonable number.

           <p>
            "Don't forget. Always, somewhere, someone is fighting for you. As long as you remember that, you are not alone." Yeah, I know, tottaly cheesy to reference an anime quote, but its context of hope vs overwhelming odds and soul crushing despair is VERY relevant to us.

             <p>
              Really dark magical girl series by Gen Urobuchi (the author of stuff like Fate Zero).
             </p>
             <p>
              I'd say TV-14 namely for violence. Has an excellent dub (the movie version rather than the TV version since its the same cast but vastly improved).
             </p>
             <p>
              The series that helped red pill me and refine how I think in terms of this investigation is "When They Cry" (both Higurashi and Umineko). Half psychological horror half fair play mystery. NOT for kids for it is TV-A due to intense violence.

            I wish I could say the same thing for the UK. If you watch any of the television over here, most of it is marketed at pedos, or is pushing a pedo agenda to the weak minded.
           </p>
           <p>
            I think the police and intel agencies involvement in child trafficking, prostitution and brownstoning has given them data on how many paedophiles there are in the UK and what social strata they belong to. This data has made its way to banks, corporations and government and now they are going for the children to abuse them and ruin their futures.

             Hang in there. This thing is gonna have different effect in different places. Even tho you are most oppressed, u r also most awakened, am I right? Prolly limited access to free speech and other distractions is keeping u divided/isolated. When your government starts to lose international alliances, you will likely see more progress, IMO

            Great post bru, but at the end the storms are going to come from heaven..If not we're all screwed.! Pizzagate had no official victims, Dutroux had victims...what HAPPENED? NOTHING. The system is just too corrupted to make a U turn.

             Yeah. The Dutroux case is foreboding. Perhaps the nations where that occurred are too deep in the global elite power nexus. Maybe those people are just too polite. I dunno. It’s an anomaly that has a lesson for us. It would behoove us to look closely at 5hat event and ask why they failed. Also, what worked for them? My guess is that it is directly connected to the tyrannical power of the government in general, for that region, and free speech issues.

            This is a great post. I also agree that God is behind this. I'm not religious but I give full gratitude for everything to God. Any great person has been inspired by God, by the source, by whatever you want to call it.

            I gave into arguing with people of a low nature, that just emboldens them. I know there are good people here that want to make a difference and I need to remember them. Thanks for the message.
