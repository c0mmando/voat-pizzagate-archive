            I just love all these Sharia Blue OPs....they all start with something like:  "Pizzagate is real, but it doesn't involve (put any of the primary suspects here)"  or "Has anyone noticed how the (put weakest online source, alien, Illuminati wild shit here) may be connected?"  or "I hate (put Soros, Hillary, Podesta, here), but maybe we should re-think (any item related to Podestas or main suspects).  These are all basic "anticipation of objection" argumentation 101 strategies.  Don't get sucked into these fake "reasoned" posts.  Brock thinks the Pizzagate community is made up of tin foil hat, cheeto-eating, in the parent's basement type of people.  He still thinks the MSM and Sharia Blue can stamp out this effort by belittling the opposition force of independent citizen journos.

            So how do they find you people? Discretely worded Craigslist ads? While they're waiting for their Big Mac order to come up do they ask you if you want to do some easy work on the side for a few bucks? Or do they just ask their fellow Satanist friends to help the cause by being shills and disrupt the people who are trying to save children and other good souls and make this world a better place?

            Whether or not she is related to pedophile rings, she definitely is an occultist and not someone you want hanging around with or influencing world leaders in a world I or many people want to live in.

            Sort of agree since spirit cooking has to do with the metaphysical which is hard to prove. But the McCann pictures are still very, very strange. How do two people allegedly see the "same" person yet one sees a skinny guy and the other sees a fatter guy and somehow the two sketches of the "same" guy end up looking exactly like the Podestas. When the official story doesn't make any sense and coincidences like this start piling up, something's usually up.

            Marina Abramovic is part of the hierarchy of evil, she is the female equivalent of Aleister Crowley, which is why she's an elite among the elite.  This woman hides her evil  by trying to disguise it as art.

            Sir, this Kickstarter page, and the event discussed, was set up LONG before PizzaGate became a thing. Did you look at the date? It's from 2014. If it was such a secret, occultish and nefarious event as people are suggesting, then why would she include it in a list of Kickstarter rewards? Come on, be logical! She explained what Spirit Cooking was over TWO YEARS before anybody even suggested it involved semen or urine. And where are they getting their evidence from, Googs? ONE VIDEO on YouTube? Lol. Show me any other corroborating evidence besides that stupid video of her painting words on walls and maybe you'll start convincing me.

            The SAME MAN thing.  They thought they were looking for ONE witness, but maybe there were TWO witnesses.  If you wanna be more accurate, they're not drawings, they're composites.

            There are speculations Marina is in the business of organ trafficking.  Ever wonder why she looks so young?

             Ooh, speculations! You got me there! And no, I really don't think she looks particularly young, but even if she does appear younger than her age, I'm sure that being rich, living in 2017, and having access to plastic surgery and cosmetic procedures sure has nothing to do with it. It must be the blood of virgins. That's the only other option, right, Sherlock?

            This post is way off. The mccann composites are fabricated. So they may have been made to look like the Podestas. Read my previous comment:
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             The two efits are themselves debunked, as to being almost certainly fabricated. The Smith family had no idea how the man's face looked like and couldn't recognize him in a photograph (please watch from 18:51 of this video
             <a href="https://youtu.be/EIzjickYpEA?t=18m51s">
              https://youtu.be/EIzjickYpEA?t=18m51s)YouTube)
             </a>
             YouTube)), and the efits were released 6 years after the supposed disappearance, and created by private investigators the McCanns hired...
            </p>
            <p>
             So what we have is two fake efits. They are supposed to describe "one suspect" but it clear that these efits were fake. Thus it is up to us to make our own judgments. The efits look like two people, on two different computer programs, and look like the Podestas (including the mole on Tony's forehead).

            The spirit cooking is real AF. And the highest reward, costing $10K gets you Spirit Cooking.... so it's clearly more than just "soup".

             The Mccan composites are from before PG, and wikipedia had them before PG. So they were made to look like the Podestas before there was a PG scandal? Tell me more..

              Yes that is the likely scenario. I explain this mainly in part 4 of my pg series:

             <p>
              The elite pedo rings spread everywhere especially in the UK and USA. The elite pedos responsible for madeleine's death (there was no abduction) may have had some dealings with the podestas. So they could be sending them a message to keep inline, as a warning...

             And at least as far as the Madeline McCann thing, it seems like you are agreeing with me. You realize you pretty much just further proved my point about that, right? What you are suggesting makes it even MORE ridiculous that PizzaGate conspiracists have focused on those efits as being conclusive evidence of the kidnappers being the Podestas.

              The efits were fake to probably to make it look like podestas as a warning to them. This makes pizzagate more credible because podestas don't have to be in Portugal to be connected to the mccann case,  which itself is a giant elite pedo coverup

             It's clearly more than just "soup". It's not like you drive to some out-of-the-way location to meet a strange man in a cloak in a dark alleyway who hands you a Tupperware dish full of leftover crab bisque while darting his head back and forth in desperate paranoia. It's not just "soup". It's a themed dinner set up for powerful folks who have the money to be able to afford to throw away $10K to hobnob together and make business deals. That's all it is. Is it disgusting, greedy and alienating to the vast majority of America? Sure. But it's not ritualistic or occultish in any way, shape or form.

             I've obviously followed it more than you. And I also did something that none of you here seem to be capable of: I had an open mind about things, and although I fully believe that PizzaGate AND PedoGate are very real, I also am open-minded enough to look at other points of view instead of just focusing on biased reports by triggered liberals and evidence that only fits one side of the argument. Some of the evidence presented by online PizzaGate investigators is hyperbolic and unproven, and I am merely pointing that out. Why is that so bad? It doesn't make me a shill. It simply makes me an intelligent human being who questions things. But I understand your bewilderment. Anybody born after 1995 wouldn't know anything about logic and rational thought.

              The pictures of the Podesta brothers may have been leaked by an inside source who was trying to either threaten them or let people know they were involved. So the "it was a description of one man" does not debunk their possible involvement and the possible importance of those pictures. Secondly just because you found a description of spirit cooking does not mean that it is a genuine account of it. Also if you are sincere I would point out that your condescending tone isn't helpful. Maybe it's unintentional but it serves to put people off of your point.

               My thoughts exactly, Whatheheck. The sketches are not conclusive evidence of anything, but the explanation or debunking makes absolutely no sense in more ways than one. The "one man" somehow gained weight on his face by the time the second witness saw him, and the combined sketches happened to look a lot like the podesta bros? I've looked for a reasonable explanation for why two witnesses saw "one man" yet produced sketches of two very different looking men and have found none.

              Just another stuppid thing you state;  "It simply makes me an intelligent human being who questions things. But I understand your bewilderment. Anybody born after 1995 wouldn't know anything about logic and rational thought." Ofcourse there are many verry intelligent people born after 1995 out there!! You are just not one off them..

            Come on, it's a live event hosted by Marina Abramovic herself (who I'm sure after all these years has an inflated opinion of herself) and I'm sure she feels that her presence alone is worth $10K. Plus, she's also offering an opportunity to hobnob with other powerful folks. Anyone who donates $10K to a Kickstarter project obviously has money and influence. It's pretty logical to me, and I really doubt it's any more nefarious than simple arrogance and an inflated sense of self on M.A.'s part.

             It it really so surprising that I just joined Voat? I just went to go post this on Reddit this morning and found out about
             <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/pizzagate">
              r/pizzagate
             </a>
             being gone. So I came here and signed up so I could post this. Seriously, dude. Occam's Razor. Go look it up. It'll change the way you think forever.

              was gone just this morning? It has been gone for months. You are terrible at this. I will give you the same advice I gave the shill who was defending Bill Maher and saying that the Female teacher and her 13 yo boyfriend was ok because they stayed together when she got out of jail. Delete this screen name. Make a plan. Try to fit in. Be subtle. We wil still out you the moment you make your move. But this account is a goner. Cut bait and move on.
