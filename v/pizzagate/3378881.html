            I have seen unredacted book. Two things stood out.
           </p>
           <p>
            1. Number of powerful Jewish names (zero surprise) 2. Of more interest is the number of BRITISH names. So many of them. Most live in Chelsea and Fulham (part from eg Prince Pedo and royalty.) The address book seems overloaded with Brits of high influence. Inc Prince Andrew, Tony Blair and other ‘socialites’/people of influence)

            I agree with you goyim, if trump wasn't involved in any way and this was truly an opportunity  to "drain the swamp", Epstein would have been held at a classified federal location with 24/7 hand selected secret  service guards.

            Suppose Epstein was fake suicided and rescued either by his original handlers or others, and they now have him in Tel Aviv, the Tower of London, one of the many Trump Towers, the Ritz-Carlton in Riyadh, Moscow, Beijing or Pyongyang, North Korea. If it's his original handlers they inform the elites of the world of the fact and nothing changes. If it's others, they also inform the elites of who is now the new boss and the balance of power is altered. (This presumes Epstein holds undisclosed info far more damaging than what's known — sex with infants, cannibalism, occult sacrifices.)

             If anyone rescued him it would be the white Hats
            </p>
            <p>
             The ring he was in had no problem getting rid of people who might talk
            </p>
            <p>
             So I thinking since some reports say hung,
            </p>
            <p>
             And others say heart
            </p>
            <p>
             Will see what they come up with
            </p>
            <p>
             I like to think he was sat down in his dentist chair and given a cyanide tooth
            </p>
            <p>
             We will just have to watch what happens now
            </p>
            <p>
             Maybe there will be a Tony Rodham funeral
