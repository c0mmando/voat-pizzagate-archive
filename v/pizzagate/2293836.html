            I'm sorry you are going thru this. Be very careful since you asked for help protecting you. Some crazy person could offer to help you and it could be a trap.

            I might suggest a sort of Dead Man's Switch... write down everything you know about your research, any important documents (your choice of documents), make a list of where to post it/send it, a few dollars for making copies, seal the originals in an envelope and seal it in a way it can't be opened without the seal being obviously tampered with, and have a trusted friend hang onto it... and come up with a schedule for checking in (every other day, max 48 hours, something that won't seem out of the ordinary for contacting that person) and a code word or phrase to say you're okay (something that you might not always say to the person, but wouldn't seem out of the ordinary if you said/asked it).
I know a little bit about this... have one against a former employer... 59 pages (handwritten, each page date and time stamped, signed and initialed), 3 DVDs with duplicates, two data tapes, three pages of where to send everything, three pages (IIRC) detailing what each file on the DVDs contains and what time in the video its shown.  Admittedly, that's somewhat over-paranoid on my part, but at the time, I thought he was trying to come after me, and if I went down/he took me down, Scorched Earth policy goes into effect (as far as his little world is concerned).
Just stay safe... do what you have to to take care of yourself and the kids.
If it goes too far, a bug out bag (or three) is worth considering... have something arranged with a friend/family, and without a word to anyone, just grab the bags and go; your aunt's place in the country, your uncle in another state, someplace they wouldn't think to look for you... just remember, though... once you just "bug out" like that, that makes it that much harder to go back again... if they were just looking for you before, when you go back, they'll
            <strong>
             really
            </strong>
            be watching for you.
Best of luck, and somehow keep us informed (a message to an admin or someone trusted) of how things are going.

            I would highly suggest you contact the Oathkeepers.  They are former police, firefighters, EMTs that respect the Constitution and I know of someone on here that highly recommends them.  Someone I highly trust.

             If you know someone that is reliable in the oathkeepers sure/but the org as a whole has been compromised for a long time.  As with everything compromised/it's compartmentalized (many good oathkeepers at the grunt level) but from the top working downward there are problems.  Following the reports from Bunkerville and Malheur this came out.  This coming from those inside and outside the oathkeepers including former members.

             It is no different than many who work for child rescue orgs have no idea it is a front for child trafficking.

               It's like everything else carmen...I knew some really nice ppl that were masons...liked to drink a lot and do good deeds.  Know lots of nice catholics that would never kiddy diddly, muslims that are as peaceful and fair minded as anyone.  It's the upper levels that have to be watched.  All it takes is some key ppl in key places.  Know your chapter, know who you ask for help.  Make sure that ex's don't have connections to some in the org...things like that.

                Yes, that is what we have known from the beginning.  It is the elites that are the problems. They are the ones with the power to infiltrated the chapters of these organizations.  We have to do our homework.

            If you decide not to go dark, I would think there is a growing community willing to help you. It is those of us who want all the pedophiles in jail....general population.Remember from the Franklin coverup...William Colby, think that was the CIA director's name...said to get the story out there....how about your husband' s workplace...do you know of anyone there who could help you?

            I've Seen this many times in the bureau. Amy is most likely already dead/in trouble. And this proton email is just to see how many people will be investigating her death. Similar to Tzu day by Ben Swann. Remember the last time someone went dark? someone doesn't want any more attention for amy. Notice how she doesn't want to post herself in a video, yet She's completely willing to put her name on articles but not protect herself by coming out to the public? Be very cautious IDing yourself to whoever is setting this up.

            Very very sorry...know your rights when it comes to cps/can't stress this enough.  Just the mention of them should encourage you to be forearmed.  This is not to say live in fear/knowledge is power.  There are so many orgs where parents have come together to inform...that is my very best advice/and it is one these parents keep stressing.
