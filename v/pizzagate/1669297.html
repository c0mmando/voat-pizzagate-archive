            In the late 1990s, Virginia Roberts was recruited to perform a massage for Epstein while working as a $9-per-hour locker room attendant at Mar-A-Lago (at 15 yrs. old - Florida legal working age is 16). (Groomed and culled from Mar-a-Lago by Trumps lesbian/hebophile friend Ghislaine Maxwell, who implicitly works for Jeffrey Epstein). Roberts' father also worked at ** Mar-A-Lago**, which is located about 3 miles away from Epstein's estate, as a maintenance manager.
           </p>
           <p>
            During this same period, Epstein and Maxwell were repeat guests at Mar-A-Lago. In 2000, they hung out there with Prince Andrew, who arrived for vacation on Trump's private plane. That same year, the Palm Beach Post reported that Trump, Epstein, Prince Andrew, and Maxwell were all at a tennis tournament/celebrity event at Mar-A-Lago.

            This is a pizzagawhatever thread. We need to keep this main thread focused on pizza gate, if you are not specifically focusing on alefantis, podesta, clinton, or related by only a few degrees, than you are intentionally or unintentionally engaging in thread sliding, an intelligence tactic. However, some mods odd subjective hypocrisy only compounds this situation and thread's that should have been sorted out remain on the main forum, only reinforcing the rumors of thiel's ownership in this site. However relevant or altruistic your endeavor is this thread is only contributing to the mess the pizzagate forum has become and should be relegated to the pizzagatewhatever column. Better threads have been straight deleted by these mods. time to clean this circus up.

            I know. I love that they are all nervous. I want them on the edge of their seats every day until they are arrested. I want them to have to down a bottle of TUMS daily because they are sick to their stomach's with worry! I really hope Mike Pence isn't bad. I really liked him. But gosh, Chuck Shumer just looks like a creep. Especially when he has his glasses down his nose. You can just tell he's evil. Some people just can't hide it.

 Ivanka spotlights human trafficking
           </p>
           <p>
            President Trump this afternoon will hold a listening session on domestic and international human trafficking, including women and girls who are sexually exploited for profit.
           </p>
           <p>
            We're told that the sudden West Wing attention to the issue was driven by Ivanka Trump, the president's daughter and a huge West Wing force despite her decision not to take an official title at first.
           </p>
           <p>
            Why it matters: White House support for legislation on the issue could emerge from the meeting; West Wing aides are already talking about how to work with three senators who're attending. The effects will also be immediate: Trump is bringing the biggest spotlight in the world to a vital issue that's too often given short shrift.
How the meeting came about: Ivanka Trump and Dina Powell, White House senior counselor for economic initiatives, had a few meetings with some of the groups attending today's 2:30 p.m. session in the Roosevelt Room. "Ivanka recommended the meeting to the president and he immediately agreed, given what a horrible issue it is in the U.S. and internationally," a source said.
Who's coming from the Hill: Three Republicans senators who have been longtime advocates on the issue: Rob Portman of Ohio, Marco Rubio of Florida and Bob Corker of Tennessee.
Outside groups coming: National Center for Missing and Exploited Children; International Justice Mission; Thorn: Tech Innovation to Fight Child Sexual Exploitation, co-founded by Ashton Kutcher (who'll be represented by someone else).
Who's coming from the administration: The meeting is likely to include Vice President Pence, who has had a longtime focus on the issue; representatives of the Justice Department; plus policy guru Stephen Miller, Dina Powell and Hope Hicks, director of strategic communications.

            This is about narrative building. You have to slowly bring attention to the entire trafficking/pedo thing so that it is on the public consciousness before arresting people. People like us know what's up, but most wouldn't believe it if today there were elites getting arrested. So a steady drumbeat of stories about it being a problem are important in setting up an acceptance that it IS real when arrest start happening. He also has a press conference tomorrow so that should be fun.

             I agree.  The WH has to bring "the People" behind Trump to undertake the task. He is also trying to make the narrative about "protecting children".  I think yesterday when they announced that they would not defend Obama's transbathroom rule, they meant to get the response which I see the media talking about today on TV. .. and that is that "every child needs protection".   Also, as with the Milo , even some on CNN had to agree that pedophilia was "going too far".

            The FBI has received info for months that they have purposely burried and said nothing to see here. Any investigation was done a long time ago, and they were not allowed to move on it. They did not find out what was going on 30 days ago. They could have charged them all for crimes against humanity years ago most likely. They know already. That is why they murder reporters. Silence other FBI agents by murdering them and burning their house down.It is not that the need an investigation to figure out what is what. They have always known. They have always been in on it. They know  already. They chose to do nothing still. Let it sink in.

            You are rediculously dumb for thinking you can use such tactics and people will stop pushing. Your model of fighting the turh is obsolete. You are a parody of a disnfo OP.  'AreWeSure'..And you have been a member for 8 hours. Jake Tapper, is that you?

            I think devoting 6 hours (2:30-8:30) to human trafficking is pretty significant.  I mean, that's a long meeting, especially given Trump's track record of fast action and his no-time-for-nonsense persona. We will see.

            So much negativity guys! This is a good thing! We've heard that they are getting the little fish to catch the sharks. They need to have things done right before charges and arrests happen or the charges won't stick. Trump has been sticking to his promises. We've seen how many arrests have been made already. Give him a chance. He's only had a month in office and then we had to wait for Jeff Sessions. We knows Trey Gowdy and Jason Chavetz have begun a full investigation. I know this gets hard but I believe they know what they are doing. What frustrates me is knowing that Wikileaks has to have more emails and/or documents and won't drop it so we can bring those sicko's down.

             We heard they are going after the little fish, to catch the sharks, from a disinfo spook by the name of Steele. That is the spin. Possibly true, but more likely false. Gowdy and Chavetz do not matter. If the administration doesn't do something, nothing happens. If they do, we find out of the FBI and DOJ are all of the sudden clean again. Seems far more unlikely that anything comes of this. Even though no less than one third of our government apparatus deserves to swing from the gallows on closed circuit live TV, with no commentary allowed.

              If nothing comes of this then all of this research and spreading of information was for nothing. We can't think that way. If we do, then people will give up. Then it will be another Franklin cover up. We can't give up. If people do not stop fighting for this, then they can't continue to ignore it. It may take a while. We can't rush. They are probably behind the scenes getting plea deals where people turn on each other and they are gathering more evidence. We don't want a half ass job. When arrests go down, we want it to stick.

            This source and subsequent information seems off to me. Never heard of the guy, which is not reason for dismissal. Check out his terms of agreement tab. Now honestly consider whether you would or wouldn't want to engage with the website itself or any of the dossier information made publicly available.

             It doesn't matter. This /v/ has basically become prostitution arrests and non-pizzagate related shit anyway. The day will come and go just like the Sessions appointment and when nothing happens trump fanboys will just make more excuses. If you don't suck that trump dick you're guaranteed downvoats with pretty much every post you make here.

              Keep your eyes open to shill tactics. Too many pages have been dedicated to perfecting how to shill on the internet over the years, this has made the knowledge very extensive and people are paid as if its a real 8 hour job to enact the shilling to whoever is willing to pay. 
Shilling is not new either. The old word used was propaganda.

              I'm sorry you feel this way.  The opinion of a few loud voices do not represent the opinions of all users here.

              Don't forget, we have shills here forcing hard right narratives.  Those accounts yell the loudest.

              Speak your mind here.   Just do so civilly and with rationale and there will be no reason for people to downvote you for something like that.

             Pence is compromised so  I doubt he will allow this to happen. The state media would then have carte blanche to attempt to expose him.

             No more meetings? I'm fairly sure this is the first meeting for Human Trafficking
            </p>
            <p>
             They would have to do a real investigation first to get arrests. As much circumstantial evidence as we have it isn't anything that would be able to convict anybody on. An investigation of this magnitude would take a very long time
            </p>
            <p>
             A meeting on human trafficking is a great start. Its going to take a lot of time to have any of these high ranking politicians arrested. With how many people are implicated including our own CIA this is something that could stagger our entire government so it needs to be dealt with extremely carefully.

             I have nothing other than my own suspicion, but this seems like an inordinate amount of attention on human trafficking this early in his presidency for there to be nothing big going on.
            </p>
            <p>
             Did other presidents devote this much time to human trafficking?

              The attention being given is to traficking that includes prositutes, pimps and slightly underage girls being traficked. No pedophile arrest of note. This is not a traficking ring, but a an occult pedophile rape/torture/murder ring. Don't confuse the two. That  might be what they intend to do. Show a volume of efforts given to "traficking", a vague term. So far, zilch despite enourmous circumstantial material. Remember, arrest do not mean convictions. All people are asking for is arrest warrants being served, halting their opperations while there is a fair trial. Absolutely no movement in the are of this pedophile ring. Human traficking is a distraction IMO. As if this administration was obsessed with prostitutes. My assumption that this would be swept under the rug as it has through history, the perpetrators would continue with impunity, and they would make distraction arrest in a similar but quite different area have all come true.

               You really have no ground to stand on minimizing the deaths and suffering of trafficked and abused boys and girls who happen to be over age 12.
              </p>
              <p>
               While there seems to be a core of true "pedo" politicians who may also be satanic or whatever, there's a much larger number of compromised politicians and officials who degrade government and the whole
civilization by acceding to blackmail demands.
              </p>
              <p>
               Witness this week's ridiculous 4th circuit decision in "assault rifles." This is a 9th C decision from the 4th C, WTF?!?
Perhaps the blackmailers are using all their leverage while they still have it.
              </p>
              <p>
               I agree the more heinous crimes are most deserving of harsh justice but in the end the corrupt traffickers all deserve to burn. Their targets may range from minor players with planted cp or blackmail videos of them being seduced by 16yr olds, to those guilty of the worst ritual abuse and murder etc. All deserve justice but not all are the same.

               While that's true, you can't prosecute people for being in the occult. You need evidence of broken laws. Maybe starting with the trafficking from Haiti, Middle East, Mexico, etc. is the best place to start finding evidence of broken laws.
              </p>
              <p>
               It's also possible that they (Trump admin) think the public needs to be "eased in" to these revelations. A year ago I would have immediately thought these occult details would be impossible, but trafficking is something I knew and cared about.
              </p>
              <p>
               We need to keep praying for Trump and Sessions and Alex Jones and the children.
