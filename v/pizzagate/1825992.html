            I wonder why this comment you were replying to was deleted. Do you remember who it was? You're experiencing a lot of redaction related to this post. Whoever it was might have been the one who alerted the NCMEC board member to scrub the page his name was on.

            Perish the thought of letting that happen. I mean it. Ask for whatever help you need. The shilling and censorship are signs we are on target and doing damage. Get a Judo mindset and use the attacker's momentum to fuel your next move. We are not giving up.

            Try looking for the same url archived previously (a months or years older version). I did that to find the bio page of the US Gymnastics Team doctor busted for #ChildRape. The university he worked for had scrubbed their pages of all mention of him, but a version of it from two years prior still had it.

            I went thru 20 emails on Ami Bera mostly from the DMV and Podesta files and all but 2 concerned support for Mr. Bera in his tight re-election race. Two others which were duplicates concerned his father whose over zealous fundraising resulted in campaign funding fraud that ultimately resulted in a 1 year prison term.

            Believe this has been hinted at before but great job on getting the new leads and names. There have been connections to shipping containers involving Alefantis and others. The potential for the container to clinic was mentioned once. The idea was to create sterile mobile clinic's for medical treatment in poor countries.
           </p>
           <p>
            The problem is it looks much more likely these are used for organ harvesting, shipping of bodies, possibly narcotics as well. If they were really involved in charity work with containers to clinics they would have this posted everywhere. There would be stories about the good work. There would not be freaky KillRoom statements on the pictures.

            One thing that would help future posts would be a more complete headline. It's good to try to state your research thesis, especially how it's important to the investiation. This isn't just make sure mods understand, but also for future searches. You want key words in there that will allow people to find it again when they are researching.

            Wonder if those shipping containers are smaller on the inside than the outside?  Easy way to smuggle children in a false compartment.

            , I am flairing this "Potential Lead". I wonder if there are shipping manifests for those containers that could be FOIAed? I wonder if the number of containers sent actually equals the number used as clinics?

            The name is AMI, not AMY which might explain Wikileaks search results. Edit: Johnny's Half Shell is a fancy restaurant patronized by VIPs. Are you suggesting Mr. Bera and Mrs. Fiorini are connected to Pizzagate? I'm sorry but you haven't added to the relevancy of the original post by including them.
