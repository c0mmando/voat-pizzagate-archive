            Walt Whitman's day job was the editor of the Brooklyn Daily Eagle for a couple of years - a newspaper my Dad delivered when he was a kid.  The Brooklyn Eagle Building was on Fulton Street, now Old Fulton Street, right by the side of the Brooklyn Bridge, a spot where you can get some incredible coal-oven pizza.    I used to live on the street where the guy who designed the Brooklyn Bridge lived.  It's named for him now.  Took like 17 years to build.  He spent most of them home-bound because a ferry captain crashed into him and injured his leg.  They suspect it wasn't an accident because the bridge was going to hurt the ferry business.

Flood-tide below me! I see you face to face! 
Clouds of the west—sun there half an hour high—I see you also face to face.
           </p>
           <p>
            Crowds of men and women attired in the usual costumes, how curious you are to me! 
On the ferry-boats the hundreds and hundreds that cross, returning home, are more curious to me than you suppose, 
And you that shall cross from shore to shore years hence are more to me, and more in my meditations, than you might suppose.
           </p>
           <p>
            2 
The impalpable sustenance of me from all things at all hours of the day, 
The simple, compact, well-join’d scheme, myself disintegrated, every one disintegrated yet part of the scheme, 
The similitudes of the past and those of the future, 
The glories strung like beads on my smallest sights and hearings, on the walk in the street and the passage over the river, 
The current rushing so swiftly and swimming with me far away, 
The others that are to follow me, the ties between me and them, 
The certainty of others, the life, love, sight, hearing of others.
           </p>
           <p>
            Others will enter the gates of the ferry and cross from shore to shore, 
Others will watch the run of the flood-tide, 
Others will see the shipping of Manhattan north and west, and the heights of Brooklyn to the south and east, 
Others will see the islands large and small; 
Fifty years hence, others will see them as they cross, the sun half an hour high, 
A hundred years hence, or ever so many hundred years hence, others will see them, 
Will enjoy the sunset, the pouring-in of the flood-tide, the falling-back to the sea of the ebb-tide. 
........

Flow on, river! flow with the flood-tide, and ebb with the ebb-tide! 
Frolic on, crested and scallop-edg’d waves! 
Gorgeous clouds of the sunset! drench with your splendor me, or the men and women generations after me! 
Cross from shore to shore, countless crowds of passengers! 
Stand up, tall masts of Mannahatta! stand up, beautiful hills of Brooklyn! 
Throb, baffled and curious brain! throw out questions and answers! 
Suspend here and everywhere, eternal float of solution! 
Gaze, loving and thirsting eyes, in the house or street or public assembly!
           </p>
           <p>
            Sound out, voices of young men! loudly and musically call me by my nighest name! 
Live, old life! play the part that looks back on the actor or actress! 
Play the old role, the role that is great or small according as one makes it! 
Consider, you who peruse me, whether I may not in unknown ways be looking upon you; 
Be firm, rail over the river, to support those who lean idly, yet haste with the hasting current; 
Fly on, sea-birds! fly sideways, or wheel in large circles high in the air; 
Receive the summer sky, you water, and faithfully hold it till all downcast eyes have time to take it from you! 
Diverge, fine spokes of light, from the shape of my head, or any one’s head, in the sunlit water! 
Come on, ships from the lower bay! pass up or down, white-sail’d schooners, sloops, lighters! 
Flaunt away, flags of all nations! be duly lower’d at sunset! 
Burn high your fires, foundry chimneys! cast black shadows at nightfall! cast red and yellow light over the tops of the houses!
           </p>
           <p>
            Appearances, now or henceforth, indicate what you are, 
You necessary film, continue to envelop the soul, 
About my body for me, and your body for you, be hung out divinest aromas, 
Thrive, cities—bring your freight, bring your shows, ample and sufficient rivers, 
Expand, being than which none else is perhaps more spiritual, 
Keep your places, objects than which none else is more lasting.
           </p>
           <p>
            You have waited, you always wait, you dumb, beautiful ministers, 
We receive you with free sense at last, and are insatiate henceforward, 
Not you any more shall be able to foil us, or withhold yourselves from us, 
We use you, and do not cast you aside—we plant you permanently within us, 
We fathom you not—we love you—there is perfection in you also, 
You furnish your parts toward eternity, 
Great or small, you furnish your parts toward the soul.

            Are you not from a big city?
           </p>
           <p>
            You're basically discovering over and over again that this area is one of the prime business districts in Brooklyn and it's very dense and it has the transportation infrastructure to support a business districts.    It's right by courts and it's just over the river from Manhattan so you can still attract workers from NJ, SI and Queens. You can also find like 5 eyeglass places and many banks in that area.

            The Joralemon Street Tunnel is NOT the Brooklyn Battery Tunnel. At least not since 40's.   Because to a New Yorker, the Brooklyn Battery Tunnel is a highway tunnel not subway tunnel.  The Brooklyn Battery Tunnel is now named the Hugh L Carey tunnel, but nobody calls it that.  Carey was a former governor of NY and political ally of the Trump family from way back.
           </p>
           <p>
            The battery tunnel goes from the edge of Red Hook to the West Side Highway in Manhattan.  Right below the WTC

            Roberta's. Is in Bushwick well north and East of here by the Queens Border.   Probably a 20 min drive.   You can get some killer pizza around here though.

            Isn't Robreto's pizza in ths same neighborhood? Which is across the street from the original Boarshead packing plant. Their patio is Interesting: stacked storage containers for walls and a steel plate (on grade) floor?

            Seems I also recall a mural of a Campbell soup can, with a womans legs hanging out. The soup was "Gum Shoe". Also tagged by MS13.

            58 Joralemon St Brooklyn is listed as a 'museum' with a subway vent.  Wonder if it's the same kind of museum James Alefantis operates next to Trolley Amusement Park in Washington DC.

            "No one lives there, but things sometimes begin to stir after the block has gone to sleep. In the darkness, men in helmets and Day-Glo vests gather and murmur on the stoop. And in the aftermath of 9/11 the mysterious visitors had a surreal, dreamlike quality.

            ’’I’m a light sleeper, and a lot of times I’d hear something in the night,‘’ one next-door neighbor said. ’’I’d peer out the window and see six guys in yellow bomb suits lingering in front. It was kind of an odd thing to see these Martian-type individuals hanging around your stoop.’’

Definitely. There were service &amp; nypd folks going in and out (and guarding) the big black door during the recent subway explosion incident.
