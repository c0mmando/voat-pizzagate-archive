<p>&quot;Re ACORN, it seems to me that the analysis should be whether solicitation of crimes (election fraud, tax fraud, human smuggling, prostitution) is ACORN policy, or does the latest scandal reflect the &quot;stick it to da man&quot; attitude of the kind of street operatives ACORN attracts and recruits. As GF says, you judge them by what they do, not what they say. Either way, they need to clean up quickly or disappear: They are hurting the reputation of people far better than they are, whether or not you agree with the liberal agenda. And in fairness, when crimes are committed by, say, the CIA, we don\'t say the individual operatives dunnit: We say the CIA dunnit.&quot;</p>
