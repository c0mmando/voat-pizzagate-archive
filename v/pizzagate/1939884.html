            Many people have been discussing the 'cards' clue from FBIanon. I happened to run across this and found some interesting info....
This organization is large and international. It has an extensive network of offices in the US and globally in places like South africa and Thailand... "1on1" home services as well as "in center" school type services are offered. There are multiple centers including one in Alexandria, Va.
            <a href="http://www.autismva.org/resource/center-autism-and-related-disorders">
             http://www.autismva.org/resource/center-autism-and-related-disorders
            </a>
            This center is a special needs private school and is noted to be expanding.

           </p>

            Tuition stated at $68,000 year!

            </a>
            However the state autism site notes that services are provided to "foster children" and Medicaid recipients as well, through financial assistance and scholarships.

            these moms found the place and its website a little odd too:

            "The entire corporation is corrupted. I repeat; the ENTIRE corporation. They do not care about you, me, or the clients. I hope their business shuts down because they are out for money and nothing else. No matter what employees do to complain, wether its talk to HR, company directors, anonymous surveys, etc. nothing gets done or fixed. They continue to be rude to employees and use them as robots ready to replace them. The first RED flag is that they make you sign a contract that says you got to pay $600 for the training if you do not stay for a year. Every month it goes down $50... but still even when you wanna leave they are trying to make money off of you. There are genuine people trying to work here and make a difference, but they get stuck there because they cannot leave due to the contract. The Fremont CA office I was at was so dull and lifeless, most of the toys were missing pieces. There was holes in the walls for months that was never fixed. Management is rude to their employees talking down to them. Therapists have other lives, school, family, and other activities going on, but CARD does not care. It's there way or the highway,,,, literally. If you cannot accommodate them, they will tell you to leave because in their eyes they will easily replace you with another guinea pig. My administration was not fit to be upper management in my opinion. I have never been spoken to in such a rude manner by a superior ever in my life. When a therapist has school studies or family emergencies their famous line is "I want to be sympathetic but I cannot see it from your perspective, CARD is your priority". Managment only cared about their precious bonuses, not about the clients or trying to keep their employees happy. It's so sad because I wanted to stay at that job for a long time and help others, but I could not stand to work for such a corrupt company any longer.
Advice to Management
If you have a soul/heart you shouldn't be working for card. Actually care about your employees and your clients and you wouldn't have to constantly hire.  "

            We have seen many close connections with child-related agencies for Podesta and associates.... 
And have unfortunately noted that special needs children are particularly vulnerable (amanda kleinman of heavy breathing was a special education teacher).

            , aside from having the same acronym, do you have a reason to suspect this is what FBIAnon was refering to? If so, please repost with that theory clearly stated. If not, please repost on in
