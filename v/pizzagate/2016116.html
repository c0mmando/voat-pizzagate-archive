<p>Sunday Night’s Matt Doran goes undercover with Operation Underground Railroad to bring down Haiti child sex ring</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Their madam tells me that <strong>many of their customers are western humanitarian workers</strong> who’ve come here to help rebuild Haiti after the recent run of natural disasters...</p>
<p>The children are told that we are a planning an underage sex party for a group of <strong>wealthy Americans and Australians</strong>....
A meticulous operation that began with the infiltration of the dark web, and that will culminate in the take-down of high-level Haitian traffickers linked to the abuse of hundreds of school-age children....</p>
<p>Many of them are traded, as though commodities, to rival gangs, and put up for sale or rent in filthy, underground Haitian brothels. Some are loaded into trucks or buses and <strong>smuggled across the border to be used by tourists in the Dominican Republic</strong>....</p>
<p>All told, <strong>nine traffickers end up in handcuffs, and 30 children</strong> are placed into the care of experienced trauma counsellors....</p>

<p>If recent history is our guide, expect most, if not all of those &quot;in handcuffs&quot; to slip away.</p>

<p>Haiti Police Rescue <strong>31 Girls in Child-Trafficking Sting</strong></p>
<p>Among the arrested were <strong>9 adults, foreigners, including missionaries</strong> among them. </p>
<p>The investigation began in December and remains ongoing to uncover the true breadth of the operation that appears to include <strong>non-governmental organization and international elements</strong>. Assistance was given by fellow missionaries to police, which aided in the operation.</p>
<p><strong>Investigators believe the syndicate was preparing to take the children over the Dominican Republic border to then leave the island.</strong></p>

<p>O.U.R. has a 100% conviction rate due to the effectiveness of the hidden cameras they utilize, and that 100% rate is without any victim ever having to testify in court.</p>

By that evening, Commissioner Leger had, and has since, been saying <strong>12 adults were arrested</strong>. </p>
