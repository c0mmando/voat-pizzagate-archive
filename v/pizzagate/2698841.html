According to Pelicano he found more possible victims than he had on any other case, dozens. He used both threats and physical intimidation to keep the possible accusers silent. He also was a master at wire tapping and was meticulous at keeping both written, audio and video evidence. He worked for many questionable characters but he left the Michael Jackson investigation because he found information that was beyond disturbing and even the jaded Pelicano could not justify his participation in the defending of Michael Jackson.
 In this latest interview he describes how MJ did far darker things than what was just suggested in the allegations of the boy. In this same article Bert Fields the lawyer that runs the Michael Jackson estate seems to show sympathy towards Pelicano. Why would Bert Fields show sympathy to a man that in the same article claimed the former pop icon did far darker things than just rape children. Why would Attorney Fields even comment could it possibly be he knows exactly what Private Detective Pelicano is referring to and wants to prevent the details from ever making into the media. Or did Fields cover up for these possible atrocities?

            My impression from the article is that he's hanging onto info for two reasons: to maintain loyalty to some, and perhaps to explore the possibilities of making money off the info he has, after he gets out of prison

            First off, Anthony Pelicano is a POS. Secondly, whatever MJ did, Pelicano is equally despicable and guilty.
           </p>
           <p>
            While there's not a doubt in my mind about MJ being a pedo, there's lots of doubt about why this scumbag is talking. What is it for attention? Reminds me of that other POS Isaac Kappy. Oh, and Feldman. Definitely reminds me of Feldman.
           </p>
           <p>
            All I have to say is that if he has the evidence, or doesn't have the evidence, just say what MJ did. I don't want to play mystery guessing games and try to figure out what "dark" behavior means. Spit it out of shut up.

            the whole family is rotten to the core and they were all terrified of the patricarch joe i read a cdan where it sounded like kids were bussed off a movie set to neverland where producers and directors molested them and gave them expensive gifts to shut them up i think michael jacksons neverland was a playground for rich and famous hollywood pedo players and the fact that feldman wont say a bad word about him is because feldman is still very much a player in that ring that operates today

             We don't have any evidence that Feldman is part of an elite pedo group, correct? I know many dislike his methods, and his angels stuff is creepy, but nothing underage or non-consensual . I veer toward the opinion that perhaps michael spared him because he was too famous and he had plenty other kids to exploit. Feldman always says Jackson could be guilty, but not that he was made aware of.
            </p>
            <p>
             I'm not  anti-feldman, and I certainly don't blame him for anything that happened to Corey Haim, as they were both children and were both being chronically sexually abused by numerous powerful people in Hollywood. As far as why he hasn't come out with even more info, I believe they may have threatened his and his kids lives.
            </p>
            <p>
             On the other hand, Corey Feldman also says S.Spielberg is a great guy and he never saw any bad behavior with him.  Although that is possible if Steven primarily abused girls.  I'm open to possibilities, but at this point have no reason to think he's one of the sicko bad guys. He played a huge in bringing crucial attention to the important issue of  rampant pedophilia in Hollywood.

              The fact that Feldman doesn't condemn the King of Popping Cherrys, and idolizes wacko jacko to the point that everytime Corey "performs" with his shitty "band" he does a shitty pedo shuffle as a homage to a well-known and worshipped kidfucker is enough to make me dismiss anything he says.

               Where did he receive money? From  whom? How do  you know he's on drugs?  And hypothetically speaking, how do I know that Haims mom is not the evil one?

            from the article:
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             For example, Michael Jackson, who reportedly engaged his services around 1993 (via attorney Fields) — and whom Pellicano claims he "fired" because he was disgusted by truths even darker than those alleged in Jackson's molestation scandal. "I was offered $500,000 to tell the whole story by a tabloid, and I declined, even though, while incarcerated, I needed the money." Other questions regarding the Jackson saga are met with what may be the definitive Pellicano irony: "All of that would get too close to the truth, so, regretfully, I have to decline."
