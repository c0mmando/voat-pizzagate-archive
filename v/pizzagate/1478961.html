<p>This film features snakes and people with horns.   Now in 2010 Alefantis hired an artist by the name of Arrington de Dionyso to make a mural for Comet Ping Pong.

<p>This picture is a screen grab from what appears to be a promotional video of Comet Ping Pong on YouTube that was uploaded in 2010:

<p>Here is Dionyso claiming that he made the mural featuring people with horns holding decapitated heads, and you  can see it at Comet Ping Pong as well as the mural with the person with bird heads.

<p>If you browse around the artist\'s instagram, you\'ll see lots of orgies, lots of murder with snakes,  third eyes, horns, bird heads etc.   This one is particularly disturbing:

<p>Here is another where a person is being eaten by a snake while others watch in obvious pleasure.</p>

<p>This is not a smoking gun,  just another data point to make the case the James Alefantis is not some ordinary pizza restaurant owner that happens to be very politically connected.</p>',

            Just watched a film called Ava's Possesions-
            <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3727982/...has">
             http://www.imdb.com/title/tt3727982/...has
            </a>
            the same vibe as Alefantis film and theres a PIZZA PARTY reference linked to sex , ALso demon possesion , rituals ect. Might be good to check out also maybe we should do a thread of all pizza party references, books, movies, tv shows ect if there isn't one already

            Michael Stipe (Above, Me at the Zoo producer) of the band R.E.M. is an early benefactor and avid collector of the photography of Sally Mann, the one who did so many photos of her own children naked. A prosecutor once warned her (see article) that she could be prosecuted for 8 photos in just one of her shows.

            This is just the tip of the pyramid, everyone. I wrote a post in this forum  '

            ' 4 days ago. I had absolutely no idea that Alefantis had produced a film named Chapel Perilous. I mention 'CP' in part 3, and yes, I've realized 'Chapel Perilous' and CP share the same initials for quite some time-- but it's so much .. deeper than that. (That is seriously not a pun..)
           </p>
           <p>
            I.. .I... don't even know where to begin. But I also have been in the creative industry. I also think the acting is crap, and this is stupid, and yet.. I know exactly what they are saying in the film, and the fact that this guy is saying it means something much deeper than simply disgusting child abuse is going on.

            Those who've missed it, may want to give it a glance.. Those that passed over it, might want to check again.

            DNA merely explains the physical and not the metaphysical. Whereas 
they make no distinction between both practices. 
For example, what is psychology? - the study of the soul but we can't see the soul. We study it by observing human behavior and uniting the physical and metaphysical to get a better understanding. 
What is black matter? - we can't see it but we know is there by observing how visible matter behaves around it. - again we combine the physical and metaphysical.
Then you keep digging deeper into science and study sub atomic particles where the laws of physics cease to exist. ...Where a neutrino can be on one side of the universe and at the other at the same time.
The empirical model breaks down eventually in certain situations and that's where spirituality takes over.

            Raping babies is probably only the beginning of what these devils do with little children. If you honestly believe that crap is artistic expression maybe you should contemplate what's in your heart as well. Some of us can still distinguish light from evil. That sick shit is evil. I rather die of starvation than to make a living distributing that vile filth.

            Where do you think the artist's source of inspiration comes from?... 
If the art is disturbing it obviously comes from a Satanic muse. 
That's why that sick crap hangs from those sick people's walls. 
They gravitate towards it because is a reflection of their hearts.

            As a piece of film that stands on it's own, it's not bad.
           </p>
           <p>
            The fact that Alefantis was involved definitely presents a lot of evidence that helps this come full circle.
           </p>
           <p>
            Nobody would take a credit like he received and not understand, in detail, what was being produced.
           </p>
           <p>
            The fact that werkinonmahnightcheese has horns on his instagram icon is indicative or a ton of coded language being presented in this short film.  There is a lot more code here we are not aware of or do not understand.
           </p>
           <p>
            In summary, the fact that Alefantis is involved in this type of film maps very well to Heavy Breathing, Marina, and a host of occult influenced dynamics.
           </p>
           <p>
            While meaningless on its own, he's not funding short films about an elderly man that beats cancer.  He's clearly involved with projects that lean towards "acceptance of alternatives"

People like the Clintons, Podestas, Bushes, Obamas are all only mid level luciferians. 
At the top of the hierchy you have the ascended masters like Hilarion, Germaine, Metatron, Maitreya and others. And at the very top is Satan aka. Lucifer, the most illumined of all, Ai. 
Read the works of Madam Vlabatsky and Benjamin Creme at Lucis Trust (formerly know as Lucifer trust) It's all in there.

            Sun Araw most likely refers to Ra the Egyptian sun god who is none other than Satan. 
According to one of his interviews Araw is a Tagalog word that means “sun” or “day,” then he goes on to mention how he celebrates the perversion of the Sabbath by calling Sunday the day of rest.

             The elites. They believe they are literal descendants of the gods. Did you know the Rothschilds can trace their geneology back to Nimrod who started become a gibbor (mighty one/giant/Nephelim). Somehow he activated his nephilim genes that came from his ancestor Cain, whose real father was the serpent.

            Dionyso has some mental health issues how about we just say that. Decapitated heads seems to be a constant theme. Sometimes it's people he doesn't like. Sometimes it's just random people heads on the wall of a Pizza parlor. He enjoys drawing decapitated heads. People who are fascinated with decapitated heads have "issues". ;-)

            Hum, seems I was raised on people "hanging out" and associating with people who had common interests and beliefs. In other words, those you associate with are a mirror of your ideals and beliefs. My belief (art being in the eye of the beholder assumed) that this is all depraved, sick stuff. You can have it and all that goes with it. Disgusting and certainly not enlightenment or doing anything to make the world a better place.

            This is a really interesting find.
           </p>
           <p>
            the title can be reinterpresed as "a dangerous place of worship".. and as someone noted, the initials are CP, which you can use your own imagination what else CP could stand for.
           </p>

            the opening scene shows, hanging from the rearview mirror, a black triangle with a hand inside, and an eye in the palm of the hand, with the word "REVOLT" underneath.
           </p>
           <p>
            someone else want to continue to unpack the symbolism found in the movie? from a culture vector point of view, this is not about pedo stuff, it's about a FAITH related to OCCULT.
           </p>
           <p>
            in a presentation on extreme abuse (
            <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLBoiSbl9GM&amp;t=3112s">
             https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLBoiSbl9GM&amp;t=3112s)
            </a>
            )
the presenter spoke of 3 related legs that extreme abuse stood on.
           </p>
           <p>
            1 - Pedo Porn rings
2 - Occult theme
3 - Mind control
           </p>
           <p>
            this video is all about number 2, and perhaps alludes to number 1 through the title. number 3 is exhibited when the serpent pops out of the box and the guy begins accepting commands from the "preacher". Really pushing the interpretation, but you could fit it in there, which is interesting.

            perilous
Something that is dangerous or very risky can be described with the adjective perilous. If you are driving in a blizzard, you may kick yourself for making such a perilous journey.
The adjective perilous comes from the Latin word periculum, meaning dangerous. Words from the same root include peril, a noun meaning a dangerous situation, and imperil, a verb meaning to put in danger.

            chapel
A chapel is a place of worship. It's usually smaller than a church, and it has its own altar.

            Well, I might not have picked it up from the other way around. In other words, I might not have noticed the head being his head. So, join the club.

            On an unrelated note, I think that today has been a good day for the community. We've made some huge strides. We have a basic list of Clinton Foundation activity plus the shipping idea. It's all fitting together.

            I am trying to interpret the true meaning behind this seemingly stupid video. It's about reincarnation of Moses.
           </p>
           <p>
            Jews actually do believe in reincarnation;
            <a href="http://www.aish.com/jl/l/a/48943926.html">
             http://www.aish.com/jl/l/a/48943926.html
            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            So Moses (a messiah) is reborn in a suburban neighborhood and works online. He is clearly researching something occult (Is that a picture of Eve or Lilith with the serpent?). The guy who visits is some kind of messenger bring the real news of who he really is; the reincarnated Moses. He has a hand with an eye in the palm in a triangle on this rear view mirror (mirrors are special to these people because they are gateways or represent the 'other' world).
           </p>
           <p>
            Like a vampire he has to be invited in. Once inside he gives the reverse J hand gesture symbol. Not sure what this means. It might be a sign of the reverse for John the Baptist or more likely  (since this is more Kabbalic) a symbol for one of the archangels? I don't know.
           </p>
           <p>
            The black friend is clearly in on it and helping out as is the band Sun Araw (Ra the Sun god).
           </p>
           <p>
            He gets horns when it is revealed he is the reincarnation of Moses and the messenger knows a lot about his personal life. They clearly know each other from a previous life.
           </p>
           <p>
            Any help interpreting the rest would be appreciated.

              Adam was lonely in the garden. After Adam attempted to couple with all the other animals, it was decided by the Elohim (gods) that Lilith should be created for him out of the same earth as his equal. When Lilith refused to obey and lay under Adam she was cast out of the Garden. She was later pursued to return to Adam and refused. As punishment she was cursed to have 100 of her children killed daily by YahWah. The exact story varies depending on the source document. As revenge she would kidnap and kill children of Adam and Eve. Caine is her son with Samael (the devil). Together they form a Satanic Trinity.

               The Adam and Lilith is the Satanic version of the garden of Eden. 
I'm pretty sure the elites teach that Lucifer and Yeshua are brothers and that Lucifer wants to liberate humans from the oppressive God by establishing his own kingdom where do what thou wilt is the law. 
What is true about their version is that Adam did look for a mate with all the animals of the field first. Among them must have been the serpent, After all, he was the one who named it nachash (the shining one).  Only after he could not find a suitable mate among them, then God cause Adam to sleep and used his own substance (bone, flesh) to fashion Eve. 
Just as Eve came from Adam, we (humanity) come from God. 
Adam and Eve became one flesh (united) and so too must humanity become One with God. 
That's why marriage is so sacred. It literally speaks of God's plan for humanity.
And that is why Satan hates marriage and has always looked to distort it through homosexual marriage, divorce, and fornication. 
This is also why Satan hates humanity. We literally have access to replace him in the heavenly hierchy. He once was the most beautiful of all creations. Now we have the potential to replace him and become Sons of God (the glorious images of God) ruling alongside with Him for eternity. 
I truly believe that after this creation God will make many others where those who do the will of God will have rule and dominion over them. That's just my personal opinion though.

            The cosmic serpent refers to the DNA helix in this video BUT it used to mean the spinal cord before the discovery of DNA (which proves what BS this all is). Occultist explain this by saying they always knew and science just caught up to the ancient wisdom. Well okay, extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence.

             Science and Witchcraft are more related than you care to think. You should google and watch YouTube videos about the Kundalini Spirit. They believe they can awaken the coiled serpent in their spines. 
Furthermore, the empirical model was devised by none other than a satanist.

               Dr. John Dee, the immanent authority on Hermeticism and Kabbalism in England laid the ground-work for the formation of the “Rosicruician Order.”* He most certainly initiated young Bacon into the Order, as evidenced by Jacob Cats’ engraving (1655) of Dee passing the “Lantern of Rosicrucian Light” to Bacon—over an open grave.

                Neither were actual "Satanists", whatever that really means. They were Christian Hermetic Gnostics and likely helped found what would become Rosicrucianism. There were many ancient Mystery Cults which are more properly called Astrotheology religions than anything Satanic. They believed that the stories of the Bible, Torah, and other ancient texts weren't literally true but contained truths about the cosmos through allegory such as the Procession of the Equinox and movements of the moon and Sun. They believe that all the things in the bible are literally true just not the way you think they are true. Like Jesus feeds a Wedding Party with 2 fish and 5 loaves of bread it's literally true. It's an allegory not literal. He is really representing the 2 fish of The Age of Pisces and the 5 stars of the Constellation of the House of Bread (Bethlehem, a town which didn't exist until 300 years later). The Wedding being the Chemical Wedding (melding) of Humanity (man and woman; Christian Rosencrux) and the stars, which is one of the most important allegories of Rosicrucianism.
               </p>
               <p>
                I don't think they believed in Blood Sacrifice or any literal part of the bible. That is more of a Jewish Ritual Murder.

                I believe there is a small surviving Jewish sect which engages in Child Sacrifice and Ritual Murder. While it is important to note 99% of Jews are innocent of this. We need to distinguish these innocents from the Evil Satanic Jews who have recruited Gentiles and even Blacks. I am not sure what to call them.

                 Research mystery religions. It is common practice for these types to infiltrate religions.
For example Babylonian teachings mixed with Judaism became Kabbalah, Babylonian Talmudic teachings (look up pulsa dinura).
Paganism infiltrated followers of the way and became the Roman Catholic Church. 
Divide and conquer has been the tactic since 1/3 of the angels were kicked out of heaven and since the serpent deceived Eve. 
Regardless of that, at the root of the problem is Pride.

                <p>
                 BTW the Bible calls these people the synagogue of Satan who say they are Jews but are not.

            I saw it with no preconceived emotion built up, and it was fine for me. I'm not a satanist but it was pretty intriguing and interesting the way the man was persistent on giving that presentation. It was different forsure different, and a bit of a cliffhanger but i can see how it won.

            Regarding the painting of 3 people having sex over an infant; I have a feeling these "artists" aren't painting fantasy. They are commemorating real events.  It is the artists interpretation of a real event and the people involved. In these types of art there is sometimes a code to tell you when and who was involved known only to initiates.

            Like the children tied up in the tiled theme room. It turns out that below Connecticut Ave there are tunnels. In one area there is a tiled room which is similar to that painting. They are looking back at someone seeing something only those who were there know what or who it is.

            Like at the end of Big Girls Cry by Sia; the girl who goes through mind control torture sees something awe inspiring. Is it enlightenment? Is it her death? Is it angels? Is it cultists about to kill her? Is it aliens? I don't know but if the camera could pan out ....

             The artist that painted that was a split personality off of a main personality - female - that survived Satanic abuse.  She is more or less giving testimony about what she actually witnessed.  There is a lot of info on her if you look for it - try Vigilent Citizen.

             If you look a the artist's instagram, did you notice there are quite a lot of pictures of very young children.   Did anyone else cringe at the pictures of him on his travels where he is with school kids?   This guy obviously is really into orgies and murder.   Whether that is because he wants to do that himself, or he experienced it himself is unclear.   It maybe that his art is a way of working through what was done to him,  or he might be really into this stuff for real.  I just don't know enough about it.
   Either way, if I were looking for artist to paint a room-wide mural in my family-friendly pizzeria, this guy would not have been even considered.

            Watching this crap reminded me that these people believe that 97% of our DNA (Junk DNA) is in a dormant state because we have not yet 'evolved' to become 'enlightened ascended beings'. They believe our dormant DNA has the potential to be activated and turn us into gods. To activate it we must allow ourselves to be open to demonization and become the 'others' - the progeny of the serpent.

              I believe there is a very simple explanation. Humans were made by God using clay from the earth. We are literally clay vessels fashioned in the likeness and breath of God. However, when men disobeyed God, the serpent's evil inclination became part of us. The more evil we become the more like the snake humanity becomes. That is why you have people like the Podestas and the Clintons who have completely given themselves over to be used by evil.  Maybe even to the point were they have lost their humanity and have been taken over by the snake. 
More or less like a zombie snail.

             Not Moses but is believed the mark God gave to Cain as part of the punishment for killing his brother were a set of horns so other animals knew not to kill him. Cain became like a beast of the field. Generations later, it is said that Tubal Cain, one of his descendants accidentally shot him with an arrow while hunting for game with his father lamech. 
Tubal Cain according to Rashi refined Cain's craft by inventing better weapons for killing. 
Flavious Josephus says that Tubal Cain exceeded all men in strength (became a gibbor) or whose DNA somehow changed to become a Nephalim. 
According to legend the nephalim are the ones who taught men farmachia (science) and how to build weapons (technology).

              Moses has horns. QRN conotates horns. 69 times in the hebrew bible. From the horns on the alter to job's daughter. There are dozens of hebrew words for light and rays of light. The author chose QRN. Hab 3:4 is also a "horn" designation.

               The word used in original Hebrew is Qaran.
It came about when Moses was coming down from Mount Sinai (and the two tablets of the testimony were in Moses’ hand as he was coming down from the mountain), that Moses did not know that the skin of his face shone (Qaran) because of his speaking with Him.
              </p>
              <p>
               Notice that context in which the word Qaran is used, &lt;The skin of his face&gt;.
Imagine literal horns protruding from the skin of his face... You must take into account the context in which the word is used and when you do it makes absolutely no sense because horns do not protrude from the skin of the face. 
Furthermore, Moses has just come down from the top of Mount Sinai where the very glory of God manifested, and where God used a rock to shield Moses from his glory or he would have died. When Moses came down from the mountain his skin was literally glowing (Qaran) , which in itself means the very authority of God was with him.
This is verified by Maimonides (Rambam)  and other greats sages Nachmanides. 
Also, throughout scriptures horns are used to describe authority and even empires.
              </p>
              <p>
               Here is an example from Psalm 18:2,
The LORD is my rock, and my fortress, and my deliverer; my God, my strength, in whom I will trust; my buckler, and the horn of my salvation, and my high tower.
              </p>
              <p>
               How can salvation have a literal horn?... 
It doesn't mean that. It means God is the authority of salvation.
              </p>
              <p>
               Chances are it was a silly mistake done by Jerome during translation and since the vulgate was the official translation at the time the sculpture of Moses got horns.

                There is no mistranslation. The story conveys a message about time, great amounts of time (2160 years cycle of the Procession of the Equinox). The story of Moses never actually happened. It isn't literally true. The story is an allegory regarding the movement of the stars through the vernal equinox as Earth processes from Taurus (the Bull) to Aries (the Ram) around 2000 BC. Moses is representative of the coming Age of the Ram by the Ram's horns which is why the Jews blow the Shofar and used to engage in Blood sacrifice as Moses did when he ordered all the worshipers of the Golden Bull to be killed turning his most fervent followers to slaughter the idol worshipers of the old age of the Taurus the Bull, including their own families.  Moses is an evil immoral disgusting character and has nothing to do with any God of Salvation, Truth and Goodness, but an horrible evil petty vindictive God of slavery, rape, torture, mutilation, murder and child sacrifice.

                 You're either a fool, a shill, or luciferian zombie.
Keep in mind that Satan's downfall took place when pride was found in his heart. 
You sure sound like a heart full of pride and is in your nature to speak the lies of your Father.

                   You are very quick at quoting Satanic versions of the past yet call Biblical stories false allegories and God to be a vengeful God. That, plus your rant about white supremacy in one of your earlier comments says quite a lot about what's in your heart.

You act and regurgitate doctrines of Satan so naturally. So it comes as no surprise to find the amount of hatred that's in your heart.

                   Not my words. God's words. But keep believing the lies of Satan if you chose. As for me I chose to believe Yeshua because I've seen with my own eyes how demons quake and are bound by His name.

                   And I've seen how a person can go from looking perfectly normal to looking like a beast (literally) who wants nothing more than to see you dead. - Like those reptilians you believe in, except we crazy Christians call them demons. 
Those types of experiences tend to change your outlook of reality. So maybe you should get some experience before you copy-paste something you found from another website.

                    Okey dokey, boy have you got things all messed up. Science and the Scientific Method is what I used to determine the truth. The universe is made up of rational bits and pieces and I use science to understand how it all works. I can create a model of a system and then take it apart to see the evidence of it's machinations. I don't believe anything.
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    Serious question; Have really seen a demon or was it a mentally ill person having issues you didn't understand? Perhaps, a person who was in desperate need of medical attention which you saw as "possessed"? Humans are animals. Our brain function is what we call our personality and that can malfunction due to many factors from dehydration, drugs/poisons, overheating, stress, physical damage or malformations. The person you saw should seek the help of a medical professional not some minister, witch doctor or priest.
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    Also, what is it with you people and demons, reptilians and aliens? Demons, reptilian or whatever you want to call them don't exist. Or for that matter, I have never seen one or had any credible evidence of reptilians, demons, spirits, aliens, Yeti, or the Loch Ness Monster. So until I have evidence, that is, tangible, provable, uncontroversial solid, reproducible evidence, I am not believing in any of it.
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    I don't believe one word about the Talmud (which is what I was quoting), the Quran, the myth of Thor,/Zeus/Rama, the Bible, the Upanishads, the Lord of the Rings or any other book unless a claim made in any of those books can be proven beyond a shadow of doubt.
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    I was simply reciting what others have written, because that is precisely what I am doing; Retelling the story of what others believe. I am a history buff. I like to read stories and retell them. That is all. It's a hobby.
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    Rational scientific inquiry forms what I know about the universe. I don't believe in anything. I can't be swayed by what I read in a book. It has to be derived from first principles like 1+1=2 or logical proofs like 'I think therefore I am".
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    You clearly believe in God and take the entire religion of Christianity at face value; spirits, demons, devil, angels and all. Well, it isn't real. The bible itself is fairly obviously written as an analogy and allegory not to be taken as literal suspending all the Laws of Nature.
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    Most of the things in the Bible which seem supernatural actually aren't at all. They are just not literal. The miracles Jesus performs aren't miraculous at all. They all have rational explanations. For example, he turns water into wine. Here Jesus is taking on the personification of the sun or sky god which rains on the field which makes the grape vine grow. Then people can crush the grapes to make wine. Simple and rational. He isn't some cheap magician. It's a primitive way of teaching people the Water Cycle before proper schools were put in place which is what religions did before states evolved enough to take over the education of the populace.
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    However, Jesus is a very moral and good person. I follow what Jesus said because he was a good person. I don't care if he was "the son of God" or if he was just a man. The words attributed to Jesus that I have read I judge to be good and I accept them as my guide for living a good life.
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    You sure like throwing those labels around. Also, I am not a White Supremacist. I am more of a White Inferiorist. I like Blacks, Asians, etc. I just happen to completely disagree with forced mass immigration into the Western World and with the manipulations of Marxists, Globalists, International Finance and Corporations. I an anti-Globalist. You can call me whatever you want. It changes nothing.

            someone did a video on the small number of people who actually voted, can't remember who, but clearly 'connections' were involved.  Having some experience with the film industry myself, it's clearly not your typical prize winning stuff.

            Yeah, so James Alefantis is not a regular dude. Clearly the occult symbolism on his sign and in his art is no coincidence.

             It's bizarre and kind of goofy at the same time. It feeds into my personal belief that while these people like to revel in Satanic art and imagery, they don't actually believe in any of it. It's just role play for them.

            That is where to focus, on the taste of the folks at Comet taken as a whole. Many of my friends are actually versed in the occult and they are all on the side of good. In that world, its like two sides of a war using many of the same tools and weapons.

            Really? So if you sent me your picture and then I made 100 paintings of you being dismembered, eaten by dogs, tortured, decapitated, gang raped, drawn and quartered, skinned alive, burned alive, hands and feet cut off, one hand and one foot cut off but on opposite sides and finally one with you after I drove a silver spike through you heart would you still think that was "art"?

            Absolutely. I feel like I'm stuck in the nineties sometimes...And I'm happy there. FYI in regards to the post. Nothing wrong with opening your third eye, just depends what you look at.

               I can't bear it. This stuff is really having a negative effect on me. i've been getting depressed, crying all the time, having trouble sleeping. we've all seen so many horrors and nothing that even compares to what innocent children are enduring every day.

            I'm only halfway through this, and it already seems like a movie about initiating an unwilling stranger into a cult.
           </p>
           <p>
            Edit: WOW shit goes nuts at at 9:00
           </p>
           <p>
            This acting, scene staging, everything is fucking terrible, do we have any people with experience with cult recruiters? Would like to know if this movie is any kind of accurate portrayal.

               Sorry, didn't mean to insult you. I should have explained. I meant dumb as in literally unable to speak or understand. We are the profane or uninitiated. We don't have eyes to see (blind) or ears to hear (deaf) or mouths to speak (dumb) and so are literally unable to understand the messages which are right in our face. I am blind, deaf and dumb too. I am only starting to see what all this means just like you. Therefore, since you aren't a pedo this movie is looks dumb.

                That depiction of that type of mental and psychic seduction was clunky and cliche.  Makes me think a lot of the ritual parties are guffaw inducing more than awe inspiring.

            I just want to defend Dionyso here because I know him personally and he isn't in this. He's a hard working low income progressive that after 20 years finally caught a few breaks in the art world. His band is called Old Time Relijun and he is well versed in occult and esoteric stuff. He is not implicated in this.

              Those abstract depictions of masks are not what you say. There are plenty of more compelling areas of this investigation than this. Whatever, look into Dionyso, you'll get no substantial connections. If you do, I'll be open to them.

               Do you know that his current employer, the Yves Saint Laurent brand, was founded by Yves Saint Laurent and his gay partner Pierre Bergé, which were/are both known pedophiles, and, at least for YSL, a proud satanist?

                He is not "employed" by Saint Laurent, they purchased a single design from him years ago. That is routine contract work, much like the mural. The point is that it doesn't implicate him in any involvement in actual pedo activity. Moreover, you haven't provided any citation for your claims about Pierre Berge. I would gladly review it.

                The art is abstract art. It depicts masks. That is not an opinion, sir.

                 A certain Facebook status needs to be updated then.

                 Sure, I'm not saying otherwise. I guess that's why I never posted anything on the subject so far. There's a saying in my country though, something like "Tell me what you like and I will tell you who you are".
                </p>
                <p>
                 I feel I'm stating the obvious here but, if I was an artist obsessed with sexual acts, long dicks, beheaded bodies, blood, strange creatures/symbolism, etc., I wouldn't be surprised at all to see people accusing me of being involved in weird/creepy stuffs, like the people who enjoy my paintings. Not to mention the music.

                <p>
                 I haven't provided any citation for my claims about YSL either, is this different? Anyway, according to the French news magazine VSD, quoting a French priest who was trusted by the inhabitants of the medina quarter in Marrakesh, "festive events" in which minors would have been engaged in prostitution were organized at the Villa Majorelle, a property of YSL/Bergé.

              Dionyso points out that his art will show blood when necessary. You can't indict someone on bad taste. And bad taste is subjective.

               Correct. You can't indict someone on bad taste. And nor should you. But I said "call a spade a spade" not Arrest the Mother Trucker! Get it? It's "art" but you also call it a sick obsession by someone with some serious mental health issues:

              Speak for yourself. I think this artist is very suspect and I have already dug quite a bit on him. If he doesn't like it that's too bad. You don't let a stranger produce your dumb small film, clearly these two run in the same circles. If he wants to come clean he can explain how and why he knows Alefantis and what cult rituals they have in common.

            No, he's not just some ordinary restaurant owner that happens to be politically connected. What else is he involved in? I bet if we look into his  closest affiliates a pattern will begin to emerge.

             Good question.  So many of these people do not behave rationally.  A standard pattern is the unquenchable desire to broadcast clues as to the true nature of what is going on.   Is JA himself a victim?  I would not be surprised.  I certainly think there is a good chance his mural artist was.
