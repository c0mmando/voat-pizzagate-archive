            In interviews both Corey Feldman and Elijah Wood state that a big name in Hollywood is deep into pedophilia. Corey even goes so far as to say that he can’t name names but that he’s watching. So now we have a gender too, and apparently this person is also powerful. The Weinsteins ( let’s not forget about Bob over at Miramax) have at least backed, if not directly overseen, well over a quarter of movies being made for the last 15-20 years. If that isn’t powerful I don’t know what is. There are stories about both of these jokers to be sure. Look at the movies that people like Feldman and Elijah starred in and look at the people running those films and who they rolled with. Maybe Harvey is just the tip of a nasty iceberg. Maybe just a red herring to let the others know. I don’t have any trouble believing this shit. The guy who directed transformers was accused of making unwanted sexual advances to young boys etc. There seems to be a whole network of these fuckers out there. Perhaps Harvey was just low hanging fruit.

            There's always been wide spread and very serious complaints about HW, and not just about his sexual practices. He's long had a rep as a bully and a slovenly pig. Note the TC character in "Tropic Thunder." Hollywood will put up with anything as long as the perp makes $$$ for investors.
           </p>
           <p>
            Once he is no longer seen as a strong financial asset, the powerful are not as willing to put up with such a huge headache. Wonder why almost all award winning films and actors have a HW connection? So HW is forced to resign from his company. Meaning he'll be working behind the scenes as his brother and partner will be the public face of the company. Notice nobody is discussing his brother's sexual rep.

            There is so much insanity going on right now and weird questions being asked and crazy secrets coming to the surface that I predict something even bigger is going to occur, to drown them all:

            Is Hollywood throwing everyone a bone, I wonder. Ok internet: you can have piece of shit Weinstein, if you leave the real PEDO pieces of shits alone...(Wruce Billis, Sharlie Cheen, every single director and producer...etc.)
           </p>
           <p>
            Either that, or its the usual distraction from everything else going on....its getting to be like Inception with the distraction from the distraction, from the distraction...
