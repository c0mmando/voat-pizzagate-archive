<p>Lawsuit alleging sexual abuse and a cover up has been filed against the daughter and son-in-law of the president of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.</p>
<p>The lawsuit was filed in federal court by six unnamed people listed only as &quot;Jane Doe&quot; and &quot;John Doe&quot; against unnamed &quot;Doe 1 Male Defendant&quot; and &quot;Doe 2 Female Defendant.&quot; However, Brenda and Richard Miles\' attorney publicly disclosed their names after the lawsuit was filed and said they vigorously deny the allegations.</p>
<p>several of the plaintiffs are not comfortable being known</p>
<p>&quot;Victims need to be listened and heard and have a voice. I think now there’s a chance some members of the Mormon community will believe us. I’m certain there’s some who will not because of who the defendants are,&quot; said a woman known in the lawsuit as &quot;Jane Doe 2,&quot; who alleges she was sexually abused as a child.</p>
<p>The lawsuit alleges a man only identified as &quot;Perpetrator&quot; in the court papers sexually abused his children. It also claims a 16-year-old babysitter was both a victim and perpetrator of abuse (who later committed suicide). Then it accuses the Miles of abuse.</p>
<p>“DOE 1 MALE DEFENDANT and DOE 2 FEMALE DEFENDANT led what they called ‘touching parties’ at their home and at the Perpetrator’s home. These ‘touching parties’ were sometimes attended by acquaintances and friends of Defendants and Perpetrator,” the lawsuit states.</p>
<p>The lawsuit alleges the children were sexually abused repeatedly. The children disclosed to their mother their abuse and claimed “DOE 1 MALE DEFENDANT, who was the Second Counselor of this LDS ward at the time,” was one of those who abused them. It also alleges “DOE 2 FEMALE DEFENDANT” is the daughter of an LDS apostle.</p>

            Where does a "church" get the money to build and spread so far and wide? Could it be the CIA is somehow involved in this since SRA is used under the guise that God will punish the children if they say anything about the abuse. We need to keep digging into this organization.

              this is correct. Every 4th sunday they actually KNOCK ON YOUR DOOR at home and ask for your tithing offering. And they even do a "tithing audit" at the end of the year to make sure you're all payed up. If you're not you can't go to the temple.

                it's a requirement to pay 10% of your gross income to the church. If you don't you are disobeying the commandments and living in obstinate sin towards god. Even children must pay their tithing. There is no acceptable excuse for not paying. It's considered stealing from jesus.
               </p>
               <p>
                They say if you can't pay pay anyways in order to receive the blessing of the lord and then the lord will provide.... What they really mean is if you're lucky and you pay when you can't afford to the bishop will bring you a bag of groceries so you don't starve but you'll get to keep your temple recommend and avoid public shaming.

                 Settlement is different than audit. Settlement is NOT REQUIRED. No one opens your books, no one looks at account statements.

                  Are you even mormon? Are you a minor? Have you been to Settlement? It's absolutely an audit. Maybe you have a pussy bishop. Mine were always very diligent about tithing.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  Settlement is also absolutely required if you want to be a member in good standing and go to heaven and the temple -even for your own wedding or a wedding of a family member.  They may or may not look at account statements, that is up to the member and their bishop. The bishop CAN and sometimes DOES question the validity of a members declaration of full tithe.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  "Payment of tithing is a core doctrine of the church for all members, including children. Church members must declare themselves to be "full-tithe payers" in order to receive a temple recommend and attend one of the church's temples. However, that is done in a separate meeting from the tithing settlement.[2]"

                   Your don’t have to go to tithing settlement. It’s not an audit. They just ask you did you pay a full tithe and then you’re done. 
Temple recommend interview they just ask you and then you are done. No books open.

             It absolutely involves the current president of the church because one of his daughters (and her husband) are named as abusers in the case. And it wasn't debunked in 1986 -- it was swept under the rug. I (and others) know the back story very well.
            </p>
            <p>
             Obviously, the church-controlled "Mormon newsroom" won't be the best place to get the whole story. The mission of that group is only to protect the 'good name' of the prophet, his family, and others involved.
            </p>
            <p>
             I respect innocent believers of all religions, but will never be a party to denying or covering up crimes among church leaders and members. It's time they (just like Catholic priests and others) are brought to justice. This case finally offers that potential. The problem is much deeper and more complicated than you can imagine.

               . If you're interested in facts and details of this case, there are plenty of documents in circulation. One such record implicates the current church president (and his cronies at church headquarters) in a
               <em>
                cover-up.
               </em>
               I'd be happy to send that to you via PM, if you wish.

              So not following the connection. The President is the Church was not involved at all. He isn’t in the lawsuit, and frankly the lawyer representing the case has brought other suits to the Church because of a potential that recent changes to the law would retroactively change statue of limitations. It does not involve the President.

            R.H., a 21-year-old woman, alleges she was given a number by which she was known during these religious rituals and she was never called by name but only by that number.
           </p>
           <p>
            “This horrific religious doctrine and religious rituals as performed on plaintiff consisted of plaintiff, beginning at the age of 8, having a bag placed over her head, led out of her house by representatives of the defendants, placed in a vehicle and being driven to an unknown location,” according to the lawsuit.
           </p>
           <p>
            Once reaching the unknown location, the bag would be taken off the girl’s head and she would be disrobed and required to engage in sexual acts with the defendants while others watched as part of the ritual.
           </p>
           <p>
            “Warren S. Jeffs told (R.H.) that if she told anyone of these encounters, God would destroy her and her family immediately,” the lawsuit states. He also reportedly said that if she cried during the ritual, “God would punish her.”
           </p>
           <p>
            The rituals reportedly occurred five to six times a week until R.H. turned 12. When she was 14 years old, the lawsuit alleges, she was required to witness and document other girls’ ritualistic abuse with church leaders.
           </p>
           <p>
            “The existence of this religious doctrine and rituals is verified in the evidence that was found in the FLDS Church’s Temple in Eldorado, Texas,” the lawsuit alleges. “Defendant Warren S. Jeffs has been convicted in Texas of engaging in such conduct in the FLDS Church’s Temple in Eldorado, Texas.
           </p>
           <p>
            This relates to Ritual Abuse.  We have had Victims on here telling of these same abuses especially that of

            .  Stcharles of course hers was Satanic in nature as well, We shall see what comes out with this case and whether it is the same type.  From what I have read, this certainly sounds similar and also of family cults as well.  I am so proud of this young woman and her Courage.  This flies in the face of the False Memory Syndrome Foundation.  This is proof it does exist.

             Warren Jeffs has been in prison for years. His horrendous crimes against women and children (and even young men) are legendary, but he's part of the break-off FLDS sect which has in recent years been brought to justice.

             , however, is about the mainstream LDS church headquartered in SLC. One reason I didn't mention (for the story being buried) is that Utah is a theocracy -- the LDS church controls everything from Utah politicians to law enforcement. That's changing as demographics change.  Most members are actually good people who are finally waking up.

              yes, I have had a few friends/acquaintances who were Mormons, and they all seemed pretty level-headed if not perhaps a little misguided... I have read some seedy stuff about the LDS (possibly being a front for straight Satanism), but if I'm being fair it seems almost every organized religion has claims of this nature at some level or another
             </p>
             <p>
              that being said, I do find the doctrines of the LDS very odd... I would not recommend anyone seeking answers look to the teachings of this church, but I do feel compassion for those who have been raised under its belief system

              I am hoping they are strung up and flogged in public.  If you notice, I included a link to an article that says they are expanding and building 12 more churches, globally.  That scares me.

                It's the religion they have chosen for all of us.  Find a house of worship that still preaches the teachings of old and keep praying hard.  I have never really been concerned before about houses of worship,  but yes, there are more popping up globally.  THEIR push for Islam is what scares me.  The one world religion.

                  I agree.  And there are many that are aware.  There are many that have not spoken up but they are aware.  There are some that are attending Church again, only not donating.  Also many that are praying now.  They have faith again since the Pa. grand jury and the possibility of change.

                  We could be at this 24 hrs. a day all of us and it still would not be enough.  There is so much to dig into.   I believe one of the highest donors was the former owner of Dominos PIzza.  Can't bring his name up right now.  Some say he is a good guy but a lot of people think Buffet is too.  LOL.   The largest request from the pope was $25M and they OKd it.  Another LOL.

              Yep, but they have been proven incorrect.  I remember posting it in comments of another post about FMSF.    I tried to write more, to continue with more info and it was really good but I kept getting  OOPS something happened and There was a mistake or something.  I copied it twice and to no avail.  Very Odd Indeed.   I have pinged 314 so hoping will join us.  He did the FMSF post.

            The mormon church is infested with pedos 10x worse than the catholic church. Not surprising since the first two leaders Joseph Smith and Brigham Young were serial sex abusers. It's rotten to the core from top to bottom and always was.

              the Strangites have a very different belief about Jesus.  Strangites believe that Jesus was completely mortal.  They believe that Joseph was the literal father of Jesus, not God.  Jesus became the Son of God through his commune with God, but Jesus was 100% mortal.

               There was a split of the Mormon community, and while some ventured west, others settled in Wisconsin near Burlington and Janesville.

               Voree (pronounced "Vor-ee") is an unincorporated community in the Town of Spring Prairie in Walworth County, Wisconsin, United States.[1][2][3] It is best known as the headquarters of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints (Strangite), a denomination of the Latter Day Saint (Mormon) movement. According to James Strang, founder of the Strangite church and of the town, the name means "Garden of Peace".[4] The community is situated along former Wisconsin Highway 11 just west of the Racine County line.
              </p>
              <p>
               Although the Voree area was inhabited by Native Americans prior to the arrival of the first Europeans, the most notable part of its history begins in 1844, after the death of Joseph Smith Jr., founder of the Latter Day Saint movement. James J. Strang, who had declared himself Smith's successor, established Voree, then within the Wisconsin Territory as a "gathering place" for those Latter Day Saints who chose to follow his leadership rather than that of Brigham Young or other claimnants. Strang's followers moved from Nauvoo, Illinois and other places to Voree.

              The Mormon Trail extends from Nauvoo, Illinois, which was the principal settlement of the Latter Day Saints To 1846, to Salt Lake City, Utah. From Council Bluffs, Iowa to Fort Bridger in Wyoming, the trail follows much the same route as the Oregon Trail and the California Trail; these trails are collectively known as the Emigrant Trail.
             </p>
             <p>
              The Mormon pioneer run began in 1846, when Young and his followers were driven from Nauvoo. After leaving, they aimed to establish a new home for the church in the Great Basin and crossed Iowa. Along their way, some were assigned to establish settlements and to plant and harvest crops for later emigrants. During the winter of 1846–47, the emigrants wintered in Iowa, other nearby states, and the unorganized territory that later became Nebraska, with the largest group residing in Winter Quarters, Nebraska. Young led the vanguard company to the Salt Lake Valley, which was then outside the boundaries of the United States and later became Utah.

              do you have a source that isn't straight mormon propoganda? Oh right you aren't supposed to read anything about your own church that isn't "church approved." That's not creepy at all...
             </p>
             <p>
              It is well documented that J. Smith was making advances and even threats of eternal damnation for their whole family to 12 year old and 14 year old girls if they did not comply to his secret marriage demands. I know mormons think that is ok/old enough but the rest of us do not. And no it wasn't "normal for the times" that is why he was tarred and feathered, nearly castrated, and then had nitric acid poured in his mouth.  If anyone actually cares to know about this check out year of polygamy podcast.

                several other women have come out since then. Every time it was covered up.

               <p>
                If you're raped and your mormon you go to church court where they determine to what extent you "contributed" to your being raped. Then you have to repent for what you did to get yourself raped. Once you sinned by being raped in mormon culture you are considered "chewed gum." I don't know why it doesn't make more news that girls in 2017 and 2018 are being kicked out of BYU for being raped because they "broke the honor code."  You either have to be blind or evil to not know that's plain wrong.

            This is disgusting.  The one person that committed suicide was probably forced to commit the abuse and then could not live with it.  These perverts don't care about their own children even, why would they care about what they do to others.  I hope to God this wakes up some of the LDS Crowd.

            A few of us on VOAT have researched this particular case at length over the years. It was buried during the "Satanic Panic" in '80's and '90's, and discredited by the sinister and fraudulent "False Memory Syndrome Foundation" movement. We're very anxious to see justice for the victim/survivors and therapists who were also nearly ruined by these events.

             The therapist in this case later lost her license because she went to a patients home with a baseball bat and started destroying things. False memories are real
