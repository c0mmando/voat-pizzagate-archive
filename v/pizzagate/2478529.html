            So the claim is NXIVM installs a keylogger on Edgar S. Bronfman's computer using a hacked jpeg file.
           </p>
           <p>
            How easy is that? How many hidden keyloggers do porno viewers and users of all sorts of shady and controversial sites have installed? Wouldn't a billionaire have some better security?
           </p>
           <p>
            (This part is a bit odd:
           </p>
           <p>
            'Keeffe claimed that Raniere was involved in the plan and taught a young woman who was a Mexican immigrant and NXIVM member "to be a hacker." '
           </p>
           <p>
            My impression is Raniere is a former programmer from many years ago. So are his hobbies keeping up with computer exploits and banging cult members?
           </p>
           <p>
            The young woman "then spent like a year reading all of Edgar Bronfman's emails, including emails with Hillary Clinton and involving world leaders with the World Jewish Congress, then reporting on the contents to Keith and to Clare," Keeffe said.'
           </p>
           <p>
            Why would this young Mexican cult member need to learn to be a hacker to read e-mails, once the keylogger has obtained the password?
           </p>
           <p>
            Maybe this Keefe not at all computer savvy just got the details wrong.)

             What a Bleeping Mess!  Another Rabbit Hole with a Bottomless Pit.   These discoveries are always so convoluted it takes a mess of people weeks around the clock to figure it out.  Yeah I agree this guy could have been a handler or involved with MK Ultra programming.  Yes you are def on to something there.

              I'm fascinated with this case and hope it leads to some sort of public revelation.
             </p>
             <p>
              It's a bit like an onion. In this case the mainstream story is about the branding, sex, and arrest. Old news. Local Albany news and longtime cult critics are exposing much more sinister things. People with an interest in the conspiratorial view of history are speculating about the Bronfman connection. I'd agree could quite well be some sort of nefarious mkultra programming type scheme.
             </p>
             <p>
              Of course it's not like an onion at all, There's not such an orderly progression of layers from false to true, etc. There's disinfo.
             </p>
             <p>
              By the way I'm surprised I haven't seen any support for Raniere on voat:
             </p>
             <ul>
              <li>
               Red pill/masculinists could admire his way with women and his 'notch count'.
              </li>
              <li>
               For 'antisemites' the Frank Report guy claims Raniere is a 'holocaust-denying' neo-Nazi at war with the Bronfman empire.

               Oh God.  I hope there is not any support for him here.  Although, I have read some rather strange slamming of women on here.  I say strange because in our cause to fight against the trafficking of children, you would think that hearts are in the right place for all humans.  Go figure.  Yes, I am hoping there will be some kind of unraveling with this case.  Possibly all the actors have not as of yet been exposed.  I think there were more involved and at a much Higher Level.

                There is a huge reaction to feminism on the internet, in the sometimes-called manosphere, hence the negativity. Also, pizzagate voaters tend to be more compassionate, I think. Others enjoy being as offensive as possible; part of the reaction to PC and the celebration of free speech as opposed to modern society group think. I like the free flow of ideas to examine.
               </p>
               <p>
                (Big digression: In a nutshell, in the days of the 'patriarchy' the norm was for men &amp; women to form families. In a more feral state, it's claimed 80% of women mate with 20% of the males, kind of like wolves or lions. I do feel sorry for young men today, it seems many have no hope of a girlfriend.
               </p>
               <p>
                So then there are traditionalists, who bemoan the end of the traditional family, PUAs or pick up artists, who cynically use these theories to exploit female biological imperatives, and MGTOWs or men who go their own way, don't value female relationships. The latter two explain some of this 'strange slamming of women'.)

                 This is so sad if true.  I gather that this is their end game to stop the growth of the human race.  They want to kill off the next generation.  They were doing it with the flue vaccine and with the HIV vaccine in Africa being only 50% effective.  Getting men and women disenchanted with each other and making women more self sufficient and not needing anyone to complete their lives and making men more feminine by finding their feminine side ( a brainwashing of sorts) is for sure part of the plan.  If I see another man bun I am going to scream.  Also clothes that make men and women look alike and families as well.  You can't tell one from the other.  A friend of mine thinks I am nuts when I tell her about how I think the zippers were part of the plan when they stopped making women's pants with zippers on the side at the hip or in the back of the pants.  I said why must we have zippers in the front?  We don't need them there.  Another part of the plan. When will people see it?  It is becoming more obvious to me every day.

                  Thanks for the reply. Good observation about the zippers, these side and back zippers tend to be daintier also.

                   I am sick and tired of men looking like women and women looking like men.  Some things are generic but when something makes more sense and it still changes, I find it maddening.  What woman wants a bulge right on her stomach?  There is extra material and a zipper under it.  The other side and back zippers were much sleeker.  Very sneaky indeed.

              This article talks about some golden child named Gaelen, who was being groomed to be Raniere's heir, whose origin is a mystery, and who was being taken care of by "by five nannies who each speak to him in a different language—including Russian, Spanish, Hindi, and Chinese."

               omg.  What a nutcase idea.  Being groomed in many ways?  Perhaps MK U.  How in the world can a child turn out normal in anyway if spoken to in 5 different languages?  All sounds like some kind of covert and planned operation.  Evidently by Ranier.
