            I would love to meet you and your wife someday and we could share all of our freaky theories.  Yeah, my son was in diapers then too!  I put nothing past them, when you think that DC was planned around Pentagram.

            I know that 666 is an important set of numbers with Satanists.  #237 This is all I found that made any sense in an analysis of the movie "The Shining".  "Another theorist believed that Kubrick had directed the footage disseminated by NASA to publicize the Apollo 11 moon landing. He believed that there are telltale signs of the use of front projection in NASA's footage and that Kubrick was contracted to produce hoaxed footage of a fake moon landing. He points to the knitted Apollo 11 sweater that Danny wears and claims that "237" refers to the mean distance of the earth to the moon (see Lunar distance (astronomy)). He also refers to the fact that a carpet pattern resembles the Apollo launching pad as evidence that the film is an elaborate apology of sorts for Kubrick's involvement. In particular, the analyst feels that the tirade Jack delivers to Wendy about how she does not understand the duty of work and honoring a contract with an employer portrays Kubrick's own sense of isolation from keeping so big a secret." ****So, I think he was pointing to the False Flag Apollo that the CIA created.  Kubrick probably uses that # as a reminder when he also uses it in other films. The milemarker being #237 may have some connection with Apollo and the Airfield.  Who knows.  They have such crazy connections to try and constantly confuse us.  EDIT:  Could the Airfield have been where they did the Apollo False Flag? What do you think?

            Was just checking on my friends, when I saw this comment.  State of Monsanto?  Yes!  In 1972 Gena Scott unmasked the Veiled Prophet of that year at the Ball.  Tom K. Smith the VP of Monsanto!   The Veiled Prophet is a Secret Society and our friend had asked me to find what society is presented in Eyes Wide Shut.  This is the one I believe was chosen by Kubrick.  This is another reason why St. Louis is so very important in our eradication of the Global Ring.

            , I really would rather not take this post down, because I think we need to be teaching people how to spot the spooks whenever we can. Unfortunately, you didn't bother to folllow the submission guidelines providing supporting links. In fact, you didn't even link to the video in question so people can get to it. I am assuming this was a mistake, perhaps because you are on mobile and Voat is a bitch on mobile.
           </p>
           <p>
            I am going to leave this up for now in hopes you will edit your post to include links. You might want to highlight the words "child sex trafficking" click the link button (#3), and paste the url in the box. This will make the connection to pizzagate stand out, and make it less likely the morning mod doesn't just nuke it out of hand for Rule 1 and 4. When we have a lot of posts to remove, or are tired, mods who open a post that obviously has provided no supporting links (which stand out, because they are in blue), will just remove for Rule 4 without even reading any further. Just a reality.

             Never mind. I see other ppl asking as well.

             Thought George may have blocked me because I had a lengthy discussion under his yesterdays vid about him being alphabet. I was asked by another person to delete my comments about that (I didnt)...I believe he is alphabet, as well. Cant, for the life of me, understand why that assertion upsets so many ppl. Not all alphabet are bad guys. Thats why there is war going on within the agencies. That said, I'm not gonna blindly follow anyone w/o question just because they tell me to do so. He has some very dedicated devotees who never question anything he says and seem to get upset when others do...that in itself is a red flag.

              Well, something's going on because, if not, he would have been suicided long ago and his YT channel shut down.  He also comes out and says things, "Well, I'm off to Chicago this afternoon for xyz reason." No one dealing with the type of info he's putting out there would do that.  So, I'm very cautious. Also, Pulse was a hoax. If he didn't mention that, well...

            wow.. I've been following Webb closely for many months, but I didn't realize who Mateen was in episode 143. I can't believe this is the "shooter's father".

            Not to derail here, but it's worth saying that the Pulse night club shooting was a ridiculous hoax. I've commented on this at length before including
            <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/v/news/1687111/8265545">
             here

            .
           </p>
           <p>
            It was a goofy sham. I'm not saying Mateen's family isn't connected to the Clintons or whatever but Omar Mateen didn't shoot up a night club.

              It would be more convincing if there weren't someone like you in literally every thread talking about how their cousin's dermatologist's step-son-in-law has an old friend whose daughter died at Sandy Hook.

               I mean I don't exactly know how else to convince you without giving away personal details which would put myself and my friends in danger. (Most people already think I'm a shill and would love to fuck with me and my loved ones given the chance)

              Watch all the Pulse hoax vids you can find on YT. The puzzle pieces will all fall together.   Why? Among many others... Fear mongering and another excuse to try to limit guns in the country.  If you have the stomach for learning more BS, when you're done with this one, repeat with Sandy Hook hoax.

               Yeah I'm going to look up SandyHook. I keep hearing about it. I started a documentary that was over an hour a fell asleep. Not because I was bored. So I'm going to watch it again. I also found a good website on it.

                  Most welcome.  I have found her to be one of the very best commentators on the subject.
At first with Sandy Hoax I thought it was a false flag/children were killed but it was all planned.
This is a good lesson in controlled opposition or limited hangout.  The theory was circulated that SH has a large satanic community (which is very possible) and that the children were part of a sacrifice.  That one may still be floating around/I don't know.  On another forum in the very early days someone opened my eyes to no one was even killed/that was before all the evidence that the school wasn't even operational.  It is hard for me to imagine anyone who looks at all the facts gathered since the early days would still believe in Sandy Hoax...or the Pulse shooting either.
I'm not sure about the ignorance is bliss thing...I think it's just ignorance is ignorance

                   I have started diving into SandyHook. I'm going to check out who you told me about, but yesterday I watched 1/2 of an over 2 hour documentary on it. I'm going to finish it today. It's amazing that the citizen journalists are the ones uncovering this and did an amazing job! This was from a few years ago. I can't imagine how many updates since! I'm going to start looking up things from Sofia Smallstorm.

                    Good for you!!!  Sandy hoax was so badly scripted I was more than astounded.  Grandpa Gene is a hoot and a half.  Did you know Anderson Cooper is CIA?  Look up his history and his mama/very very creepy.  He was one of the big cheeses reporting on Sandy hoax.  Sandy Hook was basically a dead end town until lots of land purchases the year before and the parent peeps were then given them for a dollar.  The rabbit hole goes so deep.  Originally it looks like Adam's bro was the target perp but thankfully he was on social media and avoided the ruse.  Adam might never have even existed.  The so called coroner is also a fascinating study in creating a character.  That he laughed when being interviewed is so over the top creepy even if ppl actually believed there were dead children.
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    Happy happy rabbit hole exploring...at first it's disconcerting but after awhile it becomes liberating.  You start to see the common threads of all the false flags.  As I understand it, someone correct me if in error, a psy-op is manufactured but ppl actually die (or get hurt).  A hoax means no one was doa (or injured).  They are all false flags.
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    One thing I have learned with false flags is controlled opposition will spin multiple stories via alternative media...to keep ppl chasing their tails with tales.  Discernment comes with practice.

                     I've heard for years that Anderson Cooper is CIA! I never found out for sure tho. Yeah that old grandpa guy is weird and they said he was like a psychologist or something! I haven't gotten to the coroner yet. So far, I can see why so many people believe it was a hoax

                      His mother is Gloria Vanderbilt.  Some very creepy pictures of childhood, the symbols behind her bed where she read the boys bedtime stories.  His brother committed suicide (or facsimile of such) by jumping off the balcony while mommie dearest was present.

                      Grandpa Gene told so many different versions of the story it was hard to keep up lol.  But that's how these psy-ops work/they keep changing the stories till they find a common narrative that sells well.  They also keep recycling the crisis actors.  One woman at sandy hoax was also at the Boston bombing/now what are the chances of that?  Just one of many examples of re-purposing crisis actors.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                      The star of the Boston psy-op was Carlos Arredondo/the cowboy guy.  He too has an interesting history for inquiring minds.  The script for his dramatic rescue was so poorly researched (like the guy in the wheel chair would have died way before the dramatic shots) but hey, ppl love a good hero story/with a cowboy hat even more so.  Look up Carlos and all the fake stuff around his themed story.

              Watch youtube videos about Orlando hoax, etc. Many videos. Pure Hoax for Gun Control. Basically, in one fell swoop they got a majority of the LGBT crowd against guns... Cultural Hegemony, Crowd Politics, etc.

             100% this. And I am going to assume that ex CIA George Webb didn't mention this fact? This was stated in the first FBIAnon 4 chan. "Orlando was a hoax"

             I was online at the time it went down. There were NO pictures or tweets from the club, only MSM reports. Later, judge napolitano came out and said that the FBI report states there were no deaths until after swat showed up. His statement is on YouTube.

              It was one of the most blatant and ridiculous displays of inept crisis acting and screwball staging of the past several years. Nothing added up about it even at the time,  you had all these ludicrous circumstances and bizarre characters involved. No ambulances or anything at the scene... videos of civilians carrying their "injured" buddies towards, not away from, the club, etc.  It's amazing how the "deadliest shooting of U.S. history" is really one of the most transparent and sloppy contrived events of all time and even more amazing that so many people can take something like

                Exactly, you can't keep having so many bizarre, inexplicable absurdities about the case along with no real evidence it happened at all and not think, hm maybe this was just a hoax.

               Still not a shill but keep trying! Yes, I do defend controversial things... that's why I'm interested in pizzagate in the first place, but I'm not going to stand by while you people refuse to discuss anything other than what the hive-mind believes -- everyone's a super horrible pedophile gay jew!!!!

               There are sketchy things and then there's pedophilia. Two different things. Like I said, if we had real proof of Ashton FUCKING UNDERAGED MILA then come at me and I'll change my opinion.

                So everything is right for you unless and until something is, without question, through undeniable first-hand documented evidence, shown to be wrong. Then, would you need to be convinced that the act declared wrong is objectively wrong? I'm sure you would question that as well.

                 Why do you keep coming back to my posts?
                </p>
                <p>
                 I'm saying it's unfair to blast Ashton Kutcher for his producers' decisions. I'm saying there's little to no evidence Ashton is a pedophile based off of this casting decision.
                </p>
                <p>
                 People make questionable moral decisions that they regret later. This might be one of them for Ashton and the whole production crew. This does NOT mean they are pedophiles. I believe in the search for truth it's unfair to automatically jump to conclusions, especially when it has to do with such dire accusations.

                 is to make people think about these drastic jumps. I know people don't like me because I try to challenge beliefs, and sometimes I do it in quite rude ways because I'm so baffled at the jumps. I truly believe in pizzagate and am with you, but I refuse to let this get derailed by accusations based off of nonsense. This is an important cause.

            Totally agree.  These false flags are paraded around like they actually happened.  Honestly, if an inquiring mind were to look at the footage it would be obvious it was staged.  Crisis actors were their usual piss poor performers too.  One of my fav tubes is carrying 'victims' in the direction of the club (opps) and when they thought the cameras were off let the 'victim' down who proceeded to walk just fine.  Only a small sampling of the fake footage.  Search Orlando nightclub hoax etc for plenty of video evidence.
           </p>

            I haven't seen Geo's latest yet.  If he is promoting the club as a real event (?) then he is either brain dead or a terrible journalist.  I still say limited hangout.

              All of this is wikileaks compromised/who can say?
But today under comments someone asked Geo and he said yes, compromised.
So I'm inclined to think wikileaks is legit lol.

              Not too long ago he also said Robert Steele was legit which left me laughing.

               Yep, those CIA guys have to stick together. Geo is tricky though, he is a smart one and throws in a LOT of truth. But also massive bullshit, like his campaign to tweet a certain hashtag and we will all get a million dollars.

                Couple of my favs..
                <strong>
                 .all false flag shootings
                </strong>
                are dyncorp wanting to take out one of their operatives/course he doesn't call them false flags.  The ff Dallas cop shooting was bc one cop had worked for dyncorp and had a fakebook page.  This was based on  In 2007, Feinberg told Cerberus shareholders, "If anyone at Cerberus has his picture in the paper and a picture of his apartment, we will do more than fire that person. We will kill him. The jail sentence will be worth it."  Of course he was joking, he is a very quiet/shy man, takes his privacy seriously.  But now, hey, all FF are bc someone worked for dyncorp.
               </p>
               <p>
                Um, okay.
               </p>
               <p>
                Or the other funny...Feinberg has a brownstone bc his place has security cameras and is in walking distance of CFR.  This of course after one devotee had to point out 3 times that Feinberg's townhouse was not in Egypt (it's the former Egypt embassy in NYC)/which blew his story that the Muslim Brotherhood met weekly at Feinberg's home in Egypt.  So we are to believe that this billionaire has his private residence set up as a brownstone/has no problem having child prostitutes and pimps running around in his private space all hours of the day and night.  Don't rich peeps hire their dirty work out anymore?  Sad.
               </p>
               <p>
                At first I thought he was just stupid but well intentioned (benefit of the doubt) but too many instances keep cropping up.  And yeah, he does throw in a Lot of truth so his limited is of value.  I watch to see who are the candidates for throwing under the bus.
               </p>
               <p>
                Didn't you love the one where he was going to Haiti and had everyone praying for him?
               </p>
               <p>
                I think my all time fav was his true confessional of undercover (pun intended) of doing a dominatrix thing at a supposed brownstone/that he found on craigslist no less, in three different cities.  That had me rolling in the isles.
               </p>
               <p>
                I participated in a comment discussion about the significance of satanic ritual in the pedo thing/it was really very thoughtful, intelligent...lots of back and forth.  Geo deleted the tube/said he got too many weird comments.  The pedo thing has too much traction to keep in the bag so that's being let out but the satanic part is being discouraged at every turn.  I really love limited hangouts for what they do expose intention wise.
               </p>
               <p>
                Don't know if you saw my post yesterday but in comments 143 part 3 if memory serves a devotee asked Geo if Julian/wiki was compromised.  He said seems like it.  Well, that settled it for me bc there is so much Julian/wiki is/isn't and how the hell would I know lol.  I'm now going great Julian/wiki is not compromised lol.  And Geo said Robert Steele was the real deal while back which I never questioned/that guy is so obvious it's laughable.

                  I know what you mean on the 9/11 comment which was in 2010.  It's one that has me perplexed too.  I like to look at issues from multiple sides.  Take 9/11...there are some what I consider really wacko theories out there like no one died, it was all CGI, then the arguments it was  Mossad, Saudi's and others I'm sure forgetting.  Thing is Mossad and the Saudi's are two peas in a pod. That's the thing with controlled opposition/toss as many stories out there to keep us chasing our tails with tales.

                  Honestly I haven't kept up with 9/11 theories, like what were the prevailing ones when Julian made the comment and have the theories matured since then?  I never delved too deeply into it bc it was clear to me what happened and the facts I accessed gave the what and hows.  I'm not going to be one of those friend of friend ya da/but I have a friend in NYC who was there and saw it/planes deff hit the towers.  Have another friend whose hub was a fireman and he died of cancer from his exposure.  The towers were underwater/a financial drain/so bringing them down to facilitate mass surveillance and war is a no brainer.  Were there ppl on the planes, can't say.  But did some smucks with minimal flight training preform such precision/no way in hell.  The whole thing was such a poor production.  My best guess is US, Saudi, Israel all had their hands in the pie bc it served the interest of them all.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  So was Julian saying he agrees with the 'party line' or referring to the plethora of way out there spiracy theories floating around?  I really can't say.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  It does seem odd for someone who has not only access to troves of info but raised for awhile in a cia cult till his mom left would actually accept the 'party line' when there are so many in your face blunders.  Another interesting thing about Julian is his complexion which as i read, the children from that cult were all very similar.  Supposedly that is where he got his distrust of all govts.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  And he could be compromised now/or cia all along...how would I know.
Then again he could be the real deal.
Same with Snowden.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  Some say wiki is now a honeypot.
Some say it was always a honeypot.
Who would benefit from wiki being discredited?
These are questions I ask/and wait as more information surfaces.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  I just found it amusing that Geo says Julian is compromised (now) and Robert Steele is the real deal.
With all the distraction and disinfo Geo inserts (you too can be a millionaire) it's more like watching a psychological who done it or a game of Clue.  Wiki is supposed to come out with a lot more info.  If that actually happens more pieces of the puzzle to see what fits.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  In all of this I never lose sight of the expanded perspective.  Mass (un)consciousness is exploring thought forms.  These thought forms produce a virtual reality.  Even science is starting to admit that this is probably a hologram and thoughts produce the reality.  Trump is simply representative of an archetype as Hill is of another.  If this civilization is not going to barrel into a reset like Atlantis then it has to see where 'free will' has devolved and make an about face.  So all the characters in the matrix represent ideas being explored.  I truly hope a shift in consciousness will happen/and there are some encouraging signs it will/but if it doesn't it will have a reset (bc the ppl will not be allowed to blow the planet up), Atlantis was not the first, history does repeat if ppl don't learn from the past.

                   Since we're on the subject, though it pains me to say, and i've no idea why Geo is saying whatever the fuck he's saying (which changes from day to day), it does appear that Wikileaks and Assange were never legit. first off, TIME mag introduced WL to the world as the great whistleblowers site before they even leaked anything. TIME is a tool of the State. If WL was truly anti-govt, why would they get free publicity, and for doing nothing? The first guy WL asked to do what Assange finally agreed to (run the place) said no, as he saw what they were really about.

                    You bring up interesting points~thank you.  Honestly I've not followed wiki or thought much about it till the podesta emails.  I was aware of the Manning incident and relation to wiki but that was about it.  I've grown so distrustful of limited hangouts over the years everything comes with a grain of salt.  Tarpley at one time I thought was legit maybe but caught a few things that made me go um.  I cked into Young thinking he might be legit and caught a few things there.  It was like did I find tragic flaws in the above or shills planting tragic flaws/who can say.  It's the reason I don't take anything anyone says to the bank.  Way way back I thought AJ might be legit (like super way back lol) but he had this w2k scare night that I read about later (never put any stock into w2k so didn't keep up with it) which was reminiscent of Wells War of the Worlds/testing public reaction.

                    In it all I have always wondered how these ex spooks or bastions of truth manage to stay this side of the dirt.  I'm from the 60's and have watched more assassinations than I care to count.  JFK was my first.  Back then in Texas (where I was from) the grapevine traveled beauty shops.  Mom would come home with stories of witness to the assassination that had mysteriously died or disappeared.  Anyone in Tx with half a brain knew what LBJ was all about.

                    Back when I was in college Pacifica radio was to the best of my knowledge a source of independent media.  One night starting after midnight was an ex CIA who went on for hours describing how IC works, how they take ppl out etc/fascinating.  He explained how LBJ was off'ed.  It not only made perfect sense it coincided with my impression of LBJ announcing he would not run for re-election and he looked scared.

                    When I was in college I dated a fello whose grandfather was one of the founders of Gulf Oil.  I dated him the year before he turned 21.  He was doing the as he called it 'peasant' thing, drove a VW bug, simple apt etc.  He told me that the ppl that run things you will never hear their names.  I can still see him saying with disdain Hughes, Rockefeller, Rothschild etc pawns.  The ones at the top you will never hear their names and they play the world like a giant monopoly game.  When he turned 21 he went to England for the summer/a rite of passage thing.  When he came back he was so totally transformed I didn't recognize him.  He became very interested in controlling every aspect of my life and gave me the Story of O (s and m) to read for my education.  Needless to say I got out of that relationship asap.  Few years ago I read the children of the elite are given free reign till they are 21/sow wild oats kinda thing.  It all fit.

                    The hippie movement died almost overnight with the murder of Hendrix and Joplin.  It wasn't until few years ago when I stumbled on Laurel Canyon series McGowen that filled in the missing pieces.  Took 10 years to relocate to the woods and disengage with general society for the most part.  Now I watch.  There are more of us than might be imagined that see it's all a ruse.  As a sidenote, Dave was diagnosed with a very aggressive form of cancer (with no prior symptoms) and doa'ed pretty quick...inquiring minds.

                    One of the only ones that I 'feel' was legit/and again, how would I know...is Bill Cooper.  He was assassinated in a very public fashion sending a message.  My first exposure to Bill was a VHS tape that circulated in the early 80's where he was in Sedona, sweating like crazy obviously scared shitless, exposing at the time what he thought was top secret info he had stumbled on by mistake.  Years later after the internet I watched as he explained the top secret info he thought he had stumbled on was actually put there for him to stumble so he would spread dis-info.

                    It has not escaped me that Julian possibly has been honeypot all along bc of some simple things like he gets take out from a fav place near the embassy and poisoning the food would be a no brainer.  I mean basically, if 'they' want you dead might as well invest in prepayment funeral thing.

                    If it has all been limited hangout then why would Geo indicate wiki is compromised now?  Perhaps to give legitimacy to the Podesta leaks.  And if that is the case then what I read web whoring that CI wanted Clinton out bc she had become a liability (health and otherwise) would make sense.  It's not like these satanic worshiping creeps don't say all the things they do and off all the ppl they do with a piss poor record of covering their asses.  Let's face it, they are not terribly bright.  Well ha, that would be obvious if they actually believe that worshiping Lucifer gives them special powers.  As a group they are sloppy, arrogant and have some delusion they are untouchable.  Going back to my college bf they are all expendable with no second thought.

                    Where does that leave us with trump?  Again, my impressions are subjective so I take them with my own grains of salt.  It 'seems like' he was sincere, patriot, narcissist and megalomaniac (obvious)/mafia and money laundering/but not into fucking or eating babies...not really psychopathic like I see in Clinton, Bush and bama.  Bama may just be garden variety sociopath, I'm not sure (and really don't care).  Trump was going to get the US out of all these middle east wars, work with Russia on ISIS and help the 'forgotten man'.  His budget skinny is cutting programs to the poor and increasing military spending, increasing presence in the ME and having DHS hire 10 thousand new peeps.  Not that the dems ever gave a flying f**k about the poor peeps either/all their pet programs were just for show (and votes) and to keep the poor placated with substandard support services/just enough to keep someone barely alive/slave management.
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    Israel and Saudi Arabia bromance wants Syria and Iran decimated just like Libya.  If trump really wants to limit fed spending then stop rewarding CPS for stealing children and giving them to abusers and pedos.  Trumps demeanor with the Saudi prince is also very telling (imho), an air of major discomfort.  Trump's fav child has his ear with her slum lord hubby so anything he does right now is clouded.  Will he wake up to the scam/who can say.  If he is actually what you see is what you get then he's on a fast track learning curve.  He is famous for never forgetting when he has been double crossed.  I would 'imagine' there is a huge cluster fuck going on in the admin as we speak regardless of the pom pom squad at the ever popular donald reddit thinking everything he does is emperor material.  Even within that, how many trolls and shills are promoting the god emperor scenario?  I was banned bc I contacted the mods about a growing trend for bigotry/I'm a concerned troll lol.  Shoot, I didn't even know the term concerned troll till the campaign stuff which I didn't even follow till maybe Sept.

                    My major point of focus is a lot of meditation and some esoteric leanings I follow.  Word on the 'street' is we are at a tipping point and it could go either way.  It is fear that keeps the present matrix dominant.  The more any one of us do to disengage from the fear diminishes the matrix.  I do see lots of ppl waking up and I see some reasoned comments on the donald reddit that indicates some are asking hard questions other than leading the pom pom squad.  Looking globally ppl in so many countries have reached being fed up in critical mass proportions.  The song freedom's just another word for nothing left to lose.  With the establishment of the EU easy to see where it was heading and now the masses really have nothing left to lose.  In that I see 'hope'.
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    I never saw trump as the solution/he's the wake up call.  Unless of course he's been playing along from the get go/again/how would I know.  But if one studies history there have been wake up calls 'before' with varying success.  Kinda like in the spiral of time study were history keeps repeating and each time testing to see what was learned from the 'past'.
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    My 'belief' is emotions are magnetic and these magnetic charges form thoughts.  Neuro science explains this quite well.  I also 'believe' that love has a stronger magnetic charge than fear.  Meditation connects me to the highest vibrations.  If I look at the slogans circulating (reflects ideas mass (un) consciousness explores) the 'love trumps fear' takes on a different meaning completely disassociated with the campaign rhetoric.  The same with the key words make strong, safe, great...all ideas mass (un) consciousness is exploring.  There is so much good information on neuro science/quantum explorations that can bring in another element for perspective.  I'm not talking about the airy fairy new age stuff that is just as much a part of controlled opposition.
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    Re pizza or pedogate...the importance is that this mindset has been going on for centuries.  Other night I was looking at the history of castles and mansions built by the 'elite'.  Consider the irony, all these places built with such over the top opulence, secret pathways et all and for the most part these places where the wealthy cohabited were engaged in satanic rituals as a matter of course.  If all the trump movement does is red pill ppl about that it's huge bc as I see it, it's the seat of fear.  Unraveling the matrix one thread at a time.

                     Thank you so much for your input! We have so much in common. Meditation, beliefs, from the 60's.

                     I think one mistake we can make is to believe there is some easy way to see all of this. Fro instance, "If Geo says it, it must be wrong", "If Assange says it, he's a hero it is certainly true, and the whole story for sure."
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     At the end of the day, you're right to hint that our focus should be love, and that whatever game they're playing, if it's not based in this high vibration, they won't be successful.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     I also think we are at a tipping point, but due to a near death experience and what i was told/shown, it's definitely God who wins this one.

                      Roger on that one lol.  I tried for years to sort it all out/is it real or is it memorex?  Came to the conclusion there are no easy answers so have fun exploring from all perspectives.  As a child my fav game was Clue.  The is Julian alive or CGI still continues with fervor.  I'm like shit, we'll know when we know and not a minute beforehand.

                      On the Geo wiki is now compromised/implying wasn't 'before'.  After my comment thought you know, it's just to keep everyone confused was wiki, is wiki.  So much focus on wiki, watch the right hand and don't look at the man behind the curtain.

                      Jim Stone is another popular one that has his own following/i'm not one of the groupies just interested in how the hangout functions.  Did read somewhere that some ppl say they think he was taken out a long time ago bc his writing style completely changed.  Apparently he was always spelling/grammar ocd and then the shift.  That would perhaps make sense/that he was at one time 'real' and now it's memorex.  I never could buy that he's doing some hide and seek in Mexico while 'they' try to take him out.  Oh please/that story is so lame.  They have no problem off'ing judges, politicians et all...and they can't get little ol'jim?  I was thinking about starting a real estate company selling ocean front in AZ/it should go well

              Absolutely.  When it gets to blatant and comments under the tube reflect such he tones it down/monitoring public response to d and d.  Still there is value to limited hangouts if you know how to sift thru the info.

               I've noticed that too, he is very serious about his operation. I've never seen anyone else as concerned about weighing the public response and tailoring his message according to that. It's why I'm 100% sure he's working for "them" still. Plus his whole claim to fame to fame that he was super concerned with finding Eric braverman. How compassionate! Turns out he didn't care at all. Heard he got a job in California and just dropped the entire story. What a joke.

            Really alphabet soup. You must be an expert. Since he has outed every alphabet soup and himself in some ways so far I would say he is all. There comes a time for choosing. He has exposed CIA,  FBI,  all the way back to WW11. Both Republicans and Democrats...all so called religions. Most countries. Kings, Princes, Prime Ministers, Presidents, maybe you should follow along more carefully.

            There was also a picture floating around of Mateen in the halls of Congress. The word was that he either was or wanted to run for President of Afghanistan.  You can't make this story up.  Yes and DWS was also involved in this Spy Trap.  This is how they arranged the wire tapping of Trump as well.  The bribery of McCabe was done by Terry McAuliff when he donated a large sum of money to McCabe's wife while she was running for office.  It was over $600K.  Edit: Hope this stays up.

            Oooooh, I remember this dude. He seems too connected to not be shady, aside from the fact that a lot of things don't add up about that shooting.

              OOH!  Thanks for those pictures.  The one holding his coat in the State Dept. is the one I saw.  I believe (this is only my opinion) that he may be involved in the Poppy Trade of Afghanistan.  Who knows. But this whole thing reeks to High Heaven.
