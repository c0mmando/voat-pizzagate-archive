<p>If it were not for these 2 men, there would be no pizzagate, therefore, this post is pizzagate relevant, in particular to the release of the Wikileaks/Podesta emails.</p>
<p>We have had NO direct proof that Assange is alive since October 2016 around the time his internet was cut off.  The time between October 15-18, the internet was on fire with rumors thast he had been taken from the Embassy or had been assasinated at the Embassy.  These rumors swirled around for a little while, then all became quiet.</p>
<p>It would be a BIG mistake to consider the Pilger and Hannity interviews with Assange to be real.</p>
<p>Consider the John Pilger interview of 11/25/16.  It is obvious that the video was edited.  No date is mentioned in the interview itself.  Pilger later responded that the interview took place on 10/30/16.  No scenes included both Assange and Pilger together.  The only thing we do know is that it took place during the presidential election.
<a href="https://youtu.be/zEMKrRXjA3U">https://youtu.be/zEMKrRXjA3U</a></p>
<p>Then we have the Sean Hannity interview on 01/02/17 that took place on 12/26/16.  Hannity, the guy who initially called for Assange\'s arrest, now believing every word Assange says.  Check-out the suspicious fake-green studio illusion, and you will see evidence of disproportion during the video.  It also appears that the 2 of them were not in the same room.  Was Hannity at the London Ecuador Embassy?  Probably. Was that Julian Assange?  No, not in real-time.  Was he a clone or body double?  High possibility.
<a href="https://youtu.be/F6bTUrQgYDM">https://youtu.be/F6bTUrQgYDM</a></p>
<p>About a week after the Hannity interview, on 01/10/17, Assange refused to give digital proof of life.  He was asked repeatedly to provide the Key during his &quot;Ask Me Anything&quot; session on Twitch via his Reddit account.  He did not provide it but gave the impression that Wikileaks was compromised.  It is more likely both compromised and controlled.

<p>For all intents and purposes, we must keep Julian Assange alive in our hearts and must remember him as a true hero.  Perhaps January 10 should be set aside as his special day, this upcoming year and every year that follows.</p>',
