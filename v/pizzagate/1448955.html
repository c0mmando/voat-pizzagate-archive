            Hey, you may have seen this already, but in case not: You could use a wikipedia page? But Wiki is funded by soros.  A Trump Supporter made us a brand new Wikipedia to replace the biased censored Wikipedia. It is located here. But I confess I do not know how to use it. Just saw it. It is called infogalactic

            Probably not a good idea to say in the thread that you've got nothing to do with the site and then essentially admit to it, two posts later.  Not trying to sound like a dick, just don't know how else to word it - looking out for your safety brother.
           </p>
           <p>
            PS: I'll be setting up an anonymous voat-user-only (I'll post a thread with details for how to get access) site in about 2 hours from now when I get back from the doctor/pharmacist.  I will post more details but it's basically a combo CMS type deal I originally developed for another site in my non-investigative life (lol) as a pro web dev...it's got combinations of the immediacy of twitter (albeit with the functionality of a facebook feed as far as content and display goes)/the social+information hunting aspect of twitter/reddit, the file management of an online cloud drive like google drive and a collaborative documentation system/shared file system - based off of stuff like Microsoft OneNote and the methods used in a github repository.  Versioning, tracking, edit/deletion reports, commentary,, wiki-like functionality so people can edit the pages in necessary places.  We can view/host videos with this youtube clone plugin, the commenting system is whole-site so it'll auto-tag in the 'social' feed part, except for the commentary on github/file revisions etc.  I've actually got this really cool new software suite that's a collaborative video creation platform for community-based live-streaming and media creation (in the cloud, and I just got a new upgraded server I'm looking to try out) with the insane (to me) capability to have up to 4 people live video-streaming, with an interactive live chat/'shared monitor' feature (to display shared media amongst those in the room - can be controlled by the chat moderators/users or the people streaming) and each of the four people has option to structure/live edit to an extent, their feed output.  Display their desktop or program a mini-playlist to run off of the files in their drive-share folder, or any other stuff in the 'collective archive'.
           </p>
           <p>
            I hope to have a solid, secure, and reliably uncensored and
            <em>
             proven
            </em>
            resource for any media clips whatsoever relating to pizzagate.  Like any kind of documentaries on the subject of satanic rituals, child trafficking rings, news clips on the subject - anything people want - to include in posts here on this voat page, or to download on their own setup.  This way we can have a board to live-collaborate with each other in real time, and at the same time - also be creating a useful archival record that not only has the entirety of the scope of the investigation (essentially running back a play-by-play showing how the investigatory process went down and how one lead went to another) which will be super informative for those watching it on YouTube or wherever - and also help massively in the updating and development of this "mind map" styled investigation "web" I've created to help explain the scope of this and the interconnectedness of this massive conspiracy.
           </p>
           <p>
            Anyway, will update when done.  Much love to y'all keep fighting the badness.

            This is absolutely great idea for two reasons. 1 - there exists too much cluttered information, Wiki can organize it and help convincing others. 2 - Wiki is great backup platform if Voat is compromised. Furthermore, it is easy to backup Wiki once the information is put in place.

            this has come up a few times. It would definitely make investigating easier, but the question is who can we trust to host our information? And is it risky trusting a centralised source of information? These are things I would think about.
