<p>Larry Schweikart is an American conservative historian and a retired professor of history at the University of Dayton.  He is the author of more than a dozen books - his best known popular book is &quot;A Patriot\'s History of the United States.&quot;  He has been on almost all media at one time or another.  A passage from one of his books, &quot;Lessons My Father Taught Me,&quot; sums up his beliefs nicely and succinctly:</p>
<p>&quot;Be scrupulously honest in everything you do and say.  In your family life, business life, in your conversations with friends and neighbors, always tell the truth.  Always own up to your mistakes.  Prove you can be trusted to always tell the truth.  Your reputation is at stake.  Let people know you stand for the truth.&quot;</p>
<p>Yesterday, 01/26/2017, some very interesting opinions and information appeared in a thread by Mr. Schweikart on twitter, and here they are:</p>
<p>&quot;The last thing I wanted to do this morning was a thread, but alas, the situation requires it.  Sharyl Attkisson is one of THE best reporters out there, but apparently she never reads twitter.  Many of us have said this for some time...&quot;  
</p>
<p>He then provides a link to Attkisson\'s article from The Hill, &quot;As walls close in on FBI, the bureau lashes out at its antagonists.&quot;</p>
<p><a href="http://thehill.com/opinion/white-house/370717-as-walls-close-in-on-fbi-the-bureau-lashes-out-at-its-antagonists?amp&amp;__twitter_impression=true">http://thehill.com/opinion/white-house/370717-as-walls-close-in-on-fbi-the-bureau-lashes-out-at-its-antagonists?amp&amp;__twitter_impression=true</a></p>
<p>Schweikart continues with quite a bit more:</p>
<p>&quot;...that DOJ knows exactly what is in this documentation because SESSIONS. HAS. BEEN. INVESTIGATING. THIS. STUFF. FOR. A. YEAR.</p>
<p>The biggest new revelation she offers is that potentially ALL of the FBI\'s work for years may now be undone, at risk, and under scrutiny.</p>
<p>That of course would be U1, Benghazi (<a href="https://voat.co/user/CharlieDaniels">@CharlieDaniels</a>), Fast and Furious, Lynchmob\'s meeting with the Slickster on the tarmac...</p>
<p>Of course, we all know where this is leading and has been leading for eight years.  To Zero. (Obama)</p>
<p>It is is inescapable that once you wash off all the dung, zero will be sticking out with a pile of interoffice memos with his slimy name checked off, meaning he viewed them.</p>
<p>If you don\'t know how gubment works, dozens of agencies and individuals will review even the most closely held initiatives/agenda items/strategies.  Each is sent to the Department (say, Justice or Interior) that the policy is related to.  That Department will vet it.</p>
<p>Usually the Sec will pass it down to deputies to check to make sure a policy doesn\'t contradict existing law or policy; if so, they will suggest how to reconcile.  Of course, you want to have plausible deniability at this point.</p>
<p>Therefore, as each policy is circulated, there is a memo attached with a signoff sheet with everyone\'s name, or usually, initials on it - &quot;HC&quot; = Cankles (Hillary), &quot;JK&quot; = Haughty (Kerry), \'BO&quot; = Zero (Obama), and so on.</p>
<p>This was how investigators and special counsel could prove Reagen had no part in the diversion of funds in Iran-Contra.  Ollie North generated a memo, but it never got past John Poindexter.  &quot;RR&quot; was on no existing memo of the diversion.</p>
<p>Here\'s the thing about paperwork in gubment.  You think you &quot;got it all,&quot; but you never really do.  Some idiot, somewhere, always has the damn memo.  North thought he destroyed every copy, but one surfaced and that was it.  Game over.</p>
<p>So I guaran-dam-tee-you, Zero has memo from the FBI, most likely Combover (Comey), High Priest (Priestep-not added to nicknames yet), and MacBre (McCabe).</p>
<p>We know, via Sen. Ron Johnson\'s letter, that High Priest was cc-ing Zero because he said so in a text and worse: he said he was CHANGING Zero\'s title from &quot;president&quot; to a &quot;senior administration official&quot; so as to keep  Zero safe.</p>
<p>The moron High Priest provided investigators with the Rosetta Stone, with the text equivalent of Urim and Thummim to decipher all High Priest\'s text.  EVERY reference to a senior administration official in the texts = ZERO!!!!</p>
<p>So the fact that The Hill, even though its Atkisson, is now admitting that the DOJ knows, means the dam is very close to breaking.</p>
<p>So here is a bid admission.  I was wrong.</p>
<p>Up till now I thought the MAIN reason for not releasing stuff (the Memo) or not indicting people sooner was to protect sources, make sure everything jibed in docs internally in the case of the Memo and...in the case of not yet indicting, arresting people, that this has to be done ALL AT ONCE, in a massive mafioso-type sting.  That is all correct.  But now I think I missed something bigger.</p>
<p>The reason this is taking so long is that Sessions and DOJ have a crisis bigger than FBI/DOJ/CIA/DIA corruption/ partisanship on their hands.  Not only are they looking at the possibility of criminal charges to an ex-prez...which believe me would be massive (no president in American history has been served with serious criminal charges after his tenure).  But DOJ now has to consider EVERY investigation and case the FBI conducted during that period is tainted.</p>
<p>Ponder that for just a moment, and don\'t be flip.  This is incredibly serious stuff.  ALL would have to be reopened or re-srtarted.  Benghazi, Fast and Furious, other big investigations would have to be redone if Trump requests it.</p>
<p>Virtually EVERY major criminal case the FBI brought would now be under scrutiny.  You can see the defense counsels lining up across the country.  I\'m betting on top of everything else, Sessions and his team are getting ullcers over this.</p>
<p>Zero\'s and Combover\'s FBI have utterly destroyed American justice and not just by letting Cankles walk or Lerner skate.  These are big crimes.  But in terms of process and procedure their evil has screwed every aspect of justice for almost a decade now.&quot;</p>

           That of course would be U1, Benghazi (

           ), Fast and Furious, Lynchmob's meeting with the Slickster on the tarmac...
          </p>
          <p>
           Of course, we all know where this is leading and has been leading for eight years.  To Zero. (Obama)

           Therefore, as each policy is circulated, there is a memo attached with a signoff sheet with everyone's name, or usually, initials on it - "HC" = Cankles (Hillary), "JK" = Haughty (Kerry), 'BO" = Zero (Obama), and so on.

           This was how investigators and special counsel could prove Reagen had no part in the diversion of funds in Iran-Contra.  Ollie North generated a memo, but it never got past John Poindexter.  "RR" was on no existing memo of the diversion.

           </p>
           <p>
            Look up Larry Schweikart's bio online, the books written, etc.....This guy is an intellectual, grade A.
Build the bio, peruse the works on Amazon, then go with the linked Twitter info here....
           </p>
           <p>
            Funny, we are at the point...like the dog that chases cars, then catches one and doesn't know what to do with it....All the info is collected and in place.  Machete in hand, its time to lop the snake's head off, but without getting bitten.

              Agencies should get budgets based on performance...  Like a company.  Ugh.  Nevermind.  See the fbi would just frame motherfuckers for fake shit to get more money.  Well they do that now..  See its all so fucked we should just get less of it.  Like as little as possible..  This is how i got to such a small number.

             They'll need some kind of executive order or modified marshall law to stop angry Leftist judges from unleashing thousands from the prisons for new trials.....perhaps to force lawyers to show some evidence of malfeasance before allowing a new trial, etc....it would require a form of marshall law to survive Constitutional challenges.

              Yeahhhhhhhh... I like that.  Put the cia in the middle of fucking nowhere in north Dakota.  Actually just get rid of them completely now that I think of it.  Make them all get chipped with public tracking so they can't do secret shit any more.  Fuck them.

            The FBI are complicit most likely all these alphabet soup agencies are, CIA, NSA they're all in on it, they know that the dossier is a load of rubbish, and when questions are asked about why these government agencies wasted so much time and money trying to bring a case against an elected president they will probably sing like a flock of canaries and we will find out who they're working for cause it sure wasn't us.. We'll find out who's been pulling the strings.
