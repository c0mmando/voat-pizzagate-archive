<p>I looked up Gavin Newsom: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gavin_Newsom">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gavin_Newsom</a>. Newsom is a former mayor of San Francisco. Apparently he and Alice Waters were involved in spreading toxic sewage to gardeners in San Francisco. It was known as the Chez Sludge Scandal. <a href="https://www.prwatch.org/news/2010/07/9330/gavin-newsom-hopes-leave-his-sludge-san-francisco">https://www.prwatch.org/news/2010/07/9330/gavin-newsom-hopes-leave-his-sludge-san-francisco</a></p>
<p>Names like Abramovic teaching children art and James Alefantis made me suspicious of this movement. That as well as the pedo symbols. I wonder what this was all about.  I found this while skimming the Qresearch board.</p>

<p>This woman has ties everywhere.</p>
<p>Here is her Instagram again. Just look at who all she is pictured with. Obama, Corey Booker, Gavin Newsom, Willie Brown, Bill de Blasio, Al Gore.</p>
<p>I found all kinds of news articles on her. She had a foundation named Chez Panisse Foundation but a scandal called the Chez sludge involving Gavin Newsom brought her to change the name. It is now named The Edible Schoolyard Project. James Alefantis sits on the board. The SF chapter of TESP is operated through the Boys and Girls Club.</p>
<p>She knows HRC really well. Her daughters godmother is Susie Tompkins Buell. Susie\'s husband is board chairman of Chez. </p>

             I agree with most of your comments on the slow food movement and Chez Panisse. Why do you you comments get buried and lurkers are forced to press "show" in order to read your comments. This is censorship. I know nothing about the sludge scandal but would never eat food fertilized with human waste which is full of pharmaceuticals and residue from birth control pills which contribute to hormone disruption.  (Hmmm...does hormone disruption explain the proliferation of homosexuals and transgenders??) Anyway  I think a critical.eye is good to have here on pizzagate. I regard all posters here as sincere  but sometimes there is  faulty logic and great leaps of faith followed by indignation when they are corrected by a more informed  participant.
