            Ignore Esoteric's comment below. The video was deleted because Kevin Annett is a fraud.
           </p>
           <p>
            He invented several 'Courts' and an 'International Tribunal' that he runs from his living room. It has nothing to do with

            </a>
            possibly wanting to suppress this topic (sexual abuse and murder of Canadian children), as DeathTo and Esoteric keep insinuating.The issue is not the topic but Kevin Annett.
           </p>
           <p>
            I suggested to DeathTo a long time ago that he could post
            <em>
             any other
            </em>
            YT vid about the topic - there are dozens of them. But he didn't. I suggested he could do a research post about the topic. He never did.
           </p>
           <p>
            He only ever tried to post this specific video so that he could bitch about
            <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/user/Vindicator">

            </a>
            when he deleted it.
           </p>
           <p>
            He said he wanted to drink a beer with our beloved shill Donkeyhote, who said raping women was ok, and sexual abuse of children wasn't harmful.
           </p>
           <p>
            Go figure. He is a shill.
           </p>
           <h1>
           </h1>
           <p>
            <em>
             (And Esoteric, don't even try to argue that 'the victims are real'. Kevin Annett's MO is to hijack legit investigations, to push his own agenda. Maybe due to him being narcisstic or worse, maybe because he's a paid shill whose aim is to delegitimize investigations. I tend to think he's both. /end of discussion, Esoteric, on this subject matter).

             seems to me a shill would ingratiate himself and AVOID posting controversial things.  but hey youre the 'expert' right, MOD who turned this sub into a carbon copy of the Q sub.  well done btw, since Q has brought us so much new information that shills would seek to obscure:

               "I would personally rape every fertile white woman around if it meant our race would survive"  I stand by this statement, which doesn't say raping women in general is ok.  it's just okayer than our race dying out.

               being a child of a single-mother is more harmful than being sexually abused because it alone ALSO ENTAILS a 1000% increase in likelihood to suffer sexual abuse.  can your small female brain grasp compounding risk?  nice try at casual lying+slander, cunt.

             I think you may have curb stomped yourself on that interpretation of "auralsects" because I am fairly certain the user name means "sects or cults of light" which transfers into "the cult of lucifer" because Lucifer is known esoterically as "the light bringer." I'm fairly certain that all that went straight over your head.

                person was anyone else, but since it's that woman hating dumbass Donkey hote, who loves to talk about his penis and has told just about every female here to suck it, I guarante oral sex is exactly the meaning behind his name.

               I know its donkey. you knew I knew. donkey knew I knew. we all know. but donkey has been behaving himself better, and it trying to make more valid conversation that is not so racially volatile. So, I went with it. This is a comment by comment deal. I deal with comments, detail, and historical facts. I try to not get caught up in drama, and sometime I could fail, but I try not to fail. When I fail, call me out like a dog, and I will bark...ruff ruff

                Lies.   I would never lessen racial volitility.  Our motto is literally "gas the kikes; race war now." furthermore since women are incapable of accepting racial aspects of reality I will never stop pointing out that they're a liability and should gtfo.

                My whole purpose is to wake these fools up to the fact that PG is a mere symptom of the JQ. You're a "not all Jews tho" fag and thus an enemy to progress,  an idle theorist.  And effectively a race traitor.
               </p>
               <p>
                You can't show them how Trump and Q are stringing them along without providing the motive: killing time as whites become a minority, which benefits only the current racial minorities, of whom only Jews have any power or presence in PG.  Third-grader logic.

                  Before you start acting superior like you"figured out the new name" you need to go look up what "aural" means. Hint: it's doesn't mean light like you wrote yesterday.

            That was a legit Mil Falcon fuck up. Those victims are still alive. It is controversial because of how Kevin Arnett went about exposing it all. Arnett started an Internation Tribunal and the Crown refused to recognize the legitimacy of the tribunal. It is a thorny subject and the victims are real. If you watch this documentary you will see that its no joke. It is a hair raising deal.

            I understand your concerns, and I respect your knowledge and ability to research.  I am aligning myself against the people I despise- the pedo/Satanist politicians, the MSM, the Cabal, etc.

            Even if Q is a LARP, people are waking up.  I was at the sporting goods store yesterday to buy ammunition, and people were talking...  It was very interesting to overhear it.

           <p>
            Yes, you are right.  I thought that certain events would have happened by now, such as high level arrests.  I was not happy to see Hillary in India, but then she came back and attended that event with a coven of witches.  LOL.
           </p>

            I am not sure if Hillary still has that hole in her tongue from Kuru disease...

            I have to admit that the answer to that is not really. I have looked a little bit but pizzagate has obviously been my main focus. I don't have anything bad to say about voat. I'm just a little burned out right now bro. pizzagate is a tough subject and I have personal experience in real life with it. I won't labor you with it though. I have met some damn good people here on voat.

             I understand. There is a lot more that I could say about all this, but, I don't think I will. The Zionist bot army fake patriots have swarmed and they spend millions. You have always tried to maintain the balance and keep it from becoming partisan and I salute you for that. I'm sort of in the mood that "can't fight city hall" and packing my bags. I hate to be a quitter, but, maybe I am. I can't demod all these people so I guess it will be what it is. I have though, made some good buddies with REAL EYES along the way. I consider you to be one of those. Take care good buddy, we may talk again....

               My mind is always open for new data. This is what I know about the new Silk Road at the moment. Basically, its beginning and ending points. I understand that the geopolitical struggles we are witnessing are directed around trade. The flow of commerce is the flow of "currency" and it all goes hand in hand.

               This is a Google Earth kmz file that I personally made myself while listening to a video of the route of the new silk road trading route. I made this file myself so I promise you that it is not dangerous. This is what we are witnessing in the world. This is why Yemen is in deep shit with Saudia Arabia and why Yemen is so important to the globalists, that, ahem...Trump is funding...is what it is. Pro tip, play the file in tour mode.

            These Q News nutjobs banned me from their discord for hate speecha against pedophiles, then tracked down my skype afterwards and said ha ha ha (numerif the aussie gay pedo mod there). I wouldn't trust anything coming from Q, which I believe to be Robert David Steele who failed to start his own open-source intelligence agency until he re-branded it to Q.

             My prediction is that the Q Tards will get this site shut down for hate speech cyber bullying. I am always honest, and I am right more often than I am wrong. I hope I am wrong this time, but I feel like I will be right.  They are completely irresponsible and out of control.

             I'm pretty sure that is where I getting ready to be. I love all my pizzagate buddies but I need to decompress. I have done this for years and I need to get some distance. I feel like an old pizzagate grandfather, and probably a grumpy one :)

               Its not so much what I catch that is important, its the art of, and the act of, fishing. Sitting beside the water and watching the wildlife. But, we have HUGE fucking catfish if a man is brave enough grab one by the mouth. They taste good too. We have knack for finding bottom feeders :) We ain't scared either :) Thank you my friend for all the things you taught me. Walter Veith being the most important. Veith is a beacon of light.

                Cool!  We have some nice sized catfish, too, but I prefer trout fishing.  You are right, though, it is just great being out there doing something.
               </p>
               <p>
                I am not sure I would want to catch them by hand.  With my luck, I would find a snapping turtle.
               </p>
               <p>
                No problem!  I learned way more from you since I am relatively new to this.

                If you really do leave, I hope you check back periodically to say hello and see how things are going.  I suspect that The Cabal will not go down without a fight.  That is my gut feeling.  It will get much worse before it gets better.

              Haha 😂 na , I don't think grumpy just frustrated.. that's how I feel too . I moved literally off grid (except cell service .. sometimes ) and have not heard one television story since the 12th of March . I'm loving it ! I definitely had to decompress from the no end in sight PG saga !

                Shit!  I started learning about this stuff in October 2016 with the Podesta email release, and I am fucking tired of it.  I just want my normal life back, and I am sure that many people feel that way.

                 Nope. Sorry. This is like the song "Hotel California." You can check in, but you can never leave. Because, once you know, you won't forget.

                      Haha!   You know about the esoteric stuff, and have been researching it a lot longer than I have.  It is pretty scary just how important it is in order to explain world history and current events.

                      I think that Trump has to do something to put The Cabal out of its misery before the mid-term elections.  I have a feeling that The Cabal will throw the mid-term elections in order to get enough votes to impeach Trump.  Trump cannot wait that long.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                      I still believe that Trump, Wikileaks, and others have enough information to destroy The Cabal.

            what the anon alleged and show why you disagree with it (citing the anon and the Q posts in question,
            <strong>

             How about how nothing Q says comes true? All the arrest Q said were going down but never happens. Q lying about the way things work and acts like the cabal is finished when they are in full control. Stop it with this bullshit.

             Actually, I just expected this to get deleted. But, a poster here wants to talk about the Silk Road, which is the child trafficking route, too. What sort of link do i need for the post to live. I am willing to educate about the Silk Road.

             My premise is obvious. Q is not a valid source of information. That is obvious. If it not obvious, then, perhaps, I will have to go fishing this summer instead of continue to help

              was a shill and I made a thread to that effect.  I'd be a little more sympathetic to you if you had been half as vocal in calling them out before -- particularly since they installed a whole crew of Q-followers as mods,  especially the egregious shill
              <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/user/Blacksmith21">
               @Blacksmith21

             </p>
             <p>
              The wider problem here is that to consider Q a damage control psyop you'd have to also doubt Trump,  which few want to do. They don't want to accept Trump is controlled opposition par excellence.  Things could not be going better for The Tribe.

                I wouldn't laugh so loud if I were you. You been a whole year and you don't jack shit about Jesuits, fake jews, secret societies, Freemasons, or nothing. You need to STFU and learn some shit. That is my advice to you, Mr. Know It All Nothing But Hillary Clinton.

               If I was a shill, why would I be having open discussions with other mods regarding leaving posts up that technically should be deleted?  You don't do your homework very well, post uncited bullshit, and have a very obvious agenda - that of the true shill.
              </p>
              <p>
               Most of us are well versed in the ways of the shill and your tactics are very obvious, albeit pathetic in nature.
              </p>
              <p>
               A quick look of your history shows that you are NOT an original contributor of any content on this sub, but your misogyny and racism shines through clearly.  Hallmark of a true shill.  How much per hour do you get paid?
              </p>
              <p>
               So, you think you're hot shit?  Call me out.  If I'm a shill, demonstrate why.  Otherwise go fuck yourself.

                The wider problem here is that to consider Q a damage control psyop you'd have to also doubt Trump, which few want to do. They don't want to accept Trump is controlled opposition par excellence. Things could not be going better for The Tribe.

               I can't argue with that. Trump just gave Saudia Arabia 100 Billion dollars to further devastate the Middle East and crush Iran, Yemen, and everybody else that disagrees with Israel. Its all about those oil pipe lines. The Q followers pretend not to know, or, more probably, really do not know about all the pipe lines. They do not understand global petro flow.
