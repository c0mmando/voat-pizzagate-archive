            What good does it do the pizzagate investigation to have someone's SSN? If this could help stop crime, shouldn't this be handled responsibly, like giving this info to one of George's friends in intel? He used to work for the CIA, right? Shouldn't they be informed rather than random nobodies on the internet? I don't get it.

               Yes it would be terrible if a criminal got ahold of another criminal's social security number and went to Walmart to buy a TV. That other criminal who claims to be dead should really be worried that someone will ruin his credit since he's got like Gillions of dollars from raping kids. I hope someone doesn't get a hold of John Podesta's SSN because that would just be an unfair advantage in the investigation for all these kids and could do nobody any good whatsoever such as you know proving someone is a real person who exists or something, or like um, alerting the authorities to the whereabouts of the people spoofing his identity etc.

            When not promoting the official narrative of "muslims did it" and other known false flag operations, Webb is promoting the release of metadata. Is this Hegelian Dialectic at play? Problem, reaction, solution.
           </p>
           <p>
            Webb is actually supporting more invasions of our privacy as evidenced by publishing social security numbers of a person "alleged" by him.
           </p>
           <p>
            This is not a good direction and I cannot support this.

            </p>
            <p>
             Which Muslims? Webb is clearly on the side of Turkey's Erdogan in calling for Feta Gulan's extradition. And Webb has gone out of his way to defend Muslims. The whole reason he's doing this is he stood up for a Muslim kid who was basically entrapped by the FBI and tried for what really looks like "fake terror". Andrew McCabe of the FBI put Webb on some shit list somewhere and made his life miserable until he fought back by making youtube videos.

              "George Webb keeps bringing up False Flags and hoaxes and treats them as if they were real or like they happened according to what we hear in the main stream media, like the Omar Mateen from the Orlando shooting hoax, Tsarnaev Brothers from the Boston Bombing hoax, the Facebook shooter Steve Stevens hoax or the 9/11 false flag?
             </p>
             <p>
              Lately George focuses on connecting Muslims to all kinds of crimes and events without providing a convincing argument for why he is doing it and what the link is between those crimes and Muslims like the Awan Brothers and others.
             </p>
             <p>
              He seems to just jump from place to place and from one investigation to another, without any conclusion or closure, like for example he connected Awan Brothers to Eric Breverman, to the murder of Seth Rich, to Seal Team 7, to a murder of the two teenage girls, and to other crimes, it is hard to keep track and to follow his reasoning and to understand why he is doing what he is doing or why he is going where he is going and knocking on people’s doors. Also, I don’t understand why he is publishing peoples social security numbers and addresses, it doesn‘t seem right.
             </p>
             <p>
              He seems to have switched from investigating the deep state and elites criminals to investigating various Muslims and connecting them to all kind of crimes. One of the red flags that bothered me was when George Webb started taking about 9/11 mosques and radical Islamic terrorists connected to 9/11 – it is obviously pointing us in the wrong direction and misinformation, pointing us in the direction of people who were falsely blamed for 9/11 away from the real criminals who are behind 9/11 like CIA/Mossad/deep state/traitors in our government."

               You obviously haven't watch his latest videos. The ones yesterday he mentioned how the Deep State have outsourced their devious deeds to private security contractors. Those aren't Muslims. They're Americans. They're totally oblivious to the greater fraud but they're Americans as sad as that is to say.

                He "recruited" many people into his fake investigation at the beginning but where are those people now? How many of his original supporters are still there?   (That's a rhetorical question)

                 height &amp; weight first. and also a full accounting of your personal history since you seem to have found yourself worthy of calling someone a "predator"
                </p>
                <p>
                 Also please identify yourself fully and completely are would ask you to discontinue. Your expectations seem to be imply that Webb has not been truthful about his background so therefore his investigatory findings deserve no credence.
                </p>
                <p>
                 If that is your standard the same goes for you. Unless you are willing to fully disclose and be "truthful" of your background your findings deserve no credence.
                </p>
                <p>
                 Most of us recognize anonymity has its benefits (safety) but challenges (any a**whole or paid shill) can jump on to attack anyone. We are willing to follow the rules that way. Apparently you are not.
                </p>
                <p>
                 By the way Webb has provided complete disclosure including FOIA requests to the FBI, CIA, NSA to release all information pertaining to him under his full name and DOB and SSN on line so that it could be read by anyone. This was done over a year ago and was requested it be posted on line pending his death.
                </p>
                <p>
                 He also released his current address, the name and occupation of his son who anyone would be proud of. He just graduated as a doctor from the top medical school in the country. He gave specific warnings after his slides were hacked about 50 episodes in that he was aware his life was in danger and that the videotapes, thumbdrives, documents, photographs, &amp; other evidence was in locations where it would continue regardless.
                </p>
                <p>
                 He only published the names and SSN numbers of the Awan brothers because they are illegal numbers and because he has notified Director MCAbe for 180 days to do something before others are killed.
                </p>
                <p>
                 McCabe did nothing, except his wife took $700,000 from HRC buddy during email investigation while McCabe was in charge.

                 Lol. Let me get this straight. George Webb is helping uncover human, organ and drug rat lines that are used to generate Black Budgets for rogue elements in the CIA, FBI and/or the Deep State.
                </p>
                <p>
                 You don't side with George Webb. You side with those who think the CIA, FBI and/or the Deep State are incapable of such crimes.

             More likely he is uncovering all of the people who are "doing it" including the Muslims who are participating in human trafficking by entering our country using favors from HRC, and he publishes the SSN of the person who is behind human trafficking to prove that he's still alive and what his name is.

             Have a feeling you are right. Immediate danger is that Nanoset Technology is involved in removing routers and "doping" them placing back in US, which is complicated but allows Pakistan ISI aka Muslim Brhood to get TS classified and geospatial info on people.
            </p>
            <p>
             There has been mention that at least 22 million veterans personal data was stolen including addresses etc.
            </p>
            <p>
             If you have a group like Pakistan ISI Awan Brothers who on their very Facebook pages they pay homage to horriffic terrorism having access to veterans ID this should be a National Threat.
            </p>
            <p>
             This is why George Webb posted all their addresses, D.O.B. and SS numbers (which they hold, many even from dead people) They also own multiple million dollar homes in various locations up to 12 at a time. Some of these homes are safe houses used for MS-13 gang members brought in to perform assasinations.

            The Awan brothers are part of Pakistan ISI that is like the CIA. They have infiltrated our government under Obama/Clinton getting access to the whitehouse an Top secret security clearance and visas. They are involved with HRC &amp; gang in bringing in Heroin directly into Chicago OHare and into pain clinics where real patients or in VA's veterans are given watered down or even bogus medication and opioids which are made from heroin are "passed through" leading to addictions and deaths of epidemic proportions.
           </p>
           <p>
            They are also involved in child trafficking, organ harvesting &amp; worse. There is a specific reason Chicago turned into the number one murder City with over 4000 people killed and Obama said nothing.
           </p>
           <p>
            Never even visited in 8 years. HRC &amp; all of them. It is disgusting.
           </p>
           <p>
            Including Deputy Director A. McCabe who Webb has outed as being involved in covering up HRC crimes.

              IDK, but when my husband tried to get a DL in the state we live in right now where we have lived for over 4 years the DMV said he could not do it without a birth certificate. We had with us proof of address, SS Card and his out of state DL. They said that is not good enough and I asked how they could deny the SS Card and they said even illegal aliens can get those. I wonder if Barack Obama could get a DL in my state.

              It is very easy for non-citizens to get SSN numbers. In fact these guys have several. Will not explain the process on a forum because it is illegal and also because CIA &amp; other spy or intelligence services get them.
             </p>
             <p>
              Secondly do any of you geniuses like

              who are calling people sock puppets have a clue to whom you might be speaking whether that is Webb or any other researcher on this forum.
             </p>
             <p>
              When you state such a total disregard for truth such as posting the Awan brothers SSN as if they are somehow being doxed? Do you even realize how idiotic you are? Their numbers and addresses were posted because they each have multiple SSN, up to 12 houses in the D.C., Va area alone. Every house has found to be a MS-13 safe house.
             </p>
             <p>
              You are so arrogant or trying so hard for people to not follow the Webb's series you look like the amateurs you are.
             </p>
             <p>
              Have you ever wondered why Webb has all the info. he does? How does he wander to these doors? How is he in possession of videotape of actual crime scene footage?
             </p>
             <p>
              You might want to think about that. You only get that information one way. It is provided by good guys on the inside. Like the FBI &amp; NSA who he has stated on numerous occasions have secretly delivered thumbdrives of info to him urging him to tell the story and help them.
             </p>
             <p>
              Do you ever wonder why he has not been shot or otherwise maimed? Most others have. Could he possibly have protection? Think about it especially as you call people sock puppets you have no idea what you are talking about.
             </p>
             <p>
              You lay into Webb for naming muslims. Do you realize he was first put under the Disrupt campaign by McCabe for standing by a Muslim kid in 2010 to stop him for being framed.Again you are an idiot.
             </p>
             <p>
              He is not even going after them now he is going after ISI &amp; CIA &amp; FBI crooks. The good guys are helping him and there are many.
             </p>
             <p>
              He also has not gone after 9/11 mosques as you say do your homework and watch the whole series before you you waltz in to attack the messenger. By the way the whole  "Jem777 really is Jem8" was genius how long did it take to calculate this mathmatical formula that makes no sense? Or did you open up a Cracker Jack box and get inspired?

               well that's quite a response to a simple question, so thank you. I actually haven't watched any George Webb videos so you might want to repost this as a new thread, my internet sucks for video so I read the comments first/instead.

                In short you are either actively working against truth which means you are not an idiot but incredibly sinister or you have not done the depth of research or have the breadth of knowledge to understand what is actually happening.
               </p>
               <p>
                I do not need to spend time giving synopsis of George's work in fact I hate it. I as well as others do it so others who have not been able follow along or do not have the in depth training and experience can read about in a story format.
               </p>
               <p>
                Do you really believe we can pull this information out of a hat like a rabbit. That it could be made up if we tried. I for one would write a novel and get paid money for it.
               </p>
               <p>
                This is truth. It is unfortunate I wish it were not so. Help uncover it put your focus to good work.
               </p>
               <p>
                By the way George never discounted pizzagate. He has on many times brought it up and Voat up. Read between the lines.

             Yes the cocaine that is brought in from  Pakistan in Mangoes.  Yes those famous Mangoes in the email.  I forget the Bros that are located in Skokie Il.  where the loaded Mangoes are delivered from the airport.  Boy when this blows up, I can't wait.  That rat Emanuel that Obama has guarding  all of the drug and sex trafficking and organ harvesting will be boiled in oil.  I have seen on here that June 10th is an important day, I wonder why.

             <p>
              It is not cocaine that is brought in through mangoes it is heroin. Let me explain why and how based on a legal background and understanding of how this works.
             </p>
             <p>
              From the days of Lucky Luciano (mobster) drugs were brought in to the US through illicit means. One of the earliest was through fruit. They hollowed out fruit primarily citrus and filled it with illicit drugs most often heroin.
             </p>
             <p>
              There were several reasons for this. First the obvious disguise it created while being shipped in. Secondly citrus has a very strong smell which narco dogs aren't fond of. Disguising the heroin mangoes within the regular mangoes was important.
             </p>
             <p>
              Next they had to centralize the location the mangoes would be shipped into because they had Been barred prior to 2009-2010 due to the lack of irridation facilities and procedures in Pakistan. This facilitated that incests like fruit flies, and other diseases could not be transferred to the US.
             </p>
             <p>
              So after OBama &amp; HRC take office a huge irridation facility is built in Iowa ( why Iowa no answer yet) At the same time an article is leaked stating the Obama Whitehouse &amp; HRC had approved for the first time that Pakistan Mangoes could be imported to the US. Of course they failed to mention they would only be allowed to be flown directly to Chicago O'hare airport. Why?
             </p>
             <p>
              Those of us that have experience with narco dogs know citrus (like mangoes)are used to throw off the dogs scent of illicit drugs that are packed in the middle of cargo. A hired hit man or operative is brought in to remove &amp;unload the good mangoes and then the heroin mangoes are unloaded into other trucks or go on different routes.
             </p>
             <p>
              As I wrote earlier this has been done throughout time, but normally by illegal actors in the US. In recent times this has changed. The most famous case is the Mena, Arkansas case where cocaine was flown in to Mena and weapons were flown out to the contras as part of IRan-Contra...Remeber Bill Clinton was Arkansas attorney General at the time and being slammed with allegations of rape &amp; other saudry affairs. He was protected though because he was the CIA's boy under George H. W. Bush. Unbelievable he would go on to win the presidency.
             </p>
             <p>
              The CIA drug running is also well documented in Gary Webb's story. He lost his life most likely by homocide although suicide was ruled the reason.
             </p>
             <p>
              The movie "Kill the messenger is based on many of these so called journalist suicides.
             </p>
             <p>
              It is quite interesting that Obama Chief of staff Rahm Emanuel ( who by the way liked to spend time in Chicago gay bath houses with Obama as a community organizer, then Senate) was then sent out of the Chief of Staff position of the blue to take the job of Mayor of Chicago.
             </p>
             <p>
              He also says nothing about the 4000 murders, but on top of that withholds a videotape confirming a homocide of a teenager that would have looked bad on his re-election until the day after he won and it was revealed the city paid a multi million dollars lawsuit to the family.
             </p>
             <p>
              Another area Rahm can be investigated is his ties to Uber company which most don't know about. How he controlled the market to exclude competition when his family &amp; friends and himself made a ton of money!
             </p>
             <p>
              Why would Obama or Rahm Emanuel or HRC who are all natives of Chicago not go to Chicago and speak about the thousands of lives being lost? Why dint Obama never speak about these horrendous crimes as President happening in his home city? Why did he not even go visit these ravaged communities to bring awareness? Why rush a consent decree in the final month in Chicago against the Police Officers who are actually in a war zone?
             </p>
             <p>
              Why are there reported places where you can revive $5000 dollars for turning in a dead body?
Why is melanin a high valued substance that is presen in higher amounts is some victims?
             </p>
             <p>
              These questions need answers?

                I think Jem777 aka Jem8 are Webb's sock puppets. He has stated numerous times that he doesn't believe in pizzagate yet his 'work" is constantly spammed on here. You can't it have it both ways.

               Thank you again, for your always valuable information.  Always you are teaching me.  As 'some of us watch the news and see the news of the killings in Chicago, we who know about the organ harvesting and sex trafficking know why they are after these black children and other blacks as well.  The melanin in their skin, imo, may be because it protects from skin cancer.  Also they are after the pineal gland of the younger children.  I would not want to meet Emanuel in a dark alley for I see him as intensely  mean and dangerous and what  Obama is allowing to happen to his own people is unspeakable.  Up voats are in order for you.

              The Awan Brothers are the suspects that George Webb basically says most likely broke into many Congressional offices and stole shit. Probably laptops etc. Go to YouTube, type in George Webb, and watch his videos. It should catch you up.
