            Good idea to share stories  (they are relevant) - I have a hunch there are quite a few.
           </p>
           <p>
            I was 5-6 and was walking with my best friend down an alley that connected our houses about 6 blocks apart. This was back when kids were free to roam the neighborhoods where front doors were left unlocked. We were right alongside her back yard when a brown car pulled up to us. The driver, a 20-something guy, scraggly, dirty opened the door and the passenger, also scruffy and dirty got out and came to where we were standing on the driver's side of the car.  They gestured toward the back where there were candybars and dollar bills placewd on the back seat. "Hey - you want some candy or money?" they said - trying different phrases to coax us - promises of puppies or kittens and more candy. And the one guy started walking towards us to grab us. It all happened so fast. And we immediately ran off toward her backyard gate and got away.
           </p>
           <p>
            Had either of us been alone somewhere else further from our house, we would not have been able to get away. The other thing that saved me was instinct - the guys looked scary and I didn't like what was going on.This was before "stranger danger" was a thing and before anyone talked to kids about dangerous situations like that. The other weird thing is - I never told anyone about it until months later. At the time, I really had no idea how big a deal it was. Thank my lucky stars. And thankfully, kids are more educated about this these days.

            Guy tried to take me when I was a senior in high school. I fought back. He got me 3 times with a 7 inch blade, came 1 inch from my heart. Somehow I still walk the earth. That was 21 years ago.

            Similar experience at 6; a man in a van tried to lure me and a friend into his van with candy as we were walking home from school past a mall parking lot. Teach your children! Stranger danger! This was a super safe neighborhood in a town known to be "kid-safe" ...

             I used to walk home alone when I was younger because I lived on the same block as my elementary school. Now, I understand why parents almost never leave their kids alone and always pick them up.

            I think A LOT of people have similar stories. Here's mine:
            <br/>
            I was about 7. A kid that I'd guess was 10-11 came up to me. I knew all the kids in the neighborhood, he wasn't familiar. He was dressed weird, in a white jumpsuit with studs- think Elvis. And a bowl haircut. He gestured at me to come to him. I shook my head no. He gestured again, never said anything, but tried to convince me to follow him. As I refused, he nervously looked off behind a building, like he was being prompted. I took off running.
            <br/>
            I always thought that was weird, and as I got older and learned more, I really think it was an attempt to recruit me using a kid already trapped in it... the way he looked was so odd.
            <br/>
            My SO has a stoy, too. Was walking with a friend and a guy pulled up and offered them a ride and a free bike. After they refused and he drove off, a cop pulled up a few minutes later, asking if a guy had offered them a ride. He'd been cruising all day.

            A man knocked on my apartment door when I was younger. I didn't know any better and opened it. Luckily my parents were right behind him. Don't keep your kids alone unsupervised! That's how Madeline McCann disappeared.

            As a kid a middle-aged couple drove by and tried to get me in the car too.      I think if it were today they'd have more drugging, chloroform methods, but they still have to get a person close enough to chloroform them.
            <br/>
            I've heard the same  thing applies to women abductors who ask for directions or assistance, and  then  their helpers show up.

             Yup, always be aware. I see the people on their phones walking on the streets and they are so aloof! If you walk with purpose and quickly, you will be less of a target. Predators don't like prey that bite back.
