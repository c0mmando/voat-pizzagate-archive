           This may not help the current state of things but I think it's something important to know. This happened elsewhere, they went further than us and here's how it turned out:
          </p>
          <p>
           1 July 2014 - MP Simon Danczuk calls on former Home Secretary Leon Brittan to say what he knew about paedophile allegations passed to him in the 1980s
          </p>
          <p>
           7 July - Government announces independent inquiry into the way public bodies investigated and handled child sex abuse claims. Baroness Butler-Sloss chosen as head
          </p>
          <p>
           9 July - Baroness Butler-Sloss faces calls to quit because her late brother, Sir Michael Havers, was attorney general in the 1980s
          </p>
          <p>
           14 July - She stands down, saying she is "not the right person" for the job
          </p>
          <p>
           5 September - Lord Mayor of London Fiona Woolf named the new head of the inquiry
          </p>
          <p>
           11 October - Mrs Woolf discloses she had five dinners with Lord Brittan from 2008-12
          </p>
          <p>
           22 October - Abuse victim launches legal challenge against Mrs Woolf leading the inquiry, amid growing calls for her resignation
          </p>
          <p>
           31 October - Victims' groups tell government officials they are "unanimous" Mrs Woolf should quit. She steps down later that day
          </p>
          <p>

          </p>
          <p>
           So we think it's all good until this happens in August 2016 (not sure why it was only reported in November):
           <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/11/08/lowell-goddard-branded-a-disgrace-after-refusing-to-appear-befor/">

           </a>
          </p>
          <p>
           And this is where it's at now:
