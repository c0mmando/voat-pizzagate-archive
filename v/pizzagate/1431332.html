            There are pedophile that don't do shit though. We can't round up people for simply being pedophiles. It's rape and abuse that is the problem and its the people who commit those crimes we need to round up.

            The article from the NYT about pedophilia not being a crime was from
            <em>
             2014
            </em>
            not Tuesday, unless there was a different one you found. It was submitted to Reddit this week so some assumed it was published recently. Also it's true that pedophilia isn't crime in and of itself but I can see how thinking the original article was posted the day before would raise some suspicion.

            Men should be separated from women. I don't care about a mans supposed rights or feelings. I care about the potential damage caused to countless women and families. A man cannot be allowed to roam free in the same society where women are.

            Who owns The NY Times? Rothchild Zionism- AKA The  Talmudist's &amp; their 'Christian Zionist dupes' are the overlords of all that's evil. How many 'dual citizens' are in high US gov positions? They are systematically ruining the US and all we hold dear. The same murderers of Palestinian children are now training US police forces. Bush instated foreign military contractor's to train US cops. Since then police shooting citizens has risen by 500%. They're helping to shred our US Constitution &amp; ruin our children's minds with cultural marxism. When we watch the old anti communist videos, we see why we were warned. We also see the freedoms, we've lost to Rothchild Zionism. Thank God for Brother Nathanael, TrueTorahJews, IfAmericansKnew , Cynthia McKinney, Roger Waters (PinkFloyd) and many others who're speaking truths despite the constant and open death threats .Keep speaking out. We owe it to our children, ourselves, the world &amp; the future of humanity.

            I posted 1 top level comment to point out this one thing. Afterwards People kept replying TO ME
while claiming my comment is wrong and not only is it illegal to be pedophile it also should be punished with
death just as I deserve death because I defend the pedos and things the like.
           </p>
           <p>
            So no my friend it wouldn't get tedious here if people here (including you) would stop replying to my comments which did state nothing but the truth.
I didn't reply first to anyone here.
           </p>
           <p>
            And I don't give a fuck if you think I'm being apologetic I call this being objective.
Human minds destroyed by other people and thus not able to function right are victims and nothing else.
I will keep repeating that as long as you guys want to hear it and keep calling for more.

            That's garbage, and it's really concerning that this is upvoated on here. There's all kinds of things to take your mind off of things, and to break mental addictions. Many people have completely broken addictions, or do you think people that haven't smoked in 30 years still think about them cigarettes all the time.

             It's only upvoted because most of us cannot (yet) downvote. If you think for one second that this site isn't being flooded by shills, then you haven't been paying attention. I agree with you 100% though, I'm just out of upvotes today.

            Yes because it is true. I knew one boy when I was 6 years old. He was 8 and I didn' know it at this time, but he was kidnapped and held captive
by a rapist.
           </p>
           <p>
            I only learned this years later when my mother told me, but it explained a lot.
He was very sardistic, sexualized (tried to do sexual stuff to other children, occasionally stripped naked and the like), liked it to bondage or cage/ trap other children
and just acted very wiered/ said very strange things which only made sense for me years later...
           </p>
           <p>
            He was clearly reproducing stuff that was done to him. This is how people work. So this sardistic child that abuses other children, victim or offender?
Kill? Kill now or later? Or try to help him process what was done to him in order to maybe give him the chance to have a somewhat normal live? Tell me what is the cool thing to do here?

            So yes thats what I suggested kill them when they turn 18, nice. So this boy who was raped by a monster should get 10 more years to suffer and then be shot by a fucking redneck like you because he has a broken sexuality caused by being raped instead of having like the chance to make a therapy....cool
           </p>
           <p>
            I only knew this boy when he was 8 years old, but it was very obv. that he will either have to go a long road of therapy and stuff or that he will get to be an offender him self.
But since he was only 8 years old and also traumatized he didn't really had much influence about which way he will go.
It's more about what the parents do in such a case. A child surely will never say "I think I need a therapy" 
Most parents of course would look for help/ therapy though.
In his case though his father was a freaking motherfucking idiot. 
He didn't try to help in any way, he punished him.
He regulary would beat him up for misbehaving... BEATING UP A TRAUMATIZED CHILD FOR MISSBEHAVING AFTER BEEING RAPED BY A MONSTER FOR WEEKS!
Anyway I think one can clearly say that in this case the discision if he becomes a good person or a bad one was made by few other peoples and not much by him self.
He probably is in jail now or dead, but what ever he has done I wouldn't judge him BECAUSE I KNOW HE IS A VICTIM. Better kill his father and of course the one who raped him.

            Gaawd how can one be so dense!? What else besides your word do I got that you wont rape any woman?
It's pretty obv., that you are a hetero male, so I know, that you feel very atracted to women. By your logic 
One should kill you now, because you are a potential rapist and we have nothing but your word...

            All of you need to relax for a second and stop debating the morality (or lack thereof) when it comes to pedophiles who haven't abused anyone or even acted on their desires. Let's stick to our primary purpose here, which is not philosophical debate. Pizzagate does NOT concern individuals who haven't acted on their pedophilic desires - there are clear implications of child trafficking, exploitation, and even possible satanic ritual abuse.
           </p>
           <p>
            Please guys, let's be reasonable here and not let a philosophical disagreement derail our primary purpose - we need to keep investigating this and continue to uncover the connections between all these individuals, the Clinton Foundation, etc. I'm sure the shills would like nothing more than to divide us and incite conflict within our group, but please, don't give them what they want.
           </p>

            Thank you, I'm out. Happy thanksgiving to all of you Americans.

            Sorry but the left have been targeting pedophile elite for a lot longer than righties, especially since it was Thatcher's cabinet who had nasty child sex parties without the public's knowledge. We shouldn't be talking about left and right. Its pointless. Members of both sides of the political spectrum are committing these acts.

            Don't molest kids. Don't help people molest kids. DONT WATCH PEOPLE MOLEST KIDS. It's wrong. It spreads the cancer and is a form of participation in those kids' torture. Find a therapist, not an online support group. Either way this isn't it and you're cluttering up an investigation with this bullshit.

              Actually you semi-sarcastically argued that the possession of CP shouldn't be illegal. You are a shill. Gtfo or  stop filling valuable posts with irrelevant nonsense.

            Yeah sure I need a bullet to my head because I understand the current law wich states that beeing a pedophile 
is no crime perse. And because I think that someone who did not harm anyone in any way doesn't deserve punishment.
This is totally crazy I know. I'm just saying all this because I want to fuck children my self probably.
           </p>
           <p>
            Dude seriously if you tell me, that some of these sick fucks are trying to legalize this shit I don't even answer back.
And when it comes to fight this I stand on your fucking side you moron.
           </p>
           <p>
            But this "kill all pedos" mentality is just retarded. Yes, there are pedos, who really just suffer but harm nobody. 
You ever thought about what happens to a persons mind who got raped as a child?
It's very well known, that most pedos were abused when they were children as well.
           </p>
           <p>
            So when seeing this, at which point you think we should start to kill children who were victims of sexual abuse?
Because we know, they will probably have pedophile thoughts them selfes at some point and we can not allow one to have pedophile thoughts, right?
So kill them when they turn 18?
How much does a VICTIM deserve punishment?
How much punishment does a broken soul deserve for beeing broken? Even if the person did not harm anyone!?
           </p>
           <p>
            Seriously for me it's looks pretty damn simple. Everything that harms another person should be illegal everything else should be legal.

            Yeah but this is pretty stupid. Not every pedophile is also a rapist/ child molester and not every child molester is a pedophile.
So by locking all pedophiles away you would not protect all children, but punish many innocent people who never did anything to anyone.
And you call this a solution?
           </p>
           <p>
            You care about the potential? So by this logic every hetero man and actually also every women is a potential rapist because they feel sexually attracted 
to other men or women.
           </p>
           <p>
            This is bullshit. I'm all for protecting everyone, not just children from being raped, but not if that means that we must lock away every human being who didn't do nothing. -.-

            I would say I find it interesting that there is no mention of all the connections to wikileaks, but it's not interesting at all. It's so obvious what is happening here to anyone who is paying attention.

            It mainly argues for the rights of pedophiles who haven't acted on abusing children. It also tries to argue that sexually abusing children doesn't make someone a pedophile. "...pedophilia is a status and not an act. In fact, research shows, about half of all child molesters are not sexually attracted to their victims".

             Nah. That's silly to think. I'm totally open to thoughts of all kinds of conspiring and manipulation tactics used by media, but a single article giving a voice to a pedophile, assuming I remember the article people are talking about, is no proof of them having a pro-pedophile agenda. I would say that's probably one of the
             <em>
              few
             </em>
             pieces of evidence they have that they
             <em>
              aren't
             </em>
             constantly fucking biased about reporting.

             It's disconcerting to you when people like to stick with facts?
And does being pedophile imply being in possesion of cp?
            </p>
            <p>
             I am hetero, does that mean that I for sure own pornography and rape women? NO
            </p>
            <p>
             Same applies to pedophiles.
            </p>
            <p>
             I didn't even read the article, but if it is like op claims and they just wrote exactly this, that it is not illegal 
being pedophile it self then they are just right. This is not normalizing anything...
            </p>
            <p>
             And pizzagate does definetly not profit from people who obv. have problems to understand certain terms.
Calling all those people involved in pizzagate pedophiles is already wrong in my eyes. I highly doubt, that all of them ONLY feel atracted to preteen children. Most of them are just monsters, rapists or what ever who don't even stop at children.
It's more about the feeling to have power over others, to feel like being abled to do what others can't do, also satanism probably is a reason.
            </p>
            <p>
             Seriously, calling those sick fucks pedophiles is an insult for every actual pedophile. Those fucks are way worse than people who just can't help about their attraction to children.

              You commented that raping children is a crime (thanks for the great info), so I simply said so is being in possession of child pornography. You’re acting like there are all these pedophiles out there. There isn’t. It’s not normal. FACT. Talking about it like it is is wrong. Stop. I’m sticking to the facts. You’re the one that seems to have an agenda.

               Being pedophile is not against the law. Not in my country and probably not in yours. FACT
              </p>
              <p>
               Why did you reply to this with "so is possesion of cp" thanks for the great info? 
No, you tried to imply that pedos always own cp and therefor are criminals.

              <p>
               "You’re acting like there are all these pedophiles out there. There isn’t. It’s not normal."
What the fuck are you actually trying to say? Neither I nor anyone else said it's normal to be pedophile.

               Seriously, english isn't my native language so I'm always a little concerned I get something wrong, but in this case I feel like I'm talking with someone who doesn't
understand any language at all.

                You put raping children is a crime. I responded with so is possession of child pornography. I was simply stating something else a pedophile might do that is against the law. Raping anyone is against the law. Some porn is legal. There is your difference. That wasn’t the main point though. Yes, I can tell english is not your native language. You write it well enough, but your comprehension is that of a retarded person. Maybe you are retarded though so who knows. Anyways, any other points you want to make besides repeating that being a pedophile is not a crime?

            Here is an article that shows connection between NYT/HAITI/TRAFFICING/HRC
           </p>
           <p>
            Paraphrasing: Carlos Slim has been majority shareholder of NYT since 2015. He has donated to the Foundation and is an obscenely wealthy mexican media mogul with alleged cartel ties. Laura Silsby was caught trying to transport over 30 children out of Haiti illegally, and according to wikileaks has a long-standing relationship with HRC.
           </p>
           <p>
            Connecting the dots, Slim owns NYT, has a less than stellar reputation, has some influence within the Clinton Foundation, which has been connected to human trafficking in Haiti. It is still all circumstantial but this is enough to understand why the NYT is posting such biased articles on this topic.

            There seems to be a large group of pedophiles that enjoy hurting children, that seek out pornographic material of exessive violence and of course as is true with all child pornography; they finance the entire undertaking. Also considering the amount of child pornography videos in production, which appears to be in the tens of thousands,

            When will you people actually comprehend how big this thing is? Its literally the world elite satanic ritual. They think they're getting power from raping children. Check out Alistar Crowley, he talked about this madness and openly supported it.

              I honestly don't care what two consenting
              <strong>
               adults
              </strong>
              do. I also honestly don't care if an 18 year old and a 16 year old bang each other into exhaustion.
             </p>
             <p>
              What I do care about though is normalizing behavior in which there are clear victims. Incest is kind of a grey area if both parties involved are adults. Pedophilia always has a victim. Always.

               Technically not true. Someone may have thoughts and desires that are never known to others, but regardless it needs to be shunned because it often does involve a victim that will often suffer their whole lives.

                That's a bit of stretch there don't you think? While children born to incest relations do have a higher chance of birth defects, it doesn't mean that all will have birth defects. With that said, I do agree it is a dangerous road to take for any couple participating in the activity and I would strongly recommend protection so a pregnancy doesn't occur. The only victims in any relationship really are the people who choose to be irresponsible about it. Again, I'm talking about consenting adults.

                Yet you say the exact opposite about incest. Not every person who is into incest would act on their desires or make it known to others too.
               </p>
               <p>
                In any case, I was mainly referring to those who act on their desires in regards to pedophilia. There is always a victim. Whereas with incest, those who act on their desires isn't always clear cut if there is a victim.

            Pedophilia is not a crime, but child sex-trafficking/rape/molestation definitely is. I feel like the NYT posting of both articles is not coincidence however, and part of a broad cover-up on these topics are disinformation from higher-up in the authority chain beyond what editors find interesting to write about.
