            has posted more links to "offensive" cartoons than anyone else on Voat.
           </p>
           <p>
            He does it almost every day from what I have seen.
           </p>
           <p>
            And regarding posts that have been found not to be pedo-related, even upon request of those cartoons to be examined as possible violation of Voat's user agreement.  So the matter is well settled; cartoons posted on Voat are not pedo-related or CP, as theoldones has claimed.
           </p>
           <p>
            His further arguments have no merit because they are based on well settled questions that do not support his position.
           </p>
           <p>
            Those who regurgitate the same arguments also have no merit.
           </p>
           <p>
            These people just don't like the conclusions already made....so they try to re-argue.  Its not appropriate to do so. That's just how things work in a rational world. But they are not rational. They're crazy. Plain and simple.

              No point in it.  Your banning me merely for  asking you for your opinion of if a pic of a 95% covered-in-thick-clothing is sexually suggestive indicates that you are not wanting to actually rationally discuss issues.

            I'm always dealing with judicial arguments ... these people have no clue how to prove anything.
           </p>
           <p>
            They need to understand that proclamations are not evidence.
           </p>
           <p>
            And they refuse to accept that Voat rules do not allow for pedo related posts ; so anything posted is presumed to be not pedo-related.
           </p>
           <p>
            Its only usually people at
            <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/v/antipedosquad">
             v/antipedosquad
            </a>
            that sees stuff that is posted as being pedo-related. This is evidence that they are pedos ?
           </p>
           <p>
            What is posted on Voat is free speech, not CP or pedo-related, as the rules of Voat prohibit such postings.
           </p>
           <p>
            The anti-pedo-squad sub's members has tried, and failed, to get certain classes of cartoons to be deemed unacceptable at Voat. This is what (((they))) complain about again and again as if saying it 100x somehow changes the character of a lolli (which I have blocked and (((they))) are free to also block or ignore) from free speech to violating any Voat rule.
           </p>
           <p>
            What's a definition of crazy ?  Doing the same thing multiple times and expecting different results.

                First off, I'm the the USA .  So I would give the weight of any other country law and case law (don't quote laws w/o case law ~ with free speech issues, this is usually explained in case law) an appropriate amount of weight.

           <blockquote>
            <p>
             Throughout history men have married women younger than themselves. Only recently have feminists implemented and continually raised the age of consent with the help of Jews. This protects feminists who want to ride the cock carousel and fulfills the Jews desire to exterminate white people by narrowing potential mates for men to only washed up hags. If you support a higher AOC you are anti-white

I am disgusted at how you'd get even more excited as you lean over her, listening to her quickening breath, her girlish moans and gasps while you hasten your strokes, her sweet pants warm and moist on your face and her flat chest, shiny with a sheen of fresh sweat, rising and falling rapidly to meet yours.">

                         Been covered many times in the past (you're free to check) - "thelma" is not a person's name - it comes from somewhere else.

                         No one has guessed correctly yet. You are free to try. But given you are crazy I doubt you'll be able to rationally come the the proper answer.

              Four thousand six hundred eleven,
             </strong>
             to just those two. That doesn't even count his posts to other pedophile subs. This proves a relentless dedication to posting pedophile content. You have had your account for two years, are one of the more active goats, and he's submitted
             <strong>
              more to only those two subs

             .
            </p>
            <p>
             That should be sufficient evidence Aged is a pedophile. He doesn't just keep his pedophilia in his head either: he spams child sexualization so often on Voat it seems like it's his life's devotion. This can lead others to do harm: consider
             <a href="https://www.yourbrainonporn.com/relevant-research-and-articles-about-the-studies/porn-use-sex-addiction-studies/studies-find-escalation-and-habituation-in-porn-users-tolerance/">
              this review of over 35 scientific studies
             </a>
             that report findings consistent with significant escalation in people's porn use. For lolicon, the escalation may be to child porn. Aged also enables pedos to find each other.
            </p>
            <p>
             If we must talk law, there are speech issues that lolicon does present. If you browse
             <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legal_status_of_drawn_pornography_depicting_minors">
              this article on the legal status of drawn pornography depicting minors
             </a>
             , you'll notice it's illegal in Australia, Canada, the Philippines, South Africa, South Korea, and the United Kingdom. That's 5 of the 18 listed, or 28 percent of them. If there's loli that slips through here and there, Voat will probably be fine. If you have
             <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/u/Aged">
              thousands upon thousands of submissions
             </a>
             , in

              subverse
             </a>
             after
             <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/v/lolicon">
              subverse
             </a>
             , legal cases might be made in some of these countries this is a Voat problem and Voat might get banned there. People in these countries would then lose their freedom to speak on here, which most here wouldn't consider good.
            </p>
            <p>
             Consider also this is
             <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/v/AntiPedoSquad">
              /v/AntiPedoSquad
             </a>
             . From what I see, your comments here are similar to theoldones going to your sub
             <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/v/PieceOfShitOfTheDay">
              /v/PieceOfShitOfTheDay
             </a>
             to inform you the people who you post there as pieces of shit have done nothing illegal.
            </p>
            <p>
             Summary: it's fair to call Aged a pedo as he's a big pedo. Don't trust him around your kids.

              Throughout history men have married women younger than themselves. Only recently have feminists implemented and continually raised the age of consent with the help of Jews. This protects feminists who want to ride the cock carousel and fulfills the Jews desire to exterminate white people by narrowing potential mates for men to only washed up hags. If you support a higher AOC you are anti-white

I am disgusted at how you'd get even more excited as you lean over her, listening to her quickening breath, her girlish moans and gasps while you hasten your strokes, her sweet pants warm and moist on your face and her flat chest, shiny with a sheen of fresh sweat, rising and falling rapidly to meet yours.">

And as you lie atop her flushed body, she murmurs breathlessly, then her fingers dig into your back as she feels your cock hardening inside again.">
