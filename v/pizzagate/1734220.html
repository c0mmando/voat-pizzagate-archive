            Trump can't let it look like a vendetta.  Better to let the snivel Sessions go after her.  Trey is hot on it too and he did meet with Trump and has some kind of position/blessing?  I can't recall.  If/when the Clinton's are called to the table Trump has to look compassionate bc her devotees are going to have a come apart of major proportions.  We will best guess see riots/funded of course by Soros and company.  Trump is famous for never forgetting...

            So i was thinking the trigger point was if war starts with china or russia. The people can't allow that to happen, because if the US and those 2 are all distracted and destabilized through war operations it is checkmate for the shadow government. Then i see NATO mobilizing toward russia with US approval in todays news and i'm thinking this is it! That is not a good sign. But then i see Tillerson just visited china and now he's going to russia (article below says china president plans to go to US too in April). Things are not what they seem and Trumps body language does not look happy in recent days. Man i wish i was a US guy with militia connects.

            On Zerohedge today..
           </p>
           <p>
            "Rex Tillerson plans to skip the April 5-6 meeting of NATO foreign ministers to be present during the first US visit by China's president, and will one week later travel to Russia, "a step allies may see as putting Moscow's concerns ahead of theirs", or in other words - an intentional snub.
           </p>
           <p>
            As Reuters adds, Tillerson intends to miss what would be his first meeting in Brussels with the 28 NATO members to attend President Donald Trump's expected April 6-7 talks with Chinese President Xi Jinping at Trump's Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida."

            Have to play the game to get into position. Look at the end results and work backwards, things that were predicted by these anons are coming to fruition. I do the work backwards approach with every politician, that's how i knew Obama and Killary were bullshit, regardless of what they said the reality of the society they created was apparent and at odd with their rhetoric. He could very well have been compromised though, maybe something happened anything is possible. But that won't change the snowball effect of whats happening due to the movement he was a big driver in kicking off. Say in the scenario he does flake on his promises, the important ones with the child exploitation etc...the spark has been ignited and unless the end plan was to create violent  revolt, then their approach was incredibly stupid because once the US or another country rises up because of this, it will incite similar unrest everywhere and snowball hard. Imagine how many people will be targeting politicians and their power bases because of this. Yes they can go hide underground while everyone else kills each other off, they better move fast though once it starts because they will be targeted in that event. This is why i think people should be organizing now for that scenario and determine the trigger point, prior to revolt, that will mobilize everyone supporting this into taking it to the streets and protecting the good people, eliminating the bad ones and search teams using technology to rout out the rats underground.

            The way the MSM and every entrenched organization is going after him, that doesn't add up. I saw hillary's body language and expression as well as certain media personalities and other politicians after the election, they were scared.

            Why did Obama's justice department refuse to prosecute Epstein? It looks like Bill Clinton had a hand in getting sweet deals for his pedophile associates at the beginning of Obama's regime ( McHaney ) and at the end of Obama's regime ( Epstein ).

            contains all of Acosta's letter. Yes, they were threatened and targeted by Epstein's lawyers and I think it's pretty clear that Acosta holds a grudge. Hopefully, he will get to see justice served!

            I've been on to these Epstein cases for a while, and came to an IDEA that some of the very high level business deals might be SEALED WITH VIDEOS ON CHILD RAPE, meaning that either/both parties has one of those saved from another party to seal an agreement of trust, and neither party could deliver that forward without going down himself too. We MIGHT be looking at such case between Epstein/Clinton and/or Epstein/Trump.
           </p>
           <p>
            Currently, there are ongoing court hearings on both how the sweetheart deal was made and on new abuse cases. The problem in the sweetheart deal was that not all the victims were informed well enough before closing the deal, and another problem was that the rights of new victims to make a case might have been reduced. I guess we're looking at years long processes, few lawyers making an awful pile of money while even more children might suffer.

             It's also possible that Trump was lured into such deal by Epstein, and gained a moral victory later in his life starting to work for a better world in the limits he has. But these are all theories. We can't really know who's bad and who's good, and from the investigative point of view we just have to accept the famous fact:
            </p>
            <ul>
             <li>
              Nobody's guilty until proven guilty
             </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
             In the meanwhile I'm keeping all the theories under my investigative eyes, bring out any possible new theories to be confirmed, not accusing anyone but not safeguarding any party either. I'm using pure logic on this.

              (This nation is at a big time crossroads right now and things are about to change one way or other ... getting anxious ... other things too on my mind but can't mention it here ... well the economic situation is also unsustainable.)

              This is def a possibility ... I would lean towards entrapment, some people just aren't into kids, sexually. That is not to say at all that Trump could not have been tempted by an underage young girl that was to his liking/preference, tall and model-like, but I'm talking 17 or 18 years old (think a youngish Brooke Shields). We'll see what happens. Comey is a dirtbag btw, had to get that in there.

             That's a great and plausible theory, really. But I seriously doubt there's something like that on Trump, he would not have fought so tenaciously, and put himself and family through this mess.
            </p>
            <p>
             I believe he's a true patriot. Trump is not the same man he was just a year or two ago.
            </p>
            <p>
             I see some on the forum beginning to doubt the man. It's a bit deflating, and would be to POTUS himself. Trump is doing rallies again (one tonight even I think), as he needs the people, and draws strength and energy from the people, to keep going.
            </p>
            <p>
             If Trump is dirty, this Bible verse would not be applicable to him, and I think that it obviously is.

            <p>
             Edit: In "righteous" I simply mean a clear conscience in matters we're speaking of.

              Yeah i mostly follow your guys' links and rationale on this, but i would assume they would have used it already if they had dirt on him. The fact they only came up with the russian dossier tells me they don't have much, and even if they assumed they would get in why didn't they use it after they lost? But i'll wait and see and keep checking your guys info on it, unsure too but i have a hard time wrapping my head around the idea they haven't used their pedo dirt if they had it.

              I'm not up on bible quotes.  Approaching events from a different perspective/archetypes and how mass thought creates archetypes to represent ideas being explored.  Trump has Leo rising (the public persona), Leo the Lion/so you might be on to something here.

               “Soon after the catalyst, a national election will produce a sweeping political realignment, as one faction or coalition capitalizes on a new public demand for decisive action. Republicans, Democrats, or perhaps a new party will decisively win the long partisan tug of war. This new regime will enthrone itself for the duration of the Crisis. Regardless of its ideology, that new leadership will assert public authority and demand private sacrifice. Where leaders had once been inclined to alleviate societal pressures, they will now aggravate them to command the nation’s attention. The regeneracy will be solidly under way.” – Strauss &amp; Howe – The Fourth Turning - 1997

                 Trump is the "Gray Champion"! (Sorry to spam you goodnight :)
                </p>
                <p>
                 “Who was this Gray Champion?” Nathaniel Hawthorne asked near the end of this story in his Twice-Told Tales. No one knew, except that he had once been among the fire-hearted young Puritans who had first settled New England more than a half century earlier. Later that evening, just before the old priest-warrior disappeared, the townspeople saw him embracing the 85-year-old Simon Bradstreet, a kindred spirit and one of the few original Puritans still alive. **Would the Gray Champion ever return? “I have heard,” added Hawthorne, “that whenever the descendants of the Puritans are to show the spirit of their sires, the old man appears again.” **
