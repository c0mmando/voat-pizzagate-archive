            I support this 100%. I've read everything so far on your new subverse, and will read it again tomorrow. I have no journalistic skill, and I recognize that personal limitation. So, I'll be watching and waiting for a while before commenting there, until I get the gist of what info fits and follows the rules, and what doesn't. I hope everyone will pay attention to those rules, and that
            <strong>
             WE ALL
            </strong>
            will be vigilant, and ultimately successful at keeping things organized there.
           </p>
           <p>
            If this works for the (huge, wide) topic, TRAFFICKING, using sub-categories, maybe it could serve as a future model/template for new, specific subverses on non-journalistic-based discussion on very specific topics. Like THIS commendable effort, that has slipped away.

            in this new subverse - using two examples, both about art, but hopefully they'll apply to other interests:

             <strong>
              Q1)
             </strong>
             Would this sub be appropriate to add to
             <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/v/pizzagatejournalism">
              /v/pizzagatejournalism
             </a>
             , as it stands, under "M2 Money Laundering?" And if so, is it only appropriate because it references/links to
             <strong>
              news
             </strong>
             articles?

             <strong>
              Q2)
             </strong>
             I made a comment on that sub, noting
             <em>
              Maria Marshall's President Bill Clinton was purchased by Bill and Ruth True
             </em>
             , citing/linking a few media articles, with factual info about the Trues, that seemed to ME, related to money laundering, but not suggested as such, in those linked news articles. If my "suspicions" are backed up, in my own mind, by the linked news articles, but not IN those articles, is this info legit for commenting on
             <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/v/pizzagatejournalism">
              v/pizzagatejournalism
             </a>
             /?
            </p>
           </blockquote>
           <p>
            Then, this last small question: If existing
            <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/v/Pizzagate">
             v/Pizzagate
            </a>
            submissions fit the rules, should direct links to those subs just be commented in the appropriate category - the linked title of the sub (if it's descriptive) being sufficient on it's own, as the comment, or should a description be added?
           </p>
           <p>
            I hope my questions aren't annoying, tedious... that I'm missing something that should have already given me the answers. I really want this to work, and to provide much-needed organization, here on anything voat - pizzagate.

             q1 quite potentially, q2 not in this form. I'd like you to post both q1 and q2 as a new discussion there, as they both include laundering related claims on persons related to pizzagate, so they only require some basic fact checking. Discussions in the sub are a great place for fact checking, and I'm happy to help on that.

            To get any traffic, I think you're going to need a subverse link under Pizzagate Subverse Network on the right side of the page, otherwise your sub will probably drift off into oblivion. I would lobby hard with PG mods for a listing there along with
            <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/v/Askpizzagate">
             /v/Askpizzagate

              you know what, I was going to ignore you, but you are being civil - more civil than wecanhelp who is actually a charmless vinegar spitting mod here, so why not, I'll give you an answer at least.  I'm not going to try to prove some intricate and entire case to you, but if you'd like I'll give you a link to an article from 2004 that opened my mind to this problem long before recent events.

              This is the journalist who wrote the screenplay
              <em>
               Kill The Messenger
              </em>
              about Gary Webb's investigation into CIA drug running.  The elite "blackmail" element is missing in this particular article, for reasons of personal safety I would assume. (Find an article detailing Epstein's operation if you want details on that, but I presume you are familiar.)
             </p>
             <p>
              Your real problem isn't slobs like us that only pass along what these guys sweat blood to uncover - your problem is that there are always going to be a high order of truth finders and truth speakers - like Hastings, Greenwald, Snowdon, Webb, Taibbi, Landesman and others.
             </p>
             <p>
              And even if you could stomp out every last one, the truth will still reform itself in the mouth of a new brilliant mind, and carry forward.   You'd be better off studying the I Ching than wasting your time with us.  You are too stubborn to "learn" anything here, but the I Ching - and the element of constant change - is relentless.  Start thinking about going with the flow, because the pyramid is flipping.

            I'd like you to find a reliable news post on high profile corruption, maybe related to border patrol, logistics, catastrophy areas, and post it to the new subverse. We're here to help each other.
           </p>
           <p>
            Maybe Jeffrey Epstein would be a piece you're looking for - very high profile, very convicted pedophile. I'm looking for a wider perspective and spreading the awareness. Comments here are meaningless for that. I hope I got you convinced anyway, all the best.

            That's an indicator, which is strong enough evidence to point that the problem exists in a high level, which is strong enough pointer to demand a case. But the first thing to do is push the awareness. This way the public demand will be higher, forcing the case. Before awareness, the hideout and crimes continues even that some people know about that.
           </p>
           <p>
            The media is full of more indicators, which should be found and made global. Corruption is one of the keys to open this all up.

            Sure. Trafficking children in such large scale it's currently happening would be impossible without high profile corruption involved. This is my evidence #1. You're welcome to join helping those kids, but not welcome to shill. Think about your true feelings.
