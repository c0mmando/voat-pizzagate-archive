<p>It\'s basically a Hollywood gossip blog where he talks about actor rumors, but doesn\'t say their names (called a \'Blind Item\' post) -- Later in time he sometimes reveals the names after the rumors have been somewhat public (called a \'Blind Items Revealed\' post).</p>
<p>Here\'s a horrifying blind item he just wrote:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Back in the mid-80\'s was peak child molesting time in Hollywood. There was no internet. There were very very few mobile phones. Children came to the set where they were left alone by their parents. For the next 8 hours they were subject to every kind of horrible thing you can imagine. Drugs were commonplace. They were used to try and get the kids to not be so hysterical when being assaulted.</em></p>
<p><em>Producers loved casting shows with kids and tweens. If someone pitched a show that involved a handful of tweens with a dozen tween extras per week, it would get a green light. Even if the show was going to suck, and everyone knew it was going to suck, if you got the right pedo at a studio he would say yes just to come for the casting and taping of the pilot. As sad as it is to say, there were a lot of parents who told their kids to go off with the nice man in the suit and do what he says. It was a sick sick time.</em></p>
<p><em>It was just past the mid 80\'s when a producer came up with the idea of a tween show that not only would feature a rotating cast of extras, but would make the studio a bunch of money because they would film quickly and not hire any adults. Further, the faster they filmed, the more time they would have to molest all the kids that would be hanging around.</em></p>
<p><em>From the first day, it was the worst place on earth if you were a kid. The studio where the show was filmed also had several other shows being filmed there, most of which featured lots of children. Executives would drive over to Hollywood right before lunch and would stay at the studio for several hours each day.</em></p>
<p><em>Anyway, on this particular show, there was a special guest star. A very special guest star. Still not a tween, everyone knew who she was. Executives flocked to the studio that day to see her. She was first molested when she was 5 or 6 and had continued to be molested throughout her hit movies and also on a previous show.</em></p>
<p><em>One of the stars of the show who has spent her life bouncing in and out of rehab because of what she saw, and who was actually nominated for awards from the show, described the atmosphere that day.</em></p>
<p><em>&quot;A bunch of fucking pigs. I had just turned 12 or 13. I was the same age as the actress coming in. Maybe a little older. We had been shooting for months and I was old news. They knew I would do what they wanted, but they always wanted someone new. This was someone new and someone they all knew. They had it set up like a peep show almost. She had finished shooting that morning and they brought her out on a stage. The stage was used most of the time for a game show that was taped there. That game show is still on today. I can\'t watch it knowing what happened to her there. They brought her out and the front four rows of this theatre were filled with guys who were already rubbing themselves. The girl was wearing a bikini. The show took place around a beach just so they could make these girls wear next to nothing. They had her walk around under the lights. The lights were focused on her and she couldn\'t really see out to the audience. She was squinting. It must have been blinding for her. They had her walk back and forth. Then they had her start dancing. All of these guys were doing what another star at that same studio got busted for. This went on for about 20 minutes. Then three of the guys took her to a different area of the studio.&quot;</em></p>
<p><em>The actress didn\'t see what happened, but about 45 minutes later, one of those three guys came running out and needed a set medic. Apparently they had inserted something inside the girl and things were bad. The medic came and the ambulance came. The parents of the girl were told some crap story. That crap story ended up killing the girl because the parents believed the executives. Two weeks later, the show finished shooting six episodes all at once and then everyone was sent on their way forever. No one wanted the kids around or any witnesses to what happened.</em></p>

<p>In a follow-up to the above blind item post, he added this blind item post later in the day:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>A side note to the big blind earlier today. The actress who witnessed a lot of what was going on also worked with this A-/B+ list mostly movie actor who is known for some other things besides acting. They were on a show together and she said he is as f</em><em>ked up as any of the executives that showed up at that studio every day to watch and molest the actors.</em></p>

<p>I recommend people visit the source page and look at the comment section for these posts as well. People are putting 2 and 2 together, figuring out who he\'s talking about.</p>',

             It was in the 80s. I'm thinking Rocky road and the actress who died from these molesters was Heather o rourke (I'm spelling the last name wrong but she is the little girl in poltergeist who died from her organs exploding with a bowel movement)

               I have NEVER seen or read this, yet you holly censorship mod freaks remove this so the rest of us remained ignorant. Unlike you, this is NEW to me and we are frustrated by CENSORSHIP, period.

              <p>
               Yet you help us remain ignorant because YOU FUCKS control the LONG term narrative and call it virtue.

              <p>
               You fucks are control freaks who suppress info for desperately needed NEWBIES. Which should be your goal, not the clueless.

               You fucks are cherry picking the info that NEWBIES require to take baby steps.

                 Think long term. Look the fool just to help the fence sitters to look around with ACTIVE comments.
Most is bullshit, yet removing the bullshit is have abuse of power controls the narrative.

              You spelled it right. Heather O'Rourke.
Now I wish I remained ignorant.
The fact this child had obvious trauma at the genital/anal area and the Medical personnel did NOT report rape is why pedophilia continues unabated.

               That's what makes me question what hospital and what doctor she saw. Did the people on set send the mother that way? Orrrr? Because there's protocol to follow when a child is showing very obvious signs of trauma. She was also around drew Barrymore around that time and shown sitting on Steven Spielbergs lap. Now a lot of people say drew did drugs because her mom but kids and adults tend to do drugs long term due to trauma. The blog mentions an a Lister, drew must of just wrapped filming on E.t. which would mean she is the other girl they talk about being passed around from the age difference of 5. Ugh I feel sick.

              This poor child died in agony so great I am sure death was a relief. The pain of a bowel obstruction is like no other. I am sure a special place in hell awaits her murderers...may they experience her pain forever more....
