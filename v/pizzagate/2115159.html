            John Podesta graduated from Land Tech High School in 1967 in Chicago at 18 or so and it says on his page that he completed college in 1971 in the same state of Illinois. That doesn’t mean he couldn’t have traveled around though. The timeline appears to be very consistent. Almost fits like a glove. During his time in college he helped Eugene McCarthy’s candidacy to the Democratic Party.  Now here is a timeline that would have put McCarthy and the Podesta brothers in the Washington D.C. area at the time of Cathy’s murder. Just to note it is only a 30-40 minute drive from D.C. to Baltimore.
            <br/>
            November 2nd 1969 Senator McCarthy giving a press conference in Washington D.C.
            <br/>
            November 7th 1969 Sister Cathy Cesnik ‘disappeared’.   I have already been told to stop by a user on Reddit using what appears to be a throwaway account:   From the pig man...Cute vid.  You ca stop now.  Then also the description of the Evil Twin Skippy....“A thin, stern-looking man in photographs, Mr. Podesta was given the name the Evil Twin"  NOW there are other mentions in the released JP emails that mention his unleashing Skippy and how others want him to keep him at bay.  The article in True Earth should be read by everyone before they make up their minds.

I, too must go on record. Starting in 1988, I've been getting a lot of money from the U.S. Office of Naval Research.

            We still have not established whether JP is connected to this or not.  What is the consensus?  I say there is a good possibility.  Did he start dabbling in this type of crime while living just a short distance from Baltimore?  I think Nancy Pelosi's father was connected to the Mafia there.  Also JP was sure to have hung out with priests since he was studying to be a Jesuit priest himself.  Is this what they had on him to Brownstone him?  Could be.

             I have been lurking for quite some time now and while always feeling the need to comment, I have not. Reason being is someone usually beats me to the punch, so to speak, with obvious outrage or providing various links to corroborate the info. Today I feel the need to post a link with possible information that suggests that JP is,  in fact, tied to Sister Cesnik's murder. I have included the link for further review. While this website is not what would be labeled at main stream media, it is very informative and very well laid out with links to his own research. Thank you for your time.

                If you are a survivor or you have lost someone in your family I wish you peace.  I was sure I added another comment, but now I cannot find it.  Hmm.  I will go back and see if I can regroup and write it up again.  I really think this has some merit and should be pushed in Baltimore but with the Mafia and so many corrupt people it will be hard to push forward.
