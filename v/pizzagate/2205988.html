<p>Many believe the two e-fits released in the search for the Madeline McCann abductor(s) bear more than a passing resemblance to <strong>John &amp; Tony Podesta</strong>: <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-24513267">http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-24513267</a></p>

<li>
<p>The two e-fits were <strong>commissioned in 2008</strong> (but <strong>not</strong> released until <strong>2013</strong>) by a fraudulent Irish, ex-MI5/GCHQ detective <strong>KEVIN HALLIGEN</strong> (his antics worthy of a separate thread alone), whose company, <strong>Oakley International</strong> was hired by the McCann\'s to look into the case of missing Madeline. His associate, another ex-M15 spy, <strong>Henri Exton</strong>, produced the actual e-fits: <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/2013/10/27/madeleine-mccann-kate-gerry-mi5_n_4167645.html">http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/2013/10/27/madeleine-mccann-kate-gerry-mi5_n_4167645.html</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Oakley International</strong> was based out of <strong>2550 M Street, NW, Washington, DC</strong>. This address is also the office of <strong>Patton Boggs</strong>, Washington\'s most politically-connected law firm and lobbyist organization. When <strong>Kevin Halligen</strong> first moved to DC in 2005, he hired <strong>Patton Boggs</strong> to help set up his new business.

</li>
</ul>
<p>It would be accurate to say through his <strong>close connection</strong> with <strong>Patton Boggs</strong>, <strong>Kevin Halligen</strong> was more than familiar with <strong>The Podesta Group</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Tony Podesta</strong> on <strong>Tommy Boggs</strong> of <strong>Patton Boggs</strong>: &quot;He’s a brilliant guy who invented what a lot of us do.&quot; <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/patton-boggs-to-merge-with-squire-sanders/2014/05/23/1981b1b8-e2ab-11e3-9743-bb9b59cde7b9_story.html?utm_term=.1c1e95f35458">https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/patton-boggs-to-merge-with-squire-sanders/2014/05/23/1981b1b8-e2ab-11e3-9743-bb9b59cde7b9_story.html?utm_term=.1c1e95f35458</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Nick Allard</strong>, <strong>Co-Chair, Patton Boggs</strong> on <strong>Tony Podesta</strong>: &quot;Tony and his group are the right people at the right time in the right place...Tom Boggs invented the lawyer-lobbyist model and <strong>Tony perfected it</strong>. They are probably the two giants of the modern practice. There is no one else in the same zip code.&quot; <a href="http://thehill.com/business-a-lobbying/72683-lobbyist-tony-podesta-flies-high-in-obama-era">http://thehill.com/business-a-lobbying/72683-lobbyist-tony-podesta-flies-high-in-obama-era</a> </p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>In 2008, (the year that the McCann \'Podesta-like\' e-fits were created, and one year after Maddie disappeared + the Obama Administration came into effect), <strong>The Podesta Group\'s profits jumped from $10mm to $30mm.</strong> <a href="http://www.alternet.org/story/156279/the_9_most_loathsome_lobbyists_in_washington">http://www.alternet.org/story/156279/the_9_most_loathsome_lobbyists_in_washington</a></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Why did <strong>Kevin Halligen</strong> commission the e-fits in 2008? Why did a random Irish eye witness, <strong>Martin Smith<strong>, (</strong>remember; Kevin Halligen is also Irish</strong>) come out of nowhere to \'suddenly remember\' months after the disappearance, that he saw a mystery man near the McCann\'s apartment, that, as per the e-fits, looked to be \'Podesta like\'. He also stated that the man kept his heads down, so how could Smith have generated <strong>a carbon copy visual of the Podesta Brothers</strong>? Why did Martin Smith then, just as quickly withdraw his testimony? That being the case, <strong>why were the Podesta-like e-fits still used in the BBC Crimewatch TV \'Maddie Special\', televised in October, 2013</strong>?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In <strong>2013</strong>, Patton Boggs <strong>“…underwent layoffs and partner exits in 2013 amid a 12% drop in revenue, and entered merger talks with Squire Sanders.”</strong> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Squire_Patton_Boggs">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Squire_Patton_Boggs</a></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>What dirt do <strong>Kevin Halligen</strong> and <strong>Patton Boggs</strong> have on <strong>The Podesta Group</strong> and/or <strong>the whereabouts of the Podesta brothers in May, 2007 (when MM disappeared)</strong>? Why did <strong>Kevin Halligen</strong>, hired by the McCann\'s to investigate their daughter\'s disappearance, produce e-fits closely resembling (beyond reasonable doubt) his client\'s (Patton Boggs) biggest rivals?</p>
<p><strong>Who</strong> persuaded - and why - <strong>Gerry and Kate McCann</strong> to put their faith in (<strong>and pay $500k</strong> to) a random Washington DC-based \'detective\' <strong>(Kevin Halligen)</strong> who mysteriously reached out to them telling them he could find their daughter? <strong>Was Halligen actually bribing Gerry and Kate over something?</strong> Halligen\'s\'s charm skills had already persuaded Andre Hollis, a former US Drug enforcement agency official, to write out an $80,000 cheque to Halliday\'s company Oakley, in return for a ten per cent share-holding (never received.) <a href="https://cryptome.org/0001/henri-exton.htm">https://cryptome.org/0001/henri-exton.htm</a> Was Hollis being \'bribed\' over something too? I digress...</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Why</strong>, in <strong>March 2004</strong>, was <strong>Kevin Halligen</strong> handed a <strong>rare US Department of Defense Security Pass?</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>AND last but not least <strong>WHY</strong> was <strong>Gerry McCann</strong> pictured laughing and joking his way around <strong>Washington DC</strong>, home of <strong>Podesta and PizzaGate</strong>, in <strong>JULY 2007</strong> (less than three months after Maddie disappeared), lobbying statesmen on child trafficking, kissing Laura Bush\'s dog, and generally enjoying the limelight? <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-471365/After-long-months-daughter--McCanns.8html">http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-471365/After-long-months-daughter--McCanns.8html</a></p>

           What dirt do
           <strong>
            Kevin Halligen
           </strong>
           and
           <strong>
            Patton Boggs
           </strong>
           have on
           <strong>
            The Podesta Group
           </strong>
           and/or
           <strong>
            the whereabouts of the Podesta brothers in May, 2007 (when MM disappeared)
           </strong>
           ? Why did
           <strong>
            Kevin Halligen
           </strong>
           , hired by the McCann's to investigate their daughter's disappearance, produce e-fits closely resembling (beyond reasonable doubt) his client's (Patton Boggs) biggest rivals?
          </p>
          <p>
           <strong>
            Who
           </strong>
           persuaded - and why -
           <strong>
            Gerry and Kate McCann
           </strong>
           to put their faith in (
           <strong>
            and pay $500k
           </strong>
           to) a random Washington DC-based 'detective'
           <strong>
            (Kevin Halligen)
           </strong>
           who mysteriously reached out to them telling them he could find their daughter?
           <strong>
            Was Halligen actually bribing Gerry and Kate over something?
           </strong>
           Halligen's's charm skills had already persuaded Andre Hollis, a former US Drug enforcement agency official, to write out an $80,000 cheque to Halliday's company Oakley, in return for a ten per cent share-holding (never received.)

            https://cryptome.org/0001/henri-exton.htm
           </a>
           Was Hollis being 'bribed' over something too? I digress...

            Gerry and Kate rented Maddie to the Podestas then they took her without paying full price for her. The parents covered up everything and most likely Maddie was killed but mom and dad knew exactly who took her and where she was disposed of.

            I saw this this morning and decided to look at the efit. I made a meme out of it. Then someone accused me of posting fake pictures. I went to the website for findmadeleine.com and sent an email to the email address listed on the efit. The responses I got were on this post:
            <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/v/pizzagate/2207423/10872459">
             https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/2207423/10872459
            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            alphabravo on that thread is accusing me of bribing pedophiles. Also, the email address is being spoofed or something, and I do not know from which point, whether it's from Operation Grange or somewhere between my computer and them. I'm going to guess it's my emails that are being intercepted and not theirs.
           </p>
           <p>
            Based on a few other experiences I have had in trying to make contact with the FBI and law enforcement I am going to state that if anyone has any information to share, if you are sending it over your computer, you need to send a copy to Wikileaks from a secure browser and VPN. The deep state seems to be intercepting our reports and trashing them, considering that the majority of the law enforcement people I talk to had no record of the prior reports I had made, or the phone calls I made either. Somebody somewhere is f$$$$ lying about how high up and how far down this whole thing goes.
