            It may seem a little after-the-fact but...
           </p>
           <p>
            CrimeSceneTapegate:
           </p>
           <p>
            Quite awhile a ago, a Youtuber submitted an FOIA request to the DC police to find out whether they were investigating the pedo angle of CPP.   Long story short, the paperwork he received, as well as indicated in a phone call, they were not.
           </p>
           <p>
            What I don't think anyone has yet done is create a FOIA request for the police report on the shooting itself.
           </p>
           <p>
            There is a ton of information about what supposedly happened  that day, when and where  why and by whom. who called it in? What was the exact timeline, is there mention of a shot to a computer and is there the required diagram of it?  Did they note that the street camera had been turned away and was turned back again a day later?  Did they look at that tape at all? Was it booked into evidence? How closely would the actual police report be to the facts we know.  My guess is that there would PLENTY of inconsistencies.
           </p>
           <p>
            The yellow crime scene tape has always bugged me. There are at least two pics showing the yellow tape, ostensibly cordoning off "an area."
           </p>

            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            In the first one, the tape is visible AS the swat team is seen walking into (storming? haha) CPP to confront the shooter - or immediately after he had walked out to the intersection with his hands raised?
           </p>
           <p>
            In front of the tape in the second photo is a female officer with her gun drawn. I understand that there was zero resistance and that the whole thing was over within minutes. It was not something involving a standoff.
           </p>
           <p>
            Allegedly, the call came in, and within about a minute, cop cars screamed up to CPP, officers leapt out of the their squad cars with weapons drawn. The swat guys marched in and grabbed Edgar - or somehow they didn't and he walked right past them out into the intersection with his hands raised. Or they marched in instantly to secure the place, after he walked out. No matter what the scenario, he was immediately taken into custody.   That we know.
           </p>
           <p>
            Given the micro window of time within which all of this happened, when did anyone have time to string up crime scene tape all over the place and why would they do it when  they'd have to get that close to the live/active shooting that was IN progress? The answer is, they wouldn't.
           </p>
           <p>
            There are many other things that would be fascinating to check against that report. Hope there's someone here interested enough in this to go for it -- assuming no one yet has and somehow I missed it. I'd do it myself but I'm working on other things now.
           </p>
           <p>
            One other thing. Do any of the pics with Edgar match exactly with any intersection near CPP. If so and it was staged , wouldn't the video tape on the street camera show it  -- because it happened there before the camera was turned down?   Maybe there is no match.
           </p>
           <p>
            Anyway, I hope someone goes for it!

            Posting this again but it probably deserves to be.  Judge Jackson, despite not seeming to hear too many cases, was also assigned to Judicial Watch's Osama bin Laden porn stash case.  That's the case where the CIA is now claiming that Osama bin Laden's porn stash may not even exist but if it does they are still investigating it so it's classified.  The CIA is the one who claimed the porn stash existed in the first place.  It was all over the news.  I don't care whether his porn stash exists or not but these are the same clowns that said Osama bin Laden read Noam Chomsky and Mike Ruppert and had a copy of Bev Harris's Black Box Voting.
           </p>
           <p>
            Judge Jackson seems to attract the offbeat national security cases that may be more than they seem at first glance.  She was also one of Obama's SCOTUS short listers slated to possibly fill Scalia's vacant seat.  Maybe none of this would be suspicious if Scalia hadn't had a pillow over his face or if IMDB-listed pizzagate investigator Welch hadn't shot a computer hard drive or if Osama bin Laden's four wives didn't negate his need for a porn stash.  Something seems fishy here.

            I noticed that Judge Brown.  Or is it Ketanji.  Whatever it is - only had about 5 cases for a whole month.  I don't know what #judgelife is like, but that sounds like the job for me.
