            Right on cue the Deep State will attempt another self destructive false flag. I know people are worried but please don't be. Yes I highly suspect they'll try another False Flag but every one of them so far have blown up in their face why should this one be any different?

            A couple of weeks ago it was Steve Scalise whose shooting they hoped would keep Senators and House Reps quiet. It had the opposite effect I'm gathering. Far from scaring Senators and House Reps they're now pissed off someone's trying to kill them.
           </p>
           <p>
            This reminds me of The Battle of Britain when just before Adolf Hitler had brought England to its knees by bombing its air bases and radar installations a lone RAF night bomber mistakenly dropped its ordnance on Berlin. Hitler became enraged and immediately stopped all bombing of airfields and radar stations and went after London and other British cities.
           </p>
           <p>
            It seemed horrible at the time but it gave the RAF time to repair their airbases and radar stations while taking delivery of new Spitfires and pilots. After only a couple of months the RAF recovered and got the upper hand on the Luftwaffe. The rest is History.

             The presence of two of the biggest shills here is more proof that this is indeed a good lead. Keep an eye open guys. How much are you two losers getting paid for your shill posts?

              You're referring to the O'Keefe video?  Such an honest source.  No, I'm ignoring it doesn't matter what that guy who doesn't cover political or intelligence issues says.  It doesn't matter what anyone an CNN says.   Law Enforcement is turning up more and more in this case and they are continually finding things related to the campaign and to White House officials.

              Because no one in the White House believes it's false.
             </p>
             <p>
              Right now we now that hacked information was delivered to a GOP operative in Florida and used in Congressional races down there.  Now we have a  longterm GOP moneyman and operative on the record as trying to get Russian Hackers to hack Clinton's server and deliver her emails.
             </p>
             <p>
              When he reached out to a computer security expert, he was warned that he might be dealing with the Russian intelligence services and thus could be in legal jeopardy.  He didn't care.  There's two witness who said this operative, Peter Smith, said he that was close to Michael Flynn and Michael Flynn Jr and implied the Trump campaign supported him in this effort.   Smith denied this to the WSJ and said he was acting independently.
             </p>
             <p>
              A second story came out that said that as Smith was trying to recruit people to work on this project,
              <a href="https://www.vox.com/2017/6/29/15896582/trump-russia-michael-flynn-wsj">
               he named several Trump advisors:
              </a>
             </p>
             <blockquote>
              <p>
               Wall Street Journal revealed that in a document Smith distributed while he was trying to recruit for his effort, he named the Trump campaign as one of four groups involved somehow, and specifically listed the names of several Trump advisers including Flynn, Steve Bannon, and Kellyanne Conway.
              </p>
              <p>
               Bannon and Conway strongly denied being involved with Smith’s effort in any way. Flynn, however, did not respond to Harris’s requests for comment.
              </p>
             </blockquote>
             <p>
              He even created a company to handle this project and specifically mentioned he was doing it so the "Campaign" wouldn't be seen paying the people on the project. He listed the following Team Trump members as being part of the project :Steve Bannon, Kellyanne Conway, Sam Clovis, Lt. Gen. Flynn and Lisa Nelson.
             </p>
             <blockquote>
              <p>
               Then, a few weeks into my interactions with Smith, he sent me a document, ostensibly a cover page for a dossier of opposition research to be compiled by Smith’s group, and which purported to clear up who was involved. The document was entitled “A Demonstrative Pedagogical Summary to be Developed and Released Prior to November 8, 2016,” and dated September 7. It detailed a company Smith and his colleagues had set up as a vehicle to conduct the research: “KLS Research”, set up as a Delaware LLC “to avoid campaign reporting,” and listing four groups who were involved in one way or another.
              </p>
              <p>
               The first group, entitled “Trump Campaign (in coordination to the extent permitted as an independent expenditure)” listed a number of senior campaign officials: Steve Bannon, Kellyanne Conway, Sam Clovis, Lt. Gen. Flynn and Lisa Nelson.
              </p>
              <p>
               The largest group named a number of “independent groups / organizations / individuals / resources to be deployed.” My name appears on this list. At the time, I didn’t recognize most of the others; however, several made headlines in the weeks immediately prior to the election.
              </p>
             </blockquote>
             <p>
              Just learned that Peter Smith contacted the reporter and offered to give an interview.  He hoped to do more reporting and more interviews with Smith, but Smith died 10 days.   He has no evidence of foul play, but he also has not been able to get any info on the cause of death.

                 That doesn't matter anymore. The "Russian Hooker Golden Shower" story severely damaged any credibility Deep State "reliable" sources have. How much credibility will the Deep State have if we find out Seth Rich wasn't killed?  Also as Bill Clinton infamously

                  proved
                 </a>
                 there's a big difference between impeach and indict.
                </p>
                <p>
                 They'll never get to indict because the Deep State is struggling even to impeach. The Steve Scalise shooting pissed off every Senator and Representative down in DC. Whether the Scalise shooting was a False Flag or not doesn't matter. And I can just hear you smirking right now down in DC thinking to yourself "If he only lived down here he'd understand every Democratic Senator's schadenfrued at seeing a Republican shot." Or whatever you think it will always be from the perspective of the seasoned and snickering DC insider. But that runs both ways AreWeSure. I'm sitting here in my house snickering to myself if AreWeSure just lived among the Deplorables he'd understand what I'm about to explain to you.
                </p>
                <p>
                 And that is just the possibility of intimidation is enough to unite everyone in Congress against the Deep State. They were already a tiny bit pissed at the possibility Beranton Whisenant was killed to stifle an investigation into
                 <s>
                  Deep Wasserman Schitz
                 </s>
                 diplomatic passports . Ditto for the radioactive Maersk Memphis story. Whether it was real or not put the possibility of a Dirty Bomb in the conscience of at least 100,000,000 American adults living on the Eastern Seaboard of the United States. Get it? Do I have to break out the crayons?
                </p>
                <p>
                 Ok fine I will. If this whole Peter Smith "Hail Mary" ever makes it to an impeachment hearing in Congress which I highly doubt but just for arguments sake I'll concede. If that Hail Mary ever gets to Congress any of this "evidence" won't be taken seriously to begin with. When mixed with the suspicion the Deep State is trying to intimidate through murder and a possible Dirty Bomb any vote to impeach will lose by a country mile. The Deep State desperation will scare people into thinking if it's bad now what if they REALLY get desperate.
                </p>
                <p>
                 Make sense now? Just the thought of intimidation can easily backfire. I wrote about this
                 <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/v/pizzagate/1972898/9717552">
                  just yesterday
                 </a>
                 because the Deep State keeps making the same mistake. My comment was to point out a Historical parallel involving bombing campaigns during WWII. Both the English and the Nazis thought bombing civilians would intimidate them into surrendering. It had the opposite effect. It enraged the civilians into working twice as hard. That's what lead to victory.in the Battle of Britain. And ironically what lead to German industrial output INCREASING every year of the war despite a massive bombing campaign that went on day and night.
                </p>
                <p>
                 The Deep State is their own worst enemy. Just when they start to get a leg up they'll pull another poorly thought out move guaranteed to backfire. It's one step forward two steps back.

                 to green light/red light any of these Gems the Deep State thinks up. You've got to remember unlike you I actually AM a poor person. I actually only have ONE not TWO working toilets despite the fact I had two when I moved in because when you're poor and live paycheck to paycheck you learn to live with the bare minimum. In the case of the toilet I just have to walk a little farther to go to the bathroom. Ain't no big deal.

               This story has been debunked. Search cernovich timeline on "WSJ" ...

               ... apparently, the source material is inconsistent with the story as published by the WSJ. Even Smith's deadbed tweets warn against blaming the Russians:

                Yes, everything I said there is evidence for.
               </p>
               <p>
                Peter Smith went on the record said he was trying to work with Russian Hackers to get Clintons emails.   What is disputed is whether he was working with the campaign on this effort.  He says no.  Two witnesses say yes.  There also appear to documents Smith created that implies he was working with the campaign.    On the other side of the equation, there are intel intercepts of Russian hackers talking about the fact that some American was looking for Clinton's emails.
               </p>
               <p>
                Smith could have been working independently and never told anyone different.        He could have been lying about working with the Trump campaign.     Or he could have been working the Trump campaign.  This is the beginning of this story.
               </p>
               <p>
                But this long time GOP operative admitted he was attempting to pay Russian Hackers to get access to Hillary Clinton's emails because he hoped to use them to affect the election.
               </p>
               <p>
                Trump has now admitted the fact that Russians tried to interfere in this election and right wing media is pushing the talking point of "if there was collusion, it's not illegal."

            Update: Seems /pol has been aware of this situation since 4pm PST. Some chatter about how "Trump's tweets are gonna get someone killed".
           </p>
           <p>
            Given our foes MO to cryptically foreshadow their actions ahead of time and /pol's findings, its extremely likely this false flag is indeed real. Stay safe, stay vigilant, try to either blocl it, or damage control it.

              The aurora Colorado theater shooting was probably a false flag. The dark knight was playing during it. It's very interesting case with lots of evidence worth looking into if you haven't.

             It says either an attack on Alefantis or a Podesta Brother.  JP has been extremely mouthy on Twitter.  Maybe they will say he antagonized Trump....IDK, but this is scary stuff.  Real Scary.

            "Fake News" is one of the Deep State's primary weapons used against US and our investigation."
           </p>
           <p>
            What "INVESTIGATION?!"  This is NOT an "investigation."  Your attempt to self-aggrandize armchair research is a slap in the face to REAL investigators everywhere.
           </p>

            There is no "Trump-vs-'deep state" war going on.  That is a psy-op.

           <p>
            Check this out.  Why are Ivanka, Jared, and many Trumpster "conservatives" partying with George Soros?

              LOL!!  "Fake news" has been around for DECADES.
             </p>
             <p>
              Haven't you ever seen or read 1984?  I know fake news stories -- made up out of whole cloth -- have been implanted in media since the early 2000s, probably earlier.
             </p>
             <p>
              The CIA has controlled ALL major media outlets since the 1950s via Operation Mockingbird.

               Actually, if you want to get stupid, which is one of your hallmarks, fake news has been around since the dawn of man, ever since the first cave man climbed up on a rock and told his hoard of villagers that that a wholly mammoth was spotted going the wrong way down a one way cave, in an attempt to boost ratings. However, the term Fake News, as actually uttered repeatedly by newscasters everywhere was indeed invented because of Pizzagate, as the OP correctly observes. Your attempt to crawl from one thread to another to prove how powerful you are by belittling people really annoys me. So big man, I'm looking forward to your reply. I'm going to bed, so don't expect any response to your plop tonight.
