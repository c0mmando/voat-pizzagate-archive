            Getting sick of the drama surrounding Seaman. He's an alright dude who helped spread the word, but he's clearly needing a payday for his services. Nothing wrong with that. The problem arises when he takes the bait trolls leave, which distracts from the purpose of the investigation. He isn't unlike Alex  in that he needs to sell product in order to provide service. Every one of AJ's videos ends with some pitch for colloidal silver or super testosterone alpha male bullshit. Anyone and everyone who takes time to debate these guys is detracting from the research and awareness campaign. Let them do their thing: they'll either maintain pace, hence keeping up; slow down, becoming a speed bump; or pull off onto the shoulder, disappearing into the rearview. Regardless, the Seamen and Jones's and such of the world are spokes, not cogs. They, along with the rest of us, revolve around the story - not the other way around.

            I believe people are getting threatened. no doubt. But you know who is behind those threats. I dont believe David Seaman is a threat to anyone, I think at some point this is now psychological warfare to get the researchers to start going after each other to discredit them. I would imagine that Trump wants the info out there but HE has no control over the press, that is obvious by the way they are trying to take Him out. He is a threat to these pedophiles and their control over the government and media and He, himself, has tweeted about perverts needing the death penalty.
           </p>
           <p>
            If anything, i would imaging that Trump wants those who are reporting on it to step back for a bit so that 1. they dont get killed because some have died and we need these guys to report the truth when it all busts loose, 2. there is so much that you guys are finding out about and new info, these people are covering their tracks because you are putting it all out there and they are reading this. They now know to pull up stakes and hide the evidence. They don't do that in a real investigation, release all their cards so that the criminals can cover tracks. and 3. there is so much dis info that it muddies the plausibility enough so that the unbelievers can just write it all off as a conspiracy.
           </p>
           <p>
            We all need to be careful, especially those who are doing the bulk of the research and reporting. Too many reporters and investigators have been threatened, harassed, followed and killed over this. There are sick dangerous people who will do what it takes to keep this from being exposed and if they have no problems killing little babies and torturing and killing children they will have no problem killing us. You can tell that they are worried by the way that they continue to attack him on everything and he has only been president for a month! He is a threat to THEM and once they go after these sick fucks, the we the people need to help smoke them ALL out and help put them away.
           </p>
           <p>
            This is not to say that anyone should stop doing the work, but BE CAREFUL, this is high stakes and protecting the children of the future from these beasts. I think putting the signs, symbols, testimonies, and some of that info out there is good but if you are finding REAL and valid information, That should go directly to someone who is handling this like the FBI (if they can be trusted, or get it to Alex Jones, if he has connections to the Trump people.. Be careful out there.
