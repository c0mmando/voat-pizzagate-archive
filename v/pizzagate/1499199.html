           .gmail.com isn't a commonly used passthrough for Gmail servers. It's not a known configuration for IMAP, SMTP, or POP3 general allowances as far as I know.  It also is something unique to his particular email address, none of the other ones that I've seen published seem to use it. They all seem to use mail.google.com.  2) The source code at the very bottom of the "Dominos" email has unnecessary formatting and what would appear to be a ghost URL.
