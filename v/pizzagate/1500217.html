            I'm gonna say they probly won't. They most likely already had all they needed and had to sway public opinion because large court cases like this are very politically charged. Especially if the current establishment is as heavily involved as we suspect. We need them to stay quiet, sit on their damning evidence and crush them when the environment is capable of doing so.

            A smoking gun could be found, just as with any case. Sometimes Dutroux gets caught, and sometimes the one whose name we don't know gets away.

            I agree with you on how difficult it will be to find the smoking gun. It's been a while since I read 1 of the AMA from FBIAnon, but I recall that he said that the FBI has all the evidence that it needs. It just needs political will power, and that's all that we have to focus on.

             Exactly -- apparently this has been going on for decades. The investigative power of near-instant information of this new age is unprecedented and novel, but the elite perpetrators have had systems in place and plenty of time to build complex webs to hide their tracks and undermine analysis. Doesn't mean we won't find something -- but I think it's possible we can more easily and more quickly force a new leak or change the political climate enough to move the IC/DOJ to open action.
            </p>
            <p>
             Again, this is not a call to cease investigation -- just a reminder that our efforts should always include infecting social outlets and grabbing more media spotlight until concrete evidence is undeniable.

            I wouldn't say the open sourced investigation cannot find a smoking gun. There are a few things that in any reasonable investigation would be considered very damming. The podesta bus for instance. If we can get that close to a smoking gun we can go a step further and have the actual gun. Forget not that all of this is based on blackmail, in order to blackmail someone there has to be evidence of the crime. If there is evidence then it can be uncovered. Not always easy to do, but it is possible.

            What about the Wikileaks stuff that hasn't been released yet, that is out there somewhere, is there anyway of getting it? I guess not or it would be out already. I assume there are plenty of people with those kinds of skills working on it all the time.

            Things that would help would be victims/witnesses to come forward publicly.

             I'm talking about a forced leak of certain information that works to deflect public opinion -- a controlled leak, as most are. Seeing their chosen scapegoats implicated and indicted/pardoned will create many more avenues of investigation for us and help sustain our attempts to gain more public eyes on the web of slime's many tendrils.
