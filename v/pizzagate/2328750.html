<p>MONDAY, JANUARY 08, 2018</p>
<p><strong>Himmmm Blind Item #1 - Golden Globes</strong></p>
<p>After a ceremony so full of itself it could float, and after flying through 3 countries in 24 hours to arrive at the Golden Globes, I was very happy to get to the after party circuit.  One party in particular led to a twilight zone moment of epic proportions, even involving Enty, and may have just created the funniest moment I\'ve ever had at any awards night party in the past 10 years at least.  This winning/nominated A list mostly movie actor was busy getting glad hands and smiles and laughs from all the ass-kissers.  He\'s just yammering on about how &quot;honored&quot; he was just to be included and so &quot;proud&quot; of the work everyone did.  Standing there talking to three young ingenue actresses - whom I didn\'t know and who probably would\'ve been happy to &quot;bow&quot; to him - our big winner/nominee is lost in his cloud of pride.</p>
<p>In the moments preceding this, I had been talking to an old friend of mine from another country.  He\'s a hilarious guy and a good friend, and he always enjoys creating mischief.  Usually it is by using his broken English trick to accidentally humiliate hypocrites and jerks - all while pretending he just said the wrong words. It\'s a testament to his acting skills.  So earlier we got together to plan a little moment of cold water for this winning abuser.  Oops, I mean actor.</p>
<p>I\'m standing about 2 feet away from the winning actor, and his flunky/management stooge/PR sycophant.  I\'m trying not to vomit on my tux-matched tennis shoes as the winner/nominee is hitting on the three young women, and I\'m scrolling through my phone. In walks the foreign actor who is A- list and has a big television gig straight ahead who had stepped outside for a minute.  The foreign actor walks straight over to our winner and tells him totally straight-faced: &quot;Hey bro - you better not go out the front door when you leave man.  I heard reporters out there talking about some shit on Twitter about you and some high school girls and acting schools. Serious man, they were staring at their phones and I think they gonna ask you about it bro. Could be bad man&quot; </p>
<p>The winning/nominated actor\'s face goes totally pale.  You could\'ve knocked him over with a feather.  I swear he didn\'t breathe for a solid minute. He just stares at the foreign actor, who nods his head up and down silently.  I said: &quot;Oh shit&quot;. The winner then turns and looks at me.  I hold up my phone - showing him the tweets from my favorite blogger/twitter ninja (his name rhymes with minty). Also in there is a re-tweet from a legendary 80s actress. The winner says: &quot;Oh...f**k...nah man.  Of all nights...&quot;.  Then, the winner hands me my phone, turns to his flunky saying: &quot;Hey man let\'s bail&quot;, and they walk swiftly across the room, out of the back doors.  The foreign actor turns back to me, smiles and winks, and says in his rapid-fire Spanish to me: &quot;That\'s a shame huh? Not a single reporter out there except those two TMZ guys.&quot;.  I start to stifle the smiles.</p>
<p>We both try to contain our laughter like kids in class.  One of those three ingenues the winner had been hitting on grabs my coat and says: &quot;Excuse me, sorry, but what did you show him?&quot;. I told her to get her phone.  I gave her the CDAN web address and Enty\'s Twitter feed.  As the foreign actor and I walked off trying not to explode in laughter, all three crowded around their screen, mouths open.  All I heard was an audible gasp. It was a good night after all. (Good job buddy!).</p>

             Blind Items Revealed #3
            </strong>

           <p>
            October 16, 2017
           </p>
           <p>
            Someone this week sent me a tip about a sexual assault that happened. What made this different is that when I read the tip, I realized the person assaulted is someone I know. That's not to say I haven't known many people in the industry who have been assaulted, I just didn't know she had. The other crazy thing is that it is in her words. The tipster took a screenshot from a private group my friend belongs to. Have you heard of my friend? I don't know. She is super funny and makes me laugh until I cry when she performs. She does some acting and other things.
           </p>
           <p>
            The person who assaulted her is in an acting family. He is an A list mostly movie actor who is an Academy Award winner/nominee. If you read the site, you know this is not the first time he ha done something like this. He has never been the person you look to for morals or ethics.

            "This isn't exactly comedy related., but I needed to warn my fellow femme artists, in light of the Weinstein revelation.
           </p>
           <p>
            About a year and a half ago I was sexually assaulted by ______________. After mounting himself on my then underage friend after she kept saying no, he started talking to me and offering to read my scripts. I was of course excited and had a bit of a crush on him. We made out and fooled around, I was thrilled. One time he told me to drive to set at night, I did and brought him a birthday card. He glanced at it and then looked around and suddenly had his d**k out. I got nervous and didn't do anything. He moved my hand on it and then started pushing my head down. I resisted but he kept pushing. I didn't move and he got frustrated. I finally gave in. He left right after. I felt disgusting and he sent me a dirty text. I drove home crying. I felt like I had to be nice to him after that. I drunkenly told him he was a sexual predator. He told me I was crazy. I apologized to him, fearing he would ruin my career. I was only 22. I wish I spoke up about this sooner because it's been eating at me. Sharing this isn't easy, I'm sweating as I type this. But I'm sick and tired of the men of Hollywood getting away with sexual assault. It took this town 20 years to expose Harvey Weinstein. I want to keep an open dialogue so that doesn't happen again."

            The LA Times got five women to go on the record about behavior by James Franco that was an abuse of power. Two of them women had previously called out James on social media. What I think is going to be next is there is going to be a flood of women from his "acting schools," who are going to come forward and repeat the same stories told by these five women. Basically, Franco promised them roles in his movies if they agreed to get naked or have sex with him. If they refused, then they would get no roles. Even if they did get a role, it was more often than not for hooker or stripper or some other throwaway character.
           </p>
           <p>
            It also appears that the only students in his acting classes who ever got considered for roles were women. No guys. I wish the Times would have asked his attorney, who denied all the charges, why the two acting schools closed in the dead of night without any notice.
           </p>
           <p>
            One of the acting students said a shoot was in a strip club for what was supposed to be a jeans commercial. She says when everyone got there, it obviously had nothing to do with jeans and was just an excuse for Franco and his pals to film a bunch of women in lingerie and masks. When he asked which women would get topless or naked and none agreed, he stormed off.
           </p>
           <p>
            There is one movie discussed where it sounds as if Franco just wanted to have sex with a bunch of women and have them naked while they worshiped him and then put it all on film with no hope it would ever see the light of day outside his living room. The guy is so exploitative.

            Blind Item #4
Apparently on more than one occasion, this A list mostly movie actor forced himself on this former back in the day A list mostly movie actress who has not acted in some time. One of the times was witnessed by someone who walked in on the pair in his dressing room. The actress was topless and on her knees and as soon as the door opened, the actress made a break for it as fast as she could. The actor laughed it off.

            How does this prove he "forced himself"? The facts are also consistent with consensual sex in which the actress left in embarrassment after being discovered in flagrante delicto.

            Seriously though I wondered that upon reading it,and then thought back on the original tweet. Definitely unsure as to why she would be forced. It was a show they were in (can’t temember who directed?) -but did he yield that much power? She has always appeared to be extremely autonomous and fierce, on a way. Like her character in High Art(good film,great performance )

            Blind Item #6
           </p>
           <p>
            There are several people who witnessed this disgraced A list producer making out and groping an actress at party. I think we all could kind of guess that part. The actress was in a state of undress. The producer was married and his wife was pregnant. The host of this particular party was this permanent A++++ list celebrity who everyone knows in every corner of the world. Despite witnessing what was happening and calling out the producer, the A++++ lister invited the producer to a party the next month where he basically did the same thing again with an entirely different actress. Never uttered a peep about it to anyone.

            This former almost A list mostly movie actress is still a mostly movie actress and still has almost A list name recognition but she is down to a B- now because of the roles she has been able to snag. She is also creating some waves because she has threatened to go public with why she has missed some recent events. It turns out that at a previous event she was promoting, this almost A list mostly movie actor kept putting his arm around her and groping her and suggesting they go smoke some pot together. He would just not leave her alone until she cried. She has refused to do anything else with him.

              Franco actually laughed about Watson walking off set when Mila Kunis interviewed him.

             Anyway, Franco’s “difficult” smearing worked - Enty himself described her as such in a Golden Globes blind, saying she doesn’t have many more chances left.

            You have an industry based on, supported by and run by people with no moral core surrounded by "yes" people and sycophants and so hilariously un-aware of how racist, homophobic and sexist they are compared with the rest of the country, it's astounding that they are given any credibility at all. But the general public continues to admire and put these people on pedestals they do not deserve, so as long as that happens and the media continues to be more focused on celebrity and ratings than journalism, Hollywood will survive and nothing will change. "Meet the new boss/same as the old boss."

            James Franco drugged and raped girls and got away with it. Anyone with any sense runs when they see that idiot. Unfortunately he has friends in high places, gets his way by pulling strings.

             Marina Abramovic uses gold particles as food in ceremonial rituals among the elite.
            </p>
            <p>
             “The Gold Ball recipe was given to Ms. Abramović by a Tibetan monastery. The practice of consuming a Gold Ball usually follows a long period of fasting and seclusion. In keeping with this tradition, the artist has planned a performance dessert piece in which the guests will apply a 24K golden leaf to their mouths before tasting the Gold Ball. By consuming the Gold Ball together with her guests, Marina Abramović marks the end of her longest performance ever.”[1]
            </p>
            <p>
             Her ceremonials for the elite also include a treat called Golden Lips that were cast from Abramović’s mouth—the mold was then poured with dark chocolate and the lips were dusted with edible 24K gold.[2]
            </p>
            <p>
             As an announcement for the ceremonial consumption of gold, it was stated, “The concept of eating the gold leaf first became important for Abramović when she was given a gold ball to eat at a Tibetan monastery. This practice, which typically happens after a long period of fasting and seclusion, dates back to the 6th century and helps to achieve a clear state of mind.”[3]
            </p>
            <p>
             6th century Tibet was ruled by shamanism and animism. It was a pre-Buddhist spiritual and religious culture known as Bon. Practitioners of these shamanic techniques of Bon involved ecstasy and ritual magic. Their methods of working with energy was known as a Bonpo. Originally the word Bonpo meant someone who invoked the gods and summoned the spirits. A Bonpo was an expert in the use of mantra and magical evocation.
            </p>
            <p>
             There seems to be a strong parallel of the role of the Bonpo in ancient Tibet with that of the Druids. Just as the Druidic order was divided into the three functions of the Bards, the Vates, and the Druids, who were singers, soothsayers, and magicians respectively, so the ancient pre-Buddhist kingdom of Tibet was said to be protected by the Drung (sgrung) who were bards and singers of epics, the Deu (lde’u) who were soothsayers and diviners, and the Bonpo (bon-po) who were priests and magicians.[4] Consistent with the practice of ancient pagan animism, Druids committed cannibalism and ritual human sacrifice.[5] The Bon religion that reigned supreme in Tibet during the 6th century also had elements of ritual cannibalism and human sacrifice as part of its practice.[6]

           <blockquote>
            <p>
             Sarah Tither-Kaplan, who was once a student of Franco’s at his acting school, alleged that Franco exploited her by asking her to strip down on set for only $100 per day after she signed a "vague and general at best" contract.
“Remember a few weeks ago when you told me the full nudity you had me do in two of your movies for $100/day wasn't exploitative because I signed a contract to do it? Times up on that!" she tweeted. “I 100% did not feel like I had a choice to say no.”
Actress Violet Paley claimed the actor once sexually assaulted her and tried to lure her 17-year-old friend to his hotel room.
"Cute #TimesUp pin James Franco. Remember the time you pushed my head down in a car towards your exposed penis &amp; that other time you told my friend to come to your hotel when she was 17? After you had already been caught doing that to a different 17 year old?" she wrote on Twitter.

                   To kinda add to that I had some serious intellectual property theft. Back in 1995 I was starting a production company out of Vancouver. My partner was adamant we call it Lionsgate. For 2 or 3 years prior to this I was writing scripts, optioning screenplays I liked and writing treatments or story ideas. All for the planned production company with a partner named John A Hardy, a lawyer from Vancouver. At the time I knew guys like Shane Black and others. I had had a partnership (3 of us) in a bar in Venice beach called the Pink. Even with that my association has almost been wiped clean except for people that worked for me there and remember me as  'good guy'.I also rewrote plays  for people like Velina Houston (a REAL CUNT) . _to jump ahead to Haggis ...well, he set out to make up BS lies about me. It had to do with Robert Lantos and him scooping  something off me. 
Now of course, after my  children were stolen(23 years ago) and all the slander I am not exactly the same man I was but I am still a motherfucker creatively.Haggis is not an original. He has to steal or borrow. Here's the ironies of ironies. he is from London Ontario. A small boring city west of Toronto. My girlfriend (for the past 14 years) was up until recently best friend's with Haggis's sister Joey Haggis, or Joey Francis. We know, beyond a shadow of a doubt, that he has made up really career destroying lies about me. Haggis and Lantos won't let up. They are, after over 22 years, just fucking relentless.Haggis made up a lie that I  assaulted a young girl at his TFF party. Problem is, Kim, my girlfriend, friend of his sister, was next to me THE WHOLE TIME! As was her son Casey for most that night. These scum will do anything to cover their rip offs. Ad insult to injury Crash was distributed by Lionsgate and Giustra, which, back in 95, was MY DAMN COMPANY. this whole thing is such a duck fuck. It is just unreal. I have continued being me, being creative but have been completely shut down. I don't know if Haggis abuses kids, but his daughter's art work is questionable to say the least. Lots more to ass such my ex being a sex kitten prostitute but that just seems too crazy given all the other weird shit. Much much more to add about the harassment, the profiling, the targeting but I'll give you a break. I am 60 years old now, had almost half my life destroyed because these kind of 'deletes' want to cover for their crimes. I suppose Kim being close to that family is pretty far fetched but it is the truth. Joey just recently unfriended her. No one from the haggis camp has contacted me to threaten me or accuse me of slander (this isn't the only place I have been vocal).
 As a side note I played Jared Leto's father in a film so I have an strong opinion about that prick too. 
Yeah, funny huh? But these kind of people will NEVER let up. they will do anything to discredit and destroy those they steal from or that they deem dangerous.

                    That is quite the ringer. I am so sorry for the pain people have caused you. This is so terrible and I really hope you are finding some solace and perhaps a little peace from all the redpilling occurring on this site and others. The universe is currently working in very mysterious ways and wreaking a revenge on the individuals who have caused so much harm over the years. You're with good people here! I totally believe you about the video game industry: I have seen first hand the way in which it is manipulating and destroying childhoods. I hope there will be a bigger discussion on that here soon. I hope your son is ok now.

                     Thanks. My son, my daughter, wasn't a thing i could do all those years ago. I was way outmatched but it woke me up to the nefarious fucks that control things. My daughter was, beyond a shadow of a doubt, involved in an assassination in Corsica. They(my 2 children) finally connected with us when we live in Montreal. She told us this story about being on a yacht and the man she worked for being killed. She admitted she had 7 hours of missing time but still, we weren't sure. After they left we looked it up online and sure enough, her whole damn story checks out. Are my children evil? Of course not!! But they are used in these missions and it breaks my heart to think they could be asasins but have no memory of it. Both of them are so cool, kinda hippies kids so you would never think this from the outside looking in. Neither child would have chosen this and what kills me, is I had  chance to ask no questions(back in 95) and have custody of both of them. Shit, hindsight is 20/20

            Ally Sheedy tweeted: “James Franco just won. Please never ever ask me why I left the film/TV business.” and "“Why is a man hosting? Why is James Franco allowed in? Said too much.”

            Franco should be arrested he's guilty of serious crimes including accessory to murder Google Chris Cornell Death and James Franco plus he's guilty of helping facilitate minors for sex parties with Bryan Singer young boys and young girls at other parties. I predict Franco won't ever return to America he might stay in France with Polanski for a very long time.

             That's one problem I have with the spectator sport that is CDAN.  I believe that Enty wants to do something about some of the atrocities that he has heard of but once again the timing is ominous,  especially on the variance of whichever conspiracy theory you espouse,  however you slice it these things have gone on a long time and alot of people have known about it for quite some time,  and only now this Enty is willing to spill the beans?  Why for so long have these bored housewives and time wasters been sitting commiserating together over Hollywood crimes that should have been investigated,  solved,  and truthfully reported to the public on a timely basis. Since this has not been done and this episode has exploded quite spontaneously right before our very eyes suggests to me part of a plan that is much larger than any one small group in Hollywood could ever comprehend.
            </p>
            <p>
             A few ppl there have awakened to the fact that there's some serious felonious activity happening now and things in the past that should be addressed.  Once again I think Enty has the best of intentions and is disseminating in a slow burn fashion (considering most of his hearsay is circumstantial as it is),  I still find his lack of attention for urgency slightly annoying.

            Have posted this a bunch before: the only reason Franco passed all his other classes (and not the one described in the link) is because he was sleeping with all those other teachers.

             James Franco did a splendid job of slaughtering the literary works by authors such as Hermann Hesse, John Steinbeck and William Faulkner... Lets just say he had to bring out his inner "artist" when he did the cover and foreword to the new release of Demian (Hesse). Finger painting and a stoner rant... Professor Franco still has a lot to learn, to put it mildly.

              I agree, not that Im a snob for any of that shit but Franco drags its intellectual aura into a pretentious quagmire of so-cal obnoxiousness. Probably where it belongs to tell you the truth.

             Milo Ventimiglia

                    This article was posted in a comment on DL about Misty Upham who was raped at the Golden Globes.  It was part of a just recent CDAN Blind.  Her parents come clean about the whole thing and it is Very Shocking.

                    Girls?  Idk, probably anything he can get his hands on.  I heard that is what Franco does.  He has all these girls in naked pics and it might be a cover up because today I read on CDAN that he has been with many young boys too.  So.  You never know.  These guys are tricky but we are not stupid.

              Would not be surprised.  He charges you know.  What kind of host charges his guests.  Unless they are buying something VERY expensive.  All the right people are in those pictures on his yachts.  They are all suspect and rich enough to buy what he has to offer.

               always seems to, too. Not a peep about Tommy, huh? And I am sure his skeletons are the biggest in all of HWood. I don't know about anything pedo, but I DO know this story of a drunk Australian male model getting lost in Beverly Hills and

                  How can ANYONE NOT be suspicious of a man that accepts a role as one of the most notorious drug runners in American History. We have Tom fucking Cruise putting a smile, in-shape and "handsome" face to one of the men MOST responsible for introducing the genocidal weapon cocaine and then crack to the worlds impoverished and in most cases, BLACK youth,America and the world and HOLLYWOOD wants to make Barry Seal look like a STRAIGHT normal FAMILY MAN? Like Jason Bateman in Ozark they make it appear as though thesemen are selling drugs so that they can maintain a large family with all of the American perks and amenties, making it appear as though the lone rogue, entreprenuer  with American balls of steal are the only ones to get ahead in this world, oh but sometimes you pay the ultimate price. What fucking BULLSHIT. What a STRAIGHT PIECE OF SHIT PROPAGANDA PIECE... the CIA had to "infiltrate" at the highest levels so that they can "control" it, another line of bullshit.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  Barry Seal was a fat child molesting drug dealing murderer that got turned out by Civil Air Patrol pilot David Ferry ALONG WITH LEE HARVEY OSWALD.

                 <p>
                  But I digress. How in the world could you be as old as Tom cruise and NOT run across the information that L Ron Hubbard and Jack Parsons, hile LRon was plotting to steal his wife, made Scientology up as a BET TO EACH OTHER THAT THEY COULD NOT ONLY CREATE A RELIGION BUT MAKE IT FLOURISH WITHIN A SPECIFIED TIME PERIOD, and it was to be loosely based off of the principals of Aleister Crowley's OTO?
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  How fuckin dumb do you have to be cruise just a few google buttons nowadays all of you scientologists look more stupid that a CLDS or Mormon OMG.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  Of course we all know there is way too much money involved in the Scientology scam for some if not all of them to walk away, plus it's to elaborate of a CIA cult it would take an utter disaster to dismantle it.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  Idk, there SO MUCH strange stuff about cruise, so much.

                   <p>
                    “The story actually starts back when I was about twelve years old and I met one of the great men of Freudian analysis – a Commander Thompson. He was a commander in the United States Navy. Anyway, at the Library of Congress in Washington, DC, where they have all the books on everything, he started shoving my nose into an education in the field of the mind. Now, that’s a very unusual thing to do, to take a twelve-year-old boy and start doing something with the mind. But he really got me interested in the subject – up to the point where I was pretty sure that Freud didn’t know what he was talking about. My father was an officer in the Navy and he moved me from here to there. I studied quite a bit of MYSTICISM.”[16]

                    LBH virtually bled the secretive ONI. On May 1, 1930, LRH joined a Marine Corps Reserve training unit. He was placed on inactive status the same day, and spent only five weeks of his 18-month stint actually doing anything that is public information-ONI spy, above.

                   <p>
                    In 1939, LRH moved to Manhattan, NY in some very exclusive military intelligence dinner [briefing] company honoring Dr. Willy Ley. It included Lt. (Retired) Naval Commander, Robert A. Heinlein, and Lt. Commander of the U.S. Coast Guard, Johnny Arwine, Science Fiction Writers, John W. Campbell, and Sprague de Camp.[17]
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    Lt. Heinlein was leading an off the books secret ONI operation (science fiction think tank)  through the Bureau of Navigation via the Commandant Eleventh Naval District.[18] Form the 1940 U.S. Census on Lookout Mountain Avenue in Los Angeles, Lt. Heinlein (Richard and Sigred) and his wife Leslyn may have actually been posing as German Nationals living a double spy life.[19] They must have spoke fluent Germany.

                    ONI Naval Lt. Robert A. Heinlein, above U.S. Navy 1929, was one of the most famed and respected writers of science fiction’s “Golden Age,” which occurred from the 1940s to the 1950s. Heinlein’s science fiction recruits worked out of the U.S. Naval Air Experiment Center in Philadelphia, PA.[34] Lt. Heinlein’s secret think tank also included George O. Smith, Murray Leinster (Will F. Jenkins), L. Sprague de Camp, Isaac Asimov, and Fletcher Pratt.[35]

                    LRH was not beyond the others using the information gained through the off the books secret operation for personal profit and glorification. LRH’s Dianetics, set of ideas and practices regarding the metaphysical relationship between the mind and body, was not invented by him or created out of a vacuum.

                    DIANETICS had some of its roots in the secret occult metaphysical theories of “VRIL Forces” and practices of Lucifer’s Servants, Reichsfuhrer SS Heinrich Himmler’s SS Knights of the Black Sun and the Ahnenerbe SS. It was classified and Top Secret and the CIA formed in 1947 wanted its Nazi pseudo occult-Vril science back.

                    They were all spooks, and everyone that has created offshoots of thier philosophies. Stan Lee knows ALL about his role in the New World Order and what a DYSFUNCTIONAL IMAGINATION an do to a child brain. Get them concerned with being a superhero all through their adolescence instead of focusing on real life issues. In many ways along with all of the other input from every other false medium of entertainment captures childrens imaginations at the most crucial point in the development of it's brain and imprints on it. Of course repeated imagery and themes are repeated throughout for an overall ambient mk-ultra that effects us all.

                    Science fiction, comic books, ALL OF IT contains MYSTICAL elements that eventually, almost imperceptibly, suggestibly lure people into studying the occult, freemasonry and the like. I've always wondered how scientists could be so cold and careless as to mes around with forces like dark matter that has the potential to turn the universe inside out, until I understood luciferianism.

                   What the above video implies is that the CIA recruits its agents the same way it creates terrorists, getting them while they're young with a range of sexual and psychological abuse. The MO never changes. It is literally creating demons in these children by the violent aggressive act of penetrating the anus at a young age, chakra activation, as well as for 'practical' field and military secret protocols (homosexual indoctrination;roman,greek).

                When you read the answers to the Blinds on CDAN there are people that are onto Geffen and Cruise.  I see their names come up once in a while.  So, they are not getting away with it.  It just needs to come out.  Enty has to cover it.  I wonder if even Enty is too afraid to go there.  What more do you know about the Geffen and CDAN Rumors?  Did he really buy it.

              That's what ppl are still tossing around based on that Diana Jenkins lady blind from a few years back...  I personally don't think it's HIMMMM.  Some of the comments have hinted there are 4 different 'HIMMMM' s that spy for Enty.  It really is a tough identity to decipher although I believe at least one of them might have given out a few too many clues in the last Golden Globes Kindness blind than I would be comfortable with.

               considering that RDJ aint no saint I can't see him drawing unwanted attention to himself. As it is, lots of rumors about him currently cheating on the producer wife and his oldest kid being an total druggie fuck up.

                  A post I made elsewhere on sci-fi:
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  The Story of Dianetics and Scientology, an LRH lecture 18 October 1958 –
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  “The story actually starts back when I was about twelve years old and I met one of the great men of Freudian analysis – a Commander Thompson. He was a commander in the United States Navy. Anyway, at the Library of Congress in Washington, DC, where they have all the books on everything, he started shoving my nose into an education in the field of the mind. Now, that’s a very unusual thing to do, to take a twelve-year-old boy and start doing something with the mind. But he really got me interested in the subject – up to the point where I was pretty sure that Freud didn’t know what he was talking about. My father was an officer in the Navy and he moved me from here to there. I studied quite a bit of MYSTICISM.”[16]

                  LBH virtually bled the secretive ONI. On May 1, 1930, LRH joined a Marine Corps Reserve training unit. He was placed on inactive status the same day, and spent only five weeks of his 18-month stint actually doing anything that is public information-ONI spy, above.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  In 1939, LRH moved to Manhattan, NY in some very exclusive military intelligence dinner [briefing] company honoring Dr. Willy Ley. It included Lt. (Retired) Naval Commander, Robert A. Heinlein, and Lt. Commander of the U.S. Coast Guard, Johnny Arwine, Science Fiction Writers, John W. Campbell, and Sprague de Camp.[17]
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  Lt. Heinlein was leading an off the books secret ONI operation (science fiction think tank)  through the Bureau of Navigation via the Commandant Eleventh Naval District.[18] Form the 1940 U.S. Census on Lookout Mountain Avenue in Los Angeles, Lt. Heinlein (Richard and Sigred) and his wife Leslyn may have actually been posing as German Nationals living a double spy life.[19] They must have spoke fluent Germany.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  John W. Campbell, Jr., above, Science Fiction Writer of the RKO Film Studio infamous thriller “The Thing” (1953) was part of the secret science fiction think tank.[32] Campbell was also an early board member of the Hubbard Dianetics Research Foundation in 1950[33].

                  ONI Naval Lt. Robert A. Heinlein, above U.S. Navy 1929, was one of the most famed and respected writers of science fiction’s “Golden Age,” which occurred from the 1940s to the 1950s. Heinlein’s science fiction recruits worked out of the U.S. Naval Air Experiment Center in Philadelphia, PA.[34] Lt. Heinlein’s secret think tank also included George O. Smith, Murray Leinster (Will F. Jenkins), L. Sprague de Camp, Isaac Asimov, and Fletcher Pratt.[35]

                 <p>
                  LRH was not beyond the others using the information gained through the off the books secret operation for personal profit and glorification. LRH’s Dianetics, set of ideas and practices regarding the metaphysical relationship between the mind and body, was not invented by him or created out of a vacuum.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  DIANETICS had some of its roots in the secret occult metaphysical theories of “VRIL Forces” and practices of Lucifer’s Servants, Reichsfuhrer SS Heinrich Himmler’s SS Knights of the Black Sun and the Ahnenerbe SS. It was classified and Top Secret and the CIA formed in 1947 wanted its Nazi pseudo occult-Vril science back.

                  They were all spooks, and everyone that has created offshoots of thier philosophies. Stan Lee knows ALL about his role in the New World Order and what a DYSFUNCTIONAL IMAGINATION an do to a child brain. Get them concerned with being a superhero all through their adolescence instead of focusing on real life issues. In many ways along with all of the other input from every other false medium of entertainment captures childrens imaginations at the most crucial point in the development of it's brain and imprints on it. Of course repeated imagery and themes are repeated throughout for an overall ambient mk-ultra that effects us all.

                 <p>
                  Science fiction, comic books, ALL OF IT contains MYSTICAL elements that eventually, almost imperceptibly, suggestibly lure people into studying the occult, freemasonry and the like. I've always wondered how scientists could be so cold and careless as to mes around with forces like dark matter that has the potential to turn the universe inside out, until I understood luciferianism.

            I seem to have a growing disdain for this entire #MeToo movement because it is obviously and blatantly ignoring one huge demographic of abuse that is as all pervading and systemic as Hebophilic and of-age sexual harassment, non-consent and rape incidents that happen everyday in Hollywood. Unfortunately, this substratus of Hollywood abuse will NEVER GET BROACHED due to the very same wide reaching interconnected nexus of subversive coercion these women are trying to speak out against. But somehow, and oddly enough, these women keep forgetting to speak out about all of the MALE AND FEMALE UNDERAGE VICTIMS that Hollywood churns out every year, all of the sick and twisted real life Hollywood stories that sometimes go WAY BEYOND even their own movie scripts. Why? Because that interconnected nexus has dirt on EVERYONE and roots that reach up into the CIA,Mk-Ultra and Monarch Mind Control Programming from the Nazi's Project Paperclip (Jared Leto owns their former production unit for MK-Utra training and Nuke test videos) you bet there is rhyme and reason why many of these women have been tapped (like Bill Cosby's accusers from Hugh Hefner's Honey Trap) to go public about these incidents that happened many years ago. I'm not saying these events were not real, horrific or scarring, but what I am suggesting is that these women were under 'accepted and normal' pressures of being in Hollywood (some under consent and complicity), career obligations, coercion and threat, among many other things AS WELL AS FOR BEING UNDER CONTRACT FOR WHEN THE TIME IS RIGHT.

            Much of the reason for this disclosure is a an alchemical magickal process by which you are all being psychologically stripped of your IDOLS, people that you have looked up to for generations, as a demoralizing tool, to weaken your self-esteem and outlook upon the world. Essentially you are being conned into giving up hope for the world.

            who Tweeted that at least one guy at the #GoldenGlobes wearing a #TIMESUP pin was probably a predator. There are dozens. You know what though? All of it is ignored unless it is inconvenient to their own brand. All of these people will continue to jump at the chance to work with Christian Slater, Mel Gibson, Kevin Spacey, Woody Allen, Roman Polanski, James Franco, Johnny Depp, Columbus Short, Sean Penn, Nicolas Cage, Mike Tyson, Alec Baldwin, Charlie Sheen, Sean Bean, Michael Fassbender, Wesley Snipes, Sylvester Stallone, Josh Brolin, R. Kelly, John Travolta, CeeLo Green, Bryan Singer, Anthony Kiedis, Jimmy Page, Marilyn Manson, Louis CK, TJ Miller, Sean Kingston. I could do this all night. Have you noticed that all the accusers are to be believed UNLESS it happens to be a friend or loved one of an actress and then the accuser is to be doubted or the actress doesn't know all the facts. I'm looking at you Rose McGowan and Amy Smart and Dominique Moceanu. Don't even get me started on Blake Lively and all the rest with Woody Allen blinders. I want to know how come everyone believed Ronan Farrow about Harvey, but no one believes Dylan Farrow? Why? Because then they would have to confront the fact they cared more about their brand and working with Woody then Dylan being molested. Think about that next year when all of you will be continuing the good fight and see all of the people in Hollywood be the hypocrites they are.

             While Seth Myers was making jokes about Weinstein not being seen for another 20 years and everyone laughed, I wondered what percentage of the men in the audience were internally wiping a sweaty brow thinking, 'Thank goodness I didn't get caught'.  For every rat you find, you know there are many others you don't see.  That goes for the rapists in Hollywood.  Weinstein was the scapegoat, but why and for whom?

              Because then they would have to confront the fact they cared more about their brand and working with Woody then Dylan being molested.

            Great post!
           </p>
           <p>
            Saw tweets all day about Franco. A lot of people were not happy ... now this ... almost instant karma ...
           </p>
           <p>
            A more sanctimonious bunch of satanists I never did see. How they managed to walk around with their tongues up their own asses is beyond me. The dog and pony shows used to be at least entertaining because I cared about that crop of satanic ritual abuses. Now? Now I can't watch any of those blood drinkers without gagging and saying The Lord's Prayer until the image burned into my retinas disappears.
           </p>
           <p>
            Hope they enjoyed themselves at the after-douche party because tick tock ... #timeisup unholy fornicators.

             By carefully saying “I don’t know what I did," “not accurate,” he’s laying groundwork for a case that he was naïve and thought the behavior was OK. Globes validated his Oscar chances; this is a proactive attempt by the studio to protect their investment.  cc:@entylawyer #gross

             I find it utterly contemptable that Hollywood stage this entire event for the publics eyes unless they ALL have something more in store for us.

             Oprah of all people spearheading the effort with a poignant speech when her and her lesbian cohorts have indulged in the 'lifestyles of the rich and famous' for years now. I don't see her raising an eyebrow at her rich friends that are rumored to be highly involved in much of the mess we see before us, what's the scoop on your buddies Richard Branson and textile producers like Peter Nygard and his Carribean Mayan-inspired Nygard Cay? Johnny Depp, David Copperfield, Kenny Chesney,Jeffrey Epstein and many others ain't got islands down there for no reason at all.

               Well of course you have already alluded to the answer. Her reason is fraud but it's obvious that fraud was the lie he told her he was straight,  or realized since she wasn't as cool a beard as he thought she was going to be reduced or discontinued beard payments.  Either way those 'unsubstantiated'  rumors are so very true and most of those escapades happen,  or happened,  before the hurricane that devastated most of these elite pedo playgrounds,  on the US Virgin Island territory of St John's.

                Thanks ASolo. But surely Renee had had sex with him before marrying him so would have known he was gay beforehand? Or did she tie the knot and then found out he actually liked kids?
               </p>
               <p>
                I know nothing about Kenny Chesney. I just remembering thinking the Renee thing was so odd at the time....

              Difference. Trump pulls rank on Harvey here and ensures the women's attention is on him. Harvey looks like hes wandered into someone elses photo. Melania is kept as far from Weinstein as possible and Trump even brings Chapman in close for a more intimate but respectable photo. This is a photo of Donald and Melania with Georgina Chapman. Compare that to the likes of Clinton, Lawrence, Streep and Winfrey who slobber and paw at their "God" Harvey.

Hey James Franco, nice #timesup  pin at the #GoldenGlobes , remember a few weeks ago when you told me the full nudity you had me do in two of your movies for $100/day wasn't exploitative because I signed a contract to do it? Times up on that!
