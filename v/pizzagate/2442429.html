            <em>
             [google translated from German]
            </em>
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             The U2 singer Bono is said to be the owner of several letterbox companies - although otherwise he likes to play the pop music Robin Hood.
            </p>
            <p>
             In addition, the "Paradise Papers" reveal that U2 singer Bono also owns part of the Silver Palace in Duisburg. He is said to have invested in 2007 in the company "Nude Estates Limited", which does business across Europe. This company also bought in 2007 the Silver Palace in Duisburg, allegedly for 45 million euros from the German energy company Eon. Bono's shares in the construction should be worth 15 million euros.
            </p>
            <p>
             The seat of the society lies according to Silberpalais website on the British channel island Guernsey. Among others, the steel and metal dealer "KlÃ¶ckner &amp; Co." resides in the building. In 1978, he built the 37,000 square meter building complex, which was then called "Silberburg" because of its shiny metallic design, as the company headquarters for its 1,500 employees. It became a "silver palace" only after the entry of the British.
            </p>
            <p>
             The building was talked about nationwide in the morning of 15 August 2007. At that time, six people were shot in front of the pizzeria "Da Bruno", which was located on the ground floor of the complex near Duisburg central station. Due to its brutality, the case also caused a stir abroad. Background of the act was the feud of two hostile Ndrangheta families.

                Even though he knew he was a pedophile, he still honored him by calling him a national treasure and institution.  That's because he still thought he was.  Amazing.

              There are letters from victims of Clement and they also implicated the wife. That they took the victim into their bed. THEIR bed. So, really. Can we imagine that possibly Emma was abused by her own parents. Something's up with that for sure. Was she possibly wagging her tongue a little too much?

              Both parents of Emma and Matthew Freud were pedophiles. Tell me they did not abuse their own children.

               Here is another Very Interesting Tidbit:  The 16 yrs old boy said about Mrs. Freud. He named her only as â€˜Juneâ€™ and it went on for five years until he met his first wife. June is, of course, the real first name of Jill Freud, and it soon emerged that she was the married women involved.  AND (Incidentally, she is said to have been C. S. Lewisâ€™s inspiration for the character of Lucy in the Narnia stories â€” in World War II she was evacuated to Oxford and was taken in by Lewis and his lover Jane Moore.)    AND in this article from DM there is a picture of BONO and his wife attending the funeral of Clement Freud.  WOW.   By this time he had already been accused and BONO shows up.
