<p>Marvel Charm and Tokyo Doll are both legal studios with adult models, who are legally not allowed to sell their old sets anymore (underage non-nude modelling). All the rest is material from defunct studios that is being flooded onto the web by the world\'s largest distribution network for illegal child content, operating out of Ukraine, jewish by origin and completely secure from persecution by FBI or Interpol.

They work for over 20 years completely undisturbed, with vast network all over Europe, while the the so-called law enforcement agencies are busy busting small fish or shutting down legal studios.

<p>People tend to think that CP is a scary deepweb thing when in reality it\'s literally searchable on bing if you use certain keywords.  It\'s an infinite rabbit hole of interlinking forums, ads, and popups that (((they))) use to profit off of retarded pedos while they navigate the rat maze for a blurry 240p video of an underageb&amp; camgirl from 2006.  I would call it a honeypot but as already said it remains untouched by western intelligence agencies.</p>
<p>It is ALL clearnet but operates on European or other foreign domain names.  The entire operation is based around a spamnet where they make massive amounts of money from this too with BITLY and ADFLY links and premium file hosts. I have no doubts that this has become a multi-million dollar industry since it\'s mostly third worlders like Mexicans, Arabs, Indian, Chinks and Malaysians falling into the bait as well.</p>
<p>If you want to see how helpless you are against the jewish child porn industry, you only have to try to take down the world\'s biggest child porn hub on the clearnet, <a href="https://i.imgtc.com/wwlBTab.png">the &quot;Triforce&quot;</a> (144, 155, 180chan). Do can try to do your best: dox, hack, call law enforcement agencies (record or screenshot the responses), call your local politicians, get public support and see how nothing will take these sites down.  <a href="https://i.imgtc.com/jvfsOqu.png">DO NOT ACTUALLY TRY THESE THINGS, I\'m saying this as a hypothetical to say nothing will happen.</a> Don\'t go to jail for trying.</p>
<p>It\'s easy to find the host countries of the other servers.</p>
<p><a href="https://i.imgtc.com/w70SWiV.png">You can try to report these websites to ALL the authorities in these countries</a>. I am sure these countries have movements for all sorts of things, so alert them that their country is also hosting this fucking shit and refusing to take it down.</p>
<p>180chan.co is hosted on .net and .com, this one is on American soil.</p>
<p>The rest are hosted on .pk .co .cn .se: Pakistan, Colombia, China, Sweden</p>
<p>Most of this info is in the old wikileaks article. Read about the history of image boards. CP was there from the beginning of the web. Since usenet it was an underground community effort, then the big studio takedown happened, which was later uncovered was about jews weaponizing it to strengthen their copyright laws and get full control over the web. Jews, like always controlled both sides of the racket: distribution the illegal content, while using MSM to demonize pedophilia so that the voting public gives their rights away in hopes to do something good for abused children. </p>
<p>The CP distribution network is just a tiny bit of the massive criminal syndicate the khazarian mafia is operating. It comes directly from their prostitution racket, which comes from the human trafficking racket, which is sustained by world poverty (which is believe it or nor a jewish racket to profiteer from endlessly). This entire arm of crime is of course called slavery and dates back to the Caribbean slave trade (started, owned and operated by jews). The whole private island stuff is entirely out of anyone\'s reach and goes deep into religious ritual murder, human sacrifice horrors, and for blackmail purposes. </p>
<p>When CP &quot;gets taken down&quot;m it\'s gone…no. What happens is that old material loses another site of distribution, which springs up endless more sites. That is the direct approach. A more devious law enforcement tool is censorship, which just hides the stuff from the eyes of the ignorant public. None of this helps children in abusive situations in any way and at no point was the source of distribution ever addressed.</p>
<p>Pro-tip: nobody helps these children and everything the jews did only made it way worse for children all around the world.</p>',
