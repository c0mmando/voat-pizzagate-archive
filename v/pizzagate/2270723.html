            Ever seen Evidence of Revision, or parts of it? It's broken into smaller clips now so easier to watch. On youtube. It's six hours I think, below is just part of it, it's about RFK and Jim Jones and mind control. I still haven't watched it yet ... just too much on the web to see. But it's a must see, esp on the Kennedy's.

             No, but will try to keep it in mind ...
Every day I have a larger pile of "Start here" videos ... they take too long.
            </p>
            <p>
             Seemed very strange thing with Roslyn Carter and Jim Jones ... ????
            </p>
            <p>
             Carters still rankle as very odd .... so innocent seeming ... but then ... hmmmm....
Carter knew all about Afghanistan and what Brzezinski was doing.
US/CIA (Catholics in Action) created Taliban/Al Qaeda and US put troops into 
Afghanistan 6 months before the Russians came in ...
and they did it in order to "bait the Russians into Afghanistan ....in hopes of giving
them a Vietnam-type experience."

             Can you give a clue on any part of the RFK/JJ story?

              The whole documentary is filled w/ rare footage and interviews, this particular one I mentioned is on mind control of Sirhan thru hypnosis, and CIA involvement in the Jim Jones fiasco. Not some youtuber's opinion, good stuff.

             Much of the violence we have seen seems to have been carried out by the CIA ....
so that rather than thinking of individuals or small groups involved in fake terrorist murders
like Sharon Tate, or Jonestown, or "Son of Sam" -- or "Zodiac" and many more ....
we have to look behind it and see who was promoting this violence and terror and 
understand that much of this fake violence continues on today disguised as "terrorism."

            <p>
             MUCH OF THIS ... was predicted by Mae Brussel long ago....

             "I am against the planned political assassinations by our intelligence and defense agents.

             Doubles are created to confuse.   The Police Departments manipulate facts in cooperation with conspirators.   I am outraged that our judicial system since 1947 has been patterned after Nazi Germany.   Patsies are dead or locked away.   The assassins walk the streets or leave the country - "home free".   I am against using the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court, Earl Warren, to cover up the assassination of President Kennedy. When the highest court is corrupt, there is no hope at local levels.In a 1988 interview with Conspiracy Digest, Mae was quoted:
