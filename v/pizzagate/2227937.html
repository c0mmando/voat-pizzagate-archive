It is alleged that he is part of a human trafficking operation run out of these top floors and that he might have had a hand in supplying guns to Stephen Paddock. (2) Allegations have been made that the Texas shooter is a member of ANTIFA, the terrorist organization that is funded by George Soros, and that shooting is meant to disarm America.(3) I am taking a guess on what WONDERLAND means.

<p>The question of the hour is how could the last two mass shootings have been accurately predicted? My answer is they couldn\'t. The official stories for both were that the shooters were lone wolves and psychological messes. That would mean nobody but Paddock and Kelley would know what they were going to do, but that isn\'t the case. </p>
<p>MANDALAY was revealed through a YouTube video. The pertinent part related to LV and the shooting starts at 3:18.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVabjG6cKlk&amp;t=200s">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVabjG6cKlk&amp;t=200s</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>How could he have not only gotten LV, but part of Mandalay? He couldn\'t. </p>
<p>Next, the Texas shooting. Here\'s the initial tweet I saw:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/MikeTokes/status/927367068940251136">https://twitter.com/MikeTokes/status/927367068940251136</a></p>
<p>On 11/4/17, an anonymous user on 4chan sent this message accurately predicting todays shooting. What did they know? <a href="https://boards.4chan.org/pol/thread/147857637#p147869196">https://boards.4chan.org/pol/thread/147857637#p147869196</a> …</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When you go to 4chan, you see:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>147857637 (OP)
Watch the news for Texas tomorrow
Something big is coming....</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So there it is ... an accurate prediction, but I didn\'t stop there. I also saw this tweet by Cernovich:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/Cernovich/status/927331467209986048">https://twitter.com/Cernovich/status/927331467209986048</a></p>
<p>Did <a href="https://voat.co/user/CNNPR">@CNNPR</a> radicalize the Texas church shooter?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I was curious about CNN, so I opened up the original tweet, that had a snapshot of Kelley\'s account: </p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/PrisonPlanet/status/927324344228999168">https://twitter.com/PrisonPlanet/status/927324344228999168</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>There is CNN in the left hand column. And right underneath it is this: </p>
<blockquote>
<h1>NANCY FORTIER -- PSYCHIC MEDIUM</h1>
</blockquote>
<p>WTH is Devin Patrick Kelley doing liking a psychic? </p>
<p>It was then something clicked and I wondered: </p>
<p>Does WONDERLAND mean CALIFORNIA? Or is it referring to these strange occult things like psychics, mediums, and tarot cards? </p>
<p>I did look up Nancy Fortier and she is located in CALIFORNIA. PedoWood is also in California. Jim Jones came out of there ... Charles Manson ... so many strange things. </p>
<p>My point? We\'re missing something here. Did the other pages of the shooters have symbology of the occult on the pages? Or were they linked to Wonderland = California?</p>',

              Nothing is happening. Nothing was ever going to happen. A cuckchan LARPer who doesn’t even know how to use a tripcode is not one of the ONLY TEN PEOPLE IN THE FUCKING WORLD with a specific level of security clearance and “full knowledge of this plan.” Someone that important is not posting on 4chan. Someone that important–if he actually has knowledge he wants to disseminate–is also not going to type cryptic bullshit that looks like it came from more than two people and ask questions that he doesn’t answer. Someone that important is, statistically, owned by jews, even if there are some patriots left up there. Out of 10 of the most powerful people in the entire fucking world, the redditors on 4chan expect one of them to not only be “#ourguy”, but to leak the proceedings of FUCKING NATIONWIDE MARTIAL LAW and–surprise surprise–the arrest of three quarters of the US government.
             </p>
             <p>
              Why, that’s exactly what we would want! Happy day! All of our dreams are coming true, and we didn’t even have to put in an ounce of work ourselves! Hooray! It’s over! We’re saved! DON’T QUESTION IT, just spend the entire day ignoring literally everything else that is ACTUALLY happening in the news, never mind your own wildly successful campaign of “It’s okay to be white.” Because nothing ever came from YOU doing an honest day’s work!

Where’s the martial law? Where are the riots he talked about? Antifa couldn’t even get off their asses for a completely unrelated outing. Where’s the Huma arrest? Where are the Podesta arrests? They were supposed to be in custody by now; no one has any information on that beyond your continued shilling campaign. WHERE IS ANY MENTION OF JEWS, WHATSOEVER, IN ANYTHING THAT HE WROTE? Why is he a CIVIC NATIONALIST? Nothing he said has happened.

               You've made some good points. It's not even that I disagree with them. As for everything coming to pass, I wouldn't go that far. But to be fair, wouldn't you say that the White House Anon had inside knowledge? I believe

               only posted a couple of times and was correct. And I'm mystified how the YouTuber not only called the place of the next false flag accurately, but doubled up by hinting at Mandalay. Now if he somehow substituted a video with that one that had a September date, then that would satisfy me a to how it was done, but there's no proof that was accomplished.

               In terms of where someone would post, I know this guy who worked at a consulting firm in the 90s. Tensions were tight and lo and behold a fellow employee told him the exact date and time of the start of Desert Storm (think that was what it was called). He thought what you did that a putz like the guy he worked with would have no way of knowing anything. He laughed it off, but sure enough the next day, tick tock KABOOM. It started on the exact day and time that was said. This by way of saying, you don't know who someone will tell ... or why. Maybe they want to taunt somebody. Maybe they want to brag. They may even want to scare someone. Who knows, but the point is sometimes people know things. Sometimes they work in IT, sometimes they overhear things. sometimes they're so far down on the totem pole that bigwigs openly discuss things thinking that the peon in the room wouldn't even have anybody to tell such a big secret to.

               Thanks for explaining. When everybody's reading a post and responding and milling about for a couple of days and then there's somebody shouting about LARPERS and shit, I get curious about what set them off.

               Like I said, I get what you're saying ... not agreeing with everything, but what the hey? And, no, we don't just sit back ... ever!!!! It's what got us into this mess. It's why I constantly tell people to get involved, run for political office or volunteer. Keep up on legislation and fight, fight, fight it if it's anything to do with this NWO normalizing pedophilia shit so we definitely have a meeting of the minds there.

                One of TEN people in the entire fucking world who would know about an operation to declare martial law and arrest 70% of the federal government for treason would not anonymously post on fucking 4chan. If he was trying to reassure people, he would not post in the way this guy posted. If he was trying to scare people, he would not post at all (because he’d be going after /pol/ and its denizens). It just doesn’t fucking add up.

            What you all should check out is the Maroon 5 music video that came out 3 or 4 days before the Vegas shooting. It includes a vegas shooting!!! also Maroon 5 has a concert planned at Mandalay Bay on new years eve this year called the "red pill blues". I'm not sure how much of this is synchronicity and how much of it is intentional (predictive programming or whatever theory there is, perhaps part of some occult ritual, having to show hints of the truth in pop media)

            the vegas part starts at 2 minutes in. before that is some weird communist imagery in LA during an Olympics event in a track and field stadium. also notice the monarch butterflies in the first part of the video. and it ends with a big shooting on the vegas strip.

             You never know about people and what they know.  I always wondered about Levine. Seemed to be paying homage to satanists. Have no idea why I thought that, but it was the impression I got. Maybe he was only making nice-nice because of the business he was in.

              I don't know much about Maroon 5 or Adam Levine, since I don't watch TV or listen to that kind of music. But unfortunately its very catchy pop music. I only found out about the music video from a 4chan post and honestly I didn't believe it until I saw it. The director is Joesph Kahn who does a lot of illuminati style pop star music videos for all the big stars. I am probably missing a lot but in the music video there are monarch butterflies, the communist tanks and jets in Los Angeles, the dolphins and underwater scene, then the vegas indoor gambling scene which leads to the outdoor scene which has the shooting. the 5 adult "boy scouts" are either scout masters or its symbolism maybe for special forces, as boy scout is sometimes used as a nick name for special forces, as they are loyal and very well trained.

            There were the "Wonderland" murders in the Los Angeles hills. They made a movie about it too. Don't know if everything was ever revealed either in the book or the film. Lots of players, drug deals gone bad,  players with very polluted brains, porno stars dead, organized crime connections, money stolen, endless arguments over who owed what and who paid, snitches and endless lies.

            Notice how the pedo mods leave these unrelated threads up for a long time, but my account was banned for posting a well done documentary about the pope and the Catholic churge holocost against the aboriginal people in Canada? Witness talking about the torture and sexual abuse and my video was ripped down in minutes. I reposted several times and was banned by the pedo mods. Weinstein post and shooting hoax stays up. We need to oust the pdeo protecting mods like Vindicator and MF.

             Sorry. It sounds like background. But there's also what the church did to Native American children in the States, and what Australia did against children. There's been a war going on for quite some time and the children were the victims.

             I vaguely recall having read lately that Britain has a large influence in the US through the CIA, but I could be wrong.

             It was someone's guess, but think about it ... and I didn't raise the following point but .... re: psychics (not this particular psychic because I do not want to make allegations about her that are untrue), or those daily horoscopes on websites, what better way to pass along someone's trigger word ... if a trigger word is being used. That also was suggested. That Alice *In" Wonderland was a trigger word hinting that one might be used before these incidents. If not trigger words, instructions. It would be the perfect place to leave instructions without actual communication with whoever is paying for this shit.

            Wonderland was also the title of a pedo ring that was allegedly busted in 2015. These things never die, they just get put on pause and reshuffled.

            Alice is a mind control victim and Wonderland is the false narrative these revisionists have been creating for us. This is the clearest allegory from personal experience. The author (Carroll) is a known pedophile and likely a member of the revisionist culture.

             This is a different take on things. PedoWood is in California and it is central to pedophilia ... it's the home of the cabal and movies. Movies are in themselves a kind of Wonderland.

              I can only reply a few times a day (no points new account). Wonderland is America. We're about to wake up to what the revisionists have been doing in the deep state. First Bin Talal is removed by the King (whose first act was to kill a pedo) in exchange for aid in the takedown of the caliphate members in Saudi Arabia and open trade (no more harmful  real estate umbrella investments) on the NYSE. Now our government will be cleaned up, most likely also under martial law as is Saudi Arabia right now. POTUS is in Asia assuring that trade agreements can be fair once again, and that our alliance with this evil HIVITE culture will end. China free trade is upcoming. Welcome to Wonderland.

               Okay, so that is the most optimistic opinion ever. Gotta give you an UpVoat for getting me off the couch and moving again.
              </p>
              <p>
               I think Wonderland had the utmost sinister implications ever. Hence, it's California ... specifically, Laurel Canyon. But the transforming of it into a Uptopian society ... me likes and it's a pretty good endgame.

               I pray you're right. Hope you stick around and hope this gets you lots of CCP's!!!!

                Fox News is slowly rolling out the most important news story any of you will ever learn of.
               </p>
               <p>
                Prince bin Talal was paying for our presidents through bribing our political elites to get Obama elected. He even paid for Obama's Harvard education.
               </p>
               <p>
                When Hillary offered to do the same, but couldn't deliver, she owed bin Talal all his contributions back. Obama sent funds to Iran before leaving office to repay the bribes. Those funds ended up in various locations funding ISIS.
               </p>
               <p>
                When Trump visited Saudi Arabia (first stop as POTUS) he was given a King's welcome, unique among past presidents. This is because the King hates this pedophile caliphate and Trump offered aid to remove bin Talal and open trade on the NYSE. This eliminates the need for harmful umbrella real estate deals currently the only option for Saudi wealth.
               </p>
               <p>
                Now that bin Talal is in custody he will be brought here and his information will take down HRC, Obama, both Bush presidents and many, many others.
               </p>
               <p>
                This is absolutely enormous.
               </p>
               <p>
                Trump is in Asia right now assuring Japan that we will retaliate against North Korea if they strike Japan. This opens up more free trade in exchange. China free trade is on the horizon. These were tools to punish nations not bowing down to this Hivite caliphate.
               </p>
               <p>
                We have been subtly (and not so subtly) mind controlled through media moguls owned by this caliphate. They revise events and narratives to their means and have been deep stating governments for a looooooooong time. Think ancient Phoenicia. This culture practiced ritual baby sacrifice and child prostitution, as well the use of prostitution to compromise officials. Sound familiar? Their family systems are insanely difficult to break out of as they abuse the children brutally and divide the mind into dissociated states. Notice how many pop culture shows have lately delved into mind control, etc? The NSA is using counter tactics in entertainment to help slowly wake us up to this. It's going to hurt going down. Biggest red pill ever.

                  It's because we are both survivor of this cult and have actual insider knowledge of these things. You all have been so close so many times to the fundamental, underlying truth. We are both so excited to be able to give you these additional skeleton keys to break it all down. Voat, 4Chan, the citizen investigators and truth warriors are on the front lines of a psyops war that's been waged against humanity for more than 6000 years! We can END IT NOW with your help! KEEP PUSHING!!!

             I've read about the Alice In Wonderland methods, it does exist,  but I don't see how it relates to anything specific going on right now, other than a general reference to all the general mindfuckery involved in all they do and say.

              The NSA wants the whole thing exposed. If you look at what they've done to social media and our entertainment media, it's insanely mind controlling. Too many people are finding themselves aligning with their concepts and not even knowing it. This is by design. If we stop at HRC and her coup attempt, the Wonderland will continue. Remember these people have created civilization and all of its traps: convenience traps, the concept of ego, false dilemma fallacies, the list goes on and on. If we can finally recognize how important it is to share information in real-time and wake enough of our fellow people up, this will finally end. As a survivor, sovereignty means something incredibly profound. My choice to act in life is now my own, whereas before I didn't know that the women I would fall in love with were paid actors placed there for me to serve. Trump is attempting to free the Nation from this mind control as well, meta sovereignty. If we get really good at spreading this information, the whole WORLD can reintegrate and for ONCE be free to live of our own accord.

               You are so off on this. The Clintons did not attempt a coup because the country has long since been taken over. Listen to Myron Fagan from the 50's talk about America already being subverted by the Council on Foreign Relations(Illiminati) and the Satanic plot to enslave the world. Hillary is a henchman. The idea that the country is corrupt but the government legit except for Hillary trying to overthrow the legit government is a limted hangout that you are spreading. The NSA is the surveilance state more than the CIA. You have been had. It never stops in here. The entire government was complicit to treason on 9/11 and was taken over long before that. Hillary coup was some BS from the likes of Spook Steve Picenik. You are spreading blatant lies.

                Bin Talal paid for HRC presidency and didn't get it. Obama repaid through funding ISIS. Hillary had a Q level clearance and knew about/contributed towards this mass mind control of our culture. Bezos probably has the codes to NK nukes, which is why Trump just assured Abe (unofficially) to retaliate if NK strikes Japan. Welcome to Wonderland everyone. #PhoeniciaisFalling

               whenever i give someone irrefutable proof of something that doesn't fit their current view of the world, all i get back is the thousand yard stare.  It literally keys in a zombie brain freeze. Whatever they have done to people,  they did it well.

             And look at the legislation they've passed recently. It's legal for AIDs patients to KNOWINGLY give blood. Possessors of CP will now be dropped from sex registries after ten years. No life sentences for pedophiles. And the legalization of teenage prostitution.

               I believe Area 51 is known as "Paradise Ranch" as well as "Dreamland" but I'm not an expert. Wonderland I haven't heard of that one, I'd assume an Alice in Wonderland connection.

               What you all should check out is the Maroon 5 music video that came out 3 or 4 days before the Vegas shooting. It includes a vegas shooting!!! also Maroon 5 has a concert planned at Mandalay Bay on new years eve this year called the "red pill blues". I'm not sure how much of this is synchronicity and how much of it is intentional (predictive programming or whatever theory there is, perhaps part of some occult ritual, having to show hints of the truth in pop media)

               the vegas part starts at 2 minutes in. before that is some weird communist imagery in LA during an Olympics event in a track and field stadium. also notice the monarch butterflies in the first part of the video. and it ends with a big shooting on the vegas strip.
