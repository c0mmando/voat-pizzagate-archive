<p>There’s a transcription of a pre-production story meeting for the first Indiana Jones film that is fascinating. The Raiders of the Lost Ark story meeting is between George Lucas, Steven Spielberg, and Lawrence Kasdan and if you read it, you literally are a witness to the birth of Indiana Jones.</p>
<p>Not only do you get to see how they work out the story and characters, you get to see things that were nuggets that were used in Temple of Doom and there’s some shades of Last Crusade. The biggest highlight from this transcription is the weirdo request by Lucas to have Indiana Jones bang a twelve year old Marion in his past.</p>
<p>Indiana_Jones_StoryMeeting_1</p>
<pre><code>George Lucas: I was thinking that this old guy could have been his mentor. He could have known this little girl when she was just a kid. Had an affair with her when she was eleven.

Lawrence Kasdan: And he was forty-two.

George Lucas: He hasn’t seen her in twelve years. Now she’s twenty-two. It’s a real strange relationship.

Steven Spielberg: She had better be older than twenty-two.

George Lucas: He’s thirty-five, and he knew her ten years ago when he was twenty-five and she was only twelve. It would be amusing to make her slightly young at the time.

Steven Spielberg: And promiscuous. She came onto him.

George Lucas: Fifteen is right on the edge. I know it’s an outrageous idea, but it is interesting. Once she’s sixteen or seventeen it’s not interesting anymore. But if she was fifteen and he was twenty-five and they actually had an affair the last time they met. And she was madly in love with him and he…
</code></pre>

<p>Egad! A sexual relationship between a twenty five year old and a sixteen or seventeen year old is not interesting? I realize that age differences like this weren’t as big of a deal in the ’30s, but it’s strange how Mr. Lucas is focused on this. What makes this more creepy is the huge age difference found in the Star Wars prequels.</p>
<p>Now the ages probably were 25 and 16, judging by Harrison Ford’s and Karen Allen’s age during the filming of the movie (they’re exactly 9 years apart), if that’s anything to go by. Still, the original idea of a 42 year old banging a 12 year old is fucking creeptastic.</p>
<p>You can get the story meeting transcript here. I’ve started reading the rest and it’s pretty interesting stuff.</p>',

            Should add that Lucas is married to Melody Barnes who is very close to the Obamas.  Didn't Lucas try to grab some land in Chicago for some museum?

            Speilberg and the Clintons go WAY BACK. from Wikipedia:
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             Clinton eventually moved to Texas with Rodham in 1972 to take a job leading George McGovern's effort there. He spent considerable time in Dallas, at the campaign's local headquarters on Lemmon Avenue, where he had an office. Clinton worked with future two-term mayor of Dallas Ron Kirk,[32] future governor of Texas Ann Richards,[33] and then unknown television director (and future filmmaker) Steven Spielberg.[34]

             I looked at a ton of these.  Here is something interesting I copied
             <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-4958816/Don-Jr-dares-Oscars-host-Jimmy-Kimmel-slam-Weinstein.html">
              http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-4958816/Don-Jr-dares-Oscars-host-Jimmy-Kimmel-slam-Weinstein.html
             </a>
             Don Jr  dared Kimmel to speak out about Weinstein.  Who.  Kimmel is the one that had that skit on his show with Ron Howard and  another actor (Tom Somebody) and they proceeded to dress up their daughters as Sexy Princess Ballerinas  there is a video but I can't find it right now.  Maybe Don knows something?

              Please try to link that video. I knew Streep was with Wienstien as a partner in his debauchery,  but I really wanted Zelwegger to not be a part of this. Should have known from the John Carry film. Prepare yourself for everyone you admired in media and other to be exposed.Randy Quaid is sounding saner by the day.

                When I first saw that video I was sick to my stomach! It was around that time I stopped watching movies. I liked Tom Hanks before that but something was off about the whole thing. I found it extremely creepy.

                 Yes, and Oh how I loved Opie on Andy Griffith and Tom in Polar Express.  We just love it.  We loved the song Hot Chocolate and I would always make Popcorn and Hot Chocolate when we watched it.  Now it just makes me sick.  It reminds me a little of JonBenet.  And that makes me sicker.
