            ..A Shiva Temple....Quote: TIL of the "Satanic verses" 'incident', The name given to the occasion on which the Islamic Prophet Muhammad is said to have mistaken the words of "satanic suggestion" for divine revelation.

            Muslims feel they have a religious duty to kill and rid the world of anything opposing them. Their license is through Muhammad, who according to this, was manipulated by evil forces, or satan. If this is true then all true muslims live their lives in the images of satan. Not far-fetched or hard to believe as most people consider killing a negative action. The kabba and mecca connected?

            Deleted A link between Allah and Moloch? is MOLECH an old spelling of Moloch?... Moloch (Molech) or Baal was the ancient 'Moon God' of the Bedouin Arab tribes into which Muhammad was born. Muhammad modelled Allah on the Moon God of the desert and on the Christian God. Baphomet, the horned devil god worshipped by some sects of Satanists is another manifestation of the old moon god. Notice how the moon and star are depicted in a drawing of Baphomet. The moon and star are also part of the Comet Ping Pong signage above the entrance, and of course the moon and star represent Islam.

            Muhammad never had an advisor. Any thing close to that was the arc angel Gabriel. Islamic is the branch from Abraham: Isaac is Judaic &amp; Ishmael is Islamic. Christianity is HELLAGENIC, thanks to the few bad influential Jews that were paying homage to HELLAGENIC SOCIETY.  Judaic Believers called themselves "Muslim"; Arabic word for, submission to God. Christianity Believers also called themselves "Muslim" when Muhammad and Other were giving revelations, and "Christians" recognized the Word, and Christians seek truth, if God allowed their individual availing in the heart to happen. God doesn't open a person eyes if that person won't help himself to understand.  Fyi, the word Qur'an Is Arabic for, READ.

             This 'Gabriel' in their so called does NOT exist, the guy was an insane madman who suffered fits....most religion is a mix of lies, history and mythology. Muhammad was an illiterate war mongering slaver and pedophile who could not read or write and yet people say he wrote the Koran, the god al-Lah is in fact a Moongod from Hindu Vedic and Babylon times

              Ok, he did not write the Qur'an, God sent "light" to Gabriel, to bring to Muhammad in the form of pappers, called surahs, English word as in 'versus. And yes, Muhammad was illiterate and that was proof he didn't write it but copied it. And unbelievers would say he wrote it. But he didn't. He was a teacher in a form of a messenger. Just like every other prophet. And prophet doesn't mean your some seer or Jessu, Elijah, Moses. You are ONLY A MESSAGE WITH SINGS. Everything I have said comes from the Qur'an.....READ

            Khadijah had a cousin named Waraquah,, who was also a very faithful Roman Catholic and the Vatican placed him in a critical role as Muhammad's advisor...the pedophile terroristic prophet who founded islam 1400 yrs ago as described in the Quran or Koran... more info Pope Francis: "It isn't right to say that Islam is a terrorist faith" - YouTube

            The Vatican is not oblivious to the declared ambitions of Islamists. The Vatican recognizes in Islam a challenge of civilization-size dimension, a rival true-believer which also lays claim to universality. You do not need to be Catholic to grasp the ironic similarities. Both the late author, Oriana Fallaci, former President of the Italian Senate, and Middle East Scholar Bernard Lewis understood this. Princeton Professor Emeritus Lewis, who was an occasional guest of Pope John Paul II at Castel Gandolfo, the summer residence of the Popes, pointedly asserts that the interests of both Christianity and Islam will continuously "intersect" -- that is, clash -- as both have universal missions
