There was at least one member of the British Establishment who was a customer of this child sexual abuse/exploitation ring; Richard Maurice Clive Bigham, or to give him his proper title, Master of Nairn, Viscount Mersey.  Like Spielman, Viscount Mersey was a member of the Paedophile Information Exchange.  In 1977, Spielman procured two girls, aged 6 and 10, for Mersey to abuse (even more sickeningly, this was done with the consent of the children\'s mother, Victoria Hughes).  Mersey travelled to the Hughes home where he abused the elder child whilst Spielman photographed the abuse.  When they were tried and convicted in 1978, Hughes and Spielman received jail sentences of 4 and 6 years respectively, yet Mersey, despite being an admitted paedophile, a member of PIE and having confessed to abusing another child on a previous occasion, escaped with a 12 month suspended sentence.  The year after the trial, Mersey entered the House of Lords where he remained an active peer until 1999.</p>

            Great find Podge512
In the newspaper report Richard Bigham was married at Christ Church, Hampstead!!!
            <strong>
             ALARM BELLS
            </strong>
            this is the same church that the HAMPSTEAD COVER-UP is accusing of being used for Satanic Ritual Abuse, and this is where he chose to get married back in
            <strong>
             1961
            </strong>
            This agrees with all the different accusations about abuse going on around that area for decades, and obviously more recently, 2014, those poor children Alisas police testimony -

             https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSJI_qfI-es
            </a>
            There IS something going on there and its been for years imo!
           </p>
           <p>
            RICHARD MAURICE CLIVE BIGHAM
           </p>
           <p>
            Bigham, who described himself as “a documentary film technician, interested in paedophilia on a photographic level only” was the eldest son of Viscount Mersey, whose title he inherited following his father’s death on 1st August 1979.  He married Joanna Murray at **
            <em>
             Christ Church, Hampstead
            </em>
            **, in 1961 and they lived with their children at 1 Rosmead Road in Notting Hill.
           </p>
           <p>
            Despite his membership of PIE, conviction for child abuse and admission of his sexual attraction to children, just a year later he was able to sit in the House of Lords, where he continued to be active until 1999.  Yet another paedophile connected to Westminster.
