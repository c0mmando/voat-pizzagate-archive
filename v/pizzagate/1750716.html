            The real official narrative is to oversimplify it to the point where the story became JA was selling kids "out of the basement" of comet ping pong. Since there is no basement, and no surviving victims have come forward yet, it paints a silly "fake news" picture. "Who could fall for such a nonsense story?" is the challenge directed at the clueless viewers.
           </p>

            A magician uses distraction (sleight of hand) to move the audience's attention away from where the trick is.
           </p>
           <p>
            The point of focus here should also include the podestas imo, we know JA is dirty and will fall when it all happens, and surely something wrong is happening at the "pegasus museum," but focusing purely on JA is tough because he's a made man and covers his tracks as fast as we can uncover them. He's a wiggly-worm and won't get away, but let's not lose site of the podesta molesta's either, they are just as creepy and it would be nice to see some "heat" directed at them as well.
            <strong>
             Those "Wanted" pics in the Madeline McCann case should be printed and posted everywhere in DC and across the nation, on every twitter account facebook page etc until they can no longer appear in public without being heckled to oblivion.
            </strong>
            Just my two cents, it was never debunked an abbreviated version was cooked up and served to keep people from looking at the leaked e-mails and instagram pics.

            It  wasn't debunked, do you  want somebody on this thread to  make  a case that it is? Do you not know what the MSM is? If you do, why ask why  they  keep saying  this? Confused about  how propaganda  works?

            Debunked?  The media refuses to even show any of the evidence/proof for the simple reason that it is all too damning and any sane person looking at it would conclude what everyone here concluded. Thankfully the media spent their last few pennies of credibility in the last Presidential election, so the natural mental reaction to anything they say is that probably the opposite is true.  The more they shine light on this topic, the more people will look to see for themselves, and that is exactly what we want and what they surely don't want.

            hey - wait - I know....    60 Minutes said it was debunked because    when the gunman went in, he didn't find little children tied up inside.
           </p>
           <p>
            that is the reason it is debunked.   now do you see how smart they are?  we must be wrong.

             Don't you love it?  60 Minutes cites Edgar Maddison Welch as their source as confirming nothing nefarious was happening at CPP.  Oh, and snag that hard drive while you're in there Eddy.

            There has been censorship. Archives have been taken down. Wikileaks showed collusion between dems and MSM. Fake news campaign. Even the pope commented.  Ben Swann weirdness. Milo dropped his talk on it. Assange weirdness. Alex Jones weirdness.

            Actually it first started with political activists who were SURE the emails hid sinisters acts and anonymous political LARPERs who primed these activists who already were deeply, deeply conspiratorial.  It was only after these political actors primed the pot, did any creepy coincidences start.  And what do you know, the deeper you looked, sinister acts did pop out.  All you had to do was change the meaning of ambiguous sentences into sinister code and voila, malefeasance!
           </p>
           <p>
            The series and pattern you describe is a very familiar series of cognitive processes that involve, tunnel vision, confirmation bias and not giving the benefit of the doubt to an extreme, to the point where people's humanity is denied and people are demonized.
           </p>
           <p>
            Folks who knew of Marina Abramovic before last summer, knew she was provocative performance artist.  She may or may not be to your taste, but she was a genuine artist and respected by serious and sincere people. I don't assume her fans are Satanists.  Any more than I assume the fans of AC/DC are Satanists.  Any more than I assume Anthony Hopkins or Thomas are serial killers.
           </p>
           <p>
            Politics and Tribalism are two of the most powerful emotional/anti-rational forces we have.  If you wanted to pick two things that would make people deny the humanity of people on the side of these issues, it would be hard to pick two more powerful agents.  Religion (which informs both political and tribalism, might be the only thing more powerful.)

            You're right, it hasn't. Not one single question asking to explain the bizarre social media posts, not one follow up proving that Caris James exists.
           </p>
           <p>
            You would think the parents of Caris would want to help clear JA's name quickly by coming forward and proving that Caris is fine and healthy.
           </p>
           <p>
            That alone signals there is fire behind the smoke.

             Later he's been telling a non-claim doesn't need to be argued etc. Not sure if he ever took one claim to argue on, seems to me he's addressing more the claims towards himself.

            It has not been even close to debunked. Rather, claims like "Hillary is chopping up babies in a basement of a pizza restaurant" were falsely attributed to us and then those claims were attacked.
           </p>
           <p>
            None of the media outlets saying it has been "debunked" will show you the archives of all of the pictures that James Alefantis uploaded onto his instragram which show allusions to child abuse. They will not show you his avatar which is a direct reference to pedophilia, or the many photos of his friends sexualizing "pizza".
           </p>
           <p>
            They will not tell you that Laura Silsby served a jail sentence for kidnapping 33 black children and now works with AlertSense which distributes Amber Alerts.
           </p>
           <p>
            They will not tell you that Silsby's legal defender had a warrant out for his arrest for human trafficking.
           </p>
           <p>
            They will not show you the abused children in Tony Podesta's collected art, nor tell you that Podesta and Alefantis are friends, nor tell you that Podesta is close friends with convicted pedophile Denis Hastert, etc. etc.
           </p>
           <p>
            Instead they pin the most ludicrous claims on us and attack those claims -- they are attacking strawmen and shouting "debunked!" from the rooftops to create the illusion that there's nothing to see here.

             This reminds me of George Webb stating a couple of times that people get ground up into Alpo ....the way the mob used to get rid of people. He stated that on 2 diff occasions and that it occured in the underground DC tunnels. Still have a hard time believing that one but he's been right on almost everything else....but still, not sure I completely trust him.

              Disclaimer: We MK'd have two trains of reality in our memories, at least.  Speaking from my experience that only returned to fuller consciousness after 4 decades, with a slow gradual bang and nothing verifiable,....just, for me alone, a solid sense of "It was real", Yes to DC tunnels, Dupont Circle SA kids, and certainly the constant threat of being sent to a pig farm as food.  While your drugged with those "your going to forget all this" pills, they feel free and even a compulsion to explain themselves.
             </p>
             <p>
              That G Webb seemingly shows no emotion, God Bless him for the stamina to keep at it.  He must feel it way deeper than shows.  I've known strong headed men like that.  Not many around now.  We need them.   Stick together people.

                Thanks for replying.  I don't know how to do a message to someone, now I know it's possible, just one more online skill to master.  I'm thinking this goes directly rather than posting.
                <br/>
                I can't listen to all of what Webb posts, it's too much for me, the density.  But real research is all dull reading, in video or print.
                <br/>
                He is leaving a strong wake that will last over time, I think.

            It's more that Pizzagate has never come close to proving a single thing.
           </p>
           <p>
            At its core pizzagate makes a claim that John Podesta used coded language in his emails to hide pedophilia which then became human trafficking which then became Satanic ritual abuse which then became Cannibalism and so on and so on.  (Have you heard about the pig farms?)  Then people started looping in every single other case they could find and claiming it's a single ring and is part of an elite conspiracy going back generations.
           </p>
           <p>
            None of this makes any sense to someone who doesn't already hate Hillary Clinton AND have deeply held beliefs in preexisting elite conspiracies.
           </p>
           <p>
            You don't have to do anything to debunk it.  The term I used is Prebunked.
           </p>
           <p>
            People started making outrageous claims or outright lies about the emails and these quickly became accepted as fact.  For example, you make the claim EMW was a hired actor.  Surely you know, there's no proof of that correct?  It's a story pizzagaters have told themselves and the deeply believe it.......see preexisting conspiracy theories above.....but the evidence they have is tissue paper thin.  Folks think they can make a bunch of connections of tissue paper thin pieces of evidence and built a 100 grade battleship chain out of tissue.  But upon the slightest examination the whole thing falls apart.
           </p>
           <p>
            Pizzagaters have shown absolutely zero instances of coded messages in Joh Podesta emails.  Some meanings are unknown.  Some of the code highlighted by pizzagaters is demonstrably false.
           </p>
           <p>
            If you want to point to any code, I'll give my thoughts.
           </p>
           <p>
            We are all prone to confirmation bias and conspiratorial thinking and making more of random coincidence than we should.  It's how the human brain works.  You need to be on guard and practice checking your thinking if you don't want to fall for a false story you are telling yourself, not the real story.   Our brains love storytelling and when we see gaps or ambiguity, we can creative narrative links that seems to make sense and seem to hold everything together, but we are really just kidding ourselves.
           </p>
           <p>
            Basically if are not a person prone to the confirmation biases inherent in the pizzagate origin story, the whole thing sounds ridiculous.

            Note: Please understand I'm not going to respond to a Gish Gallop of evidence. I'm not interested how long a chain you made.   I would like to go back to the very beginning to take individual links from the emails and see if the pizzagate assertions about them amount to anything.   Another issue with this is folks determined to make Podesta look bad will be ultra-literal in reading of evidence.   To someone who doesn't have that confirmation bias, basic reading comprehension would tell you this is not being used literally.

            <p>
             It's that the symbol that was picked was used in coded language, pizza, 
More importanly, these symbols existed before pedophile adopted them and the symbols are fairly common graphic eleements and the "code words" are exceedingly common.  You then have the giant, giant hurdle of showing that people using the word pizza or a spiral motif even know about the existence of this code, let alone are using that code.   Am I supposed to stop using the word pizza because idiots on 4chan adopted it?

When did Hillary visit Comet Ping Pong?  This is an unproven assertion.  Comet Ping Pong held a political fundraiser for her.  But anybody can do that.  It doesn't mean the politician is going to show up.  The Podesta emails show Podesta wasn't even going to attend.  I contend the bit about Alefantis's "power" is an overly literal reading of a fluff magazine piece.  I believe a pair of party planners was also on that list.

            Congrats on acknowledging this is a theory based on circumstantial evidence.  Too few people acknowledge that.  Despite that people refer to Clinton, Podesta, Alefantis, et al definitely as child molesters, criminals, traffickers etc.  This is what I think the press refers to when they said debunked.

            There's zero evidence EMW did not act out of his own volition.  Zero evidence anyone hired him.  The story that he was a paid actor started almost immediately based on preexisting conspiratorial beliefs.  Government run false-flags are so commonly discussed as to be a cliche.  It's template you can put on any event, a template you can use without a single bit of evidence EMW chose to do what he did.

            For many people this is also about their Anti-Mason or Anti Illuminati or anti-NWO anti-government or anti-MSM media beliefs.  The idea of dropping the nonsense with the weak evidence and focusing energy on genuine human trafficking that is out there is anathema to them.  It would threaten their beliefs.  If you gave them the chance to actually help children, but they had to recognize the truth, that they were mislead about Podesta or Alefantis, they would never take it.   Helping children simply wouldn't be enough for them.

            I don't.  You don't.  But so what?  This proves absolutely nothing.  Perhaps Tony Podesta does talk that way.  You have no baseline for comparison.  You have no clue how he speaks.  FBI investigators are trained that when you interview someone and their knees are shaking and they can't look you in the eye that DOES NOT prove deceptive behavior.  Because you have to first find out how the person regularly behaves.  They are trained to ask a series of neutral questions before any accusatory questions and notice
            <em>
             changes
            </em>
            in behavior.  Because you as an outsider find something strange doesn't equal this is coded talk.  The love to get a pizza for an hour thing has never bothered me at all because John Podesta has a crammed schedule.  I've always read this as equivalent, "can you get away for an hour to grab lunch?"  And pizza is a meal you can do in an hour.

            Do you know the actual story about that?   It's a completely appropriate what Podesta says and a very human response.    Frankly, this to me is a test if you are approaching this story rationally.  The two women in the photo are Euna Lee and Laura Ling, reporters working a story about North Korean defectors.  They were working on the Chinese side of the border.  They got a tip from a source that he could give them a scoop.  In reality, he was double-crossing them to North Korea.  He convinced them to go with him across the border to North Korea.  Once they did they were arrested.  The girl in the photo is Euna Lee's daughter.  They had just been released from 140 days of captivity in a North Korean prison.  I believe that photo was the first time the two reporters got together back in the US.  They were home, free and eating pizza with their family.  I ask you, person to person, does it get any better than that?

             I completely disagree with that.  The folks who I learned about pizzagate from were absolutely gleeful about it mainly due to political reasons.  Also think of all the folks on here who want their worldview validated who want people to be "redpilled."

              Further, if you're so sure then go collect your $50,000 reward from the pizzagate.com website. Why not not go through the sourced material in detail and debunk it yourself listing off your reasons and explanations for all the points? 
Because they would never pay me.   I made a thread on that here.  They don't actually make a series of factual claims.  They make a series of their opinions which are undebunkable.  For example, I don't deny there's a picture of a girl with masking tape on JA's instagram.   I deny their conclusion which that is evidence of abuse.   To me the girl looks very happy.  They have some things are falsifiable, but very few.  One of the is Louise Bourgeois's sculpture the Arch of Hysteria is absolutely not inspired by Jeffrey Dahmer.  The Dahmer case happened before she made the statue, but the crime scene photos were not released at that time.  They were leaked years later.  She has also been quite clear of what her inspiration was.  Also that is one of a series she did.  I believe the first one was done before the Dahmer case.....can't definitely say this, but a lot of her work that was in the exhibition where they Arches of Hysteria debuted was conceived of years earlier.

              You conveniently don't mention some of the obvious strange connections such as Laura Silsby or the sketches of the Podesta brothers in the McCann case and so on.

            <p>
             I don't.  Like I said this is from outside the Podesta emails.  Does he mention Silsby?  Maybe he does.  However, I have seen zero evidence that Hillary Clinton knew who she was prior to her being arrested.  I never saw her as a sex trafficker/organ seller and still don't.  I've always viewed Silsby as Christian Missionary wacko type.
            </p>
            <p>
             The sketches are totally weird.  However, the police say BOTH sketches are supposed to be the same man a man between 20 and 40 years old.   They have said that on the day the sketches came out.
            </p>
            <p>
             Also both of these are very common features of conspiratorial thinking called anomaly hunting.   It's focusing on the weird details at the expense of the whole.  If you want to ignore the fact that neither John nor Tony Podesta could be confused for being 20 years old at the time of her kidnapping, this may become more significant for you.

             AreWeSure, your previous posts (especially the ones with an extreme amount of negative votes) make me wonder why you're on here. You speculate everything which is fine but I just went through almost all of your previous comments and you rarely ever(if at all cause I didn't read all of them) believe pizzagate to be true. With a name like that and all of these negative comments with poor votes...why are you here? Also...
            </p>
            <p>
             If you're discussing pizzagate not having any decent proof...Here's why Hillary, Podesta and Alefantis are all potentially involved in something pure evil.
            </p>
            <p>
             Alefantis is great friends with Michael Maccoby whose son is a director of friends of the orphans, the charity Laura Silsby was given children from(for child trafficking). Max Maccoby, director of friends of the orphans, also represented James alefantis and David Brock for a $850,000 blackmail case (I'll link with all the info). Alefantis had several strange photos of children on his Instagram(there's more to the story than just this), he's close friends with the Podesta brother (the brothers who love child torture and morbid art so much that they put it up in their homes), hosts private political party's, has rock bands that almost blatantly promote pedophilia play at some of these private events. Heck, even former D.C. Councilman Frank Winstead accused Alefantis of this in 2008. He's a small piece in a giant ring of potential pedophiles.
            </p>
            <p>
             Prove this info wrong and I'll leave you be.
            </p>
            <p>
             Oh and here.

            <p>
             Also...you know you're on to something when bots start appearing with the same messages.

             Isn't it weird how people keep making accounts with your name in different variants posting the same photo and message?
            </p>
            <p>
             This has happened in other governments.

            <p>
             And since Podesta received strange emails such as

             And this same lady that offered her children also offered their services on this website

            <p>
             Podesta's brother, Tony Podesta(hillarys potential Secretary of State brother and close ally)also mentions a torture room in a Wikileaks email.
             <a href="https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/56492">

             They both own art of children being tortured and rape.

            </p>
            <p>
             And how are Podesta and Alefantis tied together in this Pizzagate discussion? The New York Times calls them friends. Both own art containing pedophilia, murder and cannibalism. Alefantis Instagram photos are riddled with images of children, jokes of murder and selling kids. He even posted an image of a guy with a baby calling him a chicken lover.

               Obviously? I missed the part where this was explained further as just being in the office...
You're making assumptions just as much as the rest but yet you claim yours as fact. All we want is a proper investigation into these people. If nothings there then I would be able to sleep easier knowing children aren't being harmed like this...but every time something pizzagate related comes out or we find something, links get deleted, newspaper archives disappear, images get removed from sites, shootings happen (after the street camera gets moved a day prior) and a computer gets shot and removed. Too many strange things have happened and you coming on here and spending your time downplaying it only makes me further suspicious as to what your intentions are. But while you're at it, will you debunk the rest of my post instead of cherry picking...but this time, use links and proof. First things first, discuss the chicken lovers hashtag (it's obviously bright orange and possibly a carrot in the baby's mouth so don't say it's chicken)

            Alex Jones did NOT apologize for pizzagate. Instead, he apologized for certain things that he said about Alefantis. Listen to the video. No one listens. They all read the headline and jump on the crazy bandwagon. The lying scum MSM paints the narrative that he "aplogized for pizzagate". We should be pointing this out to all the outlets that push the false narrative.Tweet back to the liarsj.  He apologized for what he said about alefontis...NOT for pizzagate.
