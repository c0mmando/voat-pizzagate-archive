            Can someone please explain to me what “destruction of the inner genitals” of a male child is?? They keep making reference to it but don’t explain it. Is this possibly something to do with making a young child gay in their sexuality at a young age or ???

             Don't know why I did not get your ping.  This is disgusting.  I don't think it has been proven to turn someone into gay, just that they cannot procreate or make children.  As

             states, it is presently also achieved through MK Ultra/Monarch programming.  Now also we have forces telling parents to not claim a sex for their child.  Let them decide. Hmm.  Recipe for Disaster.

             Destruction of the inner genitals: - usage of needles on inner genitals to destroy the fertility of both sexes - crushing of testicles to destroy fertility on males - taking out bulbourethral gland [reason not 100% clear at this point in time] - Nowadays also with radiation/weapon systems it is possible to cause infertility, etc.. Gay/transsexuality: The children get programmed for sexual preferences - the stories are heartbreaking to read - see: Cathy O'Brien (Transformation of America).

              Hi Andrea, I want to start by saying that I have been reading through your site, which has been so hard to do, and I want to tell you that I am so very, very sorry for what has happened to your son. My heart breaks for him and all of the children affected by this. This world is so cruel, so evil, I am heartbroken for all these lives broken. Thank you so very much for speaking out and doing the site educating and warning others. I do believe what you say. It seems that so many people have been brought up in varying degrees of this torture as children from monarchs, elite families, politicians, police, actors and musicians. I suppose the latter would have had some type of MK Ultra done later in life and I’m unsure how that would work in adult life, nonetheless, it needs to end.

               Thank you - I do feel the same: My heart still is breaking for every single child. Even specialized psychiatrists (here Colin A. Ross) say that these crimes are more brutal than murder, as it is lifelong torture, lifelong drill, and lifelong betrayal. The problem is exactly as you have written:  "It seems that so many people have been brought up in varying degrees of this torture as children from monarchs, elite families, politicians, police, actors, and musicians." - we do know not enough about the various steps and degrees of mind control yet.

            UpVoat!  Thank you for posting this.  The story of The Stone is worth enough for posting.  The description how they train their slaves is scary and frightening.  If anyone doubts that SRA does not exist, this is proof it does.  They are doing this every single day all day long creating little robots to further their sick agenda.  They steal and take over their minds.

            Then lower down is the description of how they use the Mind Control and SRA on a toddler or child.  So very sick and sad.

                Yes, when they know they have done wrong they do not expect hugs and kisses, but love and compassion and understanding is what must be given.

             The list of trauma techniques is personally familiar to me.  I checked yes, (I remember that) to all of them.  Much I didn't want to re-remember but that's just me waking up, it's part of the process of healing.

              Here is a post I did one of our SRA Survivor here on Voat
              <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/user/StcharlesSeminary">
               @StcharlesSeminary
              </a>
              You can read her story and how she has managed to survive.  She is my inspiration.  In the post she names her abuser and I really don't know how she has arrived to where she is today.  She is Amazing and you may find her story and strength an inspiration.  I hope you find the Peace and Justice you so deserve.

               That was a useful link.  I'd missed it.  Survivors reporting is very rare. The amount of comments it got is much more than anything gets now.  When voat closed we lost most of the crowd, about 1/10th what it was.
              </p>
              <p>
               Lately, I've got a lot of Peace. Not even getting called DumbFuck here on voat got me riled.  As for getting Justice? That's not in my life's job description I hope!

                I hear ya!  Yes.   AND I believe SRA is becoming more written about and that means that people will get used to seeing those letters.  We have to admit it is pretty gory and frightening for those that are not familiar with it.  I am all with you about throwing them into a Living Hell.

                 I should have made my name SRA not RSA.  It's the more common usage.  Was the same thing to me, now I'm stuck!

                 The over the top nature of all this evil behavior, makes it "inconceivable" therefore "It must be false memories", goes the self-defending ego.  Herman Goebles technique I believe.   Still, we got to drag them into court to get it factually established.  LOGIC.  Then comes the Living Hell.  A Formerly Admired Public Figure now Outcast.

                  False Memories is a phrase coined by those that want people to believe SRA is made up.  There have been well known org. and psychiatrists that have recently come out to say that this phrase is propaganda for their protection of the very people that are doing the SRA.

                   I totally agree.  It was a planted thought pattern, words introduced to the population to explain in advance, memories that were about to surface that would destroy the Public's reality if believed. The founder of the Amer. Psychiatric association APA, was also in charge of MKyuck.  His group introduced False Memory Syndrome.

                   That doesn't make some memories any more easy to make sense of.  It's some wild shit they know how to do.

           <blockquote>
            <p>
             This crime has become known due, above all, to the “research” carried out by the CIA under the name “MK-Ultra”: in fact, the CIA imported the most famous scientist in the field of mind control, Dr Joseph Mengele, directly from Auschwitz Concentration Camp (where huge numbers of “experiments” were carried out, particularly on Jewish and growth-restricted children) via the ratline to America, from where this crime has rapidly spread throughout the world – particularly within the secret services and among doctors and psychologists eager to conduct human experiments.
