<p>After School Matters, a politically connected youth program that serves as the unofficial charity at City Hall.</p>
<p>According to Mr. Ferguson IG, the city of chg. required firms that got tax increment financing subsidies to donate a share of that money to specific non-profit groups. Of the over two dozen grant agreements signed between 1985 and 2009 that directed cash contributions, at least 59%, specifically designated After School Matters or an affiliate. </p>
<p>After School Matters received $915,000 through such &quot;public benefits&quot; clauses, according to the report. This is on top of more than $54.5 million in direct city grants. Included in that figure is a $6.5-million contract that, was signed four days before Mr. Daley left office in in May.</p>
<p>the board of After School Matters was loaded with political powerhouses beyond Maggie Daley and the Emanuels including Avis Lavelle (former press secretary for Richard Daley and Bill Clinton), Victor Reyes (Daley’s patronage chief), Terry Perucca (a top Illinois executive for Bank of America), Robbie Robinson (who now works solely for Obama. Reynolds is accused of failing to file tax returns for 3 yrs.),Elzie Higginbottom (the former chairman of the Housing Authority of Ck Cnty. He also owns or has a major interest in 97 private companies, several of which are involved with real estate development.a $12 million apartment complex for senior citizens was erected. The project was overseen by Turnstone Development Corp, a non-profit created by the Housing Authority of Cook County. Higginbottom sat on the board for Turnstone Development. And another contractor involved with the project, Burling Builders, lists Higginbottom as its president.Higginbottom has been also been a major fundraiser for former Mayor Richard M. Daley &amp; hosted a fundraiser for Obama at his home.)</p>
<p>im sure you get the point.  refer to my sources to learn more or go online</p>
<p>&quot;The frequent selection of After School Matters for public benefits creates the appearance of preferential treatment for an organization with ties to the city,&quot; his reports states. &quot;Regardless of the nature of the work performed by After School Matters, the lack of transparency in the city\'s public benefits program undermines the public\'s trust.&quot;
   The report suggests Mr. Ferguson effectively stumbled on the TIF donations matter and that he had a hard time getting city employees to detail exactly how things worked  The figures as to how many TIF deals, technically known as redevelopment agreements, required payments to After School Matters is only a &quot;best estimate&quot; from the city\'s law department, the report says. Detailed data were not kept by the city, nor were any rules or standards established as to which groups should get the money, the report says.  No records means no proof.....</p>
<p>The recipients — including such prominent firms as the Wm. Wrigley Jr. Co., LaSalle Street Capital Inc; a building in which bank ABN Amro has offices and Central Station Properties LLC — also were kept in the dark, the reports states.</p>
<p>In interviews with nine recipients, all but one said, &quot;The city unilaterally chose&quot; After School Matters as the agency to which the recipient had to make a cash donation. The recipients generally found out &quot;during later stages of the (TIF) negotiation process.&quot;</p>
<p>In the ninth case, the corporation that received TIF aid was headed by a former mayoral deputy chief of staff.  But even in that case, the TIF contract with the city specified that TIF aid would be reduced dollar for dollar for any shortfall in required charitable donations.  omg  blackmail
   One other private group actually received more money via the public-benefits clause, but only because of a $1.25-million payment to the Leland Apartments Development in one TIF project.
   The city also required some TIF recipients to agree to spend money on city projects.
   Mr. Ferguson\'s report comes at delicate time for Mayor Rahm Emanuel, who has vowed to reform but continues the TIF program. Other groups want to tap hundreds of millions of dollars being held in reserve for TIF projects and instead use it to shore up the city budget and keep city employees from being laid off.</p>

                The truth about the Chicago ponzi scheme would Rock Chicago.  Everything would be upside down.  And the other large cities too.  I think La. is a Hell Hole for Blacks.  I wonder if it is worse than Chicago.  It is a Toss Up.
