<p>Ashley released a statement about his past accusations against NZ\'s deputy prime minster, Paula Bennett.  He talks about being molested as a child by Ms Bennett (including remembering she smelled of kama sutra oil and jasmine).  He also states that at age 14 he ran away from home and worked as an escort, with the majority of his &quot;clients&quot; being high powered, white politicians.</p>
<p>This relates to Pizzagate because it is a confessional statement regarding child sexual abuse by the Elite.</p>
<p>Warning that some of this is detailed and may make you cry and make you nauseated.</p>
<p>Ashley is a very brave man, and this latest attempt by our country\'s deputy PM (who is also police minister and has untold power under her fists) to arrest and threaten him is completely disgusting.</p>
<p>I\'ve been friends on Facebook with Ashley since first hearing his statement, and have learned since then that we have long-had state houses trafficking and violently abusing our country\'s children.  Four women and a group of gentlemen are also speaking in testament to these facts.  All of their stories are harrowing.</p>
<p>I hope this includes the necessary elements for inclusion, if not please let me know where I need to update it.  Thanks.</p>',
