   It seems like #PizzaGate might have gotten a bit carried away when this whole Comet Pizza thing broke off. Can someone please tell me, why did Comet Pizza appear in the picture, how did it all start?

            People saw information that was referenced in emails from the DNC. People did not like this information. Pizzagate and Spiritcooking comprised that part of it. People have focused on the pizza thing. But there is something about the businesses around the pizza place. There are connections, and everything seems to lead back through the Democratic Party, through the Clinton Foundation, maybe right to Saudi Arabia. John Podesta is not a campaign manager. He oversees encryption and NSA policy, and has been involved on that level for a very long time. Pizzagate doesn't matter unless we can find victims, but Pizzagate is part of the distraction too.

            Listed as one of the most influential people in D.C. and called a "D.C. powerplayer" by GQ, despite just being a pizza guy. Shows up in the wikileaks emails corresponding with Podesta, does lucrative fundraisers for the establishment left, gets monetary donations. Had a thing for sexualized symbolism of pizza and also the occasional pedo hint, while people were speculating that pizza was code in Podesta's emails. So that's how attention turned to him, originally, if I understand it right. I stumbled upon the investigation a few days after it had already taken off.

             Thanks, this is what I wanted to know. I just wanted to know exactly where James Alifantis first appeared, and in what context. Thanks to you others who tried to answer my post, but this reply is the only one who actually understood my question.
