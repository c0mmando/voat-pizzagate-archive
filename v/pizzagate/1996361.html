<p><strong>Moving on</strong>, I came across this email: <a href="http://archive.is/gOpgQ">UPDATED: John McCain Research</a> - This email contains various attachments. The attachment titled, &quot;<strong>John McCain 2-22-08.pdf</strong>&quot;, notes the following, rather intriguing, information: </p>
<p><strong>PAGE NUMBER 4:</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Character: McCain is known as a political maverick who puts principle ahead of political calculation and party
loyalty. He has a sharp sense of humour but off-colour jokes sometimes land him in trouble. His volatile temper is
also legendary on Capitol Hill.
Approaching his 72nd birthday, he would be the oldest first-term president ever inaugurated. Supporters point to his
95 year-old mother as evidence of good genes.
He has seven children from two marriages, including <strong>an adopted daughter from a BANGLADESHI ORPHANAGE.</strong>
[Financial Times, 1/28/08] </p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>PAGE NUMBER 6:</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>McCains Adopted A Bangladeshi Orphan That Cindy Brought Back To U.S. For Medical Help. According to
Good Housekeeping, John McCain said that his wife, Cindy’s “finest hour” came when in 1991, when Cindy went
on a trip to Bangladesh, with the American Voluntary Medical Team, an organization she had launched in 1988
with part of her family’s fortune. Also according to Good Housekeeping, Mrs. McCain “…visited an orphanage
where 150 malnourished infants were living in squalor. Toward the end of her stay, nuns brought her a 10-week-old
named Bridget. The baby was severely disfigured by a cleft palate; her caretakers begged Cindy to take her to the
United States for treatment, and she quickly agreed.” Once back in the U.S., both Cindy and John decided to adopt
Bridget. [Good Housekeeping, 2/1/00] </p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>PAGE NUMBER 21:</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>McCain Campaign Used Image Of His Adopted Bangladeshi Daughter In S.C. Mailer. According to the
Associated Press, McCain used an image of his adopted Bangladeshi daughter in a South Carolina campaign
mailer. According to the AP, in the mailer, McCain’s wife Cindy “…is pictured holding a baby in a blanket as she
walks with a woman from Mother Teresa’s orphanage.” The mailer said, “Cindy cradles little Bridget, a baby she
and John adopted in 1993 from Mother Teresa’s orphanage in Bangladesh. Bridget has been a great blessing to the
McCain family…Today, Cindy and John work together to promote adoption and to help women facing crisis
pregnancies.” Although the McCain campaign said the mailer was intended to show McCain’s pro-life position,
the AP pointed out that in 2000, McCain’s opposition launched several attacks against McCain and alleged that he
had an illegitimate black daughters. [AP, 1/11/08] </p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>PAGE NUMBER 83:</strong> </p>
<blockquote>
<p>McCain “Seems To Be Adopting Tactics He Previously Criticized.” According to the Charleston Gazette,
“Respected Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., is running for president again. Although he has long been a cleancampaigns
advocate, he seems to be adopting tactics he previously criticized. At least, he’s hiring campaign
operatives once involved in ugly smears. During early Republican primary elections in 2000, campaign dirty
tricksters attacked McCain, falsely, for being a traitor while he was in jail as a prisoner of war in Vietnam. And an 
outfit backing George W. Bush made telephone calls to potential voters in the South Carolina primary suggesting
that McCain had fathered a ‘black child,’ perhaps with a ‘black prostitute.’ (The McCains did adopt a daughter,
named Bridget, through an orphanage Mother Teresa had created in Bangladesh.) During the 2004 presidential
campaign, Swift Boat Veterans for Truth ran television ads smearing Sen. John Kerry, D-Mass., who was running
against Bush. At the time, McCain attacked those Swift Boat ads as ‘dishonest and dishonorable.’ But today,
McCain is using that same Swift Boat firm to help him plan campaign ads for 2008. He also has hired a wide array
of dirty tricksters to run his presidential race, including key political operatives Bush used to attack McCain in
2000, according to the New York Times. Last fall, McCain’s top adviser criticized a TV smear of former Rep.
Harold E. Ford Jr., D-Tenn, which showed the black congressman flirting with a young, scantily clad, blonde, white
woman. The ad had racist overtones. Terry Nelson, a former Bush campaign consultant, headed the committee
sponsoring that ad. McCain first hired Nelson as an adviser last spring. After the Ford TV ad controversy hit the
news, McCain promoted Nelson to his national campaign manager, the Times reports. What has happened to the
Arizona Republican known for integrity?” [Editorial, Charleston Gazette, 2/12/07]</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>PAGE NUMBER 98:</strong> </p>
<blockquote>
<p>McCain Accused of Having Illegitimate Daughter
McCain’s Daughter Portrayed As Child of an Illicit Union. According to the New York Times, “There are the
children from his first marriage — Doug and Andy, from his first wife’s former marriage — whom he adopted
when they were small, as well as a daughter, Sidney. Then there is the second family: Meghan, Jimmy, Jack and the
McCain’s adopted daughter, Bridget, 16, who became a target of dirty campaigning in the 2000 presidential race,
when she was portrayed as the child of an illicit union.” [New York Times, 12/27/07] </p>
<p>McCains Adopted A Bangladeshi Orphan That Cindy Brought Back To U.S. For Medical Help.
According to Good Housekeeping, John McCain said that his wife, Cindy’s “finest hour” came when in
1991, when Cindy went on a trip to Bangladesh, with the American Voluntary Medical Team, an

<p>I will try to make additional future posts regarding further review of the emails which show up as part of the <strong>2,270 results</strong>. However, I\'m severely limited on time due to personal life commitments. Hence, I\'m sharing this information with all of you, in hopes of garnering help from you, my fellow investigators, in reviewing some of these emails. They could potentially generate vast amounts of crucial information regarding this INTERNATIONAL CHILD TRAFFICKING NETWORK, which seems to be operating under the guise of humanitarian aid for innocent <strong>Orphaned Children Worldwide.</strong></p>',

            Character: McCain is known as a political maverick who puts principle ahead of political calculation and party
loyalty. He has a sharp sense of humour but off-colour jokes sometimes land him in trouble. His volatile temper is
also legendary on Capitol Hill.
Approaching his 72nd birthday, he would be the oldest first-term president ever inaugurated. Supporters point to his
95 year-old mother as evidence of good genes.
He has seven children from two marriages, including
            <strong>
             an adopted daughter from a BANGLADESHI ORPHANAGE.

            McCains Adopted A Bangladeshi Orphan That Cindy Brought Back To U.S. For Medical Help. According to
Good Housekeeping, John McCain said that his wife, Cindy’s “finest hour” came when in 1991, when Cindy went
on a trip to Bangladesh, with the American Voluntary Medical Team, an organization she had launched in 1988
with part of her family’s fortune. Also according to Good Housekeeping, Mrs. McCain “…visited an orphanage
where 150 malnourished infants were living in squalor. Toward the end of her stay, nuns brought her a 10-week-old
named Bridget. The baby was severely disfigured by a cleft palate; her caretakers begged Cindy to take her to the
United States for treatment, and she quickly agreed.” Once back in the U.S., both Cindy and John decided to adopt
Bridget. [Good Housekeeping, 2/1/00]

            McCain Campaign Used Image Of His Adopted Bangladeshi Daughter In S.C. Mailer. According to the
Associated Press, McCain used an image of his adopted Bangladeshi daughter in a South Carolina campaign
mailer. According to the AP, in the mailer, McCain’s wife Cindy “…is pictured holding a baby in a blanket as she
walks with a woman from Mother Teresa’s orphanage.” The mailer said, “Cindy cradles little Bridget, a baby she
and John adopted in 1993 from Mother Teresa’s orphanage in Bangladesh. Bridget has been a great blessing to the
McCain family…Today, Cindy and John work together to promote adoption and to help women facing crisis
pregnancies.” Although the McCain campaign said the mailer was intended to show McCain’s pro-life position,
the AP pointed out that in 2000, McCain’s opposition launched several attacks against McCain and alleged that he
had an illegitimate black daughters. [AP, 1/11/08]

            McCain “Seems To Be Adopting Tactics He Previously Criticized.” According to the Charleston Gazette,
“Respected Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., is running for president again. Although he has long been a cleancampaigns
advocate, he seems to be adopting tactics he previously criticized. At least, he’s hiring campaign
operatives once involved in ugly smears. During early Republican primary elections in 2000, campaign dirty
tricksters attacked McCain, falsely, for being a traitor while he was in jail as a prisoner of war in Vietnam. And an 
outfit backing George W. Bush made telephone calls to potential voters in the South Carolina primary suggesting
that McCain had fathered a ‘black child,’ perhaps with a ‘black prostitute.’ (The McCains did adopt a daughter,
named Bridget, through an orphanage Mother Teresa had created in Bangladesh.) During the 2004 presidential
campaign, Swift Boat Veterans for Truth ran television ads smearing Sen. John Kerry, D-Mass., who was running
against Bush. At the time, McCain attacked those Swift Boat ads as ‘dishonest and dishonorable.’ But today,
McCain is using that same Swift Boat firm to help him plan campaign ads for 2008. He also has hired a wide array
of dirty tricksters to run his presidential race, including key political operatives Bush used to attack McCain in
2000, according to the New York Times. Last fall, McCain’s top adviser criticized a TV smear of former Rep.
Harold E. Ford Jr., D-Tenn, which showed the black congressman flirting with a young, scantily clad, blonde, white
woman. The ad had racist overtones. Terry Nelson, a former Bush campaign consultant, headed the committee
sponsoring that ad. McCain first hired Nelson as an adviser last spring. After the Ford TV ad controversy hit the
news, McCain promoted Nelson to his national campaign manager, the Times reports. What has happened to the
Arizona Republican known for integrity?” [Editorial, Charleston Gazette, 2/12/07]

            For clarity and perspective, we should note that most, if not all, of the "orphan" references in Podesta's emails are settings defining printing parameters and are included in the phrase "mso-pagination: widow-orphan"  Widows and orphans defined:
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Widows_and_orphans">

            And to think you can be declared an orphan even though you may still have a living parent:
           </p>

            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            "UNICEF and global partners define an orphan as a child under 18 years of age who has lost one or both parents to any cause of death. By this definition, there were nearly 140 million orphans globally in 2015, including 61 million in Asia, 52 million in Africa, 10 million in Latin America and the Caribbean, and 7.3 million in Eastern Europe and Central Asia. This large figure represents not only children who have lost both parents, but also those who have lost a father but have a surviving mother or have lost their mother but have a surviving father."

            The Governor and the children are on their way to the United States. Thank you very much for all of your assistance. I  know that this was a huge diversion from an already overwhelming set of circumstances. Your help was invaluable -- these kids will make it because of what you did to help get them out of Haiti.

            If you have a moment we have a bit of a urgent matter -- you may know we are attempting to bring about sixty children  from Haiti -- they are orphans (per dating the earthquake) that resided in an orphanage managed by two women from Pittsburgh who are affiliated with the Catholic church.  The military has been very helpful and the plane to pick up the children will be landing in Haiti at 5:40 -- the Governor is on that plane because he was told the Haitian officials would not release the children (due to the short notice) without  the Governor taking personal responsibility for their well being.  He began this effort by communicating with the state department to ensure their cooperation and in spite of them being very overwhelmed, they have been extremely helpful to our efforts to move this children to safety in the U.S.  However, we just learned via the military that the counsel general in the embassy is not willing to process the paperwork  for all the children who have home plans in the U.S. We don't know the exact reasons why. We are attempting to reach Huma at State since she's been involved but we cannot reach her. Our question is whether you have someway to help  us reach Huma or anyone else who could help us resolve this matter with the counsel general so the children can be released.

            This is interesting and I will finish reading it tomorrow. About John McCain's daughter. His wife called him from the plane on the way back from Bangladesh where she was involved in some humanitarian work to tell him she was bringing back a child for them to adopt. This whole gimmick was not his idea... at all. But what can you do?
