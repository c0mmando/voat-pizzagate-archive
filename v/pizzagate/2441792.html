<p>Well the band &quot;Flaming Lips&quot; asked her to be in the sick music video for their song &quot;The First Time Ever I Saw Your Face&quot; and she agreed. In it she\'s laying in a bath filled with glitter at first, which turns into a bath of blood and entrails on her. Then it turns into breast milk/Seamon and she drinks it. Not kidding.When it was originally posted people flipped out. She made Flaming Lips remove it from YouTube and other websites claiming they manipulated her. Someone on YouTube had recorded the video and uploaded it in 2013.</p>

<p>Blood, Seamon/Breastmilk = Spirit Cooking. Was she really manipulated or was she surprised not only her fanbase but the whole world was in horror at this sick music video? This was released in 2012, years before Pizzagate or Spirit Cooking was known..</p>',
