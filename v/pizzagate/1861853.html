<p>Similar to above. I\'m currently going through the comments on 40 submissions, no help needed yet. My final goals are a Katy Perry related <strong>video</strong> and Katy Perry related <strong>meme</strong>. I picked her as I think with celebrities there\'s potential to get a wide audience. I\'m not about to discredit her in any way, but instead figure out something positive, easy to spread, but at the same time <strong>awakening</strong> for the masses.</p>

            Hard to know which thread will bring action..for instance, right now looking to be Seth Rich but who knows if that is manipulation and a false flag.  Hard to get enough "dirt" on public officials as they are shifty.  We certainly need to keep red pilling.  More to this than just what we see/hear...I believe a spiritual battle under way and those that are "awake" need to help others wake up...this is the MOST important thing I think we can do.  Once you are awake, well, you cannot go back..and every day we add to the critical mass it will take to bring these choads down.  Everyone has different WHY's that will ring with them and cause them their own journey...we need to play to the WHY's...get people asking that question.  Like "Is England mystery babylon?" :-)

            We need a megathread on the Silsby case. We need one on Haiti, that could include Laura Silsby and Monica Peterson, but those two topics could be threads in and of themselves.
            <br/>
            We could use one on the seemingly coded language in the emails- pizza, tortillas, etc.
            <br/>
            I can't atm, but I will do this later if someone doesn't beat me to it.
            <br/>
            If we start a post to collect info, should we post it here? How will these megathread posts stay organized and easy to find?

             Agree here..if you look at what could bring down HRC, WJC, or the foundation this would be one, Seth Rich would be one, and certainly Weiner's laptop...

             That'd be great, yes! Just start that, and please visit back here to link that under here too.

             The organizing and accessibility will be figured out somehow. Might be a link in the side bar, might be something else we come up with together. Until that, just ping/remind.

            Just being aware of red flags, knowing you cannot be too trustful of ANY organizations that work with children, keeping and eye on your local area for shady behavior, all that will slowly pay off in the long run too to making the world around us a better safer place for kids. A few years ago if I caught a guy staring at my kids weird in a supermarket I'd just have shuffled them away, maybe given a dirty look, now knowing another parent might be distracted or less suspicious what could happen in those cases, now I'd question the guy and follow him to his car and get his license plate or a photo, this kind of defensive behavior will go a long way discourage pedos. A punch in the face or worse is ideal if you can, but don't ruin your own life if you can avoid it. The fight is over the long run. I hope we get some justice now for the kids and see pedos jailed or worse but either way our increased awareness lays the ground work for a better safer future.

             Thanks! Cool down there and refuel, take all the time needed. My project advances, I've now gone through all the comments in each submission now. I found some 20 useful ones, and an idea of what I should focus on and what to drop. Looking good so far, entering stage 2 without any specified schedule.

              What a refreshing break from all the fake Seth Rich news.  This will certainly help those that are new and even us that have been around for awhile.  When people don't know when or where to start and also for those that just want to pick one and get going. Thank you for this.
