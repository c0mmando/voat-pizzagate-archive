            And you can bet that the Clinton Foundation runs an humanitarian charity effort in every third world country where there are high numbers of children orphans or refugees.

             Yes and they are the ones who orchestrated the demise of these countries so they could 'help themselves' to the children, from what I have read all over the internet.  Sick sick sick - Killary for Prison - Bill for Prison for his crimes too!

            The Dima Yakovlev trial took place in Fairfax, Virginia which is ironically also been where the international adoption agency Adoptions Together has held their fund raisers.  They operate out of D.C., Maryland and Virginia and work with the local governments there to place children.

            They have been promoted by DynCorp International which has trafficked kids Bulgaria.  Adoptions Together is also linked to Family Works together which arguably has a girl lover symbol.

            One last interesting find of mine.  Hillary Clinton joined a child welfare program with Adoptions Together that wanted to see the end of restricting access to adoptions to gay couples.  The problem with this is some of those are clearly pedophiles who, like Alefantis, use being gay as a cover to claim discrimination when someone calls them on their pedophilia.

            I remember those cases and they were horrible.  They always blamed them on Alcoholic Parents and how the babies had damaged brains or other problems that made them act out so bad the parents were beside themselves.  Now we know the real story.  I do not blame Putin for putting a stop to the adoptions.  Russia is our go to for blame.  I am not saying they are perfect, but it's getting a little old.
