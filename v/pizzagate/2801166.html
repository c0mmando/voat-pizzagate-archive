They had raped and tortured girls as young as 11, and forced them into prostitution.</h2>
<h2>British Home Secretary Sajid Wrote In A Tweet \'These sick Asian paedophiles are finally facing justice\'.</h2>
<h2>Now He <a href="http://archive.is/f5J0j">Gets Slammed</a> For Mentioning The Ethnicity Of The Gang Members By MPs and Human Rights Campaigners.</h2>
<p><em>Javid tweeted:</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>\'These sick Asian paedophiles are finally facing justice. I want to commend the bravery of the victims. For too long, they were ignored. Not on my watch. There will be no no-go areas\'</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>Which is kind of funny - everybody knows there <strong>are</strong> no-go areas in many British cities, and Javid didn\'t become Home Secretary yesterday - so this has to be seen as a kind of virtue-signalling to voters.</em> </p>
<p>The trial of the gang members was publicly discussed since Tommy Robinson, a Britsh right-wing campaigner, went to jail in the wake of his activism regarding the trial. </p>
<p>As <a href="https://voat.co/u/MolochHunter">@MolochHunter</a> has <a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/2800126">pointed out</a>, the perps were able to get out on bail, and one of them left the country (surprise, surprise!), and fled to Pakistan.</p>
<h1></h1>
<h1><strong>Labour MP David Lammy</strong> said: “Sajid Javid has brought a great office of state into disrepute. By singling out ‘Asians’ he not only panders to the far right but increases the risk of violence and abuse against minorities across the country.&quot;</h1>
<p>“Whatever the underlying motives of the offenders involved, paedophilia is an abhorrent crime that affects all communities. It does no service to the victims of this evil to pin the blame on any one group.”</p>
<p><em>Well, when <a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/2699545">84% of convicted perps</a> of child rape gangs <strong>belong</strong> to <strong>one</strong> ethnic group, it would be good to pont that out, wouldn\'t it? Especially when taking into account that the crimes of Pakistani child rape gangs were covered up for decades since everybody was silenced who dared to talk about it with accusations of \'racism\'.</em> </p>
<h1></h1>
<p><strong>Diane Abbott, the Labour shadow home secretary</strong>, said: “These are horrific crimes. As the judge said, many of these girls will never recover from the abuse they have suffered. Falling support for survivors is inexcusable.&quot; </p>
<h2>&quot;Attempts by authorities and now it seems the government to attribute these crimes to one ethnic group does nothing to support these vulnerable women in the way of social services, mental health services or the resources needed by the police to bring all sexual predators to justice.&quot;</h2>
<p><em>In fact, it is necessary to point out that most child rape gang members (who get convicted - white elite child rapists are unlikely to get convicted as we know) have a common background. The Pakistani communtiy in Britain must continue to discuss why so many of its members are involved in child rape crimes.</em></p>
<p>In July, Javid ordered research to be carried out into the characteristics of child sexual abuse gangs. The research will look into how such gangs operate and how that compares to other forms of child sexual abuse.</p>
<p><em>Yes, but he did so only after he got severely pressured by MPs like Sarah Champion (Rotherham).</em></p>
<p><strong>Zubaida Haque, the deputy director of the Runnymede Trust</strong>, said: “I agree with him [Javid] – we absolutely need to applaud the victims and survivors for coming forward. It’s a tremendous act of courage considering the multiple acts of abuse that they’ve had to experience.&quot;</p>
<p><em>(<a href="https://voat.co/u/letsdothis2">@letsdothis2</a>: Can we look into her and the Runnymede Trust?)</em></p>
<h2>“But racialising this crime and focusing on the ethnicity of the sexual predators has done little to address why and how these victims were vulnerable to the prey of these sexual predators.&quot;</h2>
<p>“It’s extraordinary that Sajid Javid set up an inquiry to look at why Asian men were more likely to be in CSE [child sexual exploitation] grooming gangs when his priority all the time should have been why and how victims were vulnerable and where safeguards had failed.”</p>
<h1></h1>
<h2>Shoaib Khan, a human rights lawyer, said: “This tweet is irresponsible, dangerous and divisive. It is unbelievable that it is a genuine tweet from a serving home secretary, who was previously communities secretary.&quot;</h2>
<p>“Not only does it show just how tone-deaf the home secretary is to British society, but it is factually incorrect. In particular, the perpetuation of the myth that ‘no-go areas’ exist in this country is particularly irresponsible and misleading.&quot;</p>
<p><em>Ok, I gather he isn\'t a white female who has tried to have a walk in certain areas in London and elsewhere....</em></p>
<p>“Defining these criminals by their ethnicity is also playing right into the hands of the far right. Unless it is now Home Office policy that any time an incident is reported on, the perpetrator’s ethnicity will be mentioned, the home secretary should admit he was wrong, retract this tweet and apologise.”</p>
<h1></h1>
<p><strong>Expect an official apology from Javid in 3....2....1.....</strong></p>

            Sad but it's the reality. Javid should really call these people what they are Muslims. There's plenty of Sikhs and Hindus and Buddhists in England and they rarely ever offend. Asians include Japanese and Chinese. Sure there's Tong and Triads in the UK but they keep their affairs between their communities. Even here in the Northeast of England, I saw Muslims behave with impunity in the early 90's towards schoolgirls when I was leaving school. They'd hang around in flash Cosworths and BMWs picking up kids at the school gates. Back then there were very few, I'd hate to think what it's like now.

             Right! Asian people must be pissed about the calling these Muslims Asian.  They say that Middle Easterners are actually Causasian so why are they calling them Asian? I know the answer but how are they justifying it?

            Never thought I’d ever be in the position of siding with Javid and praising of his raising the ethnicity aspect - however, to use the term ‘Asians’ is too general and using this umbrella term still falls painfully short of calling it what it is for what it is; these are Pakistani Muslim men preying on young white girls.  And as for Shoaib Khan calling ‘no go’ areas a ‘myth’?  He really needs to get out of his little shell and see what the rest of us are seeing.  London has several.  The Pakistani Grooming Gang problem needs to be properly faced head on with open discussion that isn’t handcuffed by political correctness.

            I take issue with calling them Asian gangs because it is a deflection. There are almost zero Sihk or Hindu participants,  they are typically Pakistani  Sunni muslim. For whom this conduct is sanctioned in the Quran 33:50 . Even when 10-15% of the rapists are Africans they are also generally Sunni

             That is true, I know Sihks and Hindu are very peaceful Asian people, they also have no animosity towards the British people and have integrated very well for years. So yes, the umbrella term is very unfair.

              there are some Sufi muslims (Morocco) participants, but the Paki / Bangladeshi Sunni tend to always be the ringleaders / pimps, but there's also Romanian grooming gangs operating too
             </p>
             <p>
              interestingly there are few arabic participants, Arabic Muslims tend to have a different sensibility about age of consent (however over-represented they may be in other forms of jihad)

               Sufis? I doubt it. They're despise by both Sunni and Shia alike. They're like the Gnostics of Islam. Not long ago a Sufi was murdered in Glasgow for wishing Chrisitian a happy Easter. If you provide evidence of Sufi involvement I'll be frankly astonished.

                I may be mistaken,  conceded. I'm aware Sufis are not as patriarchal as Sunni / Shia.  And the evidence I've read hasn't been detailed enough - it speaks of not uncommon Moroccan Islamic participation,  but it doesn't specify what creed of Islam
               </p>
               <p>
                So it may be Moroccan Sunni,  I don't know

            There are areas in the UK you dare not walk as a girl/woman. I lived in Birmingham growing up and there is a lovely park there called Small Heath Park.  Even in the 1970s my sister and I could not walk through it without being touched or surrounded by them, the stories from other girls were disgusting.  Also in the Bull Ring Shopping Centre, in the centre of Birmingham, there was an overhead corridor of about 50 indoor shops linking to other shops called the Palisades - This was a definite no go area, they would hang around in gangs , you were metal if you even thought of walking across after about midday.  Not a single speck of respect for a teen girl, it was a free for all.  Since this was happening in the the 1970s goodness knows what its like now! 
Birmingham is, I think, the largest as.ian community in the UK now. This video says a lot.
