<blockquote>
<p>John Podesta, Hillary Clinton’s former campaign chairman, has gotten his fair share of scrutiny from the right-wing media like the Daily Caller regarding a variety of conspiracy theories. </p>
<p>So when junior Nicole Kiprilov asked him how he was dealing with accusations of being involved with the now-debunked “Pizzagate” scandal, that he owned 75,000 “undisclosed” shares of stock from a company with Russian Kremlin ties and Uranium One being a client of the Podesta Group—among other allegations—he didn’t hold back.</p>
<p>“This is how the alt-right does fake news,&quot; Podesta said. &quot;It’s personally painful because a lot of this is really total bullsh<em>t. My family and I have been put through this Pizzagate bullsh</em>t now for a year—which has totally been debunked, by the way.&quot;</p>
<p>During the talk titled &quot;One Year Later: America\'s Role One Year After the Election that Shook the World&quot; in Penn Pavilion Wednesday night, Podesta went on to push back on the student\'s other points, and noted that such allegations are not rare on the internet. He also discussed the Trump presidency and the 2016 election at the event, which was part of the Ambassador Dave and Kay Phillips Family Lecture series.</p>
<p>“My relationship with the company that you talked about, that was based in Boston, an American innovative company—I totally disclosed [my relationship with it]. Fox [News] has had to correct that twice,&quot; he added in response to Kiprilov\'s question. &quot;I could go down the rest of your list. I have no relationship to the Podesta Group and haven’t for 15 years. You can stick with it. The one thing I will tell you is you have a lot of company on Twitter and on the internet, so have at it.”</p>
<p>The allegations regarding the 75,000 shares and regarding his involvement with Uranium One through the Podesta Group—a lobbying firm he ran with his brother until he departed the firm in the 1990\'s—have received public scrutiny.</p>
<p>Kiprilov said she didn’t believe in Pizzagate, a conspiracy theory claiming that Clinton and her top aides were running a child-trafficking ring out of a pizza parlor. But she said she asked the question because she was curious as to how he deals with such claims.</p>
<p>“Pizzagate was a conspiracy theory, but the other allegations, I don’t know,” Kiprilov said. “If he had been a bit calmer and more mature in answering the questions, I would have been satisfied. I was disappointed that he got so angered and triggered by my question.”</p>
<p>A self-identified Republican who says she is not part of the alt-right, Kiprilov said she felt that Podesta misunderstood the nature of her question. </p>
<p>&quot;I did not imply that I believed any of this,&quot; she said. &quot;I think he immediately assumed I did, so he lumped me with the alt-right crowd, which was very unfortunate that he jumped to that conclusion.”</p>
<p>The junior said she spoke with him after the event to clarify that she was not part of the alt-right and to try to get what she deemed a satisfactory answer from him. She said that he then noted he tries to ignore conspiracy theories to protect his family, but tries to address some of the ones that are not rooted in hate. </p>
<p>Before opening the floor to the question-and-answer time in which Kiprilov asked the question, the former chief of staff to President Bill Clinton and counselor to President Barack Obama spoke on a wide range of subjects, from his thoughts on the Trump administration to the Clinton campaign strategy. </p>
<p>He said his biggest regret from the Clinton campaign was not publishing Clinton’s emails the day the New York Times reported that she was using a private email server. He said that he did not do it later because he handed them over to the State Department.</p>
<p>“People could have seen what was there and wouldn’t have been into all of this 13 months of trying to scrape through what all of this was about,” Podesta said. “What they would have seen is a hard-working, smart, diligent and dedicated person—someone who got a lot done as Secretary of State.” </p>
<p>The Federal Bureau of Investigation ruled in 2016 that it wouldn’t charge Clinton for putting classified information on a private email server while serving as President Obama’s Secretary of State. Podesta said that former FBI Director James Comey’s decision to reopen the investigation less than two weeks before the election had an effect on the results of the contest.</p>
<p>“That definitely tightened the race in the last week,” he said. “But you’ve got to be built to be able to win. We got more votes, but weren’t able to win.”</p>
<p>Although Podesta said that he didn’t think the Russian efforts to fiddle with voting on election day succeeded, he thought their meddling with influence through bots, Facebook ads and fake news did. </p>
<p>“I do think that had an effect,&quot; he said. &quot;It eats away at you underneath. You don’t fully sense it because it’s not bubbling up to the mainstream.”</p>
<p>In a recently-released book, Donna Brazile, interim chair of the Democratic National Committee, alleges that Sen. Bernie Sanders never had a fair chance against Clinton in the primary because Clinton was able to control the financing, strategy, and money raised in a joint fundraising committee. Podesta said the joint-fundraising agreement in question was to be used only for the general election, not for the primaries. </p>
<p>“We raised money for the DNC purposefully, lawfully and consistently with what previous Democratic nominees had done to be used in the general election. Donna now looks back on that and says that indicated that fix was in,” Podesta said. &quot;The truth is Senator Sanders was able to compete vigorously in a calendar that had been preset before either one of them was in the race, and he lost.&quot;</p>

            They always use the word "debunked" as their defence. Can a someone being tried in a court just tell the jury its all been "debunked" and then get off with all their crimes?   We need a new word/ phrase to push back on this "debunked" BS.

             I did, it's from today, but the person who published the article isn't the person who did the interview. My thoughts were Ben Leonard could have wrote this about an older interview.

            No one ever fucking said they were operating out of cpp. "Been debunked". It was never...
What was stated was his fucking emails that are clearly pedo code and indeed much worse. This is classic quixotic, straw man build and take down 
To distract and obfuscate from the screaming obvious evidence. 
Explain the fucking "art".  The spirit cooking, the mangled hand photo, the "pizza for 1 hour", (remember the nypd busted for advertising cheese pizza), hrc and silsby, Haiti, the skippy video.

            He agreed to interview with the weakest female "journalist" he could find. 
If it wasn't for guilt and evidence he'd be on Ellen, Oprah, gma, etc...bot he ain't. He's in hiding and spends his time projecting guilt and offering straw man excuses with ignorant cunt reporters from the local Peace Corp girl scout troop.

             People said this all the time.   People claimed that children were being held in cages that an old video of a kid having a tantrum and screaming on the side walk was a child being held under CPP and crying for help (and the videographer didn't notice this because the screams were only picked up by the camera's microphone.)
            </p>
            <p>
             Several people went to Comet Ping Pong and videoed themselves speculating on the scary vibe they felt it was  or to look for the basement or the spooky back room.
            </p>
            <p>
             It was only when this was exposed as nonsense did people drop the idea.  Then they got all excited about BUCKS HAVING A BASEMENT.   They speculated about tunnels under CPP and a tunnel connected Bucks.
            </p>
            <p>
             They did this all the time.

            <p>
             The MSM has trouble saying what pizzagate because it's such a load of tangential nonsense.  You can't summarize how you get from Podesta's emails to child trafficking in less than 5 sentences.

              Who said? Some obscure quip from where? All we've ever seen or heard was cover up from the left. Npr iinterview, Megyn Kelly bs cover up piece. Countless "debunked" stories. Now this one. There are real questions about emails that didn't get wiped...with a cloth. Real questions about screaming kids, sick art, sick photos. 
He had never faced nor answeref any of these most basic questions. Only bs lollypop smiles and questions from ignorant cunts. Real and provable? This isn't a court of law but any case is usually bits- Until someone sings. 6500 pedo arrests and counting...we sit and hope.

               And they have actually found zero evidence for child sex trafficking.  And the evidence they cite is things like the murals on the walls.  No wonder people say it's debunked.

              <p>
               So no actual evidence then?  Just some bad art criticism?  And you wonder why people say it's debunked.   Pizzagate was always prebunked because the conclusion came before the evidence.

              <p>
               This has always been the heart of Pizzagate a giant completely unsupported allegation.  And trying to tie in real actual cases as evidence that are completely unrelated.  Sandusky, Saville, Dutrox, etc.

               People said this all the time. People claimed that children were being held in cages that an old video of a kid having a tantrum and screaming on the side walk was a child being held under CPP and crying for help

              I saw that video and there was no mention of Clinton. It's like Iam7777777 said, the "Clinton operating a trafficking ring out of CPP" is strawman cut from whole cloth.

                A. Welch was never shown to be more than an extra in movies from years ago.  I think he currently worked in a supermarket.  Now he's in prison in Illinois, seem a big price to pay for such a ridiculous reason.

                B.   Do you really think you have to stage that whole scenario to get rid of a computer hard drive?  Seriously? You can just buy a new computer or a new hard drive?  You could walk out the door on any night with a hard drive in your pocket and go an toss it in the river and noone would know.   No you're going to stage some risky armed assault where someone could get killed?

                 Are you really that dumb? The point was to get it looking like a crazy guy did it. His family has already been scrutinized on this forum and others. They are freaks that are subservient to this whole gang of criminals. It had nothing to do with the computer, but it did have every intention of being a staged event. Why don't you just go somewhere else.

            He list his cool likely because they weren't supposed to mention pizzagate at all. Either that was a precondition of his appearance and it FAILED, or he really expects that the MSM should lull the people back to sleep and he got irritated cause more are woke. Also, his explanation is that he handled everything according to the advice of his lawyer so no foul. Unfortunately, just because he sold his stock
And followed bad advice doesn't erase his involvement in something that he himself is trying to scapegoat others for. His excuses never end, huh?

            Wow MR. PIZZAGATE HIMSELF is clearly most worried about the ALT-RIGHT (and not y'all)-- but why not throw more cons/Republicans under the bus, mention Flynn Jr. etc?
           </p>
           <p>
            Because the distinguishing feature of the "alt-right" is that they Name The Jew, obviously.

           <p>
            Why did I know the name of Dr. David Duke before I turned ten and already knew he was some sort of monster just from the contexts in which he was mentioned?  Considered the most evil man in America, a hater of blacks, because he writes books and lectures about Jews and says nothing about blacks ever.

             Actually, what they're trying to do it make this seem like all this is coming from the "crazy" alt right because then they can write it off as hate speech. They don't give a shit about Jews, that's the cover story so they can do the above.
