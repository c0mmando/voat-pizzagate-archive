            I believe it to be true. I have seen first hand the depth of the corruption in our government to the extent that it is treason, for reasons not directly related to pizzagate. When reduced to abstract power dynamics, things become radically predictable. Remember: FBIanon mentioned the "world model," that some in the intelligence community were working on.

            Totally. Yes I did see that. There is more to James Alefantis than he's letting on. I'm a pretty good judge of character. There is a reason why James is the 59th most influential person in DC.

           <p>
            To be honest my gut instinct tells me he's associated with the CIA or some hard core covert Brownstone op. He was way too cool, calm and collected in his interview with Megan Kelly. A truly innocent person would acknowledge his critics. They'd go out of their way to assure people nothing is wrong. He'd say something like "I know my Instagram pics were sketchy. But some Pizzagater wrote in 'Haitian special with extra cheese'. It wasn't any of my friends. And yes Edgar Welch really did hit our computer system through random chance when he fired his weapon."
           </p>
           <p>
            But he didn't address anything. He made people feel stupid for even thinking a "Haitian special with extra cheese" could be sketchy since it's not on the menu. That's weird. Something is not right here.

            So nobody figures it out, I would guess. I'm just theorizing. I mean, imagine if you came across the thing podesta said about "making an example" of a leaker, if you were the leaker! I'd go to the FBI and fake my death.

            Here are photos of a plywood casket that doesn't even appear to have a lid on it, with a blanket draped over it being taken out of his funeral and placed into a hearse. I find it strange that the casket is plywood with a blanket over it and with no signs of a lid and also seems very small for seth rich. what do you guys think?

             Could it be covered because it was an open casket? This photo was supposedly "following" the funeral.

              No way.  Rich's family has a Jewish background; no open casket funerals.

               If that's the case, maybe the cloths are flags or other types of things left on the casket as parting gifts? Is it normal to leave such things on the casket for transport though?

            OP- "I know most former athletes who don't make do take up law enforcement."  -Not really...and especially not when we're talking GU Football. My best friend in High School went on to play on THIS TEAM at Georgetown from 97-01' ...I was at their parties often...Most of the guy on the team were goofballs with rich parents who were handed jobs on Wall Street after college (their team as a whole had a pretty big issue with Coke too)  Most had zero NFL aspirations...this guy is 5'10'' 175...smaller than most NFL kickers...Anyway- like i said...doesn't mean its not a good lead...keep digging. I'll text my buddy to see if he remembers this guy/any info on sister. My friend was a year older and played safety

            I'm not at my comp, but something to dig through: i noticed the head commander of the fifth district for the MPD (dc police) is mentioned a lot in the Stratfor wikileaks files, william fitzgerald, goes by Bill in the files

            Good catch. The DC police seem suspect to me. I got real suspicious after they said they investigated Comet Ping Pong after Edgar Welch went looking for kidnapped children there. Turns out old Edgar is quite a shot. He managed to quite miraculously through random chance hit the Comet Ping Pong computer system. The bullet hole doesn't look like a ricochet off the ceiling where the police say he fired his gun. Rather the bullet hole looks like someone stood about 5 feet away from the computer and fired a shot into it. ;-)
           </p>
           <p>
            The CPP computer with bullet hole is here:
            <a href="https://youtu.be/2AsyOxk21i0?t=135YouTube">
             https://youtu.be/2AsyOxk21i0?t=135YouTube
            </a>
            . Note the impact looks like someone stood in the doorway and fired in a horizontal motion. That's very sketchy. If Edgar Welch went to Comet Ping Pong looking for children he wouldn't fire randomly into closets. There could be children hidden in there. ;-)
           </p>
           <p>
            So let's call a spade a spade. The DC police lied about the investigation:
            <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omlQHWrgmd4YouTube">
             https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omlQHWrgmd4YouTube
            </a>
            .
           </p>
           <p>
            The Edgar Welch dude didn't really go into CPP looking for kids. The whole event was staged. And that means a conspiracy to silence an investigation which is exactly what happened 20 years ago with the Franklin scandal.

            What if Seth Rich WAS the leaker but WASN'T actually killed, and instead went into hiding. He would make one hell of a witness if this were the case. Would it be illegal to fake his death? Did he have an open casket??

             That would explain the father's lack of emotion during the interview. Anybody find that odd? If my kid had just died I'd be wreck.

              Edit: look at the son. He can't stop smiling. Its duping delight if I ever saw it. I bet Seth Rich could easily be alive and in some sort of witness protection type thing. Just thinking out loud.

            Dude, it might as well be. They're another major funnel for Democratic donor funds. This is potentially really big. We need confirmation of any relationship between the two of them.
