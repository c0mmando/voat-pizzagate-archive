           <p>
            In the video you say: 'There is an absolute similarity in how they look'.
           </p>
           <p>
            And here you wrote: 'They just don't look like the same girl to me...'
           </p>
           <p>
            Aren't you contradicting yourself?
           </p>
           <p>
            You claimed here that the picture originates from 'a female doing a teenage girly blog'. Firstly, I don't get what this is supposed to prove, and, secondly, please provide your source (I already know it but I want you to write it down here).
           </p>
           <p>
            You're also exhorting people to not waste their time with any 'Pizzabrain talk' and that the 'Pizza Slut picture' is 'straight up debunked', 'that is not the same girl'.
           </p>
           <p>
            Could you explain precisely what you think you have debunked and how? And why investigating that blog is a waste of time exactly? What about the Pizza Brain museum or the Little Baby's Ice Cream shop? Is it also a waste of time according to you?
           </p>
           <p>
            By the way, it's not as hard as you pretend to identify disinformation. It's often quite easy actually because the tactics and the narratives chosen by the disinformation agents are really very predictable.

            </p>
            <p>
             Answer - Will Ferrel and Chad Smith DON'T look like the same person to me. They look SIMILAR.

            </p>
            <p>
             Answer - You're baiting me so as to argue over the VERY FIRST PLACE IT WAS EVER POSTED.. I don't like straw men... There are zero connections to Comet on the internet. ZERO. It wasn't first posted to PizzaBrain, so leave them out of this. (source... their own tumble page)

            </p>
            <p>
             Answer - (The girl)...OBVIOUS timeline issues. (Pbrain)... It wasn't FIRST posted by pizzabrain, so They have NOTHING to do with my statement that it isn't the same girl. Trying to prove they are the same girl is a waste of time (is what I said). 
You're setting up arguments that don't exist.

            <p>
             Answer - No- That's what you're saying I said.     Non-existent argument

              So to summarize, they look like clones but at the same time it's 100% not the same girl, because reasons.

             <p>
              Precisely, because you claimed that you know where the picture originates from, but once again you don't provide the source.

             <p>
              The "- Same girl months later..." line is very likely false, yes, but I bet that you would also disagree if the line was "- Same girl months before...", right? That's the thing. I still don't get how you came to the conclusion that it is not the same girl. Care to explain?

             <p>
              As opposed to trying to prove that they aren't the same girl?
             </p>
             <p>
              Do you realize that the sentence (at around 9:35 in your video) which ends up with "don't waste your time with it, OK?" begins with "If you see any Pizzabrain talk"?

            The tape is done very neatly and her sleeves are rolled up in big cuffs. James said that her sister did this taping but in my opinion its far too neat, no wrinkles, long pieces to be done by a kid. Could still be innocent but why did he lie?

            I think it looks like the same girl. It could be the younger sister. He did post a photo of the little girl kissing a newborn at one point. If that is really his goddaughter, then they should be ashamed of him as a godfather for posing her in a Pizza Slut photo while possessing what appear to be photos mocking a child trafficking business and talking about the little girl as though she's a "hotard." Not someone I would want to be the godfather of my child.

            The pizzaslut pic is taken straight ahead, while the "taped down" pic is taken from a standing shot looking downward with no reference to height. Just an observation if others are trying to guess the age.

            That tape holding the girls arms is just masking tape done for fun. I challenge anyone to tape their kid up similarly and I bet they can pull out of the tape easily in just a few seconds, AND HAVE FUN DOING IT.

             Sorry, it's NOT normal for any caregiver/parent to allow their child--or any child for that matter--to be taped to a table for the laughs of the adults.

             You challenge anyone to tape their toddler's wrists to a table?? Post that challenge to your friends on social media, they deserve a warning.
            </p>
            <p>
             No doubt James #49 had FUN DOING IT, he posted the pic. Did SHE have fun? Does she look like she's having fun? Did he ask her? Did her parents permit this? Did he ask them?
            </p>
            <p>
             Since you approve of this behavior, and excuse it as "fun," I guess you also approve of taping a toddler's wrists to a table,
             <strong>
              taking a picture of her in that position
             </strong>
             (with a man standing behind her)
             <strong>
              then broadcasting that picture on non-private social media - with no explanation?
             </strong>
             Normal people don't find this shit funny. Even one of his friends says: "This is pretty creepy bro" in the comments. James Alefantis deserves scrutiny for a lot of things, and this is one of them.

              My wife is a "mandatory reporter" in Washington State (due to her job). I showed her the pic. She asked if it's been reported. I fill her in, and let her know the situation. She tells me that she would be legally obliged to report this if she saw this in Washington.

            girl taped to table pic (says 126 weeks ago, or about ~May, 2014):
            <a href="http://archive.is/9FN8n">

            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            So the table-tape photo was posted about 1.5 years after the pizza-slut photo.  The girls in the pics don't seem that different in age to me.  They look to be close in age.  Not saying it's the same girl, but I don't think we can conclusively say it isn't, either.  Also, is it possible for an instagram photo to be posted at a date/time after the picture was taken?

             Is it possible? REALLY. Yes. You can post any photo in your possession to Instagram at any time. That looks to me like the same girl, but only her godfather would know. It's probably the same girl and the ages are not that different. James posts whatever the fuck he wants to post. Nothing to stop him from posting an older photo. I posted a photo of my 10 year old today from when he was about 4. But to me, as someone who has a ton of experience with kids (I used to teach that age range) the girl taped to the table looks about 3 or 4 and the girl in the pizza slut shirt looks between 2 and 5. It's hard to tell for sure because of the size of the pizza slut shirt. Does anyone still think that could be Lisa Irwin?
