<p>Back in the 70\'s , PAN (pizza) and (pizza) PIE came up in another child endangerment trafficking and exploitation case....actually a series of cases in one network. An international network over 30,000 members strong. The man in the center was John Stamford and he printed an international tourist magazine called Spartacus. The magazine was the cover for the Spartacus boy-love network, a means by which a vast amount of people molested children, bought children, exchanged materials of the trade, counseled each other, provided public establishments for activity, etc.
The People noticed encoded messages in the magazine orientated toward pedophilia.  The ads looked un-extraordinary to the average eye, to a pedophile it was a diamond mine, to vigilant citizens especially parents hearing small talk about school teachers priests elected officials,  it was a call to arms.  People were furious. They encouraged Interpol for 13 years to investigate. High level people  told those people they were seeing things that are not really there.  He was eventually arrested, however, John Stamford died conveniently in jail just before he was to be indicted. However, after his death, more and more establishments were shut down found guilty of partaking in the ring. The ring had clients globally. READ more here about what PIE and PAN meant to pedophiles in the 70\'s.<br />
Also ritual activity (including religion) is a socially acceptable means by which a person with morbid dispositions can engage with children.
All that is allowed for evil to prevail is for good men to do nothing.</p>',
