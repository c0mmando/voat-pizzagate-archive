              Everyone needs to be held accountable, regardless of religion, race, color, gender, etc. A hard lesson I recently learned is that I'm not being racist by calling out groups of people intent on continuing to control the planet. Nobody gets a pass. Nobody.

                I often imagine the people here on this sub standing together in one room, face to face for the first time. I bet there would be lots of surprises as everyone's preconceived assumptions are tested. Some things wouldn't be surprises at all. Many of us would probably have nothing to do with each other in "the real world" while others would become lifelong best friends. But I'd like to think that if we could somehow lower our collective defenses and be honest and keep in mind what our ultimate goal is for each of us (minus the shills' goals-- they can go to hell) which is to stop the raping and kidnapping and organ harvesting and killing of children (and adults) we would have a whole lot less disagreements.

                 Absolutely!

                <p>
                 Just today, I got a message from someone accusing me of threatening another poster, which is complete nonsense--I would never do that of course. It begs the following questions, who would do that and what purpose does it serve? And what is the purpose of accusing people who did not even comment to that person? It's kids on the playground or trolls who need to be ignored. It made me feel sick really, because this kind of subversion is what turns serious, sincere people away from this site and makes it hard to expose the evil that abounds.
                </p>
                <p>
                 It is amazing that people even on this site are so easily turned away from the real issues--as you described so well in your last sentence above.

            ~Following the initial allegations, The Trentonian interviewed Chinn’s wife, Ruth, who called the charges “ridiculous.” She told the newspaper that she recalled the 2012 incident in question, and said that “a bunch of kids” were in the couple’s basement for a youth program when one of the boys screamed in pain from an apparent leg cramp, and thinks her husband massaged the boy’s foot to work the cramp out.
           </p>
           <p>
            “It’s on the bottom of your foot. Nowhere near anything private,” she told The Trentonian, which reported that the Chinns have six children. &gt;
