            To call the occult some general ritualistic weirdness is misrepresenting the effects it has on the world. This isn't the first generation of human beings to ever sacrifice on the altar of Moloch. To understand that, the name Moloch is a take off of the name Malik, meaning King, and it means the evil king, the tyrant, etc. When God is Malik then the Devil is Moloch, like an imitation to usurp the glory, which is the essence of satanism and idolatry. It's about the perversion of truth into the opposites.

            No that's pretty accurate.

            Food references that don't make sense.   Podesta obsession with pizza.   Tony collects pedophilic artwork and artwork involving cannibalism and of children being murdered.   Tony close friends with pedo Denny Hastert.   John and Tony close friends with Alefantis.   Alefantis and friends make numerous sexual comments about kids and babies on Instagram.    Amanda Kleinman has music video featuring images of kids and babies dressed up as pizza, chuck e cheese, "sugar babies" outfits etc intercut with images of sex and sexual torture.   Both Podestas and Elafantis linked to Abramovic, who has pedophilic magazine spreads (pointing at baby girl's vagina, touching shirtless boy), along with cannibal theme in "artwork".    Elafantis linked to Arun Rao at DOJ in charge of investigating child porn.   Sasha lord at Comet specializes in working with "at risk" girls in prison.   Police sketches unearthed of Podesta brothers linked to disappearance of Maddie McCann and pedophile Clem Freud in Portugal.  John's emails wiped at date of disappearance.    Hillary's former chief of staff (Luzzatto) found making bizarre references to children including "raw and uncut" time alone with them.
           </p>
           <p>
            From that point dozens of new leads have been found, often involving bushiness or NGO's involved in anti-trafficking networks or helping "troubled youth" that have pedo symbols for their logos.    Even if suspicious about Alefantis are unfounded (which I find very implausible) the effort is expanding into a global crowd sourced investigation into elite pedo rings and child trafficking.

            Not sure what circles you run in but I've never made pedophilic "jokes" when friends and relatives send pics of their kids.    Not once let alone multiple times.

           <p>
            The term "conspiracy theory" is a propaganda device.   It is typically used by either shills or people who are incredibly naive about the way the world works.
           </p>
           <p>
            Edit: the "jumping off point" Is arguably much earlier.   Dozens of elite pedo rings uncovered in other countries (and at least two in the US -- See Franklin coverup and Jeffrey Epstein), providing context for Pizza Gate and pattern of authorities covering up for elite pedos rather than bringing them to justice.   Widely assumed that these rings are being used for blackmail purposes and keeping people in line.

             Gah! Caught me. Caught the shill, good man. Now the shill is revealed and shall be paraded through the square as an animal as the public shouts, SHILL, SHILL BE GONE. All because of you. Take my praise.

             I'm just messing. But yeah, at the moment, I'm not even remotely interested in this "everywhere" you mentioned. I was there, I learned some,  and now I'm "here" for things I didn't learn. You  probably noticed I didn't come to this page and made a post titled, "Pizzagate?" I'm also not currently up to "searching". That's why I came here to this site. It's a place for people to discuss, question and ask. And for some it's a place to scream "shill" at people like a man with a cardboard sign on the street.

            1) the GQ article that listed Alefantis also said that the people who run the Washington Post weather blog, and a bunch of party planners, and Jose Andres (another restauranteur) were also in the top 50, so i dunno how seriously it makes sense to take it.  It seems like they just wanted some people mixed in who were not all politicos. Also, it's a fucking mens fashion magazine.
