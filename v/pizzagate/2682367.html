<p>His father Torleaf Benestad in 1978 was indicted and convicted of misappropriation of banking funds, the bank he worked  for ( and had a financial stake in) failed becoming at that time the 4th largest bank failure in the US (30 to 40 million dollars). Did no jail time, just paid a fine.

<p>The Bank ABT of NY was owned 76% by a Geneva Bank. ABT loaned over half of their capital to a David Gravier of Argentina so he could buy ABT. (He was the son of Polish Jews who emigrated to Argentina in the 1930s) Gravier funneled the money to his Belgian Bank which funneled it to him. The Belgian bank went broke too. Gravier conveniently &quot;died&quot; in a jet crash in Mexico (no recorder found, no investigation made).https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Graiver
ABT went belly up, FDIC paid off the depositors, everybody happy. A Jewish bank bought ABT. </p>
<p>It is alleged that the money Gravier used to invest with came from ransom money paid in Argentina to the Montoneros:
Argentine reports say that Mr. Graiver invested $17 million for the leftist‐Peronist Montonero guerrillas and gave money to prominent figures in the Peronist movement.https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Montoneros
( Not just home grown thugs donated to Peron, it\'s alleged the absconding Nazi gold went to Evita Peron\'s Swiss account for safekeeping after the war:https://consortiumnews.com/2013/03/16/evita-the-swiss-and-the-nazis/)</p>
<p>&quot;Torleaf Benestad, 61, of Clapboard Road, Green Farms, Conn., who was director and senior executive vice President of the American Bank and Trust Company until 1976, when he became a consultant to the Banque pour l\'Amerique du Sud.&quot; The latter bank was Gravier\'s Belgian Bank (he also owned a bank in Israel)</p>
<p>So  Msgr. Benestad\'s father worked for an Argentinian Jewish banker who allegedly laundered money for a Peronista gang of thugs who kidnapped and collected ransoms: </p>
<p>&quot;The Montoneros financed their operations by kidnapping and collecting ransoms for businessmen or executives, making as much as $14.2 million in 1974 in an abduction of an Exxon executive. 
1974  kidnapped the two brothers of the Bunge and Born family business.They demanded and received a ransom of $60 million in cash, as well as $1.2 million worth of food and clothing to be given to the poor. According to the Guinness Book of Records, this ransom is the highest ever paid.&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Montoneros</p>
<p>Pope Francis is an Argentinian and while a priest in Argentina under Peronista/military  rule:</p>
<p>&quot;But the most damning claims came from journalist Horacio Verbitsky, in his 2005 book about Church complicity in the Dirty War, El Silencio. He claims that in 1979, Bergoglio conspired to hide the disappeared detainees at the ESMA from a visiting delegation of the Inter-American Human Rights Commission.  <a href="https://countervortex.org/node/12088">https://countervortex.org/node/12088</a></p>
<p>1970\'s Catholic Church,Argentina, money laundering recycled in the 1980s and 1990s as &quot;Papal Foundation&quot; run by alleged pedophile msgr , son of an old player from the 1970s? for the benefit of an Argentine Pope? </p>
<p>Maybe this financial legerdemain trickery is inherited ? because Msgr Benestad gets appointed first director of the Papal Foundation  &quot;The organization’s trust fund had grown from nothing in 1988 to $47 million by 1999, the Journal reported&quot;

            Yes, he still lives in Florida.  I hope it won't be long before they start questioning him about his past crimes.  The Vatican surely will step in to protect him as they have done before.  The more we keep posting about him and the others the better.  Waking People is our job on here.
