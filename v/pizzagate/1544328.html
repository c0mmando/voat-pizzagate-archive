<p>Just to give you some context, the condition upon which the Moroccans agreed to host the meeting was her participation. If hrc was not part if it, meeting was a non-starter.
CGI also wasn\'t pushing for a meeting in Morocco and it wasn\'t their first choice.
This was HRC\'s idea, our office approached the Moroccans and they 100 percent believe they are doing this at her request. The King has personally committed approx $12 million both for the endowment and to support the meeting.
It will break a lot of china to back out now when we had so many opportunities to do it in the past few months.
She created this mess and she knows it.</p>

             Sandra said she received no money from the Clinton Foundation and, in fact, took out a large bank loan at its urging. Paying this loan proved to be a tremendous burden, she said. Even worse, within months the head of the Acceso project told her that she should no longer deal directly with buyers. Instead, she would sell her fish directly to Acceso — at sharply reduced prices — and Acceso would resell them. In other words, the Clinton Foundation would act as a middleman and profit from margins supplied by the people it was supposed to be helping. Sandra and eight other Acceso participants immediately dropped out, she said, worried that “if we had stayed with them, we would have gone out of business.”

             Thank you. I will read these soon. I feel like I am the only one who is irrate about all of the financial morass and refusal to indict any of the fuckers criminally. The podesta wife, Mary is an SEC lawyer. Naturally the "charities" have carte blanche also when the wall street co.s are gifted billions (or is it trillions) in reward for criminal behavior.

            Charles Ortel says the biggest fraud org of the CF is USAID.

            Edit:  adding a link to one of Ortel's interviews:  "Charles Ortel-Clinton Foundation $100 Billion Criminal Conspiracy"

            There are lots of them on YT, radio and tv interviews.  Everyone should hear at least one of his interviews!
           </p>
           <p>
            Somewhat related to this thread is this article from 1 1/2 yrs ago, that someone posted could possibly help identify the 1,100 big donors to the CF.

            I think this is PG related, but if mods don't think so, I guess it could be removed.
"Former senator Richard G. Lugar (Ind.), who as the senior Republican on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee quizzed Hillary Clinton during her 2009 confirmation hearings about potential conflicts stemming from foundation fundraising around the world, said Tuesday that he considered such undisclosed donations to violate the spirit of the ethics agreement.
           </p>
           <p>
            “Clearly, there was an expectation and a commitment that large donations to the Clinton Foundation would be disclosed,” Lugar said via e-mail.
           </p>
           <p>
            A spokeswoman for the Canadian group said the majority of the 1,100 donors gave small, one-time gifts while attending a 2008 fundraising gala.
           </p>
           <p>
            A spokesman for the Clinton Foundation said the agreement did not apply to the Canadian organization, which is a separate charity based in Vancouver. The spokesman compared the group to other major charities that provide funding to the Clinton Foundation but do not themselves disclose all their donors, such as Partners in Health and the Nature Conservancy."

             It'd be a shame if the mods dropped this one IMO. These large chunks of money being handed from states to CF/CGI are clearly for various forms of pay to play. At this point, it's quite reasonable that if trafficking is happening, some of this money funds it.

             Thanks for the artlcle. I think it is pg related, in any case it comes from the podesta emails. These large donations from recipients of USAID are probably payments for weapons or trafficked humans, or shakedowns against regime change. It is systemic corruption that us citizens are paying for.

            Here's another one- USAID &gt; Digicel &gt; Clinton Foundation.
            <br/>
            Digicel won a
            <a href="https://www.usaid.gov/news-information/press-releases/gates-foundation-and-us-government-give-25-million-prize">
             $2.5 M contract
            </a>
            in 2012 to "provide mobile banking" in Haiti, via their cell phone service. They received that grant by the Haiti Mobile Money Initiative, funded by the Gates Foundation and USAID.
            <br/>
            Digicel and it's head Denis O'Brien have donated between
            <a href="https://www.clintonfoundation.org/contributors?category=%2410%2C000%2C001+to+%2425%2C000%2C000">
             $10 - 25 M
            </a>
            "in cumulative lifetime giving," including donating in the last quarter of 2016.
            <br/>
            There is probably a ton of these! You could get a bunch just from their time in Haiti.

             I think there is a huge string of emails between Huma and others during the Haiti time, proving that the Friend's of Bill got pushed to the top of the heap when it came to handing out State Department contracts there.
