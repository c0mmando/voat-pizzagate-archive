<blockquote>
<p>An accused Australian child predator and fugitive who went by the nickname “Wombats” is locked up in an Oklahoma jail accused of <strong>sexually assaulting children in Australia, the US and possibly Europe.</strong></p>
<p>Oklahoma authorities said <strong>Trevor Rombouts’ youngest alleged victim was a two-week-old baby</strong> in Victoria.</p>
<p>The 52-year-old <strong>has been on the run since Victorian police issued warrants for his arrest in the late 1990s.</strong></p>
<p>“This clearly is a predator,” Detective Lieutenant Jillian Phippen, of the Tulsa Police Department’s special victims unit in Oklahoma, told AAP on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Tulsa detectives began investigating Rombouts last year when a victim in Oklahoma came forward to say Rombouts had assaulted her for several years when she was younger.</p>
<p>Lt Phippen said the investigation found Rombouts followed the same <strong>predatory pattern of moving in with women who had young children and then assaulting the children.</strong></p>
<p>Two of Rombouts’ alleged US victims were in Oklahoma. A third was in Texas.</p>
<p>“Once we started looking at it my detective was like, ‘there’s going to be more victims just because of his behaviour and how he was treating the victim’,” Lt Phippen said.</p>
<p>“Once he started diving into the investigation that’s what happened. We found more victims who were able to come forward and tell their story. We reached out to Australia where he lived and we received information back saying he had been looked at there for child molestation as well.&quot;</p>
<p>“Our red flags went up and we knew this was a predator and he was not going to stop.”</p>
<p>The investigation also found Rombouts had lived in Europe and <strong>he might have victims in Belgium,</strong> Lt Phippen said.</p>
<p>They tracked Rombouts down in Joplin, Missouri on Monday and took him into custody.</p>
<p>The Australian warrants from the 1990s relate to the <strong>alleged abuse of three children aged five-years-old, four-years-old and a baby just two-weeks-old.</strong></p>
<p>Tulsa prosecutors have charged Rombouts with two counts of child sexual abuse and two counts of lewd molestation.</p>

             Very, very, very, very slowly. Even flaying him alive would be too good for him, but it'd be included for sure if I had anything to say about it.

            Why must women just have to have a man around all the time. I get the money thing but many have had bfs that end up molesting the Children. Pedos seek out single Moms for a reason. Sadly It’s not to be with them.

             Women need a man around. It's biological. They need the person who can make decisions and protect them if a bear attacks.
            </p>
            <p>
             Our current civilizations flirting with female "empowerment" is only proving this more by the day. Even when the woman has her own (or government) income, she still wants a man for the fact that having a man around is hard wired into her. Men and women complement each other. Men need someone more able to focus on the home and details. Women need someone able to cut through the bullshit of life and get things done.

              I agree.  But many let them get way too close to their Children before they really get to l ow them. Moving in also bad until you case them out. It just happens way too quick.

             Don't you dare blame single mothers. None of this is their fault. Why don't you look at all the husbands who rape their daughters. There have been lots of them. In the old days there were faggots who actually married women to hide being gay (ditto for lesbians) and give access to other people's sons.  Then there is all the Christian clergy who raped kids. Ditto for scout leaders. Are married parents to blame for what they did? Why don't you try thinking before you type next time nimrod.

              You are right about those things. I agree. I worked with Children for years and the parents and I saw a lot. Didn’t say all single Moms were like that. Just said Some. I saw many with different guys every week and had one in the family too. I have the highest respect All Mothers. Especially those pulling the load all by themselves.

               Not all children are sold into the sex trade by fathers. Most successful child actors have a mother who is the pimp. Not at first, the blackmail and extortion comes from honey pots to set up anyone the parent loves or are attached to.

               Then the Pedo-Blackmail intensifies. This is how Bill Cosby and Epstein got repeat "freebies". By showing them the pictures and videos they did while drugged. Thing is they are wide awake yet can't remember fucking the dog or pet snake. The fact they "look" pleased is what horrifies them. They become a commodity.

                 Most of the horrendous sex crimes are locked down due to draconian Privacy laws and the obvious "Child" victim protections in place. Thing is once the child is of legal age the court will NOT release the files because most, if not all have multiple victims. Some who are missing but not declared dead.
                </p>
                <p>
                 Privacy laws do more to protect Predators than any victim who committed suicide because of the second rape from Judicial Malpractice.
