Breach in Public Safety Overseen by Scott Walker Puts Sex Predators in Positions Where They Could Strike Again</p>
<p>MADISON, Wis. — A report in the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel reveals Scott Walker’s administration approved professional licenses to pedophile priests for the last eight years. According to One Wisconsin Now Executive Director Scot Ross, this previously unreported public safety breach explains why Walker and his special interest allies ran millions of dollars in ads lying about his opponent Tony Evers.
“Scott Walker was responsible for pedophiles getting licenses for the last eight years and Scott Walker hoped no one found out before the election,” said Ross. “Scott Walker is the only one in this race who had the ability to protect our kids from pedophiles getting these licenses from the state of Wisconsin. Scott Walker failed our kids.”
According to the story:</p>
<p>“… it turns out that the second-term Republican governor’s administration has its own serious lapse involving the professional licenses of individuals of highly questionable character.
“Records show one of Walker’s agencies — the state Department of Safety and Professional Services — either gave licenses to or renewed the licenses of four ex-priests who were defrocked for sexually abusing children.
“The four former pedophile priests from the Milwaukee Archdiocese were given state approval to practice such professions as social work, nursing, alcohol and drug counseling and funeral work. All four appear on the archdiocese’s list of former Milwaukee priests with a “substantiated case of sexual abuse of a minor.”
Ross noted that while attorneys general working across the country are working to expose abuse and the abusers, Republican Attorney General Brad Schimel is sitting on the sidelines, while Scott Walker’s administration is giving out professional licenses that put these predators in positions where they can offend again.
He concluded, “Scott Walker doesn’t care about our kids, only winning the election. Otherwise, he would have already ordered Brad Schimel to open an investigation so we could find out how many licenses to pedophiles Scott Walker’s administration has handed out the last eight years.”

            Records show one of Walker's agencies — the state Department of Safety and Professional Services — either gave licenses to or renewed the licenses of four ex-priests who were defrocked for sexually abusing children.
           </p>
           <p>
            The four former pedophile priests from the Milwaukee Archdiocese were given state approval to practice such professions as social work, nursing, alcohol and drug counseling and funeral work. All four appear on the archdiocese's list of former Milwaukee priests with a "substantiated case of sexual abuse of a minor."
           </p>
           <p>
            After learning of the issue this week, Walker moved to strip the four of their state credentials.
           </p>
           <p>
            "The governor believes they should lose their licenses," said Walker spokesman Tom Evenson.
           </p>
           <p>
            In 2012, two of the ex-priests had complaints lodged against them over the accusations that forced them from their ministry. But state officials dismissed both complaints.
           </p>
           <p>
            One of the pedophile ex-priests was hired by the state Department of Corrections more than a decade ago under Democratic Gov. Jim Doyle and continued to work there as a $50,000-per-year substance abuse counselor until last year. That former associate pastor, who served five Milwaukee-area parishes over 22 years, was found to have molested two girls, ages 9 and 12, while binding the hands and feet of one of them. He claimed they were engaged in a "form of play."
           </p>
           <p>
            He said officials at the state licensing agency have initiated complaints against the four pedophile ex-priests. They were sent letters this week informing them of this action and stating that they can voluntarily surrender their licenses to avoid investigation by state regulators
           </p>
           <p>
            Ultimately, that decision is left up to the boards that are legally charged with overseeing them," Evenson said. The governor appoints the members of those boards as well as the top officials at the Safety and Professional Services Department.

            Hard to blame Walker specifically on this.  It's the dept that issues the licenses.
