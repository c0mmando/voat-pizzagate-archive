           <p>
            This case is sickening. To think it happened in Wisconsin in the US needs action.

            You can read how the nation of Israel dealt with them in Judges19-22. They basically about killed one of their 12 tribes off over it but I doubt they would do that now. People are too weak anymore! Judges 19-22 shows us how bad it is and that it needs to be eridicated to be gotten rid of evidently. It is an interesting subject, whether God would allow us to handle like this or not? Definitely serious stuff!!!

            Thanks for this post :) - I posted this last week on VOAT but they deleted it saying it was anti-catholic rhetoric!  I am glad you managed to keep this Submission on VOAT.  This is a TRUE STORY about the Horrific Life Experience of A Nun - and my Own Short Experience? -  Satanic Ritual Abuse of a Nun -
            <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKTguPpBWicYouTubeYouTube">
             https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKTguPpBWicYouTubeYouTube
            </a>
            -  This is the most unbelievable testimony, is anything being done about these illegal activities? I am totally shocked at the cruelty inflicted on the nuns in this nuns testimony! As a little girl of 7, I was put into a Catholic Orphanage here in the UK, because of a breakdown in my parents marriage. I remember the nuns being so cruel, especially to my little sister aged 6 for wetting the bed, they also used to hit me in the night with a long bamboo cane for making any noise or not being able to go to sleep. Thank God my mom and dad got together again and we managed to ‘get out’ of that place.

             Thanks for sharing that nuns testimony it is really incredible what humans can do to others in the name of God. That is not God who they serve it is evil and she elequently explains that.
Thx 4 sharing a little of your story as well it sheds light on what happens to children that are removed from homes. There should be safe places but they rarely are.

              Thanks for the reply, yes there should be some kind of independent, no connection with the organisations, inspections and separate interviews with the children for freedom to talk.  For years if I saw a nun I would think, what a hypocrite because of my experience.

            This case has been talked about on this forum and Everytime I read more information the rage inside of me burns with more intensity. These children were not only deaf most were mute as well so could not utter a scream during their rape &amp; torture. Not that it mattered their was no one that could hear them cry that cared.
           </p>
           <p>
            The thought of that nun making a victim wear a diaper because he/she was hemorraging after being raped is so appalling and so evil it is beyond my ability to grasp.
           </p>
           <p>
            The fact that Pope Francis personally intervened and stopped any judicial action against the Priest waving his crimes and sentencing him to pray everyday is so outrageous.
           </p>
           <p>
            Of course Pope Francis makes those disgusting comments about researcher like us being like Sjit" and pizzagate/pedogate being "fakenews" My god he just excused a monster involved in pedogate in the fall and he has the nerve to accuse us and state this is all fake news.
           </p>
           <p>
            Well Pope Francis I am here to tell you something you are a Fake Pope. You stand for nothing except protection of the guilty and powerful against the weak and vulnerable. Your charities are a fraud.
           </p>
           <p>
            Let the good people of this world take over these investigations. Independent researchers in the past 6 months have solved more crimes than than the full force of government institutions.

            Since the church doesn't want to defrock or excommunicate and the sentences will be minimal I really cannot help but have violent thoughts about these abusers and helpers or abuse (whom are JUST AS BAD!). I have been criticized here on voat for expressing this and I cannot help feeling this way none the less. I am obviously not in a position to act on my feelings but boy if I was...Yall might need a crowd funded bail program for me. If the governments aren't gonna do it may people like us should. There must be something we as civilians can do that wont get us arrested but will make a very SOLID POINT THAT WE ARE ON TO THE ABUSERS. Thoughts?

            This is the continuing saga of abuse of children by the Catholic Church over more than 2,000 years.
           </p>
           <p>
            These pedophiles are cowards taking advantage of young children who cannot defend themselves, especially against priests who the children associate with God.
           </p>
           <p>
            In Canada, in order that the Catholic Church could take in more money from the government, the Catholic Church hand children in their care labelled as "retarded."

            Crimens Solicitationis was the brain child of Ratzinger.  Bergoglio allowed the abuse of many by priests while he looked the other way and also allowed babies to leave the country illegally.  Yes Bergoglio now occupies the Vatican and Ratzinger is safely locked behind the gates of a fortress to keep him safe.  I am sure the Mafia is happy to keep guard.

            I agree. It is a great way to spread the word to wider audience. We should all be commenting in as many places as we can, and include links.

             It's just incredible--the whole thing going on for so long too.
            </p>
            <p>
             Dec. 2016 Pope Francis gave a
             <strong>
              message in sign language
             </strong>
             talking about his prayer "punishment" for the priests along with the importance of mercy. Ironic, to say the least.
