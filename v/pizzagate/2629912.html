            She should have never been arrested. She is a feature entertainer in that club and Ohio law states that its only regularly nude ("employees" but strippers at least are never called that in a strip club for sketchy tax reasons) with the exception of close relatives (how very incestuousy of you Ohio GROSSSS!) This may (though DOUBTFUL) have had to do with human trafficking but it would have been the club itself and she doesnt work there! I believe that it was a setup to embarrass her and tarnish her reputation if that is possible. That boob slapping thing is a typical feature dancer move and one that requires money whilst doing it so she was hardly molesting people without their consent or contract by payment if you will. I believe that the cops were trying to save face by bringing up the human trafficking angle because its such a hot button topic at the moment. I mean if it was a real investigation would they really plaster so in the media?! It is supposedly the only arrests using that law in YEARS. This is certainly why its already dismissed as they know her lawyer wouldnt just let that go too much is at stake right now.
           </p>

            I am still riding the fence and believe there is some truth to the NEXIVM connection that being said better to keep Ms Daniels as an ally than to spread the fake news and possibly turn her off to helping out with the investigation. She is NO Ranerie or Mack but may have plenty of secrets to share about them in their recruitment process. I am a believer in PG in the nexivm connection but I think that this was nothing more than a shitty vice cop copping a feel and trying to be "that cop" that arrested her for a routine that she has done hundreds of times before. She wouldnt be stupid enough to break serious laws in public right now. Her cash cow depends on keeping the victim persona right now. Its simply not worth it. Just my .02 yall...Peace.

             yer look I certainly dont discount that the accusation of 'Human Trafficking' may start to become a catch-all authoritarian over-reach by conservative aligned authorities. All I'm saying in this post is that there was a document posted on Twitter purportedly from the police dept that arrested Stormy saying it was 'human trafficking' related.  Doesnt necessarily mean i blindly place faith in conjecture about what that precisely means in Stormy's situation.

              Well even if you look back at her post that said...I THINK I JUST JOINED A CULT it could be read as an amount of uncertainty. An easy nut to crack if you will and one that may have insider knowledge they gave her in hopes of her moral compass being as fucked up as theirs. One can hope...

            So let me get this straight. Stormy Daniels, who previously publicly accused Trump of sexual harassment etc., is now implicated and arrested as being involved in child trafficking? What's the matter with this picture? As someone who doesn't believe the Q message that Trump is a clean victim of the Deep state who is secretly fighting child sex trafficking, this immediately raised a red flag for me. Does anyone else see it? What is being presented as true and what is true are two entirely different things.

            there were undercover cops there as part of a human trafficking investigation and she just happened to be there performing. Her arrest was not related to trafficking by her. She is touring the country as America's favorite stripper and porn star, so she thinks, and in support of sex workers. Bear in mind she is a mother and wife. If you google her name and add nude photos you will come across a vast array of  sordid pictures that would have made Hugh Hefner blush. She is  "hard core" and proud of it.
           </p>
           <p>
            She had no reason to expose Trump until he became an even greater  public figure and now she wants to capitalize on it.

            Some anons went thru her twitters and found a old comment she that she thinks she has just linked up with  a cult or something like a cult and seemed to be joking about it.  The picture of the alleged branding shows a scar of sorts obscured by a tatoo....truth will out.

             That story was completely destroyed.   The claim was she had a NXVIM brand.   It was a ridiculous theory.

              She had no reason to expose Trump until he became an even greater public figure and now she wants to capitalize on it. How I wish he could have turned the tables on her.

            <p>
             How would he have turned the tables on her?   Expose that he cheated on his pregnant wife?  What did you have in mind?
            </p>
            <p>
             Also she actually told InTouch magazine in 2011 that she slept with Trump.  But they didn't publish it.

             I don't know how you much you have looked into this, but what did you think of the fact that Michael Cohen and her lawyer seemed to be colluding against her, that her lawyer wasn't actually representing her interests, but colluding against her.
            </p>
            <p>
             What did you think of the many lies Cohen and Trump told about this payoff before admitting the truth?

            <p>
             I think Stormy is not even going to be the most damaging payoff Cohen made.  The Shera Bechard story when it comes out is going to be a blockbuster.

              sorry to take so long to reply, i had to look up the other gal. I think they are all sleazeballs..Im a strong proponent of Kiss and Dont Tell even before the money came to play. Approx 40% of marital partners cheat. Those who are hurt the most when disclosure occurs  are the children. Stormy is not  a golf affionado, shes into horses but she shows up at this tournament, gets a photo op and then finds herself in bed with him.when she later told Cooper she wasnt attracted tonhim. So why do you have a one night stand  with someone you are not attracted to? She said she hoped he wouldnt offer money  like a prostitute. But he did make a casual offer to help out with her career. (rumor has it that a guy will say anything if he thinks its foreplay. )  Much later she enters into a nondisclorsure contract  and accepts a pretty nice sum for one night of work. Now shes all indignant that he is a liar ( what else is new)  and she wantsto tell her story to protect the American public from liars . In the meantime Barron and his innocent mother have to  hear and see all.this and be humiliated in public .  Ask a child psychologist if mental harm.occurs from such shenanigans. View her nude photos on the Internet and see what Barron's friends have already seen. They are disgusting.

              Human trafficking now includes what used to be called regular old solicitation or prostitution.  They could have been investigating prostitution at that strip club.  The cops admit there was a long term investigation going on.
