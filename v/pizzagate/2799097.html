            That thread was awful to read. The guy sounds legit and I'm glad he's doing reasonably well considering what he's been through. He had no parents at home and I can relate to that. He raised himself and he survived, but he sounds dead inside.

            'Memes aside, Is there anything that you've learned from your unfortunate captivity that you'd be able to pass on? Like any general behaviours to avoid from people that pedophiles seem to have in particular? 
Parents need to spend more time with their kids. A large part of why I didn't care to try to escape was because my parents preferred to do their own thing when I was little. If you have kids, you HAVE to forge that bond if you don't want to leave them vulnerable to this kind of shit.'

             Children need to be taught from an early age to scream and run if someone touches them or starts the conditioning. My cousin's mother did that and it saved him from her brother's plans.

            I have read most of it.  The psychologist who told him that boys/males can't be raped should  not be allowed to counsel anyone.
           </p>
           <p>
            He sounds pretty legit.  He's been groomed and conditioned.
           </p>
           <p>
            People should remember that children who are sexually abused &amp; rape often do not object and enjoy some part of it.  But that doesn't mean it's not rape.  It's always rape because children do not have the ability to know what they're consenting to.  The grooming starts off by talking about intimate things, then touching and tickling, getting closer to private body parts. The 'cuddling' turns into other things.  That is why anyone who's been abused as a child has such shame.  It's shame because you may have physically reacted to the touching. A boy might get an erection but that doesn't mean he is will to have sex with someone.  This is how 'sex workers' are made, as most were abused as kids.
           </p>
           <p>
            The abuse has changed his brain. He can't view the world the way people with normal, loving childhoods do. The trust issue is HUGE.   There'd be lots of abandonment issues with being taken from his family.  The hate he feels for the people who abducted him is mixed with love for the little love they did show him.   That's why this stuff really messes with your head.

             That is an excellent description.
            </p>
            <p>
             I Read through that entire thread and I have no doubt it is legitimate.
            </p>
            <p>
             I knew about a dozen guys who were in NAMBLA (they were incarcerated at the time). Without exception, they ALL experienced what they considered "loving" attention from older men that incorporsted sexual activities.
As such, the conflation between caring and physical pleasure become intertwined.
            </p>
            <p>
             This is a prime reason organizations such as Boystown and Sandusky's Second Mile foundation provide fertile hunting/grooming grounds for these perpetrators.
            </p>
            <p>
             There is actually a biological component to this as the physical nerve system responds to these activities in developing youth.

              Yes, of the women who are lesbians, most have been sexually abused in childhood.  I would say that a large proportion of gay men were sexually abused as kids too.  This is why I think that we are not necessarily born heterosexual or gay, but it often depends on our first sexual experience.

              Kids from vulnerable backgrounds are easy pickings, because their hearts are aching to be loved. They also have no one to protect them. Predators know this.

             The saddest part is feeling misunderstood for one’s entire life. For wanting to marry a partner who can fix you but knowing full well that a normal person doesn’t know what to fix in the first place, nor how badly you need fixing. Abandonment issues are there without even realizing it. So sad bc the harm is irrevocable and the perpetrators know it and do it anyways.

            I need an infusion of the light, the goodness on a God to balance all the evil of Pizzagate and all the rest.  The Jimmy Come- Instagram got me started and the hot dog 65$ GIF.  We need to infuse goodness when we are dealing with evil so bad like this.

            I don't know about this one! He sounds sincere, but when answering the questioned related to how he feels about the hypersexualizatipn of children, his answerws are pretty scary!
           </p>
           <p>
            He admits to being raped analy as a child, which caused him to throw tantrums the next two times that was attempted because he was so scared. But then he says none of his sexual experiences were traumatic in themselves? It's really how society views children and having sex that made him feel bad or ashamed? He says that children having sex isn't inherently bad. Really? This guy sounds like a pedophile. Now maybe that's because he's been so manipulated and abused he can't really see what's "normal" and what isn't. Or maybe because of his abuse he now has those tendencies. Either way this is very sad and I hope he gets some help.

             What I found disturbing are reader comments who ignore the fact that this man is nothing more than a damaged little boy on the inside as they make sexual innuendo’s towards him. How messed up is that!?
            </p>
            <p>
             So far as his attitude that his sexual experiences weren’t traumatic in and of themselves... you have to bear in mind that he seemed to have it pretty easy so far as child sexual slavery goes, you know what I mean? So I think that’s why his attitude is a little more nonchalant than what some of us would expect.

              Your comment shows great understanding..so rare...I see many on this site who have this understanding..as one who had a father who was a pedophile and shared if you know what I mean..it is comforting. Families might try to cover up and pretend it didn't happen...but others are not that way.

              I felt the same way. I know 4chan is full of larp but it made me uncomfortably to see others continuing to sexualize him. On the whole, he has a lot of light still within. Although he is confused and has suffered greatly he has hope for his future. He also sees what is within and chooses not to abuse others or have kids and propagate them. This man was never loved properly, but instinctively he continues to live and seek to improve. That's impressive in my book.

               I think the reason some of those guys are able to make suggestive comments to the OP is that they haven't seen or met an abused child in person or an adult who was abused as a child. You'll never make those kinds of jokes after you have.
              </p>
              <p>
               I was also very disturbed by the OPs thoughts about children having sexual experiences not inherently being bad. It sounds like for him being bad would mean it would have to be scary or cause physical pain. I got the impression he looks back on his time with them ambivalently and even positively.
              </p>
              <p>
               I participated in sexual activity from when I was about 5 or 6 with kids from my school who were about the same age as me. I vaguely remember there was a group of us. I don't associate trauma or pain with those memories but that doesn't mean it wasn't bad. I think back on it and feel angry that it happened.
              </p>
              <p>
               This is why I think only the OP could say it's not inherently bad. But I think his thoughts on this matter are worthless because sadly he does not think like a regular, healthy person. That's just the cold, sad truth of the matter. How can he?
              </p>
              <p>
               He's only 25 and there will be many more years of him trying to process his early years, and I think he's far from out of the woods. There's a reason most pedophile abuse victims kill themselves. I know only too well. I think the OP may yet have many dark days ahead. I'm not optimistic about his future.
              </p>
              <p>
               The pre-teen and early puberty sexual behaviors I engaged in are bad and I now suspect one or more of the kids from my school was being abused by someone in their family and passed on the behaviors to the rest of us 'on the playground' so to speak. I do have one particular memory of a much older girl taking me into the tall grass and pushing me back into the grass. I have no memory of what happened next. Yes. I really fucking wish this didn't happen in my life even though I don't associate trauma with the memories themselves.
              </p>
              <p>
               If I could speak to the OP I'd encourage him to get high-grade help. Just because he's gone 10 years without abusing someone else doesn't mean he won't sometime in the next 50-60 years of his life.

                The 4chan OP will  NEVER  not have arousal potential towards older women, kids, or ANYONE with whom he has been sexual as a youth due, in part, to the fact his nervous system is now hardwired to respond to these stimuli in an erotic manner.
               </p>
               <p>
                Similar to negative PTSD causing dramatic reversion to earlier traumas, orgasm-inducing  events carve permanent pathways in developing youths' brains that never leave.
