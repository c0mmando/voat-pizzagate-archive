<p>WASHINGTON — In the $600 billion annual Defense Department budgets, the $22 million spent on the Advanced Aerospace Threat Identification Program was almost impossible to find.</p>
<p>Which was how the Pentagon wanted it.</p>
<p>For years, the program investigated reports of unidentified flying objects, according to Defense Department officials, interviews with program participants and records obtained by The New York Times. It was run by a military intelligence official, Luis Elizondo, on the fifth floor of the Pentagon’s C Ring, deep within the building’s maze.</p>
<p>The Defense Department has never before acknowledged the existence of the program, which it says it shut down in 2012. But its backers say that, while the Pentagon ended funding for the effort at that time, the program remains in existence. For the past five years, they say, officials with the program have continued to investigate episodes brought to them by service members, while also carrying out their other Defense Department duties.</p>
<p>The shadowy program — parts of it remain classified — began in 2007, and initially it was largely funded at the request of Harry Reid, the Nevada Democrat who was the Senate majority leader at the time and who has long had an interest in space phenomena. Most of the money went to an aerospace research company run by a billionaire entrepreneur and longtime friend of Mr. Reid’s, Robert Bigelow, who is currently working with NASA to produce expandable craft for humans to use in space.</p>
<p>On CBS’s “60 Minutes” in May, Mr. Bigelow said he was “absolutely convinced” that aliens exist and that U.F.O.s have visited Earth.</p>

<p>WASHINGTON — The Trump administration tried to mount a case on Thursday that Iran violated an international agreement to limit its arms dealing, but American officials failed to show how an array of weaponry presented as evidence proved the charges.</p>
<p>Nikki R. Haley, the American ambassador to the United Nations, accused Iran of providing weapons to Houthi rebels in Yemen who toppled the government in Sana, throwing the country into chaos and setting off a proxy war between Iran and Saudi Arabia.</p>
<p>At a military base in Washington, Ms. Haley stood in front of pieces of what defense officials said were Iranian-made Qiam missiles, including one that was fired by Houthi militants at an airport in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. Saudi officials have called that attack an “act of war” by Iran.</p>
<p>“When you look at this missile, this is terrifying, this is absolutely terrifying. Just imagine if this missile had been launched at Dulles Airport or JFK,” Ms. Haley said, naming Washington-area and New York airports, “or the airports in Paris, London or Berlin.”</p>
<p>Ms. Haley said that the weapons on display were declassified by the Pentagon so that the Trump administration could rally other countries to crack down on Iran. Without saying exactly what the administration is seeking, she vowed that “you will see us build a coalition to really push back against Iran and what they’re doing.”</p>
<p>Her accusations were the latest step by the Trump administration’s effort to punish Iran for its ballistic missile program and destabilizing actions throughout the Middle East.</p>
<p>Asked what international agreements Iran was violating, Ms. Haley cited the United Nations Security Council resolution 2231. Passed in 2015, it bars Iran from supplying, selling or transferring certain weapons outside the country unless approved by the Security Council. It also prohibits Iran from transferring weapons capable of delivering nuclear warheads.</p>
<p>But the evidence she showcased at Joint Base Anacostia-Bolling — four weapons provided to the American government by Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates — fell short of proving her claims.</p>
<p>Defense officials said they could not say exactly when the weapons — the Qiam missiles and an anti-tank missile and a drone that were both recovered in Yemen — were given to the Houthis, which means that they could have been transferred before the Security Council resolution was enacted. And in some cases, the officials said that they could not say when the weapons were used.</p>
<p>Defense officials were also unable to say exactly where or when the drone, a broken Qasef-1, was found. It was evidently turned over without its warhead or guidance system.</p>
<p>Additionally, none of the weapons displayed were capable of delivering nuclear warheads, said Jeffrey Lewis, an analyst at the Middlebury Institute of International Studies in Monterey, Calif.</p>
<p>“It’s not a nice thing for Iran to do, but that’s not the standard,” Mr. Lewis wrote in an email, referring to Iran’s transfer of weapons to the Houthi rebels.</p>
<p>Ms. Haley also said that the nuclear deal between Iran and six world powers, including the United States, has failed to curb Tehran’s support for terrorist groups. President Trump has disavowed the deal but has declined to tear it up, as he promised to do during his campaign.</p>

<h2>Further reading: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iran%E2%80%93Saudi_Arabia_proxy_conflict">Iran–Saudi Arabia proxy conflict</a></h2>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Date:</strong> 1979 – present[32][33]</p>
<p><strong>Location:</strong> Middle East, Africa, Central Asia, and South Asia</p>
<p><strong>Status:</strong> Ongoing</p>
<hr />
<p>The Iran–Saudi Arabia proxy conflict (sometimes referred to as the Iran–Saudi Arabia Cold War[62] or the Middle East Cold War)[63] is the ongoing struggle for influence in the Middle East and surrounding regions between the Islamic Republic of Iran and the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.[64] The two countries have provided varying degrees of support to opposing sides in nearby conflicts, including the civil wars in Syria,[65][66][67] Yemen,[68][69] and Iraq.[70] The rivalry also extends to disputes in Bahrain,[71] Lebanon,[72] Qatar,[73] Pakistan,[74][75] Afghanistan,[76][77] and Nigeria,[78][79] as well as broader competition in North Africa,[80] parts of South Asia,[81] and Central Asia.[82][77]</p>
<p>In what has been described as a cold war, the conflict is waged on multiple levels over geopolitical, economic and sectarian influence.[83][84][32][85] American support for Saudi Arabia and its allies along with growing Russian and Chinese support for Iran have drawn comparisons to the Cold War era, and the proxy conflict has been characterized as a front in what Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev has referred to as the &quot;New Cold War.&quot;[86][87][88]</p>

            But the evidence she showcased at Joint Base Anacostia-Bolling — four weapons provided to the American government by Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates — fell short of proving her claims.
           </p>
           <p>
            Defense officials said they could not say exactly when the weapons — the Qiam missiles and an anti-tank missile and a drone that were both recovered in Yemen — were given to the Houthis, which means that they could have been transferred before the Security Council resolution was enacted. And in some cases, the officials said that they could not say when the weapons were used.
           </p>
           <p>
            Defense officials were also unable to say exactly where or when the drone, a broken Qasef-1, was found. It was evidently turned over without its warhead or guidance system.
           </p>
           <p>
            Additionally, none of the weapons displayed were capable of delivering nuclear warheads, said Jeffrey Lewis, an analyst at the Middlebury Institute of International Studies in Monterey, Calif.
           </p>
           <p>
            “It’s not a nice thing for Iran to do, but that’s not the standard,” Mr. Lewis wrote in an email, referring to Iran’s transfer of weapons to the Houthi rebels.
           </p>
           <p>
            Ms. Haley also said that the nuclear deal between Iran and six world powers, including the United States, has failed to curb Tehran’s support for terrorist groups. President Trump has disavowed the deal but has declined to tear it up, as he promised to do during his campaign.

            The Iran–Saudi Arabia proxy conflict (sometimes referred to as the Iran–Saudi Arabia Cold War[62] or the Middle East Cold War)[63] is the ongoing struggle for influence in the Middle East and surrounding regions between the Islamic Republic of Iran and the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.[64] The two countries have provided varying degrees of support to opposing sides in nearby conflicts, including the civil wars in Syria,[65][66][67] Yemen,[68][69] and Iraq.[70] The rivalry also extends to disputes in Bahrain,[71] Lebanon,[72] Qatar,[73] Pakistan,[74][75] Afghanistan,[76][77] and Nigeria,[78][79] as well as broader competition in North Africa,[80] parts of South Asia,[81] and Central Asia.[82][77]
           </p>
           <p>
            In what has been described as a cold war, the conflict is waged on multiple levels over geopolitical, economic and sectarian influence.[83][84][32][85] American support for Saudi Arabia and its allies along with growing Russian and Chinese support for Iran have drawn comparisons to the Cold War era, and the proxy conflict has been characterized as a front in what Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev has referred to as the "New Cold War."[86][87][88]

            Nice work here mate, I need to finish reading but wanted to say I almost posted something about all the recent "alien" stories.  I believe it was FBIanon back in the day who said when the shite hits the fan, the "alien" stories will start emerging to distract people.  Nailed it.
