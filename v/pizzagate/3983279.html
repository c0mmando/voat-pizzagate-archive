The name sounded familiar so I started to dig. Low and behold, our old subud digs showed up. To my horror, Subud and the Heather O’Rourke case may very well be connected.</p>
<p><a href="https://m.imdb.com/name/nm0000794/filmotype/actor?ref_=m_nmfm_1">https://m.imdb.com/name/nm0000794/filmotype/actor?ref_=m_nmfm_1</a> Would you look at that. His last episode of Rocky Road was episode 50, yet his next gig was in 1987. His alibi is VERY weak. It’s possible he could be one of the three men responsible for Heather’s death.</p>

They scream loudly about pizzagate. Subud is probably why. Also attended some of Abramovic’s parties.</p>

I suspect the murder of Alexia Arquette and Monica Peterson may have been ordered by the same people. Likely the Arquette family.</p>

<p>Timeline: </p>
<p>-Poltergeist Series. Three incidents over a period of 5 years ranging from 1982 to summer of 1987. The crimes themselves occured in Simi Valley, California, Culver City, CA, Altadena, CA, and Chicago, Illinois. Suspects: Steven Spielberg, Frank Marshall.</p>
<p>Accomplices: Judy Wix</p>
<p>-Happy Days: Most Likely Suspects: Garry Marshall (dead), Bobby Hoffman (dead), Henry Winkler, Tom Hanks, Rob Reiner. Accomplice: Penny Marshall (dead).</p>
<p>-The Fatal Incident. Note that this incident is the START of Heather\'s fatal down turn rather than a quick death. Location: On the set of Rocky Road. Hollywood, California.</p>
<p>Time: November 7, 1986. The incident backstage involved anally violating her with a foreign object. 3 men were involved. Execs flocked to the studio, so its possible for a culprit to be one of the flockers. A medic was called in likely because what they did perforated her colon. The injury was severe enough that it also inflicted either penetrative or blunt force trauma on her small intestine, more specifically, her ileum. For this reason, I suspect that the object itself was a hard object. Possibly made of metal or some other hard material. I’d say the object in question was about 10-14” long. Heather\'s illness (the one that was covered up) first started to manifest around December 1986. I suspect that the Chrons diagnosis was the cover up. The episode was released in May of 1987. She was on medication throughout filming of Poltergeist 3 as her condition worsened. Heather\'s health took its fatal downward spiral on 1/31/1988 before she died on 2/1/1988. The funeral was an open casket event on 2/5/1988. The &quot;skinning&quot; was most likely on the following night, with the casket being looted. This crime is fully possible because Heather was interred in an above ground mausolium according to accounts of those who attended the funeral. </p>
<p>Suspects (Rocky Road): Gene Abravaya, Arthur Annecharico, Chris Colombus, Richard Vane, Lewis Arquette.</p>
<p>Accomplice (others): Wesley Staples. Corey Feldman. He actively covers for the big pedowood names and their crimes, which would make him an accomplice. Other accomplices include the MSM, Patrick Little and Tom Steyer due to their involvement in the attempted false flag along with Gabe Hoffman for protecting Steven Spielberg. Ted Turner. Fredrick Brennan for deplatforming 8chan, a site that was providing informants in this case. Richard Bretzing.</p>
<p>-Cause of Death: Sepsis infection and intestinal stenosis of the ileum (last 1/3 of small intestine) due to repeated anal rape related injuries and infections. The main incident responsible was the injury to her small intestines as a result of the Rocky Road incident.</p>',

           Very interesting that every episode of Rocky Road is easily accessed EXCEPT the one with Heather O’Rourke. How suspiscious. As if the cover up confirms CDAN’s story.

           While trying to find the episode of Rocky Road in question (episode 64), I found the name Lewis Arquette. The name sounded familiar so I started to dig. Low and behold, our old subud digs showed up. To my horror, Subud and the Heather O’Rourke case may very well be connected.

           Would you look at that. His last episode of Rocky Road was episode 50, yet his next gig was in 1987. His alibi is VERY weak. It’s possible he could be one of the three men responsible for Heather’s death.

           All hits for Arquette here on voat. They scream loudly about pizzagate. Subud is probably why. Also attended some of Abramovic’s parties.

           Hits for Subud here on voat. I suspect the murder of Alexia Arquette and Monica Peterson may have been ordered by the same people. Likely the Arquette family.

           Timeline:
          </p>
          <p>
           -Poltergeist Series. Three incidents over a period of 5 years ranging from 1982 to summer of 1987. The crimes themselves occured in Simi Valley, California, Culver City, CA, Altadena, CA, and Chicago, Illinois. Suspects: Steven Spielberg, Frank Marshall.
          </p>
          <p>
           Accomplices: Judy Wix
          </p>
          <p>
           -Happy Days: Most Likely Suspects: Garry Marshall (dead), Bobby Hoffman (dead), Henry Winkler, Tom Hanks, Rob Reiner. Accomplice: Penny Marshall (dead).
          </p>
          <p>
           -The Fatal Incident. Note that this incident is the START of Heather's fatal down turn rather than a quick death. Location: On the set of Rocky Road. Hollywood, California.
          </p>
          <p>
           Time: November 7, 1986. The incident backstage involved anally violating her with a foreign object. 3 men were involved. Execs flocked to the studio, so its possible for a culprit to be one of the flockers. A medic was called in likely because what they did perforated her colon. The injury was severe enough that it also inflicted either penetrative or blunt force trauma on her small intestine, more specifically, her ileum. For this reason, I suspect that the object itself was a hard object. Possibly made of metal or some other hard material. I’d say the object in question was about 10-14” long. Heather's illness (the one that was covered up) first started to manifest around December 1986. I suspect that the Chrons diagnosis was the cover up. The episode was released in May of 1987. She was on medication throughout filming of Poltergeist 3 as her condition worsened. Heather's health took its fatal downward spiral on 1/31/1988 before she died on 2/1/1988. The funeral was an open casket event on 2/5/1988. The "skinning" was most likely on the following night, with the casket being looted. This crime is fully possible because Heather was interred in an above ground mausolium according to accounts of those who attended the funeral.
          </p>
          <p>
           Suspects (Rocky Road): Gene Abravaya, Arthur Annecharico, Chris Colombus, Richard Vane, Lewis Arquette.
          </p>
          <p>
           Accomplice (others): Wesley Staples. Corey Feldman. He actively covers for the big pedowood names and their crimes, which would make him an accomplice. Other accomplices include the MSM, Patrick Little and Tom Steyer due to their involvement in the attempted false flag along with Gabe Hoffman for protecting Steven Spielberg. Ted Turner. Fredrick Brennan for deplatforming 8chan, a site that was providing informants in this case. Richard Bretzing.
          </p>
          <p>
           -Cause of Death: Sepsis infection and intestinal stenosis of the ileum (last 1/3 of small intestine) due to repeated anal rape related injuries and infections. The main incident responsible was the injury to her small intestines as a result of the Rocky Road incident.

            I remember reading the first couple of blinds that CDAN did about Judith.  I couldn't read any more.  I think people other than the perpetrators know about this, but why doesn't anyone speak?  These things are usually open secrets in Hollywood. Why has not ONE person in Hollywood done an anonymous post somewhere, anywhere.  Why is everyone in Hollywood protecting these child murderers?  Is there not one good soul there?

            Wow! I never knew that we had any threads about Subud. I’m good friends (going all the way back to high school) with a guy who’s dad was a founding member of one of the most famous 60’s bands to emerge from Laurel Canyon. Both his parents were involved with Subud @ one point. Needless to say, the guy has major Dissociative Identity Disorder. I’ve pieced together a few things about his childhood and it involved sexual abuse. His personality switches are so often that he’s rarely his core personality.

            - Was there proof that her casket was raided after she was entombed?

             Back in Part 5 I mentioned that this was deduction on my part.

             If she was buried in a conventional grave, it would have been a red flag that the skinning story was BS.
            </p>
            <p>
             The fact that she was interred in an above ground mausolieum makes the claim viable...and means a howdunnit and be inferred.
