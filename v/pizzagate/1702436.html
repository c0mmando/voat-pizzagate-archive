tracks.  There's a new motel there, too.)  "Be wary of quarantines on the Fed-controlled Front Range, based on faulty data; outright lies, actually."
Juge Long said that there's a former militry intel guy who speaks about how world events are known about well in advance because "[the] events re faricated and further ochestrated for the taking of resources and the manipulation of mass opinion for unspoken permission to bypass the US Constitution and other specific statues."  He said to internet-search for John Moore (
            <a href="http://thelibertyman.com">
             http://thelibertyman.com)
            </a>
            )
Bill said there was a recent (2009) obscured news report that, "The mother-in-law of the new President was just caught doing African voodoo in the White house.  This gal would be a perfect fit for Denver."  He said it was called, "'Sinatra' or 'Santeri' or something like that."  He smirked and shook his head.  "It's remarkably clever that Nairobi is a sister city of Denver."  "I'm told that the feds have full plans to expose Obama as an African, on their chosen timing.  It's been a setup from the start.  Why?--well, they wouldn't give me that detail.  When I commented that there seems to be a grand treason underfoot they replied, 'Americans will feel as if they don't have a country.'"
He said that "a sizable portion" of his information comes from a former CIA agent who is employed at McGuckin's Hardware Store.  Bill said there are a handful of former federal agents employed there (3 in the woodstove corner)" and a few dozen more of them in the area.  This local collection of semi-retired federal agents have something to do with all of the federal science stations, here and up and down the (Colorado) Front Range, with the Department of Standards being "[the] recipient of this assemblage of agents," and that, "I'd bet that intel is behind all this."  He didn't know what the major reason for this is, other than that the Dept of Standards would know the major scheme of it all.  He added, "This has been going on since before 9/11," and, "I suppose they're laying the groundwork for the federal government to move here."
"After that last building addition by Standards, there's now underground housing for some 6,500 people.  I'd like to know what that's all about.  And where does money for all that come from?"  He quipped that the Boulder Police take marching orders from the local feds, even more than they take advice from the DA's office.
Bill said that the local IBM plant and the North Boulder antenna mesa "have some very deep and dark federal connections," and that those installations are "at least a part of the reason for the generous collection of active and former federal agents here."  "The [local] IBM push for early retirements in 1989 or so was designed to make more room for NSA personnel."  He mentioned the NSA as the actual operators of the antenna mesa north of Boulder and that they control the NCAR outpost just east of marshall (just south of Boulder) that has a big antenna fence across the road form it.  The antenna fence was built during "a phony claim as a Super fund site."  He said, "Vile electronics," then refused to speak of any more details.
I'm confident that our former coffee meetings would love the current saga of the NSA whistle blower leaks and that Judge Long would lead the banter.  He said, "The NSA gets better than $295 billion a year, with that master number split up and hidden in other programs and budgets."  Bill said that it "has been known since 1979 that if you don't want anything repeated to you, don't say it over the phone," which could suggest that the recent NSA phone/data scandal is old tech and that the current exposé could be a distraction/diversion away from something much bigger or is merely a meme to suggest that you are hopelessly conquered.  "The NRO gets $108 billion a year.  That's on their website."
I've been inspired to put together my notes of retired judge William H. Long's words for a peculiar reason.  Some months ago, I gave a spare phone of mine to someone in need of a one.  He told me that five times, when he used the phone in the first few days of having it, that the Boulder police have instantly shown up around him just after he used the phone.  Two of those times were when he had just called me.  I believe that the local authorities have identified me as one of those who had heard the late-life articulations of a frustrated, honest judge.
In the past few years, since Judge Long has passed, on occasion my phone has drained, as if I had been using it.  I asked around about this.  One person got back to me, saying he had asked someone "who would know about it."  That person said that my phone "was being hacked," I was "being listened to," and/or "nasty frequencies were being broadcast to you(me)."  It may happen a few times per month or sometimes not for a month or more.

armed guards, and you get a cavity search."  This expanding security state we're experiencing is a convenient cover for the growing exposure of satanism that's used by most every authority and power structure that you can think of."
"Courts and 'officialdom' make poor light of real psychics because good psychics have the ability to more readily detect satanism and can see how deeply entrenched it is in 'officialdom,' in our country."   "I'm told that psychics are always a target of satanic groups; [that] makes sense."   He said that the larger prosecutor offices are "just apprentice-type training grounds for satanism; for future judges."  He considered all that to be 'vile voodoo," 'beyond belief," and 'treason against all human beings."
Bill said that his "contacts on this specific issue" showed a lot of patience in explaining all this until he understood it.  He was told that quantum science scratches the surface of this but that it doesn't really get it.  It is "will and intention with dark arts that manipulates world issues and local issues,...with the specific placement of satanists in authority positions who know specific satanic details," details that quantum scientists "seem to be distracted from."  This is why "psychics are always a big target," because they have  "the best potential to see through the satanism, better than the distracted quantum people."
I told Bill that I knew of a 2006 incident in Boulder in which Boulder detectives (not uniformed police), apprehended a Native American Medicine Woman (Pat Masters) who was visiting from South Dakota.  She was taken to a police station, where all her clothes were taken and she sat, naked and alone, in a room for two hours.  Then two uniformed policemen, without their badges and name tags, entered the room and tortured her with hand-held eletric stun guns.  All threatened charges against her were never filed.  her pet dog nearly died of dehydration while interred at the Boulder Humane Society.
Bill hung his head, drank his coffee and refused eye contact for awhile.  He said that he had heard of that incident (with the recent revelations of the illegal intrusiveness of the NSA and cell phone tracking capability, I'd bet her movements were monitored, even locally.  Stingray suitcase-sized cell tracker?).
We spoke of 9/11/01.  Bill said that we were spending a couple of trillion dollars on something that couldn't be proven in a court of law and would "certainly be disproven if legally challenged."  He was well aware of the push to build the UNOCAL pipeline across Afghanistan to get Caspian Sea oil and natural gas marketed to China and India. When I called the event the 'Grand Bamboozle," he said that it was 'the best polite term" that he has heard about the event.
Bill had met with a woman from India who has an uncle back in the old country "who is receiving 'political perks'" for a new oil pipeline running across his land  This branches off of the new pipeline that comes through Pakistan and Afghanistan from the Caspian Sea area.  The grandson of one coffee clatcher knows an Indian college student whose father is a new hire at a refinery, per the new pipeline to an Indian refinery--a big one.
Judge Bill knew of the increase in Afghan heroin production and estimated that it has "probably multiplied at least six-fold" since the start of the Pentagon's occupation.  He said that it appears that we have lost our country and that "the Afghanistan occupation is Vietnam all over again, but worse" and that "it will likely last indefinitely in some form or another."  Bill claimed, "The Pentagon's Afghan heroin program is still not as grand as the CIA's decades-long South America cocaine operations."  He had met an Army Special Forces veteran who had been assigned to a 'special unit at Fort Benning, Georgia."  The unit assigns detachments for six month deployments to South America, where their mission is to search and destroy any small cartels that compete with the large cartel (CIA).  "This isn't the first empire to prosper from illicit drugs."  "'Take their money and keep them stupid.'"
Judge Long said hat it could be "a safe be that the only (US) GIs getting killed in Afghanisgan are the unlucky ones who get assigned to protect the oil and gas pipelines or the heroin operations," saying that, "If they can lie about the World Trade Center, then they can lie about a few murders overseas."  Bill noted that the Pentagon bought all the press rights out of Afghanistan--before the bombing started on October 7.
Bill claimed that he sensed in advance that Hilary would get the State Department in 2008.  "It's State, DoD and the CIA who bring drugs into this country.  Hilary has been an international drug dealer since she was a governor's wife; big satanist, too."
Bill said hat the Grand Bamboozle is "sadly defining life in America"--commenting on how much power over civilization is held by "the international pirates of natural resources."  He said, "Civilization is quickly digressing, with America at the forefront of the digression."
One coffee clatch attendee asked Bill if psychic dark arts wer used in teh 9/11 Grand Bamboozle and the official sory of it all.  Juddge Lon eplied, "What do YOU thnk?  It's probably off the charts.  Real evidnce has been hidden or destroyed and witnesses have been silenced form day one."
With that statement, I told Bill and five others that I was on the website of US Senator Paul Wellsone on the Friday afternoon of the day that his small plane went down.  I clicked "itinerary" on his site and found that on the following Tuesday, at 9:30AM, the senator was going to open is own investigation of ENRON.  ENRON had a major interest in a gas-fired electricity generation plant in Pakistan, on the path of the pipelne.  It was later bought by Bechtel and GE, who were the building contractors on the project. 
A number of times we spoke of "contrived shootings, "like the ones which have recently made the front page of the news."  Bill reminded us that in 1976 an NSA official testified to a Congressional committee that they (the NSA) "have shooters on the shelf," referring to "subjects" who were psychically programmed with multiple personalities which can be revived by the programmers at any time, Manchurian-candidate style.  He wished he had kept a copy of that testimony,which a "judicial friend" had shared with him, because "it may be harder to dig up, now"--(Church hearings?).
After he first spoke of this, he later said that official papers have just been released that further admit to federal psychically-trained assassins.  He said to notice how all of the shooters end up dead at the scene or are at least kept from "local investigative scrutiny."
Twice I heard Judge Bill say that he hopes to live long enough to see the UN/NSA-planned phony UFO landing at "Denver Interplanetary Airport."  He said, "For such an event, the mind-numbing technology and psycho-sataism will outdo even the 9/11 nonsense."  "I'm told that somehow the Pope will be involved in this fiasco."  He often said that he'd "like to go out laughing."  Bill said that once he was told that a clone would be involved in this but he wasn't given much of the details on that.
Bill said that this is planned for after the federal government moves to Denver and the Colorado Front Range, which he DOES NOT want to be around for.  He said, "it'll be under "emergency conditions and dirty as hell.  Watch for Obama to already be out West when it happens; California, I'm told."
His contact told him that "what's on the table right now" as the reason for the move to Denver is "...a few planned earthquakes in the Eastern US, maybe with a category gazillion hurricane." "Our air force does weather control but I'm told that Russia is the best on the storm stuff and that they're for hire."  "The whole affair will be one very well orchestrated grab for martial law." He said it is a push to get all of the world's militaries under the control of the UN; single world currency, also.  "I'll be praying for the lot of you from my grave.  Good luck."
Bill claimed that when this happens, agents from a couple of intel agencies will move into the buildings north of the Boulder Police Station, which now house a small biotech firm.  He said that the empty business park just east of Longmont Humane Society has "long been saved for a gaggle of federal agencies."
(The governor has never moved into the governor's mansion.  An eight-apartment/condo complex is now being build within walking distance of the Boulder Police Station; this big one right next to the railroad

            judges) were in on satanic activities with that doctor but that they weren't personally involved in the Kettrick fiasco.  But the satanic prosecutors did serve to protect their satanic comrade by railroading Timothy Masters on extremely thin evidence, like using "a sort of satanic-attack mind control on the jury, which is pretty much the standard for any prosecution."
Bill claimed that "it's nearly impossible to oust a satanist judge because elections can be easily rigged; bought out.  And besides, another satanist would just be appointed to any new opening."  "The committees that recommend judges are satanists.  All judges have been to that Papoose place for testing."  New judges are selected by the quickness of the satanic skills that they demonstrate at the club."
He mentioned that the Boulder Police have their own room for satanic rituals, "of course, paid for with city funds."  He said he wasn't perfectly sure about the details but he does think a tunnel was dug to get to the room.  He thinks it may go north from the basement of the police station to the next building, occupied by a biotech firm.  Bill said to look for an additional entry to the middle of the tunnel in the garages that are north of the police station.  Bill knew that the Boulder Police pay for a sort of subscription membership with a European satanist group and use high tech electronic video gear in their ritual room to interact, live, with those European satanists.
More about satanism: I told Judge Long that in 1999 I was illegally fired from a municipal job in *****.  He immediately said, "That's a dirty little city!"  I had hard evidence of perjury against my false accusers, along with the merits of the case in my favor, but Hunter's D.A office refused to prosecute.  Bill listened intently as I told him that two private attorneys refused the case: one being the local ACLU representative (Benjamin), who I actually hadn't even asked to take the case and another attorney (Benezra), who suspiciously refused the case four days after he said he liked it--this type of case being his advertised specialty.
Bill nodded in agreement to my suggestion that both attorneys were given bribes to not take such an easy case against an entity with lots of hidden money.  He said, "About five grand would be the norm for that sort of payoff bribe, plus they won't get psycho-satanically attacked as they would if they took the case."  Bill said, "Hunter and company easily got  fifteen grand."  "Your unemployment judge probably got five (grand) and the same for each EEOC judge."  "That state senator gal (who snitched my testimony [to her] back to ******) got five."  "Appeals is where the real money is; at least ten a pop and up past forty."  "How do you think Monsanto wins all those ridiculous lawsuits?"
I told Bill details that suggested that I was attached with satanic activity over the matter. Per my details, he confirmed that I was psychically-satanically attacked. I told him that the new head of Public Works, who illegally fired me, was just in from California. With that, he said, "Sacramento has one of the most notorious stables of mercenary satanic psychics in the West.  I hear that former KGB psychics like the climate, there.  I wonder what their fees are; probably somewhat reasonable."  "It would be hard for you to compete with forty grand or so (in bribes) working against you behind the scenes; plus what they paid the satanic psychics."
Bill advised, "Don't bother to go after them any more. Just figure that what goes around comes around and that they'll get their just desserts without you lifting a finger."  "Your ball game is long over.  The umpires wear the same uniforms as the home team."  He claimed that "other top dark cities" are Boston, Chicago, Miami and L.A.  "They're everywhere and they're thick in Denver and Colorado Springs, too."
The retired judge said that  he'd never talked to someone who was conscious about being a victim of satanic-psychic attack (my awareness of that came later).  For that, he said he would buy me my next cup of specialty coffee."  I told him that I would like a mocha latté right now.  He handed me a five;  I returned some change to him and enjoyed the drink.
Judge Long said that whistleblowers are "always made out to be kooks and nuts," and "all that is directly from satanic-psychic attack on the whistleblower and his potential supporters and, to some extent, on the public.  "How they get away with it all is, for the most part, to call the other guy, 'nuts,' and use the satan attacks to make them afraid to stand up for themselves and to make mistakes; look foolish."  "Whistleblowers are always hit hard with smear campaigns that always seem to get into the press, over and above any truth in the matter."  "News media honchos get their hush-payola, too, when they're needed."
"Actually, it's a form of tampering with the jury pool."  "The defense is limited as to what they can say to the press but the prosecution has free rein to front-load a jury pool."  "They choose juries with their satanism, picking the easily influenced people."
Bill said that mercenary satanic psychics are now deeply involved in the professional and college sports worlds.  He said, "Just look at the dynasty teams for the first clue."  "Any more, many teams have their own staff of attack psychics:"  "Duke, North Carolina, Kansas, Florida, UCLA, Arizona, Connecticut; the usual suspects."  He said, "Notice that 'The Patriots' started winning after 9/11," suggesting that there was "federal assistance" with some sports satanic psychics (I've noticed that NE Patriots Coach Belichek is good friends with Coach Donovan of U of Florida basketball, recently winning two NCAA championships).
Some star pro athletes will hire their own to attack their personal opponents.  Judge Bill was convinced that Roger Clemens used "satanic psychics to attack the batters that he faced," as Clemens is always "a foul-mouthed creep," "never a gentleman," and "not able to hide his involvement with that crap."  "Tim Duncan, Kobe Bryant…" "[Sports psychics were] pretty much proved to me when the Red Sox strangely controlled the Rockies in the 2007 World Series."  (Note: on 3/20/14 Colorado men's basketball was embarrassed in their NCAA tournament game. Post game, one CU player commented, "We came out there [at the start] unfocused."  This is exactly what Judge Bill described is a typical result of sports satanic psychic attack.
Bill speculated that the expansion of dirty psychic activity, especially in sports over the past decade or more, may be due to the Russian KGB-trained psychics now being allowed to leave Russia.  One coffee clutch attendee reminded us that Kruschev said that America will collapse from the inside.  We threw this around the table for speculation and eventually concurred that any influx of KGB-trained psychics is probably not a focused political attack but just the quest for higher income by the individual former-KGB psychic agents.  We agreed on the opinion that if any country were to attack us with mass psychic attic activity, that would be China.  [Carol and I have encountered plenty of Russian and Chinese agents in our orgonite field work over the years but her sense was that they were all clearly working for and/or with the NSA, CIA and FBI.  ~Don]
Judge Long confessed that he was allowed to be a municipal judge because it "was understood" that he may be called upon to throw a case now and again.  Bill said he was speaking to us about all of this because now, to be appointed as a county or district judge, one "has to have proficiency with satanic dark arts."  He said that he turned down an offer to be a county judge because he turned down "the requirement to get involved with satanism."
Satanic judges know you're off balance and out of sync in court because of the satanism that's directed at you.  Quite often, they repeatedly interrupt you, illegally suppressing your testimony. It happens everyday, all day long, if they sense that they can get away with it, all to get more money out of you--plus the power aspect."  "They are a 'cult;' for power and money."
He added, "Those retired satanic judges and prosecutors aren't likely to hang around coffee shops and chat with the ol' boys.  They need to hide because, up close, their satanism can be felt; detected, especially if you've been a victim of their satanism."  "They can only socialize with each other."  "God-loving, honest people make them nervous and jittery.  I've seen that a number of times."
He felt that the satanism has gotten increasingly more recognizable by the public in recent years, partially shown by the advent of scans beyond mere metal detectors in court houses, saying, "The satanists get

            part 3
Bill spoke of the [Jonbenét] Ramsey [murder/pedophilia] case with a bit of trepidation.  Some of what I got on it was from the two older gentlemen that Judge Long spoke to at more length.  They told me more after the judge had passed.  It was a co-blackmail-pedophile party that was being filmed.  The girl was apparently "accustomed" to Dad and two other en but she was not used to Dad and seven other men.  Per her reluctance to participate, she was choked and hit on the head--as some sort of ritual-oriented discipline.
The participants with John Ramsey were: a Boulder deputy police chief (but not Sullenberger), a top cop from Denver, a Boulder district judge, Boulder prosecutor Robert Shapiro, a prosecutor and district judge from Larimer County, and a guy from IBM, named Stevens.  When someone said he remembered it was reported that it was investigators from the D.A.'s office who contaminated the crime scene, Judge Long said, "Of course; probably Shapiro's handiwork."
Apparently, these sorts of events get filmed, so that everyone on the films will help anyone else on the films when that one tries to make a career improvement or has some other "special project."  Judge Long called this assistance, "satanism."  He spoke of this often, een when not speaking of Ramsey.  One of the coffee-clutch attendees once said the phrase, "satanic dark arts," and he retired judge said that that sounds like a more accurate phrase.
Bill spoke of how prosecutors and judges will use psychic satanism to attack: 1) the witnesses for the defense and, 2) the defense attorney--if that attorney has not already sold out to satanism and is probably already ruining the case for the accused.
"The satanism is used to confuse you in court; make you stupid; control you."  He said that there are even a couple of public defenders who are in on this and the rest of the defenders are satanically attacked by the prosecutor's office.
He considered Shapiro to be "a sake of snakes," but he wasn't sure if Shapiro as "the top dog of that craft in that office."  He thinks that "the new D.A. is twice as evil as Shapiro," and that the new D.A., Stanley L. Garnett, declined to retain Shapiro merely because the two of them do "different flavors of satanism."  He said that Garnett's dark arts activities may be on par of those of Denver D.A. Mitch Morrissey's, who just happened to be one of the "invited investigators on the Ramsey case, likely because of his advanced satanic skills."
Judge Bill said that their use of satanism is the only real way that they can hide their clandestine payola operations, with "untaxed payola and suppression of evidence at the top of the list of their ongoing crimes."  "It would be accurate to think of them as a cult.  That's what they are, in the worst way.  Power and money…"  "Satanism is used to overpower any criminal defense."
Bill was adamant about "official incompetence" being the 'number one toolin an official coverup," mentioning Vietnam and 'the soon-to-be-eternal fiasco in Afhanistan," both hiding involvement in heroin and oil pipelines; and of course in the "Ramsey case: hiding pedophilia and satanism."
When initially speaking of the Ramsey case, the judge reminded us that a few years later, a woman offered testimony to Hunter about the case. She explained to Hunter that there exists nationwide, satanic, pedophile activity which she investigates. She spoke of how choking and hitting on the top of the head of the victim is used for discipline and training,which are the exact marks that the Ramsey girl had on her.  Hunter stated in the Boulder Daily Camera, "If only 15% of what she said is true, then it is worth investigating."  Hunter announced his retirement within two weeks after speaking with that woman.
Bill told us to drive by the Ramsey house to look at its design and the iron fence around the lot. He called it, "your basic Bavarian-satanic architecture."  [Carol and I drove a key satanist (a pediatrician) in Moscow, Idaho, from a mansion like that one by putting orgonite around the property in 2003.  ~Don]
Judge Bill said that prosecutors and judges use pendulums and rituals to summon demons and arch demons to do their bidding for them.  Some of this was shown to him while being offered to teach him the dark craft.  He said that it is the "satanism that you feel as soon as you walk into a courteous; any courthouse."  That (satanism) has something to do with all the marble in court houses.  Somehow it (the satanism) gets injected into the marble with ritual or dirty prayers."  "I remember something about the old Enron headquarters being filled with pink marble."  "JeffCo (Jefferson County courthouse--lots of marble) feels like a cesspool, even more than the one in Boulder."
Bill spoke of the Boulder Police satanists getting dogs from the Boulder Humane Society in the middle of the night, and of the prosecutors and judges sharing in their ritual blood drinking, "in addition to the prosecutors' and judges' own ritual meetings."  Other animals (but mostly dogs) are received from a small variety of other sources.  Bill spoke of an indoor kennel where the dogs are kept--prior to their demise--not very far up Lee Hill Road, within walking distance of Shapro's home which is at the end of Valley Lane, where many dark arts activities take place.  Bill said that Shapiro is also active with satanism in Summit County.
He was told that most often, before a 'satan event," the participants will have a dinner party either at the Red Lion or at the Greenbriar, occasionally dining there after their satanic event.  With directional hand gestures he said, "The dirty Boulder deputies are assigned to the foothills where the satanists play and the clean ones get assigned to the flats."  Bill added, "At least a baker's dozen of them (satanists) live in the Lake of the Pines (gated community between Boulder and Lyons). 
Bill told us that he'd heard multiple stories about "the Papoose Cub on Highway 67, up from Deckers in Western Douglas County," and that it is "the main evil party spot and education center for Colorado satanists."  There are "select Douglas County deputies who patrol those local roads…all of them [the select deputies] are on duty for weekends and satan events."  "They have a high tech comm link for broadcasting and receiving with other satan events elsewhere.  You can see their microwave communication broadcasting and receiving drum from the road in front of the locked gate."  "They've been known to extend their satan parties to the Franktown Cave" and "sometimes in closed mines."
"When they visit 'the club,' they load up the motels in Woodland Park and Manitou Springs; motels probably owned by satanists."  Judge Bill seemed excited and pleased to be telling us of "the club."  He once brought a list of favorite motels for the "club attendees:"  "Pikes Peak Lodge, Crown Point, and the Intercontinental."  Bill mentioned that Woodland Park is "the closest town to overlook the Air Force Rape Academy."
"Many of the leaders and instructors [at the Papoose Club] are civilians who work at Ft. Carson; some of them even live on the post [This clearly shows the CIA connection, I believe.  The proximity of the Air Force Academy also shows strong CIA connection.  ~Don].  "My contacts have never seen military uniforms at the club but they say that they know that some are military."  "…Federal Intel hotshots," "some thick foreign accents."
"[The Papoose Club]…brings in four million dollars a year, most of it tax free, because it comes from those tax-less hidden funds of cities and counties."  Someone at the Trident once grilled Bill for details of the dark events at the Papoose Club and at Shapiro's.  Bill stared at him for a moment, then he left for the day.
Judge Long said that satanists have finally, completely taken over the Colorado State Police and that ''for the past ten years or more" they have only hired other satanists.  He suggested, "This could also be true in many, many states; just as the use of that density meter and other illegal tech toys."   Also, "It's a mystery as to where they're finding the massively-oversized recruits for their new hires."
He found out about the Larimer County, Kettrick v. Timothy Masters case.  He said, "Of course it was satanism related."  He said that the guilty party was the doctor who died (was murdered) before the fixed trial started, noting the doctor-like precision of how Kettrick was cut up.  The two prosecutors (later both

He said that Police Chief Beckner is "kept in place because, for the most part, he's a chump and that it is always two deputy chiefs who run the dirty operations, along with the detectives running the drugs."  "Boulder Police takes counsel from the D.A., who is complicit with the drug running and gets his cut."
Per our lengthy exchanges on this matter, the various groups at the café(s) were convinced of the reality of this long-running untaxed clandestine payola conspiracy, of Boulder police detectives' drug dealing and of Hunter's absolute corruption.  Hunter won't find any friends at the Trident or in Lyons.
I told Bill that I've read about extra hidden money that cities, counties and states have and he confirmed that this is "the main part of the package."  In fact, it is cities, and sometimes counties, that hold these clandestine mortgages to conceal the untaxed transfer of funds from the eyes of the normal banking system.
This fits well, as it is hidden investment profit money from cities, states, etc., that pay to the hidden mortgages that are titled to secretive trust accounts of "the thieving public officials."  "It's only natural that cities are the ones to hold those (hidden) mortgages."
He said that this setup is so pervasive, nationwide, that it is "a well-oiled and well-connected conspiracy system that communicates very well between its members."  It is fully self-sustaining because every member of the system is self-sufficient, per every member's heavy investment in the stock market.  If there are any weak links in the system, the bulk of the rest of the system can easily assist with the temporary shortfall of a member's "local payola responsibility."
"It's the nameless, forgotten city auditors who keep the second set of books."  He said, "Goldman Sachs does the lion's share of investing for these institutional investors so of course they get the lion's share of any available inside political tips."
We spoke of how a 2008 presidential candidate quipped, "I don't know how many houses I have."  It came out the next day that he has nine.  Two days later, it came out that he has 14. All of us joked and speculated about how much monthly clandestine, tax-free payola a long-entrenched U.S. Senator receives.
Members of the hidden conspiracy of this untaxed profit scheme are cities, counties, states, municipal and state retirement funds, etc.  This is the background for the phrase, "You can't beat City Hall" (in the courts), because "judges and prosecutors are the main recipients" of the untaxed distribution of clandestine payments--from the city halls.  He said, "This aspect of the scheme is not to be underestimated."  "Every recipient of these hidden goods is a criminal, and a whore to that well-conspired system.  There's probably not enough prison cells for the lot of them."  "I've never seen a dime of this.  I'm told that only a handful of municipal judges in Colorado are in on it; a couple in Colorado Springs and Denver are."
Judge Bill claimed, "As long as the real thieves hold the keys to the cops, the courts and the legislatures America will be a parasitic cesspool."  "It's the best protected and probably the largest crime syndicate in the history of North America."
The judge said that he found that this tax-free hidden public money system owns at least half of the stock market and, "Yes, of course, the IRS is in on the fix; fully complicit and involved."  Bill sarcastically said, "Heaven forbid that a whistleblower should expose this scam scheme, and Heaven help him, too!"
Judge Long said that no city or state is bankrupt--that they just lie about what they really have so that dirty insiders can line their pockets with the unreported profits from hidden investments.  He added that there are a couple of banks and mortgage firms that are in on theft and will hide some of the "clandestine mortgages."
