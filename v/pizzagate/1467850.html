<pre><code>Robert Eric McFadden, who also helped co-found the group Catholics in Alliance for the Common Good, was arrested Wednesday in suburban Dublin, Ohio. He has been charged with seven felonies, including pandering obscenities involving a minor, promoting prostitution and compelling prostitution, according to a Columbus Police Department spokesman. Police spokesman Sgt. Richard Weiner confirmed that the 46-year-old McFadden is the same person who worked for Strickland.
</code></pre>

<p>McFadden used complex encoded postings on Craigslist that would look like useless or corrupted data, in which he would embed the information of the woman available, the type of sex interaction she would be willing to perform and the place to meet her. Paradoxically, McFadden\'s code name in his transactions was &quot;mcfaddencatholic.&quot;</p>
<p>Eric McFadden, 46, the former head of the Office of Faith-Based Initiatives for Governor of Ohio, Ted Strickland, was arrested this morning and faces two counts of promoting prostitution, two counts of pandering obscenity involving a minor, two counts of pandering obscenity involving a nude minor and one count of compelling prostitution, Franklin County Prosecutor Ron O\'Brien told the Springfield News-Sun.</p>
<p>In 2006, he was a spokesperson for Catholics in Alliance for the Common Good, and more recently, he was Hillary Clinton’s lead Catholic outreach organizer as the State Faith &amp; Values Outreach Director during the race for the Democratic presidential nomination.  
</p>
<p>More at article - he considered himself a trafficking &quot;guru&quot; and wrote on how not to get caught.   Guess Clinton read your book bozo.</p>

            Just so everybody knows, "Catholics in Alliance for the Common Good" is a Soros funded group to try to take down Catholicism from the inside.

            Here's what the Catholic League says about them:
