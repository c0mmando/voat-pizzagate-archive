<p>Maybe we should dedicate a thread(or is there?) to dig into this huge lead. First there is a relatively small time window. The email was sent May 14th 2009. Obama moved into the  on January 18th 2009. If this private party took place in the white house, it must have been between those dates. We could start with looking into Obama\'s time schedule for this period. Look for big events involving the white house particularly. Since when the suspicions would be true, it probably takes multiple dozen connected connoisseurs to devour $65.000 of pizza/dogs. Prominent people coming to the white house rarely goes unnoticed, so it must have been done under the guise of something else, or it was done simultaneously with something big enough to obscure a large private get-together that has its dinner flown in from Chicago.</p>
<p>Here is a rough timeline of Obama\'s first year in office.</p>
<p><a href="http://archive.is/kV3o5">http://archive.is/kV3o5</a></p>
<p>Please scan the data yourself. I have found at least two interesting cases of activity at the white house during these first 4 months.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Lead 1</strong></p>
<p>March 31 - Barack and Michelle Obama arrive in London for G20 meeting with World Leaders.[145]</p>
<p>April 1 - Obama meets British Prime Minister Gordon Brown,[146] Russian President Dmitri Medvedev, Chinese President Hu Jintao, and Queen Elizabeth II.[147]</p>
<p>April 2 - The G-20 summit begins in London, England.[148] The President announces Robert Groves to be his candidate for director of The Census Bureau[149]</p>
<p>April 3 - Obama meets French President Nicolas Sarkozy[150] and holds a town hall meeting with French and German students.[151]</p>
<p>April 3–4 - Obama attends the two-day NATO summit in Strasbourg, France, and Kehl and Baden-Baden, Germany.[152][153]</p>
<p>April 5 - Obama meets with Czech President Václav Klaus and Prime Minister Mirek Topolánek.[154] He gives a thoughtful speech on nuclear proliferation disarmament to a public crowd in Prague. Earlier the North Korean government had launched a long-range multi-stage rocket.[155]</p>
<p>April 6–7 - Obama visits Istanbul and Ankara, Turkey, including a meeting at the Alliance of Civilizations forum.[156]</p>
<p><strong>April 9 - In a presidential first, Obama hosts a White House Seder for the second night of Passover.[159]</strong></p>
<p>So the president has toured Europe and the Middle east for over a week and the first thing he does when he comes back is throw a Seder. Why would he celebrate that? Unless he was celebrating something different?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>White House aides denied rumors that campaign donors would be invited to the dinner, saying the Seder was aimed at celebrating with staffers and close friends of the family. &quot;This is an important holiday to a lot of members of our staff, and this Seder will be meaningful for them,&quot; an aide said.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A lot of names to look into in the article to distinguish whether this is a lead</p>

<p>I want to share with you a reddit post from someone claiming to be a first hand witness to disturbing occult practices in his family. Please note although the guy seems to be the standard case of an anti-semite shill, it could too be the case that he was kept outside of the inner workings of what was going on due to him being adopted. It could be that his un-informedness about his adoptive family made him write about \'Jews\' in such fashion. In fact, his family may have been satanists abusing this person, telling him they were of the Jewish fate, and thus furthering their goal of neutralizing and discrediting witness accounts like these. </p>

<p>This is all speculation of course, but it would explain why Obama’s inner circle is preoccupied with a Jewish holiday, as what they celebrated was not Jewish but Satanic:</p>

<p>Anyway, on to the other lead</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Lead 2</strong></p>
<p>May 4 - Obama marks Cinco de Mayo a day early in a small speech to Latino Americans. Obama was joined by First Lady Michelle Obama, Vice President Joe Biden, Second Lady Jill Biden, United States Ambassador to Mexico Arturo Sarukhan and his wife Veronica Valenca-Sarukhan.[178]</p>
<p>May 5 - Obama meets with Israeli President Shimon Peres in the Oval Office of the White House to discuss the foreign affairs of Israel, the relationship between Palestinians and Israelis, and the prospects of a two-state solution.[179]</p>
<p>May 6 - President Obama holds a summit with Afghan President Hamid Karzai and Pakistani President Asif Ali Zardari at the White House.[180]</p>
<p><strong>May 9 - Obama speaks at the White House Correspondents\' Dinner, along with special guest comedian Wanda Sykes.[181]</strong></p>
<p>Apparently, it was total chaos on Capitol Hill during those days:</p>
<p><a href="http://trashwire.com/2009/05/11/the-a-list-comes-out-for-nerdprom/">http://trashwire.com/2009/05/11/the-a-list-comes-out-for-nerdprom/</a></p>
<p><a href="http://archive.is/lqrFp">http://archive.is/lqrFp</a></p>
<p>Sounds perfect to hide notorious activity. And what is up with 50% of the hotel being closed down due to renovations during such a busy day. So start digging into who has attended. Also, try to look into how the security of this busy day was organized. Could it be Stratfor had a big job in DC that night?</p>
<p>Could it be that “not long ago” mentioned in the emails was just 6 days earlier? That they were joking in code about what they witnessed? It would explain why the media is freaking out like it is, as many of their top brass might have been invited to the private get together.</p>',

            I keep thinking this email is the biggest lead.... that 65k payment should have some paper work right.. the flight will have flight logs, the flight crew should remember transporting that much 'pizza and hot dogs',,,  these are the basics we/the FBI should be focused on right?? the Sabbataen Zionist connection is the end point,, let's get the paper trail and evidence first no?

            Just an idea: The published schedule of Obama just seems to include official activities. However, the visitor log (downloadable from whitehouse.gov) could reveal other activities. For example, Alefantis visits to the White House were not related to the official schedule, but two of the times he was invited by POTUS together with several hundreds of people to some kind of unofficial receptions. So, if someone could check? (I must go to sleep now.)

            What you're describing  is the difference between actual "jews" and the Zionists, who hide behind the label "jew" even though they're not. They're using the perma-victim-protected-status (anti-semitism) as a barrier between their actions and the public's attention.

             I want to avoid referring to them as Zionists, as A Zionist is simply someone who is in favor of the State of Israel.
            </p>
            <p>
             A lot of innocent people probably call themselves Zionists.

            <p>
             That´s why I try to refer to these murderers pretending to be of the Jewish people as Satanists.

              That's literally the point of their using the term Zionist. It's a smokescreen. Zionists may be jewish, but to be a Zionist does not make you a jew. Abrahamic, maybe, but ultimately no matter which tradition you look at, they all have the same bad guy, regardless of who they claim their good guy is.
             </p>
             <p>
              It's kind of like the freemasons who are Luciferian (not satanic). They don't care which god you believe in as long as you believe in the ultimate evil. Then you're either on a white square or a black square, referring to the kind of magic you're working with. If anything they should all be gray magicians but... extremes, etc etc.
