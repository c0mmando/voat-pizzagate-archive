<p>I figured it would be just a staged greeting,” said his father, Joel Rich. “But my wife and I were both really caught off guard. Secretary Clinton had talked with people who knew Seth — and it wasn’t just that he had worked at the DNC and was a nice guy.” </p>

<p>“We found out that the secretary had requested that we be the last ones so she could spend more time with us.”</p>
<p>If Seth was just some low level DNC staffer, then why, during a very busy and stressful presidential campaign she is in the middle of running, would she stop by to meet with the family of a victim of a botched robbery and go speak to people who knew him? Running an even more expensive campaign than Obama, does anyone really think she had time to learn&quot;a lot about Seth&quot; and speak not only with his family, but others who knew him? I don\'t buy that. If Hillary wanted to look human, she would have had the Clinton News Network (CNN) do a huge story on how she is so compassionate and caring that she took the time to visit and grief with the family of a slain worker. Then all the other media giants would have spread the story to humanize her. Instead, it was a private meeting and no news network other than the Omaha World Herald, the local town news org, reported on it. Now if this theory is true, that Seth was the DNC leaker...then it makes it all much more creepier that Hillary personally asked to meet with them in private and that she was snooping around to see what those who knew him knew.</p>
<p>&quot;The Riches plan to meet this morning with detectives and the Washington police chief. Joel said he “absolutely” believes that it was a random crime.&quot;</p>
<p>This article was written on Wednesday August 03, 2016 and the meeting between the Rich family and Clinton Happened on August 01, 2016. Isn\'t it odd that Hillary asked to meet privately with the family just two days before they are meeting with detectives and the Washington police chief?</p>
<p>Hey, maybe Clinton has a big heart and is more compassionate than we all know and maybe Seth Rich was indeed a victim of a robbery where his $2,000 in cash, credit cards, rolex, and pendant were left behind but the shell casings were located and discarded before police showed up minutes later....but...I think common sense would tell us otherwise. </p>
<p>Seth deserves justice and looks like we, the people, are the only ones capable of finding it for him, so lets keep digging guys!</p>
<p><strong>Update:</strong></p>
<p>I checked google to see the earliest article that was mentioned about Hillarys plans for her Omaha visit. The earliest I could find was July 29, 2016. 19 days after Seth Rich death and less than a week before the family was scheduled to meet with detectives and the DC Police Chief. Very odd that of all places for Hillary to set up a random campaign stop, she decides in little old Omaha, Nebraska, a red state, and ask to meet with the Rich family in private, but have no media coverage of it. Now I don\'t know the familys address, but I know that they attend the Beth El Synagogue in Omaha, which is less than ten miles from the highschool Clinton made an extra stop at. Very interesting.</p>',

            That's all very interesting. Is it known when the trip was planned? Not that that proves anything one way or another. She went out of her way to meet with them and the media oddly didn't cover it much.

           <blockquote>
            <p>
             The Rich family learned last Friday afternoon from the Clinton campaign in Omaha that the presidential candidate wanted to meet them. Monday morning, the couple were told that photos would be taken.
            </p>
            <p>
             When they got to North High for the photo session, Joel said, “We found out that the secretary had requested that we be the last ones so she could spend more time with us.” They showed Clinton a photo of Seth and his girlfriend outside the White House. Mary Rich said Clinton remarked on what a room-brightening smile he had.
            </p>
            <p>
             Joel asked if the candidate would sign a photo for the girlfriend, whom he identified only as Kelsey from the Detroit area. Tuesday morning, he received the autographed photo, which included an expression of sympathy from Clinton.
            </p>
           </blockquote>
           <p>
            To me, it's just a whole new low for Clinton to sign a picture of Seth for his girlfriend. Oh, and of course Hillary had to have pictures taken! She had to look good for the public.
           </p>
           <p>
            Hillary thinks Seth had a smile that lit up the room. She seemed to know a lot about him? Oh please 🙄 These hurting parents are clearly being manipulated by these sick evil people who are giving them sympathy during a time of grief and weakness.

            Reeking of brimstone, Clinton flew to Omaha today to grill the Rich family on their involvement or knowledge of DNC information passing to Wikileaks.  While meeting with the family Clinton offered whatever they needed as payolla to keep quite about the shooting.  Clinton also recommended her psychotherapist and offered free sessions to the family....

            Yep, very good summation. Really those are the most logical conclusions to draw as well. It's all falling into place right in front of our eyes. If the circumstances weren't so foul I'd say these are amazing times we're living in, instead I'll say these are unbelievably sick times.

             AreWeSure there is no record of Seth Rich being killed, no police body cameras, no camera footage at all besides some grainy barely visible clip from a convenience store, no autopsy released all of which according to Rod Wheeler "never happens".
            </p>
            <p>
             Seth Rich's brother is on the verge of laughter the entire interview his parents do with the media after Seth's murder. Do you have siblings AreWeSure? If one of them died would you be on the verge of laughter?

             The only other time I've seen something so fucked up is when one of the Sandy Hook "parents" laughed and smiled all the way up to the podium where he talks about his daughter being shot multiple times with an assault rifle.

            the thing about psychopaths is that they can be the most charming individuals on earth who do go out of their way to learn a lot about you so they can make you feel warm and fuzzy. the thing is ..... darkmath is right ..... at the end of the day .... they're all cunts who will fuck you up and then smile and tell people you're fucking crazy and not to listen to you .... and people believe them. and on another note. secretary clinton ? last time i checked hillary lost the election and doesnt work for the government anymore. why does she still have a security clearance and why is she still even relevant ? she should be on her rocking chair watching the police dig up bodies in her front yard

              yeah its not right. if you leave a job you should no longer have access to their inner workings. thats a bullshit rule politicians made up to serve themselves. like the bullshit rule they made up about sealing documents. thats what a guilty person would do. make records unavailable for a hundred years. how do they even get away with this shit.

                Not personal worth (herself and Bill have an estimated net worth of about $100 million) but their foundation has raised over $2 billion, only a small fraction of which goes towards direct aid, and they certainly benefit from this in terms of free flights etc. Not to mention the odd $1 million dollar birthday cheque from terrorist-sponsoring nations (eh Bill?)

            Thank you. An extremely important piece to the puzzle. The sheer weight of their meeting was meant to seduce their psychological trauma into the Dems hands. The nice lady I'm sure offered them any help she could, while making sure to tell them that the investigation was going to be in the hands of DC's best. Trust her. A warm handshake, a hug.

            I have said this b4 and its my own opinion, but I do not trust much of what the parents of Seth Rich say. Too much weird, and beyond unbelievable interviews ect. They have directly or indirectly been comprised!

             I think you could say both, that it was a random crime and help us find the killer. These aren't necessarily inconsistent. What is not consistent is that if they did want help, you'd think that they would publicly release the death cert and medical info/ballistics etc that they could provide. I would guess that Metro police must have given some crazy reason to keep this hushed that the Rich family has bought into. I wish the cousin that tweeted would release this stuff.

             I had checked to see earlier reports on what Joel Rich had mentioned about the robbery, cuz I remember seeing something that gave me the impression he didn't really by the botched robbery theory. But the articles that came out right after his death and before the clinton article, all mentioned he believed it was a robbery. Was hoping to find he changed his tune after the clinton meeting, but no dice.

             When you add in the fact she scheduled the meeting a couple weeks after Seth was murdered and 2 days before the family was to meet with detectives and police chief, and the fact of all places she adds an extra stop to, is Omaha NE only a few miles away from where the family lives, and the fact she was out talking to people who knew him, during a busy campaign for PRESIDENT...you think it's not even worth mentioning and think i'm making a BFD for writing a post about it?
