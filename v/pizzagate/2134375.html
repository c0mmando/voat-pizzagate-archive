<p>&quot;The JonBenet&quot; never indicated, as far as I can find, that they had named themselves after JonBenet Ramsey, but it has been widely assumed that they did.  Noise/scream punk bands often give themselves weird names, but this seems like a particularly odd choice.  Clearly they would have been aware that they were tying themselves in the public mind to a 6-year-old child who had suffered strangulation (possibly ritual), rape, and brutal murder.

<p>Do these people know something we don’t about what happened to JonBenet?  Were they portraying themselves as being like her--victims of someone or something, perhaps a some malevolent system or organization?  Or were they just making a social statement seven years after her death?  The band was active from 2003 to 2009 in Houston.</p>

<p>Arched back and a couple of slit wrists</p>
<p>How often can you tell me that I can\'t love you</p>
<p>Just maybe I can</p>
<p>Just maybe I can</p>
<p>Somehow I\'ll break those arms</p>
<p>And someday I\'ll break those arms</p>
<p>Watching Jesus Christ</p>
<p>Emerge in the form of a firearm</p>
<p>I sit back and relax</p>
<p>I sit back and relax</p>
<p>My wife of forty years</p>
<p>I raped her</p>
<p>He began that day like any other</p>
<p>Holding hands with savory little beauties</p>
<p>Let them know that you love them</p>
<p>And tell them all you want is to be cared for</p>
<p>That\'s all you want</p>
<p>Is to be cared for</p>
<p>That\'s all you want</p>

<p>My heart is slowly sinking into a hell</p>
<p>That won\'t heal with drinking</p>
<p>Keep killing them when they start healing</p>
<p>I\'m a bastard with no heart</p>
<p>And I think I\'ve been fucked from the start</p>
<p>Please take me away from this world</p>

The cowbell is a series of parentheses, anywhere from one to three, around the name of a Jewish person, to signal Jewishness.&quot;</p>

           An article about the band:
           <a href="https://chicago.ohmyrockness.com/bands/the-jonbenet?_escaped_fragment_=">
            https://chicago.ohmyrockness.com/bands/the-jonbenet?_escaped_fragment_=
           </a>
           Note the title on the browser tab shows double parentheses like this ((The JonBenet)), which apparently is a variation on triple parentheses according to this article:
           <a href="http://www.slate.com/blogs/lexicon_valley/2016/06/02/the_jewish_cowbell_the_meaning_of_those_double_parentheses_beloved_by_trump.html">

           </a>
           It says:  "Let’s call the construction the Jewish cowbell. The cowbell is a series of parentheses, anywhere from one to three, around the name of a Jewish person, to signal Jewishness."
