<p>The NY District court is investigating a company linked to Canadian-American billionaire David Gilmour, according to court filings released a week ago. The company, Ack Wakaya Holdings LLC, is owned by Clare Bronfman, heiress to the Bronfman fortune and currently the interim leader of NXIVM. A serial entrepreneur, Gilmour is known for running Barrick Gold Corporation, as well as founding Fiji water, two leaders in their respective industries. Gilmour is no longer affiliated with either company, but runs Wakaya Perfection, a health foods/naturopathic brand under the aforementioned LLC. Ack Wakaya Holdings owns Wakaya Club and Spa, a resort whose attendees have included <strong>Tom Cruise, Nicole Kidman, Jim Carrey, Bill Gates and more.</strong></p>

Co-founder of Barrick Gold, the largest gold-mining enterprise in the world, and the TrizecHahn global real estate empire, Gilmour established himself locally as a partner of the South Pacific Hotel Corporation, which had become the biggest hotel chain in the South Pacific when he sold it in 1979. Since then, he has founded Fiji Water, the square-bottled global hydrator, selling it in 2004, when it was the second-most-popular imported bottled water in the United States. In the forty years since he first set foot in Fiji, Gilmour has given back to the islands through extensive philanthropic programs, sinking $75 million of his own fortune into Wakaya and $300 million into the islands overall, making him the single biggest private investor in the country\'s history.”</p>

Prior to her death she spoke of having her body frozen until Raniere discovered a way to bring her back to life.</p>

<p>Gilmour bought the island in 1970 for around $1million. A philanthropist with a fortune from ventures including hotel chains, gold mining and the Fiji Water brand, he pays for the education of Wakaya villagers and for blind children in the Bahamas and serves on other world charitable foundations.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>His Club guests have included <strong>Bill Gates, Spain’s Crown Prince, Celine Dion, Tom Cruise and the Rolling Stones’ Keith Richards</strong> (reportedly injured in a fall from a Wakaya coconut tree!) They include many anonymous international visitors who travel for up to 24 hours to seek out the style and seclusion of one of Wakaya’s eight spacious thatched timber bungalows. Each has a wide deck overlooking the water, private sun garden and individual stretch of beach.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Bronfman’s and Gilmour have previously worked together with <strong>Trizec Hahn properties</strong>, one of the largest real estate companies in North America and the former owners of Houston, Texas’ Enron building. This is an astounding revelation, because it suggests the same families and corporations who pooled money into Enron property shifted to properties related to a cult. Not to mention that it shatters the illusion that the Bronfman involvement with NXIVM is somehow unrelated to the family\'s former involvement in organized crime as the titular rumrunners of the prohibition era. </p>
<p><a href="https://www.mail-archive.com/ctrl@listserv.aol.com/msg82790.html">Per this link</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Consider the fact that the men who control Barrick also controlled <strong>TrizecHahn</strong>, which owns the complex of office buildings in southwest downtown-Houston whose tenants include Halliburton and Enron.  The office  buildings were originally built by a joint venture composed of Cullen Bank and  Dresser Industries (owned by Brown Brothers Harriman).  <strong>The corporation issued debentures to improve the buildings, with the money coming from Trizec--a Canadian company that launders money for Bronfmans. It also includes Eagle Star Insurance (Rothschild) and British and Canadian banking establishment.</strong>  My guess is that this network which acquired the office  buildings, also is heavily invested in the business of the tenants of those buildings. In fact, Enron may have been a cleverly disguised scheme to launder money using derivatives.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="http://bcsecuritiescommissionasham.blogspot.com/2017/01/911-funding-bronfman-family-barrick.html">This article also linked the Bronfman\'s and Iran-Contra arms dealer Adnan Kashoggi to the Barrick board</a>, suggesting this venture is the continuation of decades of financial (criminal?) involvement:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>During the late 1980’s and early 1990’s, there would be at least two additional major investors brought into Barrick, as Khashoggi backed out. Khashoggi used his stock in Barrick as collateral to finance the arms sent to Iran by the US under President Reagan, and CIA Director George Bush. The second group – after the Saudis - would be the Bronfman family, who merged its mammoth real estate firm, Trizec, with Barrick Gold. Today, the Bronfman family of New York is a widely respected name.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/newsbysector/industry/mining/9789062/Nat-Rothschild-to-leave-board-of-Barrick-Gold.html">Up until 2013, Nat Rothschild was on the board of the Toronto-based company.</a> So was former Canadian PM and co-architect of the NAFTA deal Brian Mulroney. </p>
<p><strong>Rabbit Hole</strong></p>
<p>Ack Wakaya\'s company website seems to be run by Robert Blinken, according to a Whois lookup of the owner of the IP. Robert Blinken is interesting because the Blinken\'s are major figures in the Open Society Foundation to the point where they OWN the Open Society archives. But what\'s significant is that the New York wing of the family--or Robert Blinken Jr\'s father--was an executive member of the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2006/03/19/fashion/weddings/ingrid-blinken-and-nicholas-lamia.html">New York Blood Center.</a></p>

The second group – after the Saudis - would be the Bronfman family, who merged its mammoth real estate firm, Trizec, with Barrick Gold. Today, the Bronfman family of New York is a widely respected name.

Robert Blinken is interesting because the Blinken's are major figures in the Open Society Foundation to the point where they OWN the Open Society archives.

             There's something to this actually. Canadian businessmen acting as supra-national agents on behalf of the De Rothschilds (Edgar Bronfman), Clinton Foundation (Frank Giustra).

              Gotta give credit to the Clintons. They went from rubbing shoulders with the big wigs in a hillbilly state to schmoozing with the head honchos on the world stage.

            OP mentioned
            <strong>
             David Gilmour's involvement with Barrick Gold Corporation.
            </strong>
           </p>
           <p>
            Here is a list of their subsidiaries, below.  That's a lot of
            <strong>
             tunneling
            </strong>
            connected to a man close to now NXIVM leader Clare Bronfman.  It makes you wonder if there are other uses to Barrick Gold tunnels.

            Real sloppy mistake: GeorgeHW Bush was CIA director for one year 76-77 and was of course Reagan's VP.
           </p>
           <p>
            ALL the major financial scams since the 80s including Enron have been by Jews and I challenge you to give me a single one that wasn't.
           </p>
           <p>
            Not Naming the Jew makes your research utterly useless, as evidenced by this board whose members still don't have a clue after 18 months.  YOU SHOULD FEEL BAD.

WE will begin testing for radioactive nuclides, like tritium, polonium, and plutonium. ASAP

             Non-Nestle water.  Kirkland is good and comes from a non-corporate, family owned source.  I'm beginning to wonder if there was a tie in for Fiji water - non flouride - shipped to the elite to keep their pineal glands nice an calcium-free.  In return, they build a brand for a fellow pedo.  Circle of pedo life.

              Two years ago I would have skipped over your comment and dismissed you.  Now, after everything I have learned in my studies here and in related places, I am tipping my hat to your thesis and bookmarking your post.  Spine is tingling, because there has to be something to all of this...
