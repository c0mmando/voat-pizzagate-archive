              I just remembered Senate Anon specifically calling out the Jesters in Florida and he said to pay close attention to the worshipful masters. William Trey Rapp became a worshipful master in 2012 after having been a Shriner for just four years and became a Master Mason after one year. Could he have any connection to the other worshipful master that SenateAnon called out by name, John Stafford, who ran the Sarasota airport?

                US Senate Anon has been posting all night long and there are four, very worthwhile threads you should all read.
               </p>
               <p>
                This thread is dedicated to investigating the specific hints US Senate Anon dropped. I have compiled a few of those hints:

                I am not sure, I actually suggest doing a little background reading via some VOAT threads because Racine has been extensively talked about on the VOAT pizzagate subforum...

               <p>
                And speak of the devil. I went onto VOAT just now to see if I couldn't find something on Racine and before I even got a chance to search I see this thread about Paul Ryan taking $25,500 from convicted child molester and former speaker of the house (and long time Podesta buddy) Dennis Hastert.

                How do you guys feel about the whole foxconn thing? Seems a bit strange for a company like that to up and decide to build a 10 billion dollar facility in an area like that.

             I just remembered Senate Anon specifically calling out the Jesters in Florida and he said to pay close attention to the worshipful masters. William Trey Rapp became a worshipful master in 2012 after having been a Shriner for just four years and became a Master Mason after one year? Could he have any connection to the other worshipful master that SenateAnon called out by name, John Stafford, who ran the Sarasota airport?

               The Worshipful Master
               <strong>
                assumes the role to serve the Brethren and see to their needs. The Worshipful Master is like the Queen Bee in a beehive. The Worshipful Master is carefully selected for the role, and he is someone that has been groomed for the Chair during his tenure as Senior Warden, Junior Warden and other Masonic positions

               While "Master" is easy to understand as the person in charge, the term "Worshipful" can sound very foreign. As one source puts it: "The honorific 'Worshipful' does not suggest that the Master is worshiped, but is used in its original meaning, 'worthy of respect' (Mayors and magistrates in parts of England are also ...

               Worshipful Master.
               <strong>
                The Worshipful Master sits in the east, symbolic of the rising sun, and presides over the lodge, like a president or chairman.
               </strong>
               Even if the building faces the wrong direction, the Master is said to be "in the east." While serving his term as Master, his word is final over the actions of the lodge.

               Past Worshipful Master. In January of 1968, I was installed a Worshipful Master of a Masonic Lodge of about 600 men. As far as I was concerned, I had reached the pinnacle of life.
               <strong>
                As a Worshipful Master, I had total autocratic authority over the affairs of my Lodge with accountability only to the Grand Master of my State.

               In Craft Freemasonry, sometimes known as Blue Lodge Freemasonry, every Masonic Lodge elects or appoints Masonic Lodge Officers to execute the necessary functions of the lodge's life and work. The precise list of such offices may vary between the jurisdictions of different Grand Lodges, although certain factors are common to all, and others are usual in most.Wikipedia
