<p>&quot;Over the last decade, nearly 200,000 children have been adopted into the United States, 25,000 of whom came from Guatemala. Finding Fernanda, a dramatic true story paired with investigative reporting, tells the side-by-side tales of an American woman who adopted a two-year-old girl from Guatemala and the birth mother whose two children were stolen from her. Each woman gradually comes to realize her role in what was one of Guatemala’s most profitable black-market industries: the buying and selling of children for international adoption. Finding Fernanda is an overdue, unprecedented look at adoption corruption—and a poignant, riveting human story about the power of hope, faith, and determination.&quot; </p>

            It's not only international adoptions, it happens everyday right here in the US through CPS.  If Americans believe that the 427000 children currently in the system were all physically, sexually abused or in imminent danger they are sadly mistaken.  Children are taken from good families consistently with no substantiated claims, they are gagged by judges forbidding them to publicize their case, they aren't given due process in court and the social workers fabricate allegations.  One only needs to visit any of the 100's of FB groups and hear the plights of parents who've lost their children.  Just start out looking at one online publication that took up this cause where their focus is on the children who've not only been taken by CPS but also aided by the medical community.  www.MedicalKidnap.com
