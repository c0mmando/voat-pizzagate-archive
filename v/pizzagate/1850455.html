            , I hate to say this, but there is no connection here to trafficking by the elite, or connection to any larger network. It's just another low-level pedo -- which we are not really investigating. I think your point about desensitizing is a good one, especially because it reinforces the idea this is the behavior of the lowest rung of society, putting a great deal of distance between Smart's story and John Podesta et al. I need to remove this per Rule 1. Please repost with a link to the removed submission in

            Something has always stunk to high heaven with that case.  Like many others, I suspect that she had gotten pregnant (see photos of her very rounded face -- starved?  LOL), and her "pro-life" Mormon parents got her an abortion.  Another possibility is that she was already pregnant by someone else, and the "kidnapping" story was a ruse to cover that.

            <strong>
             <strong>
              Kidnap victim Elizabeth Smart stormed out of a Utah courtroom today after a psychiatrist testified that she had baby names picked out in case she became pregnant by the man who held her captive.
             </strong>
            </strong>
           </p>
           <p>
            Psychiatrist Paul Whitehead told the court that Smart had been "chastised" by her accused kidnapper Brian David Mitchell and his accomplice, Wanda Barzee, according to The Associated Press.
           </p>
           <p>
            "
            <strong>
             <strong>
              Mr. Mitchell was talking with Miss Smart about having babies to the point where Miss Smart actually picked out a name in case that happened
             </strong>
            </strong>
            ," Whitehead testified.
           </p>
           <p>
            As Whitehead described Smart choosing a baby name,
            <strong>
             <strong>
              Smart left her front row seat in the courtroom and went to a private area
             </strong>
            </strong>
            . Her mother quickly followed."

            I do KNOW that --
           </p>
           <p>
            1)  We will never know what really happened in this case.
2)  Smarts' behavior was strange, especially the father's (Ed's).
3)  Smarts are very well connected crypto Jews.
4)  Walsh's America's Most Wanted is largely credited with raising awareness to help find her/them.  Adam Walsh's "kidnapping" is now highly suspicious since it led to the formation of NCMEC.
5)  This case was used as a media distraction (from Iraq War and other topics).  For that reason and #3, some suspect it was a staged event/hoax.

             How many posts of fake news and red herring TV shows on the McCann case, but none of the real story? Same with Jon Benet Ramsey.

             Mormons are very powerful. Not just Romney. People forget that the huge data collection center for all the spying is in Utah. No accident there.

             Like the those behind the scenes doing the pedo blackmails--its all about money.

             Smart said she know about weddings and what happens afterward. If only people knew how such their whole thing is, and it's not just the magics underwear, often with a "star of David" on it, the bride (sometimes 12 years old) is raped in their so called temple. And look at the polygamists....
