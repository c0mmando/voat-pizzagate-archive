<blockquote>
<p>The extreme abuse inflicted on young children in intra-familial satanic and abusive witchcraft cults reliably causes dissociation. Children in these cults are programmed to the extent that the cult’s leaders understand mind control programming. Organized and sophisticated abuser groups with world-power or organized crime agendas infiltrate these cults to gain access to these readily-programmable children. In exchange for the privilege of being allowed to install self-serving programs in these children, the organized abuser group provides the cult parent with a large fee (thousands of dollars), favor, or information, such as some of its programming secrets.</p>

<p>a quote from this story:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It would take forever to share my story, even in a nutshell, but we had cult members living in our home with us, monitoring us, drugging us, raping us, torturing, suffocating, etc...having full access to us 24/7, and of course, we were the \\&quot;crazy\\&quot; ones if we even said we didn\\\'t like the \\&quot;nice people\\&quot;. My supposed mom would disappear for a day, week, month, and come home with these people to live with us, and we always knew them as \\&quot;the homeless people\\&quot;, who \\&quot;just needed a place to stay\\&quot; for a day, week, month, year, or even several years. All of this went on in the average middle-class, \\&quot;Christian\\&quot; home. The \\&quot;front\\&quot; was that they were an extremely, extremely religious family, highly ethical, and would walk 100 miles to return a borrowed dime. Ha! What a load of ****!
I don\\\'t know why no one ever did anything; it seemed everyone knew something wasn\\\'t right about exposing kids to such dangers as homeless strangers. They came in all ages, groups, genders, mixes-couples, singles, families, male and female, teens to old people. What kind of parents allow anyone and everyone to just come live in a house with children...complete strangers, we were always told. Some \\&quot;left\\&quot; after a day or a few... but I question their fate. Other \\&quot;homeless\\&quot; people still come visit them, though we moved (abruptly, with about 3 week\\\'s notice, along with 4 or 5 other established, professional families who were \\&quot;friends\\&quot;), to a place nearly 3,000 miles away, where we all settled within 1/2-5 miles of each other. Not suspicious at all, is it? Why didn\\\'t we kids question any of it? Punishment. Severe. Never speak. Speak=die. Thinking=die. </p>

<p>Something about the way most of them are written, coupled with knowing that practicing therapists are encountering stories like these everywhere, makes me believe most of them are true. The victim perspectives fill in a lot of gaps of our understanding on the <strong>why?</strong> and the <strong>how</strong> the fuck are they doing this? and <em>who</em>? It explains Evie\'s Crib. It explains the kids running in the alley of CPP. Pegasus.Where are the victims? They\'re right in front of us.</p>',

             They give the kids drugs...  Probably every drug imaginable from anti-depressants to muscle relaxants to street drugs, cocaine, heroine, other opiates.   So when you see an abused child, all you will see is a 'homeless drug addict'.  Know what I mean?  You don't see them when they are being abused at 12 years old, you see them once they have been discarded at whatever, 16, 17, 18 years old.
            </p>
            <p>
             But mostly, I think a lot of the abused either develop Stockholm Syndrome (they become that which is abusing them), or they are killed.  The ones who can name names and have a strong will, I have no doubt they are 'dealt with'.  It must be pretty easy to tell which kids are 'handling the abuse well' and which ones are extremely strong-willed.

            I think this is probably the most important thread up at the moment,  and it is very important that this topic be understood well by the forum.  WHERE ARE THE VICTIMS?  Is the first question asked when anyone has any doubts about the pizzagate scandal.  If it wasn't for the sensationalism that existed at the height of this episode people would be more apt to understand.  Those of us that understand that James Alefantis is involved in something much more elaborate than simply running a prostitution ring understand how enormous this operation is. This is an elaborate multigenerational cult that uses their own children in extortion and influence schemes.  To these children of privilege,  childhood sexual abuse is the norm for them.  I'm not discounting the possibility that there really is 'Haitian specials'  being transferred for ritual or adoption but I guarantee you,  at the level these people operate,  you will never find any bodies.
           </p>

            Children involved with the cult get reabsorbed back into the cult,  the sexual abuse is the anchor that keeps them quiet their entire lives and perpetuates in the same cyclical fashion generation after generation.

            Great thread and this forum and the world has to understand how these elite operate.

            Love conquers all and love will turn any evil...agree with your assessments.  I have a high interest in psychology and actually have my minor in it.  From a science perspective, interesting how the programmers can break and disassociate and then rebuild a personality.  But what pure evil to do so...and from what survivors do say, while traumatic, they retain their "core" and who they really are..this is good and means that you cannot "make" someone evil..although certainly you can make them do evil things...

            A fair bit of forgiveness will be in order soon...but I sure ain't there yet...

            Trump and Trey Gowdy need to set up and fund a childrens advocacy organization for the limited purpose of providing legal assistance to victims who know their abusers. Referrals can be made to the proper authorities for prosecution. Referrals could be made to the tiny but growing number of personal injury lawyers who are suing for money damages. A 911 type emergency call system should be put into place which is limited to reports of sexual abuse or trafficking of children. Statutes of limitations should be revised to extend the time frame for bringing criminal or civil charges. Waiver of immunity should be put in place so public officials and employees can be sued for damages in their individual capacity. Forfeiture of retirement benefits should be implemented for any public official or employee found guilty  or found civilly liable. The death penalty should attach to anybody found guilty of murdering a child where SRA was part of the homicide. So on an so forth. Any other suggestions?

            Then the other side fought back with "repressed memory syndrome" and "satanic panic" BS.  Since the "professional xperts" were paraded around on television, everyone believed them.

             I highly recommend Russ Cheit's The Witch Finder Narrative for a look into the flaws of the "satanic panic" accusations.  He doesn't invoke MK ULTRA  or anything, he just illustrates how that narrative ignores the facts of the cases.

            Many victims cannot remember the abuse until years -- sometimes decades -- later.

             A close member of my family didn't remember until she was in her 50s. This was "just" molestation by her grandfather, no SRA or MK ULTRA stuff, yet it was so deeply traumatic that she didn't remember any of it until decades later.

            Just want to add a few thoughts that might help. Programming was created by psychoanalysts. The master minds behind MK Ultra were brought into the United States and installed in secret programs. Many were in Universities and Pyschiatric Institutions. These experiments happened to American children.
           </p>
           <p>
            Private Psychologists are now kept hidden from these truths. They in fact are trained in theory proposed by some who were involved in trauma based mind control experiments as Hitler came to power. Satanism has always been a part of it.
           </p>
           <p>
            The last Psychologist to write about this was D.C. Hammond possibly of UCLA in 1992.

            The crazy part is the media has paraded victims around for 40+ years and people still think that's a valid question.
           </p>
           <p>
            We saw them after the release of "Rosemary's Baby", it was written off as mass hysteria.
           </p>
           <p>
            Saw them in the '80's with Franklin and shit like the West Memphis Three... Written off again.

            You know, my grandpa taught me a pretty good research tactic I still use today.

           <p>
            "If somebody calls you a horse, you punch em in the mouth.
           </p>
           <p>
            Two people call you a horse, you get a nose job.
           </p>
           <p>
            But if three people call you a horse... It might be time to find a saddle."
