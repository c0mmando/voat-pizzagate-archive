<blockquote>
<p>Metrovest Equities and BDLG Management recently completed the acquisition of their new entity, Montauk Yacht Club Resort &amp; Marina. The two firms also own another company called Gurney Resort. Initially, the two companies had a capital of $55.6 million set for this purchase. The purchase was facilitated by ACORE Capital that gave the firms a renovation loan. ACORE Capital’s financing comprises of a mortgage loan as well as a mezzanine that is supposed to be paid within 60 months. The business was completed on 2nd May after a short discussion as almost everything had been agreed earlier on.</p>
<p>The newly acquired property is the second one that the company has in the Hamptons Hamlet. The other recreational property in this area is Gurney’s Montauk Resort &amp; Seawater Spa. In total, the companies have three resorts now having acquired another one in Newport in 2017.</p>
<p>..The New York Post newspaper first reported the news regarding the completion of the purchase deal. The paper said that the deal was closed after the two parties agreed on a $60 million payment. <strong>Island Global Yachting that is owned by Andrew Farkas previously owned this resort</strong>. It is built using the latest state of art technology and has a 232-slip marina that can hold vessels that are 220 feet long. </p>

<p>Montauk is the white-hot destination for the millennials on the most eastern tip of Long Island. Celebrities galore are being seen in Montauk as they were in the late 1960\'s and early 1970\'s when some of The Beatles, The Rolling Stones and the &quot;avant-garde&quot; friends of famous photographers Peter Beard and Andy Warhol were running around Montauk with their entourages. So let\'s look back to see how Montauk has evolved.  ..</p>
<p><strong>The Pearl Harbor aftermath had both the US Army and Navy come to Montauk</strong>. In 1942 Camp Hero (named after the Army\'s chief of coastal artillery of the 1920-1930\'s, Gen. Andrew Hero) was opened as part of the US coastal defense network. Also in 1942 the US Navy gave the residents of Montauk Village thirty days notice that it was going to demolish everything and locate a facility to test torpedoes. That was not real popular with the locals. </p>
<p><strong>Post WWII, the US Air Force came into Montauk</strong> and built the huge radar station to track Russian planes and missiles. They left for good in in 1981.  </p>
<p>During and after World War II there was a lot of new growth activity in changing Montauk. A prime example is the story of Gosman\'s dock. In 1943 Robert Gosman purchased what is now called Gosman\'s Dock from the Bonner Fuel Company. Roberta Gosman Donovan, Robert\'s daughter recalls, &quot;It was where people bought fuel, <strong>back then there were only two docks, Bonner\'s and the Montauk Yacht Club</strong>.&quot; In fact, before the dredging according to Roberta one could actually walk from Gosman\'s dock out to Star Island over the mud in the harbor. </p>
<p>&quot;In my memory, as an underage person then, the hottest (most notorious place) in the early \'70s was the Pirate\'s Den. It had an open rooftop strung with lights and everyone could see and hear people dancing at night,&quot; she said. &quot;It was fascinating and there weren\'t that many houses nearby.&quot; That locale is now The Sloppy Tuna. &quot;That building got a beautiful overhaul in the mid-70s and became the Sunrise. That was full day and night. Daytime drinks on the front deck, sometimes to go,&quot; added Delia. &quot;Mom and Dad would imbibe while the kids played in the ocean. At night, everyone 18 and up would flock there, nicely dressed to see and be seen, having dinner or dancing to disco music or just meeting summer loves. It was clean and light inside and out.&quot;  </p>
<p>At this same time, <strong>The Rolling Stones spent a summer staying at Andy Warhol\'s Montauk estate</strong>, reportedly drinking, playing pool and the piano at the <strong>Memory Hotel</strong>. </p>
<p>When asked about the 1980\'s, PJ Delia said, &quot;During the \'80s, that same place became a succession of other clubs. I think the Mimosa was the best one at that location in that time. <strong>The hottest place during the \'80s hands down was The Montauk Yacht Club.</strong> Celebrities and the extremely wealthy flocked there. Seaplanes were dropping off guests all day long, all week long. Fashions were started there, including the Members Only jackets, remember them?&quot; </p>

<p>I went to the opening weekend (April 30, 2008) of The Surf Lodge with Montauk legend Carl Darenberg. In ten seconds we both could see the change coming to Montauk. We were introduced to the next generation of folks discovering Montauk. The crowds that year were unbelievable. Soon what I call the &quot;Surf Lodge effect&quot; drew in the Hollywood superstars. Think about it, <strong>Leonardo DiCaprio</strong> could and would hang out in the south of France, or Malibu, or Miami, yet there he was now at the Surf Lodge in Montauk. That brings us to the present time where Montauk may be one of the centers of &quot;Millennial Culture.&quot; While the locals feel like the town is being invaded, it is really a new generation discovering &quot;The End&quot; of Long island via the &quot;scene&quot; in Montauk.  </p>

<p>On its furthest edges, the Montauk Air Force Station — also known as Camp Hero — is surrounded by fifteen-foot high razorwire fences, with each gated entrance clearly marked as government property, and that authorization of lethal force is permitted on trespassers. ...The central facility is a four-story concrete slab building, upon which rests an enormous AN/FPS-35 long range radar surrounded by smaller radar and satellite communications arrays. The entire eastern face of the building is consumed by overgrowth, and many of the ground floor windows have been boarded up after vandals shattered the glass in them. A paper notice pasted to the entrances notifies that the building is condemned, yet power substations nearby still hum with activity, and lights on the satellite arrays indicate there is still power going to the building. </p>
<p>Although the area is designated as part of Camp Hero State Park, fully one third of the grounds were off-limits to the public until 2003. <strong>Presently, a large area around the SAGE radar facility remains restricted.</strong></p>

           <blockquote>
            <p>
             [EDITOR'S NOTE: This case is unpublished as indicated by the issuing court.] MICHAEL D. STALLMAN, J.
            </p>
            <p>
             In this Article 78 proceeding, petitioner challenges a "non-responsibility determination" which precluded petitioner's eligibility for an award of two New York City Department of Sanitation (DSNY) contracts.
            </p>
            <p>
             Petitioner, a scrap-metal salvage and recycling corporation, submitted bids in January 2000 on two DSNY contracts involving processing and marketing of recovered metal. The DSNY Agency Chief Contracting Officer determined that petitioner was ineligible for the awards because it was non-responsible based on a record of environmental crimes and violations committed by it, and an affiliate company, at petitioner's branch location. Petitioner contends that the non-responsibility determination was arbitrary and capricious, contrary to law and made in violation of law. The Court notes that in this Article 78 proceeding, petitioner seeks to annul the ACCO's decision, which is not a final determination, [ see 9 Rules of the City of New York § 2-08(k)(6)], rather than the decision issued by the City's Chief Contracting Procurement Officer and Director of the Mayor's Office of Contracts, which is final, [ see 9 RCNY § 2-08(m)(6)]. The Court shall deem the petition addressed to the CCPO's decision; the City consents to this.
            </p>
            <p>
             ......It is undisputed that petitioner disclosed on its VENDEX questionnaires that on September 22, 1994,
             <strong>
              its "affiliate," S I Industries, Inc.
             </strong>
             , had pled guilty to attempted endangering public health and safety of the environment in the second degree, and paid a fine. Petitioner stated that
             <strong>
              two principals of S I, Louis and Ira Gershowitz
             </strong>
             , had no direct or indirect interest in petitioner, but that petitioner's president, Sam Gershowitz, was a "principal" of, and an "investor" in, S I.
            </p>
            <p>
             <strong>
              However, further investigation by The New York City Department of Investigation revealed that petitioner itself was the target of the underlying September 1994 criminal investigation which involved a complaint of large-scale soil and ground water contamination resulting from automotive fluid dumping during automobile dismantling operations at petitioner's Bay Shore location. Further, DOI reported that it was informed by the Suffolk County District Attorney's Office, that (1) these charges were resolved by a guilty plea offered by Gershow Recycling of Bay Shore, not S I, (2) petitioner had "consistently" violated the Vehicle and Traffic Law; and (3) Louis and Ira Gershowitz had been identified in public records as operators or managers of petitioner's Bay Shore branch.
             </strong>
            </p>
            <p>
             Based on the foregoing, the ACCO determined that petitioner was ineligible for awards of the contracts because it was non-responsible; petitioner was notified of this determination by letter dated May 2, 2001.
            </p>
            <p>
             Thereafter, petitioner filed an Agency Head Appeal by letter dated June 1, 2001. In the appeal, petitioner's counsel admitted that petitioner had been indicted under the circumstances described in the ACCO determination, but claimed that the charges were subsequently dismissed against it. Counsel also denied that petitioner had failed to complete its questionnaire truthfully, and that petitioner had consistently violated the VTL. However, petitioner's counsel failed to provide any documentation to support these contentions despite the express direction in 9 RCNY § 2-08(k)(2) that supporting documentation be included in appeals to Agency Heads. Instead, petitioner's counsel advised DSNY to look up the relevant records in the Suffolk County Clerk's Office. Petitioner's counsel offered no explanation for his failure to supply such documentation himself. Petitioner's counsel also stated that he "was prepared to provide detailed response" to the finding concerning VTL violations "once it had been provided by the Department with the details and basis of such accusation." Petitioner's counsel offered no explanation as to why he was unable to obtain the records of his client's criminal violations...
