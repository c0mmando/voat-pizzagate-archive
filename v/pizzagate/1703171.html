          <p>
           <p>
            This disgusting adoption racket aka institutionalized child theft was instigated by the Adoption and Safe Families Act signed by Bill Clinton in 1997. The law was written by, who else, Hillary.
           </p>
           <p>
            There are over a 110.000 US children adopted every year. Supply is unlikely to dry up because ASFA was  designed to use CPS for legalized child theft on the flimsiest evidence.
           </p>
           <p>
            But if it ever does there's also the pre-consent legal racket in which pregnant women from disadvantaged backgrounds are manipulated into signing their baby away, and even if there is a 72 hour post birth re-consent law in place, attorneys and adoption agencies will often conspire against the reluctant mother to steal the baby anyway.
           </p>
           <p>
            Of course those 110.000 adoptions a year often go wrong and the statistics for these children's futures are utterly depressing. But, the pedos, satanists and child exploiters have their virtually unlimited supply, and for each rehomed kid ten fresh kids will be available for new adoptions including subsidies (roughly half are subsidized)
           </p>
           <p>
            If you want to know how such an intensely evil system is allowed to fester unopposed, just count the politicians, judges, lawyers, child advocates, child psychologists and countless other powerful professions in the industry who have adopted children themselves.
           </p>
           <p>
            In fact attorneys hired by adoption agencies to pry babies away using pre consent often arrange for an adoption-friendly judge who has adopted children herself.
           </p>
           <p>
            This is basically class war with the children of the poorest as the prize.

           <p>
            They had a woman, who had her own children taken away for abuse and neglect. Her first husband was convicted of molesting and taking naked pictures of one of their foster kids also. She then remarried and took in two more children from a rehoming website. Those children were eventually rescued and it was found out later they had been sexually abused.
Years later, after the abuse came to light, the couple was found to have 5 more foster kids in their care! They are replaying it on Saturday for those who missed it. Must see for pizza gate researchers, such a sad and disgusting story.

             No, the children advertised in the top link that are offered for re-homing are mostly foreigners from Asia and from Haiti, they wouldn't send them back.  Reselling them means lining their pockets.

              Yes, I can see what you're saying ...
But aren't there usually US organizations that they work with to get the child?
I recall when adoption of Vietnam children was so prevalent here that there were organizations who were pretty much pushing
those adoptions (especially to volunteers who were involved with assisting the program/organizations.)
              <br/>
              Many church groups involved in moving these adoptions as I recall.
             </p>
             <p>
              Actually, I've been giving the adoption of Vietnamese children at that time a bit of thought lately because of the pedo-gate scandals.
Other nations also took in these "evacuated" Vietnamese children - Australia, for instance.
Large variety of cases involving these children at link.

               https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=Vietnames+children+adopted+in+US+
              </a>
             </p>
             <p>
              Also in reading again about the MLK, Jr. assassination where Wm. Pepper has made clear that our own government was involved
-- and there was even a TRIAL conducted some time back where certain individuals involved were found to be guilty, as well as
our government -- there are pictures in the book of a number of children in Vietnam was terribly damaged by NAPALM.
It just makes so clear that MLK, Jr.'s greatest threat to them was to be against the war in Vietnam.
Also makes you rethink the many horrible things our government did there -- just horrific.
Vietnam -- a beautiful country with beautiful people/children -- was destroyed because of our government's insane war on them.
And a PS on the assassination of MLK, Jr. is that Jesse Jackson was likely involved in setting it up.  It's actually thought that 
MLK, Jr. had come to know that Jackson was an enemy in his camp and may have been about to expose him.

               I'm not sure how it worked back during the Vietnam days but currently the children that were brought in from foreign countries and are assisting in placements get paid.  Each child is worth $1900 to the org. just for handling the placement and there is another $2000 available to the org. from our govt. if they supply that child with at least $200 worth of material assets such as clothing, etc. so it's very lucrative for them to do so.  Those funds aren't available for a disrupted adoption.  This is one reason why there is current outrage by those at the helm of those programs/orgs. in regards to the push against immigrants coming into the country.

                Neither am I sure how it worked, but they called the children "evacuees" and I know that there were church groups involved to some extent.
But certainly the government is always involved.  It looks like things have been arranged to provide profit for these organizations over 
safety of the children.

            I agree that rehoming is awful for kids and an unfortunate reality, and certainly with little oversight could result in trafficking, but what does this have to do with pizzagate?
           </p>
           <p>
            Pizzagate does open up a lot of discussion but I don't see this being a direct line to a child sex ring or anything really pizzagatey.

             We'll have to agree to disagree here.  In the case of rehoming I'll give you just one example with how an Arkansas state rep. rehomed his adopted daughters and how they were given to a pedophile.

             And in the cases for foster children how they are continually placed in homes with pedophiles.

             Statistics show that 70-75% of the children in the system are sexually abused.

            <p>
             This is just a minute sampling of the stories that are out there regarding children who have been sexually exploited by pedophiles who are fosters or adopters or even guardians if they've been re-homed.  The foster care system is just another avenue where children are trafficked  to these perverts.  Children don't have to be shipped into this country to be provided to pedos, they are also being supplied to them right under the public's nose through the system.

            Had no idea this was going on. Why it isn't stipulated that a family is required to contact the adoption agency to surrender the child back to them is beyond me. Have no idea why so much power rests with the adoptive family. They're really going to screen for a decent home when they can't even live up to their obligation? Insane. If anything goes wrong, it's the child that suffers.

            That is so sad. I read thru a lot of them. Some kids have grown up with these families for years. Suddenly, their inconvenienced?! It's as if they are finding new homes for their dogs. A pedo even gets to see their picture to help them decide who they're interested in. This is just wrong!

            Seeing how common this practice is has actually made me less hopeful of this forums cause. There are so many people doing this its unbelievable. Exposing this stuff can really change the world, but it will never end a practice that has been going on since a long time in history.
           </p>
           <p>
            Most people would find it hard to accept that the government is doing this, but to find that its this incredibly common is more surprising . For anybody who is having trouble accepting this just know that this was very common practice in Roman times, and even during the times of the pope and christian church. It is simply a crucial aspect of satanism. To a satanist a child has the most pure energy, and therefore they view that as the most sexually appealing thing. Even Aleister Crowley says this himself.

            Very disturbing and heart-wrenching to see children's profiles with photos on facebook, listed like they're a commodity like the way unwanted pets are listed on"pet finder". I strongly suspect the children are up for "resale" because when they were brought into their new home, they exhibited  behavioral/mental health issues. God knows what kind of abuses they suffered in the foreign countries they came from and God knows what type of environment they will next be shuttled into.
