<p>good evening. let me say up front that I don\'t care if you call me a shill. you might accuse me of trying to cause division, but these are legitimate and serious viewpoints held by respected voices within the truth movement. i\'m not going to spend a lot of time arguing the case as it\'s out there if you wanna see, so I only ask that you look at the evidence. and without further adieu...</p>

<p>basically, the idea is controlled opposition. they give you truths, gain your trust, and then keep you chasing your tail. evidence for AJ include never naming the Zionists, only calling them \'globalists,\' working for time warner, his lawyer being one of the elite, bad acting, disrupting peaceful protests and inciting violence, etc. etc. etc. lot\'s of evidence out there and on youtube.</p>
<p>with snowden, he\'s suspected of being a \'limited hangout.\' evidence includes not leaking anything we didn\'t already know, receiving MSM coverage (huge red flag), becoming a media darling, easy escape/lifestyle, talks like Obama, nothing the leaks contained changed corruption, the leaks were harmful to America\'s enemies, announcing \'leak dates\' like it is some news press release, etc. same goes for Assange. oh, and Assange says 9/11 conspiracy is fake.</p>
<p>you can do your own research and come to your own conclusion. i\'m not going to try to persuade you in this thread. the idea I want to entertain is: if it\'s true that they\'re all CIA ops, then that lends even <em>more</em> credence to pizzagate. think about it.. if everything that has been \'leaked\' so far has been a distraction, nothing new, and \'safe,\' for them to do so... then it explains how they didn\'t expect some 4chan super autists to spot only handfuls of code words in what were otherwise thousands of mundane e-mails with a few containing dirt on Hillary. it would mean they messed up. it was unintentional. they had to improvise. I know we are all desperate for our heroes, but it\'s even more crucial to teach ourselves to keep hope and not be depressed in the absence of such. me, personally—i\'m hoping for a gigantic natural disaster that sets them back a few hundred years. </p>

            First of all I'm not Jewish in case you were thinking I was. Secondly people have been trying to kill of "The Jews(tm)" for at least the past 2,000 years. Those aren't good odds either.
           </p>
           <p>
            Have you ever considered the possibility "The Jews(tm)" got to be "The Jews(tm)" because people are constantly trying to exterminate them?
           </p>
           <p>
            Look at France, there have been tons of terrorist attacks there lately. All that does is drive "The Jews(tm)" to seek refuge in Israel. Do I think the Rothschilds are behind the bombings for that very reason? Possibly but it doesn't matter. They've caught Muslims doing the bombing. That's enough. If this keeps up all "The Jews(tm)" on planet Earth will move to Israel and take over the Middle East.

            This isn't about Judaism, Islam or Christianity. This is about Good vs Evil. There are evil people everywhere. Judaism doesn't have a corner on that market. For proof look no further than George H.W. Bush. I remember when Hugo Chavez said he smelled sulfur while taking the podium after H.W.'s son W had finished a speech at the U.N.. I was kind of laughing that Chavez was so brainwashed by Socialism to have said that. Boy was I wrong. Sigh........

             throughout history, the jewish elite have been in cahoots with the ruling class (non-jews) to oppress. they throw us (including the common jew) under the bus. however, the usefulness to the elite of sacrificing the common jew is the elites then claim victimhood and are shielded from criticisms using 'anti-Semitism.'
            </p>
            <p>
             edit: biggest example of this is the ELITES exploiting the tragedy of the holocaust: the fire that annihilated hordes of common jews, combined with lies, forged the perfect ELITE shield called 'anti-semitism' that they use to shut down any shining light that attempts to expose their evil. the world must know of this.

              For that to be true George H.W. Bush and Hillary Clinton would need to be puppets incapable of making their own decisions.

              But that's clearly not true. The only money we see buying influence is from the Saudis and possibly the Russian if you look at Uranium One and lobby money paid to the Podesta brothers.

                My only point would be what we're witnessing down in DC has been going on for at least the past 5,000 years. Rich people continually try to fuck over poor people. It's nothing new.

                 no, of course not. for all we know, there are forces above controlling the Rothschild's that are entirely non-Jewish in origin, and have been on top for millennia. i'm only pushing back against what I see as you minimising the obvious role that they play, and the dangerous liability of being smeared 'anti-semitic' if one dares point that out.

            Sure, we should listen to everyone but blindly follow no-one. But you've made a lot of blanket statements in here which don't really hold up to close scrutiny.

            Nonsense. The Snowden revelations were an absolute bombshell and deeply embarrassed the NSA. The real problem is only a few thousand documents have been released out of a promised hundreds of thousands.

            Not really a red flag at all. Detailed leaks on how the NSA spies on the world's communications was newsworthy.

            I'm not sure if you've noticed but Assange has been holed up in a foreign embassy in London for six years because of Wikileaks. Wikileaks has a 100% accuracy record in over ten years of leaking, something no other media organisation on the planet can claim. Indeed, Pizzagate would not EXIST without Wikileaks and none of us would be here.
           </p>

             then it explains how they didn't expect some 4chan super autists to spot only handfuls of code words in what were otherwise thousands of mundane e-mails with a few containing dirt on Hillary.

           <p>
            One of the most powerful and corrupt people in the world for fifty years now - Henry Kissinger - says, and I quote, 'Trump has no baggage.' The Big Three agencies - the CIA, the Mossad and GHCQ - have been trying for 18 months to find any dirt on him. All they have managed is some obvious fan fiction from 4chan (Pissgate) and some locker room banter from 11 years ago. If they had one single thing on Trump they would have leaked it by now and he would have lost the election.
           </p>
           <p>
            It is very very difficult to really know what's going on behind the scenes in a situation like this. Personally, I think it's quite likely that Snowden was a pawn used by the CIA to discredit the NSA in the inter-agency wars that have been going on for some time now. I also know that I'm unlikely to agree with anyone on absolutely everything: maybe the other party is more informed than I, maybe I'm the one with more information and the valid theory.

             how was snowden confirming something everyone knew a 'bombshell'?? where is the new info on JFK, 9/11? hmm? the problem you acknowledge is suspicious as well. it was 'newsworthy'? why wasn't pizzagate considered 'newsworthy'? why does the whole world adore snowden while he's living it up with his stripper girlfriend in Russia, while heroes like Chelsea manning get 35 years and are completely unknown to people like my mother? you seem to have much faith in the mainstream media. also, snowden speaks the same lawyer way Obama does, if that wasn't already obvious. did you even read the article included?

            They made a point of saying we can't keep relying on other people to lead or do things for us. We have to organize ourselves, become our own leaders, and do things for ourselves. I couldn't agree more. It would be easier to let someone do all of the hard work, but we've got to come to terms with the fact that no one has our backs; no one is going to open doors for us; no one is going to be our guiding light. We have to do this on our own. Hopefully people realize this soon and start taking organizing seriously.

            They are and there is more than enough evidence to demonstrate this.  I wish people would sharpen the fuck up as we've already wasted enough time chasing our tails with these Pied Pipers!

            I was heartbroken to find out even Snowden is a shill. Once CIA, always CIA though, right? It was Sibel Endmonds who red pilled me on this, and I hated her for it for a good half year, before finally succumbing to the truth. Snowden pushed the use of Tor, which is an NSA honeypot, started by and still funded by the NSA, as well as pushing the "USA Freedom Act" in response to American's anger after finding out about the illegal spying. It actually made LEGAL the very loopholes we were all complaining about. Wikipedia  has a good page on this (you're welcome ;).

            And apparently when Wikileaks was first launched, TIME magazine announced them as the first "leak" site, before they had leaked even one thing! TIME is a mouthpiece of the State,. Why would the establishment want to announce something that threatened it???

             Jesus? All we have is each other sure but now is a better time than any for Jesus to show and until he does it would seem we are all we have. Im sorry but if there really is a Jesus he isn't on our side it would seem as all we do is sit a gather evidence of unspeakable crimes against humanity and children and none if it is helping stop any of it. If I was Jesus I would be helping right now. Some deity.

            That's why I have not any heroes or idols.  I don't follow any of the PG Stars.  I don't have the time.  If they all turn out to be shills,  we have had our bubbles burst before.  The worst thing about this whole mess is having to deal with the rape of the children everyday.  A few shills?  We'll kick them aside and keep on going.

            "never naming the Zionists, only calling them 'globalists,' "
           </p>
           <p>
            That's easily explained by the desire to avoid being accused of antisemitism.
           </p>
           <p>
            I think you still have a point though. I've followed this story for 6 months now and I've gotten a feel for all the players. There are many different layers and allegiances that start jumping out of the background. Long story short I think what we're seeing with Alex Jones, Mike Cernovich and George Webb are people at the CIA and Mossad starting to take "The High Road". Maybe that's in stories they start feeding them? I know Mike Cernovich has gotten an awful lot of scoops lately. And mind you I like Mike Cernovich and everyone knows I think George Webb should be the next President of the United States. I'm no anti-semite but you've got to expect these people to have contingency plans.
           </p>
           <p>
            I think Hillary Clinton losing caught a lot of people off guard and changed the balance of power in a big way. Somewhat cynically I believe there was an un-holy alliance to create ISIS between the CIA, Mossad, the Muslim Brotherhood and the Saudis.  You don't have to be a genius to figure out why that alliance is collapsing.
           </p>
           <p>
            So what do these various Intelligence Communities do? They start adapting to the new balance of power. And the first thing to go down the shitter is the Muslim Brotherhood alliance with Mossad. I think Mike Cernovich and George Webb could be the Israelis "turning states evidence". In other words they could be the start of Israel "singing like a canary" in the court of public opinion. We've got to remember these are "The Jews(tm)" and they're sharp as a fucking tack and it's no surprise they're trying to get ahead of this thing.
           </p>
           <p>
            Israel is in a very tough position because they could potentially lose a lot of support, namely the Christian Right of which I'd say I'm a member of. And to be honest some of what we've all seen in the past 6 months would make any American an instant isolationist. That would leave Israel potentially high and dry. So Israel throws the Muslim Brotherhood under the bus. As always I could be wrong, but that's what my gut is telling me at this point.

             I have wondered about Cernovich too.... he is linked to Alan Dershowitz who was accused with Epstine of pedophilia.  We always need to be careful who we trust.

              Absolutely. I couldn't agree more. But there are several layers of fraud going on here. None of the players are smelling like roses at this point. I view Cernovich and George Webb as sort of a peace offering of sorts. It doesn't feel right to ignore it.

             <p>
              I've see parts of the CIA doing the same thing. The group who's silence is deafening right now is the Muslim Brotherhood. It really looks like they're being set up as the "Fall Guy". You'd think they'd be starting to explore olive trees for branches to cut to use a corny analogy but I couldn't think of anything better.

                The Saudis? Good question, I kind of think they and the Muslim Brotherhood are tied at the hip. They're definitely not the same group though. It'll be interesting to see how the Saudis play this. If I had to guess there doing all they can to buy influence. Maybe that's where this supposed $30 Billion payment to Trump is coming from?
               </p>
               <p>
                Who knows though, I don't see how this cluster fuck can survive the Deplorable Horde Army centipede attack. The crimes the Deep State has committed are fucking horrible. People can't just forget about it. And the Interwebs means it's not just American citizens who've gotten involved. It's the entire planet. That doesn't bode well for sweeping this under the rug.

                 Yes I think these "brotherhoods" are all connected either by allies or enemies.

                 $30billion. Wow. My guess is the Saudis.
                </p>
                <p>
                 In Michael Moores (apologies) Fahrenheit 911 they said Saudis own about 7% of America .. and that was 2004!
                </p>
                <p>
                 Too many times it has been said that every government is connected through child abuse. I believe it. Also think UN is a huge piece of this PG puzzle.

                <p>
                 There is no sweeping this under the rug. They can't heart attack and suicide us all. They fucked there chance at starting WW3 with Russia. What is their next move .. We will not stop until innocent children are no longer suffering.

             Nice to see someone else who's informed on what's actually afoot.  If people would just start to see the whole schema as more of a game of fantastic mental agility being played against us, we'd have a better chance at stopping the jackboot from kicking our ass!  The majority of people who have a large following on social media and/or get global press coverage ARE cointelpro.  Why would this not be the case as it's an easy to produce, manage and multiply operation.  Who gave us the modern media and internet in the first place?!

             We are facing an adversary that is tiny in physical force but overwhelmingly superior in nous, experience, cognisance, focus Ad nauseam... Our advantage however is the hive mind and sheer unstoppable momentum once we can get the scales tipped!

              I can assure you the probability the Deep State is going down is rapidly approaching 100%. Freedom of Speech can defeat any dictatorship. That's why they're trying so hard to destroy Freedom of Speech. They know it'll be the death of them. The pen is mightier than the sword.
