            This is the exact same bust I posted here:
            <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/v/pizzagate/1429231">

            What's notable is the comment section. A guy talks about illuminati tarnishing his name and references a "without borders" type group involved in trafficking kids through Cambodia. Guy posted a week ago and seems like a well-known Canadian voice-actor for video games, etc. so I think it'd be worth reaching out to him. Books With No Borders seems similar to Beyond Borders (anti-trafficking Haiti kids) backed by HRC near Comet/Besta Pizza and we know HRC is tied to trafficking kids in Haiti...

             Among those arrested were 40 school teachers, nine doctors and nurses, six law enforcement personnel, nine pastors and priests and three foster parents, she said.

             Citing a particularly egregious example, she said police found over 350,000 images and over 9,000 videos of child sexual abuse in the home of a retired Canadian school teacher. Some of the images were of children known to the man and he was also charged with sexually abusing a child relative.
The inspector said an indispensable aspect to the success of the operation and the rescue of 386 children from child exploitation was the expansive cooperation between Toronto police and organizations worldwide.
“[This] confirms that when we work together regardless of the borders that divide us we can successfully take down those who not only prey on our most vulnerable but also profit from it,” she said.
            </p>
            <p>
             Police said the children were "rescued from child exploitation" but did not give more details.
