            Will you give up the character assassination already? You're pathetic. None of this even is evidence against pizzagate you retard shill. Even if Seaman wasn't around all the evidence is still there. You're butthurt he has a large audience he can push info out to.

             Nope, I'm 'butthurt' that an extremely important investigation is being funneled through a gatekeeper, just like they have long bottlenecked other kinds of conspiracy research and critical enquiry at the gates of other establishment shills like Alex Jones, Joe Rogan, Noam Chomsky, etc.

              David isn't a "gatekeeper." He's barely an investigator and has admitted this and we all know it. He gets the info out to his followers. You're either an idiot or just another brainless shill following the same lame attack script  You morons bringing him up is actually good for giving him more attention. We just have to point out how fuckin stupid all of you are.

               No, I'm someone who notices how they always bottleneck conspiracy investigations through one cointel shill who blows it at some point to derail and discredit the investigation, through their crazy antics (Alex Jones), crazy theories (Seaman), crazy look (Ace Baker), etc. Or they just quit at a chosen time and the investigation peters out. They do this so that people place their hope in someone else and become mere observers to the investigation watching something on TV (or Youtube) rather than active participants in it. When you quack like a duck enough times and in enough different tones, you've shown yourself to be one.

            I think you are a bit twisted up on the situation, David Seaman is a shill - he is a Talmudist and he is likely a controlled opposition asset of the Rothschilds spearheaded by Charles (The little monster Chucky's more humanesque "cousin").
           </p>
           <p>
            He puts out this type of simulation supposition as if he can really wrap his brain around it, yet he is a rabid Flat Earth denier and I have yet to hear him discuss the Mandela Effect.
           </p>
           <p>
            The truth of the matter is that we are living in a GOD supercomputer under the ground, and we are PILOTING our biomechanical human bodies. The brain does not function as we are led to believe it receives quantum entangled images from the GOD computer, also the body does not create enough electric to run the human heart, that is part of the WORLD MAGIC - and is actually part of the magical system of the world. The beating of the heart is attributed to a throw by our node queen, who happens to be on the very worst settings possible making her aptly named THE QUEEN OF PAIN.
           </p>
           <p>
            Sun heat is also faked, if you have trouble wrapping your brain around that see my article:

              You may have some waking up to do - the Rothschilds are like the API for world change, outside forces implement major world changes by the Rothschilds, they are a boots-on-the-ground type of "family". They often implement changes taking credit for them as if they were their own ideas yet do not know they are implementing the will of others. They didn't know the Earth was Flat until recently, neither did Obama or the presidents before him - Trump knows because I told him. The Mandela effect is a real phenomenon that could be implemented in several ways and likely is. The Fake Sun is legit, if you research my blog's data and have half a brain you should be able to figure that out for yourself. As far as the total simulation stuff goes, it doesn't really matter except that you better treat AI video game characters the same as you would a stranger that you have control over in the world.

              Easy to call everyone a shill, this is my real name I post under - look me up on YouTube and read some of my posts if you want to wake up.
