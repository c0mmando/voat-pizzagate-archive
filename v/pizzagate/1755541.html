            I commend you for eloquently describing how all of us feel, very beautifully written. Not only is this absolute nightmare heartbreaking, along with so many other emotions, but incredibly frustrating. This is not something you can rationalize in your mind because it is so inhuman and depraved that one with a soul simply cannot comprehend the magnitude of evil. Once you know this, this is not something you can just walk away from. You don't go back to business as usual and restlessness and frustration haunts you and devours you. Every piece of evidence we uncover, these monsters are 2 steps ahead trying to hinder our efforts. When I think of the vastness and how farreaching this cancer spreads, I can only think of two solutions both of which are very difficult. The only chance we have ourselves is in numbers. Spread awareness, show people you are close to the most damning indisputable evidence and encourage them to pass the information to others and hope it spreads like wildfire. If there are more people aware of Pizzagate and demanding an investigation the less our voices can be drowned out by these monsters. But that still isn't going to be enough. We need God. We need to reach out to Him and pray with all our hearts and souls to put an end to this nightmare we're faced with. I know firsthand the power of prayer and it truly does work. This isn't about religion, religion means nothing. This is about having a relationship with Christ and our Father.

            Read about the Dutroux Affair in Belgium.  People were in the streets with outrage.  Yet, very little came as a result, despite a scaffolding of massive proportions being revealed.
           </p>
           <p>
            The fact is, people don't want this as a part of their reality.  They might come to an awareness and seek to correct, but at the first chance offered to turn away, they will take it with relief.  Really, the only hope is with Trump, because we've had a mountain of evidence before and it was all just quietly explained away.  Will he, won't he?  Is he even genuine?  I can't tell you, but I can tell you that this is a subject I've been following for decades and everytime hope arises, I watch as it just washes away.
           </p>
           <p>
            Now, I don't wish to destroy anyone's hopes.  The fact is, we are all morally bound to see it through as best we can.  But, I do think one should remain cognizant of the unwillingness of the general populous to face this head-on.  Willful ignorance is our greatest enemy because it is only apathy that allows this to continue.

            Sadly I fear this is right. The American people are on average too greedy and too selfish to acknowledge the horrific truth that is staring them in the face. They don't want their comfy little bubble popped. What would that mean for them?
           </p>
           <p>
            However, fearing that this is the case does not give us leave to shrug and walk away (not saying this is what you suggested! I say this to exhort myself as much as anyone else) not when little kids are being victimized. Otherwise we are just as bad and lazy as the rest. None of us should stop paying attention and attempting to raise awareness. Don't let the brainstorming for ideas stop. None of us should stop trying to do what we can do, even if it feels like it isn't enough and it isn't working. I keep praying that there are still just enough decent folks left in this country to sway things for the better, and that something will happen. I don't plan to stop. The fact is there IS progress. Trafficking busts are happening every day and children are being rescued. Awareness about sex trafficking is being raised. That IS something to cheer about, even if our thirst for justice and vengeance has not yet been quenched.

            There are still too many people with heir heads planted firmly in the sand.  They are the talking animals, the cattle, the goyim and they are your true resistance, not the elites you decry.  They will resist your truths in favor of the comfortable lies which they have been fed repeatedly until they believe the lies.  They will report your truths to the thought police because they're not comfortable with the change you represent.  It's not the millenial generation that's really the problem, the problem is our parents generation that grew up in the era of WWII spoils and let their kids grow up soft.

            Instead of making insane rationalizations to explain why nothing is materializing out of pizzagate, maybe you should strap some common sense in and admit that you were wrong and that you bought into a fictitious conspiracy theory. But hey, then you wouldn't be an insane conspiratard.

            The DC pedoring must continue to operate for the US gov to maintain its power. It involves both sides of the aisle and multiple intelligence agencies and foreign states such as Israel and Saudi Arabia. Both sides the left and right want to keep it going. That's why Alex was forced to speak out for the Ashkenazi Mossad gang. They'll let a few rings on the periphery get busted, but it won't reach too far to the top. After listening to Alex covering for the Mossad again thru lies by omission on 911, it's clear that humanity is stuck in the middle of some high level elite gang war, presumably zionists vs. Globalists. Alex and Trump are all in with the zionists. So few people can discern just how truly deceptive Alex has been in protecting Israel that it will be a long time before any of this is put to a stop. The Mossad uses political pedophilia for power and control and that they do have over the US. If the US can somehow untangle itself from existing for Israel and her foreign policy, we then may have a chance at truly draining the swamp to find independence. As it stands now, the cabal and their cliques have drawn a line in the sand, the DC pedoring is off the table. It's too valuable for Israel and the Saudis to lose and it would bring about the total collapse of the US government.

            I've lost most of my hope that any of the big names will go down as pedos.  But after following George Webb for several months, I know there are plenty of more provable crimes that can sink a bunch of people.... or an entire government.

            The increased scrutiny and awareness has to have some real, ongoing dampening, chilling effect on the trafficking.  There will be some missed associations and connections.  More suspicion amongst the rings.  Fewer sales, and more contracts broken or delayed. There will be higher bribes demanded because the risk is greater.  With increased attention, the "backmail events" will be less casually attended, less out in the open.  There have been a lot of major arrests and investigations launched internationally, which puts bites and chinks in the chain of operations.   Small fry are more likely to say no, to call the police, to blow the whistle.  Parents are more watchful and more children have been prepared and warned to protect themselves and speak up.  The mid range mayors, state senators, university staff and others have seen a number of theirs going down.  Their fear is maybe for the first time, on the rise.
           </p>
           <p>
            There is a portion of the population that is aware and with that, awareness only grows, it does not decline.  That is our strength.   Certainly whatever activities were being conducted at CPP and Besta are suppressed.  At the top of the government, very real messages about a focus on human trafficking have been given - this does not go unnoticed by the guilty.
           </p>
           <p>
            Largepepperoni said further down "Trump's executive order that instructed the intelligence communities to report to him on the transnational criminal organization involved in trafficking gave them 120 days to hand over the evidence. That was on February 9th I believe."
           </p>
           <p>
            It is a strong probability that a few less innocent souls have suffered.  That makes all of our attention and efforts  more than worth it.
           </p>
           <p>
            Stay vigilant and strong.  For the innocent ones.

            I say this out of empathy.
           </p>
           <p>
            I'm sorry to say, but you've been had.  FBIAnon was a fake.  The codewords were fake.   John Podesta does talk about food that way.
           </p>
           <p>
            There was someone who posted here who claimed to be with an agency and she said FBIanon was an obvious fake.  She also claimed that every single FBI agent she knew would not let these crimes continue like FBIAnon was.   They would have put a stop to it then and there.  In fact, she called him a pussy and asked why he didn't take his government issued firearm and go get the kids as she would have done.  She wanted folks on here to direct their energy on a real fight.  Mods deleted her thread of course.
           </p>
           <p>
            Ask yourself this, with all that is known, with people pouring months into "investigating,"  is there anything that could be prosecuted.  Anything real  that points to an actual and specific crime that you could go to judge and get a warrant for Hillary or the Podestas or Alefantis?  When you look at that way, you have to admit there's nothing.  Closest thing is what?  A picture of a girl with masking tape on her posted to a public website?
           </p>
           <p>
            You mentioned Bill, Hillary and Wiener and the dark cloud in your mind. Strip away all the conjecture and the maybes and the might of beens and what do you have?   You have a pile of suspicions and no actual crimes.   This is why there is a sudden need on this board to try and connect that to other cases or change the name of pizzagate or claim Comet Ping Pong is not the center of the story.  It's because people are realizing they've hit a deadend.   They might not be saying it out loud, but at some level they know it and this is why strategies are changing.
           </p>
           <p>
            Some folks will be deadenders.  They've already believed in elite conspiracies where all officials work against them and they've believe these many, many years.  They'll give this up soon and work it into the next big conspiracy that comes along.
           </p>
           <p>
            Here's the real deal.
The FBI has not gathered evidence that is going to bring down dozens of well known politicians. That was simply made up.  It's not that THE POWERS THAT BE were holding things back, this was simply a lie
           </p>
           <p>
            Attorney General Sessions is not going to come in and clean house.  Both he and Trump know "the lock her up chants" were just campaign noise. They never meant it and they knew they could never back it up.  People who believed those campaign slogans are just finding this out.  Basically none of the recent arrests for child trafficking would have been any different if Loretta Lynch was still Attorney General or a different AG was picked.  Those operations take some time to put together and they are most local law enforcement.   If Sessions is going to have some big initiative, it would come later and he would face the same issues of resources, manpower and money that all Law Enforcement agencies face.
           </p>
           <p>
            There's no big jackpot waiting on the Anthony Weiner laptop.  Given what we know about the Wiener case.  He is the single person in legal jeopardy.  Anybody who told you different was pulling one over on you.  My prediction is that Wiener will plead and when he does it will not be to a major charge.  I base this on the fact that the girl's family is acting hinky.  They are not cooperating with prosecutors and that the girl or her family deliberately preserved evidence.  If you look at the first Daily Mail story, something odd is going on.   She reached out to Weiner.  Supposedly the only two people who knew this was going on were her and Weiner and yet the Daily Mail found out somehow?  Who told them?  Her? Weiner? Her Family?   Did Weiner get hacked?  There's something odd about this case, we don't know yet.
           </p>
           <p>
            Can I ask a question?  How did that dark cloud in your mind get made?   Is there really evidence to support it? Evidence of actual crimes?  Crimes that involve  Bill and Hillary Clinton like you mentioned?  Really?   Or is most of the support to build this cloud were really just dark suspicions that are not tangible.  My genuine and sincere advice is to look at that dark cloud you mention and ask what is real?  What is fueling that?  Is there real fuel for that?

             You think people are just going to give up and move on with their lives?  Continue living in a world where psychopathic pedophiles rule? Do you think you can normalize that?  Or that people will just accept it?  That's not what's going to happen, I'm afraid to tell you. A whole lot of people are going to die and there's nothing anyone can do about it at this point.  Pandora is already out of the box.

              No.   A lot of people are going to try to figure out to direct their energy against real pedophiles and traffickers.

               Edgar Welch is a false flag, so no, it wouldn't go that way.  Any attempts by an average citizen would result in them facing 20-life or being mowed down. But, Harry's son get's a secret plea deal for being such a good actor!

            If we leave it up to them it could go on forever, for they will never have enough.  It is an addiction that will never end and gets worse day by day.  They will have to be stopped by us, that is the only way.  Some of this  has been going on for decades and some for centuries.  It will not end overnight or quickly just because we want it to.  The reason we are all getting impatient is because of the horror of it all. Yes, we all want to stop the horrible things being done to children and adults as well, but we are all they have and we are doing the best we can. There are days when I think I can not read about one more heinous story, but then I go to bed and pray and get up the next day to continue on, just like you and the many members here.  Remember.  We are fighting TPTB.

            Agree and well said. I am usually one of the ones encouraging patience and having faith and I do still have both of those but agree very much with what you have written. I know many of us are not willing to let another time of scandal and awareness slip away again. However, I too also wonder how long we carry on in life raising awareness and shining a bright light where it needs to be shone when we also know there is a terrible evil walking amongst us appearing as good. And that evil is destroying our most innocent and vulnerable. We need to do more and I don't have the answers either

            Amen. When I pray I ask God, ' How long O Lord? How long will the wicked flourish?' I pray for the wicked, that their hearts would be changed, that they would repent and confess- and ultimately cease their evil deeds- but I know that aspect of my prayer is in vain. So instead I implore the God of heaven and earth, He who is the First and the Last, the Alpha and the Omega the Beginning and the End for justice for the innocent victims. GOD Almighty is sovereign..heaven is His throne and earth is his footstool....praise Him, exalt Him, implore Him...He is faithful. And may His hand of protection and blessing be upon every researcher who is anointed here to expose the evil. Amen.

            Anyone around during the Franklin Coverup?

           <p>
            We do not gather "evidence."  We are not LE and we do not have search warrants (which are used to gather evidence, along with affidavits, etc.)
           </p>
           <p>
            You can gather tons of connections and suspicious internet material, then you have to forward/present it to the proper jurisdictional LE.  After that, it is up to THEM to do something about it.  That has already been done in Washington, D.C. (see Titus Frost), and of course nothing came of it.
           </p>
           <p>
            It's time to think about what the Plan B will be should they decide not to act because they probably won't.
           </p>
           <p>
            Even IF they do act, certain individuals are SOVEREIGNS OF ROYAL BLOOD so are "untouchable."  That includes HItlery.

             This.
             <br/>
             Nearly every day I get frustrated, searching for the missing piece to bring it all together in such a way that it can no longer be denied and/or ignored. Only to realize that even if I/we did find it, who will do anything about it? And is the Swamp,  indeed,  drained enough that ANYTHING would happen even if they tried?  So maybe that's the wrong approach. We aren't here to solve the crime, per se. People with resources far greater than us are needed for that.  Then again,  I'm sure since nearly everyone in dc is probably complicit they haven't done a great job covering their tracks on the inside. But what do we do to stop it? Where does our power lie? If we hammer with the truth even half as much as they hammer with lies, the message is bound to spread.  Our power lies in communication,  in making the truth known, in no longer ignoring the liars but speaking out against them. 10 silent people on a corner with signs will reach hundreds of eyes. The sign in your yard will reach hundreds of eyes. The #pizzagate (or whatever tag) on your money will reach countless. The stickers at the bus stop. The paper in the book at the library.  Wherever.  And eventually the message will grow, and the truth will be seen so often that it will be in the undercurrent of our psyches, just like their pedo crap is all around us right now, in plain sight, under our noses.
            </p>
            <p>
             Yes, Plan B. Where does our power lie? What is the most effective use of our energies and resources and capabilities?
            </p>
            <p>
             And p.s. I'm not saying quit researching. Just advocating thinking beyond/in addition to.

            What scares me is if the Trump had anything on related to pizza/pedogate he would be playing his cards RIGHT NOW. With himself under investigation, he hasn't been shy to throw anyone under the bqus via twitter. It worries me that Trump has nothing but a Russia connection on the HRC clan. Wait and see. Investigate. Spread the word. Wait and see. Rinse and repeat.....

             Not necessarily, Trump is not worried about this Russia thing.  Anyone with an ounce of critical reasoning can easily determine that the whole Trump-Russia thing is complete BS.

            My stance is that this whole thing is being bogged down by politics. Trump seems like he genuinely wants to do something about the corruption in our country, including, but not limited to Pedogate. But with no solid accomplishments to run on, He can't reasonably shake up the political landscape like that and risk the midterms, let alone his reelection. This guy needs 8 years to drain the swamp, so we need to give him his first 100 days to get something worth talking about finished. It won't be healthcare, so hopefully it'll be tax reform and the start of the wall. Once he has something, he can start doing things that could very well get him in trouble. He can remove Comey, and then he can get to work purging the Obama leftovers, investigating Podesta for Russian connections (the sweet irony) and pressing him to spill info on the Clintons and Alefantis. If the first 100 days come and go and there is nothing, we'll see. But I really think we're close. I really believe that this will be blown wide open soon.

             I read today that Trump asked for Comey's resignation on April 1st.  He can't fire him because he's tenured so his hands are tied so all that Trump can do is keep paying Comey, let him keep his title but not let him work in his official capacity.  Trey Gowdy is being tapped to step in.  Comey has been playing offense and defense from the beginning.  I always thought he was a straight shooter but he's on Hillary's payroll.

               I had to look it up.  Presidents can fire FBI directors but it's only happened once in history.  I think Trump is hoping that he'll go quietly so the Dems don't howl and say that he fired Obama's tenured director.  My guess is that it's just semantics.  I can't find the source where I read it because I usually only lurk around this site, rarely post.  Didn't think to bookmark.

             Children and adults and being tortured DAILY, HOURLY, BY THE MINUTE. By comparison, much as I'd love to pay less taxes, people are being tortured!!! If Trump was serious about going after all the POS who are behind these horrors, he'd be ON it! Not, oh, well, it can wait another 100 days, let's get that tax thing sorted out first. And oh yeah, we should take care of that wall. Wet concrete sets up fast so we gotta take care of that pronto. And if I run out of time, that's okay. I can just run again and take care of these victims in my second term, if I get re-elected. Nope, nope, nope!

              I'm not saying it's my priority, but from a political standpoint, it makes sense to accomplish something before he literally risks his life draining the swamp. Think about all the moving parts in making this possible. Comey has to go, the CIA needs to be investigated. This is a really, really risky operation, and the people he's up against have killed sitting Presidents before. I'm not saying he finishes the wall, I'm just saying he starts it.

                 All it will take is an EMP to end the country.  Or, the people so angry that they burn every major city, media outlet, government building, corporation, etc...  to the ground.  It wouldn't take much for that at this point.

                  I really don't think an EMP would end the country. Knock us back significantly, yes. But I'm confident that it wouldn't be enough to end the country. Trade would screech to a halt, trillions in wealth would be erased (between catastrophic loss of financial data, inevitable crime waves, and the sheer amount of electronics rendered useless) and the federal government would likely collapse, but an EMP wouldn't seal the deal. It'd take a comprehensive nuclear strike, targeting not just the major cities, but flyover states as well, to take us down, and that's still a risky play, because you bet your ass that the government would load bunker busters onto drones and take out whoever launched at us, meanwhile, I'd say a couple hundred thousand people (out of 300,000,000) would survive.

                  War in the conventional sense isn't what'll kill America. Our downfall will be the climax of a psychological war, and I believe one such conflict has been ongoing since the end of WWII.

            I'm thinking the big ones won't happen till June at the earliest. Trump's executive order that instructed the intelligence communities to report to him on the transnational criminal organization involved in trafficking gave them 120 days to hand over the evidence. That was on February 9th I believe.

            Man I ditched voat for the chans for a fortnight for this exact reason, I'm so sick of all the false dawns and repeat posts it's driving me crazy.  I truly hope that the the noise we've been making about this has saved some kids from being abused but I also worry that it hasn't and if this doesn't come out after all of this their operations will get worse because they'll feel invincible.  We need to keep the faith but I have to say I now skip right past the type of articles you mentioned, it pains me to say it but I will only believe something is in the pipeline when the msm cover it.

            There was a comment on voat today about a child porn ring in Punjab pakistan. Looking into the wiki page thebudual story was told. Hundreds of kids, videos, blackmail, bullshit response by police and politicians until the riots began.
           </p>

            In about 30 days it will be 6 months or rape and torture of kids, so let me post a few questions and statements.
           </p>
           <p>
            What if there are pedos in high level at local state and federal police then what?
           </p>
           <p>
            What if high level entertainment industry, media, news folks are involved or being blackmailed into silence?
           </p>
           <p>
            Who watches the watchers? What if the people who are to protect, prosecute and inform have been infiltrated from the ground up?
           </p>
           <p>
            Remember Jimmy saville was taking kids out of hospital beds and raping them in the basement along with doctors and nurses present. One victim talked about robes and masks being used like some form of ritual.
           </p>
           <p>
            Prime Minister Ted Heath who was accused raping and killing kids is being investigated and the findings will be kept secret.
MI6 and MI5 had no idea about saville who was friends with the royals or the prime minister?
           </p>
           <p>
            Breitbart, Hastings, Nancy Schaefer, Ben Swann nuking his social accounts, Alex Judas Jones shutting up, Corey Feldman afraid to name names.  What could be so dark and deadly that people are afraid to speak out?  Could these people be so organized and intertwined into every part of life? 
The military delay tactic is being used. Every week it's "next week xyz is going to happen". This gives the rapist more time to organize and neutralize.
           </p>
           <p>
            I've noticed over the years the fear porn peddler Alex Judas Jones always shuts down a guest who wants to pose activist solutions. Judas Jones interrupts and tries to steer the conversation back to "let's keep talking about the bullshit".  Ive heard Aaron Russo and David Icke tell him to flat out shut up and stop interrupting.
The strategy is to just keep people talking about how terrible shit is just like AJ does. A conspiracy echo chamber.  JFK had his head blown off in the middle of the street on Live TV and NOTHING HAPPENED.  Movies, thousands of books, declassified documents.... still poppa bush walks free.
           </p>
           <p>
            Singer Marilyn Manson has a spiral heart tatoo on his damn wrist, tell me he knows nothing?
           </p>
           <p>
            Say what you want about David Icke. It he's been 100% about the pedos for 20 years. Entertainers, lawyers, judges, cops, firemen, famous athletes, people who we consider heros.... all involved.
           </p>
           <p>
            We must take this offline guerilla tactics. Magic marker bathroom stalls, bumper stickers on stop signs. I saw a 9/11 inside job graffiti on a hiway sign for one of the busiest roads in the north east. Stayed there for 10 years, dude must be able to levitate. Is this going to be another conspiracy people talk about for 50 years while 10s of millions of kids are raped to death and eaten? Or is this the conspiracy to end all conspiracies. We must all decide now.

             Agreed....This is part of the war for our consciousness folks...the 'final' battle between 'good and 'evil'...and yes it is the 'conspiracy to end all conspiracies'. It's much bigger and more insidious than any of us truly realise. It does infiltrate every aspect of our societies. has done for centuries, millennia...it's not going to crumble overnight. It is happening though...which is why they're so worried. They have never been this close to being 'uncovered' on such a massive, global scale EVER! They better be scared because every single one of theses fuckers has a price to pay for their evilness and wicked ways and it's just a matter of time. Anything can and likely will happen...all we need is another big leak/whistle blower or some people to get conscious....it's already gone past the point of no return, how long it's going to take....years minimum

              Change can come overnight.
Great post, I want to remove my brainwashing time limits for myself. Amazing things happen when millions of good people act out of kindness and well deserved anger.  99% of people on this planet hate kiddy fiddlers. Gang members, prison inmates..... even people we consider the lowest of the low hate rapists and pedos.  We outnumber them by hundreds of millions to one. Change is gonna come and come quick

            I never said pedo rings don't exist, I SAID PIZZAGATE IS A RIDICULOUS FICTITIOUS CONSPIRACY THEORY. The sad thing is that I get this illogical answer all the time. You people are literally insane, your mind is like a balloon filled with with air untied at the end flying all over the place.

             There is no difference. Pizzagate is not consigned to just Alefantis and Comet Pizza. It is a broad spectrum investitgation of ALL pedo rings that we are being made aware of. That's not a conspiracy theory. You are wrong, so go crawl back into your hugbox, autist.

            Exactly, sometimes I think we are it, we are  all these kids have, and every person supressing this info on purpose, is an extremly  horrible human being. I am so fed up with them. The only thing that gives me hope is FBI anon, the good people in government, independent reporters and us.

            That's why we have to focus on the Clinton Foundation because they seem to have made mistakes.  Keep following their ties, listen to George Web on YouTube, etc.

            As to who knows and for how long - years and years and years.  And to create such a network you need government, police, social workers, hospitals and members of the Church to all be involved.

            It largely depends on the mainstream media. So far they have been the biggest cheerleaders for "virtuous" pedophiles, "elite" pedophiles, and so on. Not all the media, obviously, but enough to keep the average muppet doped up on the latest matrix narrative. Once the muppets are told by the mainstream that obvious facts are indeed true, or at least no longer denied so vehemently, the dynamic could change quickly.  Fortunately the exponential growth of leaks is forcing even the most hardcore presstitutes to abandon hopeless narratives at an increasing rate.

            You have to remember the case against them has to be airtight otherwise trying them in court could backfire. They're taking their time is a good thing.

            The only question I have is when are they going to tackle 9/11. I know for me once I saw the evidence against Hillary and Co and was convinced of her guilt my first thought after that was:
           </p>
           <p>
            "Oh shit. If she lied her ass off during the campaign then what else did she lie about."
           </p>
           <p>
            The truth about 9/11 has to come out. It can't be contained anymore.

             I agree,  and in addition to 911, provide us with the truth about the JFK assasination, Sandy  Hook, the Oklahoma City bombimg, the Boston Marathon bombing, the Navy Seals, the assasination of Osama bin Laden, the death of  Princess Dianna...if anybody needs more "events,"  there are more.

             Trump is in bed with too many Israelis for that to happen, IMO.  (I very much hope I'm wrong about that and he releases info anyway.)

            <p>
             Besides, the truth is already out, at least enough of it to know which way the wind blows, but a lot of people just don't want to look at it.  If you do, look up Christopher Bollyn's and Rebekah Roth's work.

              Trump isn't perfect, but I don't see Trump obfuscating something like that.  I agree, he's too friendly with the jews (and I hate that Kushner is having such a pronounced role in the administration) but I think he truly believes in America First.

             9/11 was my red pill, been watching this unfold for 12 odd years, circumstances have both been better and worse for disclosure than now, there is still powerful opposition to even minor discussion at all levels of government. Now consider the people, cognitive dissonance is a hell of a drug. People don't want to believe it was an inside job its too much at once. People are only starting to ask the questions around the full implications of PG opinions are not fully formed.
            </p>
            <p>
             If we could break the back of PG it would show how something like 9/11 could be accomplished with insider foreknowledge, planning and execution and that yes people like this exist and have way too much power. I am ready and able for this to drag out years, I really hope it does not.

              "too much at once."
             </p>
             <p>
              Just the fact Hillary was importing heroin into Chicago is too much at once. It doesn't matter where it starts be it Mango-gate or Haiti-gate or OrganHarvest-gate. Once one thing comes out it'll bring the rest with it. It's one giant monolithic fraud.

            Thank you for writing what I think many of us have been feeling and asking on a daily basis. I know myself each thing you've described and etched out I've asked myself when I wake up: will it happen today? Is today going to be the day?
           </p>
           <p>
            Since I redpilled myself by accident out of bordom 3 months ago ( which now I think was some kind of divine intervention to wake me up) I have gone down may rabbit holes, turned some very dark corners and agonized over whether justice will be served with those of high standing: the law makers, the decision makers, the bankers, the clergy, the underground  "pizza joints"...it's discouraging that it hasn't happened yet.
           </p>
           <p>
            But I think more than seeing justice on these sick sadists that worship evil, I want for the poor innocent children that don't have the emotional, intellectual or spiritual wherewithal to know what is happening or going to happen. Is going to damage their world for the rest of their lives despite how little they endure. The light in their eyes will fade, and the innocence will be stolen from them, forever changing their outlook and futures. This just breaks my heart into a million fucking pieces.
           </p>
           <p>
            I suffer from a lot of anxiety because there is no one in my life that I can talk about this stuff with. I'm living abroad and no one where I am knows of Pizzagate, would even begin to wrap their mind around it, or understand a fraction of its complexities. So I sit by myself and cry, and ask: when? Just like you. Just like so many: when will they deliver what was allegedly promised by this new administration? When wil Mr. Trump and Mr. Sessions take them down like a house of cards?
           </p>
           <p>
            Then I start to ask? Did they even say they would? How do we know they made this promise? Where did we hear this? Maybe this just can't happen? Maybe it's impossible?
           </p>
           <p>
            To take down the whole establishment, the whole elite pedophile institution is a huge undertaking. It would expose world leaders, power players that have complex geopolitical relationships with the US. If one large thread is pulled, who else comes down? Can it be selective? Or do they all come crashing down?
           </p>
           <p>
            I think as dedicated researchers and investigators we are missing some essential and critical pieces to the puzzle. I think it's arrogant and overzealous to say it's happening. Are we seeing some arrests? Yes. Are we seeing some public officials go to prison? Yes. But the ones at the top, the ones we wish to see be taken down have something that is keeping them there. We are making them scared no doubt, with the work here. Clearly we see that because of the actions they are
taking to mitigate our collective voice.  But yes they scared.

            I gues what I'm trying to say is we need to really comprehend the magnitude of what we're dealing with, what our resources are, where our hands are tied, and what pieces are we missing.

             but i thought from the response and the disappointing crowd numbers at the DC rallies that its still even premature for this. Not enough people will understand 'pitchforks pending' until millions more are made aware.

             It can happen - Belgium had a rally of 300 000 in the wake of Dutroux

              I seem to recall a Senator who ran for president who started off with little groups of people and wound up with arenas full.
             </p>
             <p>
              I know it's apples and oranges, but the point is, I think rallies are still important, even if only a couple of people show up to specific events. You don't grow a movement to brainwashed sheeple by expecting them to turn up in droves woke.
             </p>
             <p>
              If you build it, they will come. Let he who is with ears listen. Etc. Etc. Ultimately, we'll wake people up and have the kind of rally we saw in Belgium.
             </p>
             <p>
              That said, I agree that the vigilantism threat thing is too early.

              They said the same about Jimmy Savile and Lawrence E. King Jr. Neither served time for their crimes to children. Mainly because of people like you, who would rather play identity politics than see justice prevail.

            It all comes down to evidence... it needs to be spilled ASAP... we can't proceed, nor can the general public, nor can law enforcement, until the evidence is shared.
           </p>
           <p>
            Weiner's laptop, CPP's private portal, small fish flipping on big fish, etc... all of this needs to be laid out on the table - otherwise, unless people are willing to take George Webb's approach and continue to cross-link his connections w/ PG. Or (more extreme) actually embed themselves into an organization that could eventually result in that person leaking critical intel...
           </p>
           <p>
            We're stuck.
           </p>
           <p>
            We can keep making connections and posting news, and inferring/referencing links to persons of interest - but without actual smoking gun evidence, it's largely a waiting game.
           </p>
           <p>
            The NYPD seems like the "easiest" domino to tip. But, for whatever reason, the sources inside the NYPD are simply not spilling the information from the Weiner/Abedin laptop. Despite having apparently claimed they would if the FBI did not push ahead with prosecutions.
           </p>
           <p>
            It is frustrating... and I'm sure the herd has thinned as a result of these delays, but, my motivation comes from the fact that this was their goal from the beginning. Conceal, wait, disinform, repeat until the buzz dies.
           </p>
           <p>
            If we let it die, than the question "How many more?" becomes very frightening. At least we're doing SOMETHING by keeping this in the light.
