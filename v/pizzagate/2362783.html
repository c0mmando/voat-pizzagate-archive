<p>Anne Coulter is a prominent and best selling advocate for Conservative issues with great influence in Washington. She led with this Pizzagate related quote about Graham while challenging the legitimacy of Lindsey\'s views on immigration.

I\'m not alone here in thinking both of them are members of the sick club. </p>
<p>The brutal and direct language must have worked.  President Trump has excluded Graham from any and all White House meetings on the subject of Immigration. This confirms the weight that Coulter\'s opinions carry with the President, but also reveals how Pizzagate is bubbling just below the surface of nearly every mind in Washington.  
</p>

            Yea... They are much more entertained by the fact that you sound serious about it and you actually believe it that they will hang on longer.  Plus it's more like a hollywood suspense thriller to them.

            Coulter is the Queen of Shock quotes. I think she fancies herself the modern Jonathan Swift. She probably is also a pizzagate denier. I've never heard her mention it before.

            Ann Coulter is, as usual, using red meat to reach a right wing audience, but in reality she may actually be of some help in the cause of stopping sexual abuse of children and sex trafficking . . .
           </p>
           <p>
            but I'd like to know when she became aware of this subject and why is this the first time she's mentioned it in more than a year?
(I also see this comment by "Behind" which may explain it:
            <br/>
            *There used to be a Fox/YouTube clip of her discussing Clinton, Epstein, the Lolita express…and how that story needs to be revisited. I tweeted it several times about a year ago. Eventually though, the clip was removed.")
           </p>
           <p>
            As for red-pilling, I'd be careful that you don't chase people away from the subject, but I do recognize that there were a lot of people who didn't "get" the Washington, DC/Reagan story of young males being brought to the White House at Midnight and the connections to the Franklin case.  Beyond that, if they did understand what it was all about some immediately dropped out on revelations of what was happening to children being trafficked for sex -- or it took them 20 years to get back to the story.
           </p>
           <p>
            *
I'm going to guess that many in media want to cover this story, but they're held back by networks and editors/CEO's.
           </p>
           <p>
            Coulter may have a littler freer hand with this subject?

Warms my heart now that good guys are also hiding truths in plain sight.

             Coulter knows. She should be highlighted in another series of photos ... juxtapositioned with the blindfolded Streep "SHE KNEW".

             Behind --
            </p>
            <p>
             Thanks for that info -- 
Did Coulter ever actually mention "trafficking" ... or higher ups in trafficking.
            </p>
            <p>
             Jeff Sessions has done a lot to break up rings, but no mention of higher ups as yet.
            </p>
            <p>
             Or the military -- as Det. Rothstein in his interview with Fetzer mentions the "little attention given to the military involvement in sex trafficking."  That comes at the very end of the interview.
            </p>
            <p>
             But it seems logical that the many ways found to run drugs would also work for trafficking human beings.

              I believe that Trumps name was on the Lolita flight ONCE.  My take of this is that he was invited with the hopes of entrapping him on video and that he was not aware of the full extent of what was actually happening, BUT, when he found out he was determined from then to expose these sick elites and bring them down.  Just my assumption, but they thought they could ply him with drink or drugs and get the dirt on him, since they have with so many others.  However, he was not into child-rape etc., his OCD was helpful too.  When he SAW what was going on, I think that was when he could not let this go on and his plan to bring them down started.  This is the only thing that makes sense, all these moves to expose the sex trafficking etc., must have taken far longer than the one year he has been in office, this has been planned with high officials for years.  The plan began when he won the election and signed the Sex Trafficking Executive Order, which was almost the first one signed by him.  This enabled authorities to cut off the money trails and have these sickos account for their atrocities.  Times are getting exciting!!!.....popcorn time!

              Not sure, but Trump kicked Epstein out of his resort.  I am thinking that if Trump did anything, then it would be on video.
