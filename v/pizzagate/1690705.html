            Even if some of the claims about DS were true, the idea that he alone could destroy all PG credibility is laughable. The question is, who gets to define his credibility? So far, it's a minority of posters at VOAT who regularly pepper the board with vitriolic. The majority have a right to play as a team without being inundated with the fatiguing distraction of DS bashing, to elicit the desired outcome, which is arrests. No one seriously interested in seeing arrests would devote even a fraction of the effort to discredit him as seen by people like you, so I am speaking on behalf of many VOAT members when I say we have no other logical choice but to conclude you and a fair number of the others are in fact disinformation operatives, cleverly disguised mind you, but operatives nonetheless. If Podesta and company operated with even a fraction of the disloyalty of the DSBG (David Seaman Bashing Group) did, they'd all be in prison right now. This sentence is as immutable as the gravity Seaman jokingly described arguing against if it would net him media attention.
           </p>
           <p>
            There is nothing that can destroy the truth. When Seaman says Pizzagate is real, he speaks the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth.
           </p>
           <p>
            I have one last bit of interesting news. Because of the ferocious and unrelenting attacks directed toward DS, I am compiling a database of all repeat DS bashers, and cataloging all their VOAT contributions with the intent to forensically analyze the value of their content contributed to PG at VOAT.

            HAHAHA! The paid shills are like cockroaches around here. Relentless posts picking at David Seaman. Sorry, too little, too late. You should have tried harder BEFORE he got the word out. He has been EXTREMELY SUCCESSFUL AND EFFECTIVE in bringing pizzagate to the attention of the masses....whether some like his style or not. The constant attacks have backfired....as they simply have helped to convince everyone that (to quote David Seaman) PIZZAGATE IS REAL! Go crawl back under your rocks.

            <p>
             Calling other people shills nice try. Fuck me. No one hear ever said pizzagate wasnt real or anything of the type. more misdirection. It is what he shills and how he acts. That is the issue with this zionist shilling clown. If you cant accept that well too fucking bad. A shill is a shill is a shill.

            1) She thinks he's too unemotional.
2) He edits his videos.
3) He reads notes.

             Sure, spend 20 minutes watching a seaman video of him reading general cliff notes of other researcher's work while he doesn't give them credit. But 4 minutes watching an expert analyze his body language to determine his authenticity ? "waste of time"

             To play devils advocate, literally, let's assume Seaman's a fraud. How does it hurt to have a fraud working to expose PG? The only entities that benefit from destroying him are his adversaries. Who are his main adversaries for the last three months?

              Disinformation. Gatekeeping. What Alex Jones does. Yes it's good hes spreading the general word about PG, but when he spreads false information that people later find out isn't true, it makes the conspiracy seem unsubstantiated and crazy. That goes for the researchers as well. Yea... in the end it doesn't matter. But short term we need enough people on our side to eventually cause a tipping point. This hinders the investigation short term.

               Let's assume he gets a few details wrong. If you think that he's the only one, you are mistaken. If you think that  the odd mistake diminishes his role as a face and name to the media campaign that is desperately needed, you are mistaken. You are no battlefield tactician. You and your ilk are in fact saboteurs, and everyone who is really interested in justice can smell you a mile away.

                im outing an obvious fraud and IM the saboteur? im the shill ? Right. Apparently you do not understand how the sheep work. Like i said, they will look to a spokesmen and when he turns out to be false , they will be off put by this. This is why they are propping him up, to be a gatekeeper.

              I agree, the more attention he gets the worse it is for us. But i dont post shit about him, if your read my comment history you will see i tell people to not even bring his name up and ignore him. But this is different. This is outing him as a fraud for the Seaman fanboys here who can't seem to believe hes more against us than with us.
