<p>When I invited Isaac to my home, I did so with informed consent. Many warned me not to, that he was part of an elaborate trap – which he unwittingly was. However, I felt compelled to do so. The Isaac I got to know over 2 months was not the person we saw on the internet. That was in part the actor, the pretender. The person my family, friends and I were impacted with was an intensely damaged, drug-addicted, moody, tantrum-throwing, attention-seeking pain in the arse whose emotional maturity appeared to have been stunted at about age 10 years. Many a time I was tempted to throw Isaac out – or throttle him. But my family would calm me and advise, “Just be kind. He’s here for a short time. You never know what he’s going home to. We have the opportunity to show him God’s love.”</p>
<p>It is evident from Isaac’s last words that he accepted Jesus into his heart just before he died. That fact has caused me more emotion and tears than his death because I thought I had failed in that department. I recall one time at the dinner table when Isaac seemed genuinely open to hearing about Jesus Christ. “Oh yeah, I’ve heard of Him. He’s a good guy, right?” he said innocently. But I was too angry at him at that moment to patiently and thoroughly share the Gospel with Isaac, and I was short with him. I regret that. I should have just left it to my husband to do what he does best and explain salvation to Isaac. So, when I received the barrage of early morning texts yesterday, informing me Isaac had “committed suicide,” I grieved for the lost opportunity to lead him to salvation.</p>
<p>But Isaac did not commit suicide. It is clear from the growing body of testimony that Isaac was murdered in the USA child trafficking capital of Arizona by opportunists who seized his last testimony as grounds for another ‘two bullets to the back of the head’ scenario. Was he thrown off the overpass? Was he ever there at all? Did military thugs shoot out his tyre and drag him to their nearby base for a dose of Seligman’s torture techniques?</p>
<p>Isaac did not go to Hell as I feared. A friend told me that Isaac’s salvation did not rely on that one lost opportunity, and that it was how I conducted myself daily that provided the main testimony. She is right. Isaac observed my family for the best part of two months. He was there when we said grace before dinner and gave thanks for him too. He got to observe my mother during a lengthy naturopathic consultation with her. He was there for my daughter’s ballet concert. I remember the look of genuine delight on Isaac’s face as he watched a stage full of young children stumble their way through their steps. And then at half time, he broke down crying outside, telling me how lucky I was to have a family, and how he didn’t want to be “a patsy.”</p>
<p>It seems I did not fail after all. It seems my family and I laid the seeds which others watered, others like the Christian who apparently conversed with Isaac as he was stranded on the side of a remote road, just before the pedo network seized him. I take comfort in testimonies like that.</p>
<p>The public have been left with conflicting images of who and what the real Isaac Kappy was. Some label him a Psy-Op, a DID MK-ULTRA plant, a patsy, a LARP, a fake, a bad actor, a user, a drugged hippie. Others hail him as a hero, a genuine whistle-blower against Hollywood pedophilia, a talented musician, an intelligent comedian. Isaac was all those things and more. He was easy to love, and easy to hate all at the one time.</p>
<p>But in the end, love won out. It’s so easy to judge, when ultimately no-one but Isaac and God knew what spiritual and physical demons he was battling. I always believed Isaac was DID, a victim like me, and that is where my compassion stemmed from. If only I had been a little more patient, a little kinder, I lament. I wish I could have had one more conversation with him or been able to see him in person again – after his conversion to Christianity. Isaac was the youngest of Christians when he delivered the most profound, wise, and mature Christian testimony in his final hours. His final words constitute Isaac Kappy’s greatest legacy. In that moment, God wiped his slate clean and accepted him into everlasting Paradise. And I look forward to the day I see him again, there in Heaven. Praise the Lord for that.</p>
<p>My sincerest condolences to Isaac’s family at this painful time.</p>
<p>Love, Fiona</p>

            Whatever Kappy was or wasn't, it's rather shitty to write the above, and end the text with expressing sympathies for his family. Hypocrite.
           </p>
           <p>
            If she got tired of him, she should have politely asked him to leave. Bitching about him on the internet after his alleged death like this is ....well, shitty.
           </p>
           <p>
            Also - why is she pushing the 'he was murdered' narrative.
           </p>
           <p>
            We do not know what has really been going on, several scenarios are possible.
           </p>
           <p>
            The murder narrative might be used in order to silence whistleblowers.

             I agree with your comment 100%.  At this point, there are so many lies within lies, and disinfo agents mixed among actual truth seekers that it's hard to believe anything or anyone at all which only makes the poor children's suffering even more devastating.

             Yeah, I agree, sorry Fiona if yo are reading this but that was kinda messed up.Like I said earlier in a comment, it is ALL very confusing and I never understood all the in fighting and back stabbing. Maybe he was a pain in the ass so ask him to wash his hands before dinner or go live somewhere else.  Leave. Glad I tend to keep my distance. My last communication with Fiona was asking her to watch my feature film. Never got a response, guess she was too busy but my film and elements in it directly relate to what she has been exposing. I honestly and earnestly thought she could get something out of it. I like Fiona but again, so friggin confusing, all of it. I don't have an agenda or a big youtube channel or any of that. I hope I am like others on here, just trying to remain somewhat neutral and not cherry picking info that fits my opinions. It is tough, but I do see it with some others on here, trying to remain unbiased and using critical thinking. That is what this whole sage concerning Kappy is tough. There are no answers, not even an answer about what terrible thing he did prior to his last periscope.

             I agree, why attack a dead man? He might have been murdered or might not but Fiona still should have boundaries. You are right think the narrative very well could be.

            <p>
             Yep. Remember after he left her place she came out and attacked him and accused a couple of his friends of being satanic pedophiles. She ignored him when he reached out and was trying to figure out why she was doing that. He didn't even publicly address until a couple weeks later giving her time to clear the air about it and she chose not to. At that point he did publicly address it and called her a liar. He didn't think that she was a bad actor but he did think she was a liar. I think she was too. Otherwise she would have defended her claims against that document that exposed her falsehoods instead of deleting all her social media.

            </blockquote>
            <p>
             Because it benefits her. Just like Jason Boss. Just like that Eliah Priest guy. He's pushing a story that Kappy made one final broadcast on instagram that implies that Donald Trump ordered Kappy killed, heh. Just like pretty much everyone else that enjoys the spotlight and strives to be an influencer on the subject in general.

            <p>
             That's a really good point. Personally, I think he killed himself. It was pretty obvious to me that he was wavering on that decision during his final periscope broadcast. I'm not basing my opinion on what all these other people are saying. I'm basing it on what I knew of him which, I wager, is more than most people on here.

            Since 2016 the alternative/online media has been infiltrated by dozens of Jewish controlled opposition agents, Kappy was just another one in this theater of delusion, and until we see hard factual evidence that he's actually dead we have to assume that his entire shtick was a staged operation, with a very predictable message: look what happens to elite pedo whistleblowers. Kappy wasn't suicidal, and the claims made in the Instagram note come across as fake, insincere and overblown - it reads like the author clearly doesn't believe a single word they are saing. In reality, Kappy's so-called last words sound like they were dictated by Hollywood's cabal of protected pedo elites - the note was really just a barely concealed confession that he's been making false accusations of pedophilia against his big name friends and aquaintances in Hollywood. So ithe note was perfectly scripted by Kappy's pedo elite handler's, and just to keep everyone guessing it was dated in the future while never ininuating that he wanted to die anyway, a signature mark of intelligence agency obfuscation. Another day another a psy-op in the deep state's war on reality.
           </p>
           <p>
            Facts are relevant here. Does anyone want to take a guess as to what all these alleged elite pedophiles and sexual predators have in common? 
Harvey Weinstein
Kevin Spacey
Steven Speilberg
Bryan Singer
Seth Green 
James Gunn
Jimmy Savile 
Roman Polanski
Woody Allen
Gary Glitter
David Keyes (Netanyahu’s foreign media spokesman) 
Jeffrey Epstein’s (Lolita Express)
           </p>
           <p>
            At the peak of the Harvey Weinstein scandal, genius Jewish comedian Larry David publicly shared his concerns about a very disturbing pattern that's emerging, when he bravely admitted that - not all - but many of these predators accused of sexual harassment (and worse) are Jews. And if you say this out loud it's immediately called hate speech and you'll never have a public platform in mainstream Western society ever again.
           </p>
           <p>
            And that means we're all blind to whats really going on here, we're missing the point of the whole Kappy phenomenon. Many - not all - of these predators accused of sexual harassment, rape and pedophiliia in Hollywood are Jews. That's the truth, and it means that Kappy was a Jewish cointelpro agent: his entire operation was about building trust to draw you in, so that he could then lead you all away in the opposite direction by making the whole movement look retarded. Mission accomplished.

            Fiona had called me at home and asked if I would help get her statement out. I posted it on a blog I had(since shut down) and a friend gave it to this Kappy guy. I never was acknowledged for posting her statement, that's okay. However Kappy really ran with it and then became friends with Fiona. She had also invited me to visit her in Australia but no, I never went. What I found alarming is that Kappy was somehow endorsed by the truther community as the savior of SRA victims inspite of many survivors coming out and trying to get people to listen.Why was Kappy promoted?

             Hey 21 nice to see you posting again. Been thinking of you when I heard about the Frank Guistra lawsuit lol!! What a joke. Have you had any backlash from this? Any news on this deceptive creep? Take care and your film sounds interesting. Totally agree with your thoughts on Kappy. I’d say the Troma Trauma films cult pushed him into the spotlight then took him out but who really knows at this point. Doubt it was suicide murder much more plausible.

              Thanks a lot!! Yes, I really think you of all people would totally get my film! It has received just unreal great reviews that have even surprised me. Of course due to my blacklist don't expect to see it on Netflix but most that watch it def. think it should be on there. Here is a link. It costs 3.99 to rent, hope that is okay but it is my only way to recoup the money I spent on it as I completely financed it myself (well with a bit of help from my girlfriend as well).

              As for Kappy I really don't know what to make of his 'death'. Part of me thinks it is not what it appears to be. His being so promoted as a savior for SRA victims was always strange.Jason Goodman and that Nathan guy from 'Lift The Veil' I have never trusted. I actually despise both of these creeps

            Sorry. Fiona is a fraud, disinfo asset.
           </p>
           <p>
            I believe not one word coming out of her mouth. This bonding with another person that was clearly disinfo proves it. No way was Kappy anything than an asset. He was aligned with Sanders. That should tell you everything you need to know. That along with there was never one iota of proof of anything produced. And, yet, he wanted PedoWood victims to contact him so he could hide them?
           </p>

            A gigantic ploy and one designed to take advantage of the weak and vulnerable. Fiona lied before about her allegiance to Kappy and she's doing it again.

            I cannot wait for the truth to come out so I don't have to listen to anymore BS again.

            What the actual hell?  No God fearing Christian would ever presume to know the final status of another person's soul in the afterlife, especially a poor Christian soul who may have committed suicide. This is an incredibly evil thing to assert, because it leads to complacence. Believers ought to be praying for this dude, not presuming he needs no prayers.

             Do you not know that you are God's temple and that God's Spirit dwells in you? If anyone destroys God's temple, God will destroy him. For God's temple is holy, and you are that temple.
