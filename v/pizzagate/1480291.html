<p>On Wednesday, April 29th, the Clintons\' charter plane made an unscheduled landing at an unspecified fueling station in Dodoma (the capital of Tanzania). Here\'s a list of fueling stations in Tanzania: <a href="http://144.76.33.232/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/List-of-Licensed-Petrol-Stations-in-Tanzania-as-of-August-2014.pdf">http://144.76.33.232/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/List-of-Licensed-Petrol-Stations-in-Tanzania-as-of-August-2014.pdf</a>. </p>
<p>Supposedly, while the group was &quot;traveling from Iranga, a city in the center of Tanzania, to Lake Manyara, which is in the north,&quot; the plane had engine problems and had to land. CBS News reported that the problem was fixed in less than 45 minutes (<a href="http://archive.is/Ckc9i">http://archive.is/Ckc9i);</a>;) ABC News (<a href="https://archive.is/yevXX">https://archive.is/yevXX)</a>) reported that Secret Service agents said the plane landed around 10 a.m. ET, and was back in the air around 11:23 a.m. ET. An aide told NBC News (<a href="https://archive.is/D3g98">https://archive.is/D3g98)</a>) that the pilot followed proper protocol in deciding to land, but could have completed the trip using the other three engines.</p>
<p>It would be interesting to find out which fueling station the plane stopped at, and what else is located in that area. Orphanages, refugee camps, etc. Originally, the group was going to borrow Frank Giustra\'s plane, but cancelled those plans because of controversy over Giustra\'s ties to Russia. Instead, they used another plane, but did not disclose who owned the plane.</p>
<p>The Clinton Global Initiative also cancelled a planned meeting in Athens, which had received $1 million in funding from former Greek parliamentarian Gianna Angelopoulos, the wife of <strong>billionaire shipping and steel magnate Theodore Angelopoulos</strong>. Gianna had also donated as much as $10 million for the CGI meeting in New York in September. <a href="http://archive.is/1g8yv">http://archive.is/1g8yv</a> This article also mentions that the Swedish and Dutch lotteries allocate part of ticket buyers’ purchases to charities, including the Clinton Foundation. </p>
<p>According to this Politico article (<a href="https://archive.is/W1b6r">https://archive.is/W1b6r)</a>), the grand finale of the Africa trip was a lavish CGI meeting in Marrakech, which was funded to the tune of at least $1 million from the Moroccan state-owned <strong>phosphate exporter</strong> OCP (formerly called the Office Chérifien des Phosphates).One of OCP\'s stated goals is to export more phosphate to other African countries for crop production. (They would use shipping containers for that.)</p>
<p>&quot;The company was connected with the Clinton Foundation by longtime Clinton supporter Stuart Eizenstat, a senior counsel at the powerhouse law firm Covington &amp; Burling LLP, which represents OCP in Washington....</p>
<p>&quot;During Clinton’s State Department years, OCP... paid a Covington team led by Eizenstat $760,000 to lobby Congress and federal agencies – including the State Department – according to Senate lobbying filings....&quot;</p>
<p>Lobbying report: <a href="http://archive.is/Hd52H">http://archive.is/Hd52H</a></p>
<p>&quot;The filings don’t identify specific issues on which Eizenstat’s team lobbied, instead indicating a general mission of \'Promoting economic integration in the Maghreb and enhanced economic relations between the Maghreb and the United States.\' The Maghreb is the region of Northwest Africa that is home to Morocco and neighboring countries.&quot;</p>
<p>It might be a good idea to dig more deeply into Timber Lake Camp, the Angelopouloses, and OCP, as well as finding out where exactly that plane stopped, who owned the plane, and what kind of lobbying Eizenstat was doing for OCP.</p>',
