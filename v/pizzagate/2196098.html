            Yes, Piers is right on this one.  Also thank you for sharing that term.  There is also what lawyers call something like a strawman legal case, but it's what the Clinton's do in court.  They take a smaller or more easiliy debunkable case to distract or diffuse the issue.  This Weinstein case is just like the Monica Lewinsky case as an example.  Pres. Clinton had bigger and much more serious allegations however Monica took over the press and it swamped out the serious cases.   They are masters at this very thing and probably played a role.

            Rich coming from a guy like Morgan who’s from the U.K., loaded with Pedo Elites including the Royals. Wonder if he ever reported about that back in the day? Something about this whole “disclosure” on Hollyweird smells. The timing is suspicious especially with the Las Vegas shooting seeming to now take a back seat.

             I agree, it's all a distraction.  There's no point getting our hopes up; this is not to do with pedophilia in Hollywood, as that shit will never get mentioned.  It's not even a step in the right direction, just a guy getting thrown to the wolves by the elite.

              BINGO! Even this latest “Assange” shit coming up, some anon, FBI anon, or whatever said something to the effect not to expect a pizza related dump.  Even all that stuff looks like another Elite/CIA cooked up false flag too, it appears we will never get 100% or justice for the kids. It’s all bullshit, it’s all a game to them and I feel like we keep spinning our wheels.

               A year ago when this started,  I was so sure that it would all come out.  I was waiting for the day I would see something about it on the news.  Podesta arrested. Or something, anything.  Every few months since then there's "hope" in the form of a 4chan anon, a cryptic tweet or Trump saying something vaguely threatening.  And I've realised it will not EVER come to anything, they own every angle, they have an answer and a solution and a story and a distraction for everything.  I urge people to stop putting their hope into this.  Just keep researching and doing your best.  Don't listen to celebrities and their tweets.   It means nothing.

                You’re so right.  I always think of this song a lot lately.  Everything is a frickin stage filled with actors.  There maybe a few that are “real”, but for the most part, everything is an illusion for confusion.

                He and his sister are playing prominent roles in the real agenda that leads to Global Enslavement from Cradle to Grave (his organization calls it Cradle to Career to be more acceptable).

               <p>
                They are using his organization to create new global education models in Racine linked with such corporate partners as SC Johnson, Cargill, Amazon, and Foxconn. This is all part of the great deception of Sustainability (Satan's Ability) through such groups as Pilgrims Society.

                 Yes -- saw the Clinton &amp; dem party ties on his wiki. And I saw that the former mayor also worked for Aspin, gonna look more into him tomorrow. Don't know how to begin looking into the organizations you mentioned -- even the public ones -- although their boards is a start. Would be great if we could form small tactical teams here to gather and organize information. Also noted either Johnson's or the Chamber org is "helpfully" providing information on mayoral candidates.
                </p>
                <p>
                 Also yes -- shuddered at the Cradle to Career bit on his organization's website. Couldn't find traction on sister Bauer van Whatshername, though I only did a quick pass.
                </p>
                <p>
                 Any idea whyTF Racine? O yeah -- there were those other things you mentioned this morning -- weird landmarks and stuff. Way weird. More research ahead.
                </p>
                <p>
                 Also - you called out Assange, Snowden, etc for withholding information, yet you know much more than you're telling. What makes you different from them? No offense :)

                  The main area business association is called RAMAC (there is also a sister chamber of commerrce in Kenosha and some other partnership groups involved).
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  The past mayors were criminals, part of the secret societies and service organizations involved, and at least one was proven to be a pedophile. Trafficking, corruption and pedo crimes are commonly known problems in the Racine area. The most recent mayor, DA, City Attorney, police chief and City Administrator all resigned amid RICO and other allegations that Comey and Lynch personally obstructed.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  The difference is we never worked for the CIA or NSA, we are not hackers, we were not raised in a cult, and we are not compromised in any way or have any motive to make any deals.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  We learned the real Truth through a very unique and profound set of circumstances. We have witnessed their methods, discovered their connections, and found out their real agenda which is shocking and disturbing yet completely true - Global Enslavement through the deception of Sustainability (Satan's Ability) and the Mark of the Beast enforced by Community Policing and AI (partnering with Microsoft, Amazon, Google, Facebook, Foxconn, HTC, IBM,, Tesla, Samsung, etc.).
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  The world needs to know the Truth before it is too late and before more lives are destroyed. Our life means nothing if we cannot Save others.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  Also before we realized the importance of what we knew, they tried to murder one of us many years ago and murdered the wrong person. By they we mean the CIA and the Dixie Mafia, tied to the Clintons and others involved. We found they are part of a bigger network, and it is time for the world to find out exactly who is in that network and what they are planning.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  We welcome any help to shine the light on the Trutb and the "root" of the world's cancer - Racine, Wisconsin.

                   Thank you for your explanation of the difference. Was just reading through your comment history -- finished page 2.

                   I can only imagine your learning experience must have been a very unique and profound set of circumstances, indeed. Thank you, beyond words, for your commitment to Truth. Lorna Byrne is an Irish woman who has seen and communicated with angels since birth, in addition to having many, many other profound experiences. She, too, has written of the dark, enslaved future that awaits humanity if we do not awaken and correct course. She says, also, that there are many beautiful futures, all weaving together, if/when we
                   <em>
                    remember
                   </em>
                   Whose children we are, and Save each other.

                  <p>
                   The Great Lakes Council website stated that Dickert retired or resigned from his position as Racine's mayor to take the GLC position. Lies, lies, and more lies. Everywhere. Thank you, again, for your commitment to Truth -- reading your comments is water in the desert. I will help shine whatever light I can on the Truth, and the "root" - Racine, Wisconsin.

                     Read through many of your past comments today. Starting to look into some of the links you provided, check out organizations you've mentioned. Remembered a site I'd come across last year -- Institute for the Study of Covert Politics and Globalization -- and wondered if you had found it helpful/truthful. I don't see you mentioning it -- at least not in the last four months.

                      Yes we are very familiar with the ISGP site, and it has a wealth of valuable information. We tend not to include links to avoid perceptions of bias or without vetifying everything they link to, as we use an open multi source approach focused on only the information that matches up with what we already know to be true. It continues ro expand daily. Everything on this site leads to the same "root" in Racine, Wisconsin.

                       Thank you for this. And I get that you're all human like the rest of us, but the intelligence with which you are proceeding is rather astonishing, and very inspiring. Thank you again. I hope we get to the point soon where you might launch the 'something larger' you've mentioned repeatedly.

                  899 informed and deeply informative comments over 8 months can hardly be considered "withholding" I realize -- and yet... it just seems you have enough info to
