            "Cheesebay" sells "faulty Hard drives" on eBay. All the reviews are GLOWING in ways that are bizarre gizen that he's self-reportedly selling "junk". Compound in Hawaii has vats/barrels with what looks like the remain of rendering processes (dissolving tissues). There's waek wifi signals coming from underneath the shed that indicate there's something underneath it. "Bif Skipman" runs the business at that address. It's an alias, of an alias, of an alias

            She works for the Clinton Foundation. The e-mail is possibly from the Music booker at Comet Ping Pong pizza.

            The pizza place owned by the former gay boyfriend of David Brock, the CEO of Correct The Record and the venue for dozens of events for the Hillary campaign staff.

            Chris Kirchhoff joins DIUx as a partner from the National Security Council, where he served as a lead technology strategist and lead author of the White House’s big data report. Vishaal Hariprasad is the director of threat intelligence at Palo Alto Networks, and is also an Air Force reservist with previous ties to Shah.
           </p>
           <p>
            Carter plans to further strengthen ties with the private sector by forming a first-of-its-kind DIUx reserve unit under the direction of Douglas Beck, a Navy Reserve Commander who currently serves as a vice president at Apple and reports directly to Apple CEO Tim Cook. Reservists will work in the technology industry when not serving in uniform.

            To run this new venture, Secretary Carter announced a “partnership-style” leadership team. The team will include Christopher Kirchhoff, a DOD employee currently detailed to the National Security Council (NSC). Chris has been serving as NSC Director for Strategic Planning, and he will be leaving the NSC to return to DOD.
