            Yes this is correct the Vatican has its on laws (cannon law) and the Pope is the ultimate judge. The Vatican also is a state unto itself and can issue diplomatic immunity, passports, banking, etc.
           </p>
           <p>
            One of the driving forces that led to the founding of the United States was to break away from the Vatican. The separation powers of church and state are to protect against the Vatican and prevent the Pope from having any authority here in the US. He does not or is not supposed to. All US citizens whether priest or parishner are treated equal under the law the Pope can not get involved. That is what the law is although what actually happens as we know is profoundly different.
           </p>
           <p>
            That is why it was shocking and very revealing when Obama had the first Jesuit Pope come to the US and then speak to congress. Unbelievable.
           </p>
           <p>
            The other five eye nations are common wealths and still under the crown which is under the Pope. That is why their leaders are all prime ministers instead of Presidents. Such as Canada, New Zealand, Australia, GB. Their leaders always pledge an oath to the queen and the Vatican maintains power in their country.
           </p>
           <p>
            This is a reason after WW11 the CIA went underground and entered the US through Operation Paperclip. The CIA stands for Catholics In Action they were and are the Jesuits of the Vatican. There is no way American citizens would agree to this back in that day. Being Catholic in the US was not highly regarded and looked at suspiciously due to historical events of the Vatican.
           </p>
           <p>
            So in the end they came through black budgets and dark money and even the congress does not know what they do.

             The Catholic Church has it's own judicial system, which was the foundation for the European system (it's about 1000 years older). From Wikipedia:
            </p>
            <blockquote>
             <p>
              The Catholic Church has what is claimed to be the oldest continuously functioning internal legal system in Western Europe,[9] much later than Roman law but predating the evolution of modern European civil law traditions. What began with rules ("canons") adopted by the Apostles at the Council of Jerusalem in the first century has developed into a highly complex legal system encapsulating not just norms of the New Testament, but some elements of the Hebrew (Old Testament), Roman, Visigothic, Saxon, and Celtic legal traditions.
             </p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>
             Archdiocese are bound by their bishop to report crimes that break secular law to secular authorities. The buck stops (or doesn't if they're corrupt) with the bishops, who are all pretty much equals (in authority, not in political power and influence) and responsible for their diocese.
            </p>
            <blockquote>
             <p>
              So the church is the one that is in control of the punishments right?
             </p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>
             Depends. The Church can do little to "punish" a lay person, and it's all spiritual. More can be done to priests -- including losing their pension and livelihood. However, the Church is bound by the teachings of Christ, who required mercy and forgiveness of sins for the repentant, and by canon laws such as the seal of the Confessional, under which a priest may not disclose to ANYONE under pain of excommunication anything told him during the Sacrament of Reconciliation. They cannot report crimes confessed during the sacrament to the police or anyone else, nor can they be compelled to testify in secular court about what they may have heard. All they can do is require the person to self-report before they give them absolution (forgiveness of sins).

              That's just wrong to me. I've seen them just get probation or something. For molestation! They should go to prison like anyone else. If a Christian pastor molested someone, he would have to go thru our Criminal Justice System.
             </p>
             <p>
              I believe in mercy and forgiveness. But, we should still have to suffer the consequences of what we've done. Maybe that's why there are so many pedophiles in the Catholic Church.
