<p>On Monday, November 4, 2019, the Polk County Sheriff’s Office concluded a month-long special operation to identify members of the community who possessed and shared child pornography. The operation, called “Guardians of Innocence IV: Fall Haul,” was carried out by undercover detectives from PCSO’s Computer Crimes Unit, and resulted in the arrests of 17 people (16 of whom live in Polk county).</p>
<p>During the operation, one man was caught as he was attempting to meet a Frostproof child for sexual favors, two men were pursuing nude pictures from two different 13-year-old girls using Snapchat and Facebook, and another who admitted that if he didn’t look at child pornography, he would sexually batter children. </p>
<p>“The people arrested during this operation prey on the most innocent and vulnerable among us---our children.

            Sorry to hijack thread. I have no points to post a big boy thread myself.
           </p>
           <p>
            Just saw a short movie. First image on the screen was the word Arcanum and the boy lover pedo symbol. The movie was about summoning demons, not my usual genre.
           </p>
           <p>
            Check out their website. Pedo symbol on front page ffs.

            <p>
             Fla. child sex sting nets suspects from Disney and SeaWorld, plus a Christian football coach
            </p>
            <p>
             They called the operation “April’s Fools,” and not just because it took place during the first week of the month.
            </p>
            <p>
             The Polk County Sheriff Office’s latest sting operation — in which undercover detectives lured suspected child predators to an undisclosed Florida location using fictitious online ads — was a not-so-subtle reference to the 18 men police netted.
            </p>
            <p>
             They were young and old, ranging in age from 19 to 60. Some had lengthy criminal histories, and others were encountering the criminal justice system for the first time.
            </p>
            <p>
             Five of the men told police they were married, and one had a newborn baby back home. Most were from the area, but one man who showed up at a Cracker Barrel to have sex with a 13-year-old boy — his wallet packed with cocaine and a hallucinogen — was in town from Alaska.
            </p>
            <p>
             They included men who would otherwise blend in: A mechanic, an airline customer service manager, a hospital technician, a former firefighter, a football coach at a Christian academy, an employee at a Sea World theme park and another at Walt Disney World who allegedly told a detective posing as a 14-year-old girl that he wanted to do “everything” sexual to her.

             I had the same experience. If it were not for the evil I have seen, I may not have been driven to discover the truth. I still struggle to believe what I am reading, the scale of this scourge, is simply mind blowing for someone with any sort of moral compass. For those of us who are not skewed by trauma or perversion, the natural reaction is to begin to question everything. I am glad there can be some faith found amidst the questions. This truly is spiritual warfare.

              Rereading the new testament, it's amazing to me how pertinent Jesus was to the struggles we still face: harming children, pharisees perverting morality, and the money changers.
