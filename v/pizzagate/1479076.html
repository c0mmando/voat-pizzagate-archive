             https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/52312)
            </a>
            ) (please tell me how to get that to come up as an active hyperlink on this page...sorry, not tech savvy)
           </p>
           <p>
            This is the entire content of the email: referral program
            <a href="http://santanayachts.com/imagenesian54/SaleGraciniaCambogia.php">
             http://santanayachts.com/imagenesian54/SaleGraciniaCambogia.php
            </a>
            A couple of items that I thought were interesting about the above email:
1) The subject line looked like this: "re(9); 10" which seems obscure
2) The very first email account on the "To" line was "
            <a class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="6d3d021d085859592d0e02000e0c1e1943030819" href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection">
             [email protected]
            </a>
            ", both because of the "Pope" part and because it's a Comcast email address - if this is nefarious, someone at Comcast is directly involved
3) Santana Yachts seems to change the word "Garcinia" of "Garcinia Cambogia" the weight loss supplement by one letter shift to "Gracinia" - Is this a way to call attention to the type of vessel you'll find on their website with the same name...that is either used or sold for trafficking purposes?
4) There were images attached to this email of a very nice yacht...why? If it's really a referral program, wouldn't you also rave about your own yacht to "sell it" in the email?
           </p>
           <p>
            I found another email on from Wendy Abrams on Wikileaks: (
            <a href="https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/46110">
             https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/46110)
            </a>
            ) and it's strange for the following reasons:
           </p>
           <p>
            1) It has a VERY STRANGE subject line: "This Kit Changed All My Life" 
2) The text in the email says: "Just take a chance to meet someone very special for nice chats or more!
            <a href="http://www.lideresendeportes.com.ar/www.foxnews.cash.for.reallife1.p">
             http://www.lideresendeportes.com.ar/www.foxnews.cash.for.reallife1.p
            </a>
            hp?ygpage=3oefx "
           </p>
           <p>
            1) Lideres  En deports  - will get you too the football league
2) what's up with fox news being on this link?
3) what's up with the "cash for reallife" portion of this link?
           </p>
           <p>
            Folks - THIS IS A LINK TO A SPANISH SPEAKING FOOTBALL (SOCCER) CLUB!!! A FRONT FOR WHAT - A GAY DATING SITE? WHAT ELSE IS GOING ON, IS IT A PLACE TO MEET CHILDREN???
           </p>
           <p>
            I think everyone reading this is probably aware that a pedophile scandal is unraveling in the UK:
            <a href="http://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2016/12/02/504164498/pedophilia-scandal-sends-shock-waves-through-u-k-soccer">
             Pedophilia Scandal Sends Shock Waves Through U.K. Soccer
            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            Also, folks - please forgive my lack of tech savvy, but I have been reading and watching this play out long enough to make some connections - Remember the picture of the guy with a shirt that said "J'aime les enfants" in French which translates to "I love children"? He had two guys standing on either side of him in football (soccer) shorts, which some readers determined to be from a specific football club in Australia, I think. Anyway, I believe this thread previously was on Voat...and IT, along with the bust in England, and the Spanish speaking weird email make me think that SOCCER CLUBS ALL OVER THE GLOBE are being used as fronts for pedophiles and gay men dating sites (not worried about gay men using sites, as long as they are not violating children.)
           </p>
           <p>
            And finally, the third email from Wendy Abrams that I found to be highly suspicious is this one: (
            <a href="https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/26288">
             https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/26288)
            </a>
            )
1) The Subject line is fairly simple and contains the number "9" again with no words, just like the first email in this Comment post
2) The content of the email is merely a link:
            <a href="http://sambaquisustentavel.com.br/_reports1.html_?579=tjsoz&amp;4311&amp;imenjma==13979437">
             http://sambaquisustentavel.com.br/_reports1.html_?579=tjsoz&amp;4311&amp;imenjma==13979437
            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            I looked up Sambaqui - it looks to be a coastal city in Brazil (Sambaquis also apparently is used to describe the "shell mounds" found along the coast of Brazil)
Sustental - Sustainability
So - it occurred to me - is CGI using their Sustainability Goals as a front to exploit these coast cities where it would be remarkably easy to grab a kid or a few every time they come in to do work there? I still have more work to do on this...but it's a start, I think.
           </p>
           <p>
            Edit (1) - I meant to include that it looks like Santana Yachts operates internationally, but I have not done enough research to identify where, specifically. It may be of interest to get a better idea where they operate if we identify a "hotspot" so to speak.

            A friend of mine works in customs doing import inspection.
           </p>
           <p>
            She said that if you have suspicions, you should go to the Federal Fish and Wildlife Anonymous tip site and submit a tip.
If they suspect wildlife trafficking, they will turn the ship upsidedown and open every single container looking for ivory or rhino horn.
           </p>
           <p>
            They have search dogs that sniff the containers for contraband.
           </p>
           <p>
            It's a good way for something to "accidentally" turn up.

            Vessel finder is up, but unsure how we'll know what's in those containers, and if anyone will do anything. I like your thoughts on this. A few questions: once the vessels are on the water, isn't it a different set of laws - maritime? Who enforces those laws? Is it Coast Guard for us? Who would it be for the other countries/ports mentioned? I will assist as needed, not tech savvy but can brainstorm with the best of 'em.

             I know this is focused on cruise ships, which may also be used for child trafficking, but if helps give you an idea about international water rules (seemingly none)

            OK... Anchorage occurs when a ship either has to wait to get into port (another ship is there so they have to wait) or the port cannot handle the size of the ship. In Third World countries this is common (The Caribbean). Anchorage is not out in the middle of the ocean but rather some miles off-shore. In many of these countries (Third World) getting black market cargo on board is not only easy, it is standard operating procedure (anyone heard of cartels?). So loading cargo would never be a problem. Off-loading in the US, EUR, etc is the tricky part. All being said, as most black market deals in the originating countries typically take small bribes... finding some of those sources might be very fruitful. Look for ports that are owned or operated by the hosting county and pay attention to any that have a local union. Then contact the union boss, if there is money involved, they will gladly talk.

            Also keep in mind GW Bush's push to get approval for UAE's Dubai Ports to take over some of our major ports.
           </p>
           <p>
            "Brushing aside objections from Republicans and Democrats alike, President Bush endorsed the takeover of shipping operations at six major U.S. seaports by a state-owned business in the United Arab Emirates. He pledged to veto any bill Congress might approve to block the agreement.
The president on Tuesday defended his administration’s earlier approval of the sale of London-based Peninsular and Oriental Steam Navigation Co. to Dubai Ports World, despite concerns in Congress it could increase the possibility of terrorism at American ports.
The pending sale — expected to be finalized in early March — puts Dubai Ports in charge of major shipping operations in New York, New Jersey, Baltimore, New Orleans, Miami and Philadelphia."

            "I will be taking a roadtrip from Palo Alto, CA to McAllen, Texas from December 13 to 17, with stops along the way. My stops include the Grand Canyon, Albuquerque, New Mexico, and Austin, Texas. I can help you ship a package under 70 lbs for a rate of $0.50 per pound. This means a 70 pound package would only cost you $35 to ship to Texas. If you don't need your package to go so far, I will reduce the rate. Please contact via email or text only if you are interested in shipping a package."

            Look for ports that use Anchorage as this may be a good way to smuggle cargo:
           </p>
           <p>
            An anchorage is a location at sea where ships can lower anchors.
           </p>
           <p>
            Anchorages are where anchors are lowered and utilised, whereas moorings usually are tethering to buoys or something similar. The locations usually have conditions for safe anchorage in protection from weather conditions, and other hazards.
           </p>
           <p>
            The purpose of resting a ship at sea securely can be for waiting to enter ports, as well as taking on cargo or passengers where insufficient port facilities exist.
           </p>
           <p>
            Some coastlines without port facilities have extensive anchorage locations.

            I knowi brought it up before but Lagos Nigeria Good Sheppard orphanage, there was an arrest and60 children found ina shipping container being sold to suspected slavery. Same orphanage is in Haiti. I'll try to find wha who was shipping it to start. I don't think looking for actual busts or arrests isa bad looking area to check beinga crime was already commute committed.
