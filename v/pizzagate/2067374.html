            "Paedophiles will be next in line to be recognised in the same way as gays and lesbians and get rights." ​ Keep that in mind as you consider this. The 'Safe Schools' program was developed at the La Trobe University’s Australian Research Centre in Sex, Health and Society. The Deputy Chair of this 'research' centre is Professor Gary Dowsett. In 1982, Professor Dowsett wrote an article titled, 'Boiled Lollies and Bandaids: Gay Men and Kids'. Some excerpts are below and you can read the entire thing yourself HERE: “First, we have three legal/social questions to win: custody rights for gay men and lesbians; the legal right of paedophiles and their young loves; and finally, the sexual rights of children as a whole.” “And I also have a friend, a paedophile, who is working very hard on making sense out of his relations with boys. Those relations consist of, among other things, a large amount of nurture and support for these boys, a real caring for their welfare and growth.” “How different then is that gentle, tentative sexuality between parent and child from the love of a paedophile and his/her lover? From all their accounts and from many academic studies (some worse than others), that kind of love, warmth, support and nurture is an important part of the paedophilic relationship.” “The current paedophilia debate then is crucial to the political processes of the gay movement: paedophiles need our support, and we need to construct the child/adult sex issue on our terms.”​ So not supporting pedophilia program started by a pedophilia advocate is being a homophobe. Grey matter says it again and again to me. If you don't like fucking kids you are an anti-gay homphobe because he says homosexuality is inclusive of pedophilia. To critize someone who identifies as gay who fucks kids disrespects all gays who are inclusive of their child fucking mates. Reminds me of the founder of the US gay rights movement Harry Hay who marches in gay pride parades with a T-Shirt saying NAMBLA WALKS WITH ME, and Obama's safe school Tsar Kevin Jennings being involved in child anal fisting gate aka FISTGATE.﻿

            That's the same day that George Chrisistensen gave his speech about Garry Dowsett I backed up somewhere. My saga in 2007 with the gay police, I found Kate Howe the gay cop that came after me linked to the twenty10.org.au pedo cult. That's why I left Australia when I did. I was fighting these pedos for over a decade. When Garry Burns sues anyone he wants the money to go to the twenty10.org.au child sex cult. What do they give him in return - considering they run a dorm for child prostitute rent boys.....

           </p>
           <p>
            I also put his resume on scribd. We might find more pro-pedophilia papers he wrote.

            P.M. an email address and I'll forward you what I saved from google cache back then.

           <p>
            You can see a link to his paper - "boiled lollies and band aids gay men rape kids" on the description for this interview I did with a shill 2 years go.

            Latrobe University censored his revised resume too. Here it is:

           <p>
            We need someone who is a doctor with access to medical journals / lexisnexis etc to go look up if he wrote any more pro-pedophilia papers -  hence why he updated his resume on the same day as george christensen's speech you can see here:
