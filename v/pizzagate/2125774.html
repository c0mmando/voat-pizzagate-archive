            Jeff Wells was excellent.  I think his blog was the first time I encountered the Finders. RigInt still has forums.

            There was a comment about King and highly important people being involved in a satanic ritual.  Also, someone said that he was a victim of abuse. There were things there I had not heard of before. History repeats itself, clown terror decades ago and again last year. I know people say it was just to hype up his new movie, but I believe some incidents were more than that.

             Let's get into Maine.
I feel like every woman I've met up here has been abused in some sense. Many of them have "those eyes".  Some of them will just flat out tell you. Let's not get started on on the foster system. It's almost like a rite of passage to be abused up here. The opioid epidemic is ravaging the state like the Hulk in berserker mode. So I'm sure kids are being traded for sex. Almost everyone I've met not from Maine who spend anytime outside of the Portland area will say many, not all of the people up here are "different".
            </p>
            <p>
             A few mainers have told me stories of incest, cousins dating cousins, step daughter step son rape and on and on.  The place is isolated and a mono culture. Some people up here outside Portland have never seen or interacted with non white people. Many have never even left their town or county. Still a lot of good old boy, everyone grew up together type of attitude. The judges know the cops, who know the town banker and so on.
            </p>
            <p>
             There are parts up here that are like West Virginia "deliverance". Let's put the icing on the cake, the Bushes vacation up here, many elite families have homes up here or off these islands. Speaking of Bushes, the coastline of Maine was one of the areas the nazis used to pull up uboats.
            </p>
            <p>
             A non mainer out the blue one day said to me, where the hell are all these trucks on the highway going? They aren't that many people in Maine, coastline traffic goes right up to Newfoundland. She said it would be easy to traffic people in and out of these ports cause it's been going on since WWII.
            </p>
            <p>
             Back to Stephen King. It makes total sense he would live up here cause there's some soooky shit going on. To anyon reading this from Maine. Y'all are nice people. But maybe being raised up here has made y'all accustomed to some interesting stuff.

            Well I got to the Finders stuff and read about the female goat and baby goat and it made me so sick I had to stop.  I can understand why these children ended up with the problems they did.  That could affect their whole life with years and years of therapy.  Could read no more.

              It was in the blog article...the link given in the post:  The photographs were nudes, believed to be of members of the Finders. There were numerous photos of children, some nude, at least one of which was a photo of a child "on display" and appearing to accent the child's genitals. I was only able to examine a very small amount of the photos at this time. However, one of the officers presented me with a photo album for my review. The album contained a series of photos of adults and children dressed in white sheets participating in a "blood ritual." The ritual centered around the execution of at least two goats. The photos portrayed the execution, disembowelment, skinning and dismemberment of the goats at the hands of the children. This included the removal of the testes of a male goat, the discovery of a female goat's "womb" and the "baby goats" inside the womb, and the presentation of a goat's head to one of the children. Further inspection of the premises disclosed numerous files relating to activities of the organization in different parts of the world. Locations I observed are as follows: London, Germany, the Bahamas, Japan, Hong Kong, Malaysia, Africa, Costa Rica, and "Europe." There was also a file identified as "Palestinian." Other files were identified by member name or "project" name. The projects appearing to be operated for commercial purposes under front names for the Finders. There was one file entitled "Pentagon Break-In," and others referring to members operating in foreign countries. Not observed by me but related by an MPD officer were intelligence files on private families not related to the Finders.
