            I have to say, I am disgusted at how people have treated David Seaman in the last few days. Truly disgusted. Sure, he has always been attacked - especially since he started talking about PizzaGate. 
However what shocked me is how those that supported David a few days ago have now turned their back on him because of some video. How many videos have been made to make people believe that PizzaGate is fake? How many times have people made others look crazy for talking about PizzaGate? So why do you believe this person talking about David? I just don't understand. 
I know that I will be supporting him all the way. He needed a break! In my opinion everyone researching PizzaGate should take a break. Its not healthy to be talking/thinking about this stuff all day everyday. I know, as a survivor, I have to really fight against thinking about my past etc. Its not healthy to be bogged down by such wickedness all the time. 
So if you are one of the ones that have suddenly turned their backs on David just because of one video that some guy made, I would really ask you to rethink

            Haha, come on....show me where I am a s Seaman groupie. My God....this is ridiculous unless I agree with you then the ad hominem arguments start?? My level of reasoning because of....what exactly. I haven't called you a shill or used other Saul Alkinsky tactics against you other than calling you a pussy for constantly wanting everyone to hate David Seaman. I could give a shit about Seaman but I also don't believe in this attack on a guy who has not tried to steer people into some disinfo. Agreed he talks too much about his own merits, is guilty of not doing much of his own research, doesn't bring much new material to the table, but so what?? I don't watch him that much anymore and I advise you to avoid him if he bothers you that much. Just seems overly personal with you. Now fuck off and have a nice day. You will probably reply with some more bitchiness but I am out. You won, okay!!

            I am suspect?? Oh no I am shitting my pants!! Why the fuck would I be suspect because I am growing tired of silliness regarding Seaman. I see him doing no wrong to pizzagate. He recently took on the Rothschild's. Self hating jew?? Is that his next handle by his detractors??  Enough. End of story

            I hear you, but I think once you see it you'll have not much doubt he's legit. There are a lot of people in Titus's position making good pizzagate videos that aren't getting shut down as I'm sure you're aware, it's different if you're on TV like Swann.

            Your opinion not mine. You look petty worrying about whether he parrots it back to us. Who fucking cares if he steals form us. i don't and I have had a lot of intellectual property theft. Just don't see how he does us harm and believe me I have seen him from the beginning and yes, his personality grates on me. Also he doesn't anything new to the table but still, having said all this, who fucking cares. Ignore him them, get on with what you do best and don't be a pussy.
           </p>

            I will tell you this, I heard from someone on here who had contacted him and was a survivor of ritual abuse. He blew her off. I then gave him shit in my comments to him.
           </p>
           <p>
            Few days later he did do an interview with a ritual abuse victim(not her). He amended his ways or tried to. He is not our enemy maybe somewhat useless in terms of research and borrowing from here but I don't really care. Man, if you have ever worked say on a film or a creative endevour people steal others ideas and take credit for it all the time. However if it makes the project better is what counts. Alex Jones steals like fucking mad from others and constantly brags about it being his idea, and how he was the first to report on it. That blowhard has made a career out of it

             Yep - no one makes fun of or even criticizes Alex Jones when his shit gets posted here. This guy makes a joke of everything he discusses. That's why he doesn't have a team of shills after him trying to discredit him (like David does)

            He most likely locked himself out. If you follow too many people in 1 day you can get locked. If you unfollow too many people you can get locked. We don't know the reason. He's full of so many inconsistencies how someone can trust him boggles my mind. This guy is a joke. Complete joke.

            That's bullshit, he doesn't even buy into flat earth shit. Guy might be a narcissist who fucking cares if word gets out about pizzagate? What disinfo are ya talking about?/ If anything he says the same thing over and over about Podesta. That means what? Disinfo? You think Podesta's innocent? Fuck, I don't

            Meh I saw that and I felt that way too at the time, but Titus just dropped a great epic documentary on pizzagate. He's no shill either. I was suss on him for a bit too but yeah. I guess we will come to our own conclusions.

            I have a feeling these are just stunts from him and that he'll be back on Twitter by the end of the day.

            He also said he 'lost all of his followers' and 'Twitter was silencing him' but he still has 55k followers last time I checked.

            Here's a perfect example of what seamen's all about. 16 minute video. 60 seconds of pizzagate talk. 7 minutes of self promotion and 8 minutes of bitcoin and gold promotion.

               He looks at 1 wikileaks email, talked about it for 7 minutes, leaving The Economist's business filings for other researchers to look into, asks a couple of questions, and concludes that The Economist "looks like it might be" a mouthpiece/vanity project for the Rothschild's family.

            I go up and down and up and down on whether Seaman is legit or not, I think I'm gonna settle with him being legit now unless he does something particularly suss. Nobodies perfect and just because he doesn't always deliver exactly what we want doesn't mean he's a shill. His Tapper video sold me, that was the first one of his I've watched in a while and it was good. I remember him from Rogans podcast years ago and he's still the same dude imo. Eh..

             Most don't understand who and what David Seaman's is
            </p>
            <p>
             He's untouchable and will reach many millions around the world,not for his message persé.
            </p>
            <p>
             Forever anybody pointing at Rothschild would be called either anti-Semite or Self -Hating Jew.
            </p>
            <p>
             Well,that's over now.
            </p>
            <p>
             So if Seaman is a shill,and can't be trusted ,who is he working for?
            </p>
            <p>
             He's is explaining to the world how the so-called "Jews control the world' Conspiracy works.
            </p>
            <p>
             He is an essential piece in the war against Rothschild,because nobody can shut him up.
            </p>
            <p>
             Even for most conspiracy researchers cognitive dissonance is a b*tch.

              I basically agree, he is sort of like red pill lite - light pink pill.
             </p>
             <p>
              I just don't like him saying he is a journalist.  He is not.  He is a reporter - he delivers news that others investigate and prepare for him.  He cannot share the same job title with the likes of say, a Matt Taibbi.  Glen Greenwald, or the deceased Michael Hastings.
             </p>
             <p>
              Even that he doesn't get this or is confused and calling himself the wrong thing works against him.  And he brings it up "I'M A JOURNALIST!" in every single video.
             </p>
             <p>
              He needs a PR person/researcher and support, like a news anchor would have a news team.  Who knows maybe that is what they are planning for him at this news outlet he is signing on too.  I hope so.
             </p>
             <p>
              Other than that, let him keep talking, the more the merrier.

               Agreed.  I am in a war on here with others because I am basically saying 'go ahead, don't like him if you want, but what is he doing to hurt Pizzagate, at least he is still talking about it'. 
I admit he doesn't bring anything new to the table usually and if he does, it is something we here have already discussed. 
Having said all that, I am now being called names and a Seaman groupie??? 
Tell you the truth VieBleu, I don't even like Seaman that much but I refuse to say he is hurting pizzagate and then they attack me again saying that Seaman is  supporting flat Earth theories?? I watched that video, he was actually denouncing the Flat earth stuff. Man oh man, feeling weird that so many want me to hate Seaman? Why?? 
One of the few people online talking about Pizzagate almost everyday.
What is this fascination with hating Seaman?? And if you don't get in line then you are a shill??!!! What!???

                Don't forget that's a shill objective, - attack anyone public who puts their head up for pizzagate.  They attack Seaman, IsThisGameOfThrones, Kutcher (may be some validity not sure yet) even Roseanne Barr.  the only one they don't attack is James Woods but the commenter "Long Knife" even got one in on him today!
               </p>
               <p>
                Don't take it too seriously.  If someone is here spending a lot of time on that they aren't here to make progress anyway.  Voat has a very committed anti-semetic bunch of racists who love acting like they are important by attacking a Jewish target, so there's that.  Sincere PG people have made up their mind about Seaman and he doesn't need any defense - let the haters waste their time spittling on each other.   He's going to motor on doing what he does.  I am hoping this new gig gets him a little more structure and direction which would be good for him..

             it is the the relentless cringeworthy self promotion which is wrong. if he actually discussed PG instead of himself and his 'fans' the visibility might be useful to the cause. when one learns of seaman's real 'journalist' history as an reviled intern at gawker and an non-salaried fired huffington blogger the self promotion makes much more sense. he has been unsuccessfully trying to claw out a career in journalism for a decade or more. he is now obviously trying to use PG to increase his visibility and audience which naturally seems a bit opportunistic to many of us. he isn't a shill, he is just mediocre and self serving.

             it sounds like you have identified a pattern. i also desperately want him to be legit but his behavior continues to prove otherwise.

               i'm a shill because i think david seaman isn't contributing value to the goal of publicizing PG and bringing down the establishment? does everyone who believes in PG need to blindly support him? if i was on brock's team i assure you i would be supporting DS as the spokesperson of the PG community because it lessens our collective credibility. we may need a PG jesus but it isn't david seaman (unfortunately).
