            Great comment - I disagree but its a good discussion.  Where I disagree is this - yes it is semantics, but semantics can be important.  WORDS are important, as viral memes ably demonstrate.  And I see precisely the opposite - to gain more traction with the public, cloak the "SATANISM!" talk with dark arts and other phrases because the public is 1) braintrained to dismiss Satan worshipping cults as either false memory syndrome or the stuff of tv shows  2) it tends to marginalize the pizzagate investigation as something that fevered Christian zealots are launching along with the War On Christmas and other campaigns.  Pizzagate is far too wide reaching to be pigeonholed like that.
           </p>
           <p>
            Fight spiritual warfare Christians, I certainly support you in that.  I do it in my own way as well.  But understand that in order to really fight well, you need to camoflage yourselves a bit and not bring pizzagate into the culture wars arena which will cause it to polarize rather than broaden in support.  So all I am saying is educate yourselves, there are real differences in non-Christian cults that whether you care or not, if you want to speak to the public you should be able to converse ably.  So use dark arts, use sorcery, use more general terms that describe something definitely harmful and negative, just not centered around your particular embodiement of evil the Devil.   This is a PR battle as much as it is an information war - win the PR battle, win the war.

            It's a good article.  A lot of what is said in it is right on.  Christian fundamentalists too often dismiss anything not directly out of the bible as "the devil's work".  I think the term "satanist" is over used with pizzagate and on this forum specifically.  What would be more accurate would be to refer to what she does as "black magic", "dark arts", perhaps even "sorcery".   But not SATANISM, because you specifically have to buy into the Judeo-Christian idea of a character called Satan in order to practice Satanism, and this is easy not to do, especially if you aren't Christian.
           </p>
           <p>
            If you read the article CAREFULLY, what the author actually gets around to saying in this article is (paraphrasing) "Abramovic is not a Satanist...Crowley was not a Satanist."  So Abramovic and Crowley - self described "Beast" - are of the same ilk - they both come from a position of being "above" your average devil worshipper, so to speak.  Abramovic could very well be teaching her version of Crowleyism, which would be black magic indeed.  Her version of "healing" may very well incorporate Crowley's "do as thou wilt be the whole of the law" which then takes you into areas of harming others to gain energy, bodily goods, sex, whatever it takes for your "healing".  And that's when the line is crossed legally, ethically and morally which is what concerns the pizzagate investigation.  If we somehow "prove" they are devil worshippers, nothing happens at all.  If we prove that illegal activities occured, they can be arrested and punished with incarceration.  Big difference.
           </p>
           <p>
            I'm very glad this article was posted - good discussion is needed here.  I vehemently disagree with the commentors on this thread who want to airily dismiss the distinctions made by the admittedly condescending Italian author.  I do agree that it is an attempt to intellectualize what Abramovic does into a realm where it seems like a sort of harmless hobby/art.  It is dismissive, and it is hanging that dismissal on a close reading of the vast majority of accusations coming from people who  are unaware of and refuse to concern themselves with real distinctions between some different cults.
           </p>
           <p>
            Christians, if you really want to fight Lucifer and Satan then continue to remain ignorant of this kind of material at your peril - on the contrary, you need to understand these distinctions inside out and speak about them with authority.  Do do less than that only hurts the pizzagate cause.

             This splitting hairs about what one child raping piece of shit who is outside of mere Christianity and worships Xenu or whatever wants to be called is bullshit, and the linked article is garbage.
            </p>
            <p>
             Take that satanic concern trolling shit elsewhere. Who the fuck cares about the preferences of a group of psychopaths and their made up degree system of magick and how they want to be called? These people are liars. They hate being called Satanists because it's true. Their bullshit made up metaphysics doesn't concern me. "But no, no, they are Thelemites!". WHO THE FUCK CARES? Are you here to masturbate or change hearts and minds? Go have a discussion of the Temple of Set at some sub-reddit.

             Actually, if you do prove this somehow you'd win. Perception is everything. No one is going to prove that, but if you could, you'd win.

              Thanks for working hard to clean up things I know it isn't easy.  That said if this guy is one of your new mods, no thanks.  Can you kindly ask him to TONE DOWN his verbal abuse and shit comments like this one to me?  I posted a very reasonable comment, not a concern thread BTW, under a submission about being smarter about labeling everything Satanism.  I don't know what button I pushed for him and don't care - he added NOTHING to the discussion and is too emotional for the job of modding IMHO.  Consider this a complaint against him as a mod.  Thanks for listening.

             So why quote a Blondie song?
            </p>
            <p>
             If you're attentive to all the information available about PG as I'm sure most are and convinced in your own heart and mind about its breadth and veracity as I, then the image of one Debbie Harry skillfully plunging a knife into a cake like image of God(Genesis 1:27 I believe in this Triune God)at one of Abramovics all star gatherings should suffice to show we are opposed by many with power and influence in this world. I'm posting to support VieBleu's contention that intellectualizing away the spiritual dimension(Abramovic or Harry or Podesta)is dismissive because: "If we somehow "prove" they are devil worshippers, nothing happens at all. If we prove that illegal activities occured, they can be arrested and punished with incarceration. Big difference."
I'm encouraged by the tenacity of many on here to seek out the truth of this matter and I too will be praying and shining light into the darkness looking for those trying to trick ya and give you the slip

             I was reading some additional info about the Golden Dawn &amp; betrayal of the order by Aleister Crowley preventing the completion of the entire 3 Order system for over a century. looks like they sell access to additional so called "Spiritual" info on this site.

             1st Order taught through symbols, and its 
2nd Order practices Lunar Magick that refers by analogy to the Solar Magick and Alchemy of its 3rd Order.

             Really good point. I have been reading books that the OTO website promotes to gain a real understanding because the one's on YouTube or average devil worship is not sufficient and probably what they want you to think to keep black magic hidden. It seems to really go back to the secrets of Solomon, Abraham the jew, probably learned by Egyptian priesthood and the knowledge of kabbala ect. 
Seems to be for now from early research is the knowledge of invocation of entities 
and how to use these entities for your own desire 
Wich obviously can be used for good or evil

            I know a lot about spiritualism, and I believe myself to be a truly spiritual person. This article is so incredibly vague and weak in many points (no wonder!), and only people with no understanding of satan and spiritualism may tend to believe it. In short: bullshit. Marina is a satanist.

             It often gets even more complicated and scary. I know people who say they are truly spiritual (and act like that), but when you get to know them better, you find that they are actually "from the other side". Only thing one can do: trust your heart.
