<p>For Those Looking at McCain: You MUST realize AZ is one of the WORST states Concerning Government Child Trafficking Through CPS</p>
<p>GOP senator: AZ foster kids are being sold into sexual slavery</p>
<p>A senator who is convinced that the Arizona Dept of Child Safety is facilitating the global sex trafficking of children removed from  parents called the police alleging that one of his GOP colleagues, threatened his life.</p>
<p>Sen. David Farnsworth, filed a report with the Az Dept of Public Safety this week accusing Sen. Kate Brophy McGee,of threatening him if he didn’t stop investigating the claim. : &quot;\'I\'m not asking you to stop. I\'m telling you to stop.\'&quot; </p>
<p>Farnsworth said that he has been looking into how DCS “lost” more than 550 children last year, roughly half of whom are categorized as either runaways or otherwise missing. The rest appear to be flagged for paperwork errors.</p>
<p>He fears the children have been abducted and sold into a global sex trafficking ring, and said he has been holding meetings with DCS, critics of the agency and fellow lawmakers, and Brophy McGee.</p>
<p>Farnsworth  said it’s not a conspiracy theory. He didn’t believe DCS officials were actively selling children into sexual slavery, but that they are being lax at protecting children from predators who will do so.  he said he hopes his meetings ultimately prove him wrong, he is more convinced than ever that Arizona children removed from their parents and put into group homes or foster homes are being sex-trafficked, even though  he has turned up no evidence. </p>
<p>“.........I believed that children from Arizona (DCS) were ending up in sex trafficking. Now, after the research I’ve done, I’m confident of it,” .“But I can’t prove it.”</p>
<p>Farnsworth also alleged that two former Republican state senators from other states were killed within days of each other earlier this year while exposing child trafficking an cps. There is no evidence that either ex-legislator was murdered for that reason. ( This writer is not on his game.https://www.blogtalkradio.com/speakproject/2019/06/05/speak-up-with-tank-walker-series-3)</p>
<p>The dispute between Farnsworth and Brophy McGee stems from what she said was a conversation in which she told her colleague that both she and her husband were concerned for her safety after some of Farnsworth’s allies in the child-sex-ring investigation began harrassing her and spreading rumors that she and others are involved in illicit child kidnapping schemes. Brophy McGee told the publication that Farnsworth’s compatriots are “unbalanced” and have forced her to have Senate security guards escort her to and from meetings about DCS, but Farnsworth has been unconcerned.</p>
<p>while he initially didn’t take Brophy McGee’s comments seriously, he decided to file a complaint with DPS because the “best deterrent to a threat is for more people to be aware of it.”</p>

            Anyone know a good link that rates each state on how much child sex trafficking is even on the record.Sorry there has been such a clamp down on posting links  as I would post this one on FB. The little story I wrote here bears repeating. My state of Maine , which is actually great, had a gov. who was asking for good looking children for the foster care program.Then a foster care girl was found bound and gagged in a basement, dead. Then he reduced the number of social workers who checked on the foster care children.Then he became one of our senators. ..has a very dignified and senatorial look about him. This was in a Bangor Daily News comment. People can no longer make comments online for that newspaper.........very few are allowing comments anymore......even Huff Po. .

            We have heard of Sen. Nancy Shaffer and her husband. She travelled all over talking about the stealing of the Children by CPS. She was killed and her husband was found dead too. Don’t you know they called it a murder suicide by the husband. Another miscarriage of justice.

            CPS just took my neighbors kid over a full septic tank vault... the wife had state workers there &amp; she called me when they commented about the sewage smell.. (land-lord is a slum lord.) i came over, located the vault.. under the trailer, of-course. &amp; got ahold ot the brother. ( i do some work for him as an engineer/fabricator &amp; ocasionaly rent shop-space) the land-lord is not gonna pump the vault, so they were in the process of packing &amp; moving. the cps shits talked the wife into going to the hospital with the baby.. to make sure it hadnt been exposed to sewage, and they just flat out took her. i warned the wife NOT to trust them dont let them in, get off the free diaper &amp; formula program, dont let them know where your moving. dont let them touch the baby.. but free gibs &amp; a possible rent voucher...= snatched baby

             People are still asleep. They believe we have a benevolent government while they traffic our children and force unwarranted medical treatment on them. This is what made me turn to Q. I've had conversations with Mothers whom had their children taken. One woman related that her boy stopped speaking after being molested in a foster home. It was reported to DCS that did nothing except tell the kid to shut up, and made him stay there. One of my kids was taken for nearly 2 years of high school and it took years of counseling to recover. They hire demons to take your children. These are not humans.

            I read all three links.  Still don't quite understand why Brophy McGee felt so threatened.  Makes .me think she knows a whole lot more than she is letting on.  And then for her to make that lame excuse that she was just saying things in a way a "patriarchal" guy would understand???  No, she is a progressive in gop clothing.  Y'all need to get rid of her, ASAP

              Yes, I get why Farnsworth made the complaint.  I don't get why the lady was so upset about him investigating, UNLESS she knows something that Farnsworth doesn't know..... or something like that.  And her excuse of bringing her husband into it, as if HE were the one upset, well, that doesn't pass the smell test with me.
