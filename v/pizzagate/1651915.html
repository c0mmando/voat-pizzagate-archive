<p>Today, most of the cane cutters are gone from the Fanjul fields in South Florida, replaced by machinery. But the Fanjul family remains tight with the Clintons, donating at least $100,000 to the Clinton Foundation. Records show Alfy Fanjul met numerous times privately with Secretary of State Clinton. In August, shortly after the Democratic National Convention, Fanjul, his wife, Raysa, and former Ambassador Paul Cejas and his wife host a $100,000-per-couple dinner at Cejas’ Miami Beach mansion for the Democratic nominee who decries the unfair clout of the rich.</p>
<p>2013, after a two-year investigation, the department issued a report expressing concern that the Dominican government might be failing to protect sugar workers. The report was followed by three reviews, one every six months, that found working conditions still lacking. But as the DOL pushed for reform in Dominican sugar, members of Congress and other politicians maintained lucrative relationships with the royal family of cane: the Fanjuls.</p>

<p>Haitians in the DR have faced harsh conditions for over a century. They were the targets of a massacre ordered by Dominican dictator Rafael Trujillo in 1937, and they endured periodic mass deportations throughout the 20th century. Today there is a renewed threat of expulsion for hundreds of thousands of Haitians and their descendants who were not able to meet a June 17 deadline to register for legal papers. The Dominican foreign minister says tens of thousands have returned to Haiti voluntarily, but according to media reports and the New York-based nonprofit Human Rights Watch, people are being forced out, including some born in the DR.</p>
