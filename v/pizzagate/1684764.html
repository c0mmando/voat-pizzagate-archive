            Ever heard of Cardinal Bernardin? Great friend of the Clintons, arranged for a gay choir to sing at his funeral. The diocese of LA is full of degenerates too. The Catholic Church has been infiltrated for years.

           <p>
            Some time ago I was wondering if bringing up the case of archbishop Wesolowski is of any importance here (the scope of pizzagate seemed smaller at that time). Now I regret I didn't put it sooner on the radar here.
           </p>
           <p>
            So Wesolowski was a Polish priest who has been accused of paedophilia (child abuse) and possessing child pornography (another Polish priest Wojciech Gil has also been accused), and more. The allegations came up in 2013. while he was Apostolic Nuncio to the Dominican Republic (he was on this position since 2008). 
The Domican Republic shared the island with Haiti.
Wesolowski has been recorded while walking on the streets of a district known for homosexual prostitution. During the investigation many incriminating files have been discovered on his two computers: more than 86 000 photos, 130 video recording as well as remains of 45000 already deleted files. Whenever I see the numbers being so big, I am wondering how huge the popularity of this perversion.
           </p>
           <p>
            He has been expelled from priesthood and his trial in Vatican was about to start in July 2015. One day before the planned start of the court proceedings he has been hospitalized. 1 and a half month later he was found dead in his residence. Yes, heart attack... again.
           </p>
           <p>
            So here is the list of connections to Pizzagate:
- generally Vatican leads recently gaining more and more attention here
- Dominican/Haiti location
- death due to heart attack, just before the trial
- elite (Vatican diplomat)
- the sense of impunity and the number of evidence (recording, files etc) that indicates it may be only a small part of a bigger, organized network
           </p>
           <p>
            worth more digging, I think

             One more thing, someone here mentioned his last name being identical to the name of a child abduction victim 
Wesolowski is a quite common family name in Poland, however it's always worth investigating, especially the this name appears twice far from Poland and in the same context - child abuse.

            Vatican prosecutors had accused Mr. Wesolowski of sexually abusing children in the Dominican Republic, where he worked from 2008 to 2013 as the Vatican’s ambassador. They said that he picked up poor boys on the waterfront, paid them for sexual acts and took pornographic photographs of them.

            Jozef Wesolowski, Ex-Archbishop Accused of Sexual Abuse, Dies at 67

            Jozef Wesolowski in 2011. He was found dead in the Vatican on Friday.
           </p>
           <pre><code>ROME — Jozef Wesolowski, a Polish former archbishop who would have been the first high-level cleric to stand before a Vatican tribunal on charges of child sexual abuse, was found dead early Friday, the Vatican said in a statement. He was 67.
Initial examinations carried out by Vatican officials “determined that his death occurred from natural causes,” the statement said.
Mr. Wesolowski died in his Vatican City residence, where he had lived since September, after he was placed under house arrest. He was found by one of the Franciscan friars who lived in the same house, said a Vatican spokesman, the Rev. Ciro Benedettini.
An autopsy was conducted on Friday, but the results would not be immediately available, Father Benedettini said.
Vatican prosecutors had accused Mr. Wesolowski of sexually abusing children in the Dominican Republic, where he worked from 2008 to 2013 as the Vatican’s ambassador. They said that he picked up poor boys on the waterfront, paid them for sexual acts and took pornographic photographs of them.
Already defrocked under canon law in 2014, Mr. Wesolowski was facing a prison sentence of up to eight years if found guilty.
The case of Mr. Wesolowski caused an international controversy when it became known that the Vatican, upon learning of the allegations, had spirited him out of the country before he could be investigated by local authorities, and then invoked diplomatic immunity so that he could not face trial in the Dominican Republic.

            Vatican Envoy Dies While Awaiting Trial
A spokesman for the Vatican announced that Jozef Wesolowski, a former Vatican envoy who had been charged with child sex abuse, was found dead in his apartment on Friday morning.

• 
	Then the Vatican decided to try him at home. His trial, which began on July 11, would have been the first case of sexual abuse argued out in a Vatican tribunal, and it became emblematic of Pope Francis’ proactive approach to dealing with the child sexual abuse accusations that have plagued the Roman Catholic Church in recent decades.
	At the first hearing, which lasted less than 10 minutes, the Vatican’s chief prosecutor, Gian Piero Milano, argued that Mr. Wesolowski had caused serious psychological distress and harm to the youths, said to be ages 13 to 16.
	He was also accused of having offended “Christian morality” by repeatedly logging onto pornographic sites involving minors in the Dominican Republic and Vatican City.
Papal Responses to Sexual Abuse in the Church
• 
	The trial was unexpectedly adjourned that same day because Mr. Wesolowski had been admitted to an intensive care unit in an Italian hospital for an “unexpected illness” the day before. No new date had been set for its resumption.
	Francis is not the first pope to have addressed the issue of sexual abuse of minors by members of the clergy, but he has drafted new rules giving prosecutors more leeway in the cases, allowing criminal charges to be applied to Vatican employees anywhere. He is the first pope to take action against senior officials accused of covering up for priests by creating a new tribunals system, that has not been used yet, that would call bishops to account.
	Because of his health, Mr. Wesolowski was effectively confined to Vatican City, although he was allowed to move around the grounds freely, Father Benedettini said.
	This week, the advocacy group BishopAccountability.org raised concerns that “this loosening of restrictions raises urgent child safety concerns.” It called for Mr. Wesolowski to be “heavily guarded at all times,” otherwise “unaccompanied minors in Vatican City could be at risk,” the group said in a statement.

             These demented perverted sick jerks should be locked behind bars in a jail cell, not floating around in the Vatican, getting wine, good food and a wonderful bed and CP to boot.  This reminds me of the Retreats they are sent to in St. Louis Mo.  Club Ped one of them is known as.
