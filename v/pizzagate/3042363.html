            Wow that’s horrible. Certainly there can be truth within that report about the other Children. We have heard so many stories and articles about the Child actors that were abused. Many ended I taking their own lives due to drugs and drinking which was caused by the sexual abuse they suffered. So glad the one writing the article escaped their clutches. I can’t even imagine the thoughts he must live with though. Thinking about those other Children after all those years.
