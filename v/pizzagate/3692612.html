            I have unfortunately known about this for over 24 years and I have trying yelling about it,making films and theatre plays about it.,art that deals with it and always always crickets UNTIL recently. The horror is so overwhelming I have understood why people resist the truth about it.My llife and my children were the causalities of it. Had every possible kind of ridicule and hate directed at me yet I have maintained my course and yes,the truth, as awful as it is, is coming out. For any of us revealing these truths there is no award. I don't know if God is going tro hand me a trophy on the other side, I doubt it but I felt compelled to speak out anyway.It takes a lot out of any us that have had to accept the reality that this kind of evil exists plus the realization that the powers that be hate my guts for speaking of it. Imagine the horror of going to police and children's support groups to have ALL doors slammed in my face! What is fucking amazing is I am not so alone anymore and I thank anyone out there that has had the courage to look at what this is.

             Thank you for keeping the flame alive. It's not easy. So many people don't want to hear about it or learn anything remotely related to it. I'm sorry you and your children have been in the trenches, but if it weren't for the suffering of you and others, we wouldn't be here. I'm honored to be fighting this battle and know that we will win, even if it happens next year, next decade, or long after my physical self is no longer here. I'm at peace knowing I'm fighting evil even though myself and others are laughed at and ridiculed. It's a small price to pay considering what some of their victims have endured. Just look at how this thread is getting downvoted and attacked. Proof positive that this is one of the main puzzle pieces they don't want people to know about. Take care and be well, friend.

              Upon reflection it disturbs me that I’ve eaten adrenalized animal meat on such a regular basis over the years. Lately I’ve tended to lean in the direction of vegetarian foods. I’ve decided to stop eating adrenalized meat. Kosher meat is not adrenalized, and there are enlightened farmers who avoid adrenalizing their animals when they slaughter them.

             This is probably an evangelical christian website, the biggest that we face because traitors are always more dangerous than foreign enemies.

            I've heard that these people cast spells using the energy of terror and the rush of killing and torturing someone because it's wrong. So it amplifies the law to manifest on this planet. Gives it more power. Sick demented shit!
