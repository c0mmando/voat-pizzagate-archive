<p>Originally I was looking more specifically for police and politic corruption in Chicago, which there was plenty of evidence for..so I narrowed it down to things going on around the same time Gacy was around and I got this: <a href="http://archives.chicagotribune.com/1977/05/16/page/1/article/chicago-is-center-of-national-child-porno-ring">http://archives.chicagotribune.com/1977/05/16/page/1/article/chicago-is-center-of-national-child-porno-ring</a> (child porn ring found in Chicago, Delta Project.)</p>
<p>So I moved on to how it might relate directly to Gacy and I came across this: <a href="https://johnwaynegacynews.com/2016/06/20/child-sex-trafficking-in-chicago-the-missing-link-in-the-gacy-mystery/">https://johnwaynegacynews.com/2016/06/20/child-sex-trafficking-in-chicago-the-missing-link-in-the-gacy-mystery/</a> (others have come to the same conclusions about Gacy was probably part of a sex ring.)</p>
<p>During all this I was bouncing around the idea of how politics could be directly linked to crimes and how do these people meet and whatnot..and I came across this: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Junior_Chamber">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Junior_Chamber</a> (This is a list of notable members of The United States Junior Chamber, also called Jaycee. This list has Bill Clinton and John Wayne Gacy on it which can both be verified individually but this is the only place that has them together.)</p>
<p>Tony Podesta cut the ribbon to the opening of a new campus with Governor Kerner and Mayor Richard J Daley. <a href="http://www.chicagomag.com/Chicago-Magazine/Felsenthal-Files/December-2013/How-the-Podesta-Brothers-Rose-From-the-39th-Ward-to-the-White-House/">http://www.chicagomag.com/Chicago-Magazine/Felsenthal-Files/December-2013/How-the-Podesta-Brothers-Rose-From-the-39th-Ward-to-the-White-House/</a> (Q&amp;A with Tony, still looking into this one.) Richard J Daleys was mayor from 1955 to 1976. His son, Richard M Daley, was mayor from 1989 to 2011.</p>
<p>And Jack Reilly, Chicago special-events director under Mayor Richard J Daley got Gacy the job of director for Chicago’s Polish Constitution Day Parade because he had done so well with the Demorcatic Day parade. <a href="http://mrssatan.blogspot.com/2007/10/john-wayne-gacy-was-democrat.html">http://mrssatan.blogspot.com/2007/10/john-wayne-gacy-was-democrat.html</a> (some light on Gacys involvement with the Democrats.) </p>
<p>The mayor since 2011 is Rahm Emanuel. He was the Director of the finance committee for Bill Clinton1992 presidential campaign. In 1993 he joined the Clinton Administration, serving as the assistant to the president for political affairs and as the senior advisor to the president for policy and strategy. He held a seat at the U.S. House of Representatives from 2003 to 2009. And finally in 2008 Barack Obama appointed Emanuel to serve as White House chief of staff. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rahm_Emanuel">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rahm_Emanuel</a></p>
<p>Fun fact: Hilary Clinton and John Wayne Gacy were born in the same hospital.</p>

            I only didn't include any republican things because I have not ventured that far into it. The article about Gacys democratic involvement wasn't the best choice as it does have a certain tone to it (I honestly thought some may enjoy it and it was one I found that touched the most points, rather then posting multiple). I am currently working on reworking all this so it doesn't have those and isn't sloppy lol. I threw this together and didn't think it would keep expanding like it has. Apologies for the mess.

           <p>
            According to the article, Johns would travel with the boys overseas, so the index cards were handed to the State Department because of possible "passport fraud".

           <p>
            Interestingly, the Chicago Tribune got an additional list of 5000 names from a "source". I'm curious if they still have this list, and what someone would have to do in order to see it.

            Many of these people involved were groomed from birth or early childhood for this activity. Some being adopted for that reason. When I come across another article that discusses that I will post it. It's all so diabolical and unreal. I can't believe this is how the upper echelons of power in America have been operating for a long long time.

             Child Porno Ring in Chicago

            in 1977. Right in the middle of Gacy's "cruising years".
           </p>
           <p>
            edit; From the article -
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             a clandestine newsletter is being published in Chicago which serves as a conduit for perverts throughout America in engaging children in pornographic modeling and prostitution and in making contact with one another.
            </p>
           </blockquote>
           <p>
            The article states the ring was active in (at least) Chicago, LA, and Dallas under the name Delta Project, newsletter called "Hermes"

            I read a recent article by Yoichi Shimatsu and he wrote that WJC was a CIA agent.  I also saw on Wikileaks Twitter yesterday that Gloria Steinem admits to being an agent for the CIA as well.  She said that it was liberal leaning.  Well, it started out with George HW Bush at the head. Yes, Soros is heavily involved so I believe they are all in this together by now. Strange Bedfellows.  We must dig dig dig.

             Very interested in what it says. Just to make sure, before I order the wrong book or something, you mean Programmed to Kill, right? It was on my list of books to buy anyways but if it has links it may have just jumped up in queue. Still debating between buying lots of books or saving up to buy an official copy of A Question of Doubt by Gacy.

             Well after reading that, a lot more things I read stand out to me. Namely him wearing a pin to Democratic events that indicated he had been given "special secret service clearance". And another account by someone saying he always had large amounts of pills and money , so much that there was no way it came from his business. I also did read he was named on a Chicago's top 100 before he was caught but I cannot for the life of me find that article again or the original source.

              Just like Alefantis is in the top 49 in DC.  What a coincidence!  Kwinky-dink?  I think not.  They give them Carte Blanche to all wonderful access available in our city.  They are able to be where ever they really want.  Ribbon cuttings, parades, etc.  All events including children without being suspect.  Why?  Because they have this man about town and government clearance that gains them respect.  UNTIL it is put in question.  Like now.  We need to bring out some suspect things Alefantis is guilty of.  Things that may have happened when he was there or in the vicinity of.  Enough reason to create suspicion.  The problem? MSM.

             The Wikipedia page uses the term "chicken hawk" in the serial killer section.

             I believe they allow these people to operate freely until something that happens or gets too close to the power structure. I have a feeling there are many creepy guys out there doing sick things and supplying entertainment like this guy who seems to know just what he can get away with and also tells his viewers he has pics and vids of visiting a young girl in Maine that are for sale "the usual way" This is an older archive since after months of operation he was finally taken down

               There are over 800 results for "Wisconsin Podesta" search.  Most deal with policy, but there was a voat thread a few weeks ago that said something about scaling down or quieting down the Wisconsin project. The timing coincided with the Dahmer murders.  Most likely not useful in the pizzagate sense, at least for the purposes here.  I think we'll all be surprised, tho, when the actual arrests begin.  It will start with people we've never heard of.

            Great post! Is there a reason that you left out mentioning Dean Corll outside of the Tribunal article? I'm sure that other readers would find it interesting that two serial killers with the same victim preference are linked to John David Norman and his child abuse ring. What I found even more interesting is the lack of information available about Norman and that nobody else has really made these connections before.

             I saw the Dean Corll thread over the weekend and couldn't comment until now. This seems a good a place as any. In the '90s I used to read "true crime" books. Watching the news over the years I made a few connections.
            </p>
            <ul>
             <li>
              Here in VA, we had a serial killer/serial rapist named Jesse Matthew who fled and was strangely found on one of Corll's gave sites:
              <a href="http://www.newser.com/story/196439/jesse-matthew-was-hiding-in-age-old-hiding-spot.html">
               http://www.newser.com/story/196439/jesse-matthew-was-hiding-in-age-old-hiding-spot.html
              </a>
              Matthew was a taxi driver and former college party rapist.
             </li>
             <li>
              Also here in VA, we have had girls who are 5'6" and 120-130 lbs (but usually exactly 120 lbs) either disappear or turn up dead for the past several years. Some are teenagers, some are women, and one was a transgender woman. Some have been proven to be killed by different people.
             </li>
             <li>
              Alexis Murphy was a teenaged girl who was abducted and certainly raped and killed in Central VA by Randolph Taylor:
              <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murder_of_Alexis_Murphy">
               https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murder_of_Alexis_Murphy
              </a>
              There is a lot of circumstantial evidence that connects Matthew to Alexis, although he was cleared by DNA and it seems pretty solid that Taylor killed her. She randomly talked to Matthew online at some point and walked past his distinctive looking car right before she disappeared. Murphy and Matthew's victims were all 5'6" and 120 lbs. Some people have wondered if there's a ring here in VA.
             </li>
             <li>
              I see people already read up on Gacy's connections. The BTK killer was involved in local politics. He was the dog catcher and in on...maybe like the city council or something like that?
             </li>
             <li>
              <p>
               There was a 13 year old girl murdered by a couple of Virginia Tech students recently:
               <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/public-safety/va-tech-students-make-first-court-appearances-in-death-of-13-year-old-girl/2016/02/01/5c8d4732-c8f6-11e5-ae11-57b6aeab993f_story.html">
                https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/public-safety/va-tech-students-make-first-court-appearances-in-death-of-13-year-old-girl/2016/02/01/5c8d4732-c8f6-11e5-ae11-57b6aeab993f_story.html
               </a>
               This was notable for a couple of reasons. For one, this young girl was already "dating" grown men. Her parents were lower class and seemed too busy with their own business to notice what she was doing. Maybe that's way how these kids get into this. The other reason it's notable is because the female killer was from the DC metro area, wanted to work at NASA one day, and I believe came from an upper class family. Fits a PG narrative.

               There is a TV show that just aired on A&amp;E called...The Killing Season:
               <a href="http://www.aetv.com/shows/the-killing-season">
                http://www.aetv.com/shows/the-killing-season
               </a>
               That show has a lot of information and small tales about serial killers and prostitutes. Keep in mind that we keep hearing over and over that these kids are "prostitutes". The show goes into that and how often the kids' parents never report them missing. So no one knows if they've been killed or are captive somewhere or what. They say there is no way to estimate how many people may have been killed.
              </p>
             </li>
             <li>
              The Killing Season is always talking about this web forum, which I think existed prior to the show:
              <a href="http://www.websleuths.com/forums/forum.php">
               http://www.websleuths.com/forums/forum.php
              </a>
              It's people sharing information about serial killers. Might be helpful for PG research.

              Thanks for posting this! I remember reading some dark web shit about how a female, about 120 pounds, and around 5'6" would produce the best meat for consumption. Got way to graphic so I had to stop reading but I will never forget the parts I did read.

               That's horrifying. I think the ones that were found were skeletal. One woman got away from Matthew and went back to her home country of...I think India.

             I don't feel I've looked far enough into it to add more layers to everything just yett. I also got very tired so I decided to put what I had so far out so people could build off of it if they see something I didn't!

              Well if you have any suggestions about how I can help/where you would like research focused while you research another aspect just let me know. My google-fu isn't the best but I'm usually persistent enough to figure out potential links and what to look for.

            Good lord, never knew Gacy's connections to the Dems.  If he had similar links to the Repubs we would have never heard the end of it.  Nice research OP, keep digging y'all!
