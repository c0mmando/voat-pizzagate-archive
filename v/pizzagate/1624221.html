            They're doing this on purpose, it's to hide the fact that the "fake news" narrative is really about silencing the right. The left has a completely different outlook on what fake news is, they know their being fed fake news. Because of this they agree with the fake news narrative and do not question it. It keeps them from getting curious or feeling like they aren't informed. Feed them some fake news, then they know the have seen it first hand so they go along with the fake news narrative feeling like they understand the issue. They don't see the real side of it, and how it's really being used.

             From my own conversations, it seems that what they see is very very little.  Almost nothing at all but headlines and sometimes not even that, just rumors of headlines.

            Obvious NLP (Neuro-linguistic Programming) used in the article and the headline: "Fake news for liberals: misinformation starts to lean left under Trump." As one reads, it's reinforced. While not directly accusing Trump, it's obvious who they're attributing the rise in fake news to. Yet again, another Strawman being set up by one of the most feminist, multi-culturalist rags we know as The Guardian.

             lol as biased as the Guardian is, I get it's daily newshash because it is slightly MORE level-headed than the media in America.  I read to see what his opposition is posturing on next re Trump.
            </p>
            <p>
             For me this was interesting because they do actually outline that a whole lot of viral news re major hot button issues has been outright lies.  Haven't seen that anywhere else yet.

              I hear ya. I check the Guardian every morning just to see what they're pushing and how they're spinning it. Early on, I began to notice they had a clear agenda: down with the family as an institution (which is parallel with Satanism,

              , Feminism, LGBT, etc.) and the State taking over the role (

               Communism/Socialism
              </a>
              ), down with the government (this one is hard to spot but if you watch
              <strong>
               <em>
                how

              </strong>
              the piece is written and

              the agenda becomes clear), 'civil rights' and 'social justice' (these being in the open yet with ulterior motives. i.e. look at all this 'diversity' and 'politically correct' b.s. being spewed out of colleges (
              <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WHyvRHrYYBA">

              ) and Universities. Tearing down a nation's laws and traditions through 'refugee crises' (appeal to emotion) and 'illegal immigrant' acceptance (appeal to emotion, appeal to the majority, appeal to popular belief -- all logical fallacies.) It's the

              </a>
              strategy used for cultural marxism. Inundate the system and the system will collapse... (think refugees, welfare, etc.) Sorry to be so long winded (long-fingered?) but my belief is that focusing on getting everyone on the same page of truth in history is essential to overcoming the mess we're in. Cheers.

            If I remember correctly, the Guardian was the first to be involved exposing wikileaks and Snowden when no one else was and I think Glenn Greenwald worked there before starting the Intercept.

             You are correct.... sadly, shortly after that the paper got a new editor and started towing the globalist, pro europe, anti putin, pro clinton, pro syrian "moderate rebels" and pro destroying ukraine line....I used to actually buy it, no I won't even click through to their website because of what it has become
