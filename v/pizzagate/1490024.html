            I just find it funny how this site opperated.  First time I've seen a service  that's meant to behave as an archive (other than history books) which actively actively 'curtails' what it's holding.  That's more dangerous IMO than just fake news.

             I provided the link to the live Washington Post article citing the tweets. Even if the tweets were manufactured, as you initially thought, it would be evidence then of "fake news" propagated by the MSM. Either way, providing this evidence is helpful in demonstrating the lie of the "fake news" narrative.

                that the tweets erased were about a side story on pizzagate.  I've seen too many stories based on tweets that an individual hasn't created in the first place, then ran as if they were.  Without an archived example of the tweet from the source I'm not to fond of taking the rest of the story at face value.  So, even if it was referenced in the article I still wouldn't believe it.  Just complete and utter ugh at the news these days.

                 I get it. The article itself showed the images of the tweets. I understand not trusting even that since it was WaPo. This is why I asked for someone to post the archives of the tweets, which someone kindly did:

            Our new leaders don't have power to do anything until Jan 20. Before that, Obama can preemptively pardon whom ever he wants, so don't expect any legal activity before the inauguration. 
I doubt Twitter is deleting Flynn's twitters. I think he must be doing that himself, perhaps in response to the mass MSM panic and censorship and to PREVENT obama from isssuing pardons. That is my gut instinct. On the other hand, our new leaders may decide to bury the story.

             Maybe. I am worried that they are actually be threatened by these evil people. Your theory makes perfect sense, so I hope you are right...about the first point in your post and not the last.
