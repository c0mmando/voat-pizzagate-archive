            By saying they are actual demons you DO IMPLY, that they are not doing wrong. 
Is a lion doing wrong when killing it's prey? Is a lion evil because he feeds on his prey?
Should we stop lions from killing their prey? NO NO NO

            Same we would have to say about demons if they would be real. If it's just their nature...
If this is just how the world works, then who are we to complain? If they are real, then this whole world is just an evil place and the demons are as guilty of being evil as a lion is and we would have as much right to complain as chickens have to complain about us eating them.

             “We of the Sirian Council - Washta, Mikah, and Teletron – wish to describe something about our own history as Galactic Humans and also about the organization called the Galactic Federation that Earth will soon be entering as a new Member.
            </p>
            <p>
             The Galactic Federation was formed about 4.5 million years ago to prevent the interdimensional Dark Forces from dominating and exploiting this Galaxy. This interdimensional Dark force had seeded the Milky Way Galaxy with its own kind of computer-like, cold-hearted Beings. Their appearance was mainly in the form of a Reptoid or a Dinoid individual. These Dark Beings spread across the Galaxy and began to successfully conquer thousands of Star Systems. These Reptoids/Dinoids, however, eventually reached an area of the Galaxy where free-willed sentient Human Beings had created several galactic civilizations which were their technological match.

            And he is so damn convinced that this is true, that he uploaded those hundrets ov vids in not even a year and that he keeps doing so even though he is fatally ill.
Look at his last video. He has to break after every single word to take a breath, but he is so convinced, that he is doing important channeling work to fight reptilian aliens together with the fed of light that he keeps going.
           </p>
           <p>
            Others claim "they" are astral demons from another dimension who controll people and live from peoples fear.
Others KNOW it is the devil who seduces people to do evil. 
Others certainly know, that those behind pizzagate are all jews and they do this because the thalmut tells them to do so.
           </p>
           <p>
            I could go on all day. I have met and talked to many people KNOWING all those things, but I KNOW there are in fact, no demons, no reptilian aliens on earth, no fed. of light, no astral demons from another dimension, no devil, no vampires, no werwolves and no, it's also not true, that all of this conspiracy is controlled only by jews- (i think, actually i can't know about this last thing)
           </p>
           <p>
            I actually whitnessed how people went crazy about their sleep paralysis/
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypnagogia">
             hypnagogia
            </a>
            experiences when they started believing they were visited by aliens at nighttimes and ended up in psychiatry.
While I my self was "visited by them" at nighttimes as well, I found the well documentated logical/ physiological/ psychological 
explanation for this and are totally fine now. As soon as I knew what was happening to me at night, it wasn't horrifying at all anymore. More like a hiccup.
           </p>
           <p>
            The insanity starts when you start believing it's real. I have seen many examples of this. 
People loosing connection to reality because they choose to believe in paranormal explanations for just natural occurrence like hypnagogia. That is exactly what happened to this reptile channeling guy.
           </p>
           <p>
            He isn't actually doing astral projections when he sleeps. What he is doing is called lucid dreaming.
But he doesn't know this, he thinks what he experiences while sleeping is real and this damaged his
perception of reality and this clears the way for insanity.
           </p>
           <p>
            I my self was "abducted by aliens" at nightimes when I was 18 (hypnagogia/ sleep paralysis)
and I even experienced things I really have no explanation for.
           </p>
           <p>
            But this doesn't stop me from being able to reenact at which point people who "know (they) are real" started to evolve a mental disorder due to the misinterpretation of natural occurrences.
           </p>
           <p>
            No single person of the hundrets I talked to about these things who "knew" they are real" didn't fail to prove they used impiracal logic to find out about what they "know" now, but all of them proved, that they for some reason just
           </p>
           <p>
            "WANT TO BELIEVE IT IS TRUE.
           </p>
           <p>
            But you are different right? You "KNOW" they are demons and everyone who calls vampires is wrong, everyone who calls aliens is wrong and I am wrong because I say they are just humans, right?
           </p>
           <p>
            I'm getting more and more convinced, that this is indeed part of their agenda.
           </p>
           <p>
            Making people believe they have actuall superpowers so we just understand our selfes as prey and respect and fear them and in the end have as much hope that we could fight them as chickens have hope they could fight us.
           </p>
           <p>
            And it is working great. You are actively working for them. gj!

            Maybe now after this comment you can reenact the points I tried to make a little better. People believe in actual superpowers, astral demons, demons, vampires and shit and this damages us and doesn't help at all (see reasons above). I never said it is bad to understand the history of the occult but that it is bad to believe there are actually any other living beings on this planet than animals, plants and mushrooms or that there are some supernatural hidden powers only the occult understands.
PPS: If any of those sentence sounds funny, I am not native english speaking.

            I don't doubt you interpret right what they are doing, why and how, but I see no good reason for us to call it "magic"
           </p>
           <p>
            It's psychology. 
You describe very well how it is just manipulation, yet you insist to better call it magic.
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             These people really do have "superpowers" -- powers beyond the mortal man, simply because they have banded together in concert to focus their magic in greater potency than individuals can.
            </p>
           </blockquote>
           <p>
            These people have manipulative skills-- skills beyond those of a single man, simply because they have banded together in concert to focus their manipulative skills in greater potency than individuals can.
           </p>
           <p>
            I don't see ANY reason why this sentence/ this view isn't the better one. It's the truth. Same sentence including magic isn't truth.
           </p>
           <p>
            There is no such thing as magic, so where is the benefit of using this word then instead of using the words which exactly describe what is really happening?
           </p>
           <p>
            I do understand how they think and also why it's working out so well for them, but I also know that it's ONLY different psychological effects responsible.
           </p>
           <p>
            Really, why does somebody who obv. understands the pure manipulative nature of their doings, use the same terms to describe their doings as they do, when it is obv. that those terms are only based in their insane, non scientiffic believes?
           </p>
           <p>
            They for example might believe Satan is real and drinking blood of babys gives them superwpowers.
           </p>
           <p>
            I know, for them it works, because the autosuggestive effect of believing it works (placebo) and also because of various other psychological effects.
           </p>
           <p>
            So when they tell me now it is magic, why would I say "Yes it's totally magic" when I know better?
           </p>
           <p>
            For them it makes no difference, but it could cunfuse other people and will probably cause that even less people understanding what is REALLY  happeneing or even worse, like implyed in my first post, people who see how good it works for those others would have good reason to start sacrifizing people as well.
           </p>
           <p>
            I for once know sacrifizing someone wouldn't give me much since, I know placebos wont work well if you know it's a placebo and I think it would be better if everybody would see it like this.
           </p>
           <p>
            From my point of view all this occult, magical, satanic, ritual stuff only exists, because people who first approached these things didn't understand, that what they experienced wasn't influenced by some kind of magical spirit but all had just to do with the nature of human mind. They just didn't understand that and I don't even blame them, because we had to analyze the human mind for thousands of years before we were able to explain these psychological effects and to understand how deep and complex the human mind is.But nowdays?
           </p>
           <p>
            But why would we want to keep this misinformation? We are currently watching what happens when people believe this shit.

            And because an insane person who probably eats children said something it's probably true?
           </p>
           <p>
            I don't get why SO MANY people actually believe this insane people have actaul superpowers.... "Because they said so"
           </p>
           <p>
            Those are the sickest people on the planet. And then people like you go and claim, they aren't actually sick but really get superpowers by practicing satanism, kinda reassuring them that they understand the world better than we do, thus aren't even doing wrong.
           </p>
           <p>
            I mean if the world really be like this, that you can have godlike powers when sacrifizing children and stuff, why would I even blame THEM? I would blame the world it self, but accept, that these people just do the "naturall" thing to do on this world.
           </p>
           <p>
            I guess that was part of their agenda as well. Making everyone believe they have actual superpowers or are actual demons, so we just accept them as our masters and feel that we have no chance fighting them.
And it works. At least 2 of 3 people here would confirm, that there are some "evil spirits" at work for sure.
           </p>
           <p>
            No there are no spirits, there is only insanity.

                Likewise, nothing was said about making him a POI. We started out with legitimate accusations of a connection, heavy alleged things, with you yourself alluding to 'some suspicious stuff' -- sufficient evidence was not produced.

                 I did not soften my position to save face.  If anything, you have softened your own position.  You started by outright denying this is worth pursuing.  I said I think there's plenty to pursue, and that's what I still say.

                If you think that's actionable evidence, you're going to be wasting a lot of time chasing ghosts on this thing. Hell, I ate a pizza, once reluctantly supported Hillary Clinton (a long time ago), and have babysat kids -- by your standards, you better toss me in the lineup too.

                I do agree with keeping eyes open and alert on this, but presenting OP's 'evidence' as... well, anything remotely reputable, is absurd.

                 That is a really bad comparison.  The links OP cited are much more significant.  We already suspect Clinton Foundation of child trafficking in Haiti.  Beyond Borders Haiti organization right near Comet/Besta/Terasol.  Misha Collins started an orphanage in Haiti, interned and campaigned with the Clintons, his first youtube post is a video joking about child abduction/molestation, wears a hat with a chicken (chickenlover?).  I'd say there's enough reason to keep digging.

            He's in for a shock either way. Either he's in on it and will get taken down, or was a true believer and good person who discovers he was helping monsters.

            The changeling thing is interesting. Had forgotten about their obsession with that imagery. If he mixes with that crowd he's going to be exposed to their secret language and ciphers whether conscious of it's real meaning or not.

            When actors make short films, it's likely that they're prepping to transfer over to directing gigs. In context of Supernatural I can see that sort of plot twist and set up being appropriate. Building tension, subverting expectations, use of make effects etc. Shows he can handle the basics.
           </p>
           <p>
            But the way things are going, nobody should be holding onto old loyalties for favorite shows and actors or holding famous people on any sort of pedestal.

            sli.mg is a decent image hosting site.  imgur works in a pinch too.  You can embed links into text by putting text between brackets and then the link in parentheses right after the closing bracket, without any space between the closing bracket and the opening parentheses.
           </p>
           <p>
            I also recommend using
            <a href="http://archive.is">
             http://archive.is
            </a>
            to link to pages, as well as providing a direct link when possible so that we can see the old page and the new page, just in case they try to pull a fast one by changing the page.

            i'm not saying he is, i'm saying he's connected to the clintons and to haiti with an orphanage there plus other circumstantial things that are linked to code words they use like "pizza" and "chicken". so it makes it creepy to me at this point. and i think people should be aware and do more research about him.

            Can you link and/or screenshot various bits of evidence?  It would really streamline the process.

           <p>
            This subvoat is getting inundated with random claims* that have no links to even circumstantial evidence.  Sure, we could follow up on what you say, but for the things that are outright false, that takes a
            <em>
             long time
            </em>
            to make sure they are false.  If you're the one to discover it, you really ought to be providing the evidence as well as making the claim.

            He doesn't provide any explanation for the information, but states it as fact.  How is anyone going to take us seriously if we just make outlandish claims?  (Which is exactly what they are, without evidence.)
