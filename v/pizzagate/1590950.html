<p>&quot;It was 1987. I had only started working in the film business the year before. Music videos were hugely popular at the time: both as a medium to watch, and for me, a bit of a dream on which to work. It was a Sunday morning when we started the shoot for this video. I believe it was at the now demolished SIR stage #3 in Hollywood. Andy Morahan was directing. I remember George\'s sister chasing George around the set yelling &quot;Yorgi, Yorgi!&quot; as she tried to get him to sit down so she could brush his hair. An hour before we were about to roll film there was a request from George to find a pearl necklace to thread through the epaulet on his jacket. I was given that task. Again, it was a Sunday morning at 7am. Not much in Hollywood is open at that time. I knew my job was going to be made or broken with this challenge: I would be a hero or a zero. After a bit of panic I happened by chance to wander into the gift shop of the local Catholic Church. Next to the crucifixes, Virgin Mary trinkets, and rosary beads, was...of all things, a beautiful pearl necklace. I returned to the stage and handed off the necklace to George\'s costumer. A few congratulatory pats on the back were given, then &quot;Action!&quot; A mere 28 hours later we were finished. I remember it like it was yesterday. RIP George. You led a life many would envy and many would condemn, but you made your mark in music history.</p>',
