<h1>I. The NCMEC</h1>
<p><strong>What is the NCMEC?</strong></p>
<p>This organization is the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children (NCMEC). See their web page here:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.missingkids.com/">http://www.missingkids.com/</a></p>
<p>The NCMEC  website says “In January 1984 NCMEC was incorporated by private individuals as a non profit corporation to serve as a national resource center and clearinghouse on issues related to missing and sexually exploited children.”</p>
<p>The term “private corporation” is key here. They do not have government oversight. This means they act as gate-keeper for the government to deal with child porn material without any oversight over what they’re doing, and law enforcement cannot get involved without them giving a go ahead.</p>
<p>NCMEC haven’t exactly been responsible in this oversight free role they are given either. They are in the middle of a law suit over their handling of child pornography constituting a violation of the Fourth Amendment:</p>
<p><a href="http://archive.is/TROdU">http://archive.is/TROdU</a></p>
<p>The details of the suit are as follows: AOL maintains a database of hash values assigned to images classified as child abuse so that they are more easily identified/tracked. AOL was simply sending NCMEC the images without bothering to open them and verify the contents. So NCMEC was violating the right to protection from undue searches and seizures by opening what AOL sent. Notice how in this instance, only NCMEC was aware of what the photo actually was (and think about how that could be used to keep a lid on information).</p>
<p>The NCMEC is significant mainly because of the oddly large number of connections it has. They appear to have some strong ties to Hollywood: Brian Cranston has been involved with them in the past and helped to make educational resources for them:</p>
<p><a href="http://archive.is/MiWnk">http://archive.is/MiWnk</a></p>
<p><strong>II. NCMEC Connections to Silsby and the “DC Group”</strong></p>
<p>Especially interesting is that the NCMEC has connections to both stories I have previously run concerning child sex trafficking.</p>
<p><strong>A. Laura Silsby</strong></p>
<p>Since being arrested in Haiti for trying to steal 33 children and getting let off the hook with the help of the Clinton’s, Silsby has moved on to inappropriately continue to work in the anti-human trafficking sector.  Silsby moved to Idaho and adoped the last name <strong>Gayler</strong>.  
</p>
<p>Silsby has moved on to work for a company called AlertSense which works with a number of US states on their alert systems, which include Amber Alerts.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.alertsense.com/industries/#government">https://www.alertsense.com/industries/#government</a></p>
<p><a href="http://archive.is/4eWSi">http://archive.is/4eWSi</a></p>
<p>Here is a local info webpage showing her working for AlertSense, as well as AlertSense’s main webpage showing that Silsby works on their Executive Team. Why would they let a woman convicted of trafficking children anywhere near systems that dealt with Amber Alerts?</p>
<p><a href="http://www.zoominfo.com/p/Laura-Silsby/-1978794537">http://www.zoominfo.com/p/Laura-Silsby/-1978794537</a></p>
<p><a href="http://archive.is/wka7C">http://archive.is/wka7C</a></p>
<p><a href="https://www.alertsense.com/company/executive-team/">https://www.alertsense.com/company/executive-team/</a></p>
<p><a href="http://archive.is/xFplZ">http://archive.is/xFplZ</a></p>
<p>And here is a less academic source covering Silsby’s move from a Haitian prison to AlertSense:</p>
<p><a href="http://rebrn.com/re/convicted-child-trafficker-works-for-company-responsible-for-amb-2942303/">http://rebrn.com/re/convicted-child-trafficker-works-for-company-responsible-for-amb-2942303/</a></p>
<p><a href="http://archive.is/kzAQS">http://archive.is/kzAQS</a></p>
<p>So how does this relate to the NCMEC? They are in charge of the Amber Alert program:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.missingkids.org/Amber">http://www.missingkids.org/Amber</a></p>
<p><a href="http://archive.is/91WBn">http://archive.is/91WBn</a></p>
<h1>III. NCMEC Connection to Alefantis/Brock</h1>
<p><strong>A. James Alefantis/David Brock/the “DC Group” Connections to Jeff Koons</strong></p>
<p>Remember how James Alefantis posted an “art” piece by Jeff Koons showing him having sex with what is purportedly his pornstar wife?</p>
<p><a href="https://i.sli.mg/IFs0bU.png">https://i.sli.mg/IFs0bU.png</a></p>
<p>It turns out that Jeff Koons is more to Alefantis than an artist he admires. To begin with, Koons is very involved with the DC/East Coast art scene.  
</p>
<p>Here on page 10 both Alefantis and Koons are mentioned as being involved in the DC art scene for example:</p>
<p><a href="http://digital.modernluxury.com/publication/?i=9965&amp;p=12">http://digital.modernluxury.com/publication/?i=9965&amp;p=12</a></p>
<p>But none of these circumstantial bits of evidence are as important as the discovery that <strong>Correct the Record paid Jeff Koons $50,000</strong> according to their SEC filing, seen here on page 9:</p>
<p><a href="http://docquery.fec.gov/pdf/318/201607159020655318/201607159020655318.pdf#navpanes=0">http://docquery.fec.gov/pdf/318/201607159020655318/201607159020655318.pdf#navpanes=0</a></p>
<p>Correct the Record is run by David Brock, who is in a relationship with James Alefantis. Here is a link confirming this and showing them caught up with another individual in some kind of blackmail love triangle:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2012/02/27/media-matters-boss-paid-former-partner-850g-blackmail-settlement.html">http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2012/02/27/media-matters-boss-paid-former-partner-850g-blackmail-settlement.html</a></p>
<p>Here is a photo of Brock on Alefantis\' Instagram:</p>
<p><a href="https://i.sli.mg/p58Eks.png">https://i.sli.mg/p58Eks.png</a></p>
<p><strong>B. Jeff Koons Work Connections to the NCMEC</strong></p>
<p>How is the connection to Koons Important? Koons is a board member of the International Center for Missing and Exploited Children (ICMEC). You can find an admission of that fact on his own web page:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.jeffkoons.com/biography-summary">http://www.jeffkoons.com/biography-summary</a></p>
<p><a href="http://archive.is/hfUS0">http://archive.is/hfUS0</a></p>
<p>The ICMEC was founded in 1998 by none other than the NCMEC:</p>

<p><a href="http://archive.is/zI508">http://archive.is/zI508</a></p>
<h1>IV. NCMEC Connections to Thorn and Hollywood</h1>
<p><strong>A. What is Thorn?</strong></p>
<p>The NCMEC investigation arose while I was looking in to an organization called Thorn. Thorn: Digital Defenders of Children (previously known as DNA) was founded by Hollywood personalities Ashton Kutcher and Demi Moore.  Wikipedia mentions that several other Hollywood stars support Thorn, and Brian Cranston (who also has worked with the NCMEC) has sponsored an event for them recently:</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thorn_(organization)">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thorn_(organization)</a></p>
<p><a href="http://archive.is/YKCJV">http://archive.is/YKCJV</a></p>
<p><a href="http://www.wearethorn.org/">http://www.wearethorn.org/</a></p>
<p><a href="http://archive.is/RL6Il">http://archive.is/RL6Il</a></p>
<p>One of the main services Thorn provides is creation of product (termed “SpotLight” and “Solis” for use on the clear and dark net respectively) that help with API, software which sifts through the material.</p>
<p>It does this sifting by scanning the hash symbols which were previously mentioned in this post (relevant to the case which landed the NCMEC in hot water for violating the Fourth Amendment). Thorn was involved with the creation of this hash symbol identification system.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.wearethorn.org/spotlight/">https://www.wearethorn.org/spotlight/</a></p>
<p><a href="http://archive.is/NYOZP">http://archive.is/NYOZP</a></p>
<p>Despite Thorns claim’s about the effectiveness of their software, they have only identified 6,325 victims and 2,186 traffickers. These numbers are quite a paltry drop in the pond when you consider the fact that over 800,000 children are reported missing each year:</p>
<p><a href="http://archive.is/RVFTn">http://archive.is/RVFTn</a></p>
<p><strong>B. Thorn\'s Connection to the NCMEC</strong></p>
<p>Thorn doesn’t just sell products to “help” combat child trafficking though, they also facilitate a meeting of various companies’ tech advisors in what is known as the Thorn Tech Task Force. Members of the Task Force include Google, Facebook, Microsoft, Twitter, Dropbox, Yahoo, Instagram, Tumblr, Imgur and Pinterest (many of whom were caught favoring the Clintons in the recent election).  Officially, Thorn merely provides this guideline for the Task Force and doesn’t take an official role.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.wearethorn.org/sound-practices-guide-stopping-child-abuse/">https://www.wearethorn.org/sound-practices-guide-stopping-child-abuse/</a></p>
<p><a href="http://archive.is/eVL08">http://archive.is/eVL08</a></p>
<p>Once the various representatives in the task force go back to work, they collaborate closely with the NCMEC. And they are working with the very hash system that got the NCMEC in hot water for Fourth Amendment violations. </p>
<p>Again, when their hash sharing system catches an image, it is shared only between the companies and the NCMEC. And the recent lawsuit the NCMEC is embroiled in indicates that the companies don’t even look at flagged images themselves. Think about how this could absolve them of liability while also ensuring that no one other than the NCMEC was able to view or access the flagged images.</p>
<p>The NCMEC, ICMEC and Thorn all need to be placed under more intense scrutiny and investigation given Thorn’s work with the NCMEC and the NCMEC’s association with AlertSense (where Silsby works) and Koons, who has associations with David Brock and his partner James Alefantis.</p>',

            A. James Alefantis/David Brock/the “DC Group” Connections to Jeff Koons
           </strong>
          </p>
          <p>
           Remember how James Alefantis posted an “art” piece by Jeff Koons showing him having sex with what is purportedly his pornstar wife?
          </p>

           </a>
          </p>
          <p>
           It turns out that Jeff Koons is more to Alefantis than an artist he admires. To begin with, Koons is very involved with the DC/East Coast art scene.
          </p>
          <p>
           Here on page 10 both Alefantis and Koons are mentioned as being involved in the DC art scene for example:

           </a>
          </p>
          <p>
           But none of these circumstantial bits of evidence are as important as the discovery that

            Correct the Record paid Jeff Koons $50,000

           according to their SEC filing, seen here on page 9:

           </a>
          </p>
          <p>
           Correct the Record is run by David Brock, who is in a relationship with James Alefantis. Here is a link confirming this and showing them caught up with another individual in some kind of blackmail love triangle:

           IV. NCMEC Connections to Thorn and Hollywood

          <p>
           <strong>
            A. What is Thorn?
           </strong>
          </p>
          <p>
           The NCMEC investigation arose while I was looking in to an organization called Thorn. Thorn: Digital Defenders of Children (previously known as DNA) was founded by Hollywood personalities Ashton Kutcher and Demi Moore.  Wikipedia mentions that several other Hollywood stars support Thorn, and Brian Cranston (who also has worked with the NCMEC) has sponsored an event for them recently:

          <p>
           One of the main services Thorn provides is creation of product (termed “SpotLight” and “Solis” for use on the clear and dark net respectively) that help with API, software which sifts through the material.
          </p>
          <p>
           It does this sifting by scanning the hash symbols which were previously mentioned in this post (relevant to the case which landed the NCMEC in hot water for violating the Fourth Amendment). Thorn was involved with the creation of this hash symbol identification system.
          </p>

          <p>
           Despite Thorns claim’s about the effectiveness of their software, they have only identified 6,325 victims and 2,186 traffickers. These numbers are quite a paltry drop in the pond when you consider the fact that over 800,000 children are reported missing each year:

           </strong>
          </p>
          <p>
           Thorn doesn’t just sell products to “help” combat child trafficking though, they also facilitate a meeting of various companies’ tech advisors in what is known as the Thorn Tech Task Force. Members of the Task Force include Google, Facebook, Microsoft, Twitter, Dropbox, Yahoo, Instagram, Tumblr, Imgur and Pinterest (many of whom were caught favoring the Clintons in the recent election).  Officially, Thorn merely provides this guideline for the Task Force and doesn’t take an official role.

          </p>
          <p>
           Once the various representatives in the task force go back to work, they collaborate closely with the NCMEC. And they are working with the very hash system that got the NCMEC in hot water for Fourth Amendment violations.
          </p>
          <p>
           Again, when their hash sharing system catches an image, it is shared only between the companies and the NCMEC. And the recent lawsuit the NCMEC is embroiled in indicates that the companies don’t even look at flagged images themselves. Think about how this could absolve them of liability while also ensuring that no one other than the NCMEC was able to view or access the flagged images.
          </p>
          <p>
           The NCMEC, ICMEC and Thorn all need to be placed under more intense scrutiny and investigation given Thorn’s work with the NCMEC and the NCMEC’s association with AlertSense (where Silsby works) and Koons, who has associations with David Brock and his partner James Alefantis.

            Hi guys, this could be an important part of this world wide paedophile ring.   Just noticed this sign near my home, with the international paedophiles symbol (like a triangle)     YWCA  Jesmond House, in Newcastle Upon Tyne, England (Clayton Road, Newcastle Upon Tyne NE2 1UJ )
            <br/>
            This building is in an affluent part of the city, and is a hostel that caters for vulnerable single people and recently released prisoners. Check out the symbol at the top of their web site
            <a href="http://www.neywca.co.uk/jesmond-house.php">
             http://www.neywca.co.uk/jesmond-house.php
            </a>
            Interestingly this place was opened by H.R.H. Princess Alexandrea on 27 sept 1984
This is the sign I seen from the street

            Hope someone with more know-how then me be able to dig some more, little children could be at risk now.Thank you.
I would also like to thank Victurus Libertas VL, for recently making this video about this matter

            This organization seems to be a big player given their members' "connections" to various things.

            Can you dig up links from around the web on the whole twitter pedo thing that happened in the last week? Specifically anything the Twitter admins or higher ups might have said about "doxxing." The more respectable/academic the better. Anything the Reddit admins said about doxxing in relation to the Twitter thing would be appreciated as well.

            Unrelated to pizzagate, a lot of the "kids" in the refugee populations are not kids. They're fighting age males.

            You would have to ask the Pizzagate jackass that left the comment. The comment was left after the harassment had started. Is this an example of what a good investigator/researcher you are?

            John Walsh (America's Most Wanted host) is listed as a co-founder of NCMEC. His son, Adam, was  kidnapped and murdered in the early 80's. His body was never found, only bis head. Considering  everything  we've learned since the pizzagate story broke, perhaps he should be looked at more closely as well.

            I saw that photo on the jimmycomet Instagram feed (without the Black box obscuring the graphic parts).  The female being penetrated DOES NOT look like a fully developed woman, much less a porn star.  To me she looks decidedly underaged.  The proportions are smallish and there is no pubic hair.  Hideous!  These people are sick motherfuckers

            I'm not at all concerned for you. I'm just telling you why most people dismiss you as lunatics and liars. It's not because they're sheep or because they're pedos or because they're paid off. It's because you are incapable of or unwilling to differentiate between facts, guesses, theories, and complete bullshit. When you "present your case" and the very first item is shit, why would anyone bother to read the rest?

            The very "protectors" without any oversight are the "assaulters" GD...what a wicked, wicked, filthy rot we've uncovered with all of this. I swear I will not stop until all of this slime is uncovered and exposed in the brightest of all sunlight for everyone to see. I don't publicly express appeals to deity very often, but dear God of us all, please help us yank out this root of wickedness that has so forcefully anchored itself inside of our country preying upon the weakest. Please waken the rest of our citizens to this thinly veiled putrefaction lurking within our midst. May Thy providence shine upon all those of us who strive to right these wrongs and free these Innocents from their captors and prisons that they may feel Thy love and the love of their protective Brothers and Sisters and know that there is still hope. At this time of Thanksgiving, we offer our gratitude that we've been sufficiently startled to a recognition of our duty to restore Thy favor through liberation of Thy little ones. Praise to the truth. Praise to freedom. Praise to all that is good and holy :'(

            Other people being pedophiles does not mean that all children's organizations are secret pedo rings. Do you understand that?
           </p>
           <p>
            Do you understand how ridiculous it is to say that someone working with an organization that exists ostensibly to fight child trafficking should therefore be suspected of being a child trafficker? Do you understand how this kind of "logic" is exactly why most people immediately dismiss all the theories coming out of forums like this one?

            Not really. As it keeps being asked :
           </p>
           <p>
            "J'aime l'enfant" would literally mean : I love (or I like) the child". In fact the sentence doesn't sound natural French unless you know that a guy named "Pierre Charles L'Enfant" was the civil engineer who designed the lay-out of the streets of Washigton D.C.
As always those weirdoes squeeze in existing patterns. So there is a L'Enfant Plaza, and a trendy bar by that name in D.C.
           </p>
           <p>
            French for "I love children" would have to be "J'aime les enfants."
           </p>
           <p>
            All that doesn't make the instagram photo and comments less insane looking.
           </p>
           <p>
            Congrats to OP, although I have no time to get in the details.

             "J'aime l'enfant" is the same as "J'aime les enfants." L'enfants is just a contraction of les enfants just as J'aime is a contraction of Je aime.

             <p>
              Sorry, no. "J'aime" is a contraction for "Je aime".
             </p>
             <p>
              "Je" ends with a vowel and "aime" begins with one. The contraction follows a rule in French usage called "élision" : when it doesn't sound euphonic the first vowel is changed to an apostrophy.
             </p>
             <p>
              So singular article "Le", cannot be "le enfant" but becomes "l'enfant". But plural article is "Les" ending with a consonant so there is no need for an elision but the ending "s" pronouciation is hardened to "z" with no change in writing.
             </p>
             <p>
              I cannot think of an example in French where this rule of euphony with two vowels would not apply in speech if not in writing.
             </p>
             <p>
              Still, posting this picture of a guy wearing a "J'aime l'enfant" (I love the child) T-shirt in what seems like a wild homo party doesn't sound innocent. Like the rest of the Instagram posts. James Alefantis must sound pretty close to "J'aime les enfants" to an American ear. Not so much to a French ear, although it is almost an anagram, and is close enough to be joked about.
             </p>
             <p>
              Sorry if I'm not as clear as I'd like.

            He describes a bunch of orgs that are involved with missing kids and stuff and implies that they are somehow on the other side of that situation than they profess to be, without a lick of evidence or really any hint of wrongdoing.

            Yes. There is plausible deniability though, in that there's a popular cafe they go to called L'enfant Cafe &amp; Bar. That's also where the Boum Boum Room is. It's an event they hold at the cafe with adult entertainment.

            Could they use this system to propogate CP? Could the images become a menu of sorts? I don't know anything about embedded hash marks, but could they be placed in certain for sale children? This kind of evil is unfathomable.

            800.000 missing children is not entirely correct. "Only" (more than one child is stil too much) 115 out of them were serious abductions. Majority were false alarms.

            For some reason none of this is surprising. Let's stand by and watch the system crumble.

            This is the real sort of work that needs to be done around here.  I don't think the Podesta emails are where we're going to find anything.  I honestly don't believe the Podesta emails really show anything incriminating, aside from the spirit cooking.
           </p>
           <p>
            I think the big bits of evidence in this case are the works of art, the symbols of the businesses, and things like what OP has here.  I spent hours reading the Podesta emails.  Those emails about food are, in my opinion, legitimately about food.  And if they're not, there's no way he'd say anything incriminating over email, so looking there feels like a waste of time.

            We really need to demand any CIA operations involving US citizens be revealed. Go figure, John Brennan went to Fordham. A jesuit school. First school Trump went to also before leaving. There is no doubt in my mind Trump at a minimum knows whats going on. We should really shift focus from Comet to these to groups. Comet is already trying to cover up and is probably laying low. It wouldn't have the same effect as these two groups being dismantled. We can't have a group with no government oversight in charge of missing children. We put Trump in office. This is the peoples country again. #StayWoke

           <p>
            You say Clintons, what did Hillary do for Silsby to "get her off the hook"? For that matter what exactly did Bill do?

             Why would they let a woman convicted of trafficking children anywhere near systems that dealt with Amber Alerts?

           <p>
            She wasn't convicted of trafficking children.

           <blockquote>
            <p>
             But none of these circumstantial bits of evidence are as important as the discovery that Correct the Record paid Jeff Koons $50,000 according to their SEC filing, seen here on page 9:
            </p>
           </blockquote>
           <p>
            This is a receipt FROM Koons, i.e. a contribution from Koons to CTR, not a payment TO Koons.
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             Correct the Record is run by David Brock, who is in a relationship with James Alefantis.
            </p>
           </blockquote>
           <p>
            WAS in a relationship with Alefantis.
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             It turns out that Jeff Koons is more to Alefantis than an artist he admires.
            </p>
           </blockquote>
           <p>
            You haven't really established this. Koons donated $50k to Correct the Record in 2016, Alefantis used to go out with Brock who runs CTR.
           </p>
           <p>
            And just for the record, Koons isn't just some guy in the East Coast art scene. His pieces sell for tens of millions of dollars, in fact he has the all-time record for highest sale price of a work by a living artist  ($58 million).

            People might want to tighten up their statements and try to remove bias if you want to be taken seriously.

               Prior to their involvement the Haitian court was treating the charges against the Americans more seriously as per the numerous articles on the case. Clinton, Secretary at the time, had just months prior created one of the main Haiti relief funds along with Bush. To the Haitians at that point it would have been seen as crucial for their country's support. The Clintons then, having been following the events decided to step in diplomatically with regard to the Silsby case, as has been reported, and all but one of the Americans were released bar Silsby whose charges were dramatically and questionably reduced. As I've more thoroughly laid out in the previous reply the trafficking aspect and ultimate intent wasn't resolved yet following Clinton's involvement it was all but hand-waved away.
              </p>
              <p>
               Either you can continue to believe that Clinton, despite reports, didn't in fact make any difference to the case, or you can look at what occurred and see that clearly there was a change that affected the charges brought against and final consequences of the group. I'm also not going to continue replying to things I've already outlined in previous replies.

                Many cases if not the majority (at least involving white people, especially well-off white people) have charges reduced between the initial arrest and final sentencing.

                Bill was asked by the UN to be a special envoy to Haiti during the crisis, he didn't get sent over by Hillary to rescue her pedo trafficking buddy. He supposedly was somehow involved in getting the others involved released, although I can find little or no actual evidence for this (there seems to be exactly one article about this and its text does not support its headline), and in any case everyone seems to agree that those others did not know what was going on.
               </p>
               <p>
                Silsby got a light sentence because the parents said they had given their children over voluntarily, not because of anything Bill did. I have seen no suggestion anywhere that Bill's involvement had anything to do with Silsby's sentencing.

               <p>
                " Judge Bernard Saint-Vil explained
that his decision was based on the Haitian parents’ testimony that they had
“[given] their kids away voluntarily.”75 Similarly, defense lawyer Jorge
Puello stated that the missionaries “willingly accepted kids they knew were
not orphans because the parents said they would starve otherwise.”76 Another
trial attorney for the missionaries, Aviol Fleurant, argued that “[t]he
parents’ testimony means no law was broken and ‘we can’t talk any more
about trafficking of human beings.’”"

              Those emails show zero suspicious "connection" between Hillary and Laura. Of course the Secretary of State's staff at the Department of State forwarded her a couple emails about American citizens being held for crimes in another country. The only other emails were generic spam press releases forwarded to Hillary.

              This is what I'm talking about, when you guys talk about Hillary and Silsby being "connected", once someone looks up those actual emails they will immediately dismiss anything you have to say because of your extreme distortion of the facts.

               We do know Bill Clinton intervened. We also know that there was a solid case against Bill Clinton associate Jeffrey Epstein for international child trafficking, but after extreme machinations his charges were significantly reduced to soliciting and he was placed on essentially home arrest in his mansion. (The sourcing on the solid case of child trafficking is outlined by Conchita Sarnoff in "TrafficKing" and in numerous video interviews she has given that are available online).

                Despite evidence of association with child traffickers,5 the Haitian justice system—prodded in part by President Clinton’s diplomatic efforts on behalf of the missionaries—determined that none of the missionaries were guilty of illegal activities, except the leader Laura Silsby, who faced a lesser charge of organizing illegal travel.

               I was establishing the history of the event. You asked about Bill Clinton's involvement and I gave you an answer, proving some context. I'm not "you guys." I knew more about the case and was proving some details.

              <p>
               The intentions of Silsby and the entire group were never properly resolved in the case. They had obtained the children on verbal promises to the parents of a 'better life' yet none of the group's facts checked out regarding both their organization nor the claimed orphanage, and were trying to leave the country with no authorization, something Silsby had attempted to do so previously.
              </p>
              <p>
               Important issues regarding child trafficking were
               <a href="http://www.france24.com/en/20100122-children-missing-hospitals-earthquake-trafficking-haiti-unicef">
                reported by Unicef
               </a>
               at the time following the earthquake. By
               <a href="https://www.unicef.org/infobycountry/haiti_58029.html">
                their statistics
               </a>
               at least 2,000 children were trafficked from Haiti to the Dominican Republic in 2009 alone. Haiti was experiencing a crisis with this at a time of immense vulnerability and trafficking networks were exploiting it. And in the middle there is the case of Silsby and her group who were trying to take a total of 100 children away to the Dominican Republic, under a fake organization that the US could find no filings for to a non-existent orphanage, for unclear purposes that were never properly established during their Haiti case and whose original American-Dominican legal adviser was arrested during this time for being part of a Haitian child trafficking network himself.
              </p>
              <p>
               The Clintons become involved with the case around this time and the charges against the rest of the group were dropped due to the group's claim of being 'unaware' of Silsby's true intentions, making Silsby out to be the brainchild of the operation. Silsby ultimately received a mere 3 months sentence for 'organizing illegal travel' only due to the defense successfully arguing the case that parents having voluntarily given their children to them was enough—and only because of this single reason. She faced up to 15 years in prison. The trafficking aspect was never addressed.

                It sounds like Silsby may have been up to something, but the court apparently ultimately decided that the parents had in fact given her the kids and thus they at least concluded it was not as nefarious as many here insist. In any case, Silsby being up to something does not in any way, shape, or form implicate the Clintons or Koons or Alefantis or Brock or any of the children's orgs mentioned in OP.

                 Yes. It does implicate the Clintons, because she emailed the Clinton Foundation in order to receive help in her court case. Seeing all of the other evidence which we have found, they were the likely recipients of the children. But that's all heresay. If you don't believe any of it, why are you here? Don't waste your time with a bunch of crazy people. Amirite? XP. Found the shill.

                   I don't agree with your characterization of "nearly all of you". But I welcome your criticism. People should be challenged to establish their claims and source them with facts.

              This is from time back - still, it's good to air again.
             </p>
             <p>
              Truth is the current Prime Minister of the UK, Theresa May, was in charge of the investigation into high-level establishment child abuse as Home Secretary.  She managed to select 3 Chairpersons for the case who all had to resign for various scandals and shady reasons - they are now on to the fourth Chair.  Many of the lawyers involved have resigned.  Much of the evidence collected from the victims has gone missing/been lost.  And apart from a couple of fairly famous TV/radio and entertainment personalities being convicted Brexit has taken everyone's minds off the issue.

             Shit its the same in europe. In a case which involved a pedophile named Dutroux in Belgium - he claimed to be part of an elite circle - the judge didn t believe him.
**
During the court process 23 people died **who wanted to help to clear the case. Search for it, if interested.

             Probably murdered by the power pedo elite.

              Yep one of them even "committed suicide" by shooting himself 2 times lethally in the head with a pistol. Here's a good documentary about the deaths and other weird shit that happened during the case. I suggest watching all 3 parts, it's a good red pill even for normies and makes it pretty clear that it was covered up by some very powerful people.

The ill conceived operation ran into problems of legality, infighting between different factions representing Dems/Reps each looking to score political points with their humanitarian efforts by claiming credit, and there was the fact that 10 children we're not on the official adoption list at all. In fact, they were not even orphans.

             Wow. Amazing work. I'm new to VOAT but I share this work on gab.ai to show people how deep it goes.
NO one is as diligent as all of you, and this item is ..insanely informative and scary at the same time. As someone once victim to child molestation, i know they have networks, tricks and grooming games. 
Thank you for sharing all that you do. If it saves kids, it is all worth it.

              I second this. Great to see you here Yiff! We talked briefly on reddit about the potential connections to all the charities but I had another username over there.
Keep up your outstanding work! And if you need some manpower, just call for it. Best regards sir!

               Thanks, I will be asking for people's help with some stuff pretty soon. A couple new leads developed within the last few days which we need to pursue zealously.

               Pretty sure Reddit will slap it down immediately when I post it there because it implicates some of their admins.

               I'm happy to try my hand at it but being the main mod is quite time consuming. Not sure if I would be able to do a sufficient job.

                Being a mod on Voat is less time consuming than being a mod on plebbit. Here the only stuff you really have to scrub is CP, otherwise the community decides with up and downvoats. On plebbit you are expected to curate everything where here the communitu should mass downvoat the spam. You doing research is top priority though, focus on that for now before you decide.

                If it takes away from your research, dont bother. There are far more important things. We need people on the front lines. The people will moderate, we know about JTRIG. Only truth matters

                but I'd think you'd be a better mod, even if you dont  do it fulltime. He even said he'd be a shitty mod.
