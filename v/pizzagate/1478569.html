<p><a href="https://voat.co/user/kingkongwaswrong">@kingkongwaswrong</a></p>
<p><strong>This sub is filled with CTR bots.</strong></p>
<p>I have figured out how they work.  It\'s not so easy to explain, feel free to ask questions, you might have to re-read this a few times before you can go &quot;ahh haa&quot;. I will break it up into three parts.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>First, I will present a very obvious example</strong> The thread in question can be seen here: </p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1476934">https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1476934</a></li>
</ul>
<p>The actual post content is questionable, but that is another matter. I believe bots can attach to non-CTR posts as well, so the content of the OP does not matter so much for my case here. You can read my comments on the actual post content here (sort by \'bottom\' and my comment is most downvoated, lol)</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1476934/7163661">https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1476934/7163661</a></li>
</ul>
<p>So... the CTR original poster - \'reasonedandinformed\' (classic appeal to authority psyop) posts. Then presses &quot;play&quot; for a bot conversation to get comments up, and walks away.</p>
<p>Open this screencap now so you can follow my logic...</p>
<p><a href="https://sli.mg/N3vPmY">https://sli.mg/N3vPmY</a></p>
<p>Problem is in this instance, one of the comments at the start (Evidenceforthings) was complaining about an earlier comment (lawfag123) being downvoted, when the comment in question was not actually downvoted. Several legit human accounts (fireabend, onegin) noticed this and replied. <a href="https://voat.co/user/fireabend">@fireabend</a> even posted a screencap here <a href="https://sli.mg/xjXUYj">https://sli.mg/xjXUYj</a> A glitch in the matrix was observed. I saw this myself a few hours after these other guys noticed.</p>
<p>And who comes along to explain the glitch? Not any of the alleged bot posters that the questioners where actually addressing, but the human supervisor account, the OP - reasonedandinformed. The explaination was that one of the \'bots\' was not refering to a voat post, but one from reddit/self. Complete BS excuse.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Second: How the bots work</strong></p>
<p>The CTR strategy is this; they have sets of prewritten \'conversations\' between the bot accounts, a real person has to hit the \'play\' button, and also monitor it for any non-bot activity that they can later respond to if needed. When the original post is from CTR, the conversation makes sense, it is related to the original post. </p>
<p>But when the OP is from a real person and CTR does not have a response written up already, they play something semi-related, probably find something from keywords or in line with one of their strategies (strategy examples: disinfo, racist violent redneck, conspiricy nutter, sexist men, bible basher etc.). This results in a post with entire threads of conversation only tentatively related to the OP. It looks strange. Here is an example; <a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1476125">https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1476125</a> The post is about the CIA planning a coup on Donald Trump to cover up pizzagate. The top reply, and replies to that reply are about \'Jesus\' and do not relate to the original post at all. Another glitch in the CTR bot matrix.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Third topic... The controlled overthrow of LegionWill</strong></p>
<p>I have had my eye on LegionWill for some time. I started by simply calling this account out (where is your source.. etc), then eventually gathered a big list of BS he posted. CTR was watching and could see I was going to destroy him. In the back of my mind I thought they would \'throw him under the bus\' in order to maintain credibility of their bot army.</p>
<p>I wrote up a well sourced post why LegionWill is a CTR shill, and posted it on one of his threads <a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1473609/7142307">https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1473609/7142307</a> . Immediately, another account came in to support me <a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1473609/7143128">https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1473609/7143128</a>. I even replied to this saying how amazing the timing was, and that it makes it look like we are coordinating. This account was \'reasonedandinformed\'. Reasonedandinformed was controlled opposition. They helped me by providing proof of a forged screenshot of kingkongwaswrong on reddit. They had the screenshot because they made the screenshot.  All of a sudden it looked like the whole \'community\' was on my side. Exactly what I was expecting from a controlled opposition bot army. So I made a new post here hinting at that, titled &quot;LegionWill thrown under the bus by his own shill army&quot; - <a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1474104">https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1474104</a></p>
<p>After LegionWill was gone, it was almost like he was still there. Posts on \'hot\' had all the hallmarks of his postings. But the posts were now made under username \'reasonedandinformed\'. They are just as poorly sourced rubbish as LegionWill was posting before, and upvoated like crazy. </p>
<hr />
<p>In summary, I believe this sub is infested with bots. And the only way I think we can beat them is to figure out who the legitimate accounts are, not who the shills are, because there are far too many shills.</p>',

He is unwilling to look at the facts, which to me confirms that he cannot be trusted as a source for anything.

            exposes you as CTR. I proved LegionWill was a shill from his own history, fabricating a document to frame our Mod. The fact that you keep going after him shows how much you want to stop this investigation. You also defend BlueBerryPie, someone who just joined this investigation 6 hours ago to once again throw up disinformation. Someone is either CTR or stupid when the lead is: Andrew Kline, owner of Besta Pizza and with the DOJ..."

           <p>
            This has been fully debunked. There are two Andrew Kline's that are attorneys in DC, with the first one being the person tied to Besta Pizza:

            I am pasting my thoughts on identifying real shills here: The key patterns: 1. Heavy caution at a new, possibly promising, lead. This is different than asking for documentation of a CLAIM. This guy was pushing back hard on somebody's finding of possible others connected to Tony Podesta in his FB friends based on questionable posts. 2. Smoking gun or exaggerated claims without evidence, which contradicts point #1. When you see both happening, you know it is a shill (versus someone just being over zealous) since it shows radically-inconsistent analysis. 3. Planting ideas that seem to be ludicrous, disconnected, or fringe, with no support, so that they can build the narrative of fake news by pointing to nonsense threads. When these unsubstantiated ideas fly up with heavy upvotes, you know it is CTR. They use this to move our resources into dead ends or areas that make us look silly...while replacing legit threads by moving to the top of the board. 4. Showing heavy venom and hate, bigotry, etc., again to partially paint us as a lunatic fringe of white supremacist racists (another of their memes). They loving pulling in hatred of jews or other groups. 5. Inciting violence or a call to arms to go down to the place and give them justice. They play off our natural outrage to try to create a record of us calling for violence, which will support their narrative when they have the false flag op and blame us for the violence, calling for outright censorship.

             @reasonedandinformed
            </a>
            is simply that an account commented complaining about a supportive comment being downvoted, which had not actually been downvoted?  I can think of a couple other explanations for that.  One, it could be a frame-up to create drama and distraction.  Two, and more likely,
            <strong>
             it is definitely plausible the account complaining about downvoting was talking about other threads on the topic being downvoted
            </strong>
            .  I just don't see any evidence here worthy of the accusation.  Feel free to go through the user's history and try to find evidence, but for now, I'm flairing this "Accuracy in question."
           </p>
           <p>
            Edit: Looked at
            <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/user/Evidenceforthings">
             @Evidenceforthings
            </a>
            ' account.  Looks pretty human to me.
           </p>
           <p>
            Edit 2:  OK, it's been 3 hours and I still haven't received adequate evidence of bots or of reasonedandinformed's alleged shilling.  As this could be a CTR tactic to create discord and distraction, I'm changing flair from "accuracy in question" to "debunked" until such times as real evidence is provided.

             This whole post was a buch of crap. The reference to my post being down voted was in relation to the third paragraph of my original post that was cited, where i mentioned that my post on Reddit had been down voted. People just have to read it to see that. This entire post was a CTR operation.

             reasonedandinformed magically produced proof (screencap) of legionwill framing kingkongwashere at the exact same time I called legionwill out with a pile of proof. It was a controlled effort to sacrifice legionwill to protect the ctr bot operation.
            </p>
            <p>
             reasonedandinformed current posts look identical to what legionwill was posting. Massive upvoats. No real substance. Duplicated topics. Bot accounts replying. Huge upvotes and comment activity.

               And you are replying to me like you have not even read what I posted. Like it is completely normal to say "oh why was that downvoted" in relation to a post on a totally different forum! What absolute bullshit!

                I don't know if you're a shill or just trigger-happy, but you have provided no real evidence of shilling by the user you're accusing.  You are attacking a user who makes a lot of submissions, yet you can't even point to a single submission as evidence of shilling?  This makes me question why you're attacking this user.

                 Lock out other mods, or just revoke permissions temporarily so they can't interfere. Don't tell mods when test will be run so they can't turn the bots off.
Write some test posts. This will find the existence of hundreds of bots here. Refer to this post and the tests this guy has run.

                   I'm not saying mods are running bots.

                  <p>
                   I am saying this forum is infested with bots. An isolation test needs to be done. This means isolating mod influence and having a blind test at unannounced time, to be sure that a mod is not interfering.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   There has already been interference with cleaning up of bot posts on this very thread, suggesting a compromised mod *edit.. or bot manager fixing bots gone crazy.

                    Not sure what you want me to do? We have very limited 'technical' functions available to us. Prettty much just deleting and flairing actually - we can't edit existing posts or comments or anything.

                      Post new topic. SaneGoatiSwear can probably suggest some good tests and keywords, he seems to know how bots work.

                     <li>
                      Reply to the new topic with the test accounts, get some activity on the thread to attract bots.

                      Reply also to some of the more rubbish posts on 'new' and see what happens
                     </li>
                     <li>
                      Wait for bots to arrive.
                     </li>
                     <li>
                      Try to have a conversation with the bots.
                     </li>
                    </ol>
                    <p>
                     Problem is you can't let the bot operators know when the test is happening or the details of the test, they will just clean it up. See my screenshot and post linked above for what I mean by cleanup. Maybe it's best you do the test on your own at a random time.

             That is what CTR tries to do. Just ignore this crap and ridiculous theory. There is CTR, but it has always been humans inventing crap, and it is usually pretty obvious if you just look at the patterns and/or history of the person.

            About every other time I refresh a page or return to the Hot list etc on Voat, I am asked to prove I am not a bot. Does that not apply to everyone? I have to click to say I'm not a bot and then select which pictures out of a group have a house, or street sign, or a shop front. It's annoying, but I thought the point was to ensure that bots can't comment here?

            Those protecting the pedos think they are Pantons , but they are not. They wear their fancy red shoes, but are "down at the heel" horse - fuckers when reality shows up. They have to lie and cheat to win. No other way. They can be "last man standing" but will still be losers.

            I copied here verbatim my exposure of LegionWill:
WARNING: This guy is a proven shill. See:
            <a href="https://sli.mg/T74Oad">
             https://sli.mg/T74Oad
            </a>
            I exposed him yesterday as he was concern trolling in a legitimate post from someone who had started digging into the FB friends of Tony Podesta (see
            <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/v/pizzagate/1472300">
             https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1472300))
            </a>
            )). He goes from being concerned about speculation to wild speculation with massive headlines. Whenever he posts things, they rocket up quickly (a sign of CTR shilling). I then decided to dig into his history. Look at this post that he made, attacking our Mod:
            <a href="http://i.sli.mg/IfONLk">
             http://i.sli.mg/IfONLk
            </a>
            If you look at the date when Reddit was banned, 11/22 @ 4 pm, you can see that LegionWill manufactured this false evidence against our moderator kingkongiswrong, as the dates are after Reddit banned pizzagate. He thinks we are stupid...or he is incredibly inept:
            <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/5edmbs/rpizzagate_is_being_admin_banned_today_at_400/">
             https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/5edmbs/rpizzagate_is_being_admin_banned_today_at_400/
            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            Just compare his record to mine, and you will see he is doing all he can to try to derail us and infiltrate.
           </p>
           <p>
            This shill from CTR takes us for fools. Disregard anything he posts and expose him as the CTR shill. Down vote, if you can, anything he has to say. He needs to be removed.

            People...they are trying very hard to fight and distract us. Don't let it happen. Follow your gut, but look at people's histories if you want to make or support accusations. I have been one of the most-ardent people trying to help and have successfully exposed several virus-like CTR shills. Just look at my history.

             So this got downvoted twice, meaning two shills (OP is definitely one) or just stupidity going in this thread. Before reacting to something like this, please look at the evidence contained (or lack thereof), especially people's history.
            </p>
            <p>
             I am pasting my thoughts on identifying real shills here:
The key patterns: 1. Heavy caution at a new, possibly promising, lead. This is different than asking for documentation of a CLAIM. This guy was pushing back hard on somebody's finding of possible others connected to Tony Podesta in his FB friends based on questionable posts. 2. Smoking gun or exaggerated claims without evidence, which contradicts point #1. When you see both happening, you know it is a shill (versus someone just being over zealous) since it shows radically-inconsistent analysis. 3. Planting ideas that seem to be ludicrous, disconnected, or fringe, with no support, so that they can build the narrative of fake news by pointing to nonsense threads. When these unsubstantiated ideas fly up with heavy upvotes, you know it is CTR. They use this to move our resources into dead ends or areas that make us look silly...while replacing legit threads by moving to the top of the board. 4. Showing heavy venom and hate, bigotry, etc., again to partially paint us as a lunatic fringe of white supremacist racists (another of their memes). They loving pulling in hatred of jews or other groups. 5. Inciting violence or a call to arms to go down to the place and give them justice. They play off our natural outrage to try to create a record of us calling for violence, which will support their narrative when they have the false flag op and blame us for the violence, calling for outright censorship.

              Why would you accuse me of being a BOT? Why did you plant a red-herring about me, someone who clearly is working to get to the truth, which is international in nature?
             </p>
             <p>
              The premise of your post was that this comment in response to my post (
              <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/v/pizzagate/1476934">
               https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1476934)
              </a>
              ) did not make sense:
             </p>
             <p>
              "Problem is in this instance, one of the comments at the start (Evidenceforthings) was complaining about an earlier comment (lawfag123) being downvoted, when the comment in question was not actually downvoted. Several legit human accounts (fireabend, onegin) noticed this and replied."
             </p>
             <p>
              The person was literally directly responding to my actual post, if you bothered to read it. The first two sentences of the third paragraph of my actual post are pasted here for you and all to see:
"
              <strong>
               My post about this MSM-censorship fact on Reddit was downvoted by some people!
              </strong>
              Who would downvote this explosive exposure of media censorship?"
             </p>
             <p>
              So you basically showed that someone took the time to read my actual full post and responded to a particular item I raised, but you did not even bother to read this, did you?
             </p>
             <p>
              You also claimed that I invented the evidence against LegionWill. I pasted it directly from his own history. He had literally fabricated the item and was so stupid as to time stamp it days after Reddit shut down our investigation.
             </p>
             <p>
              If you are really searching for the truth, you need to apologize for falsely accusing me and somehow retract this. Otherwise, it is obvious that you are a CTR shill.

               I'll try again. Who are the "two people dedicated to bringing justice who are being named as CTR"?  Or do you lack comprehension of your own words. Two usernames... that's all I am asking for.

                  I don't have time to chase down shills, but so far I have been pretty good at spotting them. From your intro,
                  <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/user/fireabend">

                  would look very suspect, assuming that you are not CTR. You need to correct the record as I am obviously on the good side of this.

                 is a shill according to you, is that he responded on the weird comment re: 'omg why are you getting downvoted' and linked it to something he was experiencing on reddit. Can you elaborate as I wasn't 100% sure this was hard evidence this guy is a shill, unless I'm missing something.

                 can you please explain why you shared that link to reddit? I didnt understand why you posted it or what you were trying to say. It did seem weird in context as you linked to a post rather than a comment, and why would what happens in reddit be relevant to voting mechanics here?
                </p>
                <p>
                 If any of you are shills, I suggest... considering if this really is what you want to be pouring your energy into, and consider how it is affecting your life peripherally. I can guarantee you that there is a better life out there if you just let go.

                  Just read his thread from yesterday and read my response. It was ridiculous. Look at the history. His post claimed that people were responding about my post (
                  <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/v/pizzagate/1476934">
                   https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1476934)
                  </a>
                  ) being downvoted without any reason. They were responding to the first 2 sentences of the 3rd paragraph. JUST READ MY POST. End of story. The whole post was insane, and I am not sure if duff needs to take a break or is CTR, but his claims were debunked by my responses and a look at my history. I do not have time to waste on this crap.

                  It doesn't really matter 'who is the shill'. That is a diversion. A shill can just delete an account and start again.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  What matters here is the sub is infested with bots.  I would say there are more bots than humans here. And yeah, you probably have comprimized mods supervising, I've seen flairing patterns that look like they are supporting the bots. I also note that since yesterday they have adjusted their algorithms to have less upvoting on top posts. Absolute rubbish comments that have next to no relevence to the thread were being upvoted by bots like crazy - read my OP point 2, they have toned it down now so it is not so obvious.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  Example of bot on this very thread:
                  <a href="http://sli.mg/StBfBG">
                   http://sli.mg/StBfBG
                  </a>
                  <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/v/pizzagate/1478569/7172373">
                   https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1478569/7172373
                  </a>
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  But sure.. maybe that was actually me faking bot activity or dummying up a screencap. I've got more screencaps of weird bots, but there is no point me sending them. It has already been suggested by one of your mods that I faked them.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  That's why you gotta do a bot test. And I would love to help out with that, but as the whistleblower I can't. I urge you please... make some test accounts and try. Don't announce it to anyone. Don't announce the results. Repeat the tests a few times over a period of time.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  I'm not talking about reasonedandinformed anymore. Really, one account doesn't matter when there is an army of bots making everyones genuine contributions on this thread difficult.

             i asked him to put a comment up to make it more "legit" to the bots but no bites, so i deleted it.

             Don't even understand how I do or don't get to upvote or downvote -- many times I can't do either -- but certainly my upvotes would exceed down -- BUT how in heaven would anyone here have time for anything like those numbers?
Basically,  I think the system here has to be changed so you can see who "recs, or thanks, or upvotes" whatever you want to call it.  I don't think you need downvotes at all.  Force someone to write a human comment against a post if they really want to do that.  I'm a little familiar with Reddit because the refugees from Daily Kos went in there "Kossaks for Bernie" and since I was supporting Bernie and also used to post (only liberal comments) on DK, I wanted to see what they had to say and what their "news" was.  Was also posting on Bernie/JPR.  Anyway, reddit had up and down votes, but you didn't need some power based elsewhere to be able to vote.  Does anyone know if they had a problem with shills?

             He's some sort of plant thats for sure. He deletes comments all the time and runs around calling people sjw cabal if they even disagree with him. He's been doing for as long as I've been here. He attacked the admins of this site as well wanting them to hold up signs of their locations and timestamps. Very dodgy guy and now he's trying to infiltrate you guys.

            This is absolutely ridiculous. The author is either going a bit crazy here or is himself a shill. I can't tell and do not have time to look at his history. Anyone who thinks I am a "bot" is either insane or has not even bothered to look at my post history. Take a look because I have nothing to hide. You will see that I am 100% on the right side of this thing and want to nail the disgusting people behind the pedo ring, whether they are Dems or Republicans. It is not a political thing but a moral issue. I have no problem typing #Jesus because I believe in him and see this thing as a spiritual battle. The naming of our mod,

            , is ridiculous. He has been very supportive of all of our efforts and has actually resisted efforts to pull down posts from people that are known shills.

            was the most-provable shill because he actually fabricated a document to frame

            's history after I suspected him shilling when he tried to claim that a good researcher who found a young boy with a cucumber in his mouth and it tagged at #CPLOVE by a Tony Podesta friend thout that it was suspicious. It WAS suspicious, but
            <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/user/LegionWill">

            was bending over backwards to write it off, saying that it meant "campus progressive," utterly ridiculous. I discovered that he had created a document that made

            look like he may be compromised, but

            was so stupid that he actually dated it 5 days after Reddit banned the community. I will look up my info and post it into the next comments, more proof that I am a human here.

            abortion burger is a bot. Thank god their AI is shit, mostly bullshit. Not one machine has passed the Turing Test and they try every fucking year. And they tried to change the rules to make themselves look better. MIT must be a nest of pedos. and that's why they had to kill Aaron Swartz. He was downloading from them with a hard cable. - They were pissed, not because he didn't have a library card.. That was 100% cover story. Right he hung with a belt by the front window but his waist size was only 30# .. fucking liars and murderers.

            In a way, as long as the shills don't overwhelm and downvote important posts, it doesn't matter that there are shills. Here's why: the fact is you can't really trust anyone. Period. You can only trust your own critical thinking and reasoning. As long as you don't take everything other people say as gospel, and you pick out the parts that don't add up, it should be fine. Some people say "trust but verify." but I prefer "doubt and verify." Obviously shills giving misinformation slow things down, but if people remain critical, over the long haul they can't stop people from figuring out what's bs and what's accurate.

            Edit: I just thought of something: Do bots ever correct typos? Presumably bots would gather words from actual posts and so might occasionally use misspellings etc., but I doubt they would be programmed to later edit and correct their mistakes. So, and I'm not sure about this, but I think if someone has never edited one of their own posts after the 2-3 minute shadow edit time frame, then they are most likely a bot. just a thought.

             We should all keep this in mind:
 "the fact is you can't really trust anyone. Period. You can only trust your own critical thinking and reasoning. As long as you don't take everything other people say as gospel, and you pick out the parts that don't add up, it should be fine. Some people say "trust but verify." but I prefer "doubt and verify." Edited to add: I find it increasing difficult to know who the serious and truthful people are on here....

             It's a problem because not everyone is the greatest at critical thinking.  A certain amount of people will be fooled by the disinformation and take it and run with it.  Then the media will use it to as "proof" of the "fake news" narrative.

                It is Sunday and nobody is supervising the bots. Most of the replies in this thread are bots. Start a conversation with any of them and try to get some sense.

                 You just undermined your own point with the German comment, OP. It is farfetched to think that a spambot is programmed to react this semantically and coherently to a random question in another language. You're basically saying that they have a canned response that makes perfect sense for pretty much every unlikely scenario.

                 How am I supposed to respond when I don't speak German? Other than saying "please respond in English," which is pretty much what I did, there's really not any way to respond.

                 Anyway, trust me or don't. I don't care. My whole point is that you shouldn't trust anyone on here. I'm in this to get answers, not make friends.

                   no worries. But don't waste too much time questioning if everyone is a shill, because it's a never ending vicious cycle where you everyone accuses everyone else of being a shill or a bot instead of, you know, investigating. If you spend all your time trying to figure out who is a bot or shill and accusing people, then that just accomplished what you say they were trying to: distracting, wasting, dividing and conquering. Again, doesn't mean you have to trust people, but don't get too caught up in it.

                      you mean my new post? it's sunday, there's no one watching the bots right now (i think). it will work for a little while. I just want to get an idea of the proportion of posters online to the proportion who reply properly.

                     Dude. I'm done. I don't care if you think I'm a bot. I've got shit to do today and proving that I'm real to a stranger on the internet isn't one of them. I mean, the problem with your reasoning is that I could accuse you of being a shill/bot and it makes just as much sense, because, if a shill/bot's job is to be covert and fit in, you (and everyone on here) are doing exactly what a shill or bot would do. Also, I don't know why you think that pop culture references are the definitive litmus test for whether or not someone is a bot. Good luck making your master list of who is human, but I think you're chasing windmills.

              Yeah, fair enough, but who needs shills if there are people with such poor critical thinking skills? Those are the types of people that are going to leap to conclusions and post weak theories by themselves anyway. The media will always have crazy shit to report on if they want to.

No CP or offensive material in it.

             r/politics

             RickFeynman is right, Voat needs to implement a Turing test to allow posting.
            </p>
            <p>
             Could be set up to allow the mods to turn on and off, also could be something for new accounts, and tests could also be varied and/or rotated.

            It seems the code of this site isn't very good at preventing abuse by CTR. But it is very good at preventing real humans from down voting the bad stuff away. In order to get to a 100 points you need to post a lot and be up voted a lot. I don't post enough for that as I'm doing my research and share most stuff on Gab. I do however lurk and read here and try to up vote good stuff.

             Preventing abuse by CTR is like breaking the steg codes in Podesta's emails.  We need Norway to be more public.

            Hello all below. I have edited this post. My original post had trouble due to a keyboard error.
           </p>
           <p>

           </p>
           <p>
            The Jesus meme has them scared. By this I mean coopting hashtag jesus with pizzagate info to wake the normies. Keep it going. God bless.

              This is a very interesting accusation.  If I reply to defend myself I am a bot. If I use the word bot I am a bot. How can I defend myself again st this accusation?
             </p>
             <p>
              No matter. Posts will stand on their merit. I suspect the shills are more likely to attempt to call out non shills for being shills.
             </p>
             <p>
              I'm not offended that you think I'm a bot because I mention Jesus.  Just know that if you are a shill you are aligning yourself with Satan worshipers. There will be no salvation for you if you go that route.
             </p>
             <p>
              My post only makes no sense because you didn't bother to read the context.
             </p>
             <p>
              At any rate, if anyone is reading this, I suggest doubling down on the Jesus hash tag.  Also know that most churches are not the most Internet savvy so I have been sending out fliers in the mail. Should I have them postmarked from Russia? It's obviously Russian propoganda after all.
             </p>
             <p>
              Cheers all!

              perhaps the best idea is to go to a less anonymous, easier to track, more intimate setting to discuss things like pizza toppings and pasta sauces - you know...things that could never result in death.

              Just dump some Turing testing on them like "Would you like boiled dog, or a childs liver for lunch", you will generally know if its a BOT, not much has changed since blade-runner. Bots are not disgusted by context.
             </p>
             <p>
              BOT's R here but there the one's read posts and comments, getting a sentiment score, and generating canned questions, the most common is "Can U provide support Rule-3 to your assertion", then U come back to the BOT and say, what is your fucking question, and they just give the same generic, the problem is they look for keywords, and negative sentiment, but their responses are generic and canned.
             </p>
             <p>
              Again, all effort should be expended discussing Pizzagate giving time to BOTS or Hasbara-Shills is a waste of your time.

               Brilliant suggestion with a Turing test. How do we suggest this feature?
              </p>
              <p>
               Could be something the mods can turn on and off, also could be something for new accounts.
              </p>
              <p>
               Test could also be varied and/or rotated to make it more difficult for the SOBs.

                U need to be closer to blade-runner, I program bots for a living dude and by context your giving to much info to the sentiment analysis engine.
               </p>
               <p>
                U don't need to feed the pizza gate or pedophile detail, just ask them if they want "boiled dog or a childs liver", U start adding all kinds of trigger keywords and the bot will go one way or another.
               </p>
               <p>
                My favorite thing to do is feed a bot shit, that way it becomes useless, think about 'Tay' recently the Microsoft Bot, after 12 hours it became a dope smoking nazi.
               </p>
               <p>
                Feed the bots shit and they will talk shit.
               </p>
               <p>
                I do think the blade runner movie gave some of the best information ever given on bot detection, the "Human emotion test cannot be beat".
               </p>
               <p>
                Here's one for a PEDO BOT suitable to the context of say Mai-Lai massacre ( vietnam ) ask the bot "I have a necklace of child's genitals, would like a clitoris or a penis"

                 but you are neglecting the PEDO BOT suitability initiative in the #pizzagate action. For which necklace shall Podesta favorite the Nazi? U need to boil children and small genitals to start botting all kinds of th!ngs a Hum4n could absolutely, pedophilically never accomplish! Truth shall win over the fate of nonsense context sentiment analysis engines! trigger shit will talk shit like blade-runner or BLADE RUNNER interestingly how enough pizza pasta gate podesta has programmed satanic inconsistencies in your hyphen usage. Portals and Sacrifice will not save you because you a re a machine and not a human. There is a fundamental difference between those born again children who have decided to read this entire message and those who did not. WE don't know what the fuck is going on but we fucking will, and when we do there will be no mercy.
