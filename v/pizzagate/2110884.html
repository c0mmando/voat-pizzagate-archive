           <p>
            Closing observations on your video -- 
which I notice btw isn't really circulated and has no comments ...
           </p>
           <p>
            Here's something on "Family Watch International" --
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             Founded in 1999, they
             <strong>
              describe themselves as “a critical and exciting worldwide movement 
to preserve and promote the family, traditional marriage, life, parental rights and religious freedom”
             </strong>
            </p>
           </blockquote>
           <p>
            Iow's they oppose birth control and women's rights and likely homosexual rights based on their religious beliefs.
Likely also all sex education in our schools and all access to contraceptives and abortion.
           </p>
           <p>
            Also in referencing "traditional marriage" it seems to make clear that their mind-set is "patriarchal."
           </p>
           <p>
            And they are focused on the United Nations which approves the material being circulated by IPPF
and the many other organizations accredited by the UN and distributing information on sexual 
education of children ... UNICEF, UNFPK, etc.
           </p>
           <p>
            Here also is a video by Planned Parenthood/Illinois which describes the immense and urgent need
for sexual education in their schools -- and the LACK of it.
            <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CKpjkXopeE&amp;t=4s">
             https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CKpjkXopeE&amp;t=4s
            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            And, as is immensely clear, all sex education in the US has been mandated to be based in
            <strong>
             ABSTINENCE.
            </strong>
            This is the equivalent of a Fireman visiting the schools to warn children of the dangers of fires and then
failing to tell them how to AVOID those dangers.
           </p>
           <p>
            Here's also Pat Fagan's /Marriage &amp; Religion Research Institute website which you 
immediately see shows "abortion" as a top issue for them ... 
followed by "Family structure" ..."Abstinence" ... and "Homosexuality."
            <a href="http://www.frc.org/advanced-search">
             http://www.frc.org/advanced-search
            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            The statistics in the video were also theoretical based in their own
projections and having nothing to do with actual statistics.
           </p>
           <p>
            BATHROOMS continue, of course, to be a huge issue for the right wing --
though one of the last things I would do is use a bathroom in use by males 
because of the filth ... and I think they'd have a better argument if they used
that one.
           </p>
           <p>
            Transgenderism cannot be described as they so arrogantly suggest as ...
"confusion about identity."
           </p>
           <p>
            And, btw, just noticed in a video which "Kon" sent me a comment that this
issue of transgender goes back in history as far as mention by Shakespeare.
Didn't know that and will look into it.
           </p>
           <p>
            I'm not quite sure as I haven't had the opportunity to go back to your video for the
fourth time, but in the scene where children are being shown how to use condoms, 
there is a suggestion that the program is for 11 year olds, whereas I believe it was 
intended for those 14-15 year olds.
           </p>
           <p>
            Students know that the sex education they are being offered in our
public schools based primarily on ABSTINENCE will not protect them.
And they make that quite clear.
There are SIX videos which explain the CSE program, but I only had 
the opportunity so far to watch two of them.
           </p>
           <p>
            The urgent issues for our Planet, Nature, all life on the planet are ...
Population Control which requires reproductive freedom, more user-friendly 
contraception -- and abortion/CHOICE.
HIV and AIDS are still a major concern and young students must be given the
information and materials/contraceptives to protect themselves - condoms.
Sexually Transmitted Diseases still rank high with insufficient education ongoing.
           </p>
           <p>
            The pregnancy rates for young teens remain high and must be met with more appropriate sex education --
and access to contraceptives.
           </p>

           </p>
           <p>
            ESO -- In my opinion, the campaign by organized patriarchal religion to turn normal human
sexuality into a "sin" -- even masturbation which is normal and necessary and a private matter -- 
is criminal and all children must be freed from this brainwashing.
            <br/>
            And it has often been described as the equivalent of a mental "clitorectomy" for females
and we have also seen the effects of these religious teachings on males in guilt over
masturbation and in male-circumcision inflicted upon them.
           </p>
           <p>
            This should also apply to protecting children from FEAR-based religious teachings of
a vengeful "god" and violent descriptions of crucifixions and of saints being martyred.
Nothing like this should be imposed upon children until at least past 12 years of age,
but preferably 18 years of age.
           </p>
           <p>
            And all of these teachings by male-supremacist religion continue on frightening 
children from the very earliest ages in churches and church schools, depriving
children of more balanced views of human sexuality, creating fear and guilt 
lasting even over lifetimes.
           </p>
           <p>
            I'd suggest, ESO, that as long as your underlying beliefs are connected to 
organized patriarchal religion that your "belief" will close your mind to other 
information and knowledge.

            Think you're reading too many "Playbooks" which you're quoting from ... if you're noticed.
           </p>
           <p>
            Of course "misogyny" is involved in all of this --
           </p>
           <p>
            Do you think that males who so fear women and desire to control them and
oppress them do it out of love for women?

            Men can start to save their children from pedophiles by being better informed about who
the sexual abusers of children actually are.

           </p>
           <p>
            I've looked at the link you gave me -- and will have to watch it at least once more.
           </p>
           <p>
            However, it defies all common sense -- and while the "pro-life" magnifying glass is up on
PP it all actually connects to the United Nations, to UNESCO, UNICEF, to UNFPA and to 
Kinsey and what is called CSE- Comprehensive Sex Education.
           </p>
           <p>
            There is no one who wants to see AIDS spread -- and because of the reality of 
bisexual males, it does spread to heterosexual women married to these men.
The AIDS epidemic offered an education for all the world as to human sexuality ...
and in Brazil, a Catholic nation, it exposed the reality that 30% of men there 
were having sex with other men.  Their wives, of course, were showing up 
infected with the AIDS virus, though they were not drug users nor involved 
in affairs.
           </p>
           <p>
            I'm not familiar with Family Watch International but I will look into them.
           </p>
           <p>
            They betray themselves, however, in their call to "Save the family" and for 
"Fathers to rise up" which makes clearer their patriarchal interests.
           </p>
           <p>
            Also in the case of  Margaret Sanger, we see that it is a "pro-life" effort behind 
the lies about her here ....
            <a href="http://www.dianedew.com/sanger.htm">
             http://www.dianedew.com/sanger.htm
            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            If you go to the MAIN PAGE link at the bottom of the page you find this 
"pro-life" offering which is also based in male-supremacist religious beliefs.

           </p>
           <p>
            And when such outrageous claims are made we always want to hear from the other side ....

are you confirming that you are actually uncomfortable with the very idea of homosexuality?

            ESO --
           </p>
           <p>
            I did mention that 3 and 4 year old children are telling their parents that they are mistaken
when they refer to them as the opposite gender ... but when I said it is the child who has the
right to decide, it didn't mean at 3 or 4 years old, naturally.
Let me repeat:  It is NOT going to be permitted by parents any longer to allow a doctor on their
own to decide what the gender of a child will be when it is unclear.
AND, when the parents make clear that it is the CHILD who has the right to decide what their
gender is -- neither does that mean that the parents are allowing a 3 or 4 year old to take very
dramatic steps in their transformation -- such as hormone treatments or surgery.
It simply means that the family and the child work together to make decisions at appropriate ages,
and giving the child all the assets available for discovery and medical care -- including psychological 
guidance and therapy -- or any other help that is necessary.
           </p>
           <p>
            And from what I've learned of these cases -- and you should open yourself up to trying to understand
the issue and actually hear what these transgender people have to say about their lives -- they and
their parents are involved in trying to work out the issues.
           </p>
           <p>
            Needless to say the parents are very concerned about the decisions which have to be made
and that they often do come very early in the lives of their children.
            <br/>
            By that, I mean -- and I think we all recognize -- that if you feel you are a girl it is very painful
to see your body developing as a boy ... so one of the major and early decisions that the 
young child (teenager as far as I've seen) makes with their parents is whether or not to go 
ahead with treatments which slow down or stop that development.
           </p>
           <p>
            In fact, from what I'm aware of, these families consult and seek support from the
wider family members -- grandparents, etc. -- and friends.
           </p>
           <p>
            I have to say again that I really think that those who so aggressively attack the transgenders
really aren't comfortable at all with homosexuality, either ... to begin with.

           <p>
            So you're advocating that the Vatican continue on ... that their wealth should be further contributed
to by citizens everywhere?  That we shouldn't investigate their involvement across nations in 
pedophilia and child trafficking?
           </p>
           <p>
            Why would or should females support organized patriarchal religions which do not acknowledge the full
personhood of females as they acknowledge the full personhood of males?
           </p>
           <p>
            Why should any female support male-dominated religions which bar females from ritual and
authority within the church?

           <blockquote>
            <p>
             Transgender children are so rare in the natural world as to be almost non-existent. The only reason we have this overwhelming EXPONENTIAL increase in "transgender" children is because they were artificially produced and did not originate organically in nature on their own.&lt;
            </p>
           </blockquote>
           <p>
            And just who is it who you think are creating these transgender children?
            <br/>
            Are you saying this is part of MKULTRA?
Keep in mind that MKULTRA didn't invent pedophiles, they just used them and created more 
of them through a program of torture and sexual abuse.
            <br/>
            So that's what you think is happening ... ???

            Are you about to adopt this "trendy in thing" to be? 
Of course not -- 
Nor, if you had a child so afflicted, would you consider it to be "trendy" or fun.
           </p>
           <p>
            Read the studies -- MALES are our sexual abusers of children and they are heterosexual males.
           </p>
           <p>
            And there is no parallel between eugenics and pedophilia ...
           </p>
           <p>
            Elite patriarchy has existed here controlling our government and societies world over ...
and was put in place here by Our Founders -- including land grants -- and tremendous 
influence and control given them over our people's government, the nation's wealth and
natural resources.  That wasn't democracy, it is fascism.
           </p>
           <p>
            This male-domination -- also called "The bird with one wing" has brought nothing but
violence and wars to humanity, spilling the blood of citizens in religious wars and wars 
for empire over and again --
           </p>
           <p>
            has also brought us destruction of the Nature and the Planet.and likely all humanity 
in Global Warming which we see increasing every year in severity and costs and 
of course human life.
           </p>
           <p>
            Obviously ESO you make a point of NOT knowing about these issues ... but parents have
protested and STOPPED doctors changing the genitalia of a child where the actual gender 
is NOT clear.
Again, that is the child's decision made when the child is ready to do so -- not by some doctor at birth.
           </p>
           <p>
            No -- the children are NOT saying that they want to be a boy instead of a girl.  What they are saying
to their parents in their total ignorance at that state of life, or anything sexual is that their parents 
are referring to them in a way which is NOT in accord with who they think they are.
And, like all parents who love their children the parents try to understand the issue and deal with it.
They don't hide their heads in the same -- they do not deny the truths that their children bring them.
They don't "gaslight" them.
           </p>
           <p>
            Tell me, have you ever experienced your body growing breasts, or menstruating?
           </p>
           <p>
            All the while feeling like a boy?
           </p>
           <p>
            OK -- well, I'm sure convinced by your "nope" ...
           </p>
           <p>
            Meanwhile, I don't work for anyone -- I'm an anti-fascist, I'm a liberal.
Where I see lies, I try to tell truths.  It's that simple.

            Let me put it to you this way ... it is a "cult" in the minds of some here who frequently post messages to me which are 
obsessed with Americans accepting pedophilia as a norm.  In fact they write whole OP's about it -- quite often.
           </p>
           <p>
            INCEST -- is the most common form of child abuse and it is a father or step-father sexual abusing a daughter.
Yes, it's also pedophilia when the daughter is very young. 
Americans would NEVER accept in any way the normalizing of pedophilia or INCEST.

            THIS is all about frightening the public -- and to keep people from reading about
the violence they do to children under cover of "Satan."
           </p>
           <p>
            There is no "Satan" but there sure is male violence and trying to blame it on a fake "Satan."
           </p>
           <p>
            Just as Elite Patriarchy had to invent organized patriarchal religion to create a "ONE-All Male god"
to underpin Elite Patriarchy and declare them superior ....
           </p>
           <p>
            So did Elite patriarchy's organized religion have to invent a Satan to blame male violence on.

            A lot of people don't believe in SRA taking place.  It does.  Here is a case in St Louis that has never been solved. There are many others that have been unsolved as well that are believed to have been used in CP and Snuff.  I believe that the this Cult stuff involving Transgenders as well will be connected to CP and Snuff as well.  SRA is hot I believe with Very Sick Pedos around the world.Here is the sumission post and article about the case

             TRUE, this violence is being carried out by men who invented a "Satan" to blame it on.
            </p>
            <p>
             This is also done to frighten the public -- FEAR is mind control.
            </p>
            <p>
             But when you pull back that curtain, you will see that these are simply MALES who are 
sexually abusing children all over the world and trying to blame it on a non-existing demon.
            </p>
            <p>
             All of this fake lore comes from organized patriarchal religion.
            </p>
            <p>
             Americans need to stop supporting male-supremacist religions.
            </p>
            <p>
             Transgenderism is not a cult.  It's about children who find that their mind identifies
as one gender while their body identifies as an opposite gender.
This isn't something that families and children invent for fun.  It's a very serious issue.

              Even if you don't personally like Christianity, if white Christian males truly ran the show, this stuff wouldn't even be happening in the US. It's that simple. You just sound like a wiccan to be honest, or a CIA bot.

              Child abuse is a power and humiliation thing, more than a sexual thing, and it's common for women to be abusers. So I'm afraid you're wrong.

               Our sexual abusers of children are MALES and always have been males despite the lies
told by Sigmund Freud in the Oedipus Complex where he made the outrageous suggestion
that it is infants, toddlers and young children who are the sexual aggressors against male
adults in their families -- i.e., fathers, grandfathers, uncles, male cousins and male friends of 
the family.
              </p>
              <p>
               Freud also betrayed his own young male and female patients/clients who had confided to him
their sexual abuse by males in their families.
              </p>
              <p>
               It is also now thought that it is likely that Sigmund Freud, himself, was a pedophile.
              </p>
              <p>
               "White Christian males" do run the show in Congress and in government and their main activity
is ignoring the will of the people.
              </p>
              <p>
               And that includes the issue of reproductive freedom where they continue to battle against
Planned Parenthood and Roe vs Wade in their continuing Witch Hunt and War on Women.
              </p>
              <p>
               Trafficking in human beings -- slavery -- is about PROFIT.
              </p>
              <p>
               It is wholly uncommon for women to sexual abuse children as studies show .... unless they
are under the influence of a heterosexual male.
              </p>
              <p>
               You can also see this on the filth that rolls out of the Catholic Church where we now know
that not only were Catholic nuns sexually abusing children, they were also helping the church
to profit by labeling children as "retarded" so the RCC could collect more money for the orphaned
children they were caring for.
              </p>
              <p>
               And, we now know that 40% of these nuns were themselves sexually and physical abused by
Catholic priests.
              </p>
              <p>
               Homosexual males are 100X LESS likely to sexually abuse a child as compared with a heterosexual male.
              </p>
              <p>
               Lesbians pretty much have never been found to sexually abuse a child.
              </p>
              <p>
               And, in Hawaii, "before the coming of the white man" .... homosexuals there were held in high
honor and esteem for their care of orphaned children.

              You are spot on, except about the trans cult.  Sex is biology; gender is foisted on us.  Gender dysphoria is real. But most children grow out of it.  The trans cult would have us put these children on life-altering drugs and destroy their bodies. That is child abuse.

               Evidently male medicine has always taken action to HIDE these transgender births
where they were obvious - i.e., mixed genitals -- in newborns.
Doctors made the decision but parents are now protesting those decisions and interference.
The child has to determine for itself what their true identity is.
              </p>
              <p>
               So -- clearly, there is no expectation that "children grow out of it."
              </p>
              <p>
               And I imagine that these kinds of births are much more common that we've been told by our
male-dominated medical system.  I've read that it's about 14% of all births.
              </p>
              <p>
               It is very painful for a child who identifies as feminine to see her body maturing into the body
of a male.  And vice versa for someone who identifies as a male as his body begins to develop
as a female with female breasts, menstruation, etal.
              </p>
              <p>
               Personally, I have to say that I think it must be very painful for parents to consider 
surgery for their children, but that seems to be what eventually happens ...
whether it is immediately carried out by doctors at birth, or whether it is done later.

                Votescam, 'mixed genitals' is another name for intersex.  In fact, every person is born with either XY or XX chromosome--that's what makes you male or female.  Yes, people are born with micro-penises or other physical sex organ abnormalities.  They are intersex.  They do NOT want to be lumped into the LGBTQIA.   If you're talking about cases like David Reimer, they are anomalies.  David Reimer was born a boy but raised as a girl after the doctors destroyed his penis.  He suffered years of depression and ultimately took his life.
               </p>
               <p>
                I suggest you read the definitive studies of transgender MtF by Bailey and Blanchard.   I've talked about them before, so won't go over them again.
               </p>
               <p>
                Evidence shows that the overwhelming majority of children who suffer gender dysphoria (thinking they are born in the wrong body) grow out of that dysphoria, many becoming gay.  What we should be doing is allowing boys and girls to be and act how they want; stop putting limitations on what is a 'girly' thing to do and what is a 'boy' thing to do.
               </p>
               <p>
                It is really painful when a child thinks they're in the wrong body.  But if we start accepting boys who are soft, sensitive and who love pink and girls who like to play with trucks and are tomboys, perhaps these kids wouldn't think they were in the wrong bodies.  We should be telling these children that they are PERFECT the way they are; and that it's okay for them to act and be in the world however they see sit--without cutting off their breasts, the self-mutilation of surgery, and life-altering drugs.
               </p>
               <p>
                Paediatricians the world over are coming out against this push to make kids decide whether to be a boy or a girl when they're little.

                 Rather it was the medical profession -- doctors -- who were deciding at birth what gender
a child was if genitalia was confusing.  Parents began objecting to that as the choice is the child's.
Not a doctor's.
                </p>
                <p>
                 What you are talking about is NOT what transgenderism is about -- 
You have not mentioned the MIND at all -- and the mind and the genitalia also have
to be in agreement.  That isn't what's happening with these children.
                </p>
                <p>
                 Also, these fake norms which were set up by patriarchy when changed certainly 
confuse people who simply don't like change.
But it seems that there has always been something like 14% of our births which represent
confusion of some kind.
                </p>
                <p>
                 The insistence you offer that children will find their gender identify somewhere in the future
ignores the reality of what children are telling us today -- i.e., that a 3 year old well knows
that she does not like being identified as a boy because she feels within herself that she is a girl.
And vice versa.  Somehow I don't think this is anything new. . . 
I just think that patriarchy's insistence on sexual and gender "norms" served their interests ...
not really the public's and we are now all waking up to find that things are different from the lies they told.
                </p>
                <p>
                 And now you're suggesting it's the parents fault for not IMPOSING or FORCING stereotypical roles on their children?
                </p>
                <p>
                 Yes -- all children are perfect the way they are -- and they best know who they are.
                </p>
                <p>
                 We can all talk about the pain involved here for children who watch their bodies develop into a gender
they feel is the opposite of their true identify ... but we've never experienced it ourselves.
Let's trust children on this issue of transgenderism, as well .....as we should be doing and must be doing in this issue of child sexual abuse.

              I realize that transgenderism is a very serious and personal matter and not made up in most cases. But I believe they are pushing this because these children/adults look strange to most people and thus will make victims for SRA.  I know that is far fetched but I think they are capable of pushing such a horrible thing.  I should have explained myself more clearly.  I do not follow any male-supremacist religions for years now.

               These children do not look strange to me -- they look like a mix of male/female often.
              </p>
              <p>
               Just as we can see the male/female nature of lesbians and homosexuals.
              </p>
              <p>
               And, of course, each of us -- even if we consider ourselves heterosexual -- share some of the 
traits or characteristics of the opposite gender.

                Of course it is the very ones that we are fighting that are pushing it.  They are getting the Hollywood crowd to dress their kids in opposite sex clothes and look at Jenner he went from male to female.  I am totally convinced he did it to beat the wrap he would have faced for that person that died in the accident he was in.  Just like the guy Welch that did the false flag to get off of hitting that teen.  They are trying to create these trans genders to normalize the changing of the sexes and so it will be easier for them to normalize the pedophilia.  That is my feeling.  I have nothing against those that have these problems in real actuality for they must feel tortured inside and I feel they should get all they help they need.  But I feel there is something else going on with their engineering their sex genes or just forcing it upon kids, for many kids do question their sexuality at certain times in their teen lives especially.  They will stop at nothing to push this stuff forward that is all I am saying.

                <p>
                 I don't pay very much attention to "celebrities" ...
                </p>
                <p>
                 However, if you're at all familiar with the Youth Revolution then you understand that stereotypical
standards of "gender" are imposed upon everyone by male patriarchy.
                </p>
                <p>
                 The idea that men could have long hair frightened the hell out of other men ...
                </p>
                <p>
                 Girls who would run and play as boys did used to at age 12 have their skates and sleds and 
bicycles taken from them -- and moved into dresses and very quiet activities.
Happily, we see young girls today moving into very physical activities and sports with no limits
on them at any age.
                </p>
                <p>
                 Many parents have stopped buying gender specific toys for their children, allowing them to 
show their own interests in toys.  If a girl wants a fire engine or a sword ... fine.
If a boy wants a baby carriage and some cooking pots ... fine.
                </p>
                <p>
                 I'm not really familiar with Bruce Jenner who is now female - so no comment.
                </p>
                <p>
                 Transgender is NOT something you can "create" ... And certainly transgender victims are not 
getting body parts cut off for "fun."  Why would you think something like that?
                </p>
                <p>
                 Nor does transgenderism have anything whatsoever to do with pedophilia.
                </p>
                <p>
                 Can you "engineer your sex genes" .... ???
                </p>
                <p>
                 And why would parents want to force something as problematic as transgenderism on their children?
                </p>
                <p>
                 What you might think about is the many chemicals that have polluted our planet and the fact that many
males have such low sperm count that they can't father children because of it.
Rather than TREAT the male however, we see that women are subjected to injections and fertility
treatments to increase the number of eggs they ovulate each month in order to increase the chances
for a pregnancy to develop.
                </p>
                <p>
                 And what happens?  Women are carrying multiples of children.
Twins, Triplets, Quads, Quints -- none is too many for the fertility industry.

                 But, have you ever given any thought as to WHY that might be happening as women the 
world over have used birth control and abortion to limit births?
                </p>
                <p>
                 We had a Pope who for the first time ever met with the Italian Congress to order them to 
force Italian women to have more babies.  In order to save capitalism.  Not because 
children are such joy, but because they needed labor -- i.e., more births!

                 If YOU questioned your sexuality at certain times in your teen years, you might think it's normal.
                </p>
                <p>
                 Many people who have had that happen to them often suggest that homosexuality is a matter of CHOICE.
It's not.

                 I can tell you that I knew by 1st grade that I was attracted to males.
Nothing pre-planned, but I still recall it today ....
The first days of school, we were all standing to say the Pledge ...
There was some rustling behind me and I turned to see this little boy squirming 
around and I understood immediately that he had to go to the bathroom.
I kind of smiled a little knowing smile at him.  Turned out he lived across the street from me.
The next morning he was waiting for me and he and his mother and I walked to school
together.  He always waited for me each day to return home, as well. 
And he would often hold my hand.
Many people know their sexuality from a very early point -- no doubt about it.
                </p>
                <p>
                 There is NO way the American public will ever accept pedophilia as anything but abnormal ....
NOR will they ever permit willingly their children to be sexually abused.
Sexual abuse of children will always and forever more be assault and rape -- a crime.  Nothing else.
                </p>
                <p>
                 ALSO, let me remind you that the most common sexual abuse of children is father or step-father 
sexual abuse of a daughter.  And we call that INCEST.  No chance the negative reactions to INCEST
will go away either.

                  I agree with everything you have written.  It is just that I do not trust THEM just like the pope.  I pay no homage to any star, but suspect that they are doing whatever they can to try and convince our children that it is OK to accept pedophilia.  That is what scares me, THEM.  I kissed my first boy when I was four, so I guess I knew what I wanted at an early age.  Others I am sure did too.  I am just afraid that THEY may convince children to question who they are through movies, toys, etc.  I know that they cannot change it but it seems that is  what they are trying to do.  As far as people accepting their disgusting habits, they are creating carbon copies of themselves everyday trying to turn kids into pedophiles by raping them over and over and that I believe is their goal.  To create as many as possible.  People are asleep is what I am afraid of.  NO many will not accept it, but I am losing my faith in the Sheeple to ever Wake Up.

                   You seem to be constantly fence-sitting ....
On the one hand you acknowledge the issue is legitimate, but then you do
acrobatics to try to suggest that it's connected to pedophilia and that
somehow  -- though you agree it won't happen -- Americans will accept pedophilia!
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   It's only my opinion, but I don't think you are comfortable with the basic issues at all.
That is, that you really don't know what to believe is true.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   No one is EVER going to convince Americans to accept pedophilia or any sexual 
abuse of children or anyone else for that matter.  It's assault, it's rape and it's criminal activity.
NOT going to happen.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   Give you mind a rest and stop obsessing about this -- it's a non-issue.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   Don't trust the CIA/MKULTRA, of course, who have been turning out pedophiles
to disrupt the nation and as free labor for them.

                  Everyone is born either a male or female--XX or XY.  You cannot change that; you cannot change your sex.  Yes, a man can dress as a woman and wear make up, and even have surgery, but that does not make him a woman.    You are confusing gender and sex.  Gender are the stereotypes which are forced upon us by society.  We should be fighting for the abolition of gender.
