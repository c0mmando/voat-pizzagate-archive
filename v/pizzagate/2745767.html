             Maddie was ritually sacrificed in the flat because of her beauty and special eye defect. Loads of high level Luciferians were present.

            Wow.  I read a lot of this and am also convinced that they allowed some type of abuse by someone powerful or with a lot of money.  Gerry had CP on his computer that was removed and I wonder if he used his children to manufacture it himself or it was of other children.  Either way, he saw nothing wrong with the abuse of a child so why not allow it to happen to his own daughter for a Huge Price?  But something went horribly wrong.  Or was it planned?  Idk, but Kate and Gerry sold off their daughter.  I think she knew what Gerry had planned or she was in on it too, but she never thought that her daughter would disappear or be gone forever.   That's why she said "They took her."  Thus proving she was surprised by that fact.  The fact that Maddie was gone.  She did not expect they would take her.  What did she expect they Would Do to Maddie?  We may never know.  Tony Blair's name has been mentioned in connection to the abduction.  We may never know about that either.

            <p>
             My thoughts exactly.  There are several reasons to believe the involvement of high level paedophiles in the death of Madeleine McCann:
            </p>
            <ul>
             <li>
              The immediate involvement of British Security Services (MI5 and the intelligence linked) Control Risks Group) is a massive red flag when one knows of how intelligence agencies use paedophilia to blackmail and control assets.  Indeed, the level of protection the McCanns have enjoyed from the British government, police (who, along with MI5, actively obstructed the Portuguese investigation) and media stinks to high heaven
             </li>
             <li>
              Dr. Kathrina Gaspar's statement to Leicestershire Police of Dr. David Payne's sexually in appropriate comments/gestures about Madeleine in a conversation with Gerry McCann, as well as Leicestershire Police withholding Dr. Gaspar's statement from the Portuguese Police for over 5 months
             </li>
             <li>
              Gerry McCann's name popping up in the C.A.T.S. system, indicating that he had at some point been under investigation for child abuse, possibly for possession of CP back in 2002, as you say
             </li>
             <li>
              The refusal of the British Home Office to provide the McCanns' bank/credit card statements, phone records or Madeleine's medical records on the grounds of "national security".  Why on earth would a 3 year old's medical records be a matter of national security?
             </li>
             <li>
              The video taken at the beginning of the holiday of Gerry McCann responding to one of the Tapas 7 telling him to, "Cheer up..." with, "Fuck off, I'm not going to Portugal to enjoy myself!"  Was there some other purpose for his trip, then?
             </li>
             <li>
              The support given to the McCanns by prominent paedophiles like Clement Freud and Dr. Ray Wyre.  Was it a sick joke to these people to be seen supporting a family whose little girl had been "abducted" or were they there to ensure the McCanns stuck to the script?
             </li>

              Oh, I so agree with all your points.  Have you ever heard of the woman that lived downstairs from the McCanns below their flat?  She told of one night when she heard a child screaming and crying for her Daddy.  She kept calling for her Daddy and it implied she Was Crying.  This went on for quite some time.  The woman was really bothered by the sound of the child and wondered why Gerry had not come to her aid.  After a while she heard the McCann's coming home and going upstairs.  They were NOT at home all that time that the child was crying over and over.  No one came to her aid.  I remember that she thought the child was Maddie.  What was going on up there?  Wish I could find it.  Someone sent it to me, hopefully they will again.

                Pamela also said her niece, who stayed with her the week Maddie disappeared, spotted somebody fitting the description of a man seen carrying a child away under a blanket. The pal added: “He was acting suspiciously.”
 A friend said: “She was surprised that neither the police nor the McCanns had approached her before.”

                WOW.  This does not really surprise me.  I am sure they would rather this would just blow over and be forgotten.  There seem to be a lot of accounts saying that she recanted her statement.  That too smacks of baloney.  Why would this woman put herself into this kind of mess at her age unless true.  I know a Victim/Survivor and she always says she has nothing to gain by making up her story.  I tend to believe Pamela Fenn.
