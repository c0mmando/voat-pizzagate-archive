           <blockquote>
            <p>
             In February 2002, DeRogatis, then a reporter and music critic for the Chicago Sun-Times, anonymously received a now-infamous 26-minute video and passed it on to the police. The tape allegedly shows Kelly telling a girl to call him "daddy" and urinating in her mouth. The girl's aunt told the paper that the girl had only been 14. "It's crap, and that's how we're going to treat it," Kelly told a Chicago TV station at the time.
            </p>
            <blockquote>
             <p>
              Kelly was indicted four months later on multiple child-pornography charges and faced up to 15 years in prison. After finally going to trial in 2008, Kelly was found not guilty on all 14 counts. (Jurors admitted after the trial that they could not verify the identity of the girl, who did not testify, despite more than a dozen witnesses identifying her on the tape. Consequently, they could not definitively say that she was underage.)
             </p>

           <blockquote>
            <p>
             Kelly's alleged manipulation of women dates back to 1994, when the singer, then 27, married 15-year-old R&amp;B singer Aaliyah. In 1996, Kelly was sued for $10 million by aspiring vocalist Tiffany Hawkins, who claimed that she first began having sex with Kelly at age 15 and "suffered personal injuries and severe emotional harm because she had sex with the singer and he encouraged her to participate in group sex with him and other underage girls." (The lawsuit was settled for an undisclosed sum in 1998.) Kelly would eventually settle separate suits brought by two more women who said they'd had sex with him when they were under 18.

              I remember RKelly mostly because of the Chappelle skit.  Then the videos of girls on stage at his concerts in this verse.  Check out this blog, there is no reason RKelly should not be in prison.  The Justice system has failed many children with him.
