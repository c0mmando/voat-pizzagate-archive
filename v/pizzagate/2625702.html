            This is just a sad reflection of the type of mentality that completely destroys the PG movement. Obviously not every swirl, even if it coincidentally looks identical to the pedo swirl, is a pedo swirl but that didn't slow you down. This is bullshit and you should know better. Anyone who takes this seriously should know better.  Sometimes I get the feeling that posts like this are intentionally designed to discredit PG. I find it hard to believe that anyone with an IQ would say what you did and be serious. If not trolling or shilling, this is a very bad reflection on this movement. I know I'm not the most popular guy here, but like I give a fuck. I'll correct obvious BS like this when I see it.

             I wholeheartedly agree with you, and have been saying the same thing almost since I joined.
Not every right-handed pale blue swirl or left-handed pale-pink triangle or whatever automatically means that that person or establishment (or whatever) is flaunting their pedophilia for all to see while they walk free.
Not every single person in any position of power got there or whatever because they are a pedophile or are sacrificing children to harvest adrenochrome every Saturday night at Bob's House, Bar &amp; Grill and Dungeon.
Experiment time:  Take three plain white t-shirts, and paint/magic marker/what have you, one with the girl-lovers symbol, one with the boy-lovers symbol (exactly like the FBI documented ones), and just write "I Am A Pedophile" on the last one.  Then, wear each one around town for a day, and see which one garners the most attention.  Do people come up to you and offer to take you to their secret clubhouse (Bob's House...) when they see you wearing one of the symbol shirts, or do you get the most attention (read as: get beat down, chased out of town, get gunned down by gangbangers who have kids) wearing the pedophile shirt.
This is not about a secret society so secret they think they can conduct their business in broad daylight while being broadcast on CNN 24/7 nationwide all the while being immune to prosecution because they know a person... this is about a select few (like the now-famous Biden groping video) who think nobody is watching.
            </p>
            <p>
             As I've said before, if we're not careful, this whole thing turns into the Number 23 Syndrome... look hard enough, and all you see are 23's everywhere... 23 steps to the front door, 23 minutes in line at the bank, 23 people walking down an aisle at the store, et cetera.
            </p>
            <p>
             What we (on this board, as researchers) need to do is stop jumping at shadows, stop jumping on every single possible bandwagon we see.  Just because someone finds an article that says "HRC was seen shaking hands with the mayor of a town in Timbuktu, Georgia", that doesn't mean that the mayor is into the same stuff HRC is (if HRC is even into that stuff in the first place... yeah, I know... the JP e-mails and all that... sure, it's an odd bunch of e-mails, and known pedo code words are used and all that, and her name is mentioned and all that, but it could just be that JP is the pedo and for all we know she's totally clean... hell, she may have set him up through the e-mails... but with everyone looking every which way but at her involvement, we'll never know.
I openly admit, I don't have the time to sit and pour over everything I can find (work 9 hours a day, plus about 1.3 hours spent riding bus to and from work, that doesn't leave a lot of time for much else), but don't just look at one source... if you find a juicy tidbit, back it up with as many other sources (points for other places that don't just copy and paste the exact same thing over and over ad infinitum.  If you find a gold nugget on CNN, find the same named person someplace else, or the same offense or victim or whatever.  If it's a shady site that nobody's ever heard of, double the effort to verify.
If this ever goes further than some fringe conspiracy and ends up in court, the more seriously researched and vetted posts from us and anyplace else that is helping the efforts, the better.  If this all ends up in court, imagine you end up before a judge, and all you have is a couple pictures of a pedo swirl and some unbacked claim that HRC &amp; WJC are sacrificing kids to drink their adrenochrome and some guy in Nebraska is running a pedo brothel out of a Sheriff's department... we're gonna look like a bunch of raving idiots, even though a couple people had the smoking gun proof all along.
And, JackBlack1, this ain't a popularity contest... this is typically the kind of thing I post in response to the average "satanic HRC, adrenochrome drinking" post... if you can
             <strong>
              prove
             </strong>
             it, then I want to see the proof.
And, that's what this is all about, is proof, not hearsay.
So, you say you found a website that shows that Obama is a lizardperson... and they claim to have proof... show me the proof!  Without solid proof, it's just a story.

             It's the triangle, looks exactly as in the fbi doc. But this thread is old news.
