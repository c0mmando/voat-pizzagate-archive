<p>This chapter will look at the work schedules of various suspects to determine how likely it is they have a strong alibi for the various incidents in the BI.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.chicagotribune.com/entertainment/movies/ct-ent-what-does-a-movie-producer-actually-do-0222-story.html%3foutputType=amp">https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.chicagotribune.com/entertainment/movies/ct-ent-what-does-a-movie-producer-actually-do-0222-story.html%3foutputType=amp</a> A Producer is essentially like a team manager in sports terms. The guy who does the “behind the shadows work” that makes a film run.</p>
<p><a href="https://m.imdb.com/name/nm0000229/filmotype/director?ref_=m_nmfm_3">https://m.imdb.com/name/nm0000229/filmotype/director?ref_=m_nmfm_3</a> </p>
<p><a href="https://m.imdb.com/name/nm0000229/filmotype/producer?ref_=m_nmfm_1">https://m.imdb.com/name/nm0000229/filmotype/producer?ref_=m_nmfm_1</a> Looking at Steven Spielberg’s production schedule for the years 1986-1987 (producer and director), we can most definitely rule him out as a culprit in the Rocky Road incident. His highly busy schedule during this time gives him an airtight alibi for this incident. Note that an earlier chapter places him DIRECTLY on site for the Poltergeist incident.</p>
<p><a href="https://m.imdb.com/name/nm0000165/filmotype/director?ref_=m_nmfm_3">https://m.imdb.com/name/nm0000165/filmotype/director?ref_=m_nmfm_3</a></p>
<p><a href="https://m.imdb.com/name/nm0000165/filmotype/producer?ref_=m_nmfm_2">https://m.imdb.com/name/nm0000165/filmotype/producer?ref_=m_nmfm_2</a> Given that most of Ron Howard’s work in 1986 and 1987 was as a producer (more or less back field types), his alibi for Rocky Road is more shaky. More so given the likely time of day of the incident in question.</p>
<p><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Happy_Days_(season_10)">https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Happy_Days_(season_10)</a> However, Ron Howard was NOT involved in Happy Days Season 10. Combined with his work in 1984, his alibi for the Happy Days Incident is air tight. However, he is most likely a person of interest who knows about what happened.</p>
<p><a href="https://m.imdb.com/name/nm0001661/filmotype/actor?ref_=m_nmfm_1">https://m.imdb.com/name/nm0001661/filmotype/actor?ref_=m_nmfm_1</a></p>
<p><a href="https://m.imdb.com/name/nm0001661/filmotype/producer?ref_=m_nmfm_3">https://m.imdb.com/name/nm0001661/filmotype/producer?ref_=m_nmfm_3</a></p>
<p><a href="https://m.imdb.com/name/nm0001661/filmotype/director?ref_=m_nmfm_4">https://m.imdb.com/name/nm0001661/filmotype/director?ref_=m_nmfm_4</a> Based on this, we can conclude that Rob Reiner was not exceptionally active in the years 1984 and 1986. Meaning that his alibi for BOTH the Happy Days and Rocky Road incidents is weak.</p>
<p><a href="https://m.imdb.com/name/nm0000158/filmotype/actor?ref_=m_nmfm_2">https://m.imdb.com/name/nm0000158/filmotype/actor?ref_=m_nmfm_2</a> As shown in an earlier chapter, Tom Hanks was directly at the set of Happy Days for an episode with Heather O’Rourke. The last movie of his in 1986 was released one week AFTER the Rocky Road incident. Note that editing and other wrap up work takes place in the last 1-2 months before a film’s release. The only 1987 film was released in June. Depending on how long filming the scenes took, this means that Tom Hanks alibi for Rocky Road is VERY weak. </p>

<p>Richard Vane’s alibi for Rocky Road is virtually non existant.</p>

<p>Timeline: </p>
<p>-Poltergeist Series. Three incidents over a period of 5 years ranging from 1982 to summer of 1987. The crimes themselves occured in Simi Valley, California, Culver City, CA, Altadena, CA, and Chicago, Illinois. Suspects: Steven Spielberg, Frank Marshall.</p>
<p>Accomplices: Judy Wix</p>
<p>-Happy Days: Most Likely Suspects: Garry Marshall (dead), Bobby Hoffman (dead), Henry Winkler, Tom Hanks, Rob Reiner. Accomplice: Penny Marshall (dead).</p>
<p>-The Fatal Incident. Note that this incident is the START of Heather\'s fatal down turn rather than a quick death. Location: On the set of Rocky Road. Hollywood, California.</p>
<p>Time: November 7, 1986. The incident backstage involved anally violating her with a foreign object. 3 men were involved. Execs flocked to the studio, so its possible for a culprit to be one of the flockers. A medic was called in likely because what they did perforated her colon. The injury was severe enough that it also inflicted either penetrative or blunt force trauma on her small intestine, more specifically, her ileum. For this reason, I suspect that the object itself was a hard object. Possibly made of metal or some other hard material. I’d say the object in question was about 10-14” long. Heather\'s illness (the one that was covered up) first started to manifest around December 1986. I suspect that the Chrons diagnosis was the cover up. The episode was released in May of 1987. She was on medication throughout filming of Poltergeist 3 as her condition worsened. Heather\'s health took its fatal downward spiral on 1/31/1988 before she died on 2/1/1988. The funeral was an open casket event on 2/5/1988. The &quot;skinning&quot; was most likely on the following night, with the casket being looted. This crime is fully possible because Heather was interred in an above ground mausolium according to accounts of those who attended the funeral. </p>
<p>Suspects (Rocky Road): Gene Abravaya, Arthur Annecharico, Chris Colombus, Richard Vane.</p>
<p>Accomplice (others): Wesley Staples. Corey Feldman. He actively covers for the big pedowood names and their crimes, which would make him an accomplice. Other accomplices include the MSM, Patrick Little and Tom Steyer due to their involvement in the attempted false flag along with Gabe Hoffman for protecting Steven Spielberg. Fredrick Brennan for deplatforming 8chan, a site that was providing informants in this case.</p>
<p>-Cause of Death: Sepsis infection and intestinal stenosis of the ileum (last 1/3 of small intestine) due to repeated anal rape related injuries and infections. The main incident responsible was the injury to her small intestines as a result of the Rocky Road incident.</p>',

           A Producer is essentially like a team manager in sports terms. The guy who does the “behind the shadows work” that makes a film run.

           </a>
           Looking at Steven Spielberg’s production schedule for the years 1986-1987 (producer and director), we can most definitely rule him out as a culprit in the Rocky Road incident. His highly busy schedule during this time gives him an airtight alibi for this incident. Note that an earlier chapter places him DIRECTLY on site for the Poltergeist incident.

           </a>
           Given that most of Ron Howard’s work in 1986 and 1987 was as a producer (more or less back field types), his alibi for Rocky Road is more shaky. More so given the likely time of day of the incident in question.
          </p>
          <p>
           <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Happy_Days_(season_10)">
            https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Happy_Days_(season_10)
           </a>
           However, Ron Howard was NOT involved in Happy Days Season 10. Combined with his work in 1984, his alibi for the Happy Days Incident is air tight. However, he is most likely a person of interest who knows about what happened.

           </a>
           Based on this, we can conclude that Rob Reiner was not exceptionally active in the years 1984 and 1986. Meaning that his alibi for BOTH the Happy Days and Rocky Road incidents is weak.

           As shown in an earlier chapter, Tom Hanks was directly at the set of Happy Days for an episode with Heather O’Rourke. The last movie of his in 1986 was released one week AFTER the Rocky Road incident. Note that editing and other wrap up work takes place in the last 1-2 months before a film’s release. The only 1987 film was released in June. Depending on how long filming the scenes took, this means that Tom Hanks alibi for Rocky Road is VERY weak.

           Timeline:
          </p>
          <p>
           -Poltergeist Series. Three incidents over a period of 5 years ranging from 1982 to summer of 1987. The crimes themselves occured in Simi Valley, California, Culver City, CA, Altadena, CA, and Chicago, Illinois. Suspects: Steven Spielberg, Frank Marshall.
          </p>
          <p>
           Accomplices: Judy Wix
          </p>
          <p>
           -Happy Days: Most Likely Suspects: Garry Marshall (dead), Bobby Hoffman (dead), Henry Winkler, Tom Hanks, Rob Reiner. Accomplice: Penny Marshall (dead).
          </p>
          <p>
           -The Fatal Incident. Note that this incident is the START of Heather's fatal down turn rather than a quick death. Location: On the set of Rocky Road. Hollywood, California.
          </p>
          <p>
           Time: November 7, 1986. The incident backstage involved anally violating her with a foreign object. 3 men were involved. Execs flocked to the studio, so its possible for a culprit to be one of the flockers. A medic was called in likely because what they did perforated her colon. The injury was severe enough that it also inflicted either penetrative or blunt force trauma on her small intestine, more specifically, her ileum. For this reason, I suspect that the object itself was a hard object. Possibly made of metal or some other hard material. I’d say the object in question was about 10-14” long. Heather's illness (the one that was covered up) first started to manifest around December 1986. I suspect that the Chrons diagnosis was the cover up. The episode was released in May of 1987. She was on medication throughout filming of Poltergeist 3 as her condition worsened. Heather's health took its fatal downward spiral on 1/31/1988 before she died on 2/1/1988. The funeral was an open casket event on 2/5/1988. The "skinning" was most likely on the following night, with the casket being looted. This crime is fully possible because Heather was interred in an above ground mausolium according to accounts of those who attended the funeral.
          </p>
          <p>
           Suspects (Rocky Road): Gene Abravaya, Arthur Annecharico, Chris Colombus, Richard Vane.
          </p>
          <p>
           Accomplice (others): Wesley Staples. Corey Feldman. He actively covers for the big pedowood names and their crimes, which would make him an accomplice. Other accomplices include the MSM, Patrick Little and Tom Steyer due to their involvement in the attempted false flag along with Gabe Hoffman for protecting Steven Spielberg. Fredrick Brennan for deplatforming 8chan, a site that was providing informants in this case.
          </p>
          <p>
           -Cause of Death: Sepsis infection and intestinal stenosis of the ileum (last 1/3 of small intestine) due to repeated anal rape related injuries and infections. The main incident responsible was the injury to her small intestines as a result of the Rocky Road incident.

            Every time I read about Hreather or Judith I want Steven’s head. Now I want TomH to be outed just as much. I’m hating them equally. Ron H as well. Rita Wilson was also on a Happy Days. Once or twice. Wonder about her.

            I just went digging, and I found nothing, which is odd because I remember very well that actor Craig T Nelson had a time in his life when he left pedowood and lived, almost like a mountain man, off the grid. My memory is that he went to Montana and lived the rugged life, very few creature comforts, way out in the sticks.
           </p>
           <p>
            At the time of his return, around the time he got the role as Coach, it was kind of a big deal. There were stories written about how he had taken a break from society to really find himself and become one with nature, blah blah blah. Now I can't find any mention of that.
           </p>
           <p>
            I remember it well because many people were wondering why he would take off like that after the success of his hit movies, (poltergeist and poltergeist 2). The official story now is that he left show business before those movies and worked as a plumber, carpenter, hs teacher, and other odd jobs. That's not the way I remember it though. And I remember it well because at the time I was a little jealous! As a kid growing up I really wanted to get away from everyone and live in the mountains like the trappers and prospectors of the 1800's! The stories about him were that he lived my dream.

            Now it seems all that has been erased.
           </p>
           <p>
            While reading your post I kept thinking, now I know why he took off!

             I hate that show. Mainly because of Jerry VanDyke. He sold off his daughter and eventually she died from drugs and alcohol not to mention living with the abuse and knowing what your father thought of you. These people are beyond help and hope.

               Bye I’ve been wondering about his brother Dick VD. What happened to Jerry to act like that? Idk never heard anything about hm. So maybe it’s just him. Dick is still alive into his 90s.

               I know. I was going to read it to refresh memory but I couldn’t handle it while reading this post. In the account I read (maybe CDAN) it names one of the pedos he sold her off to. Famous name. Just beyond disgusting. She was married before she died and had therapy. Sometimes just nothing will help. The pain cuts that deep.
