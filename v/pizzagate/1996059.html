            Life insurance will not pay on a suicide for a specified amount of time/usually 2 years.  Evidently Mr. Smith had the policy for more than the time limit.

           <blockquote>
            <p>
             Peter W. Smith, 81, left a carefully prepared file of documents, which includes a statement police called a suicide note in which he said he was in ill health and a life insurance policy was expiring
            </p>
           </blockquote>
           <p>
            So he committed suicide because his "life insurance policy was expiring". He must have known that insurance companies don't pay out in the event of a suicide, and in fact will challenge accidental deaths and try and convince the court it was a suicide.

               Yeah, it is hard to say anything about his mental state.  It sounds like he was pretty well educated, and should have known.

               I think Flynn has the goods on everyone, and that is why they pushed him out.  I just wish they would release everything so we can deal with it.

             Actually this would more like an Mar-a-Laragoacide because he just admitted to reporters that he was working with Russian hackers close to the Kremlin and trying to get Hillary Clinton's emails to use during the election.
            </p>
            <p>
             Two separate witness say that he was telling people he was working with the Trump Campaign and that they supported this project.  Witnesses said he was particularly close to General Flynn and often seem to have insight into the very top of the campaign before it was public knowledge.  Smith denied this and said he was working on his own behalf.  However he set up a coroporation to pay people on this project and the documents said it was to avoid "campaign reporting,"  I.e. reporting to the FEC who was paid by the campaign and why.  In that document he listed several members of the Trump campaign as parties to this company including Flynn, Bannon and Conway.
            </p>
            <p>
             from the Chicago Tribune
            </p>
            <blockquote>
             <p>
              Smith committed suicide in a hotel near the Mayo Clinic at 1:17 p.m. on Sunday, May 14. He was found with a bag over his head with a source of helium attached. A medical examiner's report gives the same account, without specifying the time, and a report from Rochester police further details his suicide.
             </p>
             <p>
              In the note recovered by police, Smith apologized to authorities and said that "NO FOUL PLAY WHATSOEVER" was involved in his death. He wrote that he was taking his own life because of a "RECENT BAD TURN IN HEALTH SINCE JANUARY, 2017" and timing related "TO LIFE INSURANCE OF $5 MILLION EXPIRING."
             </p>
             <p>
              "Tomorrow is my last day," Smith told a man at the hotel while he worked on a computer in the business center, printing documents between 8 and 9 p.m. on May 13, according to the police reports.
             </p>
             <p>
              One of Smith's former employees told the Tribune he thought the elderly man had gone to the famed clinic to be treated for a heart condition. Mayo spokeswoman Ginger Plumbo said Thursday she could not confirm Smith had been a patient, citing medical privacy laws.

              Right. Who was more likely to have him killed? The Clintons who have had dozens killed and been involved in numerous corruption cases and an impeachment, or President Trump who has had 0 corruption of any sort proven, even with Hillary's $1 billion campaign budget.

               Trump has had zero corruption?  Are you kidding me?
              </p>
              <p>
               Off the top of my head.
              </p>
              <p>
               Trump just paid $25 million dollars in a fraud suit.
Trump has a long history of working with mob figures including
              </p>
              <ul>
               <li>
                <p>
                 Daniel Sullivan a labor racketeer and FBI informant.  Trump used to boast that Sullivan killed Jimmy Hoffa.  Trump offered to go into business with him and later hired him.
                </p>
               </li>
               <li>
                <p>
                 Nicky Scarfo of the Philly Mob.  Trump bought his casino location from him.
                </p>
               </li>
               <li>
                <p>
                 Trump then lied about his mob contacts when he applied for his New Jersey Casino license. Had he been honest, he would have been prevented from getting a license.
                </p>
               </li>
               <li>
                <p>
                 Roy Cohn was Trump's mentor and a mob lawyer his clients included
                </p>
               </li>
               <li>
                <p>
                 Fat Tony Salerno and Paul Castellano.  Trump used to buy his concrete from them.  Trump Tower is probably the tallest concrete constructed building in NYC.
                </p>
               </li>
               <li>
                <p>
                 The building where Trump Tower stood was demolished by illegal Polish immigrant working non-union wages under unsafe conditions.  The only way to get away with this on a big Manhattan Job site was by paying off that union.
                </p>
               </li>
               <li>
                <p>
                 Trump had a personal relationship with the mob associate Robert Libuti who was the biggest player at Trump Taj Mahal.  Trump would fly by helicopter to AC with Libuti and attended his daughter's wedding.
                </p>
               </li>
               <li>
                <p>
                 Trump Taj Mahal was hit with the biggest money laundering fine ever against a casino in the early 90s for a case involving the Russian/Ukranian Mob.
                </p>

               <li>
                <p>
                 Trump's development career was resurrected after his bankruptcies by a shady hedge fund called Bayrock.  Due to his multiple bankruptcies no New York banks would lend Trump money for deals.  Bayrock supplied the financing for Trump Soho and after he was pictured with partners at the opening, the NY Times revealed that, one of those partners was a convicted Russian gangster named Felix Sater. Sater worked with both Russia mob and the Italian mob.  He was convicted as part of $40 million dollar "pump and dump" stock fraud with members of 4 of the 5 NY mafia families.
                </p>
               </li>
               <li>
                <p>
                 Felix Sater then went to work for the Trump Organization itself.

               </li>
              </ul>
              <p>
               Sater's on the right.  The other man is another ex-Soviet, a man connected to Kazakh oligarchs.  I forget his name, but he was arrested in Turkey on the charge of providing underage prostitutes to business man during a party on his yacht.  The charges were later dropped.
              </p>
              <ul>
               <li>
                <p>
                 After Trump worked with Sater on Trump Soho, he claimed under oath not to know the man and wouldn't recognize him if he was in this room today.  (He often says that when lying about the shady people he knows.)
                </p>
               </li>
               <li>
                <p>
                 Sater is still involved with Trump and this year delivered a plan to lift Russian sanctions to General Flynn at the White House through Trump's lawyer Michael Cohen.
                </p>
               </li>
               <li>
                <p>
                 Sater's father and Sater himself are said to work for Sergimon Molelivich, a Ukranian who is the biggest gangster in the world.  (A lot of Trump's contacts are not just Russian, but Ex Soviet)
                </p>
               </li>
              </ul>
              <p>
               Other examples of corruption.
              </p>
              <p>
               When Trump claimed that $900 million dollar loss on his personal taxes, he didn't pay those losses himself.  Right after this, he took the Trump casino company public and did a stock IPO.  He then transferred his personal debt to the company, so his personal debt was paid by the shareholders of his public company.  This would represent 900 million in income.  He would have needed to pay taxes on this.
              </p>
              <p>
               Trump routinely didn't pay his bills.  Lots of business in Atlantic City would sign a contract for $100,000 of paint, for example, and they would do the job and Trump would offer them $70,000 or they could sue.
