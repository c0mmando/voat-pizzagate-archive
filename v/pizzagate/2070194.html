            He pissed you off too? This thread is going to be deleted....

            He tried to make amends in the end when I proved he was right exposing the Democrats making laws to force children to praise praise OTO and NAMBLA supporters (SB 48 Californian Bill). He's since - finally tried to make amends and admit he was wrong, then new troll accounts with the same style and tactics came after me.

            Dark Math admits he was wrong before and his angle trying to defend / debunk my claims that the democrats made laws all children must hail the NAMBLA king Harry Hay can't be debunked.

               Trolling? I made a post tonight about the Weimar Republic:

               That was enough to set Donkeyhote off. I merely posted some of my research.

                 Honestly, I considered you to being someone who literally is doing a dial-an argument sketch right out of Monty Python's Flying circus who doesn't fight fair and answer the arguments put to them properly (until after 3-6 months credit to you for that) who always has to have the last off topic word. That tactic drives people friggen crazy.

               <p>
                Without hatred or malice as long as you swear to god you are not Drew West Pedo Press (an unfortunate co-incidence your "trolling" of me and his trolling of me occurred int he same week and was equally as aggravating due to the tactics employed in the first sentence of this post., I believe that is honest and fair criticism that stops you from making friends here.
               </p>
               <p>
                Now is not a time to trigger the white nationalists. They were publishing some truths the mainstream media wasn't and sharing intel on pedophiles, albeit with a bias against jews and blacks, but just no better than black lives matter. Now with the suppression tactics they are facing they are going to be marginalized more and it's going to spill out / manifest itself physically. Don't keep prodding the sleeping giant there.
               </p>
               <p>
                They have an army of ghost wholves ready to strike. I hope they don't self-activate.  Because then the ultra-left will use that to end trump and build their socialist motherfucking utopia as explained in this video by Bob Brown who's co-founder of the Greens Party Australia writes books about dog fucking bestality. (i'm not joking)

                Not all of them are good. I've done battle with Martin Lindstedt who I believe sodomized his own grandson and was let out of jail as an FBI informant and you should have seen I the battles I had with that SOB. I'm just saying compared to ANTIFA - which has government protected pedos and NAMBLA in their midst if I had to choose a side you know which one I would be on.

               <p>
                Remember I chose the easy way out, I fled Australia in 2007 once I realized the gay police officer who arrested me was connected to the twenty10.org.au VIP gay judge child prostitute rent boy dorms. 7 years later my allegations are coming out in parliament and the guy who sued everyone for not respecting gays who gives all lawsuits victories to twenty10.org.au for boy arse is exposed in court as a pedophile. It takes a long time to win against this filth. I am only fighting in my struggle because they started it first, backed me into the wall and the only way out it through them.
               </p>
               <p>
                If i stayed and fought and was more of a tough guy like the guy flipping out at you - I would probably be a dead nobody and a #3 in the unreleased crime statistics for 60C NSW Crimes Act - crime of obtaining true information on corrupt police and nobody would have heard of me.
               </p>
               <p>
                So yeah the WN types hate me for getting out of dodge and race mixing, but I don't feel guilty because that was survival instincts.

                  Korea - until I came across the police protected Jeju International English village pedo camp. I was on national news exposing it. See youtube.com/hojuruku most popular videos.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  See soundcloud.com/hojuruku &amp; hojuruku6725 - founder of camp blackmails Australian principals by tricking them into brothels to supply ozzie kids for sex. I have the manager of the camp on tape (in korean) trying to invite my friend into a brothel as well as an Australian principal admitting it on tape there.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  Every Korean government funded school principal gets a free sex session with every child rape camp organized through Jeju International English village.

                  Beg me and I'll try and rehost the high-res of this. The cunt make korean's educational policy with fake credientials of having a degree whilst running an illegal unlicensed English camp that's unique selling point was that foreign children work as teachers (child labor - against the law). The camp that I shut down and exposed on Korean National KBS 9pm news (see my channel) was booked in a Love Motel because their facilities were demolished earlier. Because the other foreigners worked there illegally except for me (I wasn't an E2 visa) todd thacker did a hit piece on me. If you had a classroom of kids saying they were touched inappropriately you would have done everything I did.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  After I left Korea a whole boat of children was sunk with the children told not to evacuate on the Equinox - a mass ritual child sacrifice on the boat to Jeju Island. It's a long and complex saga. I put it behind me, but I'll write a book about it when some of the pedos connected to the camp finally get arrested. If fags or pedos even come near me now it's fire and ice. I walked out of job yesterday when I found the co-teacher was a dyke - I wont even put myself in the same room as these freaks if I can avoid it.

                   Holy shit. I remember that. Didn't the President of Korea just get arrested for devil worship? There was a mass protest with like 3 million people in Seoul demanding she step down. Did she play a part in that ship sinking?

             Oh look, another jew faggot pedophile who's into "batman". I guess you want to relive being 9 years old, the very first time your Dad and your rabbi raped you in the Grand Talmudic Tradition! Say hi to James Holmes for me at Jewish Big Brothers!!!

             Honestly, I hope your jew pedo skull is smashed open soon. I hope a nigger takes a lead pipe and smashes your jew pig snout in with it. ANd I hope your entire family of jew dog shit - men women and children - are lined up and shot in the back of your maggot commie skulls.

              I did mention the  talmud in my sources for the jim fetzer interview but only to pisstake jews wrote the holy scripture that faggots must be stoned to death not Christians who plaugized it word for word from the bible. You can see it on the archive.is link for the sources for the jim fetzer interview. With all the Christians being prosecuted for hate speech reading from the bible I'd like to see Jews get their equal share. That's why I brought it up.

              did you dox any of these ppl you speak of, pm the details to me and I'll investigate it if it's true. Revenge against pedophiles is a dish best served in a cold, calm and calculated manner if you want to get away with it.  At this point I'm not going to brag or self incriminate, you never can.

              That's what the Citizens Ombudsman's Organization on the dark net is all about. It's only rumored to exist and I like it that way. someone has to build a list using a CRM to track all the filth for the day of recognizing if it comes to be dealt with by citizen trials.

              Is this a false flag against me? As much as I hate marriage equality activists normalizing pedophilia I didn't write this. I just got home from work and I see this.

                  I usually get the posts exposing gay pedophiles getting police protection (just like Alefantis) quickly deleted by the mods. They are the worst enemy. They don't anyone to wake up see pizzagate isn't an isolated occurrence, and is part of a larger scheme in place to protect the LGBTI pedo elite.
