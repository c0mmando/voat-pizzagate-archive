            I doubt it's a trap, but create a throwaway account if you want to comment.  I agree that caution should be exercised, but the cat is out of the bag on pizzagate.  With thousands of people researching and spreading the word, they have no motive to go after anyone, unless you find a true smoking gun, in which case be extremely careful.
           </p>
           <p>
            I think one actual purpose of numbchuck's (if it really is numbchuck)
            <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy">
             /r/conspiracy
            </a>
            thread is to try to frame the pizzagate mods as shills (shills have been attacking the mods from day 1 as part of their disrupt, deny, discourage campaign).  That actually may have been one major motive for numbchuck's deletions (if kevdude hadn't caught him when he did, it could have caused a full-scale rebellion against the mods).
           </p>
           <p>
            I think another one of numbchuck's motives with the post is to try to keep people from investigating Dyncorp, which is closely connected to the CIA.  If the mods were trying to "distract" users with Dyncorp as a fake lead, wouldn't we have at least flaired the post as "important"?  kevdude has asked me to add the relevant info to the summary sticky, but only because the info has apparently struck a nerve, as shown with the apparent Dyncorp attack on the Pizzagate wiki, and numbchuck claiming it isn't connected to pizzagate.

             I think there is a very good chance he was experiencing an episode of Stimulant Psychosis. His behavior fit it to a tee. If so, his deletions may be random and not meaningful in terms of covering up, distracting or otherwise impacting the investigation.

             Mods, it might be a good idea to post a reminder to folks following Pizzagate that they make sure they are taking good care of themselves. This is dark shit. It hits people hard. It's easy to become obsessed, get no sleep, lose interest in other things and experience powerful feelings of worry, anger, helplessness etc. If you are someone already taking meds for ADHD, anxiety, insomnia, or have exposure to abuse in your past, this can get dicey fast. This guy clearly snapped under the strain. We need to stay strong, keep our balance and not burn out.

              I don't think so.  In his post on

               /r/conspiracy
              </a>
              , he outright lied, and someone (him via alt account?) apparently posted fabricated evidence to support the lie.  He also deleted his account after being removed from the mod team.  All evidence points to him being a shill.

             <p>
              In the reddit post, he claimed Dyncorp is not a lead.  One of the threads he deleted was a frontpage thread linking Dyncorp human trafficking to Epstein (and therefore the Clinton Foundation).  I don't think that was random.

             I actually would like to discuss this one with you.  From my point of view (as a system admin) Tor does offer several levels of protection, but not pure safety.
            </p>
            <p>
             Most sites (including this one) log your IP address into a database.  By simply passing your IP through 1 node you obfuscate out the sites system administration.  (So, that's your private interest unable to follow your actions.)  To investigate further (from a tech, non phishing point of view) a private interest has to contact the authorities to get information on the activities of that node over that time period.
            </p>
            <p>
             So, yes the GOV and ISPs can monitor a single node (depending on how good the ISP's logs are).  By providing 3 nodes and bouncing them through several different countries you take local ISPs out, and then get into the realm of GOV trunk / GOV exit node monitoring.  Most of that information is classified, so they don't just hand out information to localized police forces on a whim.
            </p>
            <p>
             Once you are at that level, the prime players of concern become multinationals with their fingers in the US / EU / China Gov or those governments themselves.  So, you have to piss off some rather large fish to get noticed, or be doing something exceptionally illegal.
            </p>
            <p>
             Of course none of this matters if you send your personal information over clear text (hate people who don't know how to put a cert on a site), or are stupid enough not to run things you download in a sandbox first.  But, most people who use tor are at least smart enough and paranoid enough for that.
            </p>
            <p>
             Anyway, WTF do you mean by doesn't offer anonymity or safety.  It's a sure shit better than just rambling through the clear net.
            </p>
            <p>
             Edit:  If you're trolling, you suck at it.  Anybody who knows tor will think you're retarded.  Anybody who does not you may have ran off.  That's why I've posted a reply.  People should know what tools are at hand, their strengths and their weaknesses.

              I appreciate your apparent sincerity, but TOR is SO compromised on SO many levels your assumed protections and obfuscations are bypassed and identity and locations verified through advanced associative means. When we have a completely compromised Internet backbone and have ALL traffic looped through the largest data center the world has ever seen, all of our "protections" are simply shredded.
             </p>
             <p>
              Unless you are communicating on an air-gapped network in an RF secured location deep underground, you are subject to constant snooping and associative identity verification at all times. That's just a fact.
             </p>
             <p>
              We have also seen govt/corporate collusion at unprecedented levels, so what makes you think that Raytheon can't make a phone call and get advanced analysis conducted on their behalf? You can't be that naive.
             </p>
             <p>
              Can one achieve practical security against clever teens overseas? Sure. Can one maintain true anonymity on the internet? Only for a very short time through extraordinary means involving grossly impractical methods.
             </p>
             <p>
              No troll. That's just a fact, sir.

               Ah, when you're pissing off people at that level you are fairly well fucked.  But, obfuscation is a powerful deterrent to 99.9% of seekers.  Don't underestimate it.
