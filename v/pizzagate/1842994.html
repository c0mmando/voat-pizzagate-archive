            Full Transcript of Kanye Rant at Sacramento show:
           </p>
           <p>
            <strong>
             Stop it, stop it. Hey radio, fuck you! Radio, fuck you! Y’all don’t want to lose again. A lot of people here tonight felt like they lost. You know why? Because y’all been lied to. Google lied to you. Facebook lied to you. Radio lied to you. Radio, fuck you! I know it’s a lot of real niggas working at radio, real people, real programming directors with wives and kids that love music, that can’t play what they want to play because they’ve been paid to play that bullshit over and over and over. And when I say that bullshit, what I’m saying is we love Drake, Drake is great. He’s a great artist. But Frank Ocean is great, too. But you know who the greatest of all of us? Who do y’all think? [Crowd shouts “Kanye” and other names] Nope. Kid motherfucking Cudi. Radio, fuck you! Oh yeah, I’m on my Trump shit tonight. Radio, fuck you. Yeah, I’m taking his lead. I’mma just say how I say, be ‘Ye, and win. I’mma take his lead. Radio, fuck you! Radio, fuck you! Wait a second. Eh, is it, “Radio, fuck you? That’s what you’re saying?” Exactly.
Not fuck the people that work at radio because these is real people that gotta feed they kids and they’re not being allowed to play that real shit because they think that in order to feed they kids they gotta play the same shit over and over and over. I was raised by KRS 1, I was raised by Tribe Called Quest, I was raised by DMX. The last real nigga alive? Naw, nigga! We real niggas alive, we alive tonight, bruh! We alive tonight, bruh! Virgil Abloh is alive tonight, bro. A$AP Nast is alive tonight, bro. [A$AP] Bari is alive tonight, bro. Ian Connor is alive tonight, bro. [A$AP] Rocky alive tonight, bro. Aye, y’all love my show. When I say these names, y’all better scream for me. I don’t give a fuck if you know the names or not, go ahead, Google them. They will give you a little bit of factual information. They will give you that. Why did I name A$AP? Because that’s the future. That’s the niggas they got me and Cudi […]. It’s life
            </strong>
            <strong>
             We’ve got a hundred years out here, a hundred years on this planet, bro, and we can have a utopia. We can love each other. But the rules gotta be fair. Khaled and Drake and radio and Doc and [Real] 92.3 and everybody. Is it just me or did you hear that song so many times “you say you wanna play for free.” Aye, aye. You know what it is, though? Because aye, I love Drake. I love Khaled. But they set that song up, bro. And let me tell you something: MTV, fuck you! Once again, as always. I’m on my Trump shit tonight. Let me tell you what it is, bruh. Aye, you know me. I went down seven years of my life of motherfuckers hating me for saying Beyoncé had the best video. Hey, baby, let’s rock and roll tonight. Y’all might be experiencing a lot of pop shit, but the vibes is back. The prodigal son, Kid Cudi, has returned. The vibes is back. I know it’s going to be a lot of conversations after tonight
            </strong>
            <strong>
             Khaled, I know you got hitters from Miami. Please do not send them at my head. I just want to have a conversation about how we playing radio’s game. Khaled, you a real nigga. Khaled, you a real nigga. You got the keys. But as we learn all the politics that niggas was doing for years. Obama couldn’t make America great because he couldn’t be him to be who he was. Black men have been slaves. Obama wasn’t allowed to do this [screams] and still win. He had to be perfect. But being perfect don’t always change shit, bro. Being perfect don’t always change shit, bro.
            </strong>
            <strong>
             So, when I talk about MTV, let me explain something. I was hurt. Beyoncé, I was hurt because I wanted to present a video called “Fade” and I don’t expect MTV to help me. Mr. West, I don’t respect you. I will let you know that Beyoncé is winning the video tonight for “Formation” over “Hotline Bling” and “Famous.” They told me beforehand so I wouldn’t run on stage. Hey, bruh, y’all ain’t gotta fuck with me, but you know I got the vision and you know I’mma gonna keep it real with you. Beyoncé, I was hurt. I went down seven years on behalf of your—eh, nigga! Don’t […] no shit while I’m talking. I am putting my career, my life, my public well-standing at risk when I talk to y’all like this. This is a moment in the […], bro. The vibes is back. The vibes is back. Motherfuckers might feel a way about this tonight. Beyoncé, I was hurt because I heard that you said you wouldn’t perform unless you won Video of the Year over me and over “Hotline Bling.” In my opinion—now, don’t go trying to diss Beyoncé. She is great. Taylor Swift is great. We are all great people. We are all equal.
            </strong>
            <strong>
             But sometimes, we be playing the politics too much and forget who we are just to win. Fuck winning. Fuck looking cool. Fuck looking cool. Fuck being cool. Fuck all that, bruh! I’ve been sitting here to give y’all my truth even at the risk of my own life. Even at the risk of my own success, my own career. I’ve been sitting here to give y’all the truth. Jay Z, call me, bruh. You still ain’t calling me. Jay Z, call me. Aye, bruh, I know you got killers. Please don’t send them at my head. Just call me. Talk to me like a man. I’m not trying to be the man. I just am a man, the same as anybody here. I ain’t above, below none of y’all. We all equal. We all equal. This is the vibes, bro. This is the future. This is the way of thinking to make America great again. Ha! You didn’t like that! Guess what? Y’all need the vibes. I was hurt. Feelings matter, bro. The way motherfuckers put money up so high, popularity, radio spins. Feelings matter, bro. Feelings matter, bro
            </strong>
            .
            <strong>
             It’s a new world, Hillary Clinton, it’s a new world. Feelings matter. Because guess what? Everybody in middle America felt a way and they showed you how they felt. Feelings matter, bro. It’s a new world. It’s a new world, Barack. It’s a new world, Jay Z. Hey, don’t send killers at my head, bro. This ain’t the Malcolm X movie. We growing from that moment. Let ‘Ye be ‘Ye. And wait a second. Do y’all agree with that? Let ‘Ye be ‘Ye. Wait a second. I ain’t hear enough screams on that. Let ‘Ye be ‘Ye
            </strong>
            <strong>
             People I’m not saying this out of my own well-being because it wouldn’t be smart out of my own well-being to say things like this. Radio, I done talked to you a bunch of motherfucking times. Y’all motherfuckers is behind the times. Because guess what, the Saint Pablo tour is the most relevant shit happening. The Saint Pablo tour is more relevant than radio and if y’all keep following old models, your ass is going to be Hillary Clinton. You might not like it, but they gotta hear it. I ain’t here to massage you with a fake truth, telling you that Hillary gon’ win over and over and over and then you wake up [and] you still can’t believe it! You know why? Because you was lied to by Google. You was lied to by Mark Zuckerberg
            </strong>
            <strong>
             Mark Zuckerberg, you wanna call me now? Do I got the vision, Mark Zuckerberg? Was you wrong? When I said I was $53 million in debt and you didn’t call me, was you wrong? You ate dinner, you asked my friend Ebony Schiller to have dinner with me. I told you about Donda. You said you would help and you didn’t. Then you went to look for aliens. Me and Kid Cudi are aliens right here, bro. The vibes is back. [Talking to DJ] Take it all the way back to the beginning. Shia LaBeouf, Kid Cudi feels a way. Give him a call
            </strong>
            <strong>
             Q-Tip, I love you, bro. Don’t tell me how to be me, though. I love you. The Tribe album is dope. I love you. Don’t tell me how to be me, though. I’ve been me. I am me. There’s a Richard Pryor interview that you can watch about people coming into power and not changing everything and just becoming a part of the power. That’s happened with musicians because they’re scared. I’m not scared. I’m here to change things. I am here to change things. And things won’t change until people admit their own falsehoods. I got the visions, bro. That’s what I’ve been blessed with. My vision. I’m not always going to say things the perfect way, the right way. But I’m going to say how I feel. Right now, press get ready to write your passive-aggressive, LeBron James, racist comments. Season 4, racist comments. Get ready to have a field day, press. Get ready, get ready. Because the show’s over. [Drops mic]

             Personally my thoughts are Kanye's either been replaced or heavily sedated after Electro shock. His good friends haven mentioned he's getting his memory back.
            </p>
            <p>
             Anyway, The clothing line dropped yesterday and

            It's relevant IF Kanye actually mentioned Pizzagate in his rant, or directly implied it by mentioning e.g. children. That has been disputed. Anyone have an actual vid of that?

            holy shit I'd be on a bender for a couple of days. And that's me with no money. If I had the money Kanye has I'd be on a bender for a week.

           <p>
            Two days into a bender and you're just getting going which bee tee dubs makes me so thankful I never had a money. I shudder to think what kind of trouble I'd have gotten into with unlimited resource. I wasn't gifted with great sinuses as it is.

            This is a real shame. I don't trust Kim Kardashian or anything she has to say. She always seemed like an informant/handler ... or maybe she was just a prize. Not sure what's going on, but the disappearing is not good. He should have stayed in Trump Tower.

             Before Kardashians, gossip rags had the unfortunate habit of reporting celebrity scandals. But they paid dearly for it. As a side note, The Enquire was making a killing off the O.J. Simpson murder investigation and trial which eventually merged into the reality TV revolution. With the help of fake celebrities, the secondhand media got plenty of planned content free of potential lawsuits: Why else see Speidi, Whatever Kardashian on every single rag every single week.

              And real stars were put under control. Remember, they had just started demanding that TV pay adequate salaries based on show popularity. This is equivalent to Wendy's getting rid of workers for demanding livable salaries. Plus which non-talented ordinary yutzes would TV select to be pretend celebrities? Most likely the ones that were promoting the narrative and those being rewarded. The Kardashians were rewarded for the father hiding evidence of what OJ did.

During the frenzy of Pizzagate coming out and the pictures of Spirit Cooking devotee Marina Abramovich personal relationships with Hollywood stars it was revealed Jay Z had collaborated with her on an album. Pictures were also released of stars at "sinister looking" faux cannibal parties put in by Marina Abramovich.
           </p>
           <p>
            Kanye was going on tour with Jay z &amp; Beyonce and had a concert in California.
           </p>
           <p>
            While on stage in front of millions and on live television he started ranting about Hollywood, obama, HRC and Mark Zuckerburg. He pointed to the crowd and said "you have all been lied to." He called the aforementioned people liars, Facebook liars, Google liars, &amp; then said Pizzagate is real,this is about the kids. He was very upset.
           </p>
           <p>
            He then called out Jay Z and said I know you got killers who are going to put a bullet in my head now cause nobody talks anymore they just have killers.
           </p>
           <p>
            At this point several of his handlers rushed the stage and took him down. He was put inside a psychiatric hospital for several weeks. Everyone said it was exhaustion but he allegedly would not accept treatment. He got out and the first picture of him was taken as he entered Trump Tower in NYC. DJTrump then came down the elevator with him with his arm around him gave him a bear hug and said I will see you later. Seems like Kanye went for protection of some kind.

             Did Kim K's apt get broken into before or after that?  I wonder if it was Jay's goons trying to rough her up because of him speaking out and not so much about the jewelry she had.

             "Trump then came down the elevator with him with his arm around him gave him a bear hug"
            </p>
            <p>
             I did see that and Kanye's broad smile spoke a thousand words. It was such a smile of relief and hope. It was like Kanye had 1000 lbs lifted off his shoulders. That smile said Trump is going to take down the Deep State and he asked Kanye to keep quiet while the trap is set.
            </p>
            <p>
             I got a similar feeling from Ben Swann right before he went quiet. He tweeted about Sun Tzu's the art of war. And there have been other people who've gone quiet like Milo who was going to talk about Pizzagate then was asked to keep quiet by someone in DC which I'd guess was someone associated with Trump giving Milo the same talk that Trump gave to Kanye.
            </p>
            <p>
             Everything's pointing to a Deep State take-down sometime this summer. I'm virtually certain because if the Deep State isn't taken down then all the clauses in the Constitution regarding Misprision of Treason start to find purchase. Anyone who DOES NOT do something yet knows about the crime can face the same penalty the perps do.
            </p>
            <p>
             Ditto for all the Military who took an oath to protect the Constitution against enemies foreign and domestic. Any action to take down the Deep State by anyone in the Military who took that oath is protected by the Constitution. A formation of M1 Abrams tanks could show up in Chappaqua New York and get a medal for it a year later if you know what I mean. It  sounds harsh but it's not. We're literally at that point in our country. We have no government left.

              . Misprision of Treason is the greatest phrase ever. 75% of the government just sh**t their pants. 10% are in line to turn States evidence. 5 % are American Heros and there should be lots of job openings for patriots who have been fired, staulked, suffered are suffering from PTSD because of being silenced by their own government. Some have been killed quickly, some slow for being WB.
             </p>
             <p>
              Yes Trump came down that elevator with Kanye. It was an intentional message to those "killers" to not "f..ck" with Kanye. 
He had not just mentioned pizzagate he told everyone the MSM were liars, Hollywood were liars, Obama was a liar, Zuckerburg was a liar that they needed to start thinking for themselves.
             </p>
             <p>
              Think of the trillions of dollars that will be saved when phony charities are halted, phony NGO's, fraud.

              Yes I get your Tzu day comment from Ben Swann and the Art of War. This is the biggest chess match ever played.

               Trump tweeted to the Democrats last week: "Our country needs a good "shutdown" in September to fix mess!". It doesn't get more obvious than that. These people are talking big time shit to each other and it's hysterical to watch because it's so out in the open.
              </p>
              <p>
               The only question I have isn't related to whether there's a Deep State takedown it's to what degree will DC "shutdown". Lately I've been hearing rumors from Abel Danger that Trump is going to be stepping down within 3 months. To me that means DC will literally be powered down while the onerous task of taking down all those guilty of High Treason plays out. I wouldn't be surprised to see another Constitutional Convention this cluster fuck is so big. That's how bad it is down there.  We'll find out sooner rather than later of that I'm 100% sure.

             Yes, the day it happened there was a video on here with him and someone wrote the words he spoke on here.  He was then taken to the LA hosp where all the starts go, you know the one, that was connected to the MK Ultra.  Brain Scramble.  He fought it, but who knows.  Thanks for your clarity and explanation.

              I have plenty a clue,  this belongs on a conspiracy forum. If someone can source how this is related specifically,  then it's fine,  but until then,  then thread should be deleted.

               No you actually have no clue. Read the explanation given during the post and after. How could this not relate to pizzagate when Kanye said Pizzagate is Real everyone is lying to you from his concert stage in front of millions on live TV. Then said he knows JayZ would put a bullet in his head about it and was tackled on stage and put in psych hospital involuntarily. He next appears at Trump Tower needing some protection. Again as

                 Honestly Cig5smokman I could have assembled this post in a more critical manner and could have detailed how Hillary et al are 'tight' with Jay Z. , how many times they have parties.  I could have detailed how Alexander Crowley is associated to spirit cooking and Abramovic.  I could have shown many things.  I didn't because i don't feel like this forum is a place for spoon feeding people step-wise logical thought progression.

                  It's not about spoon feeding, ego needs to be set aside for real research. It's about being responsible for what you are sayingor writing.  Holding yourself and others accountable for statements made, using sources to prove beyond any doubt, to eliminate speculation, lies, trolls, crazy people with serious mental issues, and any other forms of deviation from the absolute truth.
