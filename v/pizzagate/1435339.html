<p>&quot;Even if, ultimately, Hannibal is cooking human flesh, a lot of people say that when they see the food sequences, they wish they were at the table,&quot; says Jose Andres, one of many L.A. culinary stars satisfying Hollywood\'s need for onscreen authenticity
This story first appeared in the Oct. 3 issue of The Hollywood Reporter magazine.</p>
<p>&quot;Hannibal loves his food; he doesn\'t eat the way a cannibal eats. This I understand,&quot; says Jose Andres, chef and owner of The Bazaar at the SLS Beverly Hills and Miami, along with restaurants Jaleo and China Poblano in Las Vegas, as well as the Minibar empire in Washington, D.C. &quot;I have a lot of ideas of how Hannibal would be inspired to cook something. The way he cooks is clean. He is stylish, the way he sautes.&quot;</p>

            Great work. I just knew this guy was suspicious. You found a lot of stuff. You know the first thing that made me think twice about him was his face. He has a weird face.

            I think he is quite famous in the food world compared to someone like James Alefantis. Have seen him quite often on shows like Top Chef (watched all seasons..).

            Also isn't the article just about the fact that he was responsible for the "food" Hannibal cooks in the TV show?
