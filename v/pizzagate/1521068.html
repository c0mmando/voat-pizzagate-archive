            the sibel edmonds videos goes into this, she is the FBI whistleblower / translator. Apparently it especially applies to the judiciary and is a theory why Scalia was (allegedly) murdered.

             Way back when the British secret service and perhaps the Soviet equivalent specifically recruited gay spies as they could be so easily shamed and blackmailed to cooperate by threatening to distribute secretly made tapes of their assignations to their families. When being homosexual or bisexual became universally more acceptable the powers that be turned to the last universally shocking sexual perversion in their arsenal.

             For those politicians who don't care to engage in sex with a young child of either sex they would be taken to a party, given a lot of liquor and/or drugs openly or secretly, and then filmed at a party where an orgy with children was taking place. That would be enough to shock citizens in their home towns as well as their families if they were exposed. It was a way of guaranteeing cooperation on future votes. Any potential dirt on an individuals' past would also be manipulated and put into their file as a potential weapon if the need arose.

             It's been a long time very common practice all over the world with anyone relatively known. Famous actors hire bodyguards to escort them to the bathroom so no one photographs them or tries to set them up with an aggressive partner for a quick sale to the paps for profit.
