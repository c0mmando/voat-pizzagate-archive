            Reddit is like a ride on an overcrowded subway with lots of tattooed, black lipstick, blue-haired fat girls looking at you with fish mouths while a gang of niggers hoot and chimp out around the seats as they spew out racial slurs at everyone including light skinned niggers while threatening anyone nearby as the lights flicker on and off to the screech of steel wheels and the smell of puke and unchanged diapers emanating from a group bearded hasidics and their swinging payots sneering at the crowd amidst the smell of stale urine.

            Voat is like a ride in the country in a one horse open sleigh after a fresh blanket of snow.   ...so there's that.
