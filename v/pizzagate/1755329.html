<p>Here is an article I found on a Satanic website where they were debating Ostara (Easter / Ashteroth / Ishtar / Isis) and this particular link will take you to their opinions about murdering mundanes. It says that we are all expendable resources to them:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;I post - for comments - part of a controversial, and recent, article from the Order of Nine Angles about culling.
Satanic Sacrifice
If there is one thing which expresses the essence of the Satanic ethos it is culling; and if there is one way to detect a pseudo-Satanist it is their attitude to culling.
As it says in our pledge of allegiance to Satan:
&quot; I accept there is no law, no authority, no justice Except my own And that culling is a necessary act of Life. I believe in one guide, Satan, And in our right to rule mundanes.&quot;
The Order of Nine Angles has always advocated culling, maintaining it is a Satanic practice; the ONA will always advocate culling. Why? Because there are mundanes, and us. A basic principle of Satanism is that mundanes are not only a resource, for us, but also expendable. This, in essence, arises from our Satanic morality – that we are better, more valuable, than mundanes.
The pseudo-Satanists are appalled by this attitude, just like Nazarenes are. For these pseudo-Satanists, “sacrifice” means some sort of “self-sacrifice”, where, for example, they say stupid things like: “Those who seek energy outside of their minds and wills, are too weak for the practice of Magic…”
To us, this is just Nazarene-speak, covered by the slick words of weedy charlatans. For they are basically weak, afraid. They do not have our élan, our style, our satanic ethos, our elitist morality – our defiance of mundanes and everything mundane.
To such Nazarene-speak we Satanists say: why should we, in some ritual for example, denude ourselves of energy when mundanes can supply not only whatever energy we may need but also give us energy to enhance our ritual and our lives? There is a reason, of course, why our Dark Goddess, Baphomet, is called The Mother of Blood. Our Sorcery, our Magick, is really Black, really Dark, genuinely Sinister. Dangerous.
Satanism is a defiance of mundanes, a defiance of mundanity, par excellence. Satanism is the ethos of arête, which means we judge people according to their personal character. The worthless are worthless; expendable. Therefore, why should we not put them to good use?
For us, culling is natural fact of life – of how we live, or how we desire to live. Of course, there are different ways of culling mundanes – not every culling takes place, or needs to take place, in some Satanic ceremony or ritual, although obviously that is a great source of Satanic joy. A good way of culling is war; another is stirring up religious and political conflict; another is insurrection, revolution, assassinations, and so on. In fact, any means of conflict offers opportunities for culling; opportunities for those of Satanic character to weed out the weeds and reduce the surplus population of mundanes. Another, more personal way – and a good means of developing Satanic character – are “accidents”. And so on. You get the idea....
So, good riddance to mundane trash. Good riddance to everything mundane.
Those who are not our sinister brothers or sisters are mundanes&quot;</p>

            Ishtar and Isis are not satanic in origin. They are positive-divine archetypes, as the 'christ-consciousness' of jesus/yeshua represents... Satanism is the inverse of these concepts. There is a massive amount of confusion about these things, which has been done purposefully through the co-opting of the Abrahamic religions.... ET 'gods', hybrid races, and negative non-physical entities are at the root of all these discussions. Satanism/Luciferianism are afflictions by Archons/demons. There is no actual 'satan'. Beings such as Isis/Osiris are with the light forces and the angelic beings, who oppose the negative opposition groups here on Earth.

            Edit: the OP has some instructions upon entering that I don't think anyone ever did: go to this tunnel, go in it, walk 200 meters to the right, take the first stairs downwards, then walk 50 meters further right, then you will see a metal door, this door is locked, but leads to a tunnel that is connected to the underground facility at comet ping pong. do not ask me how I know this, just go

            Edit again: there was an anon that was going to check it out, but his unique ID doesn't turn up in another thread. He did find the door though.

            Easter didn't come from Ishtar. Eostre is not Ishtar (very different goddesses from different countries). And it's only English and German speaking Christians who refer to the celebration of Jesus' resurrection as "Easter." Nearly everyone else uses a variation on Pesach (Paschal).
Although it comes at around the same time as Easter (indeed, the Last Supper was probably a Pesach seder), it is not Easter.
According to the Venerable Bede (7th century), The word Easter does not come directly from the deity Eostre, but from the fact that the celebration of the resurrection usually falls in what in Bede's time was still called Eostremonth ( now April), even though it had been centuries since the Anglo Saxons had worshiped Eostre the month still bore her name. This seems reasonable enough, since we still use the names of Roman, Greek, and Nordic gods for the names of some of our months and days.

             Thank you...cakeoflightylight  needs to study history as to why Catholics and Orthodox Christians don't celebrate Pascha on the same day, and why they are not in communion with each other.
            </p>
            <p>
             Pascha, what Westerners know only as ..."Easter and the holidays that are related to it are moveable feasts, in that they do not fall on a fixed date in the Gregorian or Julian calendars (both of which follow the cycle of the sun and the seasons). Instead, the date for Easter is determined on a lunisolar calendar similar to the Hebrew calendar. The First Council of Nicaea (325) established two rules, independence of the Jewish calendar and worldwide uniformity, which were the only rules for Easter explicitly laid down by the Council. No details for the computation were specified; these were worked out in practice, a process that took centuries and generated a number of controversies. (See also Computus and Reform of the date of Easter.) In particular, the Council did not decree that Easter must fall on Sunday. This was already the practice almost everywhere.[49][incomplete short citation]
In Western Christianity, using the Gregorian calendar, Easter always falls on a Sunday between 22 March and 25 April inclusive, within about seven days after the astronomical full moon.[50] The following day, Easter Monday, is a legal holiday in many countries with predominantly Christian traditions."

             All pagan holidays originate from the same Satanic roots, and the Catholic church covered up Pope Constantine's high priesthood in the Pagan mysteries by appropriating all Paganism into "Christianity" so yes Easter does originate from Ishtar, who is the same icon as Lilith, Semiramis, Isis, and the "different" goddesses under different names after the fall of Babylon when according to the Bible, God supposedly scattered the people by making them all suddenly speak different languages. Regardless, it's a Satanic holiday that even the Satanists are debating about as we speak.

              The problem with your brief histrionic account of history is that it's incomplete, misleading, uniformed, and incorrect on several counts.  It makes me not want to take seriously any of info you offer that might be worthwhile.
