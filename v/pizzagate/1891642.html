<p><strong>Excerpt:</strong></p>
<p><em>Seth Rich died after he was shot multiple times on the 2100 block of Flagler Place NW which is three blocks east of Howard University Hospital and six minutes away from MedStar Washington Hospital Center. The Washington D.C. police report says Seth Rich survived the initial shootings and died later at</em> <strong><em>the hospital.</em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em>There have been no reports</em></strong> <em>on which hospital he was taken to, but</em> <strong><em>common sense indicates</em></strong> <em>it would have had to been Medstar Washington Hospital Center.</em></p>
<p><em>Howard University Hospital is closer and has an emergency room, but not for trauma surgery so Seth Rich</em> <strong><em>had to have</em></strong> <em>been taken to MedStar Washington Hospital Center.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<p><strong>QUESTIONS:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Am I correct in saying that information about THE HOSPITAL where Rich was taken for treatment remains UNCONFIRMED?</strong> If so, why? To protect that hospital from harassment/something else? Is there some other reasonable explanation? Same questions apply to <strong>THE EMS/ambulance service</strong>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Is postitive confirmation of the hospital important? If so, is anyone in the media asking for this information be made public? Are there any reports that explain, or even speculate, <strong>WHY</strong> the hospital hasn\'t been confirmed?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Are we 100% certain, beyond any doubt, that Seth Rich was taken to a hospital at all?</p>
</li>
</ol>
<hr />
<p>Make no mistake, I\'m NOT questioning any research being done on Medstar WHC, Dr. Sava, etc. In fact, I think we need a whole lot MORE of it.</p>

            Maybe we don't know specific facts about which hospital he was taken to ......because he's not dead.

             I had been thinking that assange had been stashed, but now he is back in London/Ecuador. So if SR had to go into hiding why faux kill him? Or you think the shooting was legit and he was stolen from the hospital post assassination attempt?

              Yes and yes. There are possibilities that it was a set-up. Sometimes the spooks would actually shot each othe ( not more than a superficial hit)....if they became ' compromised '. I know,,,,I'm medical....I treated them &amp;e-vac'd them out. 
This is beginning to look the same. Patterns are really revealing.

              Let me run this by you: my therory...
sethrich Eric braverman, are being stashed somewhere by the doj....so the Clinton Crime Syndicate can't touch them.
They are using george webb's vid series as a big diversion. I spent time in military during Ronnie's admin. &amp; worked with those spooks (iran/contra) to know how they roll. George webb has made enough remarks, about "speaking russian" ,etc. to make me believe he is a plant. I love his series....but it's mostly fiction. 
Most of these actors are Jewish. .....somethings not kosher in Denmark. 
I know that sounds a bit far fetched , but opinions are like a-holes.....we all have them.

                Thank you for that affirmation. 
I know SETH is alive......his parents should have buried him in accordance with hebrew law. ....48hrs after his death. Just watch their interview.  Do they look like grieving parents? ????? HE'S ALIVE!!!!
WATCH REALLY GRACEFUL VID.....AND HER LAST COMMENTS. Nuff said .

            How about phoning accounts and say you think you owe them money.  Rich SC deceased.  Is there any money outstanding?  Yes, we had a Seth Rich - bills paid.  Or no record.

            Do you want to know how bad we are screwed and surrounded by psychopaths?
           </p>
           <p>
            Because these blatant crimes go by unchecked and the only "investigations" done refuse to pursue OBSTRUCTION OF JUSTICE CHARGES and they refuse to go after the little guys spinning lies and hiding facts about their butt buddies.

            This is all a circus. Real investigations with serious investigators get to the bottom of things.

            That report by the 4th year attending Dr must have been a limited hangout.  The story was thrown out there to get us to find out how he really died and why he was guarded by the cops.  In reality, this may have all been done to hide the fact he was never at that hospital in the first place.

              So Killary orders a hit and the guy's not dead!  There has to be a lot of scrambling to finish the deed.

              Was Sava the original attending physician?  Or did he take over the case?  Or did some SEIU janitor or nurse evil put the proverbial pillow over his head?

             <p>
              And if he was operating a computer connection from the disused hospital, it was presumably before he was shot - or not.

            DC Witness  is an online news site dedicated exclusively to reporting on each and every homicide  within city limits. So I guess when it says it mistakenly reported that Seth was taken to Howard University Hospital, we can infer that he was taken to Medstar  WHC. Still it's weird that DC Witness failed to report just what hospital he was taken to.  Why the secrecy?  I wonder if DC Witness  is staying on top of this story. That is one of their missions.

             Appears someone from /pol contacted DC Witness to ask about this and apparently they had 'assumed' the hospital name, and then changed their blog post so as not spread disinfo.

            for all the work here so far. Don't like to

            The only lead I've seen surrounding the hospital seth was taken to was one user's speculation on 4chan, but I'll post what I remember about it here because it seemed worth checking into.

            One of the people who were
            <a href="https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/49435">
             sent the email
            </a>
            about how Tamara Luzzatto about having her children playing in the pool is a certain "
            <a class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="8dcfe2e3e3e4e8a3c1e8fbe4e3cde0e8e9fef9ecffa3e3e8f9" href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection">
             [email protected]
            </a>
            " who works for Medstar Hospital (as "Corporate AVP, Pharmacy Services, MedStar Health").
           </p>
           <p>
            I found voat posts about this, but the 4chan poster alleged that her husband works there too
           </p>
           <p>
            I also saw that poster say that her husband was a doctor for Medstar, however I'm having trouble proving this connection now (or even finding out who her husband is). I think this is worth looking into though, she's got connections to the podesta's through her ties to Tamara Luzzatto and she happens to work at the "common sense" option for what hospital he went to.

             Good. The more high-profile attention/questions/requests, the better. It's disturbing, how the media's -
             <em>
              STOP asking questions/drop the investigation,
             </em>
             <strong>
              <em>
               for the sake of the family
              </em>
             </strong>
             - narrative has become routine, and how agenda-driven people are buying into it.

             What did Vanity Fair know about in Jan 16 about Hillary "Killing a Panda"?  Is this a link to the DNC data NGP VAN data bug/breach in Dec 15?

             For the second time in eight years, Hillary Clinton sees the Democratic nomination being pawed by a charming interloper, like a priceless vase grabbed by a panda. She’d prefer to shoot the panda, but that could mean breaking the vase, and onlookers would object. To make matters worse, Bernie Sanders, who leads Clinton in both New Hampshire and Iowa, has produced a new video ad, “America,” a wordless feel-hope montage that is awfully good, good enough that I can’t help feeling both moved by it and resentful that it works on me. Maybe shoot the panda.

            Question: Is this beginning to point to his being put into witness protection? Just a thought as it would be consistent with some of what we are seeing.

             If he were put in witness protection, then they would have found a lackey (some random crack addicit, for ezample) to pin the crime on. Leaving it unsolved has caused too much commotion.

              Probably right, but the whole thing seems to implicate federal protection...of the perpetrators at a minimum.

               that came from 4chan. Personally I don't think they are related. it involves a gold astro van which does not say assassin getaway vehicle to me. I think that the Stolen FBI Weapons is also an unrelated story. BUT,  I really know nothing.

             sorry - no. they are not put online until they are about ~100 yrs old and  the policy varies with every state / jurisdiction.
            </p>
            <p>
             Even after they reach the age limit, not all states / counties have a way to put them online.
            </p>
            <p>
             I've only seen a few states do it and they are only old ones  - like I said - about 100yrs.

            Any one connected to the cousin on social media, could ask for the death cert?  Don't hold out much hope, but if he's invested in solving the case.... there could be a possibility ?

             I've searched the web for hours, without finding a single lead. Only LOTS of references to
             <strong>
              THE hospital.
             </strong>
             And a
             <strong>
              remarkable lack of curiosity
             </strong>
             . Few people are asking these questions, and those that
             <strong>
              are
             </strong>
             don't seem adamant about finding answers. Hoping to find some help and new ideas here. I'll bring everything else I can think of.

               by retracting Howard Hospital as the wrong one, this kind of leaves Washington Hospital Center as the correct one by default.
              </p>
              <p>
               I bet a PR person at Howard saw the story and requested a retraction since they didn't have the patient.

            Brilliant synopsis, excellent post.  I noticed this too... always 'the hospital'.  Super-strange. I don't know what we can do however... dig for a hospital when there's no mention of it?  What can we do here?

               Now, listen here is another think I came up on.  The third link had a picture in the little video of the Flagler Market where those cameras were that filmed only the feet of the "attackers".  I am going to also give a link here of a pic I found when just typing in Flagler Market and you can see those very cameras.  Here.

             </strong>
             The link is long for there are 5 pics included you will see the one with the cameras.  I think this is very important.  Also the third link has an article and a video of a really good reporter and he talked to Mary Rich on his call phone.  Hope you look at these.  Thanks.

                 Aargh!  Forgot to archive!  I should probably have look at them too, now!
I particularly liked the "Make calls, BECOME the media" by

                <p>
                 I feel tempted to just call the two hospitals and ask if they dealt with Seth Rich.  Each conversation is a potential lead.  They might even leak to
                 <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/v/pizzagate">

                 after you put the phone down if you mention the interest over here and how to follow it.  And if half a dozen of us all phone asking the same question, telephonists are bored, telephonists are curious and people love to gossip.
                </p>
                <p>
                 What's the worst that can happen?  [Yeah!  I know - suicided].  Or they might say, "I can't tell you anything, but Dr Sava was the attending, do you want to put me through?

                    Nope.  For a hospital to reveal whether or not they treated someone is a violation of federal law, specifically HIPAA.

                     I don't think that's necessarily entirely true (simply regarding whether they're there or not) although, specific medical info is protected. I looked into this a little and found some info, but a lawyer would surely understand these things in greater depth. For instance, what defines a
                     <em>
                      loved one?

                       loved one
                      </strong>

                      Under the HIPAA Privacy Rule, if you ask for a
                      <strong>
                       loved one
                      </strong>
                      by name, a hospital or medical facility can usually tell you if he or she is a patient at its facility.[iii] - (iii refers to 45 CFR 164.510, see below)
                     </p>
                     <p>
                      There are instances, however, when a hospital or medical facility will not be able to tell you if your loved one is a patient at its facility, such as when your loved one instructs the hospital not to disclose any information about him or her, or when the hospital maintains a policy of not revealing any patient information, unless otherwise directed by the patient.
                      <strong>
                       (Such a policy is not required under the Privacy Rule, but has been adopted by some hospitals.)

              Now, listen here is another think I came up on. The third link had a picture in the little video of the Flagler Market where those cameras were that filmed only the feet of the "attackers". I am going to also give a link here of a pic I found when just typing in Flagler Market and you can see those very cameras. Here.

               Are you saying you did those over for me?  So sorry, everyone.  My talents lie in research, I am pretty dumb when it comes to links.
I hope I did not confuse everyone.  Thanks you.

                 If that means they are good, thank you.  If that is tech talk for too long, a thousand pardons!  One thing that has been on my mind, is my researching St. Louis.  I searched day and night on organ harvesting.One thing I learned (as many others have too) is that they will not ever lose one single dollar when they can make one.  I am hating to say this, but if at all possible I think they would have tried to steal Seth's organs.  I don't even have the heart to ask those parents a question like that.  I wonder if on the DC or Autopsy Report it would state his weight at time of death.  Oh this is hard.

                  not tech talk, just appreciation. I see your efforts and remain inspired. I agree that Seth's organs were very likely harvested. He was probably a donor.  Many, many years ago my brother told me not to be a donor because in a car accident they won't try to save you and I thought he was kidding

                   Wow.  I never thought of that aspect.  I heard that some states are making it mandatory with the responsibility of the people to opt out.  What if you are not aware that law has passed?  This must stop.  We are being robbed of our innards and that is so very sick.  No way will I ever volunteer any parts knowing what they have been up to.

                    Last time I had to go to the DMV for a photo update they asked me if I wanted to be a donor. It happened that Cheney was in the news for a new heart, I asked the woman, can you make sure my heart doesn't go to Dick? and she said no, so I said no. She laughed and said good choice.

                     Wow.  What a story.  I would be glad to donate my heart or anything to a poor person.  The rich think they are entitled.  They have spent years trying to brainwash people into believing we are not "entitled"  to  our  "entitlements".  Well that is exactly what we are entitled to.  Our money.  We are entitled to our money.  They are not entitled to our organs so they can living longer and steal more organs and OUR money. Nope.

             the more we see, the more I realize we are living in a plastic bubble society where information is fluid - lost and found on a whim. power is bought and sold like a jar of peanut butter...  ?     really??

            This is why I keep posting that the parents need to produce Seth's death certificate.  It would reveal a lot of these basic details.  If the parents CARE about finding Seth's killers, they should CARE enough to produce a simple document.  The parents either already have the death certificate or can request it.

              no - not in the usa.  the records are kept pretty tight. rules are set at the county and state levels (Counties may have some say in the matter - I'm not sure - but each state has it's own rules).

             <p>
              unless of course, if a forgery has to be produced like in the case of the obama birth certificate.  then, it follows a different procedure altogether.

             I agree... however it appears that they're under the control of the black hand of Soros / Bauman / DNC.  Would there be any public record of the death cert ?
             <strong>
              Or any Med / Public Record Anons willing to leak maybe ????

              ok I just looked up the procedure. the DC is only public after 50 years unless there is a relationship or other legal interest. there is a fee involved and you need a bunch of id and documentation proving your relationship or legal interest. 
Seems to me that a huge reward for information necessary to resolve a crime is sufficient legal interest, and since it is a crime, maybe a FOIA would be another way to get it.

               Good to know this. Any idea how long a FOIA takes to come through?

               I think we're counting on a MedAnon / PublicRecordAnon to help us here... seems we're at a road block. I don't know what else we can try.

                a FIOA is supposed to be responded to within a set timeframe but if the request is denied it would require a lawsuit. Maybe Judicial Watch is requesting this, didn't someone post recently that JW issued a subpoena for Seth Rich information? Perhaps the easiest thing to do is ask Aaron Rich for a copy via the GoFund me page.

                 Wow.  What a great idea.  We have such smart people on here.  We are all working together to bring this to an end.  I have a really good feeling about all our work.  I think we will hit pay dirt soon.  If not the end results, I feel we will arrive at something important this weekend, I can feel it in my bones.

             Well I would guess they know their son was bumped off. And I also believe they know it'll happen to them, as they have been surrounded via spokes people they don't even agree with.
