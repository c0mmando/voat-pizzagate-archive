            I was thinking that we need a website where we can post a flow diagram or something similar showing all the connections of these people.  It would be easier to digest visual information.  Anyone know of such a site or how to build one?
           </p>
           <p>
            Let me find an example of what I mean.

              There is a patent about organizing information for medical school, for example.  I will have to find it again.

              Essentially, a person is like a node, and is connected to other people/nodes.  It is like a huge molecule that can be rotated.  You can also zoom in and out to show different levels of details.
             </p>
             <p>
              I am glad that others are working on this.  I am not a programmer.
             </p>
             <p>
              I will post that patent after I find it.

            the owners of some of the top b&amp;m casinos are privy to shady business dealings and they are not worthy to have internet poker licenses. It is to also show that they shouldn't have Nevada/New Jersey Licenses either. To show that they have a long history of bribing officials and both they and the NFL have ties to the DOJ. They have history of illicit dealings, motive, and are responsible for our money being frozen by DOJ.
           </p>
           <p>
            all the major casinos are a monopoly already and plan to be one online too. All the major players are tied to Michael Milken and other questionable characters. They have history of obtaining investment of state pension funds to finance their buyouts.

             Eli Black "jumped" out of a NY skyscraper window just like Frank Olson:

             The CIA used the same playbook on Black as it did on Olson. How do you break a heavy duty skyscraper window with your briefcase and the briefcase follow you out the window ?

             This shows a lot of dedicated research, thanks.Casinos come in handy when laundering money plus Black is heavy into art investment.  Also, Leon Black owns Chuck E Cheese, serves a lot of pizza to kids, no? He even looks like the mascot.

             Diamond has a lot of pending lawsuits especially for ripping off seniors.  Amazing with Black's ties to Jeffrey Epstein, not only though MIT gifts but Epstein running Blacks foundation for years.

             Leon Black is dirty AF and Apollo will hopefully be seized.  Hilton Board should fight this tooth and nail.
