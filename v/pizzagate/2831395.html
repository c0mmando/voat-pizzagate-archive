<p>Ouachita Parish sheriff’s investigators arrested a man on suspicion of indecent behavior with a juvenile and sexual battery last week after a juvenile in the suspect’s youth group at church reported being sexually abused.</p>
<p>Zane Thomas Poole, Monroe, was booked at Ouachita Correctional Center on the charges after a  warrant was issued for his arrest.
According to the warrant, the juvenile victim’s father submitted a complaint to authorities in late August. The alleged sexual abuse occurred in 2015.</p>
<p>The juvenile victim met Poole at First United Methodist Church through a youth group at the church when she was 12 and Poole was 18. According to her interview with investigators, Poole communicated inappropriately with her via text message and Snapchat.</p>
<p>“On Sunday and Wednesday nights, while attending youth group, Poole, who was a youth leader, would take (the victim) to a stairwell in the church, where he knew there would be no video, and kiss and fondle her,” stated the warrant.
Poole made sexual demands, which the victim refused, she said. Pool continued battering her sexually and making inappropriate demands of her, she said.</p>
<p>“Eventually, (the victim) developed anorexia and other health problems which led to her telling her parents about the relationship with Poole,” stated the warrant.
Church staff confronted Poole about the allegations, according to the warrant, but Poole only admitted to touching the victim on a bus.
“Poole was dismissed from the youth group and barred from having further contact with the youth group at that time,” stated the warrant.</p>

            Wisconsin University took part in MKUKTRA. 
Probably still does. Young female students have disappeared.
           </p>
           <p>
            Fort Worth in Wisconsin also received funds for MKULTRA projects. 
Wisconsin was settled by a lot of Germans,  many bought their occult and communist/nazi beliefs with them.  More were settled there during operation paperclip. 
Fort Worth also received one of the UFOs from Roswell? 
Wisconsin has the hightest number of occult groups in the USA.
           </p>
           <p>
            Anton LeVay is said to have created the Devils Mountain cult in Manitowoc,  the town were Steve Avery was falsely gaoled for rape (I believed the cult attacked Penny Bernstein,  based on witness Dave B). 
He was then set up for the murder of Theresa Halbach.
            <br/>
            There is a series running on this case as his lawyer tries to free him and his nephew.
           </p>
           <p>
            The lodge associated with the rape is The Fraternity of the Order of Eagles (706 I think).
           </p>
           <p>
            There is a lot of satanic stuff happening in Wisconsin. 
Also several reports of LE running down cyclists causing death.

            Freemasonric irish lodge was pioneered by the earl of ross who was o d of the founders of hell fire club ..
The irish lodge history is that it is the main lodge and probably took over the other lodges...
It is the seed of lodges in the thirld world where it was associated with the british army soldiers and indian maharajas..who historically known for their sociopathy..
..
Freemasonry are the real pirates that run the gearing system of all the five estates that make up modern roman pirate corporations called countries...
           </p>
           <p>
            It is no suprise that the fueling system of the debt machine has the freemasonic symbols...its their game ..and thry own it while we r inside it...
They want their players ..without us as players they csnnot receive the fuel of debt ..that funds their criminal recreatiin service ...
           </p>
           <p>
            I have a cheque drwn on deatsche bank ...should i deposit ie lend it to a freemsonic aligned templar banking system runni g a debt war game ...or do i reduce debt at the US treadury and turn the war machine that they r using against us in the war of terror...around and work it towards reducing debt..
At the same time i will get out of their statutues system..that privides false securities and guarantees ..
And also ..activate universal jurisdictiin ...
To be able to force the US war machi e to fight the real war of terror against the deep state ...
Questiin to u alefantis ?
I know u r here making sure the kill room at pegasus museum isnt touched upon...
