            Why aren't people linking PTSD ( post-traumatic stress disorder)  and adrenochrome (adrenalised blood) together?  PTSD is caused by the same kind of adrenaline that is contained in adrenochrome being released in your brain when you think you are going to die. I suppose to give you that one last push to see if you can make it. This adrenaline is different than the kind that is released when driving a fast car or even jumping out of an airplane. This kind is like poison. It poisons your brain. PTSD is a physiological condition that can cause hallucinations and flashbacks.  So,  I wonder what long term  effect it has on someone who is continually ingesting this same poisonous substance for recreational purposes?

            I normally agree with the flairs but this one's a bit sketchy.  Adrenochrome does appear to be a "thing" based on my research.

            The inheritance of Abraham is based on bloodline, but the Zionists associate that land with the state of Israel, i.e. Genesis 15:18 vs the Oded Yinon plan.

             The Zionists are the Fake Jews Jesus warns about about in the New Testament and calls the Synagogue of Satan. There are actual genectic Jews living in Israel but most have been extinguished. The majority of other "Jews" are Ashkenazi and are not Jews except by conversion to Mystical Talmudic Judaism &amp; Kaballah they were forced to choose as a religious identification. These are not Torah Jews in fact if you research the origins of the writing of the Talmud you might be surprised it was originally only an oral presentation or mystical experience.

             This group of people immigrated from the Khazar region to become whatcis know as the Khazarian mafia and the central bankers ala the Rothschilds. They were supporters of both WWI and then fully supported Hitler and the Nazis in Germany. In fact there is good reason to believe Hiteler might be a Rothschild. His mother was a maid in Baron Rothschilds home while her husband was away at war and she became pregnant. She had Adolph several months after his return but to early for him to be Adolph's father. All signs pointed to Baron Rothschild who is believed to have supported Adolph along his path even though he took his step father Alois Hitler's last name.

             Anyway back to Canaan leads us to the story of Cain and Able. As we know Cain the second born slain his brother Able in Damascus, Syria to steal the inheritance. Now biblical scholars will say there are many many messages in these passages explaining the meaning for the present day. Able was the first begotten son of Adam who was God's first creation, Cain was conceived after Mary was tempted by the serpent (devil) in the garden and she became pregnant with Vain.
            </p>
            <p>
             Cain was sent to the land of Cannon which would by come know for devil worship, hedonistic practices, and cannibalism including child sacrifice and drinking their blood.
            </p>
            <p>
             This I believe is the answer these people or strains of them have survived and need this unique bloodtype to stay alive.

            That's what I meant Canaan....sorry I really do know how to spell have my reasons...anyway yes I know it is not isolated to Canaan and I know the topic has been brought up in numerous ways before trying to help people understand bloodlines and genetics especially as it relates to that area of the world. You don't think those of us who know this already can adequately provide education? If not here what sub because I know several who can contribute.

            Perhaps the true nature of the value of blood, is indeed a discussion best saved for a more appropriate time though?

            It's always important, but I think M_F is at least right to flare a video that barely scratches the surface and which indeed could defeat any future talks.

            again, yes, there's plenty to be said about blood and I for one welcome the discussion in the right place at the right time(not saying that here and now isn't it, though).

            no fucking shit, they were drunk and on LSD, of course exogenous(externally introduced) adrenochrome is going to have a profound effect.

            Everything we ingest, technically, is psychoactive - to talk about what blood does in relation to taking it as an augment to ritual, is a MUCH larger discussion to be had.

            I think you are doing a disservice to this researcher community by automatically deleting or flailing this. There is more to adrenochrome than is being allowed out in the open and researchers should have a chance to put the pieces together. We have been trying for months but get deleted.

In the DVD commentary, director Terry Gilliam admits that his and Thompson's portrayal is a fictional exaggeration. In fact, Gilliam insists that the drug is entirely fictional and seems unaware of the existence of a substance with even a similar

              If the account of it's effects was exaggerated then that is still confirmation that it has been used as a psychoactive substance.

                What I mean is that for something to be exaggerated it has to exist in the first place. At any rate, the significant thing about adrenochrome is its association with schizophrenia, given that inducing a dissociative identity disorder in the subject seems to be a central goal of SRA.

              Hunter Thompson was involved in child sex trafficking and snuff films of children with the elite including at Bohemian Grove. Paul Bonnaci is an eye witness and living victim to this and has testified to it. The adrenochrome was alluded to in the movie fFear and Loathing based on his real life experience. Do you think Wikipedia or Gilliam are going to tell you that? No way they in fact make the opposite claim that it is fictional death would come rapid to them otherwise.

             have you seen the list of deleted submissions by millenial falcon ? he is ruining voat. they should rethink his position as a mod. i dont post anymore because of him. fyi. the deleted submissions by mf are better than the main posts that are left. i hate censorship. and especially when its with impunity. feels like we're living in a concentration camp. as i said yesterday you can check out all the submissions mf has deleted in the right hand bottom corner of voats page under moderation logs. removed submissions. theres a fucking ton of them. all mf.

               He also banned people simply because he suspected them of being a particular poster - that had nothing to do with the rules. What tin foil hat shit are you talking about, exactly?

               If this Adrenochrome aspect is misdirection, hoax, or false, the more discussion or 'light' shed upon it will show this to be the case.
The very fact that it is quickly shunted aside in this forum, and virtually ignored everywhere else, are - in fact - the very hallmarks that something of substance is in play.
Why are there so many bathtubs in the Podesta and ilks' pictures?
To facilitate clean up? Capture blood?
Why terrorize children to begin with?
As Cathy O'Brien has said at the end of this video ... Truth always emerges eventually.

                I think you're misunderstanding me(at least) here. I am WELL aware(painfully so) of the effects of blood(the concoction as a whole; body chemistry, presence of drugs/trauma, etc), but the discussion about it is hard to fully and concisely relate in a single(or even a few) post, without making pizzagate a bit 'NSFW' or otherwise offputting for so-called normies.

                Is it a central point? absofuckingloutely, but, there are better approaches to the discussion than the video which this thread was started by.

            Flairing as disinfo as adrenochrome is a disinfo hoax and has no desirable effects as a drug.  See Erowid for experiences of people who tried it for proof it does nothing.  (Feel free to prove me wrong. Protip: you can't.)

             Adrenochrome is a member of a class of chemicals known as aminochromes, each one derived by the oxidation of its precursor amine.

             It was to
             <em>
              my
             </em>
             understanding that HST made the whole thing up. If I remember correctly, on one of the audio commentaries for the film version of "Fear &amp; Loathing..." (One features director Terry Gilliam, the other HST), they spoke of getting together and trying to figure out what Adrenachrome actually would do, how it would look, how it tasted, and, needless to say, the effects. The implication being that it. doesn't. exist. Adrenachrome, that is.
            </p>
            <p>
             Of course, it
             <em>
              could
             </em>
             just be more obfuscation. I mean, everyone listens to Director Commentary over the movie, right? /s

            <p>
             That isn't to say certain groups
             <em>
              aren't
             </em>
             trying to harvest adrenaline. I'm sure you'd get pretty fucked up. But Adrenachrome, as understood in the writings of Hunter Stockton Thompson, is a figment of our collective imagination.

             Given our foe in all this is into sadistic pleasure and into the occult, there may be a valid to talk about this.

             What's important here is what THEY believe. Thus we could use this stuff from a perspective of "get into their heads". Do that and you can predict what they'll do and their motives for doing it.
            </p>
            <p>
             Its what I keep saying...."flip the chess board". I know trying to get into the heads of sadistic, satanic psychopaths is a dangerous and sickening thought for those with weak stomachs and weak will power (so as to not go insane), but we gotta do what we gotta do to stop them.

              The whole notion of people harvesting blood to use adrenochrome as a drug is disinformation.  Any normie who actually looks it up will find that adrenochrome has no desirable drug effects.  Hence this is effective disinfo to turn normies away from pizzagate.  For that matter, the entire blood harvesting narrative (whether there is any truth to it or not) serves the same purpose, because there is no actual evidence for it, and it reeks of "ERMAGERD VAMPIRES."

             Schizophrenia is relevant because of its similarity to the dissociative identity disorder which is sought in SRA.
