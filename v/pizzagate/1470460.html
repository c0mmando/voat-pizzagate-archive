<p>This is driving me absolutely fucking mad. I\'m losing sleep. My girlfriend thinks she\'s less important to me. I obsess day and night piling through the mountain of evidence that seems to get bigger every hour. I\'m downloading, copying, archiving, making sure everything is still around by the time these people decide to force us into a war. It\'s more than just a conspiracy theory; there\'s just too much of it. I\'m a UFO nut and even I can admit to having two, maybe three credible pieces of evidence among thousands of hoaxes. But this...what the fuck is this? </p>
<p>I know people personally who dig their heads into the sand, be it colored red or blue, shrugging the whole thing off as &quot;alt-right Trump nonsense&quot; and &quot;fake&quot; and &quot;Russians,&quot; etc. etc. et-fucking-c. Any time I bring it up, I get scoffs and sighs of disappointment. The brainwashing is unreal. </p>
<p>I\'m not even a Trump supporter. I think the guy is a fucking idiot. Hiring a bunch of assholes, failing to &quot;MAGA&quot; or &quot;Drain the Swamp&quot; -- propaganda phrases that are equally as nonsensical as &quot;Fake News&quot; He\'s been to Epstein\'s island too, for fuck sake! This has nothing to do with supporting a political party or whatever the fuck &quot;alt right&quot; means (remember when Republicans suddenly became &quot;The GOP&quot; to make them look like a bunch of phased-out hillbillies?) And &quot;The Russians?&quot; What is this, fucking McCarthyism? </p>
<p>It\'s easy for the mainstream media to point the finger at awful tabloid news sites -- and they are awful -- only because they have the balls to report on something people are talking about. Thing is, nobody is getting this information from &quot;Fake News,&quot; or any news for that matter; they are getting it from DIRECT SOURCES, in most cases straight from the horse\'s fucking mouth. A picture of three half-naked adolescents with ritual masks and you\'re telling me that was made up by fake news? No, fuck face, Alefantis himself took that God damn picture. Even if you want to say the &quot;emails are fake,&quot; you can\'t look at someone\'s photographs, not to mention the metric shit-tons of evidence piling up over the course of at least 60 years, and say, &quot;The Russians faked it for Trump.&quot; </p>
<p>The problem might be the name Pizzagate. People look at the name &quot;Pizzagate&quot; and think that &quot;Pizza&quot; is the only thing everyone is obsessing about, therefore this is all silly. Yes, Hillary ate a lot of *actual *pizza on the campaign. I\'m sure a lot of politicians do. It\'s a quick and easy fix for hunger while you\'re constantly on the move. I\'m not saying change the name, because I get it. It\'s just the term for making people aware, not the entire case. But there\'s got to be a way to get people to see past the surface. Even the infographics, aesthetically, look like a load of bullshit when viewed as thumbnails. Hell, I wouldn\'t click them either.</p>
<p>The most success I\'ve had is pulling up creepy photos from Alefantis, passing it to a friend and saying &quot;Hey, don\'t jump to conclusions okay? This is totally fake...&quot; Each thing I show is worse than the last, and I keep the sarcasm going especially if I get a reaction. &quot;No no, don\'t act like that. This is just art. Totally fake. The Russians did it. See this? Just some kids having fun. Stop! You\'re jumping to conclusions!&quot; Trolling works, for some reason.</p>
<p>So before I end this rant, I\'m going to make that suggestion. Try presenting it AS fake news. Tell people it\'s fake, then show it to them. That way, they\'ll at least fucking LOOK AT IT. That\'s all we want. Just fucking look at it. No arguments, no political discussions, just look at it and think for yourself. But for fuck sake, don\'t jump to any conclusions.</p>
<p>Sorry, I\'m just venting. Back to my original point: It\'s driving me nuts. I want this train to stop. I want this to be resolved peacefully. Please, God, let it be resolved peacefully.</p>',

            Ive just learned to accept the madness. The less control you have over how it affects you, the less credible you will seem to those around you, and your findings more easily dismissed.

            Well OP makes some good points.
           </p>
           <p>
            Let's review. The
            <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/the">
             /r/the
            </a>
            -donald 'maga' are alt-tard nuts, a new form of faggotry just look at their poster boys seaman, milo, &amp; alefantis; note that everyone is a faggot or jewish faggot?
           </p>
           <p>
            Then the spin off pizzagate on /r, later banned jumps over to /voat, funny thing is that its all fed all along by 4chan, like FBIanon and all orginal 'pizzagate', so the OP is correct one big stupid MEME invented by real pedos (4chan ppl), and real psyop( 4chan is owned by navy-intel )
           </p>
           <p>
            Now the good news, pizzagate has awoken ppl to the reality and scope of child-trafficking worldwide, this is good, entire world is talking about it, about time.
           </p>
           <p>
            Trump can't stop his boys now,  Alex Jone can't stop, its like nobody can get Humpty-Dumpty off the wall, the entire world has gone pizzagate viral, greatest show on earth.
           </p>
           <p>
            It has villains ( elite rich ), it has victims ( babys, white baby's ppl love them ), it has all the right stuff.
           </p>
           <hr/>
           <p>
            Who can channel the witch-hunt? Nobody, it now like all "madness of the crowds" has taken a life of its own,
           </p>
           <p>
            I think Flynn-Jr said it best "follow all leads no matter how insane until proven false"
           </p>
           <p>
            Trump will NOT drain the  swamp, but we little people can. Pizzagate investigates where did the 8million children worldwide go, and who runs the satanic OP, who R they, no stone un-turned.
           </p>
           <p>
            INSANE? Hell Yes

            I went through my obsessive phase, then finally had the "a-ha" epiphany moment that the truth, more then likely, lies somewhere in the middle - meaning pizzagate is not NOTHING, but I'm not all obsessed over it anymore.
           </p>
           <p>
            Having a calm, non-conspiracy minded friend helped me think rationally without attacking me. I bet a lot of us on this site have a tendency to believe in a lot more conspiracy theories then this one..
           </p>
           <p>
            I think Alefantis made be a pedofile, and Podesta too.. but I don't know that Comet Ping Pong is the hub of a Saudi-owned Child-trafficking ring, where they are butchering, raping, and eating babies - and disposing of the remaining evidence at the cleaners across the street. Just sayin.

            I sympathize. I started reading Wikileaks on Nov 1st after seeing Steve Piecznik's videos. By Nov 8th, I talked to a therapist about this.I couldn't deal with the thought that Clinton/Podesta might return to full power. In fact, even though I thought poorly of Trump, and even though I live in a completely "blue" state and so my vote wouldn't matter one way or another, I voted Trump instead of my usual 3rd party protest vote, So I know where you're at.
           </p>
           <p>
            The therapist offered some helpful suggestions. For example, remember the good things in my life; focus on other issues and tasks; spend some time away, doing things that amuse or please me; and remember that this is not my fault or my responsibility. That doesn't mean stop caring or helping, just don't let it comsume or destroy you.
           </p>
           <p>
            Good luck, and God bless.

            Courage my friend! We've all gone through this horrible state of "feeling alone in the world" when diving into pizzagate. You are not alone. I am the most self confident person you can think of, with dream career by many standards and fantastic girlfriend, though, ... for the first time in 15 years, it put me down for an entire week and I ended up isolated from my girlfriend, friends and family.
           </p>
           <p>
            If it can help, a combination of three things helped me:
           </p>
           <ul>
            <li>
             <p>
              force myself to stop reading about it or anything related (The_Donald) for several days and take this time to go outside, meet friends and family. When you get back to pizzagate, set up a clear schedule to avoid getting more involved than you can stand.
             </p>
            </li>
            <li>
             <p>
              discuss it with my closest friends. Here I am lucky cause they all tend to "trust me" and they have this anti-establishment character, so it was not a very tough sell: they quickly started to search about it on their own and get the "passion". This part is risky as you might lose friends who don't have the right mindset.
             </p>
            </li>
            <li>
             <p>
              learn to accept that the media, corpos and politicians are corrupt, and that we should not take it personally: stop being triggered every time the media lies about "fake news", or when you see a new fake narrative being pushed by all this cohort of corrupt people. There are many uninformed people who have been brainwashed by those fake narratives since they were born - we have to live with this fact.
             </p>
            </li>
           </ul>
           <p>
            Those advices should help you keep your sanity and avoid isolating yourself more than now. Take breaks, force yourself to only do research once every day... and not before sleeping!

             WEIRD and CREEPY doesn't equal a crime. Just because something is outside of our comfort zone doesn't mean it's an indication of criminal activity.

             I know a lot of people who are really into horror movies - all kinds of blood and gore, doesn't make them serial killers.

            If you're a good actor who can keep a straight face, tell people about the #hotard and the girl taped to the table and then act dismissive. Most people will perk up at those details.

            Probably not the best idea to make a post about going nuts and losing sleep when your handle has "shooter" in it lol.

            I get it though. I feel a bit odd and bottled up myself since it feels like if I say too much, someone will think I'm insane. I feel like I'm watching a movie or in some freaky dream. Good point about spreading it as fake news just to get views.

            Also, please make sure you are taking care of yourself. There are thousands if not millions of others investigating this. I am seeing way too many posts about people driving themselves mad trying to convince people (who don't have the mental capacity or elasticity for it) that this is real. It's sad and it will decrease the amount of real mental energy we can put toward this effort. Take time away. Meditate (headspace is great). Understand the differences in people. Focus your energy efficiently.

            I'm with you on that, it's distracting me from work and sleep is just fucked i keep getting those creepy art pictures coming through but then i think of all these kids who don't stand a chance against this pure evil so it is all worth the cause and i think once we shut this down everyone can breathe a sigh of relief and sit back and know we did a good job unlike all the fucking SHILLS and MSM media out there fuckin protectors of the evil. Keep positive, go for a walk in nature and recharge, something to help clear the mind. We will win we are on the way!! Stay strong brother!

            This is the biggest test we have ever faced. Need to keep going. It's like the final boss in a game.. it's fucking hard but quitting just isn't an option.
