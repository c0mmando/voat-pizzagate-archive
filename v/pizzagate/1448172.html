<p>A. Claiming it has been debunked without actually addressing any of the hard evidence/facts/arguments;</p>

<p>B. Saying people who believe it are all Trump supporters, right-wing nuts, white nationalists and Hillary haters (therefore it must be nonsense/made-up);</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>C. Discrediting Alex Jones and Breitbart who have been more right than all the MSM combined, while citing the Slate\'s article, which does not address anything remotely relevant to the pizzagate\'s investigation, as proof.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>D. Most importantly, of all the great, informative pizzagate\'s videos out there, he decided to cite this video (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OrX0U4qwTM">PizzaGate Debunked</a>), which was uploaded 3 days ago with only 17 subscribers and 3000+views (LOL at the like/dislike ratio), as the main source of evidence to &quot;debunk&quot; the whole &quot;conspiracy&quot;. This leads me to believe that this article might be written by the same person who made this video himself, because this appears to be the only &quot;debunk&quot; video out there.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Conclusion:
The good news is it shows that our efforts actually paid off. First, the MSM ignored us. Then, they wrote articles showing none of our findings and just using their fake news narrative to discredit us; Now, they actually try to finally touch some of the specifics here. I believe if we try hard enough, we may finally force a &quot;meaningful conversation&quot; with the MSM and get this thing out to the general public.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The author of the article is also eager to know what we think about his work. Be sure to go comment on his article and the video (which cherrypicks small/irrelevant things to &quot;debunk&quot; without really looking into the real/hard evidence). If any of the youtubers who do pizzagate\'s videos can do a &quot;debunk the debunked&quot; video, it would be even better. Spread the words, guys!</p>',

            I consider it automatic that the corporate media is going to support the establishment. They are owned and operated by them. I don't find their damage control articles interesting, I find them obligatory and the opposite of being worthy of mention.
