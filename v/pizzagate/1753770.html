            The smear campaigns are one of their primary tools.
           </p>
           <p>
            Can't imagine today that anyone relating sexual abuse wouldn't be being believed.
           </p>
           <p>
            If you go back to Sigmund Freud, you see that he betrayed his own patients -- young males and females -- who confided in him their sexual abuse by fathers, grandfathers, uncles, male cousins -- and male friends of the family in the Oedipus Complex.
Freud also used the Oedipus Complex to lie to all the world in making the outrageous suggestion that it is infants and young toddlers and other young children who are the sexual aggressors against adult males.
           </p>
           <p>
            Some thought that Freud did this because of the power of patriarchal society and organized patriarchal religion at the time, but today many suspect that Freud himself was a child molester.

            This is a highly charged topic right now.  So many are just now waking up to the extent of these horrors that go back centuries.
I'm seeing some witch hunts like a man has a picture of fav meals, steak etc, one is pizza and other pictures with some kids he knows and it's The Invasion of the Body Snatchers lol...one of my fav movies as a kid (the original but the remake is pretty good too).
           </p>
           <p>
            So we have to keep on our toes and support each other.  None of this is easy for any of us.
           </p>
           <p>
            The shills and trolls are a GOOD SIGN.  Means we are hitting a nerve.  The gov doesn't pay them to target just any ol topic ya know :)  I really can't see this cat being put back in the bag and in that I find some relief.
           </p>

            Do something nice for yourself today~you deserve it!

            And personally...when I read she said her 2 year old daughter came home with
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             my two year old daughter after she was returned to me by her father, Igor Malenko, with a shredded vagina, screaming when she urinated because the sting of the alkaline in her urine hurt the cuts her father had made on her vagina when he raped her.
            </p>
           </blockquote>
           <p>
            the shredded vagina set me off like you can't imagine/hence my panic search about the child and I would have packed up my vehicle and left right then and there, period, found some place that did not have extradition and dealt with it from a safe place bc I don't trust authorities and I know really bad things can and do happen.  When my child's life would be at stake there is nothing that would keep me from getting her/him to safety.  No one would be looking for her to flee at that point and there are underground railroads that help mothers on the run if it came to that.  I can unequivocally say without any doubt that is what I would do...shredded vagina?  My god the thought is beyond horrifying.
           </p>
           <p>
            That so much personal identifying information about the child was posted on the net by mom is another thing that gave me pause.  Mom doesn't strike me as protective/but again/how would I know the truth?

            I did look at her twitter and yes impressive collection.  The part that has me question/not state this is what I know to be true (please get that) is if she is a narcissistic personality then all that she is doing would fit the agenda.
           </p>
           <p>
            Again, I'm not saying she is narcissistic...but the doubt has been raised.  Thru this whole election, pizzagate and other hot issues of today, coupled with all I've seen of the last decades narcissist do the strangest things to get attention and lies fly out of their mouths and fingers like water.
           </p>
           <p>
            Personally I've known sociopaths, narcissists and briefly crossed paths with a psychopath.  One thing they seem to have in common is an ability to be very convincing, very clever and very good at eliciting sympathy and trust.
           </p>
           <p>
            All of this simply bc I wanted to find out about her daughter...I wasn't looking for this kind of 'more' about her.

            Look, I know what you are saying, really I do.  In this whole mess I've believed in ppl that turned out to be not what they say they are.  Ppl that say they are there for the children but it turns out to be a hidden agenda.  I don't know if she is the real deal and that poor child is being raped and passed around or if she was the one actually harming the child.  How would or could I possibly know the truth?
           </p>
           <p>
            I just believe that when we get on the bandwagon of causes it's a balanced approach to offer all the info we find/not just what we would like to believe.  I would love to believe that every mother loves her child.  I would love to believe that every child advocate is really doing it for altruistic reasons.  Unfortunately that's not how things are playing out so I'm more questioning than I was prior.

            Actually being horrified about her daughter and trying to find out 'more', if the child was safe now, anything, stumbled on information contrary to popular sentiment.

            Can't really say which is true/false...never heard of her before.  But I see enough on search to question the validity of her story.  It would take some in depth digging to see what is true.  I'm not going to dig/just suggesting there might be 'more' to her story.  The audio of her daughter does raise questions but also reading Lori coached her daughter on what to say.  She also has made no effort to connect with her daughter from what I read even tho she has privileges.
           </p>
           <p>
            It's really important imho to gather all the known information before calling out the dogs so to speak.  Present a balanced perspective.

           <p>
            Which really says nothing that validates her/ppl with phd's, UN ties and on TV have been questionable too.

            Don't know if this is considered a valid site...she was discussed on
