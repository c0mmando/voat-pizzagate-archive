            This is an important article on ritual abuse~~it is from Australia but the victim was found credible and it included murder. I know Bill, so he emailed me the content. I believe this can be purchased on Amazon, as it for the Catholic reporter and is premium content.

Australian man accuses priest of ritual abuse
           </p>
           <p>
            By BILL FROGAMENI
           </p>
           <p>
            In 2002, the Melbourne, Australia, archdiocese paid a legal settlement to a man who alleged a priest abused him in satanic rituals. The alleged victim, a 56-year-old Australian who asked to be identified by the pseudonym “James T.,” also claims he witnessed at least three brutal murders that took place during the rituals.
           </p>
           <p>
            The man’s claims became public May 26 when Australian crime reporter Gary Hughes broke the story simultaneously in the country’s largest daily papers, all of which are owned by the News Corp media conglomerate.
           </p>
           <p>
            James T. claims he was abused starting at age 11 in 1961 by Fr. Thomas O’Keefe, a priest of the Melbourne archdiocese. He said the abuse lasted about three years. During that time, he claims O’Keefe and others -- most of whom he says he cannot positively identify -- performed satanic rituals and killed at least three people.
           </p>
           <p>
            James said he decided to contact the media after Fr. Gerald Robinson, an Ohio priest, was convicted May 11 of ritually murdering a Catholic nun. Leading up to the trial, allegations -- still unsubstantiated -- surfaced that Robinson was connected to a larger group of priests who practiced Satanism and murder in cult fashion.
           </p>
           <p>
            According to Msgr. Les Tomlinson, vicar general for the Melbourne archdiocese, O’Keefe died more than 20 years ago.
           </p>
           <p>
            An October 2000 letter written by Peter O’Callaghan, a lawyer and investigator for the Melbourne archdiocese, accepted James T.’s abuse allegations as credible. After meeting James and evaluating his psychiatric treatment history, O’Callaghan wrote James’ lawyer, saying “I am satisfied that [James] was a victim of sexual abuse inter alia [‘among other things’] by Fr. Thomas O’Keefe.” In January 2001, Cardinal George Pell of Sydney -- then Melbourne’s archbishop -- wrote James an apology and offered compensation.
           </p>
           <p>
            Speaking for the archdiocese, Tomlinson said James was ultimately paid 33,000 Australian dollars, but Tomlinson described the allegations in more nuanced terms than does O’Callaghan’s letter. “We have a complainant whom [investigator O’Callaghan] had no reason to disbelieve, but whose allegations cannot be substantiated,” said Tomlinson. Since the story became public, Tomlinson told NCR, he’s been contacted by psychologists who advised him to regard memories of ritual abuse “with great criticism.” Tomlinson added: “As far as I’m aware, there have been no other allegations made against this priest.” Nor, the monsignor said, is he aware of any other ritual abuse claims against Melbourne church employees.
           </p>
           <p>
            The Melbourne archdiocese represents just over 1 million Catholics, said Tomlinson.
           </p>
           <p>
            Although James’ allegations were brought to Australian police in the late 1990s, thus far police haven’t substantiated the crimes.
