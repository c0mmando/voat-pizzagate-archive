<p>Cheryl Mills and sandler worked at the law firm next door to bounce.</p>
<p>maybe this is the 65,000 hot dog white house party we were looking for?</p>
<p><strong>IMPORTANT EDIT: 8ch posters and yourselves have asked how I connected Mayson to all of this. LABONTE</strong></p>

<p><em>I apologize for this fuck up. I was even sitting here staring at my computer screen this morning trying to remember how the fuck I linked it.... need more sleep and more organization</em></p>
<p>Also, I\'ve been asked about the connection to Besta Pizza and Besta World. Right, at this moment I don\'t have irrefutable evidence linking this, but if you consider that Besta World links to this massive amounts of money, drug, child and arms laundering thru the Taylors, which just so happens to pop up the thumbnail for Bounce, which just so happens to be nearly identical to Comet Ping Pong (and Ace for that matter), and just so happens to be next to a law firm that Cheryl Mills used to work at with Sandler, that just so happens to have a place next door to it called Besta Pizza, that just so happens to be owned by a Qatari with pedo symbols in the logo, then I have a bridge to sell.

<p>PS. Mayson\'s director is a russian registered in Moscow. </p>

<p>&quot; A few notable businessmen said to be calling the shots in Shaba are American Maurice Tempelsman, <strong>Zimbabwean Billy Rautenbach</strong>, South African Marc Rich, British John Bredenkamp, Swede Adolph Lundin and Jean Raymond Boulle.</p>
<p>Tenke Mining, owned by Swedish mining magnate Lundin is one of some 15 multinational mining companies partnered with GECAMINES in Shaba. Lundin is called a longtime associate of George HW Bush; African Confidential reported in 1997 that the ex-president telephoned Mobutu on Lundin\'s behalf after the dictator had threatened to terminate a mining contract.</p>
<p>Pardoned by outgoing <strong>President Clinton</strong> for tax-evasion charges, <strong>Marc Rich</strong> operates the Swiss-based Glencore company. &quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Katanga\'s militias and racketeering are connected to <strong>criminal networks of businessmen, including Zimbabwe President Robert Mugabe, Billy Rautenbach</strong>, John Bredenkamp, and <strong>Marc Rich</strong>. U.S. diamond magnate Maurice Tempelsman has profited from Katanga concessions since the Kennedy era. Lawrence Devlin, the old CIA station chief of Lubumbashi under Eisenhower, maintained Tempelsman\'s criminal rackets with direct ties to Zaire\'s former President Mobutu, and was subsequently employed by Tempelsman (16). &quot;</p>',

           Also, I've been asked about the connection to Besta Pizza and Besta World. Right, at this moment I don't have irrefutable evidence linking this, but if you consider that Besta World links to this massive amounts of money, drug, child and arms laundering thru the Taylors, which just so happens to pop up the thumbnail for Bounce, which just so happens to be nearly identical to Comet Ping Pong (and Ace for that matter), and just so happens to be next to a law firm that Cheryl Mills used to work at with Sandler, that just so happens to have a place next door to it called Besta Pizza, that just so happens to be owned by a Qatari with pedo symbols in the logo, then I have a bridge to sell.

            A clear-cut case, today( Dec 21, 2016), of PEOPLE (in this case prostitutes) being used as PAYMENT in big-time financial scams. What if the perpetrator's taste runs to pedophilia? #PizzaGate
We know from FBIanon and other sources that the bad-hats in pizzagate use people as payment in all sorts of illegal exchanges (including political pay-to-play) but there is a lack of direct evidence . This news article is direct evidence. Because of the sheer dollar value in this particular scam (reportedly $2 Billion) it's pretty likely that pulling the string on the players in this story will turn up known players in pizzagate.

His extensive political contacts and monetary contributions often provide him with access and prestige in those markets, as was the case during the presidency of Bill Clinton.[1][14] From 1993 to 1997, Tempelsman visited the White House at least ten times, met privately with Hillary Clinton on two separate occasions, vacationed with the Clintons and the Kennedy family in Martha's Vineyard, and flew to Moscow and back with President Clinton on Air Force One.[1][6]

            In the 1960s Tempelsman hired as his business agent the CIA station chief in Kinshasa, Larry Devlin, who helped put Mobutu in power and afterward served as his personal adviser

Quote:  Tempelsman has three grown children by his wife Lilly Bucholz, a woman who had also fled Antwerp with her family. They were married in 1949.[2] His daughter, Rena, is the widow of Robert Speisman, an executive vice president of Lazare Kaplan International Inc. who died on board American Airlines Flight 77, when the aircraft crashed into The Pentagon during the September 11 attacks.[28]

            Podesta Group may have used Russian Bank for Money Laundering.  Podesta Group and by extension Clintons connected to Russian Bank exposed in Panama Papers. Here is an article with details.

            I find it interesting that Panama Papers stories were buried so quickly.

            <a href="http://www.ici.org">
             http://www.ici.org

            yet?
           </p>
           <p>
            Oh crap, I was going through the Podesta Emails, and I found one that I think was crucial to the money laundering. I should have bookmarked it, because searches aren't pulling it up now. I'm freaking out! I've been searching for it for the last two hours.
           </p>
           <p>
            Anyway, one of the people it was sent to was
            <a class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="74041b1011070015341d171d5a1b0613" href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection">
             [email protected]
            </a>
            and in the email, John Podesta mentions how much money he has in something that is in London, Washington D.C. and another country that I forgot, but it was a lot of money. Possibly in the millions or billions.
           </p>
           <p>
            I already did a search for all emails with "ici.org" and went through all emails, nothing. Then searched for all emails with "London, Washington D.C." and went through all of those, still nothing.
           </p>
           <p>
            I'm so pissed at myself right now.

             I've been searching for too long.
            </p>
            <p>
             I did notice that a search for "ici.org" pulls up 48 results, while a search for "ici" pulls up 49 results.
            </p>
            <p>
             I can't think straight, I've been searching for too long and my eyes hurt.
            </p>
            <p>
             I did notice that all the emails seem like the text is the same format, big and spaced apart, but I'm sure the one that mentions the money, was smaller print and closer together. Is it possible for text to be in another format on the wikileak email pages, and if so, could it effect search results?
            </p>
            <p>
             I know what I saw, and I don't understand why I can't find it. Perhaps I just need sleep.

              There's 542 search results for "London", so it must be in there somewhere.
             </p>
             <p>
              The first thing in the email was a short paragraph that mentions money in digits with the list of countries mentioned after that in the same or following sentence.
             </p>
             <p>
              It was from one person and to a few other people.
I know for a fact it was sent to
              <a class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="89f9e6edecfafde8c9e0eae0a7e6fbee" href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection">

            The guy has apparently deleted his account. Nothing comes up clicking on his link and his comments are missing but still referred to by bouncepingpong in the "Royals" comment.
           </p>

            So yeah he's totally not guilty of anything but guilty enough to delete everything when called out on his creepy shit

           </p>
           <p>
            I feel like I am being paranoid but with all this craziness my mind has been thrown for a loop.
           </p>
           <p>
            Does anyone have a mirror for the "pizza-master.zip" file? I was in the middle of downloading the file, around 150 MB and got an error saying no file existed. "Failed - NoFile" error
           </p>
           <p>

            The director link is very weak, these companies will be director of any or all companies because you need to have a local person involved to have a company on panama. These corporations basically have a website that you can sign up to they don't double check anything and you will have a company with "a director" in 30 seconds. Just because they signed on to the same director means literally nothing in panama.

            Hey Everyone, this is just the beginning. I've been compiling metadata on possible suspects to see what connects, and I think I may have tapped into something very big here. I'll post new topics to share the new information as it becomes available, so everyone can help further the search.

            I have a proposal!! We shut er down, keep investigating archiving collecting and compiling, BUT...
           </p>
           <p>
            Lets dive and shut down and go silent so we fall out of sonar of the elites and everything. Spread this in private messaging.
We can resurface in 2 months or so.

             Notice this weird phenomena in the presentation vid where you have these cartoonish pet traits overlaying children faces? Is this a way of objectifying kids as if they are mere pets to be owned and "played" with?
Somebody should write them to say "we're on to you guys.."

            Still no connection to the Podestas.
           </p>
           <p>
            Why are all raving about it?
Only because a few shady business connections (Panama, Mossac-Fonseca, UK, Moscow) were researched around a money laundering scandal?
           </p>
           <p>
            It's obviously enough to name a big amount of money, research a bit round it, highlight a few names and the people's imagination runs wild and does the rest to get a hype - without any useful information, while many good comments, not hyped with exaggerated and sensationalist headlines, go unnoticed.
This all supported by a mod, who even makes this worthless post sticky.
           </p>
           <p>
            Is this sticky, BECAUSE it contains no useful information?

             Pizza Express was owned by Giustra - possibly. He had a coy called 222 Pizza Express. There's a Pizza Express in London with 222 for an address.  Pizza Express is now connected to the Clinton's other mate, Doug Band and coy Teneo. They are all friends and have connections to convicted pedophile Jeffrey Epstein so Daily Mail UK report. Stick Prince Andrew in there too. He likes Pizza Express too - Jakarta. Separate post on voat about that.

            One of the FBI anon question was where did Cheryl Mills work before? This would appear to be a key piece of info.

Cheryl Mills and sandler worked at the law firm next door to bounce"
Remembering the big picture is not child porn filmed by Jimmycomet but a worldwide problem that could bring armed conflict. Treason, acts of war...and child trafficking.

            Ok, I think I get it. Besta World Group isn't the connection. It could very well be a coincidence. There are some layers of separation, but the Panama Papers have certainly revealed a massive nest of money launderers. For Pizzagate to get validation, you are going to have to tie human trafficking directly to a couple of these people. We already have multiple serial molesters involved.
           </p>
           <p>
            <strong>
             The alleged connection is through Grayson/Alefantis via Bounce Ping Pong, based on the reference in the Instagram picture, plus the proximity of location of Grayson offices and Bounce Ping Pong.
            </strong>
            (Correct my record, if I have that wrong) I wouldn't call THAT a smoking gun, but we do have some others.

             I think the smoking gun for Pizzagate will be found when Frank Giustra get's tied to human trafficking.
            </strong>
            I have reason to believe the Kazakh mining interests owned by Giustra rely on forced labor from trafficked Mongolians. Considering how involved Giustra is in mining, all over the world, and the fact there is a "nexus of gold mining and human trafficking," it seems clear that he is brushing up against trafficking regularly in order to make money. Forced labor is just another cog in the wheel.

            Mossack Fonseca is helping Clinton Associates, like Podesta and Giustra, create shell companies to move money through. Money that is illegal. Whatever the source, the money is illegal because the financial relationships are supposed to be registered with the Attorney General, and, legally, it is treason per code 18 U.S. Code § 2386.

            Financial crimes, aside, accepting money from Saudi Arabia (who funds ISIS and funded 9/11 and who funded Huma's father), to influence policy inside the US (like not being able to sue for 9/11 terror attacks) and abroad (like propping up Morsi in Egypt), the Panama Papers combined with the Wikileaks emails are primary sources/direct evidence of treason.

            Combine that with the ten or more years of reporting on the same issue, over and over, it is incontrovertible evidence of treason based on finances, alone. Obviously, there are facts on the ground that show other types, like involving CIA as FSA imposters or having Blue Mountain hire Al Qaeda sympathizers, but the leaks, alone, are the "smoking gun" in regards to 18 U.S. Code § 2386.

            Podesta's involvement is treason, itself, because he failed to report financial relationships to foreign powers while lobbying in Washington. He wasn't the only one, and Hillary was aware. Misprision is a term for knowing and concealing someone else's treason. 18 U.S. Code § 2382. Kazatomprom's CEO was put in jail. Morsi was put in jail. A variety of others involved with the Clintons have been jailed for cooperating with the aim of personal gain while causing detriment to their own countries.
           </p>
           <p>
            Meaning, many people know this treason is going on and are actively working to conceal it.

           <p>
            Arming ISIS, ignoring 9/11, giving uranium to the Russians, in order for Putin to gain leverage in the energy markets, shows that Hillary is a free agent who sells treason for money.

            Personally, I wonder if Soros and Putin are working together or if if Hillary is dealing with opposing powers simultaneously.

              <p>
               (Putin vs Soros)
in my opinion; at the time, he either did not know or he did not care that Hillary was dealing with Soros. however, the fact that he genuinely feared WW3 if Hillary came to power. it points to that Soros and Hillary planed to destabilize Russia with military might and sanctions thru proxy (EU).
              </p>
              <p>
               as it was explained to me; the reason Putin hates Soros is because he tried to create lots of activist groups by funneling money to them to start shit (sound familiar?) and Putin would not have it. any company taking Soros money in Russia is immediately sized by the government. Soros is basically band from Russia and that's why they hate each other.

            There are two in London and another in Chicago. The one I walk past is just a hot spot for trashy people from Essex and businessmen in the area. I've always had always bad vibe from the place but from all my research there is very little evidence it's part of the ring.

            A older video (links below text) on Youtube of tunnels nearby Comet where you see old restaurants. They were all similarly fronted, white paint, red block lettering. One dilapidated storefront had only "izz" remaining in its name. It would have gone unoticed to me but for what this place originally was via a more complete historical pic given in another video. The place was called "Pizza Express."  The newer video of the construction workers seems to confirm that there was for sure a PIzza Express there nearby in the tunnels to Comet. 
What really freaked me out was the video of kids describing abuse (perhaps debunked?) and using the name "Pizza Express" to describe a storefront where this activity occurs. If someone can dig, might help connect some dots. Sorry if my thoughts are a little disorganized. Thanks.

            I mean, they had him, but nope, no one did anything, and big players came to his rescue. This is what we're up against. People can bitch and moan all they want, but I mean, we could lead these "leaders" to a graveyard, and they'd thank us, then hold an art expo on that spot. We just have to hope things are going to change a bit and keep pushing on all fronts, especially with transparency in all of this. It's worse than I even realized with the Panama Papers release. These zombie directors are total patsies who don't make any money in the deal and probably fear for their lives. So much tragedy in all of this - epic human progress fail.

            I know right? They have  map over the DC area with a f'ing golden triangle over it. I have to get some time and compare it to the whole pentagram area from other conspiracy stuff, but man, it's like this shit is crazy. I'll try to post when I find it.
           </p>
           <p>
            Edit: found it
            <a href="https://io9.gizmodo.com/5847682/are-the-streets-of-washington-dc-supposed-to-form-a-pentagram">
             http://io9.gizmodo.com/5847682/are-the-streets-of-washington-dc-supposed-to-form-a-pentagram
            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            So, what's interesting here too is the first line of this article:
           </p>
           <p>
            "Popular lore suggests that the street layout of Washington, D.C., was designed so that the streets emanating from the White House would intersect with landmarks in the area to form a pentagram."
           </p>
           <p>
            And the golden triangle landing page says
           </p>
           <p>
            "The Golden Triangle is the heart of DC’s business district, stretching from the front yard of the White House to Dupont Circle."
           </p>
           <p>
            Both start at the White House. It's pretty funny.

            I just found yet another Ping Pong for adults/night club franchise that links to an elite social network that has so many famous people attached to it, I can even possibly get into posting any of it online since there's no way any of us want that blow back right now. But the pattern of shell companies running through Delaware like I outlined that I can link to the Panama Papers directly that links to so many things, I'm just not going there online. I'm definitely going to recommend we tread lightly with hunting down every thing that looks like the above because I don't want to insinuate that they're all pedophile networks. But this thing is complete "millionaires only" club connected with huge names, and I don't even know where to begin breaking it all down. But highly concerned now that our government was involved with making sure certain entities didn't show up in the papers when the leak happened because this one Delaware entity alone is the agent of a lot of stuff, another trend I keep seeing in the data. So we should probably tread lightly with pointing to this and that franchise and just push for transparency with all of this. It's clear the state of Delaware is a great place to set things up as a go-between.

            Is this related to Pelosi's GOAT PIZZA in the San Francisco area?    Some Panamanian pizza place that donated to Dems.   Money laundering possibly.

            i wanted to point out a strange coincidence. i was watching that horrible video of Alfentis in drag MC-ing some "behind closed doors" type of gathering of all of his cretin type friends. i'm new here so i don't know if you've posted it here, but if you haven't watched it, by all means, watch it and be prepared to be creeped out - i couldn't even finish watching it. someone in the crowd yells out "yeah, little BOYS!" &amp; Alfentis says "well, we all have our preferences!" and then cackles maniaclly. i mean it's just sick. anyway, at one part of the video he makes a very big deal when introducing this one young woman as being important for some damn reason i couldn't hear, but then he really makes a point of saying that SHE'S RUSSIAN!! i mean he says it several times. the chick just seems weird and out of place there, but my instincts told me that she is in some way instrumental with like getting kids from Russia??! i don't know that part of it just flashed thru my mind as this was going on.  So to the OP, i just thought that this was an interesting coincidence, and sorry i don't have a link, but i just came across the video thru normal google searches so you shouldn't have any trouble finding it if you haven't seen it yet. Be prepared to puke tho. Thanks for this post!

             The party with that Sasha lord person with the red face and pink hair - red face has symbolism in satanism by the way - anyway, the he pretendhbg to be a she talks about an abortion and his birth is so gross and then he goes on to say he had to kill it and then says EUTHENASIA a few times with a slow pronunciation so that you realize he's saying YOUTH IN ASIA

              i wouldn't be at all surprised... isn't this sasha lord drag bitch actually alefantis himself? i thought it was VERY odd that he made such a point of calling out this chick as being from Russia. Don't get me wrong, i got nothing against Russia, I think this is a world wide problem. it's just a weird coincidence. (or NOT)

           </p>
           <p>
            You've all displayed good investigative skills and I just realized something.  The original Podesta -email triggering this was from Susan Sandler who said "the REALTOR found a handkerchief (I think it has a map that seems pizza related. Is it yours?..."
           </p>
           <p>
            REALTOR tells me vacant home for sale being used by the creeps for their pizza parties/Satan worship, whatever.
            <em>
             A realtor representing Sandler hence her getting the handkerchief.
            </em>
            Might be worth seeing what properties Sandlers own in the area and any sold around or listed September 2, 2014, the date of the e-mail.

             <p>
              Could it be a map showing them where pizza-related activities are in the area.?

             </p>
             <p>
              ^^^ From that link, this seems rather interesting.  Doesn't explain handkerchief, but what if they were actually talking about a real map to "pizza-related" activities... ie, this is where the party is.
             </p>
             <p>
              I recall way back when raves were popular, there were all kinds of ways people hid the location of the rave on the cards they handed out at clubs.  It had a map, but unless you knew the code, or got the missing info after paying for a ticket, you wouldn't know where the map was taking you.
             </p>
             <p>
              Perhaps his response "it's not important" means nobody could ever determine a location with that.

            If you are on FB, they disabled me, get in contact with the CPS parent groups.  You will find a TON of families fighting against Child Protective Services and corrupt family courts.  Million Parent March has a bunch and Estranged Parents.  Also, Families Forward Project.  Also, check out medicalkidnap.com.  You will start to see how PizzaGate is tied into the Foster Care Industry.  Bill Clinton signed an act in '97 called the Adoption and Safe Families Act that legalized FORCED adoptions.

            It's a maze of nonsense going through all these bogus agent linked operations. It's absurd. Understand I'm experienced in AML, so I know how it actually works, and Delaware has some major explaining to do with all of this. Of course, it's so transparent, it's clear they already know which is the whole reason for this public investigation to begin with. And don't forget, I've already linked this address through the Panama Papers. Too much to even get into here, but one of my favorite companies is "EEETRADE GLOBAL MARKET LTD." ROFL You've got to be kidding meee

            I quit going over to eddit once they shut down pizzagate, and some said the donald was compromised as well.  I'm not sure, but wouldn't put a lot of stock in anything over there anymore.

            Jerome Corsi has a lot of knowledge about the Clintons, the Foundation, and their money-laundering / trafficking activities (including Haiti)
           </p>
           <p>
            Here's Corsi's contact info, send him anything and everything you find that in any way ties this to Clinton and/or the Foundation.

             I agree, he knows that inside out.  His book Partners in Crime covers the CF.  A lot of his material he got from the financial analysis done by Charles Ortel.  Tons of info, and some corporation/names at Charles Ortel.com.

               You're welcome!  Him and Peter Schweitzer (author of Clinton Cash) are both excellent!   In fact, there is a 2-hour radio interview Ortel did on Coast to Coast AM, that is excellent.  I believe it is out on the internet, Google searching for C2C with him as a guest.  Not on the C2C site itself; from there you have to be a paid member to hear it.  But I know I've seen it online.

            I'll also add that I've worked in an industry for years that trains us annually to Know Your Client, specifically for AML and to help prevent illegal activity. Besta Pizza, which ties to this Uptown Pizza, would fail this measure hands down. Sealight and the rest here are in clear violation of that. Not to mention, the burden of proof shouldn't be on us at this point. Explain to me why a lawyer, who is working as the legal counsel for all the restaurants in DC now, is running Besta out of a shell company that had its status revoked. And then explain to me why that same person who got caught moving money around in his personal trust account to other nondescript companies and who the Bar Association in DC wanted to penalize for it had powerful friends come in and fight for him and is still operating? The burden of proof isn't on us, it's on them at this point.

            I checked it out on Google Maps, and it's one of those old style buildings that has a few offices there now. I searched those names and at least one should have some presence on the internet, but none do. It's sketchy. But then I found the address in the Panama Papers and it lead to one company called Oak Holdings LLC, so maybe these people here are just better at covering their tracks. It's all a huge scheme that ran through this address though, no doubt:

           </p>
           <p>
            I don't think they are there anymore, but there is another one in Deleware that popped up:
           </p>

           </p>
           <p>
            I also know people are covering their tracks somehow though because just take the Uptown Pizza (you can look that up on this site too). The account is revoked status, yet Besta Pizza is still in business, so what's up with that? Not to mention the governor listed on it that links nowhere:
            <a href="https://opencorporates.com/companies/us_dc/EXTUID_2684358">
             https://opencorporates.com/companies/us_dc/EXTUID_2684358
            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            The point is, anyone giving anyone grief should think twice. This is the behavior of people covering their tracks, and that means it's illegal shit going on, pick your poison.
           </p>
           <p>
            Oh, and I left out the sketchy Hiz Inc that appeared listed on the internet at the same location with another random name:
           </p>
           <p>
            <a href="http://www.manta.com/c/mb592ws/hiz-inc">
             http://www.manta.com/c/mb592ws/hiz-inc
            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            Do a search on HIZ Inc and DC, and you'll see multiple instances with different contacts coming up.

            I really don't see where there is a smoking gun at all.
As it's name indicates, Sealight
            <strong>
             Incorporations
            </strong>
            Limited is an agent that offers incorporation services of shell companies with a local nominee as director. Obviously if you look for everything that is related to the agent company, the director of the agent company, the share holders of the agent company and other directorships of the placeholder nominees etc, you are going to find thousands of companies that are involved in all sorts of suspicious activities. Just look at the Offshore Leaks
            <a href="https://offshoreleaks.icij.org/nodes/298293">
             page of Sealight Incorporations Limited
            </a>
            : Sealight is connected to 3896 entities! Following those secondary links make no sense. They are just random other clients of Sealight so at most you would be able to establish that two companies are client of the same offshore incorporation company. That's a pretty weak link.
           </p>
           <p>
            AFAICT the link you make between Sealight and Develcan is completely phony. The only relation between Sealight and Develcan is that Sealight incorporated another client company that's called "Everygood International", and both Everygood and Develcan have the same director, an entity called "Standard Directors" that, if its name is any indication, seems like yet another service company specialized in providing placeholder nominees to serve as local directors.
           </p>
           <p>
            I may be missing something, but if that's the case it's something you haven't developed at all in your thread. With the information you have given, all I can see you doing in the thread is making unjustified leaps between loosely related companies and googling the names you find on the way, and it seems like a lucky coincidence that this ended up leading you to another ping pong cafe.
           </p>
           <p>
            If there is more to it than meets the eye, can you clarify your exact reasoning as of how you move from one step to the next and why we should think that Bounce Ping Pong and Besta World Group are related at all?
And if they are, how does that connect us to Besta Pizza?
And even if that connects us to Besta Pizza, what's the connection with Comet Ping Pong other than the fact they are on the same block and are both apparently involved in child trafficking?

             No, you can find my research on Sealight above. I found one link on our own corp lookup that ran sixteen shell or bogus entities through it. However, none of those listed in the Panama Papers, But crazy enough, the address did to another company at the same damn address, and the agent for that was yet another shell company. You think this is easy? It's not easy. And why in the world would anyone create such a mess? Money laundering to say the least, and if that is going on, it can't lead to good things around it.

              Hundreds or even thousands of companies sharing the same registration address is extremely common. In the case of offshore companies, it's even the norm since company registration address defaults to the address of the corporate services company that did the incorporation, provides the nominee director and secretary, manages the AGM, forward the eventual mail and files all the paperwork.
             </p>

               article
              </a>
              you linked to higher up in the thread explains it very well

             <blockquote>
              <p>
               In her passport, Nesita Manceau lists her occupation as "housewife." But she does oh-so-much more. On paper at least, she's a corporate titan. And she's been tangled in an arms-running scandal involving North Korea and Iran.
Manceau is what could be called a "zombie director" of shell companies. She's been on the boards of scores of them. Lawyers in Florida, Oregon and Nevada have clients who call on her services.
The 55-year-old Filipina, who until recently was living in the South Pacific island nation of Vanuatu, exercises what is required of an offshore corporate director: She simply signs her name. Time and time again.
Practically the sole function of an offshore corporate director is to cloak the identity of the real owner of a company or trust. The director serves as a legal shield, of sorts.
The documents known as the Panama Papers teem with these zombie directors who sign corporate papers at the bidding of unidentified owners. Such directors can oversee, at least on paper, hundreds - and sometimes thousands - of corporations.
              </p>
              <p>
               They are a crucial cog in the machinery of foreign law firms and registration agents who churn out phantom corporations, stock them with proxy directors, slap a soothing name on them, and register them on atolls or far-away nations. It is a volume business.
True owners of the shell companies often want passive directors with no control over, or even knowledge of, actual operations. Secretaries, Burger King cooks and housewives will do.
Corporate registration agents like Mossack Fonseca, the Panama law firm whose 11.5 million leaked documents comprise the Panama Papers archive, earn extra fees when they stock the boards of offshore entities with nominees who usually have no clue as to the identity of the true owners.
              </p>
             </blockquote>
             <p>
              It's entirely pointless to try to connect offshore companies through their intermediaries. Offshore companies are
              <strong>
               designed to obfuscate the legal owner of the entity and shield her from all legal responsibilities

The only salient information is shareholders if its a private company: this information is available publicly in a central company registry in some jurisdictions like Singapore and Hong Kong. If it's a trust you are out of luck as beneficiaries are not public information. Now, Panama Papers are a leak and I'm sure a lot more confidential information is laying around waiting to be discovered, but you won't find that in the semantic graph.

               It's not "perfectly common." Sorry dude, I don't know what you think you know, but you are generalizing things that you haven't studied. Even at a tower in NYC, it's easy to trace the owners to individuals in a legal business. I should know since I've worked in many. A run down office building in the middle of nowhere creating businesses that do everything from oil to herbs to beauty supplies with some really sketchy naming all linking directly back to an agent in Hong Kong would bring the law down in force if the law was respected. But the point is, the law isn't being respected when these companies are set up, and clearly the state of Delaware is complicit in all of this. Which to your point though, you got that perfectly - there is no transparency at the transaction level to the public as far as money movement, but that is what companies I worked for do - it's called anti-money laundering. And it would seem our government has broken the law here.

                Virtually every office space, virtual office and corporate service company offers registered address services hosted at their own business address, and it's a staple in offshore jurisdictions. You don't seem to have much experience of business. I can't force you to believe me, so feel free to keep trying to connect the dots using intermediaries, officers and registered addresses. You'll quickly notice that you are going round in circles. But don't take my word. Try it for yourself. You can't know it until you experience it.

                You don't seem to understand how offshore companies are working. It's precisely because "phantom" shell companies are legal in the jurisdiction where they are incorporated that they are being used and that many incorporation services companies have developed to help fast tracking the process of creating an offshore entity.

                Either way there is no transparency at transaction level to the public. It's not like SWIFT, SEPA, ACH &amp; co transactions where public domain. Depending on the local regulation, it is legal or illegal to transact with offshore corporations of specific jurisdictions due to their being essentially anonymous, but that can be easily worked around by bouncing through more lenient financial hubs like Hong Kong, the Luxembourg or the United Arab Emirates. There are also plenty of reckless banks like HSBC and Goldman Sachs who will not ask too many questions.

                 Again, I'm trained in AML, and this is clearly money laundering activity. I've linked hundreds of thousands of companies in my lifetime, and I know what to look for. I'm curious why you're so upset by all of this? Do you not care about money laundering to foreign interests?

                 You're right though that there's no reason to belabor this convo. Just go down and set up an eTrading account with EEETRADE GLOBAL MARKET LTD.

                 or show me where I can or show an advertisement for this company. Seriously. It's that simple. If I'm off base, and this ridiculously "like-sounding" name to an electronic trading entity is legit, I'll stop looking at all of it if you can. You won't be able to though because this is clearly a made up name operating at a nondescript location in Delaware that houses a few small companies, usually a couple of law offices. It's not even designed to house sixteen companies.

                  Have you seen any financial transactions emanating from Besta World Group? For all we know, it's entirely possible that the entity is dormant and not involved in any money flow, or not doing anything that transits through the US in which case the way they are using their shell company could be perfectly legal from a regulatory perspective. EIther way, we just don't have access to the transactions records, that's not the kind of thing you will find in the Panama Papers. So the question of whether Besta Pizza / Andrew Kline are doing money laundering is moot because we won't find it that way anyway. And no having an offshore entity is not in itself a crime, so finding a connection between Besta Pizza and Besta World Group won't even be actionable.

                  I'm not upset. I'm concerned that we are barking up the wrong tree and wasting time and resources on following random and very tenuous leads that aren't even relevant to what we are trying to investigate here. It's like if you were trying to find other guilty parties by looking at people on the street and finding the ones who wear the same clothes. Maybe you can find something with a lot of luck. But that's hardly a "smoking gun" like OP claims it to be. At best using intermediaries and officers, you'll get very tenuous and far fetched connections. Shareholders is a different story: that's a much sounder connection albeit much more difficult to make.

                  Separation of concerns. I don't think that an investigation around a child trafficking ring is the right place to start tracking possible compliance breaches. That's the job of the FSA, the SEC or the IRS and if you are concerned that they may not be doing their job for the same reason that NYPD, the FBI and the DOJ aren't doing their job either, you can start another sub dedicated to auditing fniancially the Whitehouse and their crony  businesses (good luck getting the data).

                  This thread has received 600+ upvotes and hundred of comments and is currently hogging the only sticky slot that we have in spite of the fact it hasn't led to anything relevant (I'm still waiting for an explanation of what is supposed to be relevant in the finding: why is Bounce Ping Pong of interest other than the fact it has Ping Pong tables?). Because of that, it's getting much more attention than it deserves, and detracting from more productive investigation efforts. Every hour that people will spend trying to connect entities that are designed to obfuscate relationships and making phony connections based on very loose legal relationships that they may not entirely comprehend is one hour that isn't spent finding better leads.

                 <p>
                  Again I'm not saying that there is nothing to find in the Offshore Leaks. Bringing this was a good idea and with a rational analysis that looks at the right criteria like share ownership or directors / registration address that aren't also involved in the incorporation of another few hundreds of entities, there is probably some cues that we can try to find. But walking at random on the graph using ultra common intermediaries as connection doesn't belong to the list of strategies that will work. Only people who really understand the nature of the connections they are following should spend time analyzing this dataset. And it should be clear that this dataset isn't exactly the gold mine that it seems to be when following random connections and googling random shady organizations.

                  You can call me a concern troll, but time isn't our ally. The longer this investigation takes to come up with hard evidence and the more false leads we create and boast about, the scarcer the public attention will be when we finally find a real smoking gun, and the lower our chance of building enough momentum to force the FBI to open an official investigation. Meanwhile, children are being abused.

                   You keep putting the cart in front of the horse, and you're spending a lot of energy doing so. There is already enough evidence for an investigation into all of this, and that has nothing to do with the actual fears of pedophilia. Let me help you focus. The concern is that our government is breaking the law. We have already proven that they are breaking the law. My examples in Delaware show they are breaking the law. This requires a full investigation into the agents that they certified that enable all of this to begin with.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   Anti-Money Laundering is all about knowing your client. On the surface, there is already evidence that they do not know their client, yet they approve these agents to then approve these companies. Banks, offshore accounts, all of that is the cart, not the horse. If you want a company, you got to a state and you need an agent. You are supposed to be verified. The agent is supposed to be verified. All of our secondary services rely on the government doing this - banks cannot arrest people (I can explain the entire process if you need it explained).
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   There is also historical evidence that the owner of Besta Pizza was under scrutiny with the DC Bar who wanted to know why he was moving money through a Trust account in what seemed like a bribe. Powerful people came and plead his case. No one understood it at the time. He was cleared. He's still the listed owner. He represents all of the restaurant businesses in Washington DC. Again, we are not the police - we are surfacing more and more evidence to put pressure on law enforcement to do their jobs, period. I can show you another recent case where this same Besta Pizza agent of Uptown Pizza (is it even uptown?) created a scene this year when officials were pushing back on bar licensing in Washington DC. You continuously say "only people who understand it" which proves you're siding with authority which is obviously turning the other way.If that authority is corrupt, why in the hell would we turn it over to them to begin with? So yeah, you're trying to deter people from surfacing evidence, so have fun with that, you're not for the cause of justice clearly if you want corruption to continue unabated.

                    This shows beyond doubt that you are in the wrong sub. What we want is specifically to take down the pedophile ring, which implies that the Whitehouse and crony businesses should be investigated on that specific charge. You won't even get the same type of agency investigating white colar crime and child trafficing.

                   <p>
                    No that's not at all the concern. The elite is and has always considered itself above the the law and has always been breaking it routinely in a quasi systematic manner. That's nothing new. In case you are not aware, the Pentagon has managed to "lose" (read "embezzle")
                    <a href="http://edition.cnn.com/2016/08/23/politics/us-army-audit-accounting-errors/">
                     USD 6.5 trillions
                    </a>
                    (not a misspelling) and this didn't even create much public outrage. Anyway, that's the second time in a couple of years that they lose trillions, and the government has the Fed print gazillions every year so who cares. Money is just toilet paper and everyone expects that politicians will be lining their pockets and squander the rest on useless wars that were not even approved by the congress. People couldn't be more jaded about public money matters nowadays. So if you think we are here working around the clock to catch a pizzeria and the Clinton Foundation red handed laundering 6-figure sums, you are seriously mistaken about the purpose of this whole enterprise.
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    Now my turn to help you focus: as we are speaking, there are children that are being routinely raped, psychologically and physically abused, sequestered in dark and cold basements, and eventually murdered when they are not sacrificed in a gruesome satanic ritual, and that is what everyone on this sub (except apparently you) is really concerned about. And that is what we are going to push the FBI to investigate and prosecute. And hopefully that will happen early enough to save as many lives as possible.
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    Now feeI free to investigate your stuff on your side as you see fit, but don't expect that the rest of the sub will be interested in getting the Whitehouse investigated on charges of money laundering.

             Okay. Even if they aren't directly correlated, do you honestly think its a coincidence that develcan links all of the things below that together?

              What are all the things below? An (apparently unrelated) restaurant in UK, a bunch of random shell companies that have no relation whatoever, a couple of international fraudsters that have no relation either, and Besta World Group? Sorry but no, I don't think it's a troubling coincidence. Take another research path and you'll find another dozen of interesting, suspicious, yet completely unrelated shell companies.
             </p>
             <p>
              Maybe I'm missing something. If you think that's the case, please explain how the leaps through very tenuous relationships has got us any closer of the Clinton Foundation, Comet Ping Pong, the Podestas or even Besta Pizza.

             Now I know why FBI Anon said the evidence would take down most of the worlds governments and more than half of america's
            </p>
            <p>
             But I couldn't care less.  Burn it all down!  I can't stand thinking about these children and no one doing anything about it, and seeing Allepo and Damascus what was once a beautiful bountiful place going to ruins with children being sold and killed there now and isis all over the place - all of these atrocities started by our government - Mostly Hillary when it comes to Syria.  It just sickens me.
            </p>
            <p>
             Like you though, it's impossible to keep track.  This is a web in a web in a web that goes on almost infinitely.  It makes me wonder how the evil doers themselves keep track of who's who and who owes who and who killed who and so forth.  It's way way way worse than Scandal the tv show.  I thought it was hard keeping up with that, well this is a whole nother level.

            Hi there.
           </p>
           <p>
            OP here.
           </p>
           <p>
            Essentially my "link" of Besta to Besta is when you google mayson, and hit the images tab, a THUMNAIL of a map for Bounce Ping Pong comes up.
           </p>
           <p>
            For there to be a ping pong place nearly identical to Comet Ping Pong, which just so happens to be next door to pedo logo besta pizza, seemed like too much of a coincidence.
           </p>
           <p>
            It might not be a direct like (yet, I have more digging to do and no time this week), but to me thats too much of a coincidence in what is already an impossible set of coincidences as a whole.

             Maybe edit and put "Potential" in front of smoking gun to stop ppl from complaining bout it (if possible). You got the attention that this needed and deserved by putting smoking gun on it. I'm not familiar with this site enough to know whether there was anther way to bring light to it so fast.

            The whole 'ping pong' thing suddenly makes a whole lot of sense as the network is all about ensuring that there are no direct links between transactions. That's why they think that they are untouchable.  Anyone remember this Superbowl ping pong ad from 2 years ago ?

             Swartzennegar (sp?) calls him "little princess" and in the end the game is called "sudden death ping pong".

            not to add confusion - the money laundering is as big as it is, because they are awash in it. I just watched another video outlining the function of the U.S. Federal Reserve (and by extension ((same operating model)) every other Central Bank) and this is the top-down source of
            <em>
             unimaginable
            </em>
            amounts of liquidity.
           </p>
           <p>
            The board members are the top of the same food chain all these "little" players belong to. Find them, ferret out their connections and it will start to become much more of a structured view of a global club. The Clinton Foundation (and many others like it) are simply the hubs for all the dirty business. (Soros has created 187 foundations... let that sink in...)
           </p>
           <p>
            Board members of the Federal Reserve (don't forget, it's a privately held corporation) are, without a doubt, involved in the same putrid pleasures as the local D.C. group, but they are
            <em>
             much
            </em>
            bigger fish. Taking them down will cascade everything they're connected to.

            Sorry I don't see the connection btw Besta Pizza and Besta World Group. There's some kind of smoke here but it needs a better tie-in.

            I really am not understanding but I am trying to link Besta Pizza to Besta world group inc.
           </p>
           <p>
            So I looked for companies with the name BESTA in NY (same city as the uptown pizza inc) and found this company
            <a href="https://www.company-detail.com/company-american-besta-international-group-inc-3290208">
             https://www.company-detail.com/company-american-besta-international-group-inc-3290208
            </a>
            . Now the owner is ZHENNAN LIAN and he also owns Besta (Uk) Limited
            <a href="http://directors.findthecompany.co.uk/l/4671710/Zhennan-Lian">
             http://directors.findthecompany.co.uk/l/4671710/Zhennan-Lian
            </a>
            .
           </p>
           <p>
            Going from your Besta World Group Inc panamadb site. The following companies are also held at that address in HK:

               No, it isn't. This has been debunked repeatedly....even within this thread.  Two, different Andrew Klines.  Also See other pizzagate thread Proof That DOJ Andrew Kline is different from real estate atty, restaurant agent.

            I always thought the Panama Papers were suspiciously lacking US data. While searching on Sealight Incorporation Limited, I found this database that showed it as an agent for 16 companies in Delaware all at the same address. The names are pretty lame too. I always felt the Panama Papers were a bit US light, and seems the data may have been scrubbed of it before release.

             Okay, so the Oak Holdings LLC from Panama Papers that links to Sealight through our corp lookup leads to the UK directly (same address) which is in the Panama Papers. The UK site that they're rolling out is pretty sweet, has the actual filings in PDF. So Oak Holdings LLC was set up by M.C. FAMILY OFFICE LIMITED which has the original filing listing two people living in the UK and the Delaware address. Our own corp lookup tool shows Oak Holdings LLC originating in the UK, but with the Delaware address listed.

              King Kong, maybe a note in the OP if you want us to 'share' these breaking news things, or keep the info here, until enough evidence/documentation is made?  I just don't want to tip them off if we can help it, and also don't want anyone confronting them without all necessary precautions taken.

             Yes, the alleged connection is based on the baby/money picture and the proximity of Bounce Ping Pong and Grayson.

             Even if Bestas were connected, the degrees of separation make it tenuous.

             I was surprised at how truly dismissive the NYT article was, and how it claimed they had debunked the whole thing after simply
             <em>
              asking the people implicated about how they were handling it.
             </em>
             No questions about or even independent research into any of the many coincidences and connections dragged into the light.
            </p>
            <p>
             I know I shouldn't be expecting more from such a biased/elite-entrenched corporate media,  but at the end of the day, I still want some of the reporters and editors there to go rogue and redpill America. I have lost all faith in the corporate media, but not (totally) in journalists.

            Quite a bit. It is a pain to sift through. Basically, it implicates anyone you can think of who is super rich, but tying a shell company to financial transactions is difficult, let alone specific illegal ctivity. But, the easiest way is to start searching up names, then the addresses of anything you think is suspicious.
           </p>
           <p>
            As in the Podesta connection to the Uranium One scandal. It is a smoking gun for treason and Hillary Clinton, and even though the New York Times did a good story on it, the public didn't react. And people shout SMOKING GUN so much that it has lost meaning.
           </p>
           <p>
            But, as far as treason, the Panama Papers are the smoking gun.

            Comet Ping Pong has a Tumblr. On one page the tumblr posts a picture of Ping pong tables and text reading, "Favorite PingPong Palace in Berlin, Dr. Pong". I found their website and unfortunantely it's in German. But it didn't take me long to find a cartoon baby, kid and a hotdog. The last page is full of unusual links. I don't know how to research as good as you guys can so please carry the torch, here's the website:

              On their page . At the very bottom on the right you'll see the word "code" click it . Takes you to a very weird website . It's a picture of a toilet with weird text. I have a feeling that info is hidden within the picture. I'm not savy enough to check......someone should..

            Hey everyone,
           </p>
           <p>
            You need to do something about this stuff now.  So what about Larry Klayman?
           </p>

            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            I don't know any attorneys personally, although I used to work for court reporters in various states.  What about Klayman? He stands up for conservative, but does anyone know if he is trustworthy?

            This is a dead end until you can connect Besta Pizza to Besta World Group. Besta Pizza website says they have been around since 94 (although maybe they changed names at some stage?). Besta World Group says registered in 2003. Can anyone connect the 2?

            This looks really fake. We have to be wary about latching onto things that may not be real, it could ruin our credibility.

            You should really be archiving ALL those pages dude. Also, as I have said for a while, this whole thing is likely more about: money laundering, arms trades, people trafficking, and a little bit of pedo shit thrown in. I don't know why everyone is tunnel visioned on a pedo ring as the end game, when the evidence continues to point to selling kids, drugs, arms, and hiding money. The pedo stuff is just the cherry on top for some bored billionaires (don't kid yourself, with their hidden assets they are all billionaires).  I AM NOT SAYING THERE IS NO PEDO STUFF, it's pretty clear there is (and proof from old arrests etc), but I think people will have better luck connecting it all if they do as the anon above did and follow the money! Here's my personal and made up slice of the pie:
            <br/>
            40% money laundering/payoffs
            <br/>
            20% arms/drugs trade
            <br/>
            20% human trafficking
            <br/>
            10% pedo parties
            <br/>
            10% connecting businesses with similar interests so that it's easy to keep track but hard to trace

             I think people are focused on the pedo stuff because its ultimately the worst of it all to us. I have to be honest, I'd not be happy to hear about arms, drugs, money laundering, and political payoffs but we're all so used it being a "common" thing to occur (gee wonder if all the movies normalized it for us... and now we're hearing about pedos being a mental illness and not a crime...). We all know pedo occurs but it's never been in the lime light and we want to protect the innocent. I wouldn't be involved in this without the pedo side of it. I am furious about it. But you're absolutely right, it's bigger than that.

              Yes. And it goes back many decades, right back to black &amp; white motion pictures. Romanticizing criminals. Why? Jewish mafia / Hollywood, same deal.

              I believe the pedo is used as blackmail. Compromise those involved in government and the justice system to gain greater power.

               Exactly. That is Jeffrey Epstein role and others like him. Invite people, get them into compromised position (possibly by drugging), film them doing heinous things...then blackmail . The ones who like it come back for more...those who don't, stay silent.
That is how the Clintons got there in the first place...only they didn't need drugging.
Podesta is not a glorified secretary. Podesta is a real power.

               THIS. Blackmail like this works only within a society willing to turn on dissenters of decency (which is one of the reasons I'm always more suspicious of the holier-than-thous). But make no mistake; the pedo industry is a $32B business. The drug and weapons trades are a serious business, but the pedo and trafficking business is bigger. Most survivors I've come across suggest it's all always interconnected.

              Wikileaks is VERY suspect right now. VERY. They REFUSE to show Assange proof of life for a month at this point. And we get VERY weird excuses. Then they change their codes. They can't be trusted right now. Assange may be making a deal. Their "proof" is that the cats twitter had updates... But no photos or videos of Assange. He is most likely alive, but probably not at the embassy, that's why the stall.

               If there are any very solid connections to be made based on the wikileaks evidence, why not put them on the research site? It could be in both places, here and there, and since wikileaks is known as credible, it could add structure and credibility to the investigation. Regardless of what has happened to Assange. Unless I'm missing something important.

                This is not how it works. You bring up a smoking gun and let it viral out, you don't play PR and tone-policing. The latter backfires heavily, allowing disrupters to take control and neutralize the popular investigation and interest.
               </p>
               <p>
                What you're suggesting is old media: "credibility" and deception work. If you wanna play fakery, you're on the wrong team. Even "looking good by using the credible channels" is part of fakery. Let them run the stories as they wish, they are powerless in front of the network-based tidal wave of content. As soon as you rely upon them for content-polishing and -publishing, they own you and you are working for the pedos.

                Because of the complete tonal shift and weird behavior, that coincided with internet outages, armed guards, and a missing Assange; a lot of people think it is now a CIA or similar (to another country) run operation. And the fact they keep refusing to show him or show proof it hasn't been taken, lends even more suspicion. Probably don't want to load all the things you are looking into directly into the CIA's hands. At least make them work for it. This is just the general opinion of those in the world.

               Exactly my thoughts. There's too much concern trolling of late here or I would have started a complete thread on it all. It's pretty jaw dropping. I'm not sure what the concern trolls think will happen if we "organize." Like, oh right, people that are taking over the world and killing whoever they want or gets in their way are going to be like, "Gee, now that you presented your arguments this way, we admit it all! And we would have gotten away with it if it wasn't for you crazy kids and your memes." But I'm running with it on my own, will reach out to some people who do the whole analysis with the pyramids and the like - I'm sure they'll love this.

            Priscila Lustre is Director at a number of companies all registered at the same address in London, and also registered at that address is a company called EPF trading Ltd, which is a shareholder of Central European Securities Ltd, registered in the British Virgin Islands, and Mossack Fonseca &amp; Co is an intermediary. Also a Ukrainian person is the beneficiary of CESC Ltd, Mykhaylo Khalanych. Director of EPF is Ian Taylor - Priscila and Geoffrey's son.

            The London address is just down the street from 788 Finchley road, an address that an investigator in the UK looked into and apparently has 200,000 companies registered there - this guy (Gordon Bowden) discovered huge amounts of fraud and money laundering and things like British politicians stealing nuclear weapons from South africa etc. It seems like there is SO MUCH going on it's insane.

            Bounce Ping Pong, the London ping pong bar/pizza restaurant, opened another ping pong bar/pizza restaurant in Chicago, called Ace Bounce. Now, normally I would dismiss this weird stuff as confirmation bias, but the rabbit hole that is pizzagate really has me thinking about some stuff on their Instagram and website.
           </p>
           <p>
            This stuff might be worth something, but it also might be just speculation on my part.
           </p>
           <p>
            Advertisement for booking holiday parties, featuring statue of a kid holding a ping pong paddle in a weird pose:

            Republican/Democrat/Pizza party photo, similar to the one on Alefantis' Instagram but without the ninja turtles:

             https://www.instagram.com/p/BMkUoIIguCL/?taken-by=acebounce
            </a>
            for reference, the similar photo on Alefantis' Instagram:
            <a href="https://i.sli.mg/H9gUDZ.png">
             https://i.sli.mg/H9gUDZ.png
            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            As someone in the comments mentioned earlier, when Alefantis mentioned his desire to play "ping pong" in London, he may have meant at Bonce Ping Pong. Similarly, remember the email that mentioned Obama getting $65,000 of pizza/dogs flown in from Chicago? Ace Bounce is in Chicago.
           </p>
           <p>
            Take a look at this page where Ace Bounce advertises holiday parties. Does it not look a little strange, considering what we've discovered so far?
            <a href="http://acebounce.com/whats-on/holidays-acebounce">
             http://acebounce.com/whats-on/holidays-acebounce
            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            Another weird coincidence. Here are descriptions for:
           </p>
           <p>
            Bounce Ping Pong:
"1950s'-style cocktail bar and pizza restaurant with red leather booths and
            <strong>
             17
            </strong>
            ping pong tables."
           </p>
           <p>
            Ace Bounce (this one wasn't directly on google search results, I went to the "ping pong parties" section of the website):
"Wander through 16 ping pong tables (and a very special beer pong table), each with their own party going."
So if you included the "very special beer pong table", it would be
            <strong>
             17
            </strong>
            tables
           </p>
           <p>
            Spin NYC (another ping pong bar/pizza restaurant)
"Active, modern lounge with
            <strong>
             17
            </strong>
            Ping-Pong courts, full bar service, dining &amp; live music on weekends."
           </p>
           <p>
            If someone could archive these pages or explain to me how to do it, that would be great.
           </p>
           <p>
            Please don't shit on me if these are just coincidences, I'm just trying to help and leave no stone un-turned. But isn't that picture of the statue of a kid holding the ping pong paddle creepy, especially considering all the bizarre stuff we've encountered so far?

            Bounce Ping Pong Farringdon ABOUT US:
           </p>
           <p>
            Bounce is a ground-breaking social entertainment brand founded by Adam Breeden, entrepreneur, co-founder of Flight Club and former CEO and co-founder of All Star Lanes, and also Dov Penzik, also a successful entrepreneur and former competitive table tennis player. The two founders conceptualized a vision, taking inspiration from the explosion of stylish table tennis social venues stateside and the huge resurgence of interest in the game within the UK.
           </p>
           <p>
            Since its launch in 2012, the Bounce concept has been widely regarded by the industry as a game-changer in social entertainment venues, which combines three elements of hospitality: bar, restaurant and entertainment activity - all set against award-winning design and the highest standard of fit out. Bounce is the world’s leading concept to offer this immersive experience, taking the humble Ping Pong table from the back corner of a bar to become the main offering of the venue, while creating an intricately considered and currently unrivalled leisure experience.
           </p>
           <p>
            <strong>
             Bounce Farringdon, the flagship venue quickly established itself as one of London’s most iconic and most talked about venues and has hosted games for Elle Macpherson, Gwyneth Paltrow &amp;
             <em>

             </em>
             to name but a few.
            </strong>
           </p>
           <p>
            Bounce Old Street officially opened its doors in October 2015.
           </p>
           <p>
            AceBounce Chicago, the first of several planned US venues, launched in June 2016.
           </p>
           <p>
            "The philosophy at Bounce is to exceed expectations in everything we do and to constantly innovate - it's not enough for us to just rely on how fun it is to play ping pong, we aim to create a totally new experience, a Bounce experience." 
Adam Breeden, Founder and CEO of Bounce

             I'm sure I'm stating the obvious, but they're really harping on the word bounce. And bounce is a common term to refer to having sex, especially casually. "Intricate and unrivalled" bounce experience...

             This strikes me as a really stupid business model. You make money with butts in seats. Ping pong tables are large. That square footage could be used for butts in seats, generating revenue. Plus ping pong isn't that great a game.

              I'd like to add, that ping pong is a kind of sports. Movement and fast reactions needed.
Drinking alcohol during sports feels awful, not good.
And what is also important to feel good while making sports: lots of fresh air is needed. In bars and restaurants the air is not suited for higher body activity.
             </p>
             <p>
              And why would MacPherson, Paltrow or Spacey need someone to organize a table tennis game for them? They should be able to make big tourniers with their friends in the best conditions at home. What I want to say is, that what this business claims to offer (ping pong), is nothing special at all.

            I walk past one of these on my way to and from work. In the evenings it has bouncers and it never looks very inviting and always seem to attract a trashy crowd. It has no mention of pizza on the outside, and you can't see into the building from the street. The only room for ping pong is underground. I've walked past this place hundreds of times and I've always got a creepy vibe from the place!

             I went to bed and I couldn't sleep. We don't necessarily need to tie this to Comet Pizza or Besta Pizza or even Hillary. I think it is the Soros, and Rothschild level. 240M in one arm of the business (money laundering) seems like it is out of the league of Hillary.
            </p>
            <p>
             Actually, I think we should continue our scattershot strategy and see what sticks. But keep your eyes open to connections to Soros and Rothschilds and the rest of the Bilderberg group. I think we will find connections to the Clinton Foundation made by members of the Bilderberg group.

             It's a short drive from England to the continent where they can be used. Many people use, trade, keep and have many different currencies. I used marks years ago when they were valuable because I would get more back when exchanging at Asian kiosks, yet I've never been to Germany.

              No euros were not used in England before Brexit. Only a handful of large shops would accept them because we are close to the continent. Euros however are useful for transporting illegal cash because you can get denominations over 50, so large sums of money weigh a lot less. Plus even if you do have a £50 they are difficult to get rid of, because people are worried they are fake. You'd have to go to a bank with it and leave a nice big paper trail.

            This is huge!  It mentions the Panama Papers.  I have no idea what they are, but remember when Wikileaks for started leaking a couple of months ago?  Well, I remember someone on Twitter saying something about, I hope they release the Panama Papers.

            Its right next door. Its owned by a Qatari. they have the pedo symbol in their logo. We know Comet Pizza is pedo. We know they have bands like sex stains that have the same symbol as besta in their music videos.
           </p>
           <p>
            etc etc etc.

            I found the link to besta world by finding Bounce through develclan which is all connected.
           </p>
           <p>
            You honestly think that bounce and comet ping just happen to look exactly the same and have the same themes, while bounce is owned by a shell company out of panama called Besta, which also happens to be the pedo place next door to comet?

            if thats just a coincidence then its the biggest one ive EVER seen.

             WikiLeaks began publishing The Global Intelligence Files – more than five million emails from the Texas-headquartered "global intelligence" company Stratfor. The emails date from between July 2004 and late December 2011. They reveal the inner workings of a company that fronts as an intelligence publisher, but provides confidential intelligence services to large corporations, such as Bhopal’s Dow Chemical Co., Lockheed Martin, Northrop Grumman, Raytheon and government agencies, including the US Department of Homeland Security, the US Marines and the US Defense Intelligence Agency. The emails show Stratfor’s web of informers, pay-off structure, payment-laundering techniques and psychological methods, for example

             A common theory is that Besta and Comet are in direct competition in a client rich geographical area.  Their interactions may be primarily in competition.   What a strange world.

              Well, someone has a theory, and I can't say how common it is.  There are no facts.  There is a similar company name tied into offshore businesses.   I own 3 LLCs, and I am sure there are dozens that have a similar name.

             I'm pretty sure I've never referred to any food as stunning. That's just not a descriptor that goes with food. Nice find.

              Hmm. I'm still not understanding how Pounce Ping Pong is related to any of this besides the picture/comments on Alefantis' instagram. How is Bounce connected to Deveclan?

             This is great stuff. I thought it was already determined that "Besta" was code for "Beast", in which case there's already coincidental name inference. Patience and diligence should provide more concrete clues, considering the other "coincidences" cited.
            </p>
            <p>
             Now the "banking structure" itself? That's just classical CIA shell banking - lot's of accounts, pass throughs, fronts, etc*. If you actually visited these, you might be shocked to find little more than a single-room office or a PO Box. Really. Which is not to discourage anyone, because if this really is an intel op (and it appears to be related) then THAT is precisely why they've kept it this secret for this long - COMPARTMENTALIZATION. Need to know. Etc etc.
            </p>
            <p>
             [* Does anyone here remember the Atlanta BCCI Scandal - dubbed "Banks of Crooks and Criminals International" by investigators? That bank was brought down with JUST ABOUT as much information as is found here, in more detail... and was ALSO directly and indirectly related to the Clintons, via some Asian "business partners"; Chicago journalist Sherman Skolnik has kept up with this, and has good information regarding.]
            </p>
            <p>
             In THAT case, Alefantis himself is likely QUITE IGNORANT about certain sides of this operation, EVEN as he knows "where he stands" in that organizational chart. Same with Besta's owner, the Human Trafficking lawyer dude. They know what they know and do what they do (which is considerable) - though they may or may not be much good for anything else.
            </p>
            <p>
             And frankly, no one wants to know my opinion regarding what they're good for - it's not printable.

             Shows Sealight and Besta are connected. 
Also they do business in the Virgin Islands..... home of Epstein's St. James "Orgy" Island?

             I think Sealight might be an incorporations company.

            <p>
             Scroll down to the bottom of the page (above).
            </p>
            <p>
             Sealightis probably just a lawyer in an office who creates the paperwork for incorporations.
            </p>
            <p>
             This document ties Besta World Group to the Virgin Islands.

            </p>
            <p>
             Why is this document important? It shows the Virgin Islands removed Besta World Group from their record of incorporations. It also establishes a link between Besta World Group in Hong Kong, and creates a link to the Virgin Islands. This places the connection closer to Epstein.

               I have been wondering why in hell she would be involved in a pizza business. The name is off kilter, to me. The site says it is because wild goats used to roam a hill. But the severed goat head logo is so unpleasant......

            If you look at a conspiracy long enough, the Ukrainian mafia will be involved. I did a lot of investigative work on similar lines before Pizzagate, and America/CIA essentially runs smuggling and black ops in Odessa, Ukraine, and they run arms and Captagon (the jihad drug) through Georgia.

             I'll give you one and let's see where it takes us: google Leonid Minin, Odessa Mafiya Kingpin and gun smuggler to Liberian President Charles Taylor in the 1990s. Still alive, living in Italy, but reportedly brain-dead from excessive cocaine use.
            </p>
            <p>
             Taylor was broken out of prison in Massachusetts, 1986, by the CIA.
            </p>
            <p>
             As President, Taylor facilitated between $30 and $130 million worth of sales in blood diamonds to representatives of Al Qaeda in the months leading up to 9/11 (anticipatory money laundering).
            </p>
            <p>
             Taylor conducted arms deals with Slovenian-Australian pedophile Nicholas Oman.
            </p>
            <p>
             Nicholas Oman was a business associate of Licio Gelli, leader of the P2 Freemasonic Lodge in Italy.
            </p>
            <p>
             Oman, Taylor, Viktor Bout, Osama Bin Laden, and a retired CIA officer named Roger D'Onofrio were all involved in selling guns to various factions in the Yugoslav civil war (CIA assets executing the policy of the Clinton administration).
            </p>
            <p>
             Dyncorp was caught trafficking children for sex in Yugoslavia during Clinton's war...
            </p>
            <p>
             And that's just scratching the surface.

             Clinton Pride’s 8(a) Pig Farm Bridge – Serco Zulu Server Snuff –Soros's Patented Voter Key
Hillary Clinton used DOJ Pride 8(a) actors to blackmail mentors of FBCA – including erstwhile directors of Boeing, Lockheed Martin, Raytheon and Northrop Grumman – with child pornography originating from a B.C. pig farm. In early 2001, Clinton's 8(a) companies used Starnet to set up a server to the federal bridge in the basement of her NY home where she used Serco signals to synchronize and watch‘the first live-broadcast mass snuff film on 9/11. Serco 8(a) companies at USPTO have issued...

Marine Brief – Pig Farm Scripts on Clinton Server – Starnet Bets on Benghazi Deaths – Serco 8(a) Digital Fires
From Plum City Online - (AbelDanger.net) - June 17, 2015

              <p>
               Hillary Clinton has allegedly been registering scripts on her server for use in pay-per-view snuff-film betting following a Dark Web model for a Piggy's Palace charity launched in 1996 by David Johnston, Governor General of Canada, at the Pickton Family pig farm in British Columbia.

             </li>
             <li>
              <p>
               Clinton agents allegedly used a 9/11/12 pig-farm script from Sidney Blumenthal to set up a Starnet (now World Gaming) playbook and take bets on the predicted time of death of the former SEALs Glen Doherty and Tyrone S. Woods on the roof of the CIA "Annex" in Benghazi.

             </li>
             <li>
              <p>
               Clinton agents allegedly positioned a drone over the CIA annex to send video directly to Obama's 8(a) Cabinet in the White House in support of online pig-farm snuff-film betting where the precise time of death of the former SEALS was determined by the atomic clock of Serco Digital Fires.

             McConnell is offering to serve as an expert witness in any action for wrongful deaths related to Clinton's support for online assassination betting and Serco digital fires during the attacks of 9/11/2001 and 9/11/2012.

              It isn't the International Criminal Court in the Hague, which has it's own webpage, which is not that one.
             </p>
             <p>
              I can't find any information about what they are claiming and the ICC list of warrants and arrests is found in a variety of places that are not correlating with what that site has to say.

             Not sure if this is related but FBI anon had hinted at Kosovo being a place the Clintons were interested in. He basically asked "what is it about Kosovo that would make them interested?" I haven't had time to look into it but thought I'd throw it out in case anyone has run across any connections possibly dealing in money laundering, drugs, trafficking etc.

              can't find you the links at this moment, but the plan of globalism is to eliminate independent countries -- something like 17 less countries exist compared to 10 yrs ago??? -- same with the european union -- to slowly eliminate the control each country has and move it towards a central authority

              Kosovo and the entirety of eastern europe were completely overrun by Russian/Soviet linked gangsters. They sold guns to everyone, even the enemies of their countrymen. Involved in drugs/guns/cigarettes/prostitution, so it makes sense they were trafficking in humans as well. The worst scum on earth. Im sure the Clintons were very interested.

              Camp Bondsteel.  Kosovo is basically a rump state, a place that exists solely to provide a military presence for 'the West'.  Divide and conquer.  I suspect you would find all the usual suspect activity there, arms smuggling, human trafficking, drug smuggling, intel operations, torture, and that's without even looking into it.

               Links to drug smuggling (is almost always tied to intelligence organizations, who use it to finance black operations, i.e. to avoid paperwork  and their official budget), terrorism, 'prostitution' (which is human trafficking+slavery).  Tied to Halliburton (who built the place), so all the usual suspects.  Oil pipelines.   The whole shebang.

              I am not a shill.   There really are two Andrew J Klines who are lawyers in Washington DC.     The restaurant lawyer has had his picture published in food service magazine articles:
              <a href="http://i.imgur.com/M4DDQyO.png">
               Nov 2015 issue of Foodservice Monthly
              </a>
              It might be theoretically possible that they still could be the same person, but it would seem crazy to go all that effort to never to be seen in person and so on.  And to what end?   It really would not make any sense.   It is damaging to the cause when we jump to conclusions too easily.

              Calm down, it's not a total shill thing. Andrew Kline is shown as owner ~2006 in one document through "Uptown Pizza LLC". Later his name doesn't appear attached anymore as far as I can tell. And it's a "Big Cheese LLC" involved. We need a timeline on this.

              Just going to throw it out there... You sure it said Tiblisi and not Thaci?
             </p>
             <p>
              This is from 03/28/2011
             </p>
             <p>
              Last December Hashim Thaci, the Prime Minister of Kosovo, was alleged to be "the head of a 'mafia-like' Albanian group responsible for smuggling weapons, drugs and human organs through eastern Europe, according to a Council of Europe inquiry report on organized crime" as then reported by Paul Lewis for the Guardian.
Notwithstanding the seriousness of the allegations which have been seconded by many others, the United States continues to embrace Thaci with a callous indifference for the purported victims as reported by Matt McAllester for the GlobalPost:
             </p>
             <p>
              Secretary of State Hillary Clinton visited him in Kosovo as recently as the fall. "I want you to know, prime minister," Clinton said to Thaci, during her visit to Pristina on Oct. 13 last year, "that just as we have been with you on the hard road to independence, we will stay with you. We are your partners and we are your friends and we are very committed to your future."
The United States is fully aware of the allegations in all their sordid glory -- indeed, many of the claims are repeated in NATO intelligence reports -- and yet a nation which supposedly respects human rights and vaunts the rule of law inexplicably chooses to look the other way.

              Georgia was a big part of the 'ratline' that allowed European arms companies to ship resources and arms to Syria through Turkey. It was conveniently available as a safe staging point after the brief conflict in South Ossetia. Wikileaks emails detail the exact same offshore scheme of replacing end-use-certificates on weapons so that they can be smuggled into Syria/Iraq. The state department knew about it but it persisted.
             </p>
             <p>
              As for the tinfoil aspect, Georgia and Ukraine are central to what I would call America's covert agro-ops i.e. spooks working with Chemonics, Monsanto, Cargill, USAID. Part of it is just basic espionage done under the guise of agro-investment.

              "Besta" is "beast" in portuguese too, and is used not only to denote some animals, but also the Devil ("A Besta": "The Beast").

             Bounce Ping Pong is owned by Develclan.

             You think Bounce and Comet aren't related? Just take a look at them.

            Ok so now all we need is a District Attourney with balls to slap the whole crew with a RICO case and arrest them for racketeering? Where's Harvey dent when you need him?

             My suggestions of who to contact that I think are trustworthy and knowledgeable:
Judge Andrew Napolitano
Judge Jeanine Porto (former DA and judge of Westchester County)
Not sure about Mayor Rudy Guilani (but RICO was one of his specialities, and he DESPISES HC)
Judicial Watch
They may at the least be able to direct you who to contact.
edit: spelling
