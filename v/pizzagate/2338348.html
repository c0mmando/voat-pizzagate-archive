            Sorry, Vindicator.  To be more exact, the video makes reference to national child sex trafficking rings being run out of Chicago and Dallas.  Serial  killer Dean Corll claimed to have sold boys to a "sexual slavery ring operating from Dallas."  Corll used another young man called Elmer Wayne Henley to procure boys &amp; young men, promising Henley $200 for every child he brought him.  Around that time, an individual named John D. Norman founded in Dallas a paedophile ring known as the Odyssey Foundation.  Subscribers to the foundation (numbered 50,000 at its height which reportedly included, "prominent people and some federal employees in Washington".  Norman kept index cards with details of the Foundation's membership, but they were "inexplicably" destroyed by police!) would be supplied with young boys to rape, as well as pornographic images of their victims.  Norman was eventually caught &amp; sent to prison, but served only a short sentence, after which he relocated to Chicago where he was jailed for raping a 10 year old boy.  Whilst in prison for this offence, he started a paedophile newsletter known as Delta.  It is speculated in the video that the Greek letter Delta (shaped like a triangle) may have been the origins of the paedophile 'boy lover' symbol found in the now notorious declassified FBI document.
           </p>
           <p>
            Meanwhile, the mother of a boy named Michael Marino (reported missing in 1976), who was said to be one of Chicago serial killer John Wayne Gacy's victims, discovered via DNA testing that the body in her son's grave was in fact not that of her child.  Michael was last seen alive mere blocks away from John D. Norman's address (as in Dallas, Norman kept index cards with names &amp; addresses of not only his customers but also his victims and, similar to Dallas, those index cards were "lost" by the Homewood P.D.!).  It appears now that Gacy was not acting alone, but rather had accomplices, most likely Norman's nationwide child sex trafficking ring.  Gacy was well connected politically (you've probably all seen the photo of him with then FLOTUS Rosalynn Carter) and supposedly when he was arrested, one of the first things he asked the police was, "Who else do you have in custody?"
           </p>
           <p>
            TL;DR This story relates to Pizzagate as it is a proto-Pizzagate story of nationwide child sex trafficking most likely involving prominent people (the loss and destruction of crucial evidence in both Dallas and Chicago would strongly suggest as much).

             Thanks for posting this-there is another in this series that he does that I can no longer find that focuses on Wayne Williams and the Atlanta child murders. They mention a cult and it would be really relevant if we could find that episode as it ties in with the trafficking and cult activities.

               Thanks, this one is important too, but there's another that's downright damning about witnesses to a satanic cult in relation to it. Still haven't found the link since seeing it a few months ago
