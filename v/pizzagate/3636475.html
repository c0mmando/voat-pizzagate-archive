This incident was the root cause of her death. Warning, this is a very stomach churning lead!</p>

<p>Timeline: </p>
<p>-Poltergeist Series. Three incidents over a period of 5 years ranging from 1982 to summer of 1987. The crimes themselves occured in Simi Valley, California, Culver City, CA, Altadena, CA, and Chicago, Illinois. Suspects: Steven Spielberg, Frank Marshall.</p>
<p>Accomplices: Judy Wix</p>
<p>-Happy Days: Most Likely Suspects: Garry Marshall (dead), Bobby Hoffman (dead), Henry Winkler, Tom Hanks, Rob Reiner. Accomplice: Penny Marshall (dead).</p>
<p>-The Fatal Incident. Note that this incident is the START of Heather\'s fatal down turn rather than a quick death. Location: On the set of Rocky Road. Hollywood, California.</p>
<p>Time: November 7, 1986. The incident backstage involved anally violating her with a foreign object. 3 men were involved. Execs flocked to the studio, so its possible for a culprit to be one of the flockers. A medic was called in likely because what they did perforated her colon. The injury was severe enough that it also inflicted either penetrative or blunt force trauma on her small intestine, more specifically, her ileum. For this reason, I suspect that the object itself was a hard object. Possibly made of metal or some other hard material. I’d say the object in question was about 10-14” long. Heather\'s illness (the one that was covered up) first started to manifest around December 1986. I suspect that the Chrons diagnosis was the cover up. The episode was released in May of 1987. She was on medication throughout filming of Poltergeist 3 as her condition worsened. Heather\'s health took its fatal downward spiral on 1/31/1988 before she died on 2/1/1988. The funeral was an open casket event on 2/5/1988. The &quot;skinning&quot; was most likely on the following night, with the casket being looted. This crime is fully possible because Heather was interred in an above ground mausolium according to accounts of those who attended the funeral. </p>
<p>Suspects (Rocky Road): Gene Abravaya, Arthur Annecharico, Chris Colombus, Richard Vane.</p>
<p>Accomplice (others): Wesley Staples. Corey Feldman. He actively covers for the big pedowood names and their crimes, which would make him an accomplice. Other accomplices include the MSM, Patrick Little and Tom Steyer due to their involvement in the attempted false flag along with Gabe Hoffman for protecting Steven Spielberg. Fredrick Brennan for deplatforming 8chan, a site that was providing informants in this case.</p>
<p>-Cause of Death: Sepsis infection and intestinal stenosis of the ileum (last 1/3 of small intestine) due to repeated anal rape related injuries and infections. The main incident responsible was the injury to her small intestines as a result of the Rocky Road incident.</p>',

           The account of a registered nurse specializing in pediatrics. Seems to suggest that injury to small intestines may not be nessecary for that stenosis to form. Also, Heather looked normal during Poltergeist 3. Pudginess is normal for preteens (her eyes and skin looked normal).

           Seinfeld too.
          </p>
          <p>
           Timeline:
          </p>
          <p>
           -Poltergeist Series. Three incidents over a period of 5 years ranging from 1982 to summer of 1987. The crimes themselves occured in Simi Valley, California, Culver City, CA, Altadena, CA, and Chicago, Illinois. Suspects: Steven Spielberg, Frank Marshall.
          </p>
          <p>
           Accomplices: Judy Wix
          </p>
          <p>
           -Happy Days: Most Likely Suspects: Garry Marshall (dead), Bobby Hoffman (dead), Henry Winkler, Tom Hanks, Rob Reiner. Accomplice: Penny Marshall (dead).
          </p>
          <p>
           -The Fatal Incident. Note that this incident is the START of Heather's fatal down turn rather than a quick death. Location: On the set of Rocky Road. Hollywood, California.
          </p>
          <p>
           Time: November 7, 1986. The incident backstage involved anally violating her with a foreign object. 3 men were involved. Execs flocked to the studio, so its possible for a culprit to be one of the flockers. A medic was called in likely because what they did perforated her colon. The injury was severe enough that it also inflicted either penetrative or blunt force trauma on her small intestine, more specifically, her ileum. For this reason, I suspect that the object itself was a hard object. Possibly made of metal or some other hard material. I’d say the object in question was about 10-14” long. Heather's illness (the one that was covered up) first started to manifest around December 1986. I suspect that the Chrons diagnosis was the cover up. The episode was released in May of 1987. She was on medication throughout filming of Poltergeist 3 as her condition worsened. Heather's health took its fatal downward spiral on 1/31/1988 before she died on 2/1/1988. The funeral was an open casket event on 2/5/1988. The "skinning" was most likely on the following night, with the casket being looted. This crime is fully possible because Heather was interred in an above ground mausolium according to accounts of those who attended the funeral.
          </p>
          <p>
           Suspects (Rocky Road): Gene Abravaya, Arthur Annecharico, Chris Colombus, Richard Vane.
          </p>
          <p>
           Accomplice (others): Wesley Staples. Corey Feldman. He actively covers for the big pedowood names and their crimes, which would make him an accomplice. Other accomplices include the MSM, Patrick Little and Tom Steyer due to their involvement in the attempted false flag along with Gabe Hoffman for protecting Steven Spielberg. Fredrick Brennan for deplatforming 8chan, a site that was providing informants in this case.
          </p>
          <p>
           -Cause of Death: Sepsis infection and intestinal stenosis of the ileum (last 1/3 of small intestine) due to repeated anal rape related injuries and infections. The main incident responsible was the injury to her small intestines as a result of the Rocky Road incident.

            Thanks again for your good work. This is a very important topic. I did want to say-- I saw poltergeist 3 when it came out, and she always looked odd/sick/on some sort or medication, to me. The kind that causes those "moon cheeks." Bless her soul.

             Didn’t notice moon cheeks. Because  I saw the first one. Totally unaware of what I would see. I had nightmares. I never knew SS was involved til I came here. I blocked the movie out of my mind til these posts. I was so glad I never saw one of his movies. I never liked him. He gave me the creeps. I found out why. RIP Heather RIP Judith

              It's just in part 3 that she has what even she called "chipmunk cheeks" from the medication she was on. She did Not look like herself in part 3. I remember being disturbed by it. I had a classmate when I was In Jr high who temporarily got "moon face" from the medication she was taking.

               That must have been hard to look at her being a Child and all. In those days we wouldn’t think about what we know today. So sad that she had to suffer like that and afraid to speak out.

               I think that is the idea: distract, disrupt, demoralize. It's so nice to have a downvote button. I constantly find myself on Twitter wanting to downvote stuff, and then I remember I'm not on Voat. :-)
