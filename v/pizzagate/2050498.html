<h2>Retired NYPD Detective Sergeant Mike Codella reports ties between a criminal biker gang and an elite Satanic group that raped children and sacrificed a missing child (when the child was older)</h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A <strong>pedophile and otherwise criminal biker gang</strong> were <strong>hired by elites</strong> in New York state <strong>to provide security around their mansions during Satanic rituals, including sacrifice of a known missing child,</strong> who was older at the time of his death.  
</p>
<p>This was reported to Mike Codella in the 1990\'s by someone who was found to be credible.</p>
<p>Video:  from 41:00, missing child detail is at 46:05</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BrLQCKmyGK4"><strong>Mike Codella NYPD Investigated Son of Sam &amp; Process Church Cult (2017)</strong></a></p>
<p> &nbsp;</p>
<p>More details, including from 27:40 - 31:15:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>In the 1990\'s the informant, a <a href="https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4358/36294084132_48a6cf50e2_o.png">1% biker</a>  <a href="http://archive.is/9PTDd">Source</a> who had been in prison for 15 years, contacted the NYPD to give information in the hopes they would provide a letter recommending his parole</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>1% may also be a &quot;secret&quot; yet &quot;out-in-the-open&quot; reference tying outlaw motorcycle gangs to &quot;the 1% elites&quot;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The parties were held in Yonkers, 20 miles north of NYC, and at other homes within the affluent county of <a href="http://archive.is/MkI5J">Westchester</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The informant was vice president of the gang which was called the Rat Pack</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>He was incarcerated for CSA against his daughter; his wife had committed the same against their son, and other members of their gang were also pedophiles</strong> </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The retired NYPD detective sergeant said people became involved with the <strong>[Process Church]</strong> cult for &quot;sex [including rape of children], drugs, rock \'n roll&quot; and the Satanic rituals were a backdrop   
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Eventually the informant and the president of the Rat Pack ingratiated themselves with the elites, and became high priests in the cult</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The informant said the rich people at the rituals used aliases</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Despite this, one cult member was I.D.\'d and tracked to his Florida car dealership and questioned.  When the officers returned to question him some more, they found the dealership shut down and the suspect no longer around.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Finally, connections have been posted recently between Ordo Templi Orientis/OTO and Pizza-Pedogate.  Just to note some sources <a href="http://archive.is/sS8ID">claim <strong>the OTO created the Process Church cult.</strong></a>  
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<hr />
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It\'s possible the elites combine the dressed-in-black, SWAT-like security teams for their murder parties that we more often hear of, together with outlaw biker gang security/interference running, even to this day.</p>
<p>The elites are said to commit SRA and murder in <strong>publicly owned, wooded areas</strong> as well.  It seems the <strong>OMG\'s/outlaw motorcycle gangs would likely be placed in areas of state parks, forest preserves and the like, to keep people away and to cause disruptions if need be,</strong> depending on where the rituals take place.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>By the way, I\'m not accusing <strong>Laura Silsby Gayler\'s husband</strong> of anything, just pointing out that Norman Wade Gayler was reportedly <a href="http://archive.is/2X58F">a serial <strong>criminal and biker gang member</strong></a> in the past. </p>
<p>See <a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/2049722">Laura Silsby Became Laura Gayler When She Married Norman \'Wade\' Gayler, Regional Director of Emergency Services At Red Cross</a> by <a href="https://voat.co/user/pig_lifter">@pig_lifter</a></p>

            I grew up around Bikers and a lot of them were in the Outlaws. A large majority of them have been to prison and live by that code rapist and child molesters are scum and end up severally disabled or dead.
           </p>
           <p>
            I've seen Bikers more than once kicking the shit out of someone for messing with kids. Example: I was about nine we were at some Harley swapmeet myself and some other kids were out playing when some drunk Mexican with half a six pack in his hand started talking to us then pulls out his dick and starts pissing in front of us . We ran and told the parents next thing you know five bikers are kicking the shit out of this guy I remember the Mexican guy getting slammed to the ground and his beer busting open and spaying everywhere.
           </p>
           <p>
            I call Bullshit because of my life experience around these guys.

             Wow I had no idea how I unintentionally misrepresented my thoughts until I read your comment, thank you so much!!!  (Written expression is hard for me sometimes.)  Everyone knows the overwhelming majority of motorcycle club members are honorable people, but I didn't make it sound that way, accidentally.
            </p>
            <p>
             I edited my original post to clarify, and also deleted the source article for the "1%" paragraph screen cap, because the Wikipedia title is "Outlaw Motorcycle Clubs," which isn't about the
             <strong>
              criminal 1% gangs
             </strong>
             I was talking about, alone.  It's just the source.  I apologize for the mistakes.  Also your story brought tears to my eyes, by that I mean tears of happiness for you that you had good parents.
            </p>
            <p>
             I mangled some other things too, people seemed to think I thought this was a case we could solve.  But no, I'm just saying, 1%'ers may be people who can tell us a LOT in one way or another, and it was good to hear this story directly from Michael Cordell (in addition to Jim Rothstein's retelling of it in his great interviews.)

              Ah, thanks for the clarification.  Then maybe the forum honchos might want to look at calling the depraved child raping, torturing, murdering cabal something other than elites.  I have no doubt the cabal was behind the now common term.  Then again of what nature are the forum honchos if they promote and sustain the erroneous reference?  Inquiring minds...

            All right I know from my own personal investigations that SPENCER BENNETT was running the local chapter of the Hand of Death Cult in Jacksonville, that sent Lucas &amp; Toole out on assignments. And when I went to the Jax car dealership he had owned, I found it had been taken over by his nephew. BENNETT himself was murdered, probably a hit called out by a certain Jax rogue cop. A low-Q black guy called Popeye went to prison for that one, case closed.

             Woah, I wonder if Spencer Bennett is the person Mike Codell was talking about.  I can't go through that two hour interview again, but I think Codell said he met the informant in prison in 1996-1997?  Is that around the same time Spencer Bennett's dealership changed hands? (I'm not sure how long after the initial meeting at the prison that NYPD officers went to Florida.)
            </p>
            <p>
             Codell said he couldn't remember where the dealership was, but he thought maybe Daytona.  I just checked and that's only an hour and a half from Jacksonville, and they are both on the northeast coast of Florida, so for such a large state they're in the same "general area".
            </p>
            <p>
             Edit to add:
            </p>
            <p>
             If a NY-based 1% biker knew about, essentially, "Son of Sam" killings even after Berkowitz went to prison (that didn't make the news) (it's somewhere in that interview), and, knew the name and business of someone heading a Florida death cult that oversaw other serial killers' killings, this is making my head spin.  I mean we all suspected something like this, but seeing something potentially plain as day like that, it's ghastly.

              Sounds like it was probably the same cult. Bennett lived &amp; worked in JAX but the cult rendezvous with the hoods etc happened "way out in the woods" of No Fla. and they also had a camp at one time more southerly, towards the Everglades. That one was probably the encampment where Lucas was initiated.

            do you mean create distractions like forest fires in national parks? or perhaps "missing 411" people who stumble upon them?

             I didn't get the sense Codell meant either of those things, but the interview is too long for me to listen to again.  I thought he meant create a "smaller scale" disturbance if necessary, to divert police.  To be honest what you're saying makes way more sense though!

              EDIT
             </strong>
             to add:
            </p>
            <p>
             Codell was talking about 'security plus run interference/create distraction if need be' regarding rich people's homes and mansions, and therefore whatever land they were on, in Westchester County, NY.
            </p>
            <p>
             I had extrapolated from that, regarding what victims have reported about 'elites' committing SRA in publicly-owned wooded areas, so I have edited the OP to clarify that.

             it's not sexist to point that out, but it would be sexist to imply that there was anything inherent about it. obviously both genders are involved so perhaps it has nothing to do with gender.

            Mae Brussel -a great woman and investigator.
(She was suicided around 1988.)
           </p>
           <p>
            She did a radio broadcast about 'son of sam'.
I recommend it.

                You were 100 % right, though.

                No forensic evidence.
               </p>
               <p>
                Yes, when she started slamming Col Aquino..Manhattan Beach's McMartin Pre-School.
               </p>
               <p>
                oooh. They hated it when she started talking crying out about
               </p>
               <p>
                satism  there in the military.  That topic.  Are you kidding?  A real 'no. no'.
               </p>
               <p>
                She was broadcasting  and exposing mind control.
               </p>
               <p>
                So much.
               </p>
               <p>
                She worked before internet.
               </p>
               <p>
                She had to hire translators as she subscribed to many
               </p>
               <p>
                international newspapers.
               </p>
               <p>
                She died in 1988.
               </p>
               <p>
                Mae's daughter was in a suspicious auto vehicle accident.
I think she died. They did not stop Mae there.

            Thanks for the post. I hate to sound like Debbie the Downer but we first saw this story 9 months ago. It came out when people traced down Laura Silsby's background. Note the date on that Ed Opperman interview of Mike Codella:  Jan 6, 2017.
           </p>
           <p>
            O_O
           </p>
           <p>
            Nothing has happened with respect to this story and nothing will ever happen sadly. This story involved elites and elites run this country and don't particularly enjoy being arrested, tried, convicted and sent to prison like normal people.
           </p>
           <p>
            All the evidence is there along with all the leads the FBI or any other Law Enforcement organization would need. The NYPD has made a few brief forays into doing the right thing but are immediately shut down.
           </p>
           <p>
            The best thing we could do at this point is acknowledge the owners of this country are above the law. The problem isn't the elites at this point. It's like fool me once shame on you. Fool me twice shame on me. The problem is the average American is asleep and doesn't particularly relish the thought of waking up.
           </p>

              As far as I know they're still importing cocaine into military air force bases TO THIS DAY. Offutt Air Force Base in Nebraska is the biggest. Nebraska of course is where, ding ding ding, Seth Rich and family are from. I think the father may have even worked at the base at some point but I'm not sure.

              Ed's got a bunch of good interviews concerning the Process church stuff and other relevant topics. Be warned, he's socialist minded and not the biggest fan of Trump tho which I think turns a lot of voatish type peeps off, but he does great work IMO. If you haven't checked out his Det Jim Rothstein interviews, they're worth a listen also.

               , exactly!! Love Opperman and most of his interviews and his personality, but yep, he's a socialist and isn't a Trump fan. Big turn off but I know that he means well.

             I appreciate your comment.

             Searchvoat.co is down today, and I couldn't find it posted when I searched -- Mike Codella voat Pizzagate, nor Biker gangs voat pizzagate.

             You're not a Debbie Downer!   My point was just -- this might be happening in other places, to this day.  All the more reason for us to avoid places where 1%'s/OMG's are, and for righteous law enforcement to at least take note of where they are -- until something can be done.
