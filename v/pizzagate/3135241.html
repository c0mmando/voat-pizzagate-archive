             May sound selfish, and off topic, but I have always known Hickory as a really nice town, until 2007/8, when our family property got stolen by people working at the county tax office. I was blamed for not letting others know, and it did damage to our family structure. Criminals are usually opportunistic in nature and hang with others like them. Point being, I knew right then and there that something drastic had changed in Hickory since the 70's.

               Nope. I already got interviewed by a three letter. I, and my family are so angry about this, that it will boil over in real life, and there is no stopping that. Thanks for your concern, and I do the same for everyone.

            Green was taken into custody in the early morning hours of March 31, soon after he allegedly engaged in a felony sex act with a 14-year-old at the Baymont Inn on Hendersonville Road, according to Christina Hallingse, spokeswoman for Asheville Police Department. Hallingse confirmed the child was "known to the suspect prior to the incident."

            This week, we welcomed four students spending a year at Hickory High School as part of the AFS-USA foreign student exchange program, coordinated locally by our own Dan Green. Dan introduced us to Lara from Turkey, Peak from Thailand, Vivian from Austria and the effervescent Mina from Tunisia. Sergeant at Arms Wayne challenged various victims to interpret a sentence from each of the guests in their native language, which raked in a good quantity of dollar fines.

             He's charged with crimes against one child.  I hope they're also looking into whether he molested the foreign exchange students he's hosted since 1991.  This creep requires a sentence long enough to keep him off the streets forever.

            This was the heir to the Biltmore Estate, a relative of Gloria Vanderbilt, who died two years ago:

            These were his relatives:

            </p>
            <p>
             Cecil is also survived by his brother,

             </strong>
             , 92, who headed the Biltmore Farms development company for decades.

            Maybe this judge was involved in the cover up of whatever shit was going down at the Biltmore Estate.
           </p>
           <p>
            Given the comments about this being the same area as that estate (along with findings), I believe this gives stronger evidence to my theory that children are regularlly being tortured/murdered there, with the paintings depicting actual events.
