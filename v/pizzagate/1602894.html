             I believe you .  I believe all of it.  This is going on in the US as well.  The Archdiocese of St Louis is involved here as they are in other hub cities as well (which I and others have not confirmed yet) but it is so very obvious it is all connected.  The Big Question Is What The Hell Are We Going To Do About This?

              what can we do? the people are feared by these elites yet they use fear to lord over us.
a few of them and billions of us.
if we want to do something one good idea would be releasing ourselves to the need of the corrupt and fake monetary system as we  all know the countries are in debt and we are working paying off bills that is forcing us to not research the great deception of keeping us down with illusioned fake happiness that makes us not want to see the dark hiding in shadows.

               Well, there are those that will not be able to handle the info that you and I have been reading.  I guess it is up to us to make a difference.  The news must break out and when it does people will be shocked.  The problem for the elites is that most people will believe it, for they are sick and tired of being pushed down by them.  They know what they are capable of.  Only a few skeptics will exist.  I have a feeling things will start breaking soon.  Very soon.

                the iceburg has been sighted, the pedo stuff connects worldwide, now imagine a unification of the people standing together against pedophilism. We better start watching NAMBLA, cant believe those guys never got hunted down, at least tptb are trembling at the wealth of info of dirt being released upon them. Gods chosen people are the people, nevermind people that elevate themselves over others.

              An organized system of abduction, exploitation, torture and murder of large numbers of women and children appears to exist on Canada ’s west coast, and is operated and protected in part by sectors of the RCMP, the Vancouver Police Department (VPD), the judiciary, and members of the British Columbia government and federal government of Canada , including the Canadian military.
             </p>
            </li>
            <li>
             <p>
              This system is highly funded and linked to criminal organizations including the Hell’s Angels, the Hong Kong Triad, and unnamed individual “free lance” mobsters from Vancouver and the USA. It is funded in part by a massive drug trade, with which it is intimately connected.
             </p>
            </li>
            <li>
             <p>
              This system is decades-old and has been supplied for many years with women and children from aboriginal reserves and residential schools, with the paid collusion of lawyers, clergy and officials of the Roman Catholic, Anglican and United Church of Canada, along with state-funded aboriginal leaders and officials of the Department of Indian Affairs.
             </p>
            </li>
            <li>
             <p>
              This system is international in scope, Vancouver being one spoke in a wheel of pedophilia, sex slavery, human organ black markets, “snuff” films and violent child pornography that has outlets throughout the Pacific Rim world, particularly in China and Thailand .
             </p>
            </li>
            <li>
             <p>
              This system relies upon a network of complicity extending to the highest levels of power in Canada and other nations, involving coroners, judges, doctors, clergy, politicians and social workers, as well as the media. It also relies upon a network of “body dumping grounds” and mass graves, located in remote rural areas or on aboriginal reserves and both church and Crown land, where human remains are regularly disposed of by RCMP officers.
             </p>
            </li>
            <li>
             <p>
              This system is kept in place because of a practice and philosophy of unofficial tolerance and protection by the established police, judicial, military, church and governmental institutions in Canada and elsewhere. The crimes committed by individual officers of the police, churches, court and government against women and children caught in this system are known and tolerated by these institutions.

             Eyewitness Accounts
            </p>
            <p>
             Eyewitness #1: Caucasian woman, age forty nine, domiciled in Vancouver at 2618 West 8th Avenue , ph: 778-386-7024. Given name of witness is Annie PARKER, who claims to have personal knowledge of the allegations made herein. Statement video-recorded on 16 February 2006, in Vancouver .
            </p>
            <ol>
             <li>
              <p>
               The witness states that during the spring of 2000, she was severely assaulted by an officer of the RCMP, Bruce MICHAELSON, in her Vancouver home after requesting RCMP assistance to deal with harassment from her ex-husband. MICHAELSON tortured the witness and compelled her to join what she terms “the hooker game”, where she learned the facts alleged herein.
              </p>
             </li>
             <li>
              <p>
               The alleged “hooker game” is a protected system run by Vancouver police and RCMP officers in which prostitutes are arrested, drugged, raped and sometimes filmed as part of violent pornographic and “snuff” movies, in which they are tortured and killed on film. The women killed in this manner are then disposed of at special body dumping sites monitored by the police.
              </p>
             </li>
             <li>
              <p>
               The witness claims that there are two levels of the “hooker game”: the simplest level involves the arrest, drugging and raping of prostitutes, then releasing them. The witness estimates that at least one-quarter of all Vancouver policemen take part in this level of the “hooker game”, and that the rest of the police force as well as the Mayor and Chief of Police are aware of it. The higher level of the game involves the use of prostitutes in snuff and pornographic films, and in torturing and murdering them. While unaware of the details of the more extreme level of the game, most police know of its existence but do not betray it or its practitioners for fear that their involvement in the lower level of the game will be exposed.
              </p>
             </li>
             <li>
              <p>
               The witness claims that the drug most commonly used on victims of the “hooker game” is SCOPALAMINE, a hypnotic barbituate often termed a “rape drug”, in which the victim is “zombified”, obeying any command, and then is unable to remember the events for some time. However, memory can return, and the fear of this occurring has prompted MICHAELSON and other participants in the more extreme game to murder the victims and dispose of their bodies. MICHAELSON is the key actor in this body disposal system, according to the witness.
              </p>
             </li>
             <li>
              <p>
               Soon after the assault of the witness by MICHAELSON in the spring of 2000, she was taken by MICHAELSON to one of the locations of the “hooker game”: a “clubhouse” for policemen in either the penthouse of the Century Plaza Hotel or in the basement of the Hotel Georgia in downtown Vancouver . Witness claims that this clubhouse hosts a “pornographic film studio where woman are raped and tortured on film”. MICHAELSON is described by the witness as “a pimp and drug dealer for all the Vancouver cops and their friends … a lot of the dealing goes on at the clubhouse.”
              </p>
             </li>
             <li>
              <p>
               Witness states that MICHAELSON works out of a North Vancouver RCMP detachment and is on the city drug squad, having access to large volumes of illicit drugs that he sells to policemen and others.
              </p>
             </li>
             <li>
              <p>
               At one of the clubhouses described in Point No. 5, the witness was introduced by MICHAELSON to Willy PICTON and Steven PICTON, who ran and continue to run a pornography and snuff film business from Port Coquitlam (alias “Piggy’s Palace”). The witness was subsequently taken by Steven PICTON to the Port Coquitlam site (alias “Piggy’s Palace”) on several occasions to engage in sex and drugs. At this site, she witnessed young girls being drugged and raped, including on film, after being brought to the site by RCMP officers. Witness describes seeing three RCMP officers, including MICHAELSON, at Piggy’s Palace, engaged in drugs and in raping women. Witness states that “ten of the twelve recently murdered women were last seen in the company of RCMP guys.”
              </p>
             </li>
             <li>
              <p>
               At Piggy’s Palace the witness also met Jean-Guy BOUDRAIS or BEAUDRAIS, whom witness claims is the serial killer responsible for the murder of many of the women in the downtown eastside of Vancouver over the past ten years. Witness states that BOUDRAIS is a close associate of MICHAELSON, obtains women and drugs from him, and relies on MICHAELSON to dispose of his victims after he has raped, tortured and killed them. Witness says that BOUDRAIS works for a computer programming company tied to the Canadian military or the federal government, and gives seminars in Ontario and Montreal , where he is domiciled. Witness claims that BOUDRAIS, like MICHAELSON, is a Freemason.
              </p>
             </li>
             <li>
              <p>
               Witness claims that Steven PICTON is the ringleader of the snuff film operation that formerly operated out of Piggy’s Palace, and which has now moved to an undisclosed location in Coquitlam. One of PICTON’s associates operates a front for snuff films out of a company named “Goodbye Girls” at 999 West Broadway in Vancouver. Witness claims that snuff film victims’ bodies are weighted with cement blocks and dumped in Beaver Lake in Stanley Park .
              </p>
             </li>
             <li>
              <p>
               Witness claims that a snuff film network in Vancouver involves MICHAELSON, a CBC cameraman named Gerry DUNNE associated with Pogo Productions, a film maker named Dave COLLINS who owns Lions Gate Studios, an underworld enforcer named LARRY, a porn film star named Tom TASSE, and the PICTON brothers. TASSE worked in a snuff film studio in the basement of a North Vancouver home a few blocks from MICHAELSON’s RCMP office. Snuff films sell for up to $250,000 and have eager buyers in Asian countries and the USA .
              </p>
             </li>
             <li>
              <p>
               Witness was told by MICHAELSON that he acts as the main supplier of women and drugs for this snuff film network and for the “hooker game” with the assistance of three “dirty cops”: a local policeman named Bob KRISKO, and two RCMP officers named DAVE and STEVEN. Both of the latter cops are associated with the Missing Women’s Task Force and use this position to prey on and rape/murder street women in Vancouver .
              </p>
             </li>
             <li>
              <p>
               Witness claims that both DAVE and STEVEN are also associated with BOUDRAIS and have raped and murdered women with him, including Brianne VOTH, age 19, who was abducted, raped and drowned in 2004 in Coquitlam by BOUDRAIS and STEVEN, in association with a prostitute named Stella MALLOWAY.
              </p>
             </li>
             <li>
              <p>
               Witness was told by MICHAELSON that either DAVE or STEVEN own a cabin that serves as a body dumping site for women killed by them, BOUDRAIS and others. The cabin is located ten minutes’ drive west of Horseshoe Bay on the Sea to Sky Highway , in a hunting camp off a dirt road. Bodies are dumped in a metal cistern at this site.
              </p>
             </li>
             <li>
              <p>
               Witness states that MICHAELSON introduced her to BOUDRAIS in 2002 and BOUDRAIS abducted her and drove her to this body dumping site. When witness began screaming and claimed that others knew she was with him, BOUDRAIS returned her to Vancouver after raping her. While threatening witness not to talk, BOUDRAIS told her that he and DAVE and STEVEN murder on average four to six women every year.
              </p>
             </li>
             <li>
              <p>
               After this attack by BOUDRAIS, witness began to seek outside help, including by contacting the FBI (see Point No.16 below), and as a consequence was nearly killed by MICHAELSON in retaliation. On January 9 of either 2003 or 2004, MICHAELSON broke into the Kitsilano apartment of the witness and broke her ribs, jaw and arm with a baseball bat. MICHAELSON then tied her up, put her in trunk of his car and drove her to the policemen’s “clubhouse” in the Hotel Georgia basement. MICHAELSON then said to the witness, “Now I’ll show you what we do to hookers”, and proceeded to torture her with dental instruments, including on her genitalia, branding her cult-style with an insignia. MICHAELSON then told the witness “We own you now”, and put her to work as a prostitute and lure to attract other women into the game.

                The witness went to Vancouver General Hospital for treatment after her torture, and was treated at the Oak street clinic by a Dr. Jean McLENNAN or McLAREN. A report of her injuries was filed by this doctor with the Vancouver Police Deaprtment that same week.

              <li>
               <p>
                The “hooker game” receives judicial protection from at least one judge, a justice GROBBERMAN, who prior to being a judge served in the provincial Attorney-General’s office under the very man, Ernie QUANTZ, who organized a judicial cover-up on behalf of several prominent pedophiles during the 1980’s. The witness claims seeing other judges and Prime Minister Paul MARTIN at the policemen’s clubhouse in downtown Vancouver during the same evening that MICHAELSON and the PICTON brothers were present, and while drugs and prostitutes were being used. Also in attendance that evening were members of the Canadian Security Intelligence Service (CSIS) and Canadian military officers.

              <li>
               <p>
                After she was attacked by BOUDRAIS, the witness phoned the FBI and asked for an investigation of BOUDRAIS, which occurred in 2005. The FBI investigators were misdirected by MICHAELSON to a false witness who shared the same first name as the witness, and as a result the FBI claimed that there was no evidence against BOUDRAIS. VPD detective Rabinovitch who assisted the FBI also claimed that BOUDRAIS could not be found even though he was circulating openly in Vancouver at the same time. One of the FBI investigators told the witness, however, that BOUDRAIS’s description matched those of the Green River Killer, a serial rapist and murderer in the USA who is still at large.

              <li>
               <p>
                Witness claims that MICHAELSON provides security for foreign diplomats in Vancouver and film industry stars, including Eddie MURPHY, to whom MICHAELSON introduced the witness in 2002. Witness claims that MURPHY raped and sadistically assaulted her, slicing her skin with a knife and leaving permanent scars on her shoulder and neck. (see videotaped interview) Witness states that MURPHY was also responsible for the death of two women during the years 2002-3 in Vancouver : a 21 year old Asian porn actress and a prostitute, both of whom were provided to MURPHY by MICHAELSON, and whose bodies were disposed of by the latter after MURPHY had tortured and raped them, and then overdosed them on drugs.

              <li>
               <p>
                Witness states that she reported the attack on her by MURPHY to a Detective SCOTT with the VPD, along with the claim of MURPHY’s murder of the two women, but when MICHAELSON learned of the complaint he tortured the witness with a knife, carving her neck and face, (see videotaped interview) and threatened to kill her if she pressed charges against MURPHY. Witness then withdrew her complaint. Detective SCOTT subsequently confirmed to the witness that MURPHY was responsible for the murders but they had not enough evidence to prosecute him.

              <li>
               <p>
                Witness believes that MICHAELSON and his associates are “hunting prostitutes of intelligence” and are engaged “in a kind of ethnic cleansing … they target Indians and girls as young as twelve or thirteen.” She believes there is a connection between MICHAELSON’s network and the disappearances of aboriginal women along the Highway of Tears in northern British Columbia .

              <li>

                Witness states that she is kept under constant electronic surveillance by MICHAELSON and his associates, and that her apartment keys have been copied by them to allow their regular access. This is “standard procedure when it comes to women they have hooked into the game”, according to the witness.

               Further background on Eyewitness #1:
              </p>
              <p>
               Annie PARKER states that she was raised in North Bay, Ontario and was used in a child pedophile ring in that city by her father, LEN PARKER, who was a prominent Freemason and newspaper editor who was associated with the NORAD military base in the same city. Annie PARKER says her father raped and tortured her throughout her childhood, and was involved in “mind control research” at the aforementioned NORAD base. He often spoke to her about the so-called “Marionette Syndrome”, whereby a subject is rendered into a mentally docile puppet as the result of extreme torture and trauma. He told the witness that these experiments were being done on children at the NORAD base by American researchers, and that the local pedophile ring existed to provide test subjects to these researchers, as well as child prostitutes to judges and politicians.
              </p>
              <p>
               The witness also claims that, in 1961, when she was four years old, she and an aboriginal girl named Rosemary, who was six, were abducted and jailed in a farmhouse owned by Freemasons where they were serially raped. Rosemary had been abducted from the local Indian reserve. During the rapes, Rosemary tried to help the witness escape from the barn and was caught and killed, and then her skull was displayed in the local Freemason Hall. The witness feels forever indebted to Rosemary for saving her life, and is committed to helping children like her.
              </p>
              <p>
               Eyewitness #2: Caucasian woman, mid fifties, normally domiciled in Powell River, B.C. but presently living in hiding in Alberta. Given name is Dagmar STEPHENS. As a former nurse, human resources social worker and child apprehension court worker in the Powell River and Zeballos area, the witness claims to have personal knowledge of the allegations made herein. Statement made during the week of 2-7 February, 2006, by telephone.

                 Witness states that she was recently forced out of the coastal community of Powell River , B.C. and had her life threatened because of her firsthand knowledge of the role of local RCMP, church officials and doctors in the murder of local women and children, and in the importation of illegal drugs and armaments from overseas.

                 Witness is a former social and court worker who worked in the aboriginal community and among youth between 1982 and 2004. She was a member of the Powell River United Church until forced from its congregation by ministers Dave NEWELL and Cameron REID after she claimed that local church members were importing drugs and engaging in pedophilia. (Note: REID was one of the two church officials who handed Rev. Kevin ANNETT his summary dismissal notice in 1995 after ANNETT began to uncover church crimes among native people in Port Alberni)

                 Witness has firsthand knowledge that Dr. Harvey HENDERSON of the Zeballos health clinic is deliberately addicting aboriginal people to a lethal drug named Oxycotin, a synthetic heroin that induces suicidal behavior. He is doing so at the behest of officials of the state-funded Nuu-Chah-Nulth Tribal Council (NTC) in Port Alberni, BC, in order for the land of his murdered patients to be bought up cheaply by NTC officers. HENDERSON has himself bought much native land on the Ahousat reserve on Flores Island, which he services as a doctor and where he freely distributes the Oxycotin drug. In 2005, all of the suicides among the Ahousats occurred while HENDERSON was working there. HENDERSON lives in Sayward, BC, north of Campbell River.

                 In 2004, witness observed the unloading of drugs and armaments off a black seaplane in the Okeover Inlet near Powell River, under the oversight of Bob PAQUIN, former officer in Quebec secret police and convicted pedophile, Tracy ELKINS, former officer in the South African army, and Colin McCORMACK and Roland LEWIS, local businessmen and associates of the Mayor, coroner and RCMP. Witness claims that these men operate local drug importation with RCMP protection, and deal drugs to local youth and aboriginals. All three are local Freemasons and members of Catholic Knights of Malta, along with Stu ALFGARD, local coroner and pedophile.

                 Witness began to run afoul of this group when, in 1986, her local youth group resolved to confront drug use in Powell River schools, and found immediate resistance to their efforts from the school administration, churches, and social services. Witness then asked parents and local police to support them, which they did; an undercover squad of police began to monitor the activities of aforementioned suspects. But within one year, during 1988, all seven of these undercover policemen died, including head cop Bruce DENNISTON, and their deaths were all ruled as being caused by cancer by coroner and pedophile/drug importer ALFGARD.

                 Witness claims that in 2002, a local Anglican minister named KAREN died suddenly after speaking out publicly about the role of the local Masonic Lodge in suspected drug dealing and pedophilia. Her fellow activist in this exposure, Foursquare Baptist church pastor Gord FRALIC, quickly moved out of town after KAREN’s death and relocated to Kelowna.

                 Witness is presently residing in Alberta in fear of her life, after being directly threatened and attacked by Tracy ELKINS, former South African army officer and principal drug dealer in Powell River area. Witness states that ELKINS assaulted her and drugged her son after witness continued to investigate local drug importing networks. Witness claims that BC politicians and Powell River residents Gordon WILSON and Judy TYABJI were made aware of all of these facts and declined to support her or the anti-drug educational work of her youth group.

                Eyewitness #3: Aboriginal man in his mid forties, resident and maintenance worker employed at the Musqueam Indian Reserve off 51st Avenue on the west side of Vancouver, adjacent to the University of British Columbia. Given name of witness is Leslie GUERIN; domiciled at 3908 KeKait Place , Vancouver, cell phone No.: 778-772-5640. Initial statement made on videotape during the period 9 May – June 6, 2005, with additional statements made during period of 3 December – 18 January, 2006, in Vancouver.
               </p>
               <ol>
                <li>
                 <p>
                  Witness is a member of the Musqueam First Nation in Vancouver who has worked as a maintenance worker and labourer on the Musqueam Reserve since 1990. He is a confidant and associate of many Musqueam officials and politicians. In this position, witness claims to have firsthand and personal knowledge of the allegations he makes herein.
                 </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                 <p>
                  Summary of allegations of witness: The Musqueam Reserve has operated as a mass grave and body dumping site since at least 1989. It is also a center of illegal drug and armaments importing through the adjoining Celtic Shipyards, and is connected to native-run pedophile rings that extend to northern B.C. and southern Alberta . The Musqueam band council leaders, especially the GUERIN, SPARROW and GRANT-JOHN families, are involved in these criminal activities in conjunction with officials of the RCMP, the First Nations Summit and the federal government of Canada. The government provides political and judicial protection for these crimes since the pedophile and body disposal activities by the PICTON brothers and others take place at the behest and in the interest of the government of Canada. The government and police also side with and protect the SPARROW and GUERIN families in their efforts to attack and undermine other families at Musqueam in order to seize their land and other effects, even when these methods result in deaths. One of these methods of terrorizing other Musqueams utilized by the SPARROW-GUERIN-JOHN clique is to seize their children and transport them off the reserve, including into pedophile rings connected with the provincial government’s Ministry of Children and Families. This clique conducts criminal activities on the Musqueam reserve, including drug dealing, strong-arming of dissidents or critics, illegally selling salmon and other fish as well as cigarettes and alcohol, wrongfully evicting band members from their homes and dis-entitling them of their land and DIA payments.
                 </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                 <p>
                  Witness claims that the Musqueam Reserve has functioned as a body-dumping and mass burial site since at least 1989, when he personally observed Willie PICTON deposit and bury large garbage bags in a pit directly opposite the Musqueam First Nation office on the reserve. (See his statement, Exhibit A).Witness claims that he subsequently disinterred the contents of these bags and found numerous bones that upon examination proved to be human, including parts of pelvis, skull and femur. Witness retains samples of these remains in his possession while other samples, including an adult female humerus, are held at Simon Fraser University .
                 </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                 <p>
                  Corollary evidence of this allegation was provided by the witness in the form of a letter (Exhibit B) by Musqueam Housing Officer A. Glenn GUERIN dated 29 October 2004, which states that Dave PICTON, brother of Willie, was employed by the Musqueam band under contract for three of four months during 1989 or 1990, to provide land fill for a street extension.
                 </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                 <p>
                  Witness states that the activities of Willie and Dave PICTON on the Musqueam reserve were fully known and approved by all the band councilors at Musqueam, including Wendy SPARROW, aka Wendy GRANT-JOHN, federal Department of Indian Affairs official and wife of accused pedophile-drug dealer Chief Ed JOHN, who is domiciled at the Musqueam reserve and owns adjoining Celtic Shipyards.
                 </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                 <p>
                  Witness reported the activities of the PICTON brothers at Musqueam in 2002 to the Vancouver police (VPD), after the “ Piggy Palace ” story was reported in local media. But Ed and Leona SPARROW stopped the subsequent police investigation of the remains deposited at Musqueam by the PICTONs after arranging a cover-up with VPD Constable Scott ROLLINS (Badge #2028) and officer Jodine KELLER. Leona SPARROW was also seen attending parties at the PICTON’s “Pig Farm” in company of RCMP.
                 </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                 <p>
                  The following media were contacted by the witness and informed of the remains deposited by the PICTONs at Musqueam, but declined from investigating: Mike CLARKE, City TV, Kelly RYAN, CBC radio, Gerald BELLETT, Vancouver Sun, and Karen Urguhart, The Province. Also notified by witness was William MACDONALD, Office of the Police Complaints Commissioner in Vancouver.

                </li>
                <li>
                 <p>
                  After more than two years, on November 3, 2004, witness and fellow Musqueam band member Jim KEW made a formal complaint to the VPD Complaints Commissioner about the refusal of police to investigate either the burial site at Musqueam or the apparent role of the PICTONs in burying the remains. (Exhibit C) No response has been received from the VPD at any level.

                <li>
                 <p>
                  Witness reports seeing Uzi guns and other automatic weapons being unloaded from containers at Celtic Shipyards, 3150 Celtic Avenue, in the summer of 1988, under the supervision of SPARROW relatives Joe BECKER and Wayne GUERIN. BECKER spoke to witness at the time and referred to the importing of drugs through the same shipyard in vessels using false bow fronts. Witness worked as a security guard at Celtic Shipyards between 1995 and 2001, and observed similar unloading of guns and drugs during these years.
                 </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                 <p>
                  Witness claims that same Joe BECKER works as an enforcer for Musqueam band officials, including the GUERIN and SPARROW families, along with Walter Dunstan CAMPBELL, whom witness says was arrested with the body of a dead woman in his car trunk, but was quickly released. CAMPBELL also operates protection system for child porn film operation at Carrall and Hastings streets, which in 2004-5 operated behind the front of a bank.
                 </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                 <p>
                  Witness claims that other Musqueam officials involved in this child porn film operation include Robert GUERIN, Andrew CHARLES, Frank and Jason MALLOWAY (see Point No. 12 in Testimony #1, re: Stella MALLOWAY), a non-native drug dealer named “DA SILVA”, and Chief Ed JOHN. CHARLES, JOHN and CAMPBELL, along with Ed SPARROW, were responsible for the gang rape and beating of Marlon LOUIE, a band member, during 2003 after LOUIE had discovered a “hit list” of the Musqueam “goon squad” headed by Joe BECKER and Walter Dunstan CAMPBELL.
                 </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                 <p>
                  BECKER and CAMPBELL head this enforcement “goon squad” on Musqueam reserve that includes former Canucks hockey player Gino OJICK, who owns Musqueam Golf Course Café. Witness claims that OJICK attempted to kill him with poison in 2002 after witness went to the VPD with allegation about PICTON brothers’ activities at Musqueam.
                 </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                 <p>
                  Witness claims that the main security officer for the Musqueam reserve, ex-Edmonton policeman David LAVALLEE, is part of this enforcement/goon squad. LAVALLEE left the Edmonton police under a cloud of suspicion concerning his involvement in the rape and disappearance of local women and children.
                 </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                 <p>
                  Witness claims that the members of this enforcement/goon squad are responsible for the deaths of numerous Musqueam band members, often through staging fake car accidents or executing people with drug overdoses. These deaths occur in order to seize the homes and land of the murdered persons, and secure the power of the SPARROW-GUERIN clique. One such murder occurred in 2000 when a young native woman named GANARJEE was evicted for not being able to pay her property taxes, which had been wrongfully increased by the GUERIN-SPARROW clique. She then became homeless on Hastings street, was addicted to drugs by CAMPBELL, and then “overdosed” and died. The SPARROW family then received her home and property.
                 </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                 <p>
                  Witness claims that GANARJEE’s property was seized by lawyer Marvin STORROW of Blake, Cassells and Graydon law firm in Vancouver, who works closely with the SPARROW clique and their relative Chief Ed JOHN. (Note: STORROW represented JOHN in a 2002 BC Supreme Court lawsuit that silenced JOHN’s critics and imposed a gag order on any media reporting of the accusations of criminal actions by JOHN.) STORROW has a long history of involvement with the Musqueam band and the SPARROW family (see Exhibit D) and has strong ties with the federal Liberal party. Leona SPARROW who is associated with the PICTONs and concealed their activity at Musqueam (see Point No. 6) has worked for STORROW’s law firm.

                   Other lawyers and firms associated with the SPARROW clique and their activities include Lou HARVEY and Smithe-Radcliffe law firm. HARVEY is an old associate of STORROW and has helped to steal and illegally transfer Musqueam land into the control of Squamish politicians working for the federal government.

                  <p>
                   Witness claims that the SPARROW clique evade federal laws limiting the commercial sale of salmon by aboriginal people, and completely monopolize an illegal black market in fish operating out of the Musqueam reserve. Wendy GRANT-JOHN (a former SPARROW) operates her own fish store, Longhouse Seafoods in the Dunbar region of Vancouver, which illegally sells sockeye and other salmon. The enforcement/goon squad silence band criticism of these acts.

                 <li>
                  <p>
                   Similarly, in a written statement dated December 26, 2005, the witness claims “For the record, all the elders whom have died, it’s Wendy’s family (who) lives in each and every home that comes from another unexpected death … they (the SPARROW clique) have a group of people monitoring each band member and so they wait for a window of opportunity to strike. They pick targets in the community and slowly tear them apart – deliberately destroy lives.”

                 Witness #4: Retired aboriginal man in his late fifties, a band councilor and member of the Musqueam band and a friend of Witness #3. Given name is Arthur STOGAN sr, he is a direct descendent of the hereditary chiefs of the Musqueam people. Resides on the reserve, phone 604-263-6295. His lifelong residence at Musqueam and involvement as a band councilor gives him a personal knowledge of the facts he alleges herein. Initial statement made on videotape during the period 9 May – June 6, 2005, with additional statements made during period of 3 December – 18 January, 2006, in Vancouver.

                   Witness affirms all that witness #3 alleges in his statement, adding that he and his extended family are being targeted by the SPARROW clique for their opposition to the crimes described. In particular, witness claims that his grandchildren have been deliberately seized by Ministry of Children and Family (MCF) officials and sent into foster homes operated by known pedophiles in order to silence the witness and force him into conformity. (See Exhibit F) (Note: MCF was run by SPARROW relative and Musqueam enforcer Ed JOHN during 2000-2001 when he served in the provincial government).

                  <p>
                   Witness claims that after the death of his father, Vincent STOGAN, the hereditary chief of the Musqueam, in 2000, attacks against he and his family were made by the SPARROW clique on the reserve, especially after the witness began to speak out against that clique’s corrupt and nepotistic practices. These attacks culminated in February of 2004, when all fourteen of the witnesses’ grandchildren were seized by Xyolhemeylh, the Child Protection Society of the Sto”lo First Nation near Chilliwack . Witness was denied any visiting rights, even though one of his grand daughters was placed in the home of a convicted pedophile by Xyolhemeylh worker Loretta ROSZA, who also falsified reports and made false claims about the children. ROSZA is associated with Wendy GRANT-JOHN (SPARROW) through the Sumas First Nation. Both the Chilliwack and Mission detachments of the RCMP refused to investigate complaints by the witness regarding these actions. (Exhibit F)

                   Witness states that another reason for this attack on he and his family is his discovery of evidence that the present SPARROW clique and their relatives cooperated with the federal government in destroying traditional records and histories of the Musqueam and Coast Salish people during the 1970’s, as part of the effort to ethnically cleanse west coast aboriginal people and steal their land. A letter from the Department of Indian Affairs dated September 22, 1972 states that individual records of native people in B.C. were to be destroyed under the scrutiny of Chief Clarence Joe, a SPARROW relative. (see Exhibit G)These records included evidence of original land ownership and genealogy.

                   Witness states that there is a direct link between criminal and pedophile networks involving aboriginal politicians in both Musqueam and Cowichan nations because of traditional kinship ties across Georgia Straight. Witness claims that Joe BECKER, Delbert GUERIN and Andrew CHARLES are linked to Cowichan chiefs who are heavily involved in the drug trade, illegal fishing and pedophile rings operating out of Nanaimo, centred around the HARRIS family of the Chemainus First Nation.

                   In December of 2005, the witness compiled these allegations into a letter to Amnesty International, and sent with this letter forensic samples of the alleged human remains unearthed by Witness #3 at the Musqueam burial site visited by the PICTONs. This letter and package were returned to the witness unopened. Both witness and Witness #3 live in daily fear for their lives.
