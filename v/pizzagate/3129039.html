            FBI's Secret Spyware Tracks Down Teen Who Made Bomb Threats

            In an affidavit seeking a search warrant to use the software, filed last month in U.S. District Court in the Western District of Washington, FBI agent Norman Sanders describes the software as a "computer and internet protocol address verifier," or CIPAV.
The full capabilities of the FBI's "computer and internet protocol address verifier" are closely guarded secrets, but here's some of the data the malware collects from a computer immediately after infiltrating it, according to a bureau affidavit acquired by Wired News.

            Eric Eoin Marques (28), dressed in a grey tracksuit top and jeans, appeared before the President of the High Court Mr Justice Nicholas Kearns. 
The alleged charges relate to images on a large number of websites described as being extremely violent, graphic and depicting the rape and torture of pre-pubescent children.

            Visit the Wrong Website, and the FBI Could End Up in Your Computer
05/08/2014
           </p>
           <p>
            On August 1, 2013, some savvy Tor users began noticing that the Freedom Hosting sites were serving a hidden “iframe”—a kind of website within a website. The iframe contained Javascript code that used a Firefox vulnerability to execute instructions on the victim’s computer. The code specifically targeted the version of Firefox used in the Tor Browser Bundle—the easiest way to use Tor.
The FBI’s use of malware is not new. The bureau calls the method an NIT, for “network investigative technique,” and the FBI has been using it since at least 2002 in cases ranging from computer hacking to bomb threats, child porn to extortion. Depending on the deployment, an NIT can be a bulky full-featured backdoor program that gives the government access to your files, location, web history and webcam for a month at a time, or a slim, fleeting wisp of code that sends the FBI your computer’s name and address, and then evaporates.
What’s changed is the way the FBI uses its malware capability, deploying it as a driftnet instead of a fishing line. And the shift is a direct response to Tor, the powerful anonymity system endorsed by Edward Snowden and the State Department alike.

            In early 2015, the Federal Bureau of Investigation ran a dark web child pornography site from its own servers for 13 days, and hacked over a thousand computers that visited it.

             FBI ran website sharing thousands of child porn images 
Published 5:36 PM EST Jan 21, 2016
            </p>
            <p>
             WASHINGTON — For nearly two weeks last year, the FBI operated what it described as one of the Internet’s largest child pornography websites, allowing users to download thousands of illicit images and videos from a government site in the Washington suburbs.
At the time, the site had more than 215,000 registered users and included links to more than 23,000 sexually explicit images and videos of children, including more than 9,000 files that users could download directly from the FBI.
Officials acknowledged those risks, but said they had no other way to identify the people accessing the sites.
The FBI was first known to have operated a child porn site in 2012, when agents seized control of three sites from their operator in Nebraska
The next year, the FBI took control of a dark web site known as Freedom Hosting
In each case, the FBI injected the site with malware to crack Tor’s anonymity.

             "one defense team has made the extraordinary step of arguing to have their client's case thrown out completely. Their main argument is that the FBI, in briefly running the child pornography site from its own servers in Virginia, itself distributed an "untold" amount of illegal material."

             This is how the government is catching people who use child porn sites

             The issue, said Ghappour, the law professor, is not the use of the malware per se, but “whether hacking warrants are written narrowly enough to guarantee that only those culpable set the trigger [to launch the NIT], and consequently get hacked,” he said. “Given the scale of these operations, the smallest mistake could result in hundreds, if not thousands, of privacy violations.”

             FBI's NIT Hit 8,000 Computers In 120 Countries... As Did The Child Porn It Was Redistributing
Tue, Nov 29th 2016
            </p>
            <p>
             "Your Honor, starting with Michaud, and what we know now is there was no discussion of trying to limit the distribution. There were no protocols for these agents for handling or limiting the distribution of child pornography. And the scale of the distribution now went out to at least 120 countries, at least 1 million images. And it is absolutely mind boggling, we have not seen something like this."
"We have never, in our nation's history as far as I can tell, seen a warrant so utterly sweeping. 100,000 potential targets. Something like 8700 IP addresses captured. At least 1152 open investigations. And now oddly enough only, about 214 arrests."
"What's even more disturbing, even if they disagree about the efficacy of some of those methods, we now know from Agent Alfin's recent testimony which we cited, there was absolutely no discussion at the Department of Justice or the FBI about protocols in terms of handling this stuff or whether these methods of limiting, at least limiting the most egregious distribution were viable. Nobody cared."

             Mozilla Asks Court To Force FBI To Turn Over Information On Hacking Tool It Used In Child Porn Case
May 12th 2016
            </p>
            <p>
             With the Tor browser being built on the Firefox framework, any exploit of Tor could affect vanilla Firefox users. Not only that, but the FBI is apparently sitting on another Firefox vulnerability it used in a previous investigation to unmask Tor users. (This refers to the FBI's 2012 child porn sting, which also used a NIT to obtain information about visitors to a seized website.) The filing notes the FBI has been less than helpful when approached for info about this Firefox/Tor-exploiting NIT.
Mozilla has contacted the Government about this matter but the Government recently refused to provide any information regarding the vulnerability used, including whether it affects Mozilla’s products. Accordingly, Mozilla requests that the Court modify its order to take into account how such disclosure may affect Mozilla and the safety of the several hundred million users who rely on Firefox.

             Unsealed Court Docs Show FBI Used Malware Like ‘A Grenade’
Nov 7 2016
"That is, while the warrant authorized hacking with a scalpel, the FBI delivered their malware to TorMail users with a grenade," Christopher Soghoian, principal technologist at the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), told Motherboard in an email."

             "For more than a decade, a persistent myth in Washington DC, fueled by several counterterrorism experts, has been that it is possible to hide a communications trail by sharing an email inbox, and instead saving emails in a “draft” folder. This technique has been used by Khaled Sheikh Mohammed, Richard Reid (the shoe bomber), the 2004 Madrid train bombers, terrorists in Germany, as well as some domestic “eco-terrorists.” This technique has appeared in federal court documents as early as 2003, and was described in a law journal article written by a DOJ official in 2004. It is hardly a state secret."

            Anyone here good at Latin? Lincoln, Nebraska's Momo pizza menu has a campagnola (peasant, rustic woman) for 16.99 and below it just describes Lorem Ipsum, which from what I gather is possibly two of some kind of code. Lorem ipsum is also featured on Joomla!, Google Docs, and WordPress web content managers. Microsoft Word (type '=lorem()' or '=rand()' and hit enter)[9] and BBEdit (Edit--&gt;Insert--&gt;Lorem ipsum) have a lorem ipsum generation feature. Several LaTeX packages produce Lorem-ipsum-style text. All the other items on the menu were normal until I got there.

              It sounded like a rough definition of pig latin to me. I still can't understand why it would be in place of a description of the two items on the bottom of the menu, or why it included the brief history of Lorem Ipsum, unless just as an Italian invention because it is an Italian restaurant. Want to see old website for Lincoln, Nebraska and Tallahassee MoMo's. Mellow Mushroom Pizza website is full of Pedo signs, and that is a fair size chain.
