<blockquote>
<p>Two wealthy Ecuadorian brothers who were principals in DaVinci Biosciences and DV Biologics, the California companies fined and ordered to shut down for illegally trafficking world-wide in aborted baby parts it obtained from Planned Parenthood, were arrested by ICE on February 13, 2019.</p>
<p>According to Law.com:</p>
<p>U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement arrested Roberto and William Isaías on Feb. 13. ICE representative Nestor Yglesias said the brothers were “unlawfully present” in the U.S., and have been “transferred to ICE’s Enforcement and Removal Operations” for deportation proceedings following their arrest. Yglesias added the pair is “in agency custody pending removal proceedings.”</p>
<p>The arrest of Roberto and William Isaias was gratifying to Operation Rescue, which <a href="https://archive.li/jR6f0#selection-483.0-497.16">published an investigative research report on October 27, 2016</a> – just days before the Presidential Election that put Donald J. Trump in office – that detailed their crimes in Ecuador, dubious dealings with the Obama administration, their business with Planned Parenthood and the aborted baby body parts trade.</p>
<p>“We understood that this family was in the U.S. under suspicious circumstances, and that they had committed crimes in Ecuador and Southern California,” said Operation Rescue President Troy Newman.  “We had hoped that one day they would return to Ecuador so that justice could be done, but their arrests still took us by surprise.”</p>
<p>In 2012, Roberto and William Isaias were sentenced in abstentia to eight years in prison for running their Ecuadorian bank into the ground then presenting false balance sheets to profit from bailout funds, wiping out the life savings of thousands of families.  Ecuador says the Isaias family cost the impoverished country a total of $661.5 million.</p>
<p><strong>The Isaias family began dumping large amounts of campaign contributions into American political campaigns, including $90,000 to Obama’s 2012 re-election campaign.  As a result, after reaching out to then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton for asylum, the Isaias’ were granted expedited immigration into the U.S.  Clinton’s State Department then rebuffed attempts by Ecuador to extradite them to face justice.</strong></p>
<p>Once in America, the Isaias family owned and operated DaVinci Biosciences and DV Biologics, companies that contracted exclusively with Planned Parenthood of Orange County to receive aborted baby tissues and organs, which they trafficked overseas.</p>
<p>Roberto and William Isaias’ nephew, Estafano Isaias, Jr., who was involved in profit-taking from the two biotech companies, also owned a business that sold pornography online.</p>
<p>After the release of the Center for Medical Progress’ undercover video exposés in 2015, Orange County District Attorney Tony Rackauckas sued the companies for their illegal body parts trade, and in 2017 reached a settlement agreement that fined them $7.8 million, and ordered their businesses to close.</p>
<p>The arrest of Roberto and William Isaias was gratifying to Operation Rescue, which published an investigative research report on October 27, 2016 – just days before the Presidential Election that put Donald J. Trump in office – that detailed their crimes in Ecuador, dubious dealings with the Obama administration, their business with Planned Parenthood and the aborted baby body parts trade.</p>
<p>“We have mentioned the Isaias brothers repeatedly in articles that we have published over the past couple of years, including the corruption in the Obama Administration, which allowed them to come to our country where they committed further crimes,” said Newman.  “We hoped that someone would take notice.”</p>
<p>Just last month, Operation Rescue published an exposé that delved into the market for aborted baby body parts.  It revealed that the DaVinci biotech companies sent tissues and organs obtained from Planned Parenthood around the world to businesses that were working to develop anti-aging drugs for the wealthy.</p>
<p>“The Isaias’ are bad people, and we are very relieved that they will soon be back in Ecuador to serve their sentences and hopefully return the money they took from the people they bilked,” said Newman.  “And we are especially glad that they are out of the baby parts trade permanently.”</p>

            Folks, if you want to dig further into DaVinci BioSciences and the nefarious shit they were up to with fetal organ trafficking, they used to talk all about it on
            <a href="https://archive.is/hlLIO">
             their website
            </a>
            . It's scrubbed, now, but we can dig around for cached and archived pages.
           </p>
           <p>
            I found

             this one

            , which notes their areas of research. Two of the top are "neurological diseases" (which Hillary has) and "cardiovascular diseases" (which Bill has). What a coincidence.

            I was digging around on archive.today for mentions of "DaVinci BioSciences" and came across a very interesting article on a pro-Assange blog called Jimmy's Llama about the Guardian's Assange smear campaign, which discusses a probable CIA operative named Hollihan and mentions connections to the Isaias family:

              WikiLeaks cable
             </a>
             from former Ambassador Kristie A. Kenney sums up the brothers nicely,
            </p>
            <blockquote>
             <p>
              “William and Roberto Isaias, former chiefs of Filanbanco bank and among Ecuador’s richest men, fled Ecuador in 1999 after absconding with over $100 million in government bailout funds. They used their ill-gotten wealth to buy safe passage from Ecuador and later pressured prosecutors to reduce criminal charges against them. Similar pressure tactics resulted in GoE-prepared extradition packages that were insubstantial and non-actionable by the Department of Justice. Proof of their financial shenanigans was sufficient, however, to permit the State Department to revoke their visas on money-laundering charges in 2003.”
             </p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>
             The cable provides perhaps the most detailed summary I’ve come across with regards to the brothers, their businesses, and their alleged crimes.  As of today, they still reside in the United States after paying for safe passage out of Ecuador.  There’s more to the story, however. A New York Times
             <a href="https://archive.li/o/lyOMX/https:/www.nytimes.com/2014/03/12/world/americas/wanted-by-ecuador-2-brothers-make-mark-in-us-campaigns.html">
              article
             </a>
             reported that family members of the Isaias’ donated an obscene amount of money to U.S. political candidates including President Obama’s campaign, after which the Obama administration rejected Ecuador’s extradition request for the brothers.
            </p>
            <p>
             The National Review also ran a
             <a href="https://archive.li/o/lyOMX/https:/www.nationalreview.com/2014/12/hillary-and-immigration-bribe-ian-tuttle/">
              story
             </a>
             in 2014, detailing how a relative of the Isaias’ was able to essentially bribe her way into the United States.  They reported,
            </p>
            <blockquote>
             <p>
              “’The woman, Estefanía Isaías, had been barred from coming to the United States after being caught fraudulently obtaining visas for her maids,’ the Times reports. ‘But the ban was lifted at the request of the State Department under former Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton so that Ms. Isaías could work for an Obama fund-raiser with close ties to the administration.’
That fundraiser, Alfredo J. Balsera, head of Balsera Communications in Miami, is backing Clinton in 2016.”
             </p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>
             So that’s fun.  And remember that story about Planned Parenthood selling baby parts?  The Isaias family was allegedly involved in that, too,
             <a href="https://archive.li/o/lyOMX/https:/www.ocweekly.com/abortion-foes-connect-hillary-clinton-to-orange-countys-fetal-tissue-defendants-7640423/">

            <blockquote>
             <p>
              “…the Isaias companies had no problem procuring on a regular basis tissue of aborted babies, including hearts, lungs, kidneys, brains, intestines, skeletal muscle and bones, from Planned Parenthood…U.S. companies and institutions were heavily price-gouged, while foreign entities got deep discounts…The Isaias baby parts businesses shipped the remains of aborted American babies all over the world.”

             That woman’s name was Lara Prychodko and she was married to David Schlachet, a Big Pharma executive and long-time George Soros aide.  It appears he has numerous ties directly to Israel.

             Sound familiar?  We now have two stem cell research companies directly tied to Hillary both with shady circumstances surrounding them. I find this odd and very unlikely to be a coincidence.  I am still on the hunt and will update if any other connections are found. Just wanted to go ahead and get this out there

                Interesting, jangles! I never saw this submission...Falcon must have deleted it. I always wondered what the hell those penguin glands were being imported for. Why penguins? Well -- sensitivity to light would certainly make sense.
               </p>
               <p>
                And now that you mention this, it makes me wonder about the big push to outlaw incandescent light bulbs awhile back. First we were supposed to replace everything with fluorescent. Then LED. Remember how that was forced on folks?
               </p>
               <p>
                I can't stand the things, because I've got a CLOCK gene mutation that makes me sensitive to blue light. I have to wear blue-light blocking shades to watch TV at night, otherwise it will reset my Circadian clock and I won't be able to sleep. I'd been struggling with pretty terrible insomnia for over a decade before I figured this out, and of course the only treatment the docs could offer was Ambien. No thanks! Recently, they discovered the glymphatic system, which links chronic loss of deep sleep with accumulation of metabolic waste in the brain and long term may be the ultimate cause of various forms of dementia as well as depression.
               </p>
               <p>
                Kinda have to wonder, now, if they knew about the effect of blue light on sleep and deliberately increased people's exposure levels through the lightbulb push and ever more brilliant phone and television screens as part of an overarching population control agenda. I can't shake the idea that this is one of the main drivers behind the pedophelia and transgender normalization, as well -- to stop the plebes from having kids.

               Where else are these guys going to get their stem cells other than PP. While I have still been unable to directly tie the two companies together other than Hillary it has to be similar circumstances. This brings in all the players... Hillary, Obama, Huma, Soros, and Israel. Holy shit!

               That would be great, jangles. Check out my other comments in this thread (just added). They appear to still be in business via this Dr. Gonzales guy and this Panamanian company Regeneration Worldwide. You think the guy is stooge? Or part of the Isaias scheme to cure Hillary's neurological disorders?

            <p>
             Andres Isaías, Luis Isaías, and Estefano Isaías admitted that they’ve been illegally selling fetal tissue for massive profit through their Planned Parenthood-affiliated businesses DV Biologics and DaVinci Biosciences.
            </p>
            <p>
             The brothers will pay almost $8 million as they settled a lawsuit the Orange County, California District Attorney launched against them in October 2016.
            </p>
            <p>
             The OCDA launched its investigation against the companies after a complaint was filed against the businesses by the Center for Medical Progress, the organization that produced the undercover video that shows Dr. Jennifer Russo, medical director for Planned Parenthood of Orange and San Bernadino counties, stating her efforts to harvest “intact” specimens from the abortions she performs.
In the video, Russo says that Planned Parenthood works with a local biotech company called “DaVinci” to supply fetal body parts.

             Wanted by Ecuador, 2 Brothers Make Mark in U.S. Campaigns
            </a>
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             The tug of war over the Isaias brothers, sentenced in an embezzlement case, is part of a broader battle between Ecuador and the White House over international fugitives, including two other men the Obama administration would like to get its hands on: Julian Assange, the founder of WikiLeaks, and Edward J. Snowden, the former intelligence contractor.
            </p>
            <p>
             For close to two years, Ecuador has sheltered Mr. Assange in its embassy in London, arguing that he risks persecution and possibly the death penalty if he ultimately faces trial in the United States for revealing American secrets. Similarly, the White House fumed when Ecuador expressed an openness to granting asylum to Mr. Snowden as well.

             Roberto’s wife; their children, daughter-in-law and nephews; and a few employees have donated at least $320,000 to American political campaigns since 2010, (
             <em>
              written 2014

             the men sought refuge in Miami, where the family owned Republic National Bank, known for financing Cuban-American businesses. It was sold in 1999, making the brothers a fortune as the crisis exploded in Ecuador.
            </p>
            <p>
             In 2005, Kristie A. Kenney, then the American ambassador to Ecuador, wrote a scathing cable to Washington accusing the brothers of financing a $2 million bribe to get Ecuador’s attorney general to drop the case. She acknowledged then that the government of Ecuador offered feeble documentation to back up its extradition request, but she attributed that to pressure from the Isaias family, which owned 27 radio stations, three newspapers and a sugar production company.
            </p>
            <p>
             Some American officials tried to revoke the brothers’ visas over money-laundering accusations, she wrote in the cable, released by WikiLeaks.
            </p>
            <p>
             The relative anonymity the family once enjoyed in the United States ended in late January when an NBC station reported that Mr. Menendez was under federal investigation for having received donations from the family and having written on its behalf to the Department of Homeland Security.

            <p>
             Two weeks later, CNN announced the cancellation of CNN Latino, a short-lived partnership with Roberto Isaias’ son Luis that distributed Spanish-language programming in five cities, four of them on stations Mr. Isaias said he gave his son. CNN said the decision had nothing to do with the Menendez issue.
Mr. Menendez’s office acknowledged sending at least five letters to the Department of Homeland Security for the brothers and other relatives with immigration problems, but described them as among thousands of such letters he has sent. His office said there was no indication that the issue was being investigated by the F.B.I., and the agency declined to comment. Mr. Menendez received $13,000 from the family, and Mr. Isaias’s wife also donated $30,000 to a senatorial campaign committee Mr. Menendez led in 2010.
