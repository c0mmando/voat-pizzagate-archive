            By the way, this "citizen investigator" is owner, publisher and editor in chief of his own newspaper and part owner of another newspaper, so he's not typical of "citizen investigators."  In fact, you can call him a journalist or a mini-media mogul.
           </p>
           <p>
            Frank Report is definitely the go to guy for details on NXVIM, as he's been on this beat for a long time and many ex members have spoken to him.  But there's some questions about this guy. He's scheduled to go on trial in a month or two on 19 counts that include a conspiracy “to defraud the United States and certain members of the public, to obstruct the function of the Internal Revenue Service, wire fraud and wire fraud conspiracy, money laundering, and corrupt interference with the administration of the IRS laws.”

             There are many here who have journalism training and experience AWS, including me. I think your grasp of the "typical" citizen investigator is limited by your own arrogant assumptions.

                Oh true! I do remember that being discussed re: Rainbow Garden.
               </p>
               <p>
                So NXIVM is pretty well rooted in Europe abroad, Middle-East included. Also very much a part of their network, is Mexico(their property and/or business holdings there and anyone affording protection/cover for their operations,etc).
               </p>
               <p>
                Through the NTC and NXIVM, we can also establish a Canadian NXIVM connection, which reveals more common ground with Scientology in Canada and Ireland/London/Europe/etc...
               </p>
               <p>
                Reminder again, that George Soros(Ayco, Goldman Sachs)~ is a neighbor of~ NXIVM in Albany...
               </p>
               <p>
                Quite a network they have indeed.

              Not at all to take away from how early Frank started reporting on NXIVM, but, I'm referring to when Keith Raniere was arrested (~March 25, 2018) 'breaking' the cover of NXIVM and putting them in the broader public light - it finally got the attention it needed and I for one hadn't even heard of them until the arrest was reported.
             </p>
             <p>
              Things like this usually do start with just one or a few people speaking up - thanks to all involved, we're now seeing how central NXIVM, Scientology and other related/connected cults are, as they're ones which are actually connected up to the politicians(et al) that we've long known/suspected to be corrupt.

               The NY Times did a story in Oct 2017 based on their original reporting that "broke" the NXIVM story wide open.  The state and federal investigations started because of that Times story.
              </p>
              <p>
               The Frank Report is mentioned in the article.  I would guess that is where the Times got onto the story and did it's own original reporting and interviews with ex-members.
              </p>
              <p>
               It's a very good read.

               I mentioned looking at June on the Frank Report, because he put out a lot of stories then.

               I think you're pretty off on this. NXIVM is not going to end up being really connected to anything.   Most of the members of NXIVM didn't even know this was going on.  They learned about this secret society from the Frank Report
              </p>
              <blockquote>
               <p>
                A few days later, many of Mr. Raniere’s followers learned of the secret society from a website run by a Buffalo-area businessman, Frank R. Parlato Jr.
               </p>
              </blockquote>
              <p>
               Even women who were in that "sorority" didn't know that branding was going on.  That was like an even more secret, deeper inner circle.
              </p>
              <blockquote>
               <p>
                In early June, Mr. Parlato published the first in a torrent of salacious posts under the headline, “Branded Slaves and Master Raniere.”
               </p>
               <p>
                A Nxivm follower, Soukaina Mehdaoui, said she reached out to Mr. Raniere after reading the post. Ms. Mehdaoui, 25, was a newcomer to Nxivm, but the two had grown close.
               </p>
               <p>
                She said Mr. Raniere told her the secret sorority began after three women offered damaging collateral to seal lifetime vows of obedience to him.
               </p>
               <p>
                While Ms. Mehdaoui had joined the sorority, the women in her circle were not branded. She was appalled.
               </p>
               <p>
                ADVERTISEMENT
               </p>
               <p>
                “There are things I didn’t know that I didn’t sign up for, and I’m not even hearing about it from you,” she texted Mr. Raniere.
               </p>
               <p>
                Mr. Raniere texted back about his initials and the brand.
               </p>
               <p>
                By then, panic was spreading inside Nxivm. Slaves were ordered to delete encrypted messages between them and erase Google documents, two women said. To those considering breaking away, it was not clear whom they could trust and who were Nxivm loyalists.
               </p>
               <p>
                Late one night, Ms. Mehdaoui met secretly with another Nxivm member. They took out their cellphones to show they were not recording the conversation.
               </p>
               <p>
                Both decided to leave Nxivm, despite concerns that the group would retaliate by releasing their “collateral” or suing them.

                Oh, I seem to have forgotten who I'm talking to... forgot you're one of the fuckwits who challenges the subjects that deliver the most. Should have blocked you ages ago so I don't have to read your shit or see you in my notifs.

               <p>
                Your routine is stale as fuck. Nobody's taking away from Frank's reporting, yet you're trying to use it as a means to say that NXIVM is a nothing burger and otherwise antagonize me for looking into it after Ranier was arrested.
               </p>
               <p>
                Like I said to the Scientologist shill who tried to dissuade investigation, you can also go ahead and fuck off. For your sake, I hope you're just a dumb troll and not deliberately shilling with the Scientologists and those who come off the assembly line of other shillfarms, because I'm not even remotely done. Also, again like I said to the Scientologist shill, I'm now going to block you so I don't have to see your shit anymore - take that as rude or a personal victory for yourself, all you like.
