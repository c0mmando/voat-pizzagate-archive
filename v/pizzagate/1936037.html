             Actually that's not true. George didn't uncover the Awan Brothers story but he went down to DC and reported to several members of Congress. Legally that's very significant.
            </p>
            <p>
             Why? Because as soon as a Congressman is notified of a possible case of Treason on the part of Deep Wasserman Shitz they MUST ACT. If they don't they're guilty of Misprision of Treason.
            </p>
            <p>
             That's why Congressman
             <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louie_Gohmert">
              Louie Gohmert
             </a>
             read the Awan Brothers into the public record in Congress. Gohmert IS A FORMER JUDGE!
            </p>
            <p>
             He knows the legal jeopardy he's in if he doesn't act.

             Good. He may still be pulling punch after all who knows. For now the sheer amount of flak George Webb is taking is clear proof he's legitimate and most of what he says is legitimate.
            </p>
            <p>
             Btw that's a good way to shut down a shill like

              @V____Z
             </a>
             . They attack George and call him insane and say he lacks credibility and nothing he says can be proven etc etc.
            </p>
            <p>
             Then I ask them "Why are you so adamant to tell me that then? Why do you care? If he's insane and spends all day charging at wind mills then who cares what he thinks."
            </p>

             They never respond or if they do it's to change the subject.

             Well that pretty much confirms your shillage doesn't. It's dripping with dishonesty.
            </p>
            <p>
             A bomb threat isn't the same as someone telling you there's a bomb somewhere and you call to warn people. If we used your definition the Coast Guard would get the call about a dirty bomb and then not pass the message on because they need to take a blood sample first.
            </p>
            <p>
             One is a threat and the other is what any sane and normally adjusted person would do.
            </p>
            <p>
             If you see something say something.

             You sold your soul to the devil. God is always watching.

              I couldn't wait to find out what you thought about all this! Ok so what do you think? Who's deep state? George? I was thinking that Steele was on the same side as Grorge cuz he's trying to help him. What do you think of the brother? Jason? Trish? This is all just getting crazier! I could watch DeFango for hours. He's a crack up lol.

               George is simply an actor/salesman playing the hero for whom all the women swoon, he's got training in mind control/persuasion and zero morals, so his videos are a brainwashing operation on the public. Trish is a flat out idiot who wanted to make a name for herself, and she has sold out the truth and her fellow citizens to ride their coattails. Jason is gross, and was probably hired by Mossad to control George and tighten up the operation, he is the one who got them into real stardom, promoting George's big smile and endless stream of bullshit on every major channel. They also hired a team of trolls to look like fans online, and to upvote and downvote, and troll real truthers if they ever question this act. If one truly understands what is taking place here, they should be furious. There is a reason Webb needs to stay drunk. He can't face that his whole life is a lie. There is a reason he commented that he hopes Mossad will come "save" him.  He knew he was going to be used to pull a false flag, like the one he just did, which as many are saying, was meant to kill the truth movement, and that's why he knew he was going to need saving...... Indeed RD Steele has already said he is going to save George, RD Steele supports George based on the flimsiest of reasons, and false pretenses, which i cover

                The real danger right now is Dave. Keep an eye on that guy. He is making big moves right now, and frankly, he's starting to sound a lot like George. (Whether or not they're the same person--whatever). I'm not 100% convinced either way on the guy, but he needs some serious scrutiny if he's gonna be stepping up like he is.

                 I agree he is dangerous, and that George is too. I think G will be swept away to Israel soon. Dave has ties to the US government and has no problem with spying on innocent Americans, he helped the govt to do this. He's also got nothing but bitter in his spirit, he is mean to the core. Can't trust that. George is absolutely nuts, and should be locked up.
                </p>
                <p>
                 Dave goes from trying to hurt George, saying fuck him , and lashing out at this children, then in the next video, he is trying to gather forces to save George and blame everything on Trish and Jason. What a nutjob. But obviously, by the size of George's following, one does not have to be sane or truthful, only to have a salesman-like smile and demeanor, to fool thousands.

                 That NYT headline: "conspiracy theorists shut down a port" was worth a lot of money to those who are hurt by citizen investigators. That would include people with a lot of money like the Dems/Soros. Also it is well known that Mossad is proficient in pulling false flags. George once said "I hope Mossad comes and saves me" - now why did he say that? He wans't in trouble at the time. I surmise he knew he was about to pull a false flag and would need saving. (Dave is currently doing that though), but listen to this explanation of another definition of Mossad, according to George.

                 Given this understanding, it explains all the references to Mossad, and how it's possible he considers himself part of them, yet is not an agent..

                 During his first interview with Defango, his brother said "fuck George. I don't care what happens to him. He fucked my wife" and then outed George's children. Defango suggested he quietly.  lovingly go help his brother (since Dave was supposedly concerned about his family's good name. David got very defensive "fuck him". Now, he' acting like George is totally innocent and is encouraging people to go after Jason and Trish, put them in jail. They're going to be scapegoated, Dave is echoing the same thing George's followers are saying, and those followers are mostly paid trolls following a script, imo.

                 I think his brother is helping to clean up the scene, so he's working with him, working for the deep state, AND they're both a bit loony. I don't think the story we're being told by Dave is the true one, it all seems like acting, and if he cared about his brother or saving his family's good name, he wouldn't be smearing his brother from popular youtube livestreams, he would go there in person, or handle it quietly.

                 George seems to have no attachment to reality, that plus his blinding narcissism and sex addiction, and enjoyment in hurting females, could be considered mental illness for sure.

            I'm watching DeFango who is streaming the Jason Goodman video of him explaining George Webb's arrest. It was for a DUI, but now the FBI is detaining him. As I watch this, things are getting crazy. Jason Goodman is now being told that he could be arrested!

            None of these are listed as being in custody in Ohio according to VINE. It could be that system has not updated yet, but if detained yesterday, it should be there.

            That said, I don't know what agency would have detained him over the bomb threat. I'm assuming local since it was a hoax. I havent check local custody list for Charleston.

              I dunno. I thought LTV was crazy for saying they're the same person. But I think he's correct that Dave Acton is not to be trusted, and that Dave has given no legitimate reason to keep hiding his face. There is something very strange going on with Dave. Especially in his latest videos, where he's trying to organize all these Youtubers under his leadership.

             Lol, classic deep state ad hominem attack.  The problem with the Defango side in this, is that ALL they have is ad hominem and character attacks.  They have no consistent argument supported by facts.  In fact, all the facts point to the Defango side having mal-intent and they have consistently contradicted themselves with lies.  Hiding behind the 'its a prank bro' defense.  Amateurs.

              I'm actually curious on how defango has been misleading in any way. What has he done to show "mal-intent" I think he has been transparent with the whole thing. Again asking cuz I'm curious

               He doesn't ever present any evidence  or construct an argument based on those facts.  Instead he resorts to character attacks, ad hominem,  bandwagon appeals, appeals to paranoia.  Instead of attacking the message and the argument of why what he did was fishy, he just attacks Jason.   That would never win a single  point in a debate or courtroom.  People who don't have truth and facts  on their  side,  resort  to non-verifiable  assertions and character attacks.  They use  social cues and pressure to try and convince people  to their side instead of  being able to lay out  a reasonable argument.  They also avoid addressing any evidence or points brought up by their opponent.  The surest  sign of a shill.

                I feel you. I was wanting to believe defango but the fact that he ignores certain elements of conversation is suspect. Instead he'd rather drag out a soap opera with lift the veil on YouTube for 3 days

                 Yeah.  Well drama gets views and drama with people  with a larger subscription pool gets even  more views.  As they have their channels monetized  and links for paypal/patreon in every description, its easy to see their  motivation for dragging it out.

            I thought Dave Acton's videos seem weird too. He talks about kids going into fast food from Talmudic jews that think Jesus is boiling in semem in hell. I mean, come on, how would that video help pull his brother out of his paranoia and delusions? "Yeah, my brother is a nut so I will try to get him off on even darker crazier stuff."  Is he trying to play a character that he thinks is what an alt-right kook is? Everything George says about DynCorp sounds way saner than that. Also Dave calls David Seaman a Israeli agent when it is blatantly obvious someone willing to let their articles be published by Huffpo without pay isn't making Israeli money.
           </p>
           <p>
            I think they are probably both playing divide and conquer at this point.  It has effectively gotten me feeling crazy so the gaslighting is effective.  I want nothing to do with either brother going forward.  They have an agenda and it isn't truth.

            David Acton, aka David George Sweigert, looks just like George Webb Sweigert. Either they are twins, or one and the same, as they are the same age. David George Sweigert is also associated with Acton, CA.

             Dave and George could be the poster boys for sibling rivalry. If you spend 5 minutes listening to Dave talk you can pick up 50+ years of brotherly hate. It's spooky as fuck.

            Dave sounded nuts to me the moment I heard him. He also predicts George will commit suicide soon. Truly bizarre and unstable behavior by Dave. Why is he even getting involved at all. Loony toons.

             Yes, it's pretty clear who's "got issues" in that relationship. To be honest it's just sad as fuck.
            </p>
            <p>
             And because I'm an over-educated Irishman I'm going to say there's an eerie parallel between George and Dave's lack of brotherly love with the greater division splitting this entire country down the middle right now.
            </p>
            <p>
             George and Dave's "civil war" is about to get writ large all across this country and that scares the fuck out of me.
            </p>
            <p>
             Why did I have to major in History. Fuck. I wish I didn't see this thing coming.

              Yeah I thought the same thing.  What kind of person talks about their brother that way so openly to everyone in the world. And  Dave Acton is acting like his families suffering so much and poor them, fuck they probably dont even care what George is up to, he's just some estranged  uncle.

              Nice parallel, i agree. And yep ignorance is bliss. I haven't enjoyed any of this. And you're worse off than me since you're seeing history patterns getting closer. Glad i don't know too much about history or my head might cave in.
