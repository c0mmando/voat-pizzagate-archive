<hr />
<p>I\'m not sure if anyone else has had the chance to dig into this or not, but I\'ve been digging into this lately. </p>
<p>There seems to be a pattern, relating to Pedophilliac occurrences and certain Christian Baptist Affiliated organizations within the United States. </p>
<p>One of the most prominent one, ofcourse is the infamous Haiti Trafficking Scandal relating to Ms. Laura Silsby. </p>
<p>Note the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Life_Children%27s_Refuge_case">Wikipedia</a> entry on the Scandal. It states the following: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>The New Life Children’s Refuge (NLCR) was founded in November 2009 by Laura Silsby (now Silsby-Gayler)[5]and Charisa Coulter, who are both members of the <strong>Central Valley Baptist Church</strong> in Meridian, Idaho. The organization described itself as a &quot;non‐profit Christian ministry dedicated to rescuing, loving and caring for orphaned, abandoned and impoverished Haitian and Dominican children, demonstrating God’s love and helping each child find healing, hope, joy and new life in Christ.&quot; The charity claimed to be in the process of acquiring land to build an orphanage as well as a church and school in Magante on the Northern coast of the Dominican Republic. NLCR further intended to provide adoption opportunities for American &quot;loving Christian parents&quot;. On January 12, 2010, Haiti was struck by a major earthquake and NLCR quickly formed the &quot;Haitian Orphan Rescue Mission&quot;, a group of ten people from the <strong>Central Valley Baptist Church</strong> and the <strong>East Side Baptist Church</strong> in Twin Falls, Idaho. Both churches are affiliated with the <strong>Southern Baptist Convention</strong>. The mission\'s plan was to go to Haiti and bring a hundred orphans to Cabarete, Dominican Republic, where NLCR had leased a hotel to serve as a temporary orphanage.</p>

              Lawsuit alleges Temple Baptist Church leaders turned blind eye to woman’s abuse... “The perpetrators were both uncertified male teachers who had been raised in the culture of the Temple Baptist Church and School,” according to her complaint filed last month in District Court. “The second perpetrator teacher essentially ‘dated’ Plaintiff as a 12-15 year old child, and groomed her to participate in his sexual abuse of her in those years as part of a ‘relationship’ and ‘God’s will.’ ”
