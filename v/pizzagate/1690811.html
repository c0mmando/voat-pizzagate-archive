            Absolutely. I agree with all of your points.  I think it is very important, during this trying time, to try to separate what is vile from what is healthy.  With the fact that children
            <em>
             are
            </em>
            more sexually advanced than maybe my parents were at those crucial ages, it is important that these same children are knowledgeable in the subjects.  You can healthily teach a child about sex if you make sure to use medical language and make it very clear that your parts are
            <strong>
             yours.
            </strong>
            My niece started asking questions about the difference between girls and boys and "why does daddy have a penis but I don't" when she was around 5.  My aunt, being an OB nurse, took the time to explain (as well as you can to a 5 year old without completely destroying naivety) the difference between boys and girls.  She continued to ask questions, and if something was too soon for her my aunt simply said "i will explain that when you're older."  It was very healthy, very informative, and she (my niece) left the conversation satisfied with the information she was given.

            Have to down vote because honestly it is something we should discuss with our children, most kids probably look at porn before they are in 8th grade.
