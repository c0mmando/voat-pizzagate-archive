   Anyone else think that it is odd that so many powerful and rich people are associated with such an ugly, decrepit pizza place?

            That's what gets me. Even without the "pedophile ring" thing, the whole situation is still sketchy as hell. The restaurant itself looks like they were trying for a quirky, eclectic, hipster warehouse look and missed. Instead, it just looks like it was slapped together out of spare parts. (Check out the walls and floor around the ping pong and foosball tables. It's like they gutted the building at one point and did nothing to it.) It's right next to another pizza place. The whole thing has that i-don't-really-give-a-shit money laundering front feel to it.

            I think it's clear that the Washington elites are going there
            <em>
             because
            </em>
            James Alefantis owns it, and Alefantis is the 49th most powerful person in spite of owning this weird pizza joint, not because of it. The real question is
            <em>
             why
            </em>
            ?

            Stop shilling faggot. Did we ask for your worthless opinion?

           <p>
            No we didn't. This is another FACT that OP has mentioned, which is relevant. It makes no sense for the rich to go to a pile of shit "restaurant" like this one. I've seen better kebab places and no rich go there.
           </p>
           <p>
            Nobody is saying that this is the sole reason. Its another reason to keep digging. That's all. Anything can help. Nothing the OP said is incorrect. I was also surprised at the overall terrible quality of this place.
