            That's what these narcissistic manipulators do. They are 100% self-serving. They'll run through every emotion in the book, from rage to begging to tears to indifference and back again, trying to find the one that gets you to do what they want. They love to play the victim to try to convince the actual victims that they're the ones in need of consolation. If he's threatening suicide, it's just more manipulation.

             Don't forget it was a kike who blew this story wide open (Ronan Farrow) and a kike who is breaking open the false flag in LV, Laura Loomer.  Trump is almost a kike - and he is fighting the DS/swamp.

            <p>
             All that aside, I agree, if he "offs" himself, or more likely, someone does it for him, we will see what happened, but the rest of the world will mourn the pig for about 5 minutes and the whole thing goes away.  The good thing is slime like him don't want to die and he can afford the best in a protective detail.

            This is an intentional sacrifice by the deepstate to throw everyone off their pizzagate crimes.
           </p>
           <p>
            DOJ orders FBI to investigate Weinstein? What a fucking joke. The FBI is involved as well as the DOJ. Are they investigating the murder of Chester Bennington,or Chris? What the hell are they doing in Las Vegas...
           </p>
           <p>
            He is a sacrifice by the deepstate to try and gain credibility that they care about child abuse...
           </p>
           <p>
            Yes they are cornered so it might have been forced but he is a distraction as well...an intentional one.
           </p>
           <p>
            He will not be interrogated or investigated. That is like asking Registered Sex Offenders to investigate Hollywood...joke.
           </p>
           <p>
            Now can we now use the deepstate against them selves yes. Expose Harvey but pressure the politicians associated that is what they don't want. Continuously connect pizzagate, CIA MK Ultra, child trafficking together including FBI brass involvement, blackmail schemes, DOJ Child Trafficking division led by Aron Rao and Andrew Kline...connected directly to James Alefantis Instagram and Besta Pizza. Found in possession of child porn by Obama AG Holder and covered up....then gets promoted by Obama to top prosecutor of child sex trafficking. That is a fucking joke.
           </p>
           <p>
            DOJ Steve Wasserman (Debbie's brother) is the D.C. Federal prosecutor..the assistant is Deputy DA Machando (married to Jo Ann Wasserman)
           </p>
           <p>
            These are the head of the snake....pressure them. Pressure fired Sally Yates and why as Deputy AG sho allowed this and is now out campaigning for Ohio AG to flip them against Trump...
           </p>
           <p>
            Keep it up on Hollywood but go for the head of the snake...

             I agree, but it has to start somewhere.  The American public is about 20X more tuned into Hollywood than DC.  Every photo of HW has either a recognizable star or politician with them.  That right there connects them.  The most tactical action I can think of at this point is get something pedo to hang around that pig's neck.

             Yes, DOJ/FBI and State/CIA (and all their subordinate agencies, etc.) are the two most corrupted organizations in our government.  They are stacked 20 deep with Deep State operatives, yes men, and sheep.  Unless Trump &amp; Co. are willing to start polygraphing everyone, they will never be able to clean things up.

            Think about LBJ and Bobby Bakker with their prostitution set up used to blackmail members of Congress.

            Think about Watergate where at least one of the side issues was Democratic Party's prostitution rings
and pedophile rings.  Detective Rothstein in interview with Fetzer/YouTube says that at that time the
"Book of Names" of higher ups" was at the Watergate.

            Detective Rothstein is making clear that WATERGATE was also not only about prostitution rings being run by the Democratic Party, but also about pedophile rings.  And that a "book" recording this information was at the DNC/Watergate building which seems to be one cause for the break in.

            One of the scandals which LBJ escaped after the assassination of JFK involved Bobby Bakker who he worked closely with ...

           <p>
            LBJ and Bobby Bakker were running prostitution rings in order to entrap members of Congress.   Hotel rooms were set up where women of the night/day were provided to lure members of Congress.

            All predators and pedophiles become 'suicidal' when they're found out.  He's lived his life buying his way out of trouble, courts and prison.  But he now finds himself in a position where money can't buy him out of being ostracized by the industry and by the public.  I don't feel sorry for him one bit.

            This is some more wag-the-dog Hollywood bullshit. The minute this broke we knew he was gonna be suicided, right? It's just a matter of time. Thing is, this whole thing reads like a shitty script to a shitty movie that only morons fall for.... All of Hollywood is entrenched in this shit but we're to believe that all these celebrities are shocked and appalled?? PLEASE. It's actually insulting. Seems to me this is more like an attempt to sacrifice mr. Weinstein (figuratively or otherwise) to keep us of their trail. The evil fat bastard gets crucified while the "good guys" are left to make sure such a horrible thing never happens again. Yeah...uh huh. The dummies believe them and quit looking into their sordid shithole, thereby keeping PG from coming to the surface. Bc you know damn well these kid stars didn't get where they are through talent any more than the adults did. But they will try their hardest to never let that see the light of day. This whole thing is a well orchestrated plan. Our only hope is people don't fall for the manufactured outrage.

             I, sure as shit, won't stop looking any time soon - whether I continue to post my findings while a certain somebody is actively trying to shit on my work, though, remains to be determined.

               Cancerous karma like his has a way of returning in spades. Try to be a little less cynical, I copped a bout of that myself yesterday. Let others enjoy the shitshow, this is just another 'battle', plenty more to come.

            15,003 subscribers, awesome!! and I can only imagine how many lurkers. Please EVERYONE come out of the woodwork!! we have been here for almost 11 months now working on exposing worldwide crimes against children and corruption. If this pig takes himself out, it will vindicate so many of our posts.

               Not being computer savvy or have any skills in the investigating department I always hoped I was helping by upvoating and spreading the word. I have a few times sent different people messages here as 'cleanhouse' but had to change my name due to not being able to sgn in. I shouldn't have said anything. I feel silly now lol.I just wanted you all to know we appreciate your hard work. Cheers.

             Not really, if he confesses and implicates others would vindicate the posts. Suicide just makes it a conspiracy again since so many questions would go unanswered and real, as well as more fake, claims would be made.

            Suicidal? We can only hope.  Tho I doubt he'd want to miss the "horse therapy" like Carlos Danger.

             Don't bring your anti-Semitic shit on my OP.  I'm not Jewish for the record.  I know a lot of them.  And while some are libs, they are all good decent people.  And I checked for horns under the however-the-hell-you-spell-it beanie.
            </p>
            <p>
             I look at facts and history.  Jews are arguably the smallest recognized minority on Earth.  It is documented that millions of them were persecuted and killed. To deny otherwise is to adopt the party practice of anti-Semitism as demonstrated repeatedly over multiple regimes on various continents.  So save your breath dickhead shills - to deny otherwise only further cements your role here as anti-Jew - tote the party narrative.

              And you were never curious enough to ask why they were singled out and persecuted time and time again? ... I mean, there's two sides to every story, right? We have only heard one side and it has been told by (((them))). You never did get to hear what Pharoah had to say... And we certainly didn't enter WW2 to rescue the jews... I don't care if they are chosen by God or the Devil... there are some interesting events that surround them, but are shrouded in darkness. To even ask questions makes a person anti-Semitic. Why? They're just questions. It's not like Jews have anything to hide.... right?

               Good, Bad &amp; Ugly in every race, at the end of the day we are ALL in the HUMAN RACE! Just get over judging and accusing everyone and anyone. I agree with

               - if the people here are not here to cover up or distract us from exposing the crimes against children, lets continue to work together.  We are not here to be the judge, (we don't have the authority to do that) we are here to uncover the people involved in pizzagate...........for that judgement. Forget these petty internal one-upmanship point scoring.  We all have the same goal at the end of the day............save the children and see these sick elite pedos LOCKED UP.

              Yikes. Firstly, if you want to look at facts, american-jews are in control of most of the media/hollywood/etc. so if you think those industries are corrupt, then you have to admit there's a striking number of american jews who are not in fact nice people. So, be careful when you start throwing around the assumption that you are so objectively focused. There's always new information you may be unaware of.
             </p>
             <p>
              Secondly, your points about jews being a small number on earth and having been persecuted doesn't really matter. It's hard to find cultures and/or groups who haven't been persecuted at some point in history. Why do we have to pay for our fathers fathers fathers fathers sins?
             </p>
             <p>
              Also, since I refreshed and say your edit, saying crap like
             </p>
             <blockquote>
              <p>
               go fuck yourself.
              </p>
             </blockquote>
             <p>
              Makes you look like a quick-tempered dick. So, if you're trying to win hearts, you're not doing yourself any favors.

               I'm not trying to win hearts.  This isn't a popularity contest.  I'll take your comment at face value.  If you've spent any amount of time here in this sub, you would be tired of the incessant "Jew Derangement Syndrome" from the Hitler Youth NAMBLA Brigade.

               Secondly, if you were "really" up to speed on your history, you would know that the Nazism and Communism have mostly settled their differences and are the same thing.  These "Jew haters"^^^ are Communists by ideology which have arisen through the 4th Reich of the Nazis....and merged.  When you see the same mantra, with no ability to speak on any other subject except anti-Jew - that's a Nazi pawn doing what they are told.  Little boys behind a computer....

            I just heard this on Tucker Carlson &amp; I believe a user in our sub said he would commit suicide a few days ago when Ronan's piece came out. Apparently, his daughter was the one that called the police to say her father was suicidal, and then later told them it was "just a family dispute". Interesting, to say the least. 
edit: you were that user, OP, lol
