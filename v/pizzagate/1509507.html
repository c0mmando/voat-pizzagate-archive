<p>August 12, 2014</p>

<p>Sunday, August 17, 2014</p>
<p>Yesterday two suspected members of the Ninth Circle Satanic Child Sacrifice Cult were arrested during their preparations for what appeared to be a child sacrifice. Evidently the child homicide was to take place on a blood-stained altar in the basement of a residence in the upscale neighborhood of Outremont Montreal Quebec Canada. During an older woman’s arrest she admitted that the child sacrifice was scheduled for midnight and involved executives of America’s Sinclair Oil and food giant Cargill Corporation. According to an officer of the Brussels Belgium ICLCJ Court, their team worked in conjunction with Montreal police to perform the citizens arrests.</p>
<p>“This informant claimed that the two children to be used at the Montreal event were held at a separate facility at McGill University,” the ICLCJ Court press release stated, “but she claimed not to know where. She said that the normal procedure was to deliver them in a drugged condition just before the ritual began. The woman said cult members describe themselves as part of the Ninth Circle society and carried tattoos of the Ninth Circle insignia.​”</p>
<p>“Cargill Corporation Executive Kerry Brick is among the suspected Ninth Circle Satanic Child Sacrifice Cult members,” Kevin Annett of the ITCCS said in today’s interview. “Months ago a survivor testified that as a child they were taken to Cargill Corporate Headquarters in Wayzata Minn where they were forced to observe a child sacrifice. From what other eyewitnesses reported to the ICLCJ Court, Ninth Circle members appear to be very influential and able to get away with doing child sacrifices across the globe.”</p>
<p>A security guard at the Montreal private residence showed arresting officers a small sub-basement sound proof chamber that contained a blood-stained stone altar and two small prison cells with wall shackles. An adjoining room held locked cabinets with child pornographic material and articles of children’s clothing. Evidence such as samples of blood, metallic torture devices, ceremonial swords and sophisticated film equipment was photographed and bagged for analysis.</p>
<p>The suspect identified child sacrifice participants as Cargill Corporation Executive Kerry Brick of Wayzata Minnesota and Sinclair Oil Executive Stephen Holding of Sun Valley Idaho. A prior ICLCJ document claimed other Ninth Circle members included Montreal Catholic Archbishop Christian Lepine and a prominent US billionaire. This same influential American businessman has been identified by eyewitnesses as being at Ninth Circle human hunting parties in the Netherlands. Children were stripped naked, raped, hunted down and killed – as were children in an Australian CIA mind control program according to eyewitness Fiona Barnett. Barnett chronicled her experiences in this article.</p>
<p>“Our team restrained all three prisoners, locked down the premises and took videos and samples from the underground chamber,” wrote a member of the arrest team. “We then secured a covert ​perimeter in the neighborhood in ​anticipation of the arrival of the cult participants and their victims. Unfortunately, although we maintained our vigil until well after midnight, ​no-one else arrived at the premises for the rest of that day and evening. We must assume that the participants were somehow alerted to our presence and aborted the ritual.”</p>
<p>Montreal police supported the Ninth Circle member citizens arrests and planned to eventually take charge of the suspects. “The security guard in our custody was released after he proved that he had been retained in a private commercial capacity. The two cult members are being held in our DAU prison facility in Montreal prior to their questioning by the Court Prosecutor and his Canadian affiliates. All samples and film we obtained are in transit to Brussels headquarters for analysis.”</p>
<p>The International Tribunal into Crimes of Church and State, which has been prosecuting cases against Ninth Circle Satanic Cult members in the ICLCJ Court since 2011, had called for protests against child sacrifices believed scheduled on Aug. 15 for Reine du Monde Cathedral in Montreal and Pro Cathedral in Dublin Ireland. The Ireland child sacrifice was thought to be under the direction of Catholic Archbishop Dermot Martin. Evidently because of protests, the Montreal child sacrifice was relocated from the Montreal Cathedral sub basement crypt to an underground facility at McGill University, then to the private estate in Outremont Montreal.</p>
<p>McGill University had a history of torturing children in satanic-related mind control experiments. In the early 1950s at McGill, President of the Canadian, American and World Psychiatric Associations D. Ewen Cameron, tortured children as part of USA’s CIA MKULTRA program. In 1964 the US Congress supposedly shut down MKULTRA after a successful lawsuit against Cameron and McGill University by mind control survivor Linda MacDonald.</p>
<p>In these videos mind control survivors Claudia Mullen and Christina Nicola testified in the 1995 Congressional hearings about the CIA mind control of children. MKULTRA supposedly ended in 1964. However, in this video Jenny Hill discussed her 1965 witness to a child sacrifice under the direction of a CIA master mind controller thought to be head of the government’s program. The first fifty comments in this petition to Congress for an investigation of the CIA program, most by CIA mind control survivors, indicated that children were still being tortured even today in the government program.</p>
<p>Witnesses to these child sacrifices have alleged that the Ndrangheta Criminal Syndicate worked with police, Vatican and Catholic orphanages to provide children for torture and killing in monthly blood sacrifice rituals by the Ninth Circle. There have been 34 Catholic child mass grave sites found in Ireland, Spain and Canada. The grounds were believed to contain bodies of over 350,800 missing childrenalthough the respective governments and Catholic Church have refused ITCCS’s continuous requests for excavation.</p>
<p>Popes Francis and Ratzinger, plus Queen Elizabeth have all been named by eyewitness testifying before the ICLCJ Court as having killed and raped children in Ninth Circle Satanic Cult human sacrifice ceremonies. Over 60 eyewitnesses from several different countries have testified, with more contacting the Court each week.</p>
<p>Since 2011 six judges and 28 jury members of the ICLCJ Court have been litigating Ninth Circle Satanic Cult members. In Aug 2014 Pope Francis was found guilty of child trafficking; Pope Ratzinger resigned after his 2013 guilty verdict for Crimes Against Humanity and Queen Elizabeth and Prince Phillip were issued arrest warrants for their guilty verdicts in the 1964 disappearance of ten children from the Canadian British Columbia Kamloops Native Residential School.</p>
<p>The ICLCJ Court has over 450 Common Law Peace Officers in 13 countries, with 51 local chartered groups operating. Organizing funds were available for common law groups wishing to apply.

            Be wary. Even those who claim to be victims or fighting for victims, can sometimes be culprits seeking to sabotage from within by misleading and destroying credibility. Check the sources.

           </blockquote>
           <p>
            Cargill doesn't have a Kerry Brick listed on their executive team page:
            <a href="http://www.cargill.com/company/management/index.jsp">
             http://www.cargill.com/company/management/index.jsp
            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            The only thing close to a primary source that I can find is
            <a href="http://itccs.org/">
             http://itccs.org/
            </a>
            which is owned by the guy named Kevin Annett.
           </p>
           <p>
            Example:
            <a href="http://itccs.org/2014/08/16/child-sacrificial-cult-disrupted-arrests-made-in-montreal/">
             http://itccs.org/2014/08/16/child-sacrificial-cult-disrupted-arrests-made-in-montreal/
            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            But I can't find any actual primary sources. Like here he lists the other nations where ITCCS people are involved, but the people themselves are not listed. nobody.
            <a href="http://itccs.org/countries-affiliated-with-the-international-tribunal/">
             http://itccs.org/countries-affiliated-with-the-international-tribunal/
            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            Anyway from the first article linked:
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             Montreal police supported the Ninth Circle member citizens arrests and planned to eventually take charge of the suspects.
            </p>
           </blockquote>
           <p>
            Okay so there should be at least one report somewhere of this.
           </p>
           <p>
            I'm trying to find it but it's all looping back. Like there is this:
            <a href="https://dublinsmickdotcom.wordpress.com/2014/08/16/child-sacrificial-cult-disrupted-arrests-made-in-montreal/">
             https://dublinsmickdotcom.wordpress.com/2014/08/16/child-sacrificial-cult-disrupted-arrests-made-in-montreal/
            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            But it uses the
            <a href="http://itccs.org/">
             http://itccs.org/
            </a>
            webpage as its source.
           </p>
           <p>
            Yet another blog:
            <a href="https://kauilapele.wordpress.com/2014/08/16/kevin-annett-8-16-14-video-child-sacrificial-cult-disrupted-arrests-made-in-montreal-and-exopolitics-itccs-takes-down-satanic-child-sacrifice-exposes-cargill-sinclair-oil-execs-montreal/">

            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            But the source video has been deleted.
           </p>
           <p>
            People were arguing about whether or not this was a hoax back in 2014, as well (see comments):
            <a href="http://12160.info/profiles/blogs/child-sacrificial-cult-disrupted-arrests-made-in-montreal">
             http://12160.info/profiles/blogs/child-sacrificial-cult-disrupted-arrests-made-in-montreal
            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            So who the hell is "Kerry Brick" supposed to be?
           </p>
           <p>
            <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/kerrybrick">
             https://www.linkedin.com/in/kerrybrick
            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            He's the.. Manager of Pension Investments. The guy is responsible for overseeing the company's retirement programs. Not an executive.
           </p>
           <p>
            So at this point, I'm suspecting Kevin Annett of being a deliberate disinfo agent trying to sabotage actual work done in this area. So who is this guy. The way the 'sources' work is just like how Washington Post's bullshit works. The Washington Post will make claims without having actual sources, and then other outlets regurgitate the claims while citing the Washington Post as their source.
           </p>
           <p>
            Everyone can investigate whatever they want, obviously, but I'd say proceed with caution on this one.

             Brick seems high enough in Cargill.  He oversees all the finances.  I don't think the article said he owned it.
            </p>
            <p>
             But yes, I'm not able to find anything about the company and pardophelia besides this article.  But I don't think it's false.  The author has books out and is a psychologist and is referring to actual investigations/cases in Belgium.  I have seen other articles about Brussels Belgium cases before, but they weren't as detailed about the witnesses and testimonies.
            </p>
            <p>
             I'll keep digging
