            It's worth noting that the CIA and Military have ways of putting people to sleep temporarily in a building they want to take. In fact they can even spray an entire village and put them to sleep for a couple of hours.
            <a href="https://youtu.be/AkKnRTCl-jI?t=390">
             George Webb mentioned it recently.
            </a>
            In the 1950s the British tested out sleep agents on an entire village without telling them one night. They ended up getting into deep shit for it later.
           </p>
           <p>
            You would have expected TPTB to have used that chemical sleep agent to pacify the Waco Compound before going in and taking it over. The fact that wasn't done points to Waco being a planned execution kind of like Jim Jones and company down in Guiyana which was also a CIA black ops site.

            I thought it was interesting that Kay Griggs mentioned Waco in her longer video exposing systemic corruption She didn't say anything specific, just that what happened there was terrible.

            Can't trust some random guy on 4chan, let alone one who has tons of other theories without proof.
           </p>
           <p>
            If you trust this then you also should trust the poster who says believe ISIS robbed Kim Kardashian in Paris and killed her staff and security.
           </p>
           <p>
            If you trust this then you also should trust the poster who says aliens haven't visited us because of how "The Left/SJW" act.
           </p>
           <p>
            I'm not saying there's no chance this claim isn't true, but you're putting blind trust into a random guy on the internet who has also made some pretty buckwild claims. Instead of writing this comment I could've written one about how he's wrong and it was actually to cover up an alien investigation there and it would have just as much credibility as this post.

             You shouldn't trust anyone, regardless of their locale choice for posting. You should, however, consider all plausible connections brought fourth by anyone and do your own research to then assert for yourself your own opinion.

             If you are looking for people to trust, you came to the wrong planet.

            Let me know when anybody completely figures out what Koresh and crowd was all about. Besides Hillary giving orders to "burn the MF to the ground" ... which happened. I ran into the house to watch it live, waiting for all those kids to come running out ... no kids. Made me sick, was in disbelief.

            "Waco was a cover up in relation to child trafficking/sex rings, but not in the way you immediately think.
           </p>
           <p>
            The Waco Compound &amp; the "cult" that was in it was part of a "underground railroad" type network that was saving children from Elite child sex rings in the US and getting them to safety.
           </p>
           <p>
            With that being said, that explains the significant response(to the point of sending in tanks &amp; burning the place down &amp; shooting everyone one inside to death) against the "cult"/Compound &amp; the following coverup.
           </p>
           <p>
            Many, many more children died in that compound then what was officially reported.(Shot,burn't,crushed) It was a clean up operation.
           </p>
           <p>
            Waco was televised so much inorder to send a message to similar child saving networks."

             I have a tough time believing anyone would set up a child rescue operation right next to a well known military base.  Makes zero sense to place children that close to the same people who are abusing them.  Makes far more sense that the Branch Davidians either were getting sloppy with their operation or had gone rouge.
