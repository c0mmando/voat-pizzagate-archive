<p>So I\'ve been reading through CDANs Blinds today &amp; I remember we were trying to figure out if Epstein has a sibling.. well I\'m not great at post submissions so sorry if I screw this up but i thought this was important. </p>
<p>I tried posting the links, but its saying they are &quot;banned domains&quot; and I have to leave in 2min so i dont have time to refresh my memory of the sidebar rules, ack! But it\'s all in the comments @ CDAN. </p>
<p>Ok.. so check this out:</p>
<p>• August 6th: Blind Item #12:</p>
<p>The behind the scenes players are still making massive amounts of money pimping out a group of A list models you would refer to by their employer. The one making the most money is the sibling of the pedophile. </p>

<ul>
<li>It\'s not revealed BUT there are several comments from people naming some people who may be his sibling. </li>
</ul>
<p>• A few people mentioned &quot;Mark Epstein&quot; and someone else says theres an article about his brother in &quot;The Atlantic&quot; ??</p>
<p>• I also saw someone left a LinkedIn  link about</p>
<p>Mark Epstein - I went to it &amp; its FULL of info!! Idk how to archive but it looks like theres a goldmine of info! </p>
<p>linkedin.com/in/mark-epstein-3a14874/</p>
<p>• Another comment about Mark Epstein with a link:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.google.com/amp/s/amp.businessinsider.com/the-nyc-building-at-the-center-of-jeffrey-epsteins-web-2019-8">https://www.google.com/amp/s/amp.businessinsider.com/the-nyc-building-at-the-center-of-jeffrey-epsteins-web-2019-8</a></p>
<p>• The building owned by Mark Epstein houses many models, maybe some of them VS models? Rapist/predator Jean-Luc Brunel, had an apartment there.</p>
<p>• Another interesting comment:</p>
<p>I used to live on E. 65th Street Right around the corner from this apartment complex where Epstein\'s girls lived.</p>
<p>There was one big event there I\'ll never forget.</p>
<p>I was walking to dinner on East 66th Street to Fig and Olive on the UES,</p>
<p>when I realized I was literally walking in front of the world\'s media.</p>
<p>I\'ve worked in television and in news and I\'ve never seen press like this in my entire life. I was so f+cking startled, I couldn\'t figure out what was happening. I\'m likely on video or in photos somewhere because I was the lone person at the time walking in front of them. They were on the Northside of the street, I was on the South.</p>
<p>So here\'s the interesting part, guess who they were there to capture?</p>
<p>Someone who lived there who was the biggest story in the news.</p>
<p>DOMINQUE STRAUSS-KAHN. Interesting he was in the news for sexual assault. In hindsight, I\'ve learned from friends in the NYPD it was a political setup to destroy him. The maid who claimed rape was in on it too. Regardless, interesting person to live in that building.</p>
<p>A man who LOVED women. Would be interesting to learn his connections to Epstein.</p>
<p>☆ And this is PG related because hello.. Epstein! ;) </p>
<p>I hope this helps.. </p>
<p>&amp; again, sorry if I messed this up. I\'m using my cellphone &amp; I\'ve had 2 hrs sleep. </p>
<p>Love &amp; Blessings to you all ♡</p>',

            Though it wasn’t listed in the unsealed indictment on Monday, a 2010 deposition obtained by the Miami Herald claimed that Epstein also had units at 301 East 66th Street. In the 16-story residential building — which appears to be connected to his brother Mark’s real estate company, Osso Properties — Epstein allegedly housed his victims four at a time in individual apartments, charging them $1,000 a month through his business partner Jean-Luc Brunel, who owned the modeling agency Mc2. According to the 2010 deposition, Epstein invested $1 million in Mc2.

            Great post Nina. Yes the Victoria Secret “Angels” in the major ad campaigns are likely the models who are pimped out. Years back, that is likely how Stephanie Seymour met her husband Peter Brant the one time Billionaire who makes his money by ripping people off and scamming.

              No when I stated “pimped out” I don’t mean like street pimping it’s a term for sex for money in elite circles, men with big money and often bizarre kinky fetishes. Peter had nothing to do with the transactions or exchanges, he (as a Billionaire at that time) more than likely met Seymour that way if she was in that inner roster of VS girls doing sex for money with elites which she more than likely was. Brant is heavily into the shitty “art” scene where numerous connections have been made with art, kids and the occult.

             Yep agreed. I've known about this mofo since around 2016. Yes, thank goodness his filth has risen to the surface. I'm just so terrified we may not get the conviction we want with the judge, Comeys daughter, &amp; God knows what else they've got up their dirty sleeves.

            Yes the models are pimped out to rich men. One former model resigned because of it and wrote a book. I'll try to find the link.

                From memory, Karen Mulder did not write a book. She was dating Prince Albert. She then went on a tv show and claimed she was raped by royalty and celebrities. She was then whisked away by minders to a mental institution and has never really resurfaced since. She broke the code of silence.  She has been labelled a nutter ever since. How can your reputation recover from that? She was reported as trying to take her own life, although I wouldn't be surprised if that story was spread just to make her look more loopy.  I think she was the most beautiful of the supermodels (when 'supermodel' meant something).    I have just found
                <a href="https://www.thefreelibrary.com/I+was+a+catwalk+sex+and+drugs+slave%3B+BY+SUPERMODEL+KAREN+MULDER.-a081189443">

                which says:
               </p>
               <p>
                VKaren, 33, said she was raped repeatedly by former members of her model agency, Elite.
               </p>
               <blockquote>
                <p>
                 She claimed she was forced to sleep with powerful men, including a member of a European royal family, to get better catwalk work.
                </p>
                <p>
                 Karen said people tried to kill her, and girls from Elite were used as sex slaves by senior figures in the police and French government.

                 Yw! CThere’s a number of supermodels that wrote books, I didn’t get that far cross referencing to VS models though. I’m thinking Janice Dickerson’s book is probably the most scandalous.
