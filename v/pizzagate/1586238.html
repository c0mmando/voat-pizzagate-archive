            Out comes the straw man argument again. Where did I say ALL gay pedophile are pedophiles? Tactics of the pro-gay-pedophile left when they loose an argument is to start making up lies about the opposition.
You said I said it but where did I say it here? Quote me. I just said the average gay person is more likely to fuck a child by a factor of 20-30 compared to a heterosexual. Where the medical and scientific arguments are and the last person who tried to use that straw man on me is here:

            Title of that thread "all these faggot pedophiles deserve to die - boylover.org". Unless you lover boylover.org and argue that those who fuck little boys must be respected, you can't complain about me calling them faggot pedophiles.

            banned because I debunked her political correctness and showed the most prominent gay rights activist in Australia has been forensically proven to threaten to RAPE, SODOMIZE and MURDER female anti-pedophilia activists in 2x youtube videos  MUST BE RESPECTED BECAUSE THEY ARE GAY - she banned me for harassment for disagreeing with a Cultural Marxist on these forums.

           <p>
            See if you don't agree with a moderator that those who threaten to rape-sodomize-and murder ANTI-PEDOPHILIA activists by name as exposed in the youtube videos I shared with forensic proof - you gotta be banned for "harrasment". (&lt;- Does not speak for ALL moderator) The civil, academic argument went down here:

            Sorry to talk about gay rights activists Garry Burns threatening to rape, sodomize and murder female anti-pedophilia activists like the mod I was arguing with but that really did happen to the female head of Occupy Pedophilia St Petersberg, and I wanted the moderator to get perspective.

            want's to mix up the founding of the gay rights movement in AMERICA vs the Founding of the Gay rights movement globally (goes back to Prussia) I could dump the dirt on those who coined the term "homosexual" being linked to pederasty and boy rape too, but I think with them being long dead it doesn't relate to pizzagate, so we'll leave it for now. But if triggered, I could easily dump my archived research on this topic if anyone asked.

            I'll go delete the scribd and the complaint on pizzagate memes in 15 mins.
           </p>
           <p>
            In that example was calling boylover.org faggot pedophile, and it was protected free speech against scum of the earth.
Also my father is being sued blah blab blah you saw before for criticizing mark newton and peter truong who are mainstream news verified (that means shit - but it's true anyway) BOYLOVER.NET members, so I hate boylovers even more than the average folks.
           </p>
           <p>
            The reason cited for the ban as you know was harassment or a mod loosing the argument - and my last words was I agree it's finished sorry to upset you but I was right. My use of the English was correct boylovers are homosexual pedophiles that do exist. I chose not to use the endering word for homosexual. The NSW Police even put the word faggot on the front of a brochure to stop "hate speech" which I find ironic. It's since been redacted about 5 years ago.
1% of pedophiles pure ped
35% pedophiles homosexual peds
the rest hetrosexual pedophiles according to bravehearts.org.au and other research papers.

            and try not to trigger them too hard. Remember the Pizzagate perps are democrat leftists and friends with managers gay advocacy groups run by pedophile Terry Bean as I exposed, the first to attempt a civil settlement in a criminal boy rape case.

            my 12 year old granddaughter recently took sex ed at school.  I was flabbergasted when she told me they had a book but were not allowed to take it home. My daughter was not concerned. I would have stormed the school demanding to see what they are teaching.

             Public schools are just another way the NWO gets their propaganda out and mocks anyone who disagrees with them. Did homeschooling for a long time and that wasn't immune to it either. Unschooling is where it's at.

            Kevin Jennings - Assistant Deputy heading the Office of Safe and Drug-Free Schools at the U.S. Department of Education
           </p>
           <p>
            A teacher was told by a 15-year-old high school sophomore that he was having homosexual sex with an "older man." At the very least, statutory rape occurred. Fox News reported that the teacher violated a state law requiring that he report the abuse. That former teacher, Kevin Jennings, is President Obama's "safe school czar." It's getting hard to keep track of all of this president's problematic appointments. Clearly, the process for vetting White House employees has broken down.

And I said, Brewster, what are you doing in there asleep? And he said, Well, Im tired. And I said, Well we all are tired and we all got to school today. And he said, Well I was out late last night. And I said, What were you doing out late on a school night. And he said, Well, I was in Boston Boston was about 45 minutes from Concord. So I said, What were you doing in Boston on a school night Brewster? He got very quiet, and he finally looked at me and said, Well I met someone in the bus station bathroom and I went home with him. High school sophomore, 15 years old. That was the only way he knew how to meet gay people. I was a closeted gay teacher, 24 years old, didnt know what to say. Knew I should say something quickly so I finally said, My best friend had just died of AIDS the week before. I looked at Brewster and said, You know, I hope you knew to use a condom. He said to me something I will never forget, He said Why should I, my life isnt worth saving anyway.

             There's a very distinct difference between two consenting adults of the same gender having sex and an adult having sex with a minor. Do not politicize this as it works toward discrediting the pizzagate movement.

              Well even though they are the same gender the age difference between an "older man" and a 15 yr. old boy is still suspect.  If that boy was experimenting with people his own age, then fine as long as he had the information on safe sex.  But the older man younger boy is just as bad as Older man younger girl.  Let's keep things in perspective.  It is still sexual abuse imo.

               ) It's pedophilia - not education. OTO Satanist Alister Crowley's minion Alfred Kinsey timed 4 months babies time to orgasm when being anal raped (shaking in pain = orgasm) to prove children are sexually active from birth hence why schools have sex education now AND PENALTIES FOR CHILD SEX REDUCED UNDER THE "MODEL PENAL CODE".

              More info on Christopher Kent Bowersox, the man who said he was gay, who attempted to murder me who I thrashed in court who's now a child sex offender, parole violating gay pedo cop.

              Wow they updated his photo and address and he grew a beard. How fitting. The scary thing is he got his 16 guns back after being released after 2 years for time served, and couldn't stay away from the CP. And then I tune into Baksersfield NPR for the first time since leaving in 2015 and after 10 seconds I hear the news. Gay pedophiles In california fight for their basic human right to live next to schools. America is going the way of Australia very quickly where journalists like Derryn Hinch get jailed for reporting about gay child fucking judge Simon Cooper who raped two boys and got no punishment whatsoever and no sex offender listing, and a court order for the media not to cover it.

              - So the founder of the US GAY RIGHTS MOVEMENT doesn't go to NAMBLA meetings? And the origin of gay rights in America too has nothing to do with NAMBLA! then what's this?

              Obama''s child anal fisting Safe School Tsar wrote a book praising Harry Hay.
Want to see a picture of the undisputed founder of gay rights in America wearing his NAMBLA walks with me T-Shirt. I already put the videos of him being filmed IN THE NAMLBA I wanna fuck little boys meetings.
You can't disassociate the founder of gay rights with America and fucking little boys any more than you can disassociate homosexuality and pedophilia.

              That's a reply to James I love Infants boyfriend at Media Matters who was bending the truth about Harry Hay featuring said picture.
By the way - Mass Resistance just released a book showing how the gay movement wants to recruit, rape and destroy children drastically reducing their quality of life.
Support the cause that exposes homosexuality is pedophilia or at least perversion. And stop attacking me after a gay child raping pedo cop stopped me seeing my first born. If I was to rape or take away your little girl, and you turned gay I wouldn't understand that you would HATE all heterosexuals for life and wouldn't order you to love thy rapist or child abuser like the Australian courts have. more details here:

            Omg! If this nasty shit is allowed in public schools, it is time to take the mandate off of parents being required to send their kids to school! 
I am so tired of the LGBT community trying to turn our kids into their idea of sexual acceptance! I want to vomit!

            I always thought with the complex access control model in moodle.org it could be used for grooming by the pedophiles. Guess I was right.

             Excellent observation. "Complex access control" should be a household phrase, and parents should roundly reject it. In my opinion, they should also pull their children from these school districts immediately.

              I use moodle.org - it's access control system allows all sorts of crazy fine grained access controls, to make it possible for parents accounts to not be able to see things the student sees in their online courses.

               It's ridiculous, and totally unacceptable.

               No matter how I approach this calamity, the way out always points to: parents CARING for their children. If every family took their children back from the claws of the state, this pandemic would end instantly. PARENTS, WAKE THE FUCK UP! This is ultimately your fault. Stop feeding your children to the wolves.

                I home school. International Schools scare me and I'm an expat. I know of a known ASIO pederast already in one school in Hanoi. "Your fault" applies to parents who put their kids in the public school system without good vigilance.  not me btw.
