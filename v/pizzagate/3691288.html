            . You third link, the blog, gives me a security warning. Could you please replace that with an archive to protect our readers who don't use a VPN?
            <a href="https://archive.ph/zQP7S">

            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            Also, many of the links cited in that blog are broken, so it's lacking in evidentiary support. Some of the content has no support at all. Given the sketchy sourcing and security, I am a bit concerned it may be a honeypot. Therefore I am giving this our "Potential Security Risk" flair.

            Not to hijack your post , but speaking of hubs I've been digging into J Epsteins aircraft fleet , since I only have a phone to surf on , saving info for a complete post is impossible.
           </p>
           <p>
            Here's a list of aircraft he has/or still does own:
           </p>
           <p>
            N908JE
           </p>
           <p>
            N909JE
           </p>
           <p>
            N722JE
           </p>
           <p>
            N212JE
           </p>
           <p>
            N120JE
           </p>
           <p>
            and the one I've been looking into
           </p>
           <p>
            N331JE , a Bell Helicopter that flew as recently as yesterday from West Palm Brach Fla..Its supposedly owned by Hyperion Aviation which has 3 addresses listed: St Thomas, W Palm Beach and Las Vegas .Owned by one Kym Huntley , a woman who doesn't fit the profile of someone that can afford a heli.
           </p>
           <p>
            Anyhow, if anyone cares to research further and post about it, feel free.

             Kim is listed on connected investors.com with her BIO. She wants to get back into contracting work. Pic is included. She looks like a Jeff GF.And yes  She was with Hyperion LLC.
            </p>
            <p>
             The info I got above now does not come up. Actually the page crashed. Now she no longer is listed on the info just other Kim Huntleys. Odd indeed.

               I agree. I knew there was evil in this world but what we have learned here is beyond belief. Something weird about them still registered to him. Hmm. Wonder if he’s  possibly running ops from some secret location.

                Well Hyperion Air owns 2 helicopters and both have fliwn out of W Palm Beach recently,  also I just checked Open Corporates and found Ghisilane Maxwell owns Hyperion, surprise surprise.Also one Geoffrey Maxwell owns GMAX Corp (Ghisilane owns a Co. called GMAX also)in Ohio , now called Maxwell Production Co , he's a sound engineer for CP...I meant legitimate films, guessing Ghisilane has a brother.

                 So she has taken over operations? And possibly with her brother. This Kym is still a mystery as to how she figures in. All under the CIA and Mossad. Having the luxury of flying into and out of our airports.

                   Oh brother. Certainly is something sketchy and criminal between Wexner and that Co. Wexner and his wife play high society but are really into some evil stuff. A Victim claims she was raped on his property in Ohio. Possibly there is some hanky panky being arranged by Maxwell Co. in correlation with Wexners.

                     Yes I know. He also sold  her off and that’s what made her what she is today. Sickening piece of garbage for a father and a disgusting pervert for a bf. Not giving her a pass but when it’s your own dad it’s no surprise. Just like many others. She needs to be locked up as well.

Czechoslovak military assistance was both unique and crucial for the fledgling state as it battled for its existence. It was Maxwell's covert help in smuggling aircraft parts into Israel that led to the country having air superiority during their 1948 War of Independence.[42]

He had known links to the British Secret Intelligence Service (MI6), to the KGB, and to the Israeli intelligence service Mossad."

            Interesting fact here: "He found himself penning for the three leading art titles at the time Art Forum, Art Flash, Texte zur Kunst and Art presse and introduced a then unknown Jeff Koons, Martin Kippenberger, and Larry Clark to the European art world." From the wikipedia page. Jeff Koons and Larry Clark have come up quite frequently in the Rachel Chandler's friends series, don't know about Kippenberger but this is definitely interesting! Good research!

             Kippenberger died a long time ago. Would need to check the date, but maybe even before Chandler was born.
