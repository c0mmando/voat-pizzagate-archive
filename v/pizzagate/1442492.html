He was actually only under investigation for credit card fraid. Gregg went on to work for George HW Bush so clearly someone at the top killed that investigation.

<p>After reading the Pizzagate scandal details, I have to assume Spence was doing all the things we have uncovered on recently.

              Podesta teaches law and he also served  as chief of staff under Clinton and has been an advisor to numerous members of Congress. He even taught classes on judiciary investigations. He is as top level as it gets.

              Nothing about this has anything to do with being a Democrat or a Republican. This is a mindset, a way of being, a lifestyle centred around power and control and finding ever increasing ways to take yours and make it theirs. That being said, I voted for Trump. No one should care. This is solely about throngs of decent human beings opening up this seedy vile world and flooding it with bleach. Let's move on then. And yes, this is as old as our civilisations, go read about Caligula, which may actually be an important case study today.  I am quite sure we have a plentiful supply of people coming out of these insanely absurd and abusive situations all ready to step into the dead emperor's sandals. Pay attention to what made Caligula a sadomasochistic killer. Someone just posted a Passio video that should probably be pinned on this forum. It's very clear about this. Good work everyone. Refraining from knee-jerk emotional accusations and outbursts will legitimize this sub. If anyone figures out how to do that, let me know.  ;)

               Andrew Kline is DOJ in charge of Child Trafficking yet owns a Besta-Pizza, next door to ping-pong logo say "I like to fuck baby boys"

              <p>
               So you agree that Podesta is Caligula? Or at lease that almost all the politicians DNC &amp; RNC have been compromised to think that they're so above the law and untouchable that they can be gods like Caligula in this day and age?
              </p>
              <p>
               Of course this HAS nothing to do with demonCrat, or rePUGS, J Edgar Hoover was pug and fucked 1,000's of boys while controlling FBI for 50+ years, he died in office.
              </p>
              <p>
               Bush SR. ran 100's of boy's through the white house to fuck, Bush was a famous pedophile who preferred little boys to fuck.
              </p>
              <p>
               The FBI had Porn on Raygun from the 1920's that he shot in order to put food on the table, in those days grade-b actors had no choice.
              </p>
              <p>
               Caligula is alive and well in DC, and he doesn't live at comet-pizza.

                WOW, I didn't know that about Kline..This is all jaw dropping. Go to bed one day, wake up in an alternate reality the next. Imagine what we don't know. The entire tgovernment is relegated to pieces of shit. We need one of them to grow some shame and break rank

                Actually there are two lawyers named Andrew J. Kline in DC.  One has held various positions in the federal government, including at the DOJ, and is also a professor.

               <p>
                The other has represented businesses for 30 years and is also a lobbyist.  He has been affiliated with the Restaurant Association of Metropolitan Washington for over 10 years.

                It is highly likely that the second one, who represents businesses, including restaurants, is the "agent" listed on Besta Pizza.  Being the agent does not necessarily mean he is the owner.

                 IMHO Andrew Kline is MORE important BESTA-PIZZA than comet, but CIA keeps everybody's eyes on comet-pizza,

                <p>
                 It's insane to say there are 25,000  keyboard warriors on this and not one person in DC has gone to public records, make me think that 25,000 children never leave their basement.

                 It's PHYSICAL folks if you have to get off your ass if you want to play journalist and go to record keeping in person.

                <p>
                 ( NO offense to poster, but its been a month now, and still nothing is known about Andrew Kline or Besta Pizza ), yet we know the underwear size of jimmy-comet and color of the wart on his dick.

                  If you truly believe that Kline is more important and are so quick to scold others for not doing their homework, why is it that you were just spouting disinformation about them?  Because there are two Andrew Klines, and you morphed them into a single being.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  Perhaps you should follow your own advice.

              This shit has been going on since ancient times.  It has been done by people of all political ideologies and the apolitical, people of all faiths, as well as atheists, people of all colors, young and old, men and women...pick a label, ANY label, and someone sporting it has done these things.  EVERYONE needs to keep partisanship out of it.  This is about the kids.

               No its NOT about the KIDS its about the fact that AIPAC has been using kids to entrap everyone in WASH-DC since the 1960's and before that FBI under J Edgar Hoover ran pedophile sting op's.
              </p>
              <p>
               Nobody cares about the kids they're used. The public are cattle to be enslaved and their children eaten, ,raped and bled for the elite longevity.
              </p>
              <p>
               Kids under MK-ULTRA were kidnapped at birth and trained by the CIA to become sexual toys to entrap the elite, nobody in DC ares about children, except to rape them and use them for occult or financial gain.

                You are one sick mother fucker!  It makes no difference which party is in control, it has gone on, unabated, regardless.  People sporting both Rs and Ds have been implicated at various times over the years, and people in both parties sweep it under the rug.

                Factually, if we are ever going to stop it, we have to start somewhere.  And HERE is where we are at this moment in time.  We succeed here, we continue on...throughout politics, Hollywood and the music and modeling industries, in CPS, foster homes, orphanages, churches and schools...wherever it is.  But we have to fucking start somewhere.  And yes fuckhead, it IS about the kids.
