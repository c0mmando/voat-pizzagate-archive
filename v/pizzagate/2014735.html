              many of their customers are western humanitarian workers
             </strong>
             who’ve come here to help rebuild Haiti after the recent run of natural disasters...
            </p>
            <p>
             The children are told that we are a planning an underage sex party for a group of wealthy
             <strong>
              Americans and Australians

             ....

            <p>
             A meticulous operation that began with the infiltration of the dark web, and that will culminate in the take-down of high-level Haitian traffickers linked to the abuse of hundreds of school-age children....
            </p>
            <p>
             Many of them are traded, as though commodities, to rival gangs, and put up for sale or rent in filthy, underground Haitian brothels. Some are loaded into trucks or buses and
             <strong>
              smuggled across the border to be used by tourists in the Dominican Republic
             </strong>
             ....

            <p>
             All told,
             <strong>
              nine traffickers end up in handcuffs, and 30 children
             </strong>
             are placed into the care of experienced trauma counsellors....
            </p>
           </blockquote>
           <p>
            If recent history is our guide, expect most, if not all of those "in handcuffs" to slip away.

             The spokeswoman for the commissioner’s office, Substitute Commissioner Mirlande D. Prévost, who was present at Sunday’s police operation,
             <strong>
              initially reported that 18 adults tied to the child-trafficking ring had been arrested.

             By that evening, Commissioner Leger had, and
             <strong>
              has since, been saying 12 adults were arrested.

             By Monday morning, in an interview with Marie Lucie Bonhomme Opont of Vision 2000, police spokesman, Inspector Gary Desrosiers,
             <strong>
              said 9 had been arrested.

              the foreign participants somehow escaped.
             </strong>
             None the less, he congratulated the police units which participated in the sting at Kaliko Beach Club. Senator Senatus said the
             <strong>
              first information he received was that foreigners were involved in the child-trafficking.

             Great post kestrel9. You should consider taking your comment and making an entire post about it.

             There is a definite pattern of these fake human trafficking arrests. Most if not all are for show. When people are sent to jail it's invariably the lowest on the totem pole who go away. No high level perps have been busted yet.
            </p>
            <p>
             I'm praying Trump grows a pair of balls but I'm not holding my breath. I think there will be high level arrests. I'm almost positive Hillary Clinton and John Podesta are going to get flushed down the toilet but it's going to be for classified emails and weapons trafficking respectively. No human trafficking will be mentioned.

              Thanks for feedback... after some reading about orphanages and illegal adoptions it's clear "It Takes a Global Village of NGOs" to enable, conduct, cover-up, profit from child exploitation and human trafficking.  I agree with your sentiments that they (Clintons and friends) won't get nailed for the trafficking, we'll just be seeing the repeating busts of small names as the Global trafficking franchises continue without much trouble.

            I must counter what this group is doing and who the possibility are.  Please see this thread
            <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/v/pizzagate/2014220">
             https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/2014220

            There is proof and discussion against what this group may be.  It is a lively discussion and we should consider it.

            Operation Underground Railroad is certainly a wonderful org.  I read the whole article and these people are so caring and dedicated to helping the children of Haiti.  The children after being freed after a sting are taken to a safe house and eventually go to school to learn and dance and sing.  But this is a hard push.  I read there are 32K children in orphanages in Haiti (in another article on here).  But this is a happy beginning. Thank you
