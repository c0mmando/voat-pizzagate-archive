            Both Howard University Hospital and George Washington University Hospital have Level 1 trauma Centers. Such hospitals are not always located on campus. The university will have one origin,  the hospital another and decades later they can merge administratively. The hospital he was taken to may have been dictated by the address he gave, sort of a jurisdictional thing. I didnt read the entire report. Did it provide some discussion as to where Seth should have gone?  Edit:  There needs to be a highly visible reward offered for any information about his hospitalization, not just info leading to a conviction. The cops aren't doing their job, the public will have to do it for them.

            Profiling project said they can confirm Seth was taken to George Washington University Hospital. I call BS and starting to think they are providing disinfo. Medstar per mapquest is only 3 minutes from where Seth rich was shot and has a trauma center that would have been perfectly capable of attending to him. Look at how they took in Scalise and treated his gun shot woulda. That couldn't have happened at Howard University as they confirmed they have no trauma center.  If you look at the length to drive from the site of the shooting to George Washington university, it's 17 mins!!!! Why would they skip a closer and capable hospital to drive an additional 14 mins to a further hospital?
           </p>
           <p>
            One guy from profiling project that was speaking said they did not know which hospital he was shot at. Then right after, the head of the project took over the mic to confirm they "know" which hospital he was sent to. He said it was George Washington university hospital and he knows because some lady who feared for her life said he was at that hospital. That's his proof? Are you kidding me!? This guy investigating the murder of Seth Rich is out confirming the hospital because some lady told him so. He gave absolutely no proof aside from the fact she was afraid to tell him and feared for her life? I wonder if they are trying to shift attention out of medstar due to recent findings. Hmm...the parents can settle all this right now. Sad to see them so quiet in all this
