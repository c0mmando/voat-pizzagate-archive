            I do believe this is related to PG in that the change in world thinking that is mentioned is talking about the "perversions" that we are being aclimated to (the 10 new perversions?) This change is necessary for their "revelation of the method" from Alice Bailey and the rest of their sick cabal. Don't know if this help prevent this thread from being removed but I think this was a good post.

            Eustace is the man.  He knew so many details about the history (especially the 20th century) of how we have come to this point (including, why child abuse is often key to controlling geopolitical leaders).  His work on the Fed is unparalleled. He worked with McCarthy briefly, worked with Ezra Pound, and came in contact and knew details about many other important (good and bad) people from the 1940s to 2000ish

            (twitter) falsely accuses me of posting child porn to voat. This is to distract from the fact Voat hosts pedo forums. It was all getting exposed wasn't it? The day I was banned. Too much. I have been calling it out but was on to it from the start. I politely wrote with questions to ATIF COLO abt it, no reply. STANKY.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
I did not post child porn, I posted a screenshot hosted by imgbb as all my screenshots are that are loaded to voat, and it was a screenshot of a Twitter accnt that followed my Twitter account.&lt;br&gt;

I posted the screenshot of the follower I received after using hashtag PANCAKEDAY as an EXPOSE. Of the way Twitter uses the top trending board to message pedophiles!!! And that PANCAKEDAY means little flat chest child to these perpetrators.

Days are numbered, he has your ip and machine id"my arse. Isn't that against your own rules. Oh but your liars so nothing matters here. That's fine.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
  Anyone who says I post child porn  is living human waste and a sick demented liar. I won't take that bullshit at all. I will spread this knowledge abt the pedo hiding spaces, pedo talking codes and pedo protectors where I find it. And heaven help those who try to use God's name in vain against me. My vision my path is righteousness and golden life for children. Children are gold children first.&lt;br&gt;

             , a pic of a man's dick being inserted in the vagina of a little girl like you posted before you were banned, reported to the admins, and reported to LE is definitely child porn.

              by ur name I wonder...but look for your self I won't click open any of it. Go to search voat if you cant find that on the site like I couldn't you can Google search voat andbitbwill give you the search bar. Then type in jailbait. Regarding what I posted about the top trending hashtag board being a message board for pedos on Twitter and the image of the follower I got was from using hashtag PANCAKEDAY. I posted the followers acount to make a point about Twitter soliciting child porn via use of the hashtags.after I reported it to FBI. What would be a dick in vagina is a detail, but that has no bodies attached. There's no torso, nor hips it's just a dick going in a hole you cannot tell if that's a little girl or adult being penetrated. Or a man. The links are blocked out. This is ridiculous that I am defending myself to PORN PERPETRATORS YOU KNOW WHAT YOU HAVE IN THIS SITE. SHAME ON YOU!
GOD PROTECT US FROM THIS TYPE OF TRICKERY!!!!!!
             </p>
             <p>
              The point that I am making, is that I was on to the code, together if the post weren't removed it could have actually been possible to bust at least a few pedos peddling their wares on Twitter.
             </p>
             <p>

             <p>
              VERY odd!!! So I looked at what they are hiding on voat.
             </p>
             <p>
              Yep indeed. PEDO shit. And they are all about it. They know all about it all this time.
             </p>
             <p>
              Meaning the mods know very well and

             </p>
             <p>
              found out abt the pedo subs the day nameof was banned. I was nameof. The post listed alot more than just jailbait but I was too busy to read it.
             </p>
             <p>
              Although i was banned from Pizzagate only. Im sure that indicator fucked with my password so I cold no longer log on to voat at all from any device. Hence namodam.
             </p>
             <p>
              Now I see the mods have written to me on the hour I shit you not &amp;, i can't post cause they got some kind of 24 hour ban on me Them talking about reporting me to Law Enforcement Is Good cause then the FBI will take care of all the pedo subs on voat!
             </p>

              What I posted was a screenshot of a Twitter account page that followed my Twitter account! THE POST I MADE I MARKED NSFW!!! I said it's safe because it was as far as toxic links. The warning was there as far as graphicly.
             </p>
             <p>
              And by the way, the image is not "as child porn as you can get" what garbage spout.

              Twitter feed and find it, it's posted to him there repeatedly and as I say it's not an illegal image. His handle is

             </p>
             <p>
              Remember the issue is that I found a pedophile code being used on twitter, that's the info that's getting shut out.
             </p>
             <p>
              I've posted that screenshot everywhere now as sort of a voat meme Right beside the post indicator finger gave me that Threatens me about having my ip AND MACHINE ID &amp; he says that my says are numbered.
             </p>
             <p>
              When i posted, it was taken down for having links within the screenshot to child porn, I was told. SO I covered the links with photo editor!!
             </p>
             <p>
              I reposted it .
             </p>
             <p>
              My post was talking about Twitter top trending hashtags as messages and that hashtag pancake day =  flatchested child
             </p>
             <p>
              That's what im banned for. Catching Twitter using code then voat shuts my post down.
             </p>
             <p>
              WHY WOULD pizzagate vOAT mods DO THAT? Mods r saying I posted a rape image. Lie. There's a detail on the image that shows a phallus penetrating an orifice. No one can say how old the orifice is or if it make or female.
             </p>
             <p>
              There is a reason for the compulsive behaviour maybe why

              NOT here anymore. Voat harbors huge pedophile community. Pizzagate is their learning board. These people think they  are smart.
             </p>
             <p>
              JAILBAITANON voat is only one pedo subforums here. I've  been taking lots and lots of screenshots and posting them to the FBI too.
             </p>
             <p>
              So anyway anyone who says I post child porn is living human waste.
             </p>
             <p>

              Think logically. There's a small group of LOYAL ppl who mod and post to pizzagate voat, post on voat, and use voat as a psychological tool. Pizzagate is a tool.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;  VOAT IS NEITHER SAFE FOR KIDS NOR OPEN TO FREE SPEECH THAT IS THE HOAX.

              What's real is I don't have alts, and I don't block people.

So please call me it. I don't have ALTS and I don't block anyone. Those options are for wimps I guess that's not my style. I want to confront this bullshit face first. No I did not post child porn.

               None of that gives you the right to post childporn here. Common sense should tell you that you can’t post images of a little girl with a penis in her vagina. We don’t want to see that and it’s illegal. It doesn’t matter if you marked it NSFW. It was still childporn.

              by ur name I wonder...but look for your self I won't click open any of it. Go to search voat if you cant find that on the site like I couldn't you can Google search voat andbitbwill give you the search bar. Then type in jailbait. Regarding what I posted about the top trending hashtag board being a message board for pedos on Twitter and the image of the follower I got was from using hashtag PANCAKEDAY. I posted the followers acount to make a point about Twitter soliciting child porn via use of the hashtags.after I reported it to FBI. What would be a dick in vagina is a detail, but that has no bodies attached. There's no torso, nor hips it's just a dick going in a hole you cannot tell if that's a little girl or adult being penetrated. Or a man. The links are blocked out. This is ridiculous that I am defending myself to PORN PERPETRATORS YOU KNOW WHAT YOU HAVE IN THIS SITE. SHAME ON YOU!
GOD PROTECT US FROM THIS TYPE OF TRICKERY!!!!!!
             </p>
             <p>
              The point that I am making, is that I was on to the code, together if the post weren't removed it could have actually been possible to bust at least a few pedos peddling their wares on Twitter.
             </p>
             <p>
              It made NO SENSE to try to say I was intending as stupid

              keeps sayinh to get people into pressing CP links.
             </p>
             <p>
              VERY odd!!! So I looked at what they are hiding on voat.
             </p>
             <p>
              Yep indeed. PEDO shit. And they are all about it. They know all about it all this time.
             </p>
             <p>
              Meaning the mods know very well and

              ...said something weird to me, ill go find it...I wonder if they fired mf cause he hated the child predators chat subs on voat?
             </p>
             <p>
              found out abt the pedo subs the day nameof was banned. I was nameof. The post listed alot more than just jailbait but I was too busy to read it.
             </p>
             <p>
              Although i was banned from Pizzagate only. Im sure that indicator fucked with my password so I cold no longer log on to voat at all from any device. Hence namodam.
             </p>
             <p>
              Now I see the mods have written to me on the hour I shit you not &amp;, i can't post cause they got some kind of 24 hour ban on me Them talking about reporting me to Law Enforcement Is Good cause then the FBI will take care of all the pedo subs on voat!
             </p>
             <p>
              Please do!

              Wow, lame a terrorist threat. Not worried. I never posted child porn.
             </p>
             <p>
              Just depressing to spend a year talking to folks who harbor child porn in the style of true creeps, in front of everyone's face. That's how its done by LUCIFERIANS.

              I WROTE TO YOU ABT THIS AND NEVER HEARD BACK. I asked abt the pedo subs no reply.
             </p>
             <p>
              What I posted was a screenshot of a Twitter account page that followed my Twitter account! THE POST I MADE I MARKED NSFW!!! I said it's safe because it was as far as toxic links. The warning was there as far as graphicly.
             </p>
             <p>
              And by the way, the image is not "as child porn as you can get" what garbage spout.
             </p>
             <p>
              go to

               @VINDICATORS
              </a>
              Twitter feed and find it, it's posted to him there repeatedly and as I say it's not an illegal image. His handle is
              <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/user/vindic8tr">
               @vindic8tr
              </a>
              and if it were illegal it would be an issue. And it's not except for here in Voat.
             </p>
             <p>
              Remember the issue is that I found a pedophile code being used on twitter, that's the info that's getting shut out.
             </p>
             <p>
              I've posted that screenshot everywhere now as sort of a voat meme Right beside the post indicator finger gave me that Threatens me about having my ip AND MACHINE ID &amp; he says that my says are numbered.
             </p>
             <p>
              When i posted, it was taken down for having links within the screenshot to child porn, I was told. SO I covered the links with photo editor!!
             </p>
             <p>
              I reposted it .
             </p>
             <p>
              My post was talking about Twitter top trending hashtags as messages and that hashtag pancake day =  flatchested child &lt;br&gt; That's what im banned for. Catching Twitter using code then voat shuts my post down.  &lt;br&gt;
             </p>
             <p>
              WHY WOULD pizzagate vOAT mods DO THAT? Miss r saying I posted a rape image. Lie. There's a detail on the image that shows a phallus penetrating an orifice. No one can say how old the orifice is or if it make or female.
             </p>
             <p>
              There is a reason for the compulsive behaviour maybe why

              NOT here anymore. Voat harbors huge pedophile community. Pizzagate is their learning board. These people think they  are smart. &lt;br&gt;
             </p>
             <p>
              JAILBAITANON voat  b is only one pedo subforums here. I've  been taking lots and lots of screenshots and posting them to the FBI too. &lt;br&gt;
             </p>
             <p>
              So anyway anyone who says I post child porn is living human waste.&lt;br&gt;
             </p>
             <p>

             <p>
              Think logically. There's a small group of LOYAL ppl who mod and post to pizzagate voat, post on voat, and use voat as a psychological tool. Pizzagate is a tool.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;  VOAT IS NEITHER SAFE FOR KIDS NOR OPEN TO FREE SPEECH THAT IS THE HOAX.

             <p>
              What's real is I don't have alts, and I don't block people.  This may change because Now that vindy &amp; scrazy have banned me from several forums for raising my voice against the false disgusting lie that I posted CP, since then I can't log on from any other device. Says it doesn't know me. SO NAMODAM IS WHO I AM NOW. Thanks Better name.

              3.Right millenialfalcon got the boot and that was heads up to me that things were weird. The name namodam came to me last night, but guess what it's not my alt it's my new name. So please call me it. I don't have ALTS and I don't block anyone. Those options are for wimps I guess that's not my style. I want to confront this bullshit face first. No I did not post child porn. I am just a little bit offended by that and I won't settle for it from a site that harbors sheist like this

              Your deflection is so meaningless and shallow regarding the paranoid alt situation. In light of the cold cold evil it takes to ignore the fact I BRING FORWARD: VOAT HOSTS THIS TYPE OF SEXUALLY SADO PREDATORY TOWARD kids chat and pic trade forums

             <p>
              You've done it. You have ignored child sexualization on Voat, and focused a weak lame attack on My Name/character. Grooooosss! You. Voat. Grrrr

               Their previous alt - 'nameof' has already been banned for posting child porn.
              </p>
              <p>
               We don't ban per IP addresses (unfortunately), so they were able to come back with a new alt. Unless they do something which gives us reasons for a new ban, we cannot ban the new alt.

              You may have seen this already. Also, “Education to Slavery” is mentioned, but there is no link. I hope to find it in a print version.

              I think you may be correct.  They want to kill this book of his for some reason.  I was searching and found Murder by Injection and it should be required reading by all.  It will save lives for sure.  I am going to find it somewhere else because I hate Bleeping amazon but here is a piece by the NYT on amazon and it is amazing.  Please Read the Comments for there is Amazing Info on how we are being lied to by the AMA and one of the starters was a man who was a kind of pimp.
              <a href="https://www.amazon.ca/Murder-Injection-Eustace-Clarence-Mullins/dp/1911417002">

              I cannot recommend this book any more strongly fr all.  I really care about my members here and hope you look at it. You will never be more grateful.  I am in shock.   I will search the book out somewhere else.

                Let me know what you think after you read those comments.  I am going to try to get that book.  No wonder they are scrubbing info about the Education of Slavery.  Well, complete revolution in World Thinking.  Well guess what, even though they have brainwashed some, there has been a backlash in that dept.  There are so many Woke now I would think they are in a kind of panic mode.  We can possibly get the paperbacks of these and hand them out to friends and relatives.  If I find a hard cover, I will not let it out of my sight.

               Thanks Carmencita. Yes that book is very good as well. 
i believe both EDUCATION FOR SLAVERY and a text called EASTER are completely missing from the web. I believe he hit a nerve with them. Let me know if you find them. EASTER relates to the cult of Ishtar which was mainly about child sacrifice.

                Remember the movie Ishtar?  It starred Warren Beatty.  I should look into this.  Yes if I find Anything on either one will let you know  After reading about the AMA and this book I can see why they wanted to Erase those books and all memory of them.  There must be some people with these books in their hands.  Somewhere.

            Eustace Mullins: "It has never gone away. It's more prevalent today, I think, than it was in Jesus' time. And, of course, this really gets conspiratorial because, when your education system has been subverted by a Satanic cult -- you don't get much more conspiratorial than that"

             "THE EDUCATION WHICH MAKES FOR PEACE. When will wars really stop in the world's history? As soon as a new ideal of education is realised. What is this new ideal of education which makes for peace? I will give it in one word:Panhumanism. This word includes all I wish to say. Individualism means a brick, Panhumanism means a building. Even the greatest individuality (may it be Cæsar, or Raphael, or Luther) is no more than a brick in the panhuman building of history. The lives of individuals are only the points, whereas the life of mankind is a form, a deep, high and large form. If a great and original individuality were the aim of history, I think history should stop with the first man upon
earth, for our first ancestor must have been the most striking individual who ever existed. Men coming after
Adam have been like their parents and each other. Kaiser William is not such an interesting and striking a
creature by far as the first man was. When Kaiser William opens his mouth to speak, he speaks words that are
known. When he moves or sits, when he eats or praysall that is anuance only of what other people do, all is
either from heritage or imitation, and quite an insignificant amount is individual. Whereas every sound that
the first man uttered was quite new for the Universe; every movement striking and dramatic; every look of his
eyes was discovering new worlds; every joy or sorrow violently felt; every struggle a great accumulation of
experiences. And so forth. Well, if one striking individuum is the aim of history, history should close with the
death of Adam. But history still continues. Why? Just because not Adam was its aim, but mankind; not one, or
two, or ten heroes, but millions of human creatures; not some few great men, but all men, all together, all
without exception.
From this point of view we get the true ideal of education. The purpose of education is not to make grand personalities, but to make bricks for the building, i.e., to make suitable members of a collective body and suitable workers of a collective work.THE EDUCATION WHICH MAKES FOR PEACE.
