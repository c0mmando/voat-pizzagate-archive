<strong>The Hard Truth: Is There Any Real Evidence Of Elite Pedophile Sex Rings Involving Government &amp; Pop Culture?</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Pedophiles are people with a sexual attraction to children (which is known as pedophilia). This differs from those who have sexually abused a child (which is known as child rape). One is a sexual attraction and those with it, and no one chooses their sexual attractions. The other are those who have made a choice to hurt a child.
Pedophilia is not synonymous with child sexual abuse. Pedophiles are not synonymous with child rapists.
If CE hopes to showcase intelligent discussion and investigations on these topics, they would do well to keep the two groups of people, as well as the attraction and the behavior, separate. This author has failed to think critically about this issue.

<p>The \'advocate\' post several more comments explaining why pedophiles are not child rapists in a clear attempt to begin the normalization of pedophilia.  There are only a few comments on there so it is easy to find these if you care to see how they will try to do this.</p>',

            So what they are saying is it's ok to watch child porn, which makes you at pedophile, As long as you don't do the raping, because if you act on your attraction, you are now a child rapist?

            The only ones who would believe this shit are pedophiles,

            no one chooses their sexual attractions.

            It's like saying they would never ever touch a child, but only look at CP (totally ignoring the fact that a child was abused for them to get off on their sick fantasies).

            God they love to lie.  Child rape is committed by Pedophiles. If you rape a child you are a Pedophile.  Plain and simple.
