<p>And until members of Congress have the courage to step forward and call it by its name - child sexual abuse - we will continue to fail thousands of at-risk military children and families who deserve better</p>
<p>The Military Family PROTECT Act proposes to strengthen the military\'s handling and prosecution of child abuse and domestic violence claims. </p>
<p>The bill\'s sponsors argue these provisions will help &quot;ensure that every base and every military region has a plan and the tools they need to fight these horrific crimes.&quot;</p>
<p>Yet the bill overlooks the specific problem of child sexual abuse in the military, and offers no plan to attack it head-on.  
</p>
<p>Hundreds of military children are sexually abused every year and the military is doing little about it</p>
<p>. An Associated Press (AP) investigation found there were nearly 1,600 &quot;substantiated&quot; sexual abuse cases of military dependents between 2010 and 2014. </p>
<p>The AP concluded that assault and rape cases among kids on military bases &quot;often die on the desks of prosecutors, even when an attacker confesses.&quot;</p>
<p>In other cases, criminal prosecutors &quot;shelve them,&quot; the AP found, &quot;despite requirement they be pursued.&quot;  
</p>
<p>The Pentagon\'s silent response to these startling statistics of military child sexual abuse is troubling.</p>
<p>The Department of Defense (DoD) has allocated little, if any, resources to monitor it, and has implemented no known educational or training programs to try and prevent it.</p>
<p>The AP went even further, asserting that the &quot;Pentagon does not know the scope of the problem and does little to track it.&quot;</p>
<p>And yet the warning signs of child sexual abuse on military bases are painfully obvious. </p>
<p>More inmates are locked up in military prisons for it than for any other crime, the AP found. And 90 percent of all child sexual abuse cases involve a person known or trusted by the child, where the opportunity for abusers to groom children in a military environment is magnified, due to the close living quarters and relationships many military families share.</p>
<p>We can\'t afford to have this same mindset when it involves the welfare of military children. </p>
<p>We must break the silence associated with &quot;child sexual abuse&quot; and pursue tangible solutions that can prevent it from happening. </p>
<p>Members of Congress have a unique opportunity to lead by example. They can use this moment to confront this issue in the Military Family PROTECT Act, and right a terrible wrong that continues to impact children everywhere on U.S. military bases.</p>
<p>Or lawmakers can stay in their comfort zones and look the other way - where they refuse to reach across the aisle to find common political ground to protect families from child sexual abuse - and be left with some serious soul searching to do.</p>

            How about Kinsey and the cases listed in some of Dave McGowan's Programmed to Kill. Didn't Cathy O'Brien talk about compromised military officers that sold the children into slavery? Masons indeed-the guilty covering/enabling the guilty .

            The military are like the Masons, they cover each other's back. Fort Huachuca,AZ, site of the US Army Military Intelligence Center, has a population to registered sex offender ratio of 178:1 while near by Sierra Vista has 947:1. And that's just part of the picture as a lot of states are behind on their sex offender registration. And many states allow offenders who haven't offended after a while to be dropped or the offender can petition after so many years to be dropped from registration. So then you have the situations where for example a Naval Lt.Commander who in 1982 was sentenced to 5 years in Leavenworth for 19 counts of molesting military children is no longer on the sex offender lists and was allegedly able to run a day school in 1986!

            Rape of adult women is also rampant and has been for decades.  It's also silenced and rarely if ever gets exposed.

            Children do not have a voice globally.  For a reason !
People are so afraid to address the issue afraid of what will happen next.   But They know it happens.   Take a look at the naval capt who is facing charges for such.

            I can't even.  Thanks for posting this.  UPVOAT!  Miss Goody 2 Shoes trying to save her neck when the NXIVM stuff hits her dad.  OH YES there is a lot of sexual abuse of children on military bases.  We have had it posted here.  They always skirt the issue, just barely touching it.  Sexual Abuse.  Yes but to WHOM?  Our Children.

            U.S. soldiers and contractors have not been prosecuted for sexually abusing Colombian girls because of diplomatic immunity.
           </p>
           <p>
            U.S. soldiers and military contractors sexually abused at least 54 children between 2003 and 2007, according to a report commissioned by the Colombian government and the FARC.
           </p>
           <p>
            ​“There is abundant information about the sexual violence, which ocurred under absolute impunity because of the bilateral agreements and the diplomatic immunity of United States officials,” said Renan Vega of the Pedagogic University in Bogota, who helped write the report.
           </p>
           <p>
            Vega detailed a case in 2004 in which military contractors sexually abused 54 girls and filmed [the abuse] and sold the films as pornographic material. The families of the victims received death threats and the victims fled the central Colombian town of Melgar.
           </p>
           <p>
            The report also reveals that in 2007 U.S. Arrmy Sergeant Michael J. Coen and defense contractor Cesar Ruiz drugged and raped a 12-year-old girl inside their military base. Prosecution officials were not allowed to arrest the alleged rapists because of the immunity agreements between the U.S. military and Colombia.
           </p>
           <p>
            Coen and Ruiz were flown out of the country and were never indicted in the U.S. The victim and her family were forced to flee from the region because people linked to the suspects were threatening them.
           </p>
           <p>
            According to news agency El Turbion, “In 2006 there were 23 reported cases of sexual abuse committed by active American soldiers and another 14 in 2007.”
           </p>
           <p>
            The 800-page report was commissioned by the government and the FARC rebel group to ascertain the causes and breadth of the 50-year internal conflict as part of the historic peace talks between the two sides.
           </p>
           <p>
            Here we are on the front page lol :)    What they are trying to spread is that there is child on child sexual abuse at mil. bases.  They are going to push the blame on the children?  They are really going too far this time.  Kids taking the Wrap for big grown men.  Disgusting.

              Yeah, they are really getting desperate.  OR they are turning them into little pedos.  Heavily Raping Them and then they do the same and they will have more CP.  I can't believe I just typed that.  I can't believe my mind can come up with things like that.  But that's how they are.  As Evil As Can Be.
