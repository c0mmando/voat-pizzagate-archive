<p>Instead of bouncing from topic to topic inside of Pedogate, I want to continue examining the situation in Haiti. In my previous post, I described how DynCorp has sizable contracts with the State Department and USAID for training and supporting the HNP (PNH) force. DynCorp has essentially completely integrated itself into the national police force, is involved with prison construction projects and its affiliate partners have large contracts to ‘help draft’ legislation in the Caribbean.</p>
<p>George Webb (Day 86 to 88 – Where is Eric Braverman?) has been focusing more and more of his investigation on Haiti and has illustrated that many of the new construction projects are in the norther region of the country. The Clinton Foundations Caracol Industrial park is located in this area.</p>
<p>USAID is involved with many of the new construction projects in the region both completed and those that are still in development. George Webb mentions the new deep water port that will operate out of Fort Liberte. Fort Liberte is also the name of the new prison at the location. An ironic and unfortunate name for a prison to say the least.</p>
<p><a href="https://i.imgtc.com/F2P9LPo.pngPNG">https://i.imgtc.com/F2P9LPo.pngPNG</a></p>
<p>State Department / USAID records show that there are a number of prison projects that were scheduled for completion in late 2016 and into 2017.</p>

<p>It is difficult to determine the exact locations of the prison construction sites as they do not appear on Google maps, but simply searching the names we can locate their approximate locations.</p>

<p>Prison Civile at Cap Haitian (already in existence), and Fort Liberte are located in the northern region surrounding Caracol Industrial Park (CIP). There is an area directly south of CIP called Cabaret, however there is another location named Cabaret not far to the north of Port-au-Prince, so there are two possible sites. <a href="https://i.imgtc.com/y4SB7Wu.pngPNG">https://i.imgtc.com/y4SB7Wu.pngPNG</a></p>

<p>The prison will house 300 inmates. It will also have an infirmary and an administration building. The company that was awarded the $5.6 million construction contract is DFS Construction LLC. There is very little about the US based company online but I was able to find some basic information.</p>
<p><a href="https://i.imgtc.com/uaLXlf6.pngPNG">https://i.imgtc.com/uaLXlf6.pngPNG</a></p>
<p>According to the website, DFS construction specializes in non-residential construction and is based out of Annapolis, Maryland. The company headquarters is located close to the US Naval Academy.</p>

Here’s where things get interesting.</p>
<p>With a little more digging I found this receipt tracking a freight order from UAE to DFS Construction LL in the US. The shipment container was sent from the Dubai and reached the US in NY port.</p>
<p><a href="https://i.imgtc.com/7o36H2j.pngPNG">https://i.imgtc.com/7o36H2j.pngPNG</a></p>
<p>What was being shipped from Dubai to New York was noted as equipment and tools, but something else caught my attention - the details concerning the companies found on the receipt.</p>
<pre><code>The Shipper: DFS Construction LLC
The Shipper’s Address: DFS Middle East (Dubai, UAE)
Consignee: Diplomat Freight Services
</code></pre>

<p>When I was researching DFS construction there were a number of companies with similar names so i wanted to verify if DFS construction LLC. had any relation to Diplomat Freight Services.</p>
<p>Turns out they share the exact same address in Annapolis Maryland.</p>
<p><a href="https://i.imgtc.com/lMQcBuS.pngPNG">https://i.imgtc.com/lMQcBuS.pngPNG</a>

<p>DFS is not simply a non-residential construction company but it is the center of a worldwide network of freight shipping services. DFS provides a wide range of services by land, sea and air.</p>

There\'s something very unsettling about having children displayed on pages for a freight shipping and prison construction company.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, there is no information on the website that would identify company executives or members of the board of directors. The only name I’ve uncovered that are related to the company in anyway is the only name that appears on the shipping receipt from the UAE to New York – Rich Alford.
How is this relevant?</p>
<p>DFS is the company contracted to complete the Fort Liberte prison, yet the company is more than just a construction company. They are a shipping company, with a wide range of capabilities and a worldwide network.
Could DFS be part of a human trafficking network?</p>
<p>It seems as though they are in a position to support human trafficking from the Forte Liberte site. They have a holding ground ( the prison) and Fort Liberte is being developed as a deep water port that will be able to ship/receive just about anything. DFS has offices in: Haiti, UAE, Columbia, London, California, Annapolis, Ireland, Canada, Australia, Uganda and whole host of other countries.</p>
<p><a href="https://i.imgtc.com/iIt88xo.pngPNG">https://i.imgtc.com/iIt88xo.pngPNG</a>
Does DFS Have Diplomatic Immunity?</p>
<p>If Diplomat Freight Services has Diplomatic immunity for even some of its freight cargo it would be quite a revelation. Diplomatic Immunity would mean that cargo shipped to or from diplomats is not subject to searches by custom agents and law enforcement.</p>
<p>According to the ACLU</p>
<pre><code>The ability of diplomats and the staff of international organizations to cloak themselves with diplomatic immunity encourages their abusive practices and can present a significant legal hurdle to women workers seeking to assert their rights in U.S. courts. Why do some diplomats and staff of international organizations have immunity? • Diplomats have immunity to civil and criminal jurisdiction under the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations of 1961.The Vienna Convention grants diplomats, the family of diplomats, and the administrative, technical and service staff of embassies and international organizations various levels of immunity from the laws of the foreign state in which they reside. While there are various justifications for diplomatic immunity, the most accepted justification is that diplomatic immunity is a functional necessity and that it would be impossible for diplomats to fulfill their duties without such privileges.
</code></pre>

<p>Diplomatic Immunity is an important part of international relations. Diplomatic immunity is a form of legal immunity that ensures diplomats are given safe passage and are considered not susceptible to lawsuit or prosecution under the host country\'s laws, although they can still be expelled. Therefore, a diplomat cannot be arrested or detained.</p>
<p>There is such a thing as a diplomatic pouch, basically it is a bag carried by a diplomat that is often locked by key. According to international law and practices, authorities are prohibited from searching the contents of the diplomatic pouch. There are many cases of abuse of diplomatic immunity which I will not get into but I raise the issue because there are also situations where diplomatic immunity can be applied to shipping cargo.</p>
<p>The US State Department issued this notice regarding – Diplomatic Cargo Shipments</p>
<p><a href="https://www.state.gov/ofm/resource/imp/roinfo/ny/20947.htm">https://www.state.gov/ofm/resource/imp/roinfo/ny/20947.htm</a></p>
<p>The notice outlines the general rules for cargo and advices on certain methods that can be used to ‘reduce inspections’. The important thing here is, however, that diplomatic cargo shipments do indeed exist. If diplomats are involved in human trafficking it is possible to claim diplomatic immunity on cargo shipments. Perhaps diplomatic immunity is irrelevant when the Haitian National Police force is already trained and integrated with the contractor DynCorp. However, there is a parallel with DynCorp as the two companies have extensive aviation and transportation capacities.</p>
<p>So, regardless if DFS has the ability to claim immunity or not, the company remains an interesting player operating at a key location within Haiti. Another piece of the puzzle. The picture is still murky but the further we go the clearer it becomes.</p>

           There's something very unsettling about having children displayed on pages for a freight shipping and prison construction company.
          </p>
          <p>
           Unfortunately, there is no information on the website that would identify company executives or members of the board of directors. The only name I’ve uncovered that are related to the company in anyway is the only name that appears on the shipping receipt from the UAE to New York – Rich Alford.
How is this relevant?
          </p>
          <p>
           DFS is the company contracted to complete the Fort Liberte prison, yet the company is more than just a construction company. They are a shipping company, with a wide range of capabilities and a worldwide network.
Could DFS be part of a human trafficking network?
          </p>
          <p>
           It seems as though they are in a position to support human trafficking from the Forte Liberte site. They have a holding ground ( the prison) and Fort Liberte is being developed as a deep water port that will be able to ship/receive just about anything. DFS has offices in: Haiti, UAE, Columbia, London, California, Annapolis, Ireland, Canada, Australia, Uganda and whole host of other countries.

           Does DFS Have Diplomatic Immunity?
          </p>
          <p>
           If Diplomat Freight Services has Diplomatic immunity for even some of its freight cargo it would be quite a revelation. Diplomatic Immunity would mean that cargo shipped to or from diplomats is not subject to searches by custom agents and law enforcement.
          </p>
          <p>
           According to the ACLU
          </p>
          <pre><code>The ability of diplomats and the staff of international organizations to cloak themselves with diplomatic immunity encourages their abusive practices and can present a significant legal hurdle to women workers seeking to assert their rights in U.S. courts. Why do some diplomats and staff of international organizations have immunity? • Diplomats have immunity to civil and criminal jurisdiction under the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations of 1961.The Vienna Convention grants diplomats, the family of diplomats, and the administrative, technical and service staff of embassies and international organizations various levels of immunity from the laws of the foreign state in which they reside. While there are various justifications for diplomatic immunity, the most accepted justification is that diplomatic immunity is a functional necessity and that it would be impossible for diplomats to fulfill their duties without such privileges.
</code></pre>
          <p>
           Diplomatic Immunity is an important part of international relations. Diplomatic immunity is a form of legal immunity that ensures diplomats are given safe passage and are considered not susceptible to lawsuit or prosecution under the host country's laws, although they can still be expelled. Therefore, a diplomat cannot be arrested or detained.
          </p>
          <p>
           There is such a thing as a diplomatic pouch, basically it is a bag carried by a diplomat that is often locked by key. According to international law and practices, authorities are prohibited from searching the contents of the diplomatic pouch. There are many cases of abuse of diplomatic immunity which I will not get into but I raise the issue because there are also situations where diplomatic immunity can be applied to shipping cargo.
          </p>
          <p>
           The US State Department issued this notice regarding – Diplomatic Cargo Shipments
          </p>
          <p>
           <a href="https://www.state.gov/ofm/resource/imp/roinfo/ny/20947.htm">
            https://www.state.gov/ofm/resource/imp/roinfo/ny/20947.htm
           </a>
          </p>
          <p>
           The notice outlines the general rules for cargo and advices on certain methods that can be used to ‘reduce inspections’. The important thing here is, however, that diplomatic cargo shipments do indeed exist. If diplomats are involved in human trafficking it is possible to claim diplomatic immunity on cargo shipments. Perhaps diplomatic immunity is irrelevant when the Haitian National Police force is already trained and integrated with the contractor DynCorp. However, there is a parallel with DynCorp as the two companies have extensive aviation and transportation capacities.
          </p>
          <p>
           So, regardless if DFS has the ability to claim immunity or not, the company remains an interesting player operating at a key location within Haiti. Another piece of the puzzle. The picture is still murky but the further we go the clearer it becomes.
