            I have not been here in a while due to the fact i have emigrated to thegreatawakening sub on reddit. This sub is focuses heavily on Q drops and basically does what you guy's do here, but there are over 50,000 members and it's he most active sub on Reddit. I know alot of you are sceptical of Q but regardless, Q has brought to the attention everything which we have been investigating for years. It really did blow my mind to see people making Laura silsby links to the Clinton Foundation etc, info which had been on voat for a long time. I was just ecstatic to see the info you guys had dug up finally get the recognition it deserves.
           </p>
           <p>
            What you guys have to realise if you didnt already, is that these elite peado scumbags are involved in every type of corruption you can think of and Q is basically drip feeding the info to everyone slowly, it's a hell of alot to take in. If you haven't joined the sub already i really hope you do, they could really do with the experience and knowledge of the voat crew on there telling them what you already know.

             That sub is focused on Q and pizzagate. I run it, and am a mod on pizzagate. So we stay connected, ping each other and share information with each other. Some users don’t like it. But many are waking up. Regardless, Q has taken pizzagate mainstream!

             Which is EXACTLY why I want to keep this sub pristine as a research sub. We get there early, and we are usually right. If we let this sub erode into a Q decode hangout it will become a dump. The smartest people will stop hanging out here, because smart people like FACTS.

            When has anything Q said paid off? Anybody can post a bunch of random provocative stuff that leads to something, but never quite culminates in anything tangible. Yeah, it's interesting. First, we follow the white rabbit ... then there was Obama allegedly firing a gun at an American flag ... then Vid 5:5 ... oh, and Wendy and Agnes Nixon ... AND?!!!! Oh, the Standard Hotel and modeling agencies ...
           </p>
           <p>
            Sorry, there is NOTHING he says that is paying off and I refuse to be enticed by a carrot dangled in front of my nose.

             Q told us about North Korea months before it happened.
            </p>
            <p>
             Also, Q is bringing to light all the child sex trafficking lately. Only recently he directed us to Podestas pedo artwork. This is a good thing, you have 60,000 people on reddit investigating this stuff

            we dont need to quarrel about the validity of Q. As Ive said more than once Q is validating Pizzagate. To the extent that Q has a larger following than we do, then our own exposure will be greater.  (of course, the opposite could serve to cast a darker shadow on us).
           </p>
           <p>
            Q is not focused on Pizzagate issues but rather  on 
 Spygate which may be of interest to many of us.   Praying Medic has a video regarding Q and the law which is several months old and explains how the Trump Administration is laying the groundwork for legal action against the deep state. This video explains the 45,000 sealed indictments around the country, the 470 assistant AGs working on these under Atty Huber, the exercise of jurisdiction by military tribunals when violations of law concern sedition, resistance,  treason,  attempts to overthrow a presidency, etc.  , the infiltration of ANTIFA by military intelligience and so forth. . Also discussed was the mass CEO resignations that occurred when Trump signed the executive order expanding  on forfeiture of corporate  assets.  Since Trump has  expressed an interest in stamping out human trafficking, the methods by which this will be accomplished is important for Pizzagators. Finally this video addresses the MSM relationship with the  deep state, the monopoly of the Internet by Google and Twitter and the need to breakup the propaganda machine by using anti-trust laws.
           </p>
           <p>
            So if Q is a bonafide conduit for Trump's intentions and goals,  we can expect some impact on matters researched by Pizzagate.  As you know, Q drops clues forcing his readers to do research. A recent drop directed attention on Clinton related shipping ports for child trafficking which suggests more locations other than Haiti. Maybe the better description is Clinton/ Bush controlled or sponsored ports which brings to mind Saudi Arabia.
           </p>
           <p>
            I have a hunch that Q, maybe even Trump himself , is very much aware of whats happening on voat/pizzagate. We are trading intelligience whether we realize it or not.

             If you were really a lawyer you would know that 45,000 sealed documents do not equal 45,000 sealed indictments. And from reading what you just wrote, I don't think you are a lawyer.

            Encouraging that he called out Silsby. And just a couple of days after highlighting the S8n "please sacrifice pizza" tweet. Reminds me of Trump giving Hillary shit about "taking a few Haitian villages" during the Al Smith Dinner.

              The post is talking about media outlets all saying the same thing because they receive coordinated talking points from a central distribution point. AND THIS IS WHY THIS GARBAGE HAS NO BUSINESS BEING IN THIS SUB BECAUSE BECAUSE IT CONFUSES EVERYTHING BECAUSE EVERYBODY HAS TO GUESS WHAT IT MEANS.
