<p>Special counsel Robert Mueller has begun demanding testimony in his grand jury investigation of alleged Russian meddling with a focus on President Trump’s former campaign manager, according to a report.</p>
<p>Mueller is looking at a lobbying campaign Paul Manafort helped coordinate while he was working for the party of Kremlin-backed Ukrainian president Viktor Yanukovych, a public relations executive who was subpoenaed told NBC on Friday.</p>
<p>Previous reports have said Mueller’s subpoenas have requested info on a June 2016 meeting with a Russian lawyer where Donald Trump Jr. was promised info from the Russian government, though his recent requests suggest an interest in Team Trump’s previous dealings with figures in the former Soviet Union.</p>
<p>It was not immediately clear what information the special counsel, who has a mandate to investigate matters surrounding alleged Moscow interference in the 2016 election, wants about the lobbying effort from 2012 to 2014.</p>
<p>Companies involved included the Podesta Group and Mercury LLC, according to NBC.</p>
<p>The PR campaign was run through the Brussels-based European Center for a Modern Ukraine, which says it supports moving Ukraine closer to the European Union.</p>
<p>Yanukovych later plunged his country into chaos after he turned from a proposed association agreement with the EU in favor of closer ties to Russia, leading to his ouster and the Kremlin’s annexation of Crimea in 2014.</p>
<p>Manafort left the Trump campaign last August after scrutiny of the Modern Ukraine operation, which aimed at getting positive press for Ukrainian leaders in the U.S. and undercut support for a Yanukovych rival.</p>
<p>The Team Trump member said that his work with the group did not require him to register as a foreign agent, though he ended up doing so with the Justice Department earlier this summer.</p>

<p>Media Buries Podesta Group Highlighted in Group of PR Firms Subpoenaed by Mueller</p>
<p>The Podesta Group was one of the firms highlighted, but you would have to read NINE paragraphs into the article to learn this. Instead of the story having its own headline, it was buried.</p>
<p>As TGP reported earlier Friday, the Podesta Group, run by John Podesta’s brother Tony, retroactively filed DOJ disclosures for ‘pro-Putin lobbying.’</p>
<p>How’s that for “collusion?”</p>
<p>Washington Examiner reports:</p>
<p>The Podesta Group belatedly filed severalnew disclosures with the Justice Department on Aug. 17 related to work the firm completed between 2012 and 2014 on behalf of a pro-Russia Ukrainian think tank.Back in April, the powerful Washington lobbying firm run by Clinton ally Tony Podesta filed a document admitting its work for the pro-Russia European Centre for a Modern Ukraine may have principally benefited a foreign government. New disclosuresrevealed dozens of previously unreported interactions the firm made with influential government offices, including Hillary Clinton’s State Department and the office of former Vice President Joe Biden, while lobbying on behalf of the center. Embattled ex-Trump campaign manager Paul Manafort failed to disclose his extensive lobbying efforts on behalf of the center at the time as well.</p>
<p>Anyone lobbying or doing public relations on behalf of foreign governments is required to register as a foreign agent in compliance with the Foreign Agents Registration Act. The Aug. 17 filings include short-form registration statements for six Podesta Group employees and an amendment to the firm’s registration statement that includes a list of political contributions made by relevant employees throughout 2013.</p>

            : This would be a lot easier to read if you used some headline formatting. There should be a little row of buttons if you click "edit" that allow you to pretty up the post. If you can't seem them, you're probably on mobile -- go to your browser settings and choose "view desktop site".
           </p>
           <p>
            Once you can see the buttons, highlight the text you want to stand out as a headline and click the "H" button (6th in from the right). Alternatively, choose "edit" and add a "#" right in front of the line of text you want to format as a headline, no space afterward. Click "Preview" and you'll be able to see how it changes the look.
