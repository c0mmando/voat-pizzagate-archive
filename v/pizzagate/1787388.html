            A news story.  It would be hard to believe such a major news story wasn't real; unthinkable even....preposterous....that's crazy....of course it was real.   The drama, the characters...."Zanny the Nanny".  Surely the citizen search for the body was real....I mean after they saw the news, that was a natural reaction.  Where is Casey now?  Living a luxurious life.  Wonder what she does for work?  She must have sold a few million books or something.
           </p>
           <p>
            A long time ago, I saw where an entire police department in AZ was comprised of those who had acting experience, many still participating in theater....everyone, right down to the clerks.  Kind of strange.....but then in that town, you could see the police were acting in local news stories...playing both the good guys and bad guys in some cases.  With several of the news stories there....there was no doubt it was the officers playing the bad guys.  Particularly, I remember one colored officer who was dressed up as a rastafarian guy who was beat up by police for trying to sell things on the street.  I thought how odd that was.  Why would they even do that?  The stories were inconsequential....just news fodder....but they were creating them....it was like WTF.  Not just police, but local authorities seemed to be in on the gag.
           </p>
           <p>
            That was in PIMA County.  Not long after that....there was the Giffords shooting there in Tucson.  Upon closer inspection...The local FOX news prior to the Giffords event...announced that a "department of homeland security" drill had been canceled, because word of it had leaked and it lost its element of surprise to seem realistic.  A couple of weeks after that announcement....there was the Giffords shooting.....but never a homeland security drill....although the city did receive funding for having had the drill.
           </p>
           <p>
            After that shooting, where Giffords was shot in the head, Giffords went on a mission to get guns banned.  She is married to Mark Kelly, the identical twin of astronaut Scott Kelly....the man who just spent an entire year in space (while his twin stayed here on earth of course).  You can see Giffords and Mark Kelly doing their traveling road show.... where they speak in public against guns.  What I noticed is they use the same script at their different events.  Gabby uses the same line, saying she started "yogurt classes" to indicate her brain injury, and her hubby corrects her on cue every time with "yoga honey"....it always gets a chuckle from the audience.
           </p>
           <p>
            Something else of note is on the news when it showed George Bush visiting the NASA control room....with Gabby right there next to him (its a small world)....Someone put on the big screen in the control room one of the astronauts aboard the space station.....only problem is, he was performing space tricks in front of a Hollywood charted blue screen.....the same tool used in Hollywood to add computer graphic animation to video.  :/   Here is that video:
            <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lc2JZMCRYzU">
             https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lc2JZMCRYzU
            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            Am just sayin'....am pretty sure actors are used to make news stories and its a practice that's been going on a long time on a grand scale, which today is now highly advanced.  I have seen so much evidence of it....undeniable evidence.  Everything from CNN reporting "live from Iraq" where they're getting bombed...but really they're on a rooftop set at one of their studios.  To in the Casey Anthony case, Nancy Grace "reporting live from the courthouse" but you can see the same traffic going behind her and the news anchor "back at the station"; they were in the same parking lot, not at different locations speaking "live via satellite".  And on, and on, and on... the examples are nearly endless of this, from staged protests, actors dressed as the KKK at the Trump rallies etc.
           </p>
           <p>
            Here is a blatant example....some may claim this girl is not an actor, that the news story is real.  Not me..  I do not believe that girl lost both her parents and all her four siblings just two days before the televised press conference, or 5 days before the televised funeral.  That story went that the "gunman" broke into their home, tied all their hands behind their backs and lined them up execution style.  The gunman went down the line shooting them in the backs of their heads.  The girl survived by blocking the bullet to the back of her head with her hand and playing dead.  She lost part of a finger in that news story....but it might comfort all the television news viewers to know......if you look on her social media, she is living a lavish lifestyle, has her own mansion and that finger has grown back since the horrific news story.   Here's a video showing that "news story"....of course when presented on the "news", it was edited differently and more believable, although the footage shown is from the news networks (they are a conglomerate, don't think FOX is any different).
            <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7g4YeLng2kA">
             https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7g4YeLng2kA
            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            So, am not saying the Casey Anthony story was not real.....but who knows.  What about Charles Manson and that Helter Skelter?  Straight out of Hollywood.  They still roll Manson out, where he "talks from his jail cell".  Notice that America was having that peace and love cultural revolution in the late 60's?  That was all brought to a halt and replaced with fear and mistrust by the Helter Skelter story.  Was it fake?  It has all the tell tale signs....national media coverage, with well made productions searing the story into everyone's minds....complete court trial televised.  There are thousands of murders in America every year....only certain ones are made into major media events and get all the focus, only certain ones get books about them and continued media coverage for years and years afterwards.
           </p>
           <p>
            Here is a movie that gets to that point....it seems like Tom Stoppard in his 1960's play "Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are Dead" hits on that aspect of theater.....in how it can be nefariously used to guide society.  A scene from that play was used in this movie, because it spells it out as to how and why it is done.  If you watch the whole play (which was turned into a movie)....the actors lead everyone who died in the Hamlet play to their demise....they did so with theater...a quote from the actors in that play "we do on stage the things that are supposed to happen off, which is a kind of integrity for those who look at every exit as an entrance somewhere else".
            <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9FqGg1Im3A">
             https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9FqGg1Im3A
            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            Stories like Casey Anthony, or Charles Manson, or Gabrielle Giffords...or the Pulse Night Club shooting...Assad using chemical weapons...etc.   100 years ago, those sorts of stories would have been considered "lurid literature" and responsible adults would not allow such literature into their homes or communities....aware of the influence it could bring.  Now its presented as reality on the news, and entire populations are affected by the stories.
           </p>
           <p>
            This all roots back to Disney's Club in the 1930's in CA, "the uplifters" (probably much further back)....and their play "the uplift of lucifer".  The LA county Sheriff in Disney's club back then custom made the badge with the pedo logo on it that's since been adopted by other police agencies across the country.  There's one old game show from like the 60's....where the celebrity contestants were blindfolded and had to guess who the guest on the show was by asking questions.....Jerry Lewis (major figure like Saville in "helping children") was one of the contestants and Walt Disney was the guest.....Lewis had already figured out it was Disney, but asked him another question "are you an actor on stage and off?".
           </p>
           <p>
            Then if we want to look into that Orlando Shooting recently......same tell tale signs of a created story.  For one, look at the building the shooting happened in.....its all fraud.  That is a tiny club, with like 8 parking spots total...to include staff parking.  There is no way 400 some people were in that club as stated on TV.....the witnesses on TV are mostly actors.....or people who were wanting to be actors.  People will say that you couldn't get all the police, the fire, the clergy, the courts, etc in on an act like that....too many people would have to be involved....but really?  300 million people in America alone......a few thousand out of 300 million is less than one percent of the population involved...and all rolling fat for their work...its a wicked world and what people won't do for money.  I don't know....here's the Orlando police department's video that went with the story, where they were "dancing for Orlando".
            <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0G94AT2mL4M">
             https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0G94AT2mL4M
            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            And here's the fire department...they did a similar production...
            <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_trtTfMCTR4">
             https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_trtTfMCTR4
            </a>
            The hospital too...
            <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_WIxd8TmDY">
             https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_WIxd8TmDY
            </a>
            And the corrections department in Orlando...
            <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgXTSLGLzvI">
             https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgXTSLGLzvI
            </a>
            etc.  Of course in person if you were to ask anyone there who was involved....it was all real.  But was it?  Or was it a production news story?  Check out this officer at one of the press conferences.....what's the big grin on his face?  Thought there were dozens of dead people...what's he grinning about?
            <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1UldwQzRV9w">
             https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1UldwQzRV9w
            </a>
            Notice the same officer performing in the dancing for Orlando video?

             Am just sayin' make of it what you will and maybe don't be so quick to assume if it was on the "news" that's its real.  It would seem there's an intricate and widespread practice of fabricating news.....to an almost unimaginable extent.  Like these guys here...  did they really remotely land a space ship on a planet over 30 million miles away that was orbiting the sun at almost 50,000 miles per hour?  Or are they actors?  The whole thing a show?  Hard to say, but if they really did go 30 million miles up into outer space.....then how come they didn't take any real photos or real video while on that mission?  NASA admits the one photo they took is a computer image generated from data sent back by the space ship...and the one video they took.....it too is admitted as a computer animation created from data....so yeah, in other words on that mission they didn't take any real video or real photos.......but you can rest assured that the mission was real....just watch the press conference.
