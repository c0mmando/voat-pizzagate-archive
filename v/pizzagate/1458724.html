           I'm new on the site and didn't know if the subject of aliens in the Podesta emails had been discussed in the following contexts: Sex involving inanimate object insertions or (cringe) intercourse with a young girl where there is visual protrusion in her abdominal area because of her small size (i.e., a visual from the movie "Alien").

            Yes, I realize that's the "accepted narrative," and that's what the MSM has told people through their various propaganda pieces. According to the same narrative, Podesta enjoys playing dominoes over pasta and pizza also, and has "pizza-related handkerchiefs" lying around a field office. whatever that means.  Taking the meanings at face-value leads to unintelligible nonsense, something I'm trying to avoid.

            Is it just me or does anyone else notice that the ping pong ball is in the shape of a phallus/ penis.  Also the exclamation point next to "shut up and fuck amen", is also in the shape of a penis.  It's very subtle metaphor but clear the ping pong reference as we all know is about sex.
Hidden in plain sight.
