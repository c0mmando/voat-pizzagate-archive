            We don't need to read those texts to understand how we can better fight back.  I am speaking from a Christian perspective, but a person poses the greatest threat to the occult/Satan when that person grows in their faith and becomes closer to God.  I don't need to fill my mind with occult teachings because there is a very real spiritual danger that I could be putting myself into and it takes away time that I could use to pray, read the bible, listen to sermons, etc. Patricia Baird Clark is a Christian minister who works with SRA survivors and from her own personal experience, tells people to not read occult books.

            *of course we are here to share ideas and I appreciate your willingness to share OP. My point is simple, we can oppose and expose. That’s effective and it’s necessary. If we start to dig into their belief system we put ourselves at risk. I did research in those areas when I was young and I met some like the people we are exposing. I’ve seen people go dark. It’s not pretty. Just consider what is said in the comments to be a healthy warning. Sun Tzu had wisdom about gifts from the enemy. With that and Nietzche’s wisdom, plus all of scripture, there are plenty of reasonable warnings to steer folks away from diving into the occult.

             Thanks for the advice. Personally, I won't be reading any of the books, but I found this article on them interesting. I added a warning to the OP too so anyone who does venture out is careful not to become lost.

             I agree, but nevertheless I thought it might be a valuable resource for some. The link is just an article about the materials being released.  Even if the books themselves are harmful, it could be useful to be aware that they are out there.

            I have the book and I think she had it printed herself.  It isn't available on amazon or anything like that.  She also has an amazing video about the SRA taking place in Evansville IN  and probably still going on.

            The “occult” is any oxymoronic label given to Satanic belief systems to make it seem special. Satan doesn’t hide his teachings. He hides the truth. With a library card and some cash, I can find more really deep occult books than you could shake a stick at. The only thing really holding back the flow of this “knowledge” is the cover price. I have read many occult books, and dabbled in in things I would rather not ever discuss. There are a few relevant bits to what you are proposing that I could comment on. The symbolism in general; the idea of powerful symbols with multiple meanings, the multiple names of esoteric spiritual powers and the propensity to place negative spiritual concepts in obtrusively public spaces... theses things go way back. Names like Molech, Ashtoreth, Baal of (a place), these are place names for forgotten powers. The appear again and again in multiple cultures. Personally, I fend them to be a gross mockery of biblical concepts, even accounts that predate known scriptural origin dates. If you consider that there really may be a powerful spiritual enemy, then it stands to reason that this enemy is powerful and deceptive to the nth degree. I recommend avoiding any reading of occult materials. Nietchze’s principles of the abyss and the monsters having an effect on you apply.

             I agree with this sentiment.  I didn't open a page of these materials.  I know that I do not want to know many hidden things.  Pizzagate was so horrifically shocking, that at times I wish I hadn't learned about it.  I shared this link because I found it interesting and thought the people in this subverse might as well.  I should perhaps add something of a disclaimer about this to the OP.

              No worries. It may seem like a logical step, but some of us here on pizzagate have already taken that step. Benefit from our mistake. All that is really needed is to continue to oppose and expose. If we start to feel desperate... well there’s prayer. I often have to do that to quell my rage back to a function able level, to hang in there, to refresh my feeling of hope and to open my eyes to the positive.

               We are strongest when we learn from each other's mistakes. Keep exuding positivity and good things will find you. I for one, find it encouraging that people like you are able to come out of such dark places.

            For what purpose are rituals performed? To gain something. If one engages in the occult and is rewarded by acceptance, money, fame, recognition, etc.... This is how the elite lie to get people to join their evil circle. Look at how many famous people and politicians have been blackmailed, murdered, and threatened.

            Within the fool/the child exists a shine of light, a steady chord, an innate and natural manifestation of natural manifestations. By exploiting this portal or pathway that is open in these people/children there is a forced sustinence on a universal energy cleaner and purer than anything we have built to so far.

             Their beliefs are based on material rewards and personal power. The people that are attracted to this kind of thing aren’t limited to one magical book of secrets. If they think they can get power over each other and us, they will branch out. There are many groups: Shriners, jesters, skull and bones, bildergergers, trinlateral commission, finders cult, masons, Illuminati, knights templar, Rosicrucians, wiccans, the OTO, the temple of set, atheistic satanist, theistic satanist and they read the theosophy of Blavatsky, the writings of the yogis, the necronomicon (though Lovecraft was a fiction writer like L. Ron) the satanic bible, anything by Crowley....it goes on and on.

            I'd like to suggest that Dan Brown is helping to indoctrinate people with his "donation". Just like those articles that were suggestively "teaching" the public how to cast a spell on Trump. I'm with

            : the Pizzagate set are reading Crowley (clearly Abramovich is) and sprinkling it in with any other ancient god name they can throw in for good measure.

            is completely correct about the way people do these horrible things to get in the same frequency as the entity they are asking help from. So, if you are a praying person, and want to read any of this stuff-stay prayed up first.

             I’d personally warn anybody away from reading this stuff.  Dan Brown is not doing this for anybody’s benefit, and makes me even more suspect of his books than I already was.  While I think it is important for Christians especially to understand that yes there are people who choose evil in the world, and have a general awareness of their mindset and beliefs, wallowing it in is not a good idea.

              The one I listed from Manly P Hall is the only one I know of that is written in plain people speak and explained so that it can be understood. Most occult manuals cannot be understood by people that do not already know the occult world. Manly Hall actually explains what things mean in plain language which makes that book really valuable and unique. But I hear ya on most occult manuals.

               Yes, I remember that book. I’m sorry if I overreacted. I don’t want to besmirch anyone. When I was reading it, I wondered if the simplification was to be applied as endorsing freemasonry. I reasoned to put it down.

             Fuck Albert Kike and Manly P. Balls and all of these other faggot Masonic authors. Same old shit, over and over, just using different language. "You are your own God" is the gist of ALL Masonic teachings, big or small. It's all about loving yourself, fucking over everyone else, and doing whatever the hell you want at all times, regardless of how it may affect others.

                Not sure about that, but I sure wish I had not left those two books I picked up in Mena.  You would have thought he won a battle as a General with the accolades. From what I read he was just a snake oil salesman, Yankee lawyer, with overtly suspicious backings. I stumbled across him while searching for treasure. That is my hobby. Jesse James is also connected to the Knights of the Golden Circle. The Jayhawks were robbing anyone who had gold while using the war and State borders as an excuse. It is a subgroup that continued at least until the 60's, at least to protect the gold.

               Just because I've read "Morals &amp; Dogma," "The Secret Teachings of All Ages," and "Magick in Theory and Practice," it doesn't mean that I understand the mindset behind someone who eats shit and rapes infants. Honestly all it really does is raise even more questions like "How in the holy hell can anyone actually believe this shit?" Knowing what they believe has done nothing but enrage me even more. All I have left in this fight is extreme anger and rage. God help a Rothschild if he's ever within five feet of me without his posse.

                This is good.  I wish there were more people like you.  The ones I try to wake up are very resistant, as was I a few years ago.  The truth of the reality we live in is too crazy to be believed.

               <p>
                I am with you.  I would have to seriously contemplate what to do if I had a once-in-lifetime opportunity.  I have relatives that fought in both world wars because of these fucks.  Now, we finally have a just war to fight.  I will not miss the chance.

            To preface this, I'm not trying to talk down to anyone.
           </p>
           <p>
            I HAVE read a lot into the occult.  I used to identify as a Thelemite.  I can tell you with a great deal of certainty, nearly all of it is Pre-Harry Potter "Harry Potterism" - People want to believe there are magical forces that can be called on, to do their bidding.  MOST of it can be cringed at, and walked away from.
           </p>
           <p>
            That said - there ARE a lot of "Sex Magick" sort of sects, and people who think going "Dark" with their practices make them more powerful.  I'm just here to say that a person saying "I've done ritual magick" doesn't mean "I've bathed in babies' blood."
           </p>
           <p>
            Most of it is a degree of self awareness away from larping.

             This is basically what I learned as well after a few years of goofing around. I did have a few super creepy experiences that ultimately taught a valuable lesson a forced me to stay as far away from all of that as I possibly could.

             Yes but the people we are talking about aren't angsty teens who listen to goth music and talk about cutting themselves. We're talking about millionaires and billionaires who dedicate their lives to practicing the darkest of the dark rituals that are out there. We ARE talking about the people who bathe in babies' blood, not the little piss-ants on the bottom of the spectrum. Although I wouldn't piss on a Themelite if he/she was on fire, just to be clear.

              Yeah, I just think people should be more careful in terms of "Broad Brush Painting" around this topic.  Obviously a tween who thinks she's a wiccan is different from a senator who's dancing naked for Moloch.

               Problem is that tween is on the path without knowing it. It's the same set of spirits. They don't manifest as horrible at first, they seduce.

                I'm generally agnostic, with a basic appreciation for Christianity.  I don't buy into most talk about "Evil Forces Taking People Over." - I think it's just larping, on a spectrum that has some fucked up shit at one end and some cringe on the other.

                 Those entities exist, irrespective of your beliefs. Of course, TPTB love pushing atheism and solely the material aspect of knowledge onto anyone, whilst they themselves hold onto less hollow truths.

                 I used to be like that-until I tried some of these "workings" and discovered they actually do something. You can extrapolate pretty quickly after that, so I stopped. This is why my faith strengthened. Not because I blindly followed an ideology. I tested the dark side and it answered back, so I shut the door. Now I'm warning people away from bothering to open the door. Believe me, this stuff is no larp.

               You are wrong.  The entity behind both is the same.  The entity wants the child to think it's ok to get her deeper into it.   You are naive and deceived to have said what you did.

            Don't know what anyone else thinks ... 
But my feeling about trying to understand the Satanic rituals would be like trying to make sense out of nonsense.
Organized patriarchal religions invented the "Devil" and "Satan" - and "Heaven" and "Hell" in order to frighten their
members into obedience.  Their effort is to cause the world to live in FEAR -- and CHAOS when they can create it -
which makes their deceptions and criminal acts easier to carry off.
This doesn't mean that the violence of these religions isn't real.  It is.  Always has been.
           </p>
           <p>
            The Old World Religions were based in NATURE.
There were No "Devils" and No "Satans" and No "Heaven" and No "Hell."

              There’s two ways of looking at it.   From a secular perspective, there’s no relation, as many indigenous religions had a different concept of the good/evil dichotomy.  If you’re looking at it as a Christian, then yes, even in well-intentioned pagan worship there can be evil acts that could attract demonic forces and it’s all suspect.
             </p>
             <p>
              There’s a reason why the Spaniards destroyed the fuck out of the Aztecs, and it wasn’t just because they wanted the gold.
             </p>
             <p>
              However, in all fairness, we have to be honest about the prevalence of human sacrifice.  Not every culture practiced it.  Very few practiced it on an industrial scale, the most notorious being those Aztecs.

              Actually, it looks more like the "invaders/discoverers" here practiced human sacrifice ...
you might recall them attempting to enslave 112 million natives here?
             </p>
             <p>
              This was all about stealing their land, of course -- and enslaving Africans here as well.
             </p>
             <p>
              If you listen to the "propaganda of white male history" everyone else is guilty and they did nothing.
             </p>
             <p>
              Every time the US wants to trying to put down native people they suggest they were cannibals or 
practiced human sacrifice.
             </p>
             <p>
              What I see of our Elite-Patriarchy they are cannibals and involved in human sacrifice.
             </p>
             <p>
              How many nations have been destroyed by our US/CIA/MIC in just the last decades?
             </p>
             <p>
              How many children no longer have arms or legs because of US's "illegal wars of aggression."
             </p>
             <p>
              And how is the RCC connected to this violence in actions to destroy Muslims? --
             </p>
             <p>
              More than 1 Million Muslims killed by the US/CIA in their wars.  Looks a lot like their "Crusades."

                  We're not talking about abortions ... and your obsessions.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  Did anyone mention to you that 25 million women were forced to illegal abortions
which in the past has caused the death of many, many women?
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  Actual LIVING women with families and other children?
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  How many women's lives will Trump and the GOP be responsible for killing by limiting
legal abortions?
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  Before you answer that question, let's make clear these people could not care less how many women die from back alley abortions as long as they can force other women to have children.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  Some day you'll wake up to that reality.

              Hey -- I'm not saying that the British may NOT actually be Reptilians and eat children.
Who knows.
             </p>
             <p>
              What I'm saying is that the Bible is the most violent book ever written -
and it was based in the effort by males to oppress and downgrade females and
their former position in our societies which were centered in matriarchy/motherhood.
             </p>
             <p>
              And that the history of this world had too often been moved along by male violence --
including today when you can barely find a day when a male hasn't killed an ex-wife,
or his entire family.  Males are also our serial killers.
             </p>
             <p>
              They were real living males who designed the genocide against the native people here --
whom "Christianity" labeled as "pagans ... only fit to be fed to the dogs."  (!!!!)
             </p>
             <p>
              These were real living males -- Elite/wealthy -- who designed the system of slavery practiced
here -- and which Our Founders (males) protected and saved for them.

             Um, the Old World Religions worshiped nature and nature was considered to be quite cruel. You needed to FEAR the god that didn't grow your crops or "delivered you into the hands of a waiting army".  Do not be fooled. These entities are QUITE real.  Besides, people don't tend to do anything for thousands of years, that isn't working for them. Additionally, people tend toward simplicity and these "rituals" are quite complicated. Humans didn't create this. There was outside help.
Just sayin'

              You're immediately delivering the male FEAR and hatred of Nature.
             </p>
             <p>
              And most of what you're talking about is male violence.
             </p>
             <p>
              Don't ever let anyone tell you that right wing propaganda -- usually based in FEAR -- doesn't work.  It does.
             </p>
             <p>
              And the US is probably the most propagandized nation in the world -- along with Russia -- 
The only difference being the Russians always knew it.  Americans didn't.
Fortunately, Americans have woken up.
             </p>
             <p>
              If you look at descriptions in "art" of Hell, for instance -- you will see that males do have the 
imagination -- and paranoia -- to create very astonishingly violent portrayals.
             </p>
             <p>
              Maybe you're talking about Reptilians?  Reptilians eating children?
             </p>
             <p>
              That's anyone's guess and don't think that either one of us can say we know, either -- right?

             This. Trying to "get" these people is like trying to "get on the same page" with Jeffrey Dahmer. If you're a normal, non-child-eating person, none of it is going to make much sense to you, and even if you understand it, you won't understand it in the same way that a practitioner would. My advice is, if you want "inside info" on how these people think, just read some Aleister Crowley, and maybe "The Satanic Bible" by Anton LaVey. That will give you a baseline understanding of how these people act and think. Reading LaVey will help you to understand how Satanists portray themselves as "intellectuals" to outsiders, and Crowley will show you the "real" side of Satanism, including the child sacrifice rituals.

              I have a sufficient understanding of the evil that men -- and some women -- do.
Thanks, anyway.

              Again -- I continue to make clear that the VIOLENCE is real -- 
but men have been carrying out violence of a very shocking nature from the beginning of time.
Remember Cain and Abel ... just for openers?
             </p>
             <p>
              I'd also suggest that the violence of animal-eating and abuse of animals began in the 
"Garden of Eden" ... possibly begun with the "religious" notion of animal-sacrifice.
             </p>
             <p>
              Eve still stands before us holding the APPLE as the message of what went wrong.
             </p>
             <p>
              Stop the chain of violence -- stop eating animals.

             One reason for the Satanic ritual of raping , torturing, and murder is because this puts the person committing the act on the correct frequency of the demonic entity they want to get in contact with. In order to contact these demonic entities you have to be on their wave length.
            </p>
            <p>
             One way to get on their wave length is raping someone to death. In that frame of mind and state of being you will be on the correct wave length to interact with these demonic entities. This isn't the only reason for ritual, but it is one of them. The demonic entities will tell people to commit horrible acts like rape and murder in order to reach them. Crazy world we live in!

               During child birth, the females in nature are most vulnerable. Then the male mate defends. He is entrusted with a role of protection. If both sexes were not necessary, life would be asexual. There is to be cooperation between different elements. Antagonizing the different elements is at best useless. If you take away the computers and show peoples faces, you will likely see that you are surrounded by many different types, including white males, who abhor violence and shed tears about what is bien done to kids. If you check who says what, you will find that many, including white males, have not included any identity politics in their work here.

              This is probably most accurate. What frustrates me is that the universe is set up this way. What frustrates me more is that people ignore what’s going on around them and it becomes allowed through cultural enabling, but I digress. For those who disagree with your demonic/frequency explanation, I would challenge them to give a better explanation.

             I like how you think.  Religion is a tool to manipulate people.  My philosophy is if my dog isn't impressed by it, I'm not either.

              I think God is real and Jesus we know was a real man, good energy exists and bad energy exists, and there are demons definitely, that can be conjured, which means there has to be a satan, a devil, idk, light and dark, there's always an opposite.  just my opinion........will probs get downvoted for believing in God.

               Exactly. Imitating him is liberating. His message has been cooped by the worlds powers as a control, which many rightly complain about. When we reason deeper, we know that God has no use for robotic mind controlled slaves. He wants liberated, free willed, intelligent humans to freely chose a relationship with Him. He created as an expression of love out of the desire to share. Religions don’t want us to know these things. Satan has infected a debased those institutions as another means of keeping us from saving ourselves. The rebellious angels want revenge for the world they lost in the flood, IMO.

                Well as a Protestant, I really hate when I say "I'm Christian," and people automatically assume I'm Catholic, and when I say that I'm not, I get the "Oh so you're not a REAL Christian" type of questions. It really sucks that when you say that you're a Christian, the first image in people's heads isn't Jesus or God, but it's child-diddling fucking "priests" and the (Black Jesuit) Pope. Really pisses me off to be associated with that filth. Growing up, I was taught that Catholicism had been hijacked and destroyed many, many years ago, and that all Catholics just haven't gotten the memo yet that their organization--and all of its high-ranking members--is a cesspool filled with corrupt pedophile pieces of shit.

                 The best we can do is try to imitate Jesus. It’s sad that this stigma has been attached to him and his message as well. All of those great things that he did and said... overshadowed by the same. It’s gross. If you and I a feel this way, I imagine God does to.

                  It's hard. I wouldn't even begin to call myself Christ-like, because I have a lot of anger and I curse at people a lot. Seeing all the brainwashed masses around me, including my own friends and family (who have laughed in my face when I brought up PG), just infuriates me to a point where sometimes I feel like I'm
                  <em>
                   made
                  </em>
                  of nothing but rage. The little Sheeple who don't believe this stuff is going on, they make me almost

                   I get so angry sometimes.... words fail. I pray and it goes. He just takes it. I can’t explain it. I embarrassed everyone awhile back when my brother in law was leaving for the Netherlands and Europe. I told him about Joris Demmick and Marc Dutroux and I was starting to tell them about PG. Everyone was just laughing it off and telling me I was crazy... acting like there was something wrong with ME. GOD musta held me back, dude, I swear instead of being all apologetic and embarrassed, I just got madder and madder. I told them that people’s ignorance and apathy creates the environment that allows this evil to flourish. Their attitudes about it enable the thing. Nobody wanted to hear that. While it felt good to venta a little anger, it wasn’t useful and probably set back progress with them quite a bit. Oh well. We’re only humans dealing with this. We need a higher power on this one, methinks fo sho.

                    That's the problem I always run into. My anger takes over and before I know it, I'm ranting and raving and most likely sounding like some guy on a street corner. I'm a pretty reasonable, calm guy, but this particular topic gets me fired up, because I was victimized myself as a child, so I have a very deep hatred for these "people." I know that I need to calm down in order to get anyone to listen to me, but even when I start off with a cool head, the second the zombie starts yelling buzzwords like "Trump Supporter," and "Fake News" at me, I just fucking lose it and tell them they're an idiot who is enabling child trafficking with their shitty attitude and their useless pride. After that, the person just walks away and probably goes and tells their zombie friends how they met a "deranged Trump supporter who believed in Hillary Clinton's sex dungeon in a pizzeria."

                     The truth wont stay hidden behind those sham excuses for much longer. Take heart. There are some out there that have been called worse and waiting longer.Half of America and the world is going through this too. If it helps, leave hillary out of it. Heck, theres tons revealed international: satanic Australian and british political pedos, mexican trafficking cartels, chinese organ harvesting, impeached south korean satanic prez. Those avoid the US political dichotomy. Their all verifiabl via google. Lets see them call THAT crazy Trump support.

                      I've noticed that even when you present factual information, if the person you're talking to is determined to see you as "a crazy conspiracy person," they will actively ignore any and all data you give them, regardless of how verifiable it is. It really sucks. The sheeple don't
                      <em>
                       want

                      to know this stuff, that's the part that a lot of PG researchers don't understand. We, the PG folks, want to see behind the curtain. The majority of society, they love the curtain, and if it were ever pulled back, instead of being mad at the men behind everything, they'd be upset at the people who revealed this information to them and shattered their normie existence.

                       This is changing. Slowly, one by one, people are realizing that it’s not sustainable. Who is satisfied with government? NOBODY Who’s is truly satisfied with their religious institution? Almost none. And what can they do about it? There are a handful of things that make people different than animals. One is change. An animal wakes up every morning always the same; under the same programmed instincts it was born with. Humans can change, especially in a crisis. One day soon, a massive group of people is going to be in a crisis that they are not capable of dealing with. Hopefully it will happen in numbers that are manageable by others that are woke. Don’t get to angry at them. Feel sorry for them. For you and me, the path is fairly clear. We know who we are and what we have to do. We need to keep exposing, keep praying, keep learning and keep protecting. The people you are talking about soon will not have the luxury of knowing who they are or what they are about in their world. That connects to another way that humans are different than animals: choice. When there is no crisis, people will choose what is convenient. Those with an underdeveloped conscience will not choose to express empathy. That is not convenient. Some choose to press on in circumstances that are not favorable. Like you. You should be commended. Also, I saw recently that there is a significant rise in witchcraft practitioners, especially in the millennial age group, and for sure among Hillary supporters. They are looking for you, a PG investigator exposing satanism. They want to ridicule and push you to give up. Watch out. The enemy has followers. They know what’s up and their not playing around. Keep yer chin up.

               <p>
                We know very little about the fall of the rebellious angels, but theologically speaking, it’s usually estimated to have happened before Genesis.  We also don’t know why it happened, but it wasn’t because they had something in the antiduvilian world that God had given them to rule/own/protect.  Satan doesn’t want revenge for that.
               </p>

                It sounds like what you’re talking about is the story from the Book of Enoch, which alleges that after the fall, a group of angels who chose God come down to earth and have babies with human women.  I believe in Enoch, the flood is God wiping those offspring out.
               </p>
               <p>
                Even at that, though, those angels weren’t damned to hell, but stuck on Earth.  They aren’t demons (in that story).  I don’t think there is any Christian denomination that acknowledges Enoch as canon, but the story’s out there and it gets referenced sometimes by the New Age movement.
               </p>
               <p>
                Sorry for the long write up; I find most people I know picked up their understanding of angels from either Doreen Virtue or
                <em>
                 Supernatural
                </em>
                .  It’s a hard thing to study because there is almost no serious Christian literature on the subject, but lately, there’s been a lot of “angel communication” and “angel healing energy” shit popping up in the New Age community.  From a Christian perspective, angels should only ever be addressed
                <em>
                 through prayer with God
                </em>
                , and should not be directly contacted on one’s own; demons are still angels, after all.

                 My comment is based on Genesis 6:4-6 which says: “The Nephʹi·lim were on the earth in those days and afterward. During that time the sons of the true God continued to have relations with the daughters of men, and these bore sons to them. They were the mighty ones of old times, the men of fame. So, God saw that man’s violence was great on the earth and that every inclination of the thoughts of his heart was only bad all the time.  He lamented this generation of men on the earth, and his heart was saddened.”
                </p>
                <p>
                 As to the state of the fallen angels, I am referring to 1 Peter 3:18-20, which says: “For Christ died once for all time for sins, a righteous person for unrighteous ones, in order to lead you to God. He was put to death in the flesh but made alive in the spirit. And in this state he went and preached to the spirits in prison,  who had formerly been disobedient when God was patiently waiting in Noah’s day, while the ark was being constructed, in which a few people, that is, eight souls, were carried safely through the water.”
                </p>
                <p>
                 Additionally we have 2 Peter 2:4... “Certainly God did not refrain from punishing the angels who sinned, but threw them into Tarʹta·rus, putting them in chains of dense darkness to be reserved for judgement.”
                </p>
                <p>
                 Later, Revelation explains that as the end times start to gear up, the evil spirits are ejected from the spirit realm, and thrown down to earth. Revelation 12:12
                </p>
                <p>
                 I totally agree with you about the modern angel narrative. It’s not scriptural. I apologize for the long post. I only hope to illustrate that everything we really need to know was already included in the scriptures. It means a lot to me that these things appear to be confirmed in the letters of the apostles. As to the Book of Enoch, I found it of no value. An early work of fiction, which probably generated sentiments similar to the ones you and I hold regarding the modern popular depiction of angels.

                 <p>
                  A few things I could mention (which are hopefully helpful)..
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  Most recently I realized that the phrase "Christ is Love" is literal. I don't know why it took me so long to realize that the message of the allegory of Christ is literally LOVE, meaning CARE. Care is the generative principle, or driving force of all things. Care is what keeps your family together, for example.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  Also, Christianity is a religion, where a priest claims to deliver the word of God. But this is an entirely lazy and unacceptable way of reaching spiritual enlightenment. In fact, it is CAREless for one to rely on another to deliver the word of God. One must Care enough to seek Truth from all sources--especially from within. That's where and why Christ comes from within. Christ is in you. But that message doesn't make money, so religions cannot rely on spreading the word of God and charge a fee.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  Money is another issue that I've grappled with, and I now believe it to be a proxy for free energy. Likewise, consumerism is a proxy for love, but I digress.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  Care and Contemplation must come from within your own heart and mind. And that is the enlightenment. To be illuminated, one must show you the light. To be enlightened, one becomes the light. But these concepts and Truths continually and ruthlessly get hijacked by occultists, including the occult (i.e., all) religions.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  Look at the etymology of the word "religion". It comes from the Latin word religo / religare, which means to bind or thwart from progress. Religion is mind control.

                   You've obviously done a lot of thinking on the subject.  I agree that God is within.  Funny how religion sets people's sites on an everlasting heaven after death when Jesus said the kingdom of heaven is here and now, the kingdom of heaven is within you.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   I finally figured out that it has to be that way because all we will ever have is the eternal now.  There is no future, just an abstraction you think about now.  No past except for memories called forth now.  Now is all there is, all there can be. Now back to lambasting those pesky jews.

                     If you believe that God sits in heaven, has a gray beard and zings lightening bolts at those who displease him, your notions of God might be a bit underdeveloped.

                     We are manifestations of God.  Another way of putting it is we are the process of God becoming God.  That's just what I personally believe.  I might be wong.

                      I'm an armchair Reformation theologian. Trump's mom is from the same small denomination I'm a member of. They go back 300 years. Maybe you should check them out. Subjectivism is not a safe guide.

                       You need to tell me what that means as I have no idea.  Why is what I'm saying subjectivism?

                       I would ask you how can you imagine a God that you are separate from?  Isn't the ultimate communion with God just becoming one with it?  (It vice he since God is neither male nor female)

                        It means basically a "lay" or amateur theologian. I'm "reformed" christian. Subjective, I'm saying your beliefs come from within you, whereas God is objective and reveals thing to us objectively, thru the written word which we assent to subjectively, our faculties bearing witness that the objective word is true, mainly our faculty of conscience, the ability to know the difference between right and wrong. We can't become literally "one" w/ the creator, but we can have fellowship thru and by his terms.

             It depends on what you’re talking about.  Satanism is different than paganism, which in itself comes in dozens of different varieties in its modern form, and it still distinct from the religions practiced in the past.  You can’t conflate these things and expect to understand how any of it operates, any more than you can play with magnets and think you’re learning something about how your blood carries oxygen.  Pre-Christian and non-Western animist traditions (what you’re talking about) have nothing to do with Satanism.
            </p>
            <p>
             The occult is a deliberate appeal to the evil things of Christian mythology.  It’s not synonymous with European paganism in any way, and it has very few similarities with non-European pagan or animistic traditions as they were actually practiced.  The occult is syncretic, in that it borrows ideas or deities from other mythologies (such as Egyptian; Egyptian seems to be popular) but that doesn’t mean it’s an authentic expression of that.  For example, nobody in 3000 BC though Isis was a demon, but that might be how she gets interpreted in occult circles.  There are a number of magic-oriented religions (Voodoo, Santeria) that are combinations of Christian mythology and indigenous practices that a Christian might label Satanic in nature, but can’t be properly described that way in accordance with their own mythology.  It gets really complicated really fast.
            </p>
            <p>
             As to your question about Satanic rituals being “nonsense”, that’s not entirely true even from a secular academic read.  Again, depending on what kind of Satanism somebody is engaging in, there can be (and often is) a high degree of internal logic with clearly delineated beliefs.  Rituals might be very well spelled out, with expectations that specific spells, incantations, or sacrificial practices lead to specific results.  Whether or not that translates into real-world consequences is a different question.  Scrying (for example) doesn’t have to have repeatable, scientific results for there to be a prescribed way to conduct it.
            </p>
            <p>
             I’m sure there are plenty of little edgelord atheists who view Satanism as little more than a way of telling Christianity to go fuck itself.  THere are also likely people who pay lip service to certain occult ideas or beliefs as a cynical attempt to distract or justify their very a-religious depravity.  There are other groups that take the idea of embracing the demonic very, very seriously.  They take the rules very seriously.  It’s not chaos to these people; it’s a short cut to get what they want, and if they have to embrace evil to get it, that’s not a problem.
            </p>
            <p>
             The goal here is power and control, over both other people and the forces of nature.  It’s also about the idea that we are nothing more than animals rutting in the filth of this world.  I could speak to how Christians view this, but I admit that I can’t fully put my mind in the headspace of a truely devote Satanist; what I believe about Satan means its impossible for me to understand why somebody would want to dedicate themselves to that.  I can’t wrap my head around it any more than I can understand why somebody would molest a baby.
            </p>
            <p>
             I get what you’re saying, though.  Since you believe that there is no such thing as heaven or hell, there’s no point in talking about Satanism cause it’s not “real”.  Well, Scientology is not only unproven, but
             <em>
              disproven
             </em>
             , but understanding the rules of their religion and how its adherents live their lives is key to understanding what they do.  It’s also key to knowing how to win against them.
            </p>
            <p>
             I don’t know what kind of self-declared Satanists we’re dealing with amongst the global elite - likely a mixture of both the happy cynics and true believers - but some knowledge of what they believe and what they do is a good thing to have.
            </p>
            <p>
             From a Christian perspective, as somebody who does believe in heaven and hell, exposing yourself to this stuff isn’t something you should do lightly, if at all.  Christianity believes that this is real and had real power, and is not something you ever want to screw around with.  (Of course, there are plenty of happy cynics in Christianity that don’t really believe in evil either, but that’s a whole different conversation).

              WHAT in heavens name are you talking about?
             </p>
             <p>
              Male-supremacist religion/"Christianity" had the power to label people "pagans" which was a method
they used to STEAL native land and their natural resources.
             </p>
             <p>
              You're showing us how brainwashed you are by religion.
             </p>
             <p>
              "Christians" who wanted to steal land from natives (all over the world) simply thought up
the method of branding them as something evil so they could steal their land and goods.
             </p>
             <p>
              As the native people make clear ...
             </p>
             <p>
              "When they came they had the book and we had the land.
             </p>
             <p>
              When they left, we had the book and they had the land."
             </p>
             <p>
              Religion is BS -- and so was labeling native people "pagans ... only fit to be fed to dogs" BS...
             </p>
             <p>
              So was enslaving Africans here just more violence by "white males" who were too lazy to do their own work.
             </p>
             <p>
              Again, NATIVE PEOPLE ARE NOT EVIL ... IT IS 'CHRISTIANITY' WHICH IS EVIL.
             </p>
             <p>
              The difference between Scientology and myths of "Devil" and "Satan" is that Scientology is a very 
obvious scam, but while it is a cult, it doesn't as yet have armies.
             </p>
             <p>
              Christianity had armies -- Christianity traveled the world "introducing the cross with the sword."
             </p>
             <p>
              Christianity ran "Crusades, Inquisitions and Burned people at the stake -- women simply because they
were a challenge to males who wanted to dominate and control others.
             </p>
             <p>
              Best description I know of feminism is by Marilyn French --
             </p>
             <p>
              <strong>
               "FEMINISM IS ANTI-DOMINATION BOF ANYONE BY ANYONE ELSE"
              </strong>
             </p>
             <p>
              One of the major reasons for not trying to understand nonsense is that you give it power.
             </p>
             <p>
              And I think we can look at the people among us who do evil and see how they destroy themselves...
Nixon and LBJ are two who come to mind.  Hared is self-destructive.  So is violence ... because it is
impossible to do violence to others without harming yourself.
             </p>
             <p>
              Meanwhile, here are two thoughts .....
             </p>
             <p>
              "Religion is regarded by the Common people as true, 
by the wise as false, and by rulers as useful."
             </p>
             <p>
              I do tend to think that there is a universal spirituality -- 
This is a liberal nation which doesn't support those with fascist instincts, or those 
who do want war and who continue on in violence.
              <br/>
              This is a nation which wants to be Norway -- being ruled by fascists over the last decades.
             </p>
             <p>
              And, yes, it is about the paranoid among us trying to gain control over others -- and its suicidal
             </p>
             <p>
              The world's major religions used to teach REINCARNATION which is a concept of "eternal life."
Not sure that I want to live 100 or 1000 lives ...
but the teachings became "inconvenient" for Elites as people began to consider their next lives.
             </p>
             <p>
              By the way, if you're male you will come back as a female.
             </p>
             <p>
              And if you're female, you'll come back as a male.  (UGH!)

               Every time you open your mouth you prove how stupid you are. "Christians" are not evil. There is a corrupt layer of Zionist and Jesuit assholes at the top of the Catholic hierarchy that are corrupt and evil and fuck it up for everybody. The vast majority of people that try to live by the principles attributed to jesus, be he a real man or an archetype, are good and kind people.
              </p>
              <p>
               Your goal it to destroy Christianity so that Christians will be taught to worship you Zionist assholes and some of us are smart enough to see through you.

               Okay so two things here; I fully admitted to my biases, and I went out of my way to address these things from a secular stand-point.  You might not like it, but the words “occult”, “paganism”, “animism”, “theology” and so on have meanings in the English language.  These are classifications that we can put various world religions into based on discernible characteristics.  Is calling all non-Christian religions “pagan” akin to the Jews using the word “Gentiles” to identify an outgroup?  Yes.  Does it mean religions that can be classified under the “pagan” header don’t exist, or don’t share broadly definable features?  Fuck no.
              </p>
              <p>
               This shit is an actual thing that can be scrutinized beyond a person’s personal ideological beliefs.
              </p>
              <p>
               A native Inuit from Greenland has a distinctly different belief system from a Hindu, a Muslim, or a Christian.  You can make the argument that the differences between religions have been used as a reason (or excuse) for all kinds of bad human behavior, including conquest and genocide, but you cannot make the argument that those differences don’t exist.

              Your understanding reflects my own. I am a now a Christian. My journey to this point is based on reason and examination of fact, though some may scoff as I say, and science. The only way I could make sense of any of this was to continue to read and read, meanwhile keenly observing for “the proof in the pudding” so to speak. “Wisdom is proved by its works”, is the axiom. While I accept a creator and Christ, I do no subscribe to the trinity or Hell doctrines. To get here, I started with a foundation that is almost word for word what you have written here. Have you ever read “The Golden Bough”? It seems applicable to this conversation.

               The whole thing get super fucking confusing.  I’ve yet to find a good book that lays this all out in a neat, orderly fashion.  I’m very interested in the historical underpinnings of the New Age movement but again, there doesn’t seem to be much in the way of serious academic study into it.  You have to wade through a
               <em>
                lot
               </em>
               of semi-insane metaphysical store how-tos, bemused journalism, and dry as fuck primary source analysis and research from the 1800s to get a sense of it.

              From what I learned when I was younger Satanism was what Native Americans were, they lived with and for nature and believed that nature was a religion upon itself and like we've seen they would give themselves to nature when they got to old as in going out on their own and fight a bear to the death and nature would win of course but that's how they lived and believed. They respected nature.

               Native Americans were not Satanist.  Most can be classified as animist; ie, viewing natural objects as having spirits or spiritual qualities, with little consideration for the Western good/evil dichotomy.  Some more developed civilizations, like the Aztecs or Mayans, had polytheistic pagan religions, where there is a pantheon of god’s who represent/control (but are not necessarily synonymous) with natural and psychological forces.
              </p>
              <p>
               Satanism is the active, intentional worship of Satan.  How can you intentionally worship Satan if you have never been exposed to Christian theology?

               Not true, unless you are talking about the Aztecs and similar civilizations in Mexico and central America who absolutely do qualify as demon worshiping cannibals who aspire to godhood.  The tribes of what is now the USA &amp; Canada had a range of beliefs, with elements similar to Shinto, Buddhism, and Animism.  But, underlying that, they believed in a benevolent creator, a Great Spirit, the immortality of their souls, and the importance of living an honest and honorable life.

               I’ve spent probably too much time looking into this stuff.  The entire subject gets further confused by the New Age movement starting back in the 1960s, but the occult predates that.  It’s actually very interesting how the West’s collective interest in the paranormal has paralleled the rise of secularism.

                That is interesting.  Thanks for your explanations on this thread.  You seem to know a great bit about religious history and I'm sure there are some important lessons to be learned in that field of study.  It is easy to get bogged down in the heavy subject matter in this subverse, but when we take the time to educate one another we can keep carrying on.  Thoughtful, informative posts like your comments are encouraging.  :)

            This raises my opinion on Dan Brown. He did something good with some of his money.
