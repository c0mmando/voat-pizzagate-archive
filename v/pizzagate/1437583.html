They are fucked it\'s game over they said it themselves they serve hundreds of people. How the fuck are they going to catch people when they have to worry about five different people everyday possibly bugging the fuck out of their place. Let me remind u it only takes one big probably right above the tunnels in /redacted/ place (msg me for /redacted/ area) and you will catch them red handed.

You are lying to yourself,  voat, your mother, and every child that has been screwed over by a pedophile if you think these guys will let up for even a day or two this is an international slave trade each kid is sold for tens of thousands of dollars you think they are just gonna stop business because a couple of anons and a banned Reddit crew are crowdsourcing and investigation and they\'re biggest accomplishment of tangible evidence is a fuckig periscope tour where these assholes just laughed in their kill room right after  y\'all fuvKing left. Fuckig disgrace. Bug the fucking restaurant like a real FBI agent or cia agent would because that is how espionage works. Ask fucking Okeefe he\'s basic at this shit but at least fucking sneaky. You wouldn\'t even have to investigate like fucking Okeefe just order a pizza and act normal like the other thousand people that go there every day and find a solid spot for a bug where you can actually hear what goes on after closing hours.

            Have any of you actually dealt, in person, with the FBI, local police, or state police when it comes to investigating sex trafficking? I will probably guess not. They die, judges die, people get set up and put in jail. The FBI doesn't touch it. If anything they help facilitate it just by turning a blind eye. This shit is happening everywhere, whether or not pizzagate is real awareness of underage kidnapping and prostitution needs to be more. Or else it will never end

            Good look didn't think of that too much. Now thinking about it for sure it was fake they didn't show the kill room lol that's the fucking giveaway hahaha after thatbwas the main question they asked. They stuttered like Some little kidS. True regardless if people are already bugging the place they should have evidence by now.

            Might be illegal what you are suggesting.   If someone agrees and does it, that might be conspiracy with you indicted as a felony co-conspirator.   I suggest we proceed within the law.

             Of course it's fucking illegal but that's what you have to do defeat these mofos. and I'm a lawyer so if I'm charged with conspiring I'll do my part to protect myself. They won't even know I wrote this becuase I'm behind about 25proxies however even if they did find out who I was they'd have to find substantial evidence that I was involved.  a simple voat post is not enough to be charged with conspiring to commit espionage

            I feel like people who are good at the internet aren't great at real life.  I'm with you 100%, why do people have no street smarts.  Pretty sure this particular den of pizza, if they were doing something wrong, will stop doing it though, just because they screwed up any cover they had.
I talked to friends in DC, they never even heard of the place - it's not famous, and it's kind of dumpy. That's why is weird the owner was listed #49 in top 50 influential people in DC.   He definitely hosts political fundraisers, why they use his place, there could be many reasons.  I think older gay men are good at making connections, but yeah the instragram is pretty creepy.  Keep in mind, not solid evidence yet.

             Dude I swear there's plenty of understanding people that feel the same way as me they either don't have balls or don't have money to get to to dc or live in dc to properly bust this place. how hard is it to get the bug and plant it. I'll fuvking do it if no one else does lol. I'm great with people I'm cussing like crazy the periscope dudes are idiots they've blown some cover. We coulda got in their before any real attention was on that place and had video evidence of them doing satanic acts to children and presented it to MSM, social media every fucking media by now. It would take maybe a day or even a couple of nighttime hours!!!!

              Too late for that.  The very same people great at "raising awareness"and "bringing attention"  tend to be unstable people who are passionate, but not cold enough to actually evaluate facts and collect evidence.  I was going to say we need the FBI, but screw that.  It's very easy these days to get a coin-sized camera bug to place anywhere you want to remotely view.  We have a mismatch of talents to the task at hand, that's for sure.
