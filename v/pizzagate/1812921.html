            I think there have been white hats, probably FBI, who have been trying to leak evidence about the Podestas all along. The e-fits, the Fatherhood video and Worldcorpo websites... the first FBIAnon basically spelled it all out... Someone was even able to to trace a video clip on the Worldcorpo website to a Chinese restaurant about a block away from FBI Plaza in NYC.

              I've been following the events closely and I would say it's the logical conclusion. The FBI is divided but there are good people who want this to get out.

               I agree. It's not 100 percent clear but I  suspecting more and more that there is an organized group that is working behind the scenes to bring these abusers to justice. It's clearly a deep and dreadful swamp. That has infiltrated so much. Thanks for sharing that post do you have a link? Where did you see that connection to a restaurant in ny?

            I think this guy gets it:
            <br/>
            "So I'm wondering if the parents were sick people and gave Madeline Benadryl or something else to knock her out. Then left the hotel with friends and allowed the man/men/Podesta's or someone else to go in and rape Madeline while they were out. They were not supposed to kill her. When they killed her or the drugs did, they had to get rid of the body so that's why somebody saw a blonde girl being carried on the beach that night and the girl wasn't crying or screaming. The guy who was trained to see body language and listen to how they explain things think they were in on it all and are guilty."
           </p>
           <p>
            The only thing I'll add is that the mother was an anesthesia doctor. So if they rented Maddie out to the Podestas and they gave her anything additional to calm her while they had her, she might have died some time after they returned her.  Children are very difficult to sedate, the tolerances are very small because of their size.

            Gerry McCann is MI5
He is part of the RFID agenda
He is a pedophile (as evidenced by the Gaspar Statements)
His CAT file was erased by Jim Gamble.
           </p>
           <p>
            He was immediately given the spin doctor of Tony Blair.  He has phone conversations with Gordon Brown.
There is alleged to be a photograph of Ed Miliband with Madeleine McCann at a birthday party.
           </p>
           <p>
            There is a photograph of Madeleine in which she has blue make-up on, eyeshadow.  A lolita type shot which has been attributed to a photographer for The Telegraph in the UK.
           </p>
           <p>
            There are more than one of the child.  Her siblings were twins via IFV.  McCann was cloned via IVF and this is evidenced by her changing coloboma within photographs, which on another level signalled to geneticists that they had accomplished very intricate genetic designing capabilities.  Down the minutia of the iris.

             Gerry is a pedofile, a Mason and has friends in high places. He was also in dire financial straits before the fateful holiday. With her colorama and perhaps exalted IVF doner father Maddie might well have been irresistible catnip to someone as twisted as the Podestas.
