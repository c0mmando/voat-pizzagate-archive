<p>First off, I want to say I\'m really happy a new home has been found in voat. Whether or not this all turns out to be 100% real, it\'s an incredibly wild ride. Please do not write me off as a shill with this post. I have fought for truth in other conspiracies and I just want to make sure people are not exaggerating evidence, because doing so hurts the cause as a whole.</p>
<p>I have been surrounded by the acting industry since I was in the womb through my parents and my own brief experiences as a child and an adult. I have an IMDb profile with some minor credits. This does not mean that if I were a victim or a perpetrator** of a mass murder that my death/violence** is not real or that I am a paid actor. If my family members or friends are killed in a massacre, this does not mean their deaths are not real or that I am faking it.</p>
<p>IMDb credits are VERY easy to get and to make. I was involved with a couple of independent local films this summer that were shot with consumer-level home movie equipment that will likely not even leave the editing room (i.e. the shitty Dell laptop of one of the producers). Those are my most recent credits.</p>
<p>To come back to your favor as I\'m certain I\'m making a few people foam at the mouth at this point: When I heard about a craigslist posting in Jacksonville for crisis actors a day or two before a shooting, that was some creepy shit. I\'m not discrediting that sometimes people get paid off to fake stuff. This recent guy\'s movie \'Something About Pizza\' and being a gunman? Yeah, that\'s creepy as shit. </p>
<p>However, most of these ties to IMDb profiles reveal nothing except some people dabbled in one of the most glorified neo-American-Dream industries. Places like Orlando (or certain groups of people such as gays) are going to have a highly concentrated pool of entertainers because the region has historically had this demographic for decades.</p>
<p>I just want to make sure we always keep a level head with evidence and don\'t run off with emotion. This is an emotional subject. There are children\'s lives and sanity at stake here. But, as I know from researching and defending an extremely controversial well-known subject, the entire case is always hurt when weak evidence and/or complete falsehoods are spread. I\'m not saying these leads are 100% wrong, but that we need to make sure to take certain matters with a grain of salt and look at the entire context.</p>
<p>**for the record this is an example and I have absolutely zero interest in any illegal harmful activities of this nature. I feel like with how the internet works these days this needs to be explicitly said.</p>',

            That was added after the event. It's fake. Film from Luxembourg done by Oliver Koos, no relation whatsoever with this case.
