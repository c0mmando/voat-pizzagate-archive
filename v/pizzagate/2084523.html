           <p>
            This will serve as the fifth and final installment in this series. Due to length I am publishing this post in multiple parts.
           </p>
           <p>
            I propose that, like Findhorn, Esalen is a major site for the creation and maintenance of dissociative identity disorder, otherwise known as multiple personality disorder. It is also clearly a seat of power in terms of the real global government, and appears to have unique ties to silicon valley and associated transhumanist globalist groups as well as the CIA. While Findhorn clearly connected to CERN and European groups, Esalen is uniquely Californian and appears to have been associated more with the CIA than the UN. While both foundations appear to be far darker in function than they present themselves, and both campuses are connected to the "Centers gathering," it is important to observe differences between them as well. Esalen has its own unique connections to military intelligence agencies and holds its own place in the history of the development of mind control, with connections to individuals like Alduous Huxley and Gurdjieff, among many others.
           </p>
           <p>
            I think it is also important to remember before diving into this subject that not every person involved with Esalen has had any knowledge of its ulterior activities. I am sure that many guests and even employees of Esalen have been very well intentioned and see the campus as a force for good in the world. Wth all that in mind - the truth behind this retreat for 1%-ers is far from pure.
           </p>
           <p>
            Like Findhorn, Esalen and its founders are directly tied with Tavistock and the military. Like Findhorn, Esalen engages with international figures (including Boris Yeltzin), and is unaccountable to the public due to its NGO status. We cannot FOIA Esalen. We know by Esalen's own account that it facilitates a state-department approved connection with international governments and participates in international relations.
           </p>
           <p>
            According to media reports which were noted in the CIA archive, Esalen participated in what Newsweek called "hot-tub diplomacy" with Russian figures during the cold war. The current re-emergence of a "red scare" aside, the emphasis at Esalen on international relations has continued over the decades.
           </p>
           <p>
            Newsweek article kept on file in the CIA archive:
           </p>
           <p>
            Screen Shot 2017-07-29 at 8.42.47 PM.png
There is an underlined portion in the CIA copy of the article which pertains to the founders' denials that they are operating a CIA or KGB front. The article states: "Some U.S. officials believe that the Kremlin may have special uses for the Human Potential Movement." So even in this relatively benign article, there is the observation of military intelligence connections not only with Esalen as a campus but extremely importantly, with the Human Potential Movement. In this cold-war era article, U.S. officials associated Esalen as an organization with spy-related activity and as a center of "back channel diplomacy" as well as the Human Potential Movement itself - a movement, not an organization.
           </p>
           <p>
            This would speak to my overall thesis not only regarding Esalen the NGO/campus - but about the role of the "Human Potential Movement" as a demonstrably intelligence-backed, Tavistock-linked experiment in the development of mind control techniques, including the creation and maintenance of multiple personality disorder. Esalen and the Human Potential Movement must be understood as multifaceted; their various roles include experimentation, intelligence linked operations and global conference center. I believe that the testimony provided by RA Anon, linked to the previously discussed organizations, is also validated by Esalen's connections to Harbin, which was linked to RA Anon's experience.
           </p>
           <p>
            Screen Shot 2017-07-29 at 8.46.14 PM.png
Back Channel Diplomacy
Esalen's longterm connections to Russia correspond to Findhorn and the Centers Gatherings' long term connection to the Russian Orphanage, Kitezh. The orphanage is connected to Esalen through their shared relationship with the International Holistic Centers Gathering, which was discussed in the second part of this series.
           </p>
           <p>
            Esalen's "Hot Tub Diplomacy" or back channel international relations did not end with the cold war and the dismemberment of the Soviet Union. Esalen Institute's Center for Theory and Research now focus on what they call an " Abrahamic Family Reunion," combining elements of Jewish, Christian and Islamic faiths in an overarching attempt to "communicate" between the often conflicting groups. Esalen's literature refers to the project: " Dedicated to promoting Muslim-Christian-Jewish reconciliation, the AFR draws upon the shared values of peace and justice to heal the historical wounds between the children of Abraham."
           </p>
           <p>
            While this may all sound like an attempt to facilitate a cross-faith empathy, it is also clearly a manifestation of Esalen's continuing interest in international relations and issues relevant to American and Global security, including conflict in the Middle East. One can hardly dismiss Esalen as a simple nudist resort or hippy enclave. It should be viewed for exactly what it is: one of the little known seats for transnational power. Ie, Globalism. It is also interesting that Esalen appears to be participating in an attempt to combine the three religions under the umbrella of Abraham - in this way it is helping to create a homogenized society with as few differences as possible, which as Huxley observed in his Ultimate Revolution speech, is easiest for the true ruling elite to control.

            The subject is such a massive one, that it is impossible for one individual to properly catalogue all of the connections and implications rising from the Esalen Institute. I happily invite readers to dive into their own research on this subject, of which I can only provide a small part. I am aware that I cannot see all the important connections coming from Esalen; it is a difficult task to remotely attempt. More research needs to be done honestly and carefully in this area, and develop further interpretations on the significance of this deeply multifaceted NGO.
