            One of the comments on GLP
           </p>
           <p>
            Having worked for the state of California in the past, and based on knowledge and experience, I know it is VERY RARE if not unheard of, for someone to become head of a state agency at that young age and after only two years experience. Although she has worked in the the Governor's office for 4 years previously, that is a completely different world from heading a state agency. Like landing on the moon....
           </p>
           <p>
            It takes years to fully understand the laws and regulations that mold the day to day activities of a state agency; she is an ingenue and cannot possibly have the skills and knowledge yet which are required to truly deserve this position.
           </p>
           <p>
            To leapfrog like that from the Governor's office is purely based on having pull with Jerry Brown, rather than merit. I'm sure some people in her agency are pissed at being passed over after 25 years of working their way up through the ranks.
           </p>
           <p>
            Doesn't pass the smell test.

             Maybe she kept notes from her days at Disney  to use for her comeuppance...there could have been a wealth of knowledge from working there. Imagine the bargaining chips she could have managed to pull out of the "happiest place on earth".

            Since there's not much mention of it here that I've seen, I wanted to share that California passed a law last month REMOVING LIFETIME REGISTRATION of sex-offenders. The law was introduced and passed by Governor Jerry Brown.
           </p>
           <p>
            What does this have to do with John Podesta? His daughter Alexis is Jerry Brown's Chief of Protocol, and Director of National and International Affairs among other positions.
           </p>
           <p>
            She's also just been promoted.
           </p>
           <p>
            Given the constant push to normalize pedophilia, we can now connect directly to John Podesta through his daughter. Everyone remember the recent demonic Trans reading at the Michelle Obama Library in Long Beach, CA to children? Who do you think is organizing it?
           </p>
           <p>
            " 
SACRAMENTO - Governor Edmund G. Brown Jr. today announced the following appointments:
           </p>
           <p>
            Alexis Podesta, 36, of Carmichael, has been appointed secretary at the California Business, Consumer Services and Housing Agency, where she has served as undersecretary since 2015. Podesta served in several positions in the Office of Governor Edmund G. Brown Jr. from 2011 to 2015, including, director of external affairs, director of international affairs and chief of protocol. She was a special assistant to the senior vice president of public affairs and senior advisor to the chairman and chief executive officer at Pacific Gas and Electric Company from 2009 to 2011. Podesta was manager of government relations at the Walt Disney Company from 2007 to 2009 and served as director of scheduling in the Office of U.S. Senator Dianne Feinstein from 2002 to 2007. This position requires Senate confirmation and the compensation is $194,105. Podesta is a Democrat."
