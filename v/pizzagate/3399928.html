<p>&quot;What Clinton did not mention was that her bond with Kissinger was personal as well as professional, as she and her husband have for years regularly spent their winter holidays with Kissinger and his wife, Nancy, at the beachfront villa of fashion designer Oscar de la Renta, who died in 2014, and his wife, Annette, in the Dominican Republic.&quot;</p>

            And this folks is “climate change” in a nutshell. CC=33. Manipulating weather with clouds, floods, fires, earthquakes, tsunamis, you name it and the world is buying into Climate Change not know it’s all being manipulated by the evil elite whenever they choose to and make us pay higher taxes to help “fight” climate change, it’s laughable.

            A hurricane named DORIAN?
           </p>
           <p>
            Check out the plot of the classic novel, The Picture of Dorian Gray.
           </p>
           <p>
            "The work, an archetypal tale of a young man who purchases eternal youth at the expense of his soul,.."
           </p>
           <p>
            "The story begins in the art studio of Basil Hallward, who is discussing a current painting with his witty and amoral friend Lord Henry Wotton. Henry thinks that the painting, a portrait of an extraordinarily beautiful young man, should be displayed, but Basil disagrees, fearing that his obsession with the portrait’s subject, Dorian Gray, can be seen in the work. Dorian then arrives, and he is fascinated as Henry explains his belief that one should live life to the fullest by indulging one’s impulses. Henry also points out that beauty and youth are fleeting, and Dorian declares that he would give his soul if the portrait were to grow old and wrinkled while he remained young and handsome. Basil gives the painting to Dorian."

              Work is underway to complete the construction of an ionospheric research facility at the Arecibo Observatory in Puerto Rico that bears some similarities to the High Frequency Active Auroral Research Program (HAARP) far to the north in Alaska, but on a different scale and with different research goals.
             </p>
             <p>
              “It is basically the same as HAARP for the science, except that HAARP was in the Auroral Region, where the physics of the ionosphere is quite different with all the energetic particles and magnetic fields,” Penn State Electrical Engineering Professor Jim Breakall, WA3FET, told ARRL. “HAARP also had 3 gigawatts of effective radiated power, where Arecibo will only be about 200 megawatts.”
