            Hello New here I am searching for anyone else who was a victim or even acquaintance of Jeffrey Epstein at Interlochen Music Camp in Michigan. Anytime, but particularly early 90s or late 80s. My name is Joy,  I auditioned for Interlochen Music Camp in Jr high, as a dancer and singer. After reading all the Epstein news stories, I am trying to make sense of the abuse I went through and who all was involved. I don't think I should name names but I remember my 5 fellows and we were all from Oakland County Michigan, same as Sarah Ruth Ashcraft, who said she was abused by Tom Hanks. I know I am not alone in this. We auditioned ensemble for voice, piano, cello, violin or viola and maybe more. And we were recorded. I am looking so hard to find those other Jr high or other students I auditioned with, question, as I sure some or all of you remember what happened. Please contact me so we can put this puzzle together and even press charges. Please contact me even if you do not want to press charges. I hope you have healed and I want to be in this together for justice. I am no longer in Michigan but hope to connect with the others from ensemble and audition.
