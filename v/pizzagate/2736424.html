            That's the same Lily Allen that said that the victims of Muslim rape gangs in Rochdale would have been raped by somebody else if the Muslim perps hadn't raped them.
           </p>
           <p>
            That's actually the same Lily Allen - the singer - who said that the victims of the Muslim rape gangs in Rochdale would have been raped by somebody else if the Muslim perps hadn't raped them.
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             Lily Allen has now apologised to victims of the Rochdale grooming gangs after her inflammatory remark prompted a backlash
            </p>
            <p>
             Allen's comments came after a follower quizzed her about grooming gangs made up of British South-Asian Muslim men, asking if the victims would have been raped 'if the attackers had not been allowed into the UK'.
            </p>
            <p>
             She tweeted last night: 'Actually, there's a strong possibility they would have been raped and abused by somebody else at some point.
            </p>
            <p>
             However the singer deleted the tweets and blocked a number of followers after she was attacked by users for ‘vile’, ‘sick’ and ‘repugnant’ inflammatory remarks about child victims of sex abuse.

             <p>
              Nine men were convicted of sex trafficking and other offences including rape, trafficking girls for sex and conspiracy to engage in sexual activity with a child, on 8 May 2012 and ten more were convicted in another investigation in 2015.
             </p>
             <p>
              Forty-seven girls were identified as victims of child sexual exploitation during the police investigation.
             </p>
             <p>
              <strong>
               The men were British Pakistanis which led to discussion on whether the failure to investigate them was linked to the authorities' fear of being accused of racial prejudice. The girls were mainly White British.
              </strong>
             </p>
             <p>
              <strong>
               In March 2015, Greater Manchester Police apologised for its failure to investigate the child sexual exploitation allegations more thoroughly between 2008-10.

             Most soccer and football fans who still obsess about football players well into their adult hood are probably gay..

            My money's on Brian McFadden, former Westlife singer. He also released a song that was a bit date-rapey in content and he's of the right age. Maybe someone should ask him straight out via Twitter or something.

            Second in line of suspicion, and probably more likely to be a friend of her dads, is actor Ralph Little.
           </p>
           <p>
            Both are the right kind of age and both have played celebrity football matches.

             Actually, by the looks of things there is one charity football match that stands out as being the likely one; the Soccer Six games at Stamford Bridge in 1999. Dane Bowers is a likely suspect.
