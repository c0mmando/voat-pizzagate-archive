<p>Next to FOWL HOLDINGS LLC they put &quot;(was that misspelled – should be Foul?)&quot;. I can\'t believe they didn\'t realise that CHICKEN is a type of fowl. CHICKEN HOLDINGS? Any idea what this company did?</p>
<p>I saw another interesting one called HOUSE OF EQUUS LLC. I recognised the name EQUUS as a Daniel Radcliffe play about a horse. Then I remembered that PEGASUS was a horse from Greek mythology. I looked up EQUUS to see what the story was about.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Most important are religious and <strong>ritual sacrifice themes</strong>, and the manner in which character Alan Strang constructs a personal theology involving the horses and the supreme godhead, &quot;Equus&quot;. Alan sees the horses as representative of God and confuses his adoration of his &quot;God&quot; with <strong>sexual attraction</strong>. </p>
<p>Dysart reveals a dream he has had, in a <strong>Grecian/Homeric</strong> setting, in which he is a public official presiding over a <strong>mass ritual sacrifice</strong>. Dysart slices open the abdomens of <strong>hundreds of children</strong>, and pulls out their entrails. He becomes disgusted with what he is doing, but fears being murdered in the same manner as the children if he is discovered as a &quot;non-believer&quot; by the other priests, so he does not stop. Eventually the other priests, aware of his misgivings, grab the knife from his hand before he awakens from the dream.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>One more thing which is just bizarre. Although EQUUS is the name of the story, the horse in it is actually called NUGGET. As in chicken nugget? So the story is about a man who has sexual feelings for a Nugget and dreams of homoerotic settings in ancient Greece where he\'s sacrificing children.</p>',
