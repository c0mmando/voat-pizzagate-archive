<p>With the recent events going on I’ve decided to launch a platform for aggregating content. I don’t see how we can possibly change anything without getting down to the bottom of our information platforms. I quit all projects and invested all my money into a project called Deepsee.io… </p>
<p>What is DeepSee? </p>
<p>Deepsee.io is a content aggregator similar to reddit. You simply make an account, and you have the ability to post content under categories and subcategories which serve as communities. Users can also user our Shout system as a more informal way to communicate a spread content. </p>
<p>What are Categories?</p>
<p>Categories act as communities much like subreddits however these communities feed into each other as the content becomes more generalized. I will use sports as an example… </p>
<p>Sports -- Football --- NFL, NCAA, Tennessee Titans/Clemson Tigers </p>
<p>As content is submited to more specialized feeds it has the opportunity to possibly trend upwards into more generalized categories… </p>
<p>Content Types? </p>
<p>DeepSee currently hosts three types of content Type 1,2,3…</p>
<p>Type 1 - Informative content &amp; new articles. </p>
<p>Type 2 - Text content, self posts, questions, etc </p>
<p>Type 3 - Non serious, informal, funny content </p>
<p>How is content graded? </p>
<p>Content is graded with a upvote, downvote system that generates a user rating as well. Type 1 content is always subject to a professional rating as deemed by professionals in that category. </p>
<p>Who is considered a professional? </p>
<p>Deepsee.io verifies top industry professionals in their niche. Based upon the profession or skill awarded we allow these users to affect the professional category. As time goes on we will allow for categories to set the professionals manually based upon our verification abilities and community demands. </p>
<p>Journalist Ratings</p>
<p>At Deepsee.io we use our scoring system to generate a leaderboard of the top journalist based on user &amp; professional opinion. Every article submitted to Deepsee.io catelogues the journalist linking them to the grade of the content the write. We hope this will change the way journalism is playing out today. </p>
<p>Using Machine Learning to defeat bots and marketing departments </p>
<p>We will have a ZERO tolerance policy for botting and vote manipulation. Starting right away and improving over time we will have machine learning algorithms to help us detect bots in addition to vote manipulation. </p>
<p>We’re going into beta + Testing very soon. Currently working with a team of 7. If you’re interested in signing up for the beta please visit DeepSee.io </p>
<p>If you have any tips, suggestions, or ways to prevent this from becoming a shill heaven please let me know. I will answer all of your questions. We’re also looking for (1) more React, Rails developer. Node is a ++++ too. </p>

            you have to understand the shills here don't need to control things with bots.  they are organized, know one another and vote as a group of registered members.
           </p>
           <p>
            I believe you have to have a moderator and it should not be any current moderator at Voat.  It should be a trusted member chosen by the community.
           </p>
           <p>
            The other thing you are going to need to consider - what is your free speech policy?  I for one am considered a troglodyte by the mods here because I have insisted since the begining and still do that a total free speech forum does not work for controversial topics that attract paid shills like pizzagate does.  In other words - rules about deletion for posts that exhibit racist, bigoted, homophobic speech, all doxing and doxing and harrassment, vigilante justice and violence posts.
           </p>
           <p>
            As well you need to have a couple of goodies to be attractive - a good search engine, and some kind of barrier to shill accounts such as a certain number of points or votes earned before privileges to vote or even comment.
           </p>
           <p>
            Hope those are some helpful suggestions.   Good luck.  There are many people who will be eager to try out something different than this place.

            Sounds somewhat interesting, and I'm guessing it has merit, but as someone who is not very tech savvy, my observation (and I'll hazard that I speak for many) is that as the quality and volume of information generated by citizen journalists related to things like pizzagate, deep state, NWO, etc. increases, the potential for vital information to be lost through a black hole or an overabundance of venues also increases.
           </p>
           <p>
            At one time, there was mainstream media, print, tv, and radio, and while it was under the control of the PTB even then, there was somewhat more honest journalism in days past, and everyone got the same news. With the advent of the internet,  there was a growth of alternative news sources that changed many people's perception about how the world works and who runs it. Now there is a virtual tidal wave of forums, blogs, websites, youtube channels, twitter, Gab, facebook, chatrooms, etc., where vital information gets posted but is distributed into irrelevance. I mean one good VOAT thread with interesting content might be seen by a few hundred people when in fact it's information worthy of a 72pt headline in the New York Times. The PTB never has to worry about wide distribution of damaging news because it rarely reaches a substantial audience. After perusing 4chan, Reddit and other sources for PG related info, it was a leap to regularly follow and eventually participate in VOAT, and having to consider yet another platform to follow for any key new information appears daunting. Regardless, I hope you have success.

             We're doing our best to attack the problem from many angels. We feel like for all the grading/ranking systems we have, we need one for journalism. Not only that, but we need a community who can organize the raw data in multiple ways so that users can better interpret it.
            </p>
            <p>
             We're all about trying to build a community for the community. It's far to common to see these tech giants get carried away once they have the network and the barriers to entry are too high. If you want a beta or anything feel free to reach out! Thanks man.

               Having a more decentralize platform would be the ideal goal, but I'd never support a currency like bitcoin which is just as bad as any FIAT currency. If a crypto-currency emerged that was backed by gold I'd be all for it. A real consideration is also building a platform for the IFPS version of the internet that will be gaining more popularity as data bottlenecks.

               Developing our own add platform &amp; hosting is at the top of our development lists after we flex out more of the site features. We'll be looking to design a full open ad platform that doesn't rely on partnerships a gives users a much more substantial return on their ad value.

               More things are in the work, but it's really just all talk till we get it done =P

              Sure, I'll give it a whirl. Just sent a beta request at the site. Something just jumped out at me. Rather than just a simple up or down vote, what about some kind of content grading system, say 1 through 5 or 10? It's subject to abuse, but keen readers are  able to discern the truth if there is a sufficient sampling size. A simple up or down may not be as effective since content quality forms a continuum.

               It's something to consider, but definitely was to start simple. Rating content that way is very relative, but I think it could be a promising addition to add in the future!
