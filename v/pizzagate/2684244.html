<p>Maastricht police say they have made a major breakthrough in the hunt for the killer of an 11-year-old boy in 1998, and insiders say it may be connected to the mass dna testing in the region earlier this year. A press conference is being held at midday to give more details but Dutch tv crime reporter Peter R de Vries said on Twitter that a ’20 year effort will be rewarded’.   Altogether more than 21,000 men in Limburg were asked to submit their DNA, making it the largest mass sampling exercise ever carried out in the Netherlands. Around 65% responded. Officials said in January that the test may identify a close relative of the killer of Nicky Verstappen and say it is the ‘last realistic chance’ to find the murderer. Nicky was taken from his tent while at summer camp in August 1998. His body was found the next day but his killer has never been identified. A cold case team started re-investigating the murder five years ago and now new techniques have allowed scientists to identify dna found on Nicky’s body and clothes. In 2010, police exhumed the body of an 85-year-old man in connection with the murder, without result. </p>

<p>Dutch police is on the lookout for Jos Brech. He is suspected of involvement in the death of 11-year-old Nicky Verstappen in 1998. Jos Brech’s current whereabouts are unknown. He left the Netherlands in the fall of 2017. His last sign of life dates from February 2018. His relatives reported him missing in April 2018. His last known place of residence was Vosges in France. </p>
<p>Over the past few years he was mainly active in the world of bush crafting. </p>
<p>He organized trips in Europe, among other things, and as a result regularly stayed abroad himself. He is an experienced bush crafter, which means he can survive in the wild for a longer period of time. At present, Jos Brech is 55 years old.</p>

            <p>
             The murder of Nicky Verstappen refers to the event of 10 August 1998 when an eleven-year-old Dutch boy was found murdered at Brunssum.
            </p>
            <h1>
             Disappearance
            </h1>
            <p>
             Nicky Verstappen ( March 13, 1987 ) from the Limburg village Heibloem disappeared on August 10, 1998 when he was at camp with a group of villagers. The camp was organized by local youth and took place at De Heikop, a recreation resort on the Brunssummerheide.
            </p>
            <p>
             On the night before his disappearance, the activities ended at 22.00, after which the children went to their tents. In the tent where Nicky slept, he was seen by a tent companion the next morning at around 5.00 am. Three hours later he appeared to have disappeared from the camp site.
            </p>
            <p>
             The managers first went looking, but when they could not find Nicky, they turned to the police. He did not take any action at first. The managers distributed posters in the area and in the evening people from Heibloem came to help with the search. However, results did not materialize. The next day a large-scale search was started with the help of the police, the Marechaussee, soldiers, an airplane and a tracking dog. Around 9 pm Nicky's body was found near a Christmas trees plot, about 1200 meters from the camp site.

            <p>
             On Wednesday, August 22, 2018, just over 20 years after the murder, a live broadcast press conference was broadcast at the police station in Maastricht , announcing that a 'big breakthrough' was made during the murder. The Public Prosecutor announced on that day that there is a DNA match with a 55-year-old man, Jos B., who lived in Simpelveld at the time of the murder. It is currently unknown where B. is staying since he left for hiking in the Vosges in February 2018. A European arrest warrant has been issued against the defendant and he is placed on the national search list.[7]

             Two years ago, Germany's Catholic Church was rocked by reports of widespread child abuse. But Stephan Ackermann, the bishop subsequently made the German Bishops' Conference's spokesman on such issues, has rattled many in his own diocese by refusing to actively pursue investigations or impose harsh penalties.~

The Prince went to court to request a €50,000 fine and the removal of the photos from the website.[6] The court agreed that the photos must be removed, and imposed a fine of €5,000 to be paid every time photos of children of the royal family are placed on the site again.

He added, "Of course we reject this and distance ourselves from this personal initiative." RTL obtained interviews both with Spronck and the priest (73-year-old "Father Van B.") in which the two defended adult-child sex as not always damaging.[12] The priest concerned had prior convictions for child sexual abuse.[13]

             We can see that in total, there's only approximately 3 hours of driving from start to finish.

             Not that this necessarily proves much either, but, for the sake of knowing.

            Hi @ Micheal84, thanks for posting. I would like to ask you however, to point out how this case is relevant for our investigation of elite pedophilia and elite child trafficking.
           </p>
           <p>
            I will give you a 24 hours Grace flair. Thank you!
           </p>
           <p>
            Please keep up the good work.

                 @Michael84
                </a>
                , after I read in the Daily Mail about the case yesterday, and the article said that he was a boy scout
                <em>
                 leader
                </em>
                , I asked
                <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/user/Vindicator">
                 @Vindicator
                </a>
                to please remove the flair during his shift. Wasn't able to do it myself, since Voat had issues for a couple of hours yesterday. Sorry, that he was 'active in at a scouting club' should have rung a bell. Cheers, think- (No, I won't make it a habit.... :-P).
