            I watched this video-Culkin is a Satanic practitioner that is grooming young  children-it has  all the Satanic symbolism, and even a  prayer to Baphomet-this is  not a joke, this is dark eerie shit, and just looking at  this  poor  boy-he has  been a slave all his  life, his sadness and tears he wears in  his  spirit-but do  not mistake this-this  guy and those like  him need to  be stopped-this is a sadness beyond  words

            I'm not sure where anybody got the notion Culkin was a savior and any intention of outing pervs in PedoWood. He's never even hinted at outing anyone and even given the honor of being brought in to bolster Michael Jackson's ''innocence'' by testifying he was never ever ever molested:
           </p>
           <p>
            <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wbu-lFxxNi8">
             https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wbu-lFxxNi8
            </a>
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             "Macaulay Culkin almost single-handedly devastated and shook the foundation of the prosecution's pattern of evidence against Michael Jackson."
            </p>
           </blockquote>
           <p>
            Do you actually believe the pervs would trust someone not thoroughly onboard in terms of being bewitched, seduced, and having allegiance to Baphomet with such an ''honor''? I mean, the right person could have blown that case wide open the other way by telling the truth.
           </p>
           <p>
            Here ... do these photos look like someone not into the ''pizza'' lifestyle?

            Just scroll down the list of tweets. He's seduced. He's one of them. He's GONE! I know it's hard to believe that that kid in the HOME ALONE movies has flipped into being one of them, but he has. And the drugs are all a part of keeping him loyal.
           </p>

            Like the tweet says, ''He never had a chance.''

             I don't know either. I just noticed someone hoping his AMA indicated something, but all I got out of it was a huge pile of meaningless snark, other than wondering what in the world bunny ears would mean to him. All the ass kissing on that AMA was appalling. It's no wonder celebrities are so deranged, how addicting it must be to have to do nothing but exist and people are clammering for your attention, even when you're a washed up has been. And the garbage on this site is so worthless, meaningless, yet all the comments of people loving it, supporting it. I really don't get it.

              Just distraction, disinfo and using his celebrity. Everyone in the goddamn world was in love with him when he starred in those movies, and he's in love with the people that robbed him of his innocence? He's as bad if not worse than that shill Feldman. Who'll they feature next on that CIA-run site? Rob Reiner? Geffen? How about Schneider? Yeah! Make it a Tribute to Nickelodeon Day! WOO HOO! Lady Gaga would be good ... or Katy Perry ... bet those two could get a lot of Baphomet jokes in there!

             For what it's worth, it says it's meant to be satirical. 
It's hard for me to even read the remarks on this site. It screams of Star eyed worship of a washed up actor, I never cared anything about actors even when I was a kid. They all sound so desperate in a "notice me, senpai!" Way.

             While I read it I also thought about what kind of energy comes from just the exposure to the words. Clearly imagery and symbolism have power, this I'm sure fits right in even if you don't intend anything with it.

             They wear the animal masks to simulate bestiality if they cannot get animals. Bestiality is a big part of SRA. Sodomy is the main component along with violent blood sacrifice to what they believe.

              Like the furry parties.  I don't know if you have noticed but the latest fad for kids is to wear hats that look like animals.  It has just recently occurred to me.  I can't believe it did not click before.  Sickening how they are steering kids toward this.

               It's not just the hats either, there are many hat/scarf combos that cover the arms and have paws attached for the gloves.
I remember realizing how sexualized Halloween had become when I was about thirteen in the 90's. It's an ever increasing in speed progression of normalization.

Trying to normalize acceptance of Luciferian reverence? So edgy…. Ah, humor, yes. I laugh. Why not joke about fucking newborns and toddlers before they pass the ‘best by’ date and are sent to the shredders? At least it’s actually edgy. Now be a dear and pass the Haitian.

             Did you happen to notice the circle of hands?  Some little children and a baby.  Very weird.  All the children forming a circle.  Possibly the occult.
