<p><sup>The Frank Report</sup></p>
<p>Some days, it’s just not worth getting out of bed.</p>
<p>And if you’re Keith Raniere, some days it’s just not worth getting out of your prison bunk at MDC.</p>
<p>Yesterday was one of those days…</p>
<p>First, came the news that Nancy Salzman, his original partner-in-crime in the NXIVM/ESP criminal enterprise, was going to plead guilty – and, in all likelihood, end up being one of the prosecution’s prime witnesses against him and his remaining co-defendants in the case of the U.S. v. Raniere Et Al.</p>
<p>Next, came a filing by the prosecution that exposes more of the evidence that it plans to introduce at his trial.</p>
<p>The new details were set forth in a Memorandum-of-Law that the prosecution filed yesterday in support of its pending motion to admit “certain racketeering evidence” in the case.</p>
<hr />
<p>Before we get into the details, let me explain the legal context of this situation.</p>
<p>As readers of the Frank Report may recall, the First Count in the superseding indictment in this case – which, by the way, applies to all the defendants – is for “Racketeering Conspiracy”.</p>
<p>Commonly referred to as a “RICO charge”, the First Count involves various “predicate acts” that the prosecution alleges were undertaken as a part of a Racketeering Enterprise.</p>
<p>Well, simply put, it means that the prosecution can introduce evidence of other “crimes and bad acts” that the defendants did even if those activities are not part of the charges pending against them in this case.</p>
<p>Normally, such evidence would be barred as being prejudicial to the defendants in a criminal case. But, unfortunately for Raniere and his remaining co-defendants, it’s totally admissible in cases involving a RICO charge.</p>
<p>So, what are some of these “crimes and bad acts” that the prosecution wants to tell the jury about?</p>
<p>Here are some of the ones listed in yesterday’s filing...</p>
<p>• The defendants’ use of political strategists and lobbyists to illegally gain political influence – and to use that influence to have their perceived enemies indicted for crimes they did not commit or on the basis of false or misleading information (This was done to Frank Parlato, Joe O’Hara, Toni Natalie, Barbara Bouchey and John Tighe – and, quite possibly, several others).</p>
<p>• The recruitment and grooming of sexual partners for Raniere, both within and outside of DOS;</p>
<p>• Clare Bronfman’s “longstanding intimate relationship with Raniere”;</p>
<p>• The facilitation of Raniere’s sexual relationships with two underage victims: i.e., a 15-year-old girl  who was employed by Nancy Salzman and who, ten years later, became one of Raniere’s first-line “slaves” in DOS – and a child whose sexual relationship with Raniere was known to, and facilitated by, members of the Racketeering Enterprise (The prosecution expects to introduce, among other sources of evidence, dated images of the victim, constituting child pornography, that were created and possessed by Raniere – and electronic communications between the victim and Raniere reflecting their sexual relationship and indicating that it began when she was 15-years old);</p>

            Mexican connection......Billionaire Carlos Slim from Mexico is the largest share holder for NY Times. It is said they would have gone under already if it were not for the money he poured in....Keith Raniere , got his start in Ark, when bill clinton was gov. World wide huge money behind it. Lots of connections to clintons including Andrew Cuomo and Kristen Gillibrand...when the clintons moved to NY from Ark , so did Keith Raniere.........https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q48-ZHhAX-g

            While people who are normal may not know about this evil organization, it appears to be a huge web of crimes and many people will be dragged in because of their connections. So, maybe, just like Al Capone was a murderer and all else, he was brought down through tax evasion charge. It might be the same thing with this whole RICO operation. And, it could be more palatable to the normies, who cannot consider the evil that actually exists among these psychos. Remember the 60-40 rule!

            Thanks for that update and an informative post. It gives me a shudder to think that if “she” had won this whole thing would never have seen the light of justice but would likely have expanded and prospered.

            Does all this open the door for the investigators and prosecutors to, well, investigate for any and/or all crimes committed? I would think that if they found evidence of other crimes, they're duty bound to bring it all to light.

             RICO cases are handled in a manner similar to our current Special Counsel modus operandi.  The only difference is that they actually start with a crime where the SC had no crime and is spending taxpayer resources for years investigating a person to find a crime.  With RICO charges pending, as Darkknight111 so aptly explained, while waiting for trial, prosecutors and investigators can keep digging.

              Exactly! The reason that Mueller was so successful at being corrupt was that he abused his power. It goes like this, enemy target, find acquaintance with any crime attached, then somehow get back to target. Easy when attacking lower level players. Pitting rival mobs against each other in Massachusetts was child's play for what he was to become. RICO is a powerful tool for good, in the right hands.

            Emiliano Salinas indictment is coming soon. I hope. He's the key to unlocking a lot of the corruption in Arizona.
