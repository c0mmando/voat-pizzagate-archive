           <blockquote>
            <p>
             When a Baton Rouge Boy Scout leader slipped out of the state in the summer of 1986, he didn't bother with a goodbye to Robert Walker, a Scout who had, for a time, considered him a father figure. For the next 26 years, Walker wondered what happened to the man.
            </p>
            <p>
             He had questions for him: about the vodka parties they'd had when he was 14, about the pornography they'd watched together, about a night in the backseat of a van when he says he pretended to sleep while his Scoutmaster fondled him. He told no one. And while he kept his secret, the Scouts were keeping one, too. ...
            </p>
            <blockquote>
             <p>
              His 26 years since have included two suicide attempts, a failed marriage, and an adulthood of self-doubt and self-blame that he attributes, in part, to the abuse he claims he suffered at the hands of his Scoutmaster.
             </p>
             <p>
              "He made me feel special; he was like a father."
             </p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>
             To a certain extent there was almost a love involved," he says now. "So I felt like maybe I had done something to deserve this. Maybe I asked for this and it was my fault."
            </p>
            <p>
             Walker had been an awkward teenager, with few friends and distant parents, and the Scoutmaster had been the only adult to take an active interest in him. He felt he had no one else to turn to.
            </p>
            <p>
             "If adults would have told me he had done this to other boys, that it wasn't just me, if the police were contacted, it would have totally changed everything," Walker says now. "It would have totally changed my life."
            </p>
           </blockquote>

            Admittedly, pedophiliac relationships do sometimes seem beneficial. A child may learn much from a consistent and caring adult lover and come to cherish him as a friend long after the period of erotic attachment has passed. (2)  Evidently West is a pedophile.  He was severely abused being that his brain and emotional system stopped at that very age.  Thus he seeks out those that are within that  age group.  I have read in reports on here that when a child is so abused, that is what happens, they cannot mature.  Thus he believes that there is nothing wrong with what he is doing.  WRONG Dr. West.  You are a sick individual.  Not only are you probably carrying out your beliefs, but you are teaching them and brain washing your students.

             "Seem" is the operative term.  Regardless of what it 'seems' it's utter fucking nonsense the pedo uses to further their push for unfettered access to kids and to gain support of enablers.
            </p>
            <p>
             "The poor child had no one but this loving old pedo!  Would you deny him the only love he has?"
            </p>
            <p>
             Bullshit.  The child ends up victimized beyond the physical sexual abuse and exploitation.  The child is robbed of childhood, of finding and making their own relationships, because they're servicing grandpa for room/board/hugs.  Any adult who truly cares about a child and interested in their well being will not be seducing them (and then blame the child!). You don't have seducing as the gold standard to "help" a child who needs consistent caring.  It's the biggest lie ever perpetuated on masses of people!

              They have totally convinced themselves of this lie.  Now they are trying to pass it on to others.  His saying would you deny him the only love he has is sick.  He is equating his sick perversion of sex as love.  Also he is asking people to have sympathy for this poor deprived child. All and all around he is a danger to society regarding the abuse he has committed and will keep committing and the constant diatribe of his sick perverted version of  "love" t o anyone that will listen.

               Exactly, it's a sick con game. Even more insidious, given how many times pedos take pics of kids to sell or trade amongst themselves, leaving kids self conscious and shamed, fearful that someone recognizes them (and people have).  Pedos need more troubled kids to prey on, thriving on more broken families and more orphans. And they expect us to believe that they're really just concerned to lovingly 'help' out with societal problems?  Pedos tend to be very prolific, sharing their "love" with many victims; it's their own distorted way of symbolically procreating a version of themselves (for those victims who grow up and repeat the pattern).

                Ugh.  When you say pedos sell  or trade pics among themselves, it reminds me of Baseball cards.  Like it is a sport of some kind.  They think of these poor kids as their "sport" just to toss them away and on to the next one.  How disgustingly horrible.  I believe they pushed the Woman's Movement to get Moms out of the home, to go to work and create latch key kids.  If you are well off enough to afford a baby sitter, fine, but they then made the economy so bad that almost all women had to go to work to supplement the family.   I am totally convinced this was all part of the plan.  Open season on the after school kids.  So very sick.  The pedos  are having a field day.

Dear Friends,

                  <p>
                   We have a home for street children of Kathmandu, in Nepal. At present we have 33 children and adolescents. They attentively follow the World Cup and you know how much sport is a great and beautiful thing and can be a formidable means for social reinsertion (especially for these children that have suffered so much for their tender years). Our children are passionate about football and they follow attentively how the World Cup unfolds. An attractive postcard dedicated by yourself, and by our dear ‘Mémé,’ for their attention (‘KIDS SHANGRILA’) would be a source of great pleasure to them. If, by chance, you could think about them, that would be marvellous!

                  "I did not like this at all. Until this point, my researches into CRIES members had led exclusively to those who had gone on to commit further sexual offences against children.
This was different. Regardless of the enthusiastic tones of Makhlouf in this email, I smelt a rat.

                  I discussed this with a lawyer that I knew, and she told me that she knew someone who was working with street children in Nepal. My legal friend contacted her and, surprise, surprise, it turned out that her association was called the Shangri-La Home. Did she know Jean-François Makhlouf?

                  Yes, she did. This is her email which she sent back, in double quick time, to my friend. The email appears in its original form. Not being written by a native English speaker, it contains one two grammatical errors. The capital letters and interesting expressions are all hers!

                    I would not be surprised.  Sports is one way they use to connect with these kids and it is really disgusting.  The poor kids get roped in thinking they will meet their hero or get help from a coach and they instead get a lifetime of sorrow and pain.  A dirty business indeed :(

            <p>
             West repeatedly refers to child sexual abuse as being consensual.

             Although sexual offences with children are predominantly non-violent and often in effect consensual…
            </p>
            <p>
             He claims that the majority of child sexual abuse is characterized by “affectionate playfulness and willing participation” and talks of a father abusing his child as being a “completely mutual relationship”.
            </p>
            <p>
             West praises and defends a notorious Australian child abuser called Clarence Osborne, and apportions responsibility to his child victims who “returned again and again” to their abuser.

            <blockquote>
             <p>
              As late as 1987, when more evidence had been published about the huge damage caused by child sexual abuse, West was still referring to child abusers as “child lovers”, described abuse as “mutually pleasurable experiences”, and talked of paedophiles seeking out “willing partners…much as ordinary lovers do”.
             </p>
             <p>
              It has already been emphasised that the vast majoroty of men who are sexually attracted to children ae non-violent in their approaches. Signs of fear or annoyance on the child’s part would normally make them desist. After all, child lovers are seeking, however inapropriately, an affectionate response and a mutually pleasurable experience. Paedophiles often develop great sensitivity to children’s reactions and are able to select, much as ordinary lovers do, those who are likely to prove willing partners.
             </p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>
             West criticises the law for criminalising adults who engage in “consensual” child sexual abuse, and suggests that the law should be changed to fix an age below which it would be assumed the child did not consent – “unless the contrary could be proved”. It appears the age he had in mind was very low indeed, as he gives the examples of “very young infants, even babies” who would not be expected “to appreciate fully what is happening or to formulate a complaint”.
