            I can foresee three main options (and combinations/variations thereof).
           </p>
           <ol>
            <li>
             WW3 - Somehow this Russian hack thing is true and they could prove that the Russian planted the most elaborate Hoax ever, keeping thousands of public researchers finding new information everyday all in a plot to have the 'usefull idiots' do all the work and jail the Clintons. This would mean an infiltration on US/Internet soil like never seen before, which cannot be left unanswered by the 600 Billion$ defence budget.
            </li>
            <li>
             They get away with it again and manage to imply harsh censorship rules. - All strings are pulled and the public will be fooled, none of this ever happened according to judges and this whole thing is a self incremenating false flag to implement strict Fake-News legislation that gives the power to some institution to completly curate the news for everyone. Making it impossible to ever question or doubt anything that is not in line with the 'truthkeepers'
            </li>
            <li>
             The top falls down. The critical mass became to big, aided by the collaborative research: officers, journalists, politicians now bound by an incredibly bizzarre power from above can't take it anymore and will spill out all the details. Might cause enormous hatred in the entire world against anything US. if someone  is anticipating and has a new plan when the old order falls there will be some clean up but after that things will continue in a new form and shape. If the scale of corruption turns out to be massive, things could get anarchistic as no normal person would trust anything governmental.
            </li>
           </ol>
           <p>
            All 3 are horrifying imho, the last being my favorite though.
