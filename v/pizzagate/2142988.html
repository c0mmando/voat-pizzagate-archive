            , if you aren't prepared to post actual research per our submission rules, this needs to go in

             Sincerely appreciate you reaching out with an EASY way to respond. I have wanted to ask many questions since I 1st found this site. Your rules are so complicated I don't understand them. Keep in mind whenever I'm on this site I am recovering from surgery, lengthy, debilitating illness, and way, way too tired to do much of anything. Therefore I can't understand complex rules that don't make much sense.
            </p>
            <p>
             No it does NOT make any sense to me at all. Rules are not at all clear. I must remember never to post anything. I am not skilled technically, nor on my laptop. I can only do the best I can. I wish there was a way to present my findings. Then it would be up to a Mod if it was worth posting for the group. I would be off the hook. The Mod can see that the post fits all of the rules as i don't know what I'm supposed to add. To me everything I've posted directly relates to pedogate.
            </p>
            <p>
             In the case of the man from another site who ran across pics that he suspected were related to pedo behavior, I agreed to help him by posting it on this site only seeking a 2nd opinion from those with more experience. That's why I tried to help.
            </p>
            <p>
             I have re-posted a few of the articles I've read here on other sites. Always there's a connection between the site (LSA) and info on why 500 girls yearly go missing from the same area. I I NEVER use anyone's names. I try to encourage others on different sites to read here for more info about the subject. Don't know the real rules on this issue.
            </p>
            <p>
             Why won't GLP let me link to VOAT?
            </p>
            <p>
             Why wouldn't Selena Gomez' music vid be OK when it directly relates to the girl killed for her organs and found in a hotel freezer? That's exactly how Selena's music vid ends. Except it implies the Chicago girl committed suicide on her own. That's definitely not true. I was able to uncover pages of info of what really happened. If you read what I found you'll see a clear pattern that obviously relates to organ sales. I did NOT report it on this site as I am sick of spending so much time trying to post only to have everything deleted.
            </p>
            <p>
             Today I read a post that is years old. The cited original author, Robert Downey Jr, was disproven soon after the 1st of the series was published. I would have said that and provided links to the much, much longer series. Again not worth being dissed for trying to help.
            </p>
            <p>
             I do NOT understand . what a "timestamped" vid means.  I never, ever understood what you wanted with the other articles I posted that got deleted. Maybe it would make sense to you that I've never been on Reddit as that's way too hard to figure out what's needed to post &amp; respond.
            </p>
            <p>
             There's a LOT of info I know having worked in the entertainment industry. Funny that paragraphs of what I wrote on GLP showed up here. I WISH they would not have used my GLP "name" however.

              Including the timestamp means looking at how far into the video the salient content occurs, and including that number, i.e. 3 min 12 seconds or whatever, in the body of your post so people can go right to it and see if the whole video is worth watching. That requires more than using the "Share a Link" button. You have to do a "Discuss" post and write up your premise, why you think it's relevant to the investigation of child sexual abuse by the global elite, and cite the content that supports that idea.

              I know the rules we have are challenging and much more rigorous than other subverses. The fact is, we are the most shilled locale on the Internet. We get dozens of posts every day that are put up solely to distract, confuse, and slide quality content off the board. It's hard to mod in that environment. The community agreed on the rules to combat the shills who don't want this investigation to go forward.

            I'm on the fence about this one. I can see where it might look a little suspicious, but it looks like the kids are related (possibly brother and sister), and just doing kid things. My personal opinion is it's not wise for parents to put videos of their children on YouTube, but that's a judgement call.  I didn't look at most of the videos, but most don't have many views, and those that do have more than a thousand have been up for a year or more and have click-baity words in the titles like "puke" or "poop".  I might be more suspicious if there were thousands and thousands of views in a very short period of time for no apparent reason, like the Elsagate videos. It's worth looking into, but there is nothing here that really sets of my radar. But I have been fooled before, and I know how devious pedos can be.

             Thanks for the ping Df8. I've noticed the shill upvote brigades have moved from 6 or so votes to around 12. Am seeing it on a lot of the very low quality posts.

              Ok faggot, riddle me this and I'll admit pizzagate is an "alt right fever dream". Why did Hillary Clinton's chief of staff have a blog in which she pimped out babies for "raw and uncut" online time? And why does the media refuse to acknowledge it while mocking the idea of child abuse existing in these elite circles? One thing's for sure, pathetic gaslighters like yourself ALWAYS pipe down when I bring out the Tamera Luzatto.card. Maybe you can buck that trend, not likely though.

               Ha ha everyone is a "faggot" too, I see.
You need to get some help, every one of you idiots. You live in a fantasy world of baby-eating monsters, kid fuckers, all sorts of fantasies that you cannot prove. You probably masturbate to your own ideas of pedos. Of course the media mocks this bullshit, because it's all fucking fake shit made up by creeps and failures such as yourself. Hilarious. Grow the fuck up.

            Poster on another site thought this YouTube Channel was suspect. I offered to re-post it "on another online site where feedback would be offered."  Don't know if anything can/should be done. Requesting advice.
           </p>
           <p>
            Apologies in advance if this is not a good fit for VOAT. One glance by clicking the link to the channel proves something to me is way, way off. I did not look at any of the vids so don't know the content.
