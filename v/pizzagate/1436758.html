           Hey guys. Tony Stiles has experience combating this stuff, and sadly, doing it on the internet isn't going to be enough. He asked me to share the following document with "Phase One" of a plan to actually dismantle this ring. Despite what many of you have said about me (I read all the comments on the thread about my interview with Tony.. Damn, a girl needs a drink after reading some of your comments) I am not doing this for any other reason than you-- to stop this sick shit once and for all. We are in deep. People are getting upset, and I am watching this community of people I consider to be the best in the world, devouring itself from the inside. It's getting nasty, and between people who are supposed to be on the same team. In any case, I am just trying to help, as this doc is coming from someone who has literally been in the field working this stuff, and knows a thing or two about it.
