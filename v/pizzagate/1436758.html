           Hey guys. Tony Stiles has experience combating this stuff, and sadly, doing it on the internet isn't going to be enough. He asked me to share the following document with "Phase One" of a plan to actually dismantle this ring.

People are getting upset, and I am watching this community of people I consider to be the best in the world, devouring itself from the inside.
