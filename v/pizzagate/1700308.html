<p>This is an excellent article that everyone should read that touches on the fact that pedos dress up: <em>Sophisticated pedophiles use mind altering drugs on their victims, wear masks and costumes, create bizarre scenarios, and use other techniques to try to obliterate any believability when the dissociated adult begins to remember.</em> <a href="http://thedirtiestsecret.blogspot.com/2008/08/pedophiles-know-dissociationdo-you.html">http://thedirtiestsecret.blogspot.com/2008/08/pedophiles-know-dissociationdo-you.html</a></p>
<p>Let\'s not forget about the case of Gabriela Rico Jimenez who said she escaped from a dungeon where Mickey Mouse was an abuser <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuJqidKLncg&amp;t=2s">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuJqidKLncg&amp;t=2s</a></p>
<p>To conclude this thread, I\'d like to mention that Cirque de Soleil recently announced that they are leaving Disney World with no explanation as to why they have made this decision. I\'m wondering if they want to distance themselves from the sorts of things that Disney is believed to be associated with in regards to pedophilia and other disturbing accounts that have been reported. After all, they are a circus with clowns, so I had to include this latest bit of news. <a href="http://www.clickorlando.com/theme-parks/cirque-de-soleil-says-la-nouba-leaving-disney-springs">http://www.clickorlando.com/theme-parks/cirque-de-soleil-says-la-nouba-leaving-disney-springs</a></p>
<p>As we\'re delving into the muck, we all need to remember that not all clowns are pedophiles, but we need to understand that these creepers use any and all means to coerce children into trusting them and hiding their identities to remain anonymous and create an image of craziness in the event the victim comes forward. </p>

            Glad you liked the post, and I'd like to know what's up with the creepy clown sightings, too. If I had the time, I'd cross reference any missing kids in and around the time and places they've been reported. I'm eager to see if they start up again this year. I know what I'd do if I one came after me as they have with others, so I have to wonder why they aren't afraid of getting shot. I mean, people have a right to defend themselves if a stranger is coming after them, so these people got serious balls considering what might happen if they scared the wrong, or right, person.

             Oh man. Sorry...I didn't like the way my post was worded so I deleted it (hoping I'd beat anyone responding to it) with the intention of posting a better worded comment. I know the sightings ramp up around Halloween but I somehow have gotten the feeling that there is something more behind it. Something far more sinister. Maybe I'm just prone to thinking that way but it would be great if someone interviewed all of the people who have been arrested for doing this. I know there have been several at least. Including a husband and wife team.
            </p>
            <p>
             Once again...sorry for deleting my original post out from under you.

              LOL! No worries, man. I'm reminded of the theory that there are serial killer cults as Ottis Toole said he was part of one and Gacy was rumored to have accomplices. Maybe the "killer" clowns reported are a part of some network?

               Oh, that Ottis Toole was a real piece of work. He's the guy who claimed to have killed Adam Walsh, wasn't he?

               I know WAY too much about serial killers. I love documentaries a lot! Argh! Now that's got me thinking of Albert Fish. That guy was straight up demonic!

                Sorry for just now replying, but yeah, he's the one who said he killed Adam Walsh, but he took credit for so many murders that nobody's really sure if it was him. Because he knew he was cooked and the fact that he was admitting to over 200 murders makes me believe even more that he was part of a serial killer cult and just decided to take the rap for his buddies and confuse authorities. I happened to catch a documentary about him on the Discovery ID channel on Monday night and had no idea that George W. pardoned him thus cancelling his execution because of so many lies he told. I say, "Who the fuck cares? He's a pschopathic murderer." Another smart move by ol' Baby Bush. I mean, of all the people he could've removed from death row, and he chose this guy.

                 Oh ho! Sorry to double comment on you but I just finished that article I linked and what to my wondering eyes should appear? George W. Bush also granted clemency to Henry Lee Lucas.
                 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Lee_Lucas">
                  Henry Lee Lucas
                 </a>
                 and as I scrolled down the Wikipedia page...what do I see?
                 <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/3/37/Henry_Lee_Lucas_and_Ottis_Toole.jpg">
                  Henry Lee Lucas and Ottis Toole were friends
                 </a>
                </p>
                <p>
                 This just lends even more credence to your theory!

                  Yes, they were partners, and I think I got confused. Now that you mention that, I think W. just pardoned Lucas and not Toole. The documentary was talking about both of them and when they showed W. speaking at the press conference about the pardon, I assumed it was Toole because that's who the documentary was mainly about and Lucas was a "supporting character" if you will. Thanks again for the link, and clearing that up. I don't believe W. pardoned both, but I'll look into it further.

                    Nice talking to you, too! Warning: don't be surprised if you end up binging on that YouTube channel. LOL! I sure did. I'm going to have to go back and watch the one about snuff films because I watched it years ago and now I'm wondering if places and names are coinciding with what we're learning with Pizzagate. Take care &amp; be well, my friend :)

                 I think you're definitely on to something there about taking the rap for other killers in a network. Makes a lot of sense.

                 Speaking of George W., are you familiar with the accusations of him being part of a satanic murder cult? This may not be the best link but I wanted to find something quick just as a way to introduce the elements if you haven't heard about it.

                 Not saying I believe there's anything to that stuff but it is fun food for thought. No worries on responding. I'm breezy, lol.

                  I had heard that W. was part of a murderous family, but not specifically a cult so to speak, and I never heard of the Matamoros Cult. Thanks for the link! Sounds fascinating.

                  I never considered how much W. and Bundy look alike, but I'm not convinced that they are one in the same because Bundy was many IQ points ahead of W., and much better spoken. QAlso, Bundy was extremely charismatic and W. is just goofy as hell.

                   Yeah, I don't think they are the same person. Although...I've always felt that George W. might be a clone of his daddy. But, that's impossible to prove.

                    Never thought about W. being a clone of Bundy! I don't discount the clone conspiracy, so who knows... you may be on to something.
