            Also to note there have been some people here whom have gone over to pedo forums and confirmed they are active on here, looks like they are also causing some of the rucus completely unaided. For some reason they are not overly enamored with our topics of conversation.

            If she or her YouTube channel suddenly disappear, then I'd be concerned. I think it's pretty common for public figures to get death threats when speaking on controversial topics.
           </p>
           <p>
            Sucks for her, but I think it comes with the territory. Being an investigative journalist includes an inherent level of risk. We have to be brave and accept that we might be harmed. The thing to keep in mind is the kids suffering every day.
           </p>
           <p>
            Would you risk your life to help save them? I know I would.
           </p>
           <p>
            We already know many key investigators have been suicided, but we cannot let that deter us. We must honor their sacrifice and continue the push for justice, even if it means more of us will die along the way.
           </p>
           <p>
            I'm ready to die for these kids. Are you?
