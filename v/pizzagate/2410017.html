<p>1969:Abortion No longer a Crime per Dr. Richard Day, a former Medical Director of Planned Parenthood-World Population and a Rockefeller protégée</p>
<p>&quot; Dr. Day gave his historic speech describing the &quot;New World System&quot; to the Pittsburgh Pediatric Society on March 20, 1969. Titled, &quot;Family Planning: Infant Mortality, Gene Frequency, Abortion and Other Considerations,&quot; Day\'s speech described in broad strokes, the New World System which he said was already in place and functioning. In his lengthy discussion of population control, he stated that in the future there would be &quot;sex without reproduction&quot; (aka contraception, sterilization, abortion) and &quot;reproduction without sex&quot; (in vitro fertilization, artificial insemination). Day\'s comment on homosexuality followed on the heels of his prediction that  &quot;Abortion will no longer be a crime,&quot; — that it would be accepted as normal and be paid for by taxes for those who could not pay for their own abortions. This was four years before Roe vs. Wade.</p>
<p>This is the island that Pedophile Jimmy Savile in the 1960\'s worked as a DJ offshore on the radio ship Caroline. His chauffeur (and alleged procurer) came from Isle of Man.
 Manx residents are considered British citizens but their laws differ from Britain. For example, a convicted pedophile in Isle of Man isn\'t tracked in England unless there\'s a specific court mandate from Isle of Man. Many of England\'s offshore islands have bad reputations for child abuse:

            , if we leave this up as you've written it, we're going to get a rash of crap for allowing non-pizzagater related threads. Please check over the submission rules, and rewrite your headline so that it emphasizes the pizzagate (Saville) connection, and put that material at the top of the post. So, something like "British offshore island, home to Pedo Saville's child procurer chauffer, may become late term abortion mecca" or something like that.
           </p>
           <p>
            I'm going to go ahead and flair this with our new 24 Hour Repreive flair. You'll need to remove it yourself, though, to edit the title, so we don't have to remove it per Rule 1 and 3. Thanks!
