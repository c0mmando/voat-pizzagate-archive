<p>Does Kamala want to take us back to the &quot;good \'ole days&quot; of pay toilets?</p>
<p>TAKE A TRIP DOWN MEMORY LANE.....

<p>Yes, Kamala\'s 2020 campaign is \'puttin&quot; on the BLACK.
First stop? WHY SOUTH CAROLINA, OF COURSE.</p>
<p>&quot;COLUMBIA, S.C. — When Kamala Harris makes her first trip this year to South Carolina on Friday, she’ll be surrounded by thousands of potential voters at a fundraiser hosted by a group of the state’s most powerful voting bloc: black women.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Harris is the only black woman running in a crowded field that’s expected to include more than 20 candidates. And, as a graduate of Howard University, she’s the only top-tier presidential candidate who’s an HBCU alum.</p>
<p>She’s incorporated those credentials into her campaign. Harris’ first stop after launching her bid on “Good Morning America” on Martin Luther King Jr. Day was Howard, where she joined the 300,000-member strong sorority as an undergrad and graduated in 1986. In 2017, Harris returned to Howard to deliver the school’s keynote commencement address.&quot;

<p>BUT WAIT!   Is Kamala really black? IS SHE THE DESCENDANT OF SOUTHERN AMERICAN SLAVES?
Notice, POLITICO does not call her African American. FOR GOOD REASON. And, according to photos I have seen, her skin is NOT BLACK. In fact, it\'s light brown, ALMOST WHITE.</p>
<p>Is there a reason for this? Is she committing RACE FRAUD? Minority votes are at stake. 
Let me put it this way, SHE IS THE REAL POCOHONTAS! She\'s 50% Indian.......Asian, that is.
BUT THAT\'S NOT ALL! She was raised by her India Indian mother, but her divorced father was JAMAICAN! Both of these immigrant parents came from prosperous families who could afford to send their children to the U.S. to get a college education. Kamala\'s light skinned Jamaican father reports that he descended from a prosperous IRISH Jamaican SUGAR CANE PLANTATION OWNER who imported IRISH SLAVES! The U.K even reimbursed him for the loss when they made slavery illegal. And yes, this is all documented. Let\'s follow Kamala\'s lead AND CLAIM TO BE WHATEVER SKIN COLOR YOU WANT IT TO BE, just like transgendering......TRANSCOLORING, the new meme!</p>

<p>&quot;Sen. Kamala Harris Remembers Indian-American Mother’s Journey In America&quot;

<p>&quot;Kamala is the daughter of Shyamala (Gopalan), a breast cancer specialist, and Donald J. Harris, an economics professor at Stanford University. Her father is Jamaican.....Her mother is an emigrant from Chennai, India, of Tamil Indian descent. A video of Kamala’s father can be seen here. After her parents’ divorce, she spent many of her teenage years with her mother and sister in Montréal, Québec, Canada, where her mother worked. Kamala was raised attending both a black Baptist church and a Hindu temple......Kamala is the second person of Indian heritage to mount a notable campaign for a major party’s nomination for President of the United States. Bobby Jindal, who ran for the Republican Party’s 2016 nomination, was the first......Kamala’s paternal grandfather was Oscar Harris (the son of Joseph Alexander Harris and Christiana “Christy” Brown). Joseph was a land owner and agriculture exporter. Christiana was said to be a descendant of Hamilton Brown, a plantation and slave owner, who founded the city Brown’s Town. Hamilton was born in County Antrim, Northern Ireland....Kamala’s maternal grandparents were P. V. Gopalan (the son of Venkataraman Iyer) and Rajam. P. V. was a diplomat for India.&quot;

<p>&quot;Legacies of British Slave Ownership&quot;
Hamilton Brown
&quot;Major attorney and resident slave-owner in Jamaica, the founder of Browns Town in St Ann Jamaica, where a memorial has been recorded: \'Sacred to the memory of HAMILTON BROWN Esq. Native of the County Antrim, Ireland who departed this life on the 18th Sept 1843 in the 68th year of his age. He was the FOUNDER OF THIS TOWN. Was 22 years one of the Representatives for this parish in the Honble. House of Afsembly. His name will long be cherished.\'</p>
<p>Hamilton Brown was instrumental in the importing of several hundred labourers and their families from IRELAND to Jamaica between 1835 and 1840.&quot;

<p>AFRICAN - IRISH SLAVES OF THE CARIBBEAN....Bred for COLOR!</p>
<p>“How Blacks have Irish Last Names”</p>
<p>&quot;King James II and Charles I also led a continued effort to enslave the Irish. Britain’s famed Oliver Cromwell furthered this practice of dehumanizing one’s next door neighbor.
The Irish slave trade began when James II sold 30,000 Irish prisoners as slaves to the New World. His Proclamation of 1625 required Irish political prisoners be sent overseas and sold to English settlers in the West Indies. By the mid 1600s, the Irish were the main slaves sold to Antigua and Montserrat. At that time, 70% of the total population of Montserrat were Irish slaves.
Ireland quickly became the biggest source of human livestock for English merchants. The majority of the early slaves to the New World were actually white.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;In time, the English thought of a better way to use these women (in many cases, girls as young as 12) to increase their market share: The settlers began to breed Irish women and girls with African men to produce slaves with a distinct complexion. These new “mulatto” slaves brought a higher price than Irish livestock and, likewise, enabled the settlers to save money rather than purchase new African slaves. This practice of interbreeding Irish females with African men went on for several decades and was so widespread that, in 1681, legislation was passed “forbidding the practice of mating Irish slave women to African slave men for the purpose of producing slaves for sale.” In short, it was stopped only because it interfered with the profits of a large slave transport company.
England continued to ship tens of thousands of Irish slaves for more than a century. Records state that, after the 1798 Irish Rebellion, thousands of Irish slaves were sold to both America and Australia. There were horrible abuses of both African and Irish captives. One British ship even dumped 1,302 slaves into the Atlantic Ocean so that the crew would have plenty of food to eat.
There is little question that the Irish experienced the horrors of slavery as much (if not more in the 17th Century) as the Africans did. There is, also, very little question that those brown, tanned faces you witness in your travels to the West Indies are very likely a combination of African and Irish ancestry. In 1839, Britain finally decided on it’s own to end it’s participation in Satan’s highway to hell and stopped transporting slaves. While their decision did not stop pirates from doing what they desired, the new law slowly concluded THIS chapter of nightmarish Irish misery.&quot;

<p>KAMALA, WHERE\'S THE LOVE FOR YOUR IRISH ANCESTORS?</p>
<p>&quot;My roots go back, within my lifetime, to my paternal grandmother Miss Chrishy (née Christiana Brown, descendant of Hamilton Brown who is on record as plantation and slave owner and founder of Brown’s Town) and to my maternal grandmother Miss Iris (née Iris Finegan, farmer and educator, from Aenon Town and Inverness, ancestry unknown to me).  The Harris name comes from my paternal grandfather Joseph Alexander Harris, land-owner and agricultural ‘produce’ exporter (mostly pimento or all-spice), who died in 1936 two years before I was born and is buried in the church yard of the magnificent Anglican Church which Hamilton Brown built in Brown’s Town (and where, as a child, I learned the catechism, was baptized and confirmed, and served as an acolyte).&quot;

            Does Kamala look anything like TRUE AFRICAN AMERICAN Martin Luther King?

           <p>
            According to her father's written account (with photos) regarding his ancestory, he only confirms that he was born in Jamaica and has IRISH ancestory. He does not mention AFRICAN ancestory. Kamala's mother is India Indian.  Therefore, Kamala is  first generation Irish-Jamaican-(Asian)Indian-American.
           </p>
           <p>
            WHY DOES KAMALA MAKE HER RACE ORIGINS AN ISSUE?
WHY DOES SHE NOT TELL THE TRUTH?

             DOES KAMALA HAVE THIS DREAM?
            </p>
            <p>
             "I say to you today, my friends, so even though we face the difficulties of today and tomorrow, I still have a dream. It is a dream deeply rooted in the American dream.
            </p>
            <p>
             I have a dream that one day this nation will rise up and live out the true meaning of its creed: "We hold these truths to be self-evident; that all men are created equal." I have a dream that one day on the red hills of Georgia the sons of former slaves and the sons of former slave owners will be able to sit down together at the table of brotherhood. I have a dream that one day even the state of Mississippi, a state sweltering with the heat of injustice, sweltering with the heat of oppression, will be transformed into an oasis of freedom and justice.
            </p>
            <p>
             I have a dream that my four little children will one day live in a nation where they will not be judged by the color of their skin but by the content of their character.
            </p>
            <p>
             I have a dream today.
            </p>
            <p>
             I have a dream that one day down in Alabama, with its vicious racists, with its governor having his lips dripping with the words of interposition and nullification, that one day right down in Alabama little black boys and black girls will be able to join hands with little white boys and white girls as sisters and brothers.
            </p>
            <p>
             I have a dream today. I have a dream that one day every valley shall be exhalted, every hill and mountain shall be made low, the rough places will be made plain, and the crooked places will be made straight, and the glory of the Lord shall be revealed, and all flesh shall see it together.
            </p>
            <p>
             This is our hope. This is the faith that I will go back to the South with. With this faith we will be able to hew out of the mountain of despair a stone of hope. With this faith we will be able to transform the jangling discords of our nation into a beautiful symphony of brotherhood."  -Martin Luther King

             Personally, I think she's the  Hillary replacement for the Rothschilds. They control India going back to the intermarriage with the Sassoon family and the Opium wars. India was the prime opium supplier back then. Linked to East India Co., later Jardine Matheson. Hillary's BFF Lynn Rothschild and hubby have major business interests there. That's why Hillary has frequently traveled there. "It's safe" Jamaica is still under the Crown's thumb.
Kamala's hubby is not black, he's jewish. As a matter of fact, so is the history of Jamaica:
