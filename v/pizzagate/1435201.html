Please do not bring your baggage, if you do not render right away, do not drag the rest of us into your nightmares... Do not wear clothing, or bring weapons, or bring anything from your childhood, chances are they have their own dreamers. Satanic dreamers will usually have no face and will lack a presence (ninjas), they are trained in deception, do not look at their dreamers in the face, ignore them, they will not be able to touch us, if we don\'t touch them or listen to them. IF YOU SEE CHILDREN DREAMERS, DO NOT TOUCH THEM EITHER... we cannot trust anyone, until we see how deep the tunnels go. I can only maintain this dream for about 4 hours before I go into seizures, so please... under the floor only for now... I need to see something, It was whispered to me to look for a wooden box, with carvings, inside there is a key. Bring this key to the gates, who ever finds it first, without hesitation, bring the key to the gates, do not even say you have it. There will be two twin girls wearing white dresses, they are the keepers of their secrets, do not follow them... do not play with them... do not take anything from them. The whisperer told me that the two girls are Satan\'s daughters... they tend to render in libraries. These two girls guard the key inside the box. Lets help our brothers and sisters the way we know best... remember the key in the box only, and under the floors. Oh, and imperative... don\'t move anything.</p>',
