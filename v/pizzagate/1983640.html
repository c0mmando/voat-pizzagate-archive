            didn't check out how many years it spans, but just looking at how many reported just in 1 day is alarming
           </p>
           <p>
            here's a link I found this morning
            <a href="http://www.dispatch.com/news/20170702/missing-children-missing-photographs">
             http://www.dispatch.com/news/20170702/missing-children-missing-photographs
            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            It can be a parent’s worst nightmare, and it happened almost 20,000 times in Ohio last year
           </p>
           <p>
            Rob Portman, Ohio’s Republican U.S. senator, drafted legislation to address the issue nationally. The Bringing Missing Children Home Act, passed in 2015, mandates that law enforcement acquire a photograph of the child within 48 hours when one is available.
           </p>
           <p>
            However, it appears that implementation of the law has been inconsistent in Ohio. A Dispatch analysis of the attorney general’s database in early June showed that among 558 missing-children reports, 71 percent had no photograph. That raised concern among experts and advocates.
           </p>
           <p>
            “It’s difficult to help find them without a photo,” said Theresa Flores, an advocate and human-trafficking survivor. “We can obviously see that it hasn’t changed ... Obviously, someone is not in compliance.”
           </p>
           <p>
            Here's another one on Ohio

           </p>
           <p>
            This one pissed me off

            McCain is up to his eyeballs in Pizzagate, and as for his Foundation, as corrupt as the Clintons, and his druggie wife is getting paid to make this speech
           </p>
           <p>
            McCain and Soros reportedly became friends after the senator was exposed as a member of the “Keating Five” during the savings and loan (S&amp;L) industry scandal during former President George H.W. Bush’s administration. As the S&amp;L bank chairman, Charles Keating paid $1.3 million to bribe five members of Congress to interfere with government regulators on behalf of the savings bank.
The experience so scarred McCain that he became a vigorous advocate of campaign finance reform and in the process reportedly became friends with Soros.
           </p>
           <p>
            McCain recently claimed no involvement with the institute, saying “I’m proud that the institute is named after me, but I have nothing to do with it.”
           </p>
           <p>
            and look where the donations are coming from

                 "Research shows that if a child is missing in Ohio for two weeks, “there’s a high probability that they’ve been approached by a (human-trafficking) recruiter,” said Celia Williamson, a human-trafficking expert at the University of Toledo."

            Have any of you experienced this in your own life? Let me tell you, NO ONE will help you find a missing child. Unless of course for some reason the media has picked it up that week to make everyone believe that they do.
           </p>
           <p>
            My son ran away as a teenager. Once they determine they have run away, you can just go fuck yourself because obviously you are a horrible parent and this is what you deserve. Long after my son returned on his own I found out that he had visited shelters in Portland OR and the officer in charge of his case KNEW this and didn't even tell me. When I asked why she just laughed. When I contacted police in Seattle they told me that they had in fact seen him and laughed about it and made jokes about how he was dressed. He was 14 years old.
           </p>
           <p>
            Until you experience it yourself you believe that people out there have compassion and actually care about what can be happening to children on the streets. I know better now.

              He's alive, all right is relative. He still hasn't told me most of the horrible things that happened to him during that time. It still irks me how dismissive the entire system is about this problem. When it comes down to it parents have few rights when it comes to their children. Its just that no one realizes this until you are in the middle of it.

             That's a horrific story. Didn't realize the authorities work against the parents.

             Fourteen is way too young to be out on the streets. He was at risk the moment he left the safety of your home. Did you blog/FB these officials? Publicly shame them and ask them to respond in writing as to why they didn't report to you? Did you call these idiot's superiors and demand an explanation? File a complaint? I know it all sucks that you'd have to do that, but it sounds like it's needed. Maybe get a petition circulating demanding answers.

              I'm sure you mean well but if you think about the situation - the entrenched protocol law enforcement is following to literally make sure the parents are not informed even when the child is located? - protesting to  $10/hr employees or even $60K employees?  would not do any good.
             </p>
             <p>
              Also, while this is going on, the parent would not have the time nor inclination to sit down and compose well written letters.  Any letter would most likely come off as half cocked  / angry.  At that point, law enforcement could come after the parent as a "terrorist"
             </p>
             <p>
              See the video here as to how the police used that excuse to run a guy out of town   and steal his house!

             </p>
             <p>
              On that same side of the coin, if CPS is called, they will find a reason to take the child from the parents after the kid is found.   They get big $ for that.
             </p>
             <p>
              This is the same situation found in state after state.  I do not know of any states where this is NOT the case

            this official site has 832 pages of what looks like 10 kids per page
           </p>
           <p>
            what surprised me were the amount of kids missing the same day and just how many of them have no picture
           </p>
           <p>
            on 6-19-17... 6 kids reported missing
           </p>
           <p>
            on 6-18-17... 8 kids missing
           </p>
           <p>
            on each day, only 2 had pictures
           </p>
           <p>
            on the 2 days, 5 were in Columbus County
           </p>
           <p>
            You would have to go through a lot of missing kids to get a count in each county
           </p>
           <p>
            2 days and Ohio has 14 kids reported missing

           <p>
            Thanks
           </p>
           <p>
            I am wondering how much "news" we actually hear on TV at all
           </p>
           <p>
            Was looking at the newspaper from Jul 2, 2017
           </p>
           <p>
            On the back page, among short paragraphs of news summaries, I saw one about  TWENTY FIVE people getting shot at a night club in Little Rock
           </p>
           <p>
            I'm like --- really??    I had not heard about this at all
           </p>
           <p>
            Apparently, it did happen:
            <a href="http://www.nola.com/crime/index.ssf/2017/07/little_rock_nightclub_shooting.html">
             http://www.nola.com/crime/index.ssf/2017/07/little_rock_nightclub_shooting.html
            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            What is my conclusion?
           </p>
           <p>
            Only False Flag shootings even get reported nationally.
           </p>
           <p>
            Real ones don't qualify.  Maybe the body count isn't high enough.
           </p>
           <p>
            VL had an interesting interview the other day.  This guy was living in Kalamazoo at the time of the UBER shooting, found out it was a False Flag and was ran out of town by local police
           </p>
           <p>
            <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RbldHCutEbI">
             https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RbldHCutEbI

           <p>
            It is an hour but worth it.
           </p>
           <p>
            His definition of a false flag
           </p>
           <p>
            LINK  This is where he talks about the definition of False Flags:
            <a href="https://youtu.be/RbldHCutEbI?t=763">
             https://youtu.be/RbldHCutEbI?t=763
            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            At the end, he talks about the MK Ultra program in the schools there.
           </p>
           <p>
            Another VOAT user posted a link to that same town awhile back...   The local non-profit   Prevention-Works, located at 611 Whitcomb,  ***
            <a href="http://archive.is/kLwzE">
             http://archive.is/kLwzE
            </a>
            **** sends people to the schools to educate 9-11 year olds about violence and drug prevention
           </p>
           <p>
            Coincidentally,  their address is the work address for a bunch of convicted Pedofiles.   ****

           <p>
            So they are sending them into the schools?  Or just using them for lawn maintenance men.   Hmmmm

             I have always wondered about her father.  Maybe I am wrong, but he always had a smarmy look about him.  Something just did not sit right about that case.  EDIT:  Just remembered his name.  Mark Klass.  He had none. I will have to look that case over again now that I have been red pilled.

              modesto area or that area near the presido i'm pretty sure. presidio or not, there's some sick shit up that way.  it's a bizarre case that was totally fascinating when i read everything i could about it years ago. dude asks for her by name in the house, takes her and not her friend, is discovered by cops on the grounds of a large estate (that i think was a pot growing place or some shit) while polly is like yards away but concealed in the woods and is let go by the cops. body found with all kinds of sick shit done to her. the dude seemed to have been obviously tasked with taking her specifically.  he calls out father in court basically implying pop is a pedo.  weird stuff

                i don't know what to think about her dad, and can't say i believe he was a pedo.  however, his daughter was targeted for some reason (and maybe simply cuz the killer-davis- and possibly others we're simply attracted to her).  i posted a couple links for further reading in a reply to another poster
