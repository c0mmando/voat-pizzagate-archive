            I have another theory..could the police have hired him to get into comet and do a search  without needing a warrant..am sure they locked down the restaurant for a couple of hours.

             Optimistic but doubtful. This was nothing more than a "see how dangerous fake news is" false flag. Now they can deem anyone talking about pizzagate as a potential threat. Talk about pizzagate in public as anything more than fake news and you had better believe some shill will report you to the authorities. Be careful out there.

               I'd point out though, that the cameras being turned away priot and then back afterward, is rather suspicious.
But I also seem to recall reading somewhere, that the camera redirection claim was disinfo?

               Another point of interest is the recent attack against the parent of a Sandy Hook victim(sic), which seems to be part of a pattern when coupled with the CPP shooter...

            All the foil hatters are claiming Sunday's incident was a false flag, lol. Worst, calmest false flag ever. Just for the sake of this discussion, let's entertain the theory that Sunday's incident was, in fact, a false flag.
           </p>
           <p>
            IF this was a false flag, then immediately, the Streisand effect took over and pizzagate was all over the mainstream media, causing even MORE people to research it and spread the information even further.
           </p>
           <p>
            It's much more likely that Sunday's incident was.. in fact.. someone emotionally charged, like so many of us have been, who thought he'd just storm the place and find all the evidence himself. He didn't find anything. He also didn't hurt anyone, so the "false flag" narrative is really, really silly.

             Actually false flag makes more sense still, the media is just somewhat incompetent. If they were aware of the Striessand effect and this wasn't a false flag, they wouldn't give it this much coverage.

             Yeah, tbh the jury is still out for me on him. The thing that does suggest it's a false flag is the camera.

             There's many valid points to suggest that it was a false-flag, calmer than usual, sure, but a controlled and scripted event nonetheless.

             The only problem is someone so enraged to go into a restaurant with an assault rifle doesn't have the mental clarity to calm down. It reminds me of a saying by tank crews. Once you load in a round it's only coming out on the other end. Once a dude loses his temper like Edgar did he ain't gonna calm down anytime soon. Ever hear of a near mass shooting? No? Me neither.

               Sigh.......No assault rifles aren't fully automatic (although they can be). They're not full automatic because armies the world over frown upon giving soldiers fully automatic weapons as you will very quickly run out of ammunition on full auto. Soldiers are INTENTIONALLY given weapons that only fire one shot per trigger pull, with a max of three shots per pull in some cases. Fully automatic is N shots per trigger pull as in as long as the trigger is pulled bullets are firing until you run out of ammunition..........Face Palm........I worry at the fate of my country..........

                In all cases, my M4 in the army was fully automatic and then semi automatic. Assault weapons must have fully automatic or burst fire capabilities. My point was I doubt that he was using a class III weapon and it's not a big deal I just get irked when people use that term

                 The M4 was never full automatic, having only single or 3 shot burst options. The M4A1 can fire fully automatic. Both are considered assault rifles. ;-)

              Emotionally charged doesn't mean enraged. It means he was motivated to go investigate. If he had his mind set on shooting people, he would have shot people. You are right, I've never heard of a "near mass shooting" and this wasn't anything like that.

              You don't know what was in his head, and it's foolish to think you are psychic and understand his thought processes. Where he comes from, in NC, open carry is fully legal. He may not have realized open carry was illegal in DC.

               So that's like the scene from Full Metal Jacket when Private Pile loses it and is in the head loading an M-14 and Sargent Heartman comes in and Private Pile says......"You know Sargant, you ARE right. My mommy and daddy didn't show me enough attention. After I lay my rifle down on the deck at my feet would you kindly escort me to the nearest mental health facility? ....Thank You!"
