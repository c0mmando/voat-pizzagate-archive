<p>I was assaulted at home in what is being investigated as an attempted hit job to silence me after I was doxed. I did not report on this openly to not scare others because those in real danger are the eyewitnesses not the researchers. I told only a few trusted members and moderator. </p>
<p>This involves a large law enforcement investigation that is on going with one in custody. Shortly after I was directly threatened with death scenes by <a href="https://voat.co/user/Are_we_Sure">@Are_we_Sure</a> who I stated was an agent. </p>
<p>I requested assistance from moderators who banned me not him....thanks <a href="https://voat.co/user/Vindicator">@Vindicator</a>.  Though some white hats did capture all the threats and pictures in a secure location amongst other identifying information before he deleted them....too late buddy.</p>
<p>After which I was forced to flee with help from witness protection as I was informed my life was in danger, which has been true for many years but intensified as I began talking and sharing my experience, training, and eye witness information on Voat and other places regarding pizzagate and other corruption.</p>
<p>I chose to go to the heart of evil and challenge them face on and provide evidence to others on Capital Hill who would do a fair investigation. </p>
<p>At the same time I and another whistleblower whose life has been under threat filed lawsuits against the Podesta Group, Clinton Foundation, FBI Brass, Fusion GPS, Pakistan Awan Brothers Spy Ring, and others. </p>
<p>I personally went to HQ in DC, all the Awan Brothers Homes, and many other locations to provide service of these lawsuits were are formulated to demand discovery and document production to expose this evil under extreme threat and with no protection except the courage of whistleblowers and victims to inspire me forward. </p>
<p>I have now visited Comet Pizza, Bucks Fishing &amp; Camping, Little Red Fox, Politics and Prose, and Besta Pizza. </p>
<p>I have photos and video that has been placed in a secure location should harm come to me. I was followed from Comet Pizza to a coffee shop by James Alefantis and another identified man and watched for intimidation. </p>
<p>I will attach some pictures to prove my point. The day after we served Podesta Group they folded, the day after we served FBI McCabe, Rosenstein, et all and exposed Peter Strzok and Lisa Page the texts were leaked. This included exposing who Rosenstein’s wife realky is. </p>
<p>I have sat through all of the hearings in Congress and Senate in the past few weeks watching the house of cards collapse. </p>
<p>My courage is out of desperation to survive and get the truth out but I carry in my heart the many victims who are in touch with me and the amazing researchers and whistleblowers involved. </p>
<p>I will provide a few pics I have to show the contact and being followed and watched by James Alefantis. Additional Video is in a secure location.</p>
<p>I would ask again for <a href="https://voat.co/user/Vindicator">@Vindicator</a> to unban my account <a href="https://voat.co/user/Jem777">@Jem777</a> I refuse to create a new account other than this one rarely used because I am determined to prove speech is indeed not free unless it goes along with the accepted line. </p>

            , I see what you are doing here, and shills have been at the same exact way for a year now. We have very clear rules that require supporting links for all major claims. You've already had one account banned for holding yourself above the community-establish submission standards for
            <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/v/pizzagate">
             v/pizzagate
            </a>
            . We have a sub for unsourced submissions, yet you continue to post here making wild unsourced claims, which you KNOW will get your post removed and if you do it enough, this account banned, too.
           </p>
           <p>
            This behavior is very telling. You are trying to undermine mods. Knock yourself out, sister. I am more than happy to ban you if you want me to.
           </p>
           <p>
            Removing per Rules 2 and 3.

            Wow... this is incredible. I've been following/active for a long time, but, took a very long break and followed GWS extensively while doing some deep dives of my own.

            - Assuming everything of what you said is true, which, I personally believe 100% based on some surrounding meta data - Thank you. And sorry that is all happening, but, thank you! If there's anything I can do to help out, let me know.

            - Thank you too... once again

           <p>
            I always said that if/when the PG research looped back around to the GWS research, this would be the ultimate crack in the dam. There is too much data on each side. Like the left/right of a dam slowly forming cracks and then meeting in the middle.

            Thank you so much, glad to be a contributor TF!

            These guys are CIA  &amp; and I wouldn't be messing around if I were you. They are masters of gaslighting and mindfuckery. You can be sure they know everything about you and have you under surveillance. They have technology we don't even know about, I know this without a doubt but can never prove it. That's part of gaslighting.

             We are required to ban accounts that flout the rules. Jem777 repeatedly posted on

             </a>
             without providing evidence to support claims, even though we have a separate sub for speculative, unsourced posts. I warned her repeatedly. She thinks she is above the rules. This post is another example of ignoring the rules, which I also have to delete, as

            Your problem here is you went directly to the delusion, These half wits, I mean woke af-wits need a lead to follow.
           </p>
           <p>
            My suggestion is you start on 4 chan and call yourself  Z. Then slowly build up your story. All these larpers start with real names and places, resist that and start with a time machine. Hillary or Bill, it doesn't matter, are or is stealing children from different time zones, specifically choosing the children who were about to be lost in wars through out history. It seems a boring cliche story, but here is the kicker, they're feeding those stolen children to the vampire Obama, whose power lights the ping pong and Besta swirls.

             JumpingJacks, being a troll or a researcher has nothing to do with it. People are banned for one reason, and one only: repeated disregard for the
             <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/v/pizzagate">
              v/pizzagate
             </a>
             submission rules, or Voat's User Agreement. Jem/Mej believes she is above these rules, and can cause hatred of mods for enforcing them by purposely posting here without sourced links, which all are required to do. She has been asked repeatedly to keep posts filled with unsourced claims in

              v/pizzagatewhatever

              I figured it out by looking at your Twitter. Pretending to be passing and receiving secret information. Considering your fascination with Webb it would not surprise me if you went and toured Webb's work and took pictures.

              What is BS is that you have super secret information from being an insider that is causing your life to be threatened. That is BS.

                You did not come here today to provide useful information. You came here to be a victim. Your style is to pretend to have secret information by using riddles and questions, as if the information is so secret that you cannot tell it. This you hope leaves your audience with the impression that you are an important insider. It also shields you from having to provide information that can easily be verified as not being secret.
