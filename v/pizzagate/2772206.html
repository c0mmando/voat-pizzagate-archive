<p>Murder in the Diocese of Buffalo?</p>
<p>NFSW for those that may experience upsetting results because of the description of the act of abuse upon a child</p>
<p>As events progressed, Fr. Moreno made what may prove to have been a fatal mistake, he got into a heated argument with senior chancery personnel and threatened — out loud — to expose everything he was meeting with them about.</p>
<p>That was Friday morning before he was found dead on Saturday afternoon. Father Joseph Moreno was found dead in his chair in the living room of his rectory with a gunshot wound to the left side of the back of his head.</p>
<p>There are immediately problems with this account. First, Fr. Moreno had bad nerve damage to his left hand and it was difficult for him to hold things. Secondly, he was right-handed. Third, his personal handgun went missing two weeks earlier, according to parish staff, so a big question arises: Where did the supposed suicide or homicide gun come from?</p>
<p>A very damaging fact against the suicide determination is that a second autopsy — arranged by his sister — discovered not just one bullet hole, but a second hole that had been sutured — reminiscent of mafia assassinations. </p>
<p>Another issue is the manner in which the supposed suicide would have actually occurred. According to officials, Fr. Moreno picked up the gun with his left hand and then reached around with his right hand and pulled the trigger.</p>
<p>So what remains unexplained is how Fr. Moreno could have shot himself without getting any blood spatter on his hands or in the room. Also, how was Fr. Moreno positioned so comfortably in his chair with both arms by his sides with no blood splatter of gunpowder residue on his hands. </p>
<p>His sister spoke with the local ABC affiliate about the irregularities.</p>
<p>Susan Moreno: &quot;There\'s no picture of the gun in his hands — his hands are closed. There\'s no blood splatter, blood misting on his arms, on the gun, on the wall where supposedly he did this at.&quot;</p>
<p>At the crime scene, the fax machine with the phone number of the local newspaper stored in its memory was not there — the fax machine he had used less than 24 hours earlier.</p>
<pre><code>Susan Moreno: His desk drawer was broken into. His file cabinet is missing, his current files are missing, his fax machine is missing. He did fax something to The Buffalo News the day of his death and I think it\'s relevant to get that four-page fax because Joey was going to expose something. What it was, I\'m not quite sure, but he was going to spill the beans on something and someone wanted him to be shut up and they did. 
</code></pre>

<p>Unsatisfied with the original autopsy and its finding, Susan spent a small fortune having his body exhumed and a second autopsy performed in 2015.</p>
<p>The medical examiner who performed the second autopsy, Dr. Cyril H. Wecht, said this: &quot;After examining the evidence, I am not able to tell you definitively that this was a homicide, but I do believe serious questions have been raised.&quot;</p>
<p>When news broke in October 2012 that Moreno had been found dead, the Buffalo diocese pushed the suicide narrative, offering no explanation as to why. No suicide note had ever been brought forward and Fr. Joe had made definitive plans for the following few days.</p>
<p>Bishop Malone, who was new to the diocese a few months earlier said he had met with Moreno the week before and the priest was reportedly upset that he was being transferred out of his parish. An article appeared shortly after that with anonymous priests claiming Moreno was a troubled individual with a checkered past, further trying to shore up the theory that he killed himself.</p>
<p>Malone is the same bishop who lied about the number of priests accused of abuse in his diocese, initially claiming there were only 42, when the actual number is 106. </p>
<p>Charlie Specht at WBKW in Buffalo has been doing a series of investigative reports exposing Malone\'s cover-up of multiple predator priests — his latest showing that Malone deliberately underreported the true number of homosexual abusers in his diocese by less than half.</p>
<p>Stay tuned to Church Militant as we dig more deeply into this disturbing report of what appears to be cover-up of a hit job against a whistleblower priest, a priest who was set to expose the homosexual network in the Buffalo diocese and was silenced before he ever had the chance. </p>

             Thank You.  This has incensed me to no end.  I will try to keep up with the story.  The Church Militant site is covering it.  More Wet Works.  More of the same. "Suicide"  by shooting yourself in the left side of the back of your head with your right hand with a gun that was stolen two weeks before.  Nothing to see here folks.

            Buffalo NY, eh? So...........how many generational officers, firefighters, politicians, etc.......are members of these churches?
           </p>
           <p>
            A man of "the cloth" is still just a man, but unlikely to commit murder. There will always be insiders needed, within local government, media, etc, to act as "clean-up crews".
           </p>
           <p>
            Someones name on that list, likely has a relative that is within the local government and also part of that network. That would be the best guess as to who murdered the priest. Then again, it could have been some homeless person, strung out on drugs........there seems to be a lot of those, which are conveniently vets, and easily used by cia. But in this situation, I'll bet more on the former, than latter.

             Indeed its not just the church,when this finally breaks wide open you will see the police, fire, and local figureheads all be exposed NATIONWIDE in America.
It is literally in every town, city, and State in America.

              It's not just the United States, alone. I agree.
There has been generational corruption of many, if not every lodge, in every city, around the globe.

              The lower level members have to decide. Will they remain silent and protect their fellow members? OR will they help expose this sickness?

             <p>
              Silence is consent. Consent is guilt.

             Although I put nothing past some of the evil priests we have read about, I agree that someone may have been sent to do this horrid job.  There are many that would comply to gain more power and money.  Also, I am sure jorge has people over here just in case.  Men of the cloth.  Well not anymore, since most of them are n longer t taking part in that vow of poverty.

               That's all there was to Preach/Teach
You can't have the new testament without the old testament, you cant split the "complete" book
Only religion does that, which is why it fails.

                A group of men(The Council of Nicea) hundreds of years after Christ's death, chose which books to place in the holy bible. None of those men were ordained to do so.
The old testament preaches hate and division. Christ spoke of none of that.

                These are my personal conclusions after 30 years of soul searching. I mean no offense to those with different views.

              I doubt any priests know Christ. They memorized the churches doctrine, for control and extortion.

               I believe there are a few, but as of late I am losing my faith in them.  They spit out words but I bet they do not believe and in the meantime someone is changing the teachings and writings as we speak.  But somehow I think there is change on the horizon.  People are terribly upset.  They comments are Epic. Anger.

                 The knowledge to know right from wrong.  It's what I was taught.  It's really pretty simple to know the difference.  I guess maybe for me since that's what my parents taught me.

                  I could find a thousand verses to share with you. I could go on about the things I know of the history of the RCC.

                  The shortest, sweetest thing I can say is just live the message (do unto others). How you interpret that is subjective. We are all sinners. Christ walked with the sinners and sickly, not men of the temples. He wrote nothing down. That was the beauty of his message. He knew it would be distorted. It was a message to outlive him, yet the simplest aspect can not be removed(do unto others). That seed is in all philosophies.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  Follow the teacher. You're here for your soul. No one else's.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  When you do unto others, is it for rewards here and now? Promises of rewards in the afterlife? 
If so, you've missed the message. Do unto others, for no reason what-so-ever. No rewards. No praises. No glory.
Do so because that is the way.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  Peace be with you. I have to log off for the evening.

            It’s especially hard on us psychologically to hear of abuse and cover-up from men of the cloth.  That’s not a random phenomenon or aspect to these cases.  Abuse.

             That is not something we would expect, no.  But there has been a huge infiltration of the RCC by those that wish to poison the well of our faith.  They are not the only ones for other religions are having the same problem.  There is debauchery and normalization of pedophilia and sexualization as well.  We must keep fighting.

               Yes.  They have the gall to include the name of Jesus within theirs  JESUuitS.  Blasphemy imo.

                 I have heard that the Jews were involved.  It may be a compilation of both.  They are always very sneaky about their names and messages.
