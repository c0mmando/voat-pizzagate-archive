            Someone puts photos of their children online with suggestive comments or symbolism or condoms/alcohol and their judgement is not questioned. Someone sees the photo and goes, "Wow that is inappropriate, this concerns me, I'm going to call out this concerning behavior," and that person is considered nuts or evil.

             The swamp gas keeps bubbling to the surface more and more often.
            </p>
            <p>
             The world is tripping, but also reaching a tipping point. Each new story and scandal adds weight to all those others that came before. More and more people are becoming aware of this sickness that has spread throughout humanity, and change is going to come quicker than at any time before.

            <p>
             Just look at how much they are fighting against #PizzaGate and #FakeNews. They are running out of ways to hide and are becoming more reckless and desperate. Their control over information is slipping away, so we must be extra vigilant against their attempts at overreach and silencing dissent.
            </p>
            <p>
             Thankfully we have places like Voat that are standing with us in the fight for freedom to expose wrongdoing.

             Anything suspicious should be screenshotted and archived on multiple sites.
            </p>
            <p>
             This new feature could be innocuous enough, and is similar to your web browser's built-in bookmark function. But knowing that valuable leads were obtained specifically from people 'liking' Instagram posts, this offers a hidden way to do something similar, that won't show up to anyone else who might be looking.
            </p>
            <p>
             Not saying this is a major issue, but every move these media fixtures make should be suspect, especially considering Instagram is owned by Facebook, who have shown a willingness to work for the dark side on multiple occasions.
