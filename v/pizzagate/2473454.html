<h1>Hillary\'s $30,000 Fans Are Her \'\'CULT\'\' Following</h1>
<p>A purported pyramid-scheme operator who was run out of Arkansas when Bill Clinton was governor has reinvented himself as the head of an upstate group accused of being a “cult” – and his devotees have pumped thousands into Hillary Rodham Clinton‘s presidential run.</p>
<p>Executives and top associates of the Albany-based NXIVM group – along with their family members – donated $29,900 to Clinton’s presidential campaign, according to federal records.</p>
<p>On March 14 and April 13, records show, more than a dozen contributions poured into Clinton’s coffers from NXIVM, an executive and group-awareness training organization led by Brooklyn-born Keith Raniere, 47.</p>
<p>Most were from first-time political donors, each giving the $2,300 maximum.</p>
<p>The revelation comes on the heels of the arrest of Norman Hsu, who raised $1.5 million in campaign contributions for the Clintons and other Democrats, even though he was technically a fugitive from fraud charges in California.</p>
<p>Hsu jumped bail in early September but was nabbed and is currently locked up in California. ...</p>
<p>Three of the March and April Clinton pledges came from Raniere’s most high-profile followers: Seagram heiresses Clare and Sara Bronfman, and Pamela Cafritz, daughter of D.C. A-listers Buffy and Bill Cafritz.</p>
<p>Cafritz shares a condo with Raniere.</p>
<p>The Bronfman sisters are also deeply involved with NXIVM and, according to a 2003 article in Forbes magazine, have loaned millions to the group and provided use of their jet.</p>
<p>Their father, Edgar Bronfman Sr., once took NXIVM classes but soon severed ties, telling Forbes, “It’s a cult.”</p>
<p>The Clinton campaign downplayed the significance of the NXIVM-related contributions.</p>
<p>“Over 100,000 people from across the country have contributed to Sen. Clinton’s campaign for change, and regardless of who supports her, she will always continue to stand up for what she feels is right,” said campaign spokesman Blake Zeff.</p>
<p>Hillary isn’t the only Clinton NXIVM officials are attracted to.</p>
<p>At least three of them – group President Nancy Salzman and the Bronfman sisters – are members of Bill’s charitable organization, the Clinton Global Initiative. Membership is by invitation only and requires at least a $15,000 donation per person for one year.</p>
<p>NXIVM spokesman Frank Roberts told The Post the organization doesn’t have a presidential candidate it is officially backing.</p>
<p>Last month, the Albany Times Union reported that NXIVM associates gave $31,600 to the state Republican Senate Campaign Committee and provided $34,763 worth of air transportation. ... </p>
<p>A 1992 Arkansas lawsuit filed by Bill Clinton’s then-attorney general, Winston Bryant, charged Raniere, Cafritz and two others with fraud and business deception. Soon after, then-New York AG Robert Abrams sued CBI, branding it “illegal.”</p>
<h1>Raniere didn’t admit wrongdoing, but agreed to pay hefty fines in both states. ...</h1>
<p>At NXIVM – according to court papers, cult watchdogs and relatives of members – Raniere has defrauded devotees, shattered families and drove at least one person to suicide.</p>
<p>After four months attending NXIVM’s expensive, “intensive” studies, Alaska resident Kristin Marie Snyder grew angry, depressed and irrational.</p>
<p>In winter 2003, she disappeared. Her family believes she drowned herself. Her body was not recovered. Snyder was last seen leaving a NXIVM course, and police released a note she left behind.</p>
<p>“I was brainwashed and my emotional center of the brain was killed/turned off,” Snyder scrawled in a spiral notebook.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Again: </p>
<blockquote>
<h1>Raniere didn’t admit wrongdoing, but agreed to pay hefty fines in both states.</h1>
</blockquote>
<p>Okay, so it states he paid hefty fines, but remember, this is Slick Willy and The Cannibal Queen we\'re talking about. A deal could have been forged between them that jail time would be averted for sending money their way. Get it? Got it? Good. </p>
<p>Now Fiji: </p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://frankreport.com/2017/11/28/will-keith-raniere-return-to-perfection-if-not-in-spirit-at-least-in-fiji/">https://frankreport.com/2017/11/28/will-keith-raniere-return-to-perfection-if-not-in-spirit-at-least-in-fiji/</a></p>
<p>So will Keith return to perfection? Or will he have to admit he is one of the most highly flawed human beings on the face of the earth? Will he use Mexico to maneuver secretly to someplace else? How about Tahiti?</p>
<p>Or will he return to his fools followers in Clifton Park?</p>
<p>Wakaya Island might be nice if Clare Bronfman is in the mood to host him. Fiji is a hard place to extradite even a Raniere, yet it is a small island and it will not be hard to know he is there. He can run there but he cannot hide.</p>
<p>Which brings us back to our original question: Where is Clare Bronfman?</p>
<hr />
<p>On <a href="https://www.mailcharts.com/emails/ec074c5e-1b75-f5cc-ec1a-1e8cf66f3c0b">https://www.mailcharts.com/emails/ec074c5e-1b75-f5cc-ec1a-1e8cf66f3c0b</a> , the glad tidings were announced that Clare Bronfman assumed ownership of Wakaya from David Gilmour, the founder of Fiji Water and original developer of the long uninhabited Wakaya Island, as of August 11, 2016.</p>
<p>Extradition in Fiji is almost entirely contingent on the amount of money the resident of Fiji possesses. It is inexpensive to purchase residency in Fiji.  The judiciary in Fiji is rated by several watchdog groups as among the most corrupt in the world, which of course is ‘perfection’ for Keith Raniere.</p>
<p>Now, doesn’t this seem better than shacking up in a condo in Monterrey?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yeah, it may be one of the most corrupt places on earth, but not when you have a POTUS who ANTICIPATES the problem and has already worked out a deal. </p>
<p>Can I get an Amen? </p>
<p>In one fell swoop, the cabal is going down! </p>
<p>Please keep checking this post. I\'m going to be adding to it.</p>

             Absolutely this is bigger than just this cult. It's tied into something huge. We've learned that pattern.

            <p>
             Whether it's a star, a corporate leader, product pusher, or politician, if the person is plugged into this cabal, they are successful and given protection. It means law enforcement and the press lay off of what is going on.

            There is another secret group, for men only, called 'Society of Protectors', run by Raniere.
           </p>
           <p>
            <em>
             This reveals Keith Raniere's charming thoughts about women:
            </em>
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             <strong>
              Society Of Protectors designed to protect men’s mastery over women
             </strong>
            </p>
            <p>
             It is an organization where men pay a fee to learn the truths of manhood according to Keith Raniere...
            </p>
            <p>
             All the members of SOP must sign an agreement wherein they promise never  to speak to anyone – male or female – about the teachings they receive from Raniere.
            </p>
            <p>
             Its website claims it “helps men to become more powerful and influential members of society by giving them tools and a network of honorable men for support. SOP is not only curriculum, it involves practical tests to strengthen us with respect to readiness, responsiveness, character, honor, strategic thinking and leadership.”
            </p>
            <p>
             Among the teachings are:
            </p>
            <p>
             Men control the world.  Women are subordinate to men.
            </p>
            <p>
             Men are polygamous by nature. Women should accept the polygamy of men.
            </p>
            <p>
             The stronger the man, the more women he can own and control.
            </p>
            <p>
             <em>
              NSFW
             </em>
            </p>
            <p>
             Men cum on women’s face or bodies to claim ownership of them. If a woman accepts his cum, he owns her.
            </p>
            <p>
             Women desire to be with one man. But women are fickle and opportunistic. Women don’t keep their word and don’t have character.  They will leave a man if they find a better protector or provider. They are like fleas jumping from dog to dog till they find the best host.
            </p>
            <p>
             In the beginning, a man may lie about having sex with other women.  She must first be made dependent on him.  They act like princesses. When they don’t hear what they like, they become hysterical babies.  Women are babies who can’t handle the truth.
            </p>
            <p>
             Once they become dependent on a man, then they need to be humiliated. Women are always getting away with breaking their word in society without any consequences. Men should get them dependent – and  then let them know they are not valued.
            </p>
            <p>
             Telling them then about other women trains and degrades them at the same time. This is good.
            </p>
            <p>
             A man should seek out his women’s flaws and weaknesses and bring them to her attention. If the woman is defiant, she should be mocked, insulted, scorned, debased, given penance, punished, neglected and banished in that order.
            </p>
            <p>
             Women should maintain the weight they are told. Wear what they are told. Keep their hair as they are told. They should wear an adornment to show they are owned by a man, such as belly chains and hot iron branding on the body to mark the man’s ownership. Women should be willing to find new women for their man.
            </p>

             What I noticed when reading the list:
            </p>
            <ul>
             <li>
              <p>
               There is a 'Society of Protectors' - seems to be comprised of husbands of DOS women - needs some investigation.
              </p>
             </li>
             <li>
              <p>
               Two of Nancy Salzman daughters are DOS members
              </p>
             </li>
             <li>
              <p>
               DOS women have to report nefarious activities of their husbands, and this is used to blackmail them when they want to leave. Question: Is it also used to blackmail the husbands while the women are still DOS members?

             Most people got that it was to point something out. And some brilliant people connected it to the owners or Fiji Water. They were tweeting links to bios, but I don't remember anyone having this.

              I mean... I never lost faith in him per se. I just don't think he's the hero of the ages. And I DEFINITELY don't interpret every miniscule thing he does as if it's intended to be some sign. Here, let me do a migratorypatterns impression.

               LOL, pretty spot on.

               Tbh, I never had faith in him. He's a billionaire elite who was mentored by Roy Cohn; plus the fact he "used to be" friends with both Clinton AND Epstein. Let's not even start on the things he has admitted to doing ("grab em by the pussy" ring a bell?), or the comments he's made about underage girls, including his daughters. If it walks like a duck and talks like a duck...
              </p>
              <p>
               Plus the odd timing of the Podesta emails that kicked off Pizzagate in the first place. They were released 30 minutes after Trump's pussy tape was leaked, which leads to a whole other rabbit hole. This whole thing reeks of an orchestrated event designed to make Trump look good. Judging by how right-wing and Trump-centered this board has become, I'd say it was pretty successful.

                He has skeletons in his closet to be sure, but mostly I just think he's crass an somewhat un self aware from years of not needing to give a shit. Us normies have to care what people think because we have to depend on each other for other daily bread and butter. It makes us better people. The longer one is filthy rich, the more that erodes. You can say anything and it doesn't matter. I don't think Donald is a pedophile or a rapist. Is he a womanizer? Ohhhh, definitely. Just me though.

            David Gilmour, from Wikipedia:
           </p>
           <p>
            Early life
David Harrison Gilmour was born in Toronto in 1931.[1] At age 16, his father offered him the option between enough cash to start his own company, or a $10 stipend a day to go traveling in Europe on his own.[1] He chose to go traveling, and believes he learned how to become an entrepreneur by observing other people on his travels.[1]
           </p>
           <p>
            Career
He created his first company, Dansk Design, an importer of Scandinavian furniture and giftware.[1][2] He then founded TrizecHahn, a real estate firm.[1][3] In 1958, he co-founded Clairtone, a stereo maker, with
            <strong>
             Peter Munk
            </strong>
            .[1] They then bought property in Fiji and started the hotel chain called the Southern Pacific Hotel Corporation.[1][3] Less than a decade later, they sold it for $128 million.[1] They then bought a $40 million gold mine in Northern Ontario, and co-founded
            <strong>
             Barrick Gold
            </strong>
            .[1][3] He also bought Zinio, now one of the world's largest electronic distributors of magazines, books, catalogs and apps.[1][2]
           </p>
           <p>
            Fiji
He later bought Wakaya Island in Fiji.[1][2] In 1996, he co-founded Fiji Water with Peter Munk, after he found an aquifer in Yaqara Valley on Viti Levu.[1][2][4][5] It became the No. 1 brand of imported water, even before Evian.[1] In 2004, he sold it to Lynda Resnick for US$50 million.[1][6] He also founded Wakaya Club &amp; Spa, a luxury resort on Wakaya Island.[2]
            <strong>
             Prince Felipe of Spain
            </strong>
            and his wife Letizia,
            <strong>
             Nicole Kidman
            </strong>
            and her husband
            <strong>
             Keith Urban, Bill Gates and his wife Melinda, Steve Jobs, Rupert Murdoch, George Lucas, Michelle Pfeiffer, David E. Kelley, Robert Zemeckis, Paris Hilton, and Tom Cruise have all stayed in the resort.
            </strong>
            [2][3] He has also built a village and a school for his Fiji workers.[2]

             Yeah, but you know these success stories. They're almost always fantasy. Like Paul Mitchell. Had nothng to do with anything other than being in 
the right cabal. And those guests! A Who's Who of Pedowood!

              The funny part is Gilmour's name jumped off the page as I thought it was DG from Pink Floyd.  It wasn't, but turned up a bit of a trove.

            So Him drinking water is a clue that he is the hero to this Satan syop?
            <br/>
            Voat mascot is a goat, goats are clues that Satan is involved, just like when we see owls, lighting bolts, perymids, the 666 hand, the One eye closed.
This voat is a controlled opposition alt right. 
M.I.A tweeted to laddy gaga to come see JA and have cookies and tea. She came to see JA in a witch outfit.
Lady haha is involved with MA spirit cooking.
JA is running from rape, sex slave grooming.
BM that dumped DOD files turned into a transgender probably living large as a "woman" in a man's jail.
