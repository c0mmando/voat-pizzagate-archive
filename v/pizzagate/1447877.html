            Probably an intentional reference.  What you should know about Ted Gunderson, though, is that he was a COINTELPRO disinformant. COINTELPRO is an FBI program aimed at disrupting dissidents. His goal was to "poison the well," giving talks to groups of conspiracy researches to get them to adopt bad evidence and false "tinfoil hat" versions of their theories (e.g. "no planes on 9/11"), in order to discredit the true general claims (e.g. 9/11 = inside job) with the general public. He promoted the claim that there were NO PLANES on 9/11, and he promoted the McMartin Preschool case as an example of an elite pedophile ring. The McMartin case is a well-known case of false allegations. The mother who made the initial allegations was crazy. She based it on her son having disrupted bowel movements. The jury exhonerated the accused because video showed the interviewers basically coercing the toddlers into saying they were abused, using leading questions that violated California guidelines at the time. One of the kids sent an apology to the LA times as an adult. That case was the real case of false memories that spawned the whole concept.  I have seen claims that he has connection to The Temple of Set (founder was Michael Aquino, Presidio military abuse case perpetrator), and that he married Anton LaVey's widow (can't find reliable source on that yet).

            Nice find...i remember the game but not the character.
            <a href="http://fallout.wikia.com/wiki/Ted_Gunderson">
             http://fallout.wikia.com/wiki/Ted_Gunderson
            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            Character BIO: 
While accompanying his father to the Ultra-Luxe, Ted Gunderson was mistakenly kidnapped by the faction of the White Glove Society loyal to Mortimer, who intended to serve him at a special dinner designed to convert the society to cannibalism.
           </p>
           <p>
            When Ted's identity is discovered, however, Mortimer voices his new unwillingness to serve Ted, and requests the Courier to find a new "main course" to continue on with their plan. Mortimer also gives the Courier the option of killing Ted, and framing his father for the murder.
           </p>
           <p>
            Strangely, if you use the Cannibal perk to devour him, the White Glove Society won't notice, since Mortimer's intention was to do the same.
If you rescue him, but kill his father on your return to the casino's entrance, Ted will follow you until he dies. He won't be controllable like a regular companion.
If you try to enter through the Strip North Gate with Ted following, the guards will kill him because he doesn't have a passport.
While rescuing him, Ted is unable to sneak, until when you are attempting to interrupt Mortimer in his speech during the conclusion of the quest, Beyond the Beef.
When talking to Ted in the freezer, selecting the talk option "Your dad's powerful. Someone wants him to feud with the White Glove Society." will have him call them the "White Pants Society", instead of
            <strong>
             White Glove Society.
