            THE mother of a 12-year-old boy who was murdered by a devil-worshipping stalker condemned as "a terrible joke" a report that concluded yesterday that his death could not have been prevented.

            But yesterday's report, which took 18 months to compile and made 59 recommendations, concluded that Diego's death "could not have been foreseen". Jane Held, director of Camden Social Services who spoke on behalf of all the agencies involved, dismissed suggestions that the report was a "whitewash".

            <p>
             Plans to promote a police officer criticised over the death of Poppi Worthington to the role of chief constable have prompted anger.
            </p>
            <p>
             Michelle Skeer, the Deputy Chief Constable of Cumbria, has been chosen as the preferred candidate to take over the force’s top job in the spring.
            </p>
            <p>
             Ms Skeer was one of the officers criticised by the independent police watchdog over the force’s “unstructured and disorganised” investigation into the death of 13-month-old Poppi in 2012.
            </p>
            <p>
             The announcement of her potential promotion sparked calls for Cumbria police to be scrutinised. Barrow and Furness MP John Woodcock said: “This move to put an officer personally criticised over Poppi Worthington failings in charge of the whole constabulary gives fresh impetus to our calls for a public inquiry to restore confidence in the force.”
            </p>
            <p>
             Prosecutors are still considering a coroner’s finding that Poppi was sexually assaulted before her death in in Barrow-in-Furness.

            </p>
            <p>
             It came to light as he put his client’s mitigation to the court before Hall, of Wilmslow, was jailed for 15 months for indecently assaulting girls as young as nine.

             This whole thing started with a posting on paste bin.  I then typed in one of the names in France and it showed he was the BF of Ashe.  The rest is history because that spurred us on to research so much more.  This was about a month ago, so it is hard to refresh my memory on it all, but what really stood out to me was What the Bleep was Branson doing standing in the middle of that Grayrigg Train Wreck.  Also YES the Rainbows are now being featured in their Foundation Ads and YES the cover up of that poor little child.  What is spells out for me is that there is some type of underground cover up and nonsense going on in that town.  WHAT was Branson doing there is my biggest question.  Is he connected to that school or the Garden Charities.  Let's not forget Raninbow Cultural Gardens  Schools connected to NXIVM and Branson also connected to NXIVM.  Yes this is Another Rabbit Hole.

               Kendal /ˈkɛndəl/, anciently known as Kirkby in Kendal or Kirkby Kendal, is a market town and civil parish within the South Lakeland District of Cumbria, England.
              </p>
              <p>
               Tobacco and snuff - Snuff production in Kendal dates from 1792, when Kendalian Thomas Harrison returned from Glasgow, Scotland, where he had learned the art of snuff manufacture.
              </p>
              <p>
               Kendal's early prosperity was based largely on cloth manufacture. In the 19th century it became a centre for the manufacture of snuff and shoes; the K Shoes company remained a major employer in the town until its factory closed in 2003.[13] There are still a number of industries based in the town, such as Gilbert Gilkes &amp; Gordon (manufacturers of pumps and turbines), James Cropper paper makers (based in Burneside and who make, at no profit, the paper for the Remembrance poppies for The Royal British Legion), Mardix (switchgear), Lakeland and

            Guys I know I may be beating a dead horse here, but I'm still really concerned about that UK girl, Zoe Adams, who attempted to murder her boyfriend as a "human sacrifice". The Daily Mail's article on the case said she testified to the judge that she was under psychiatric for depression and that she suffered panic attacks during sex. Her whole story screams SR abuse, plus there was something about her face that didn't seem right, something familiar and slightly off.
           </p>
           <p>
            First I took her mugshot and blew it up, When I did I discovered that her left pupil appears misshapen. Her face is fairly symmetrical, and I didn't think of the pupils til I read this whole post about JP Ash. Then I remembered why she seems familiar. The picture where Podesta  is playing cards with a bunch of kids has a girl that many were speculating may be Maddy McCann. However, that girl bears an uncanny resemblance to Zoe Adams. The girl is looking down to her left, so you see more of here eyelids from that angle. Also in the mugshot Zoe seems shocked with her eyebrows pulled up in a bewildered facial expression. However their mouthsize, nose size, the rt side part in both girls' hair, and the inner space between their eyes all look the same when blown up. 
Where was Podesta playing that mysterious card game? In the US? In the UK? And is that Mr Podesta or Mr. Ash playing cards in that infamous photo?
           </p>
           <p>
            Because of her apparent misshapen pupils, I have renewed suspicions about her situation. What drives a seemingly sweet girl, according to her family, to stab a man so hard that she punctures a lung, at her small size? During sex, which she seems to have a problem with?
           </p>
           <p>
            Knowing that JP Ash is active over there only makes me wonder MORE what has been happening to foster &amp; fatherless kids (like Zoe). If it's epidemic, like many of us believe, we should see more bizarre violent acts committed by many victims Zoe's age, not less.
           </p>
           <p>
            Am I reaching too far? Or is her crime a symptom of a larger problem? Is she part of a larger pool of victims who will act out?

             Never think you are reaching too far.  That is how we have arrived at the most amazing answers and evidence.  It certainly puts JP Ash in the right place.  Coloboma is what you are talking about regarding the eye.  Yes, Maddie had Coloboma.  I think I mentioned that there might be SRA involved with this girl as well.  With these perverted morons memories are just as easy to eras as develop.  We just had a post this morning about the Dr. connected to NXIVM and the patent for erasing the memory.  SO.  I think you are really on to something and very much agree on the SRA angle.  I also think this so called bf Kiernan needs more looking into.  He mentions he is deathly afraid of clowns.  Tip off.  Clowns is a pedo code.  Also it says in an article that she is a young mother.  A young mother at the age of 17?  Something is def off with this whole case.  I don't believe for one minute she did this on her own.  Yes, there could be a Maddie connection.

             Wow!  I remember that the police raided CR house while he was in Portugal (of all places Pedo Central).  Prince Harry.  Well, I believe Mountbatten might have gotten to him.  Diana was scared to death, I believe that what had happened to Charles would happen to her boys.  They are both afflicted, imo.  Sad.  When I look at their babies I want to vomit.

              How far did police go to protect Jimmy Savile?

             </p>
             <p>
              The photograph of the old man with the wild eyes and wispy grey hair has long been removed from the walls of the
              <strong>
               Flying Pizza in Roundhay, Leeds.
              </strong>
              But during a busy lunchtime this week at the bar of what was his favourite restaurant, the ghost of Jimmy Savile lingers.
             </p>
             <p>
              The Flying Pizza and his nearby penthouse apartment overlooking Roundhay Park were, until his death two years ago, the centre of Savile’s Leeds empire.  He would swan in at least once every few weeks, boasting to regulars of his celebrity status. It was like he had the “keys to the city”, one recalls. What seemed at the time like mere celebrity bragging is now known to be much, much worse.

              "The ex-Leeds City Police officer, speaking under the alias Paul Leonard, said that in 1965 he had come across Savile’s Rolls-Royce parked in a secluded lay-by near Roundhay Golf Club. The then DJ and fledgling television presenter reportedly warned: “I’m waiting for midnight when she turns 16… so p--s off if you want to keep your job.”
              <strong>
               After reporting the incident to a sergeant, Leonard says he was told: “Shut up, son. He’s got friends in high places.”

              And don't forget, Savile had a bunch of friends who shared the same interests.....which begs the question whether the same network still exists. Prince Charles btw, was a good buddy of Jimmy.

               Yes, so Jane Held who was Chair of Leeds Safeguarding Children Board at the time must have known. Now she's chair of one of the biggest fostering and child care networks in the country, Acorn... and someone linked Podesta to this.

            OOH You Are Good!  T Y for taking JP Ash &amp; Sons to the Limit and finding what you did.  The Kent address was found but you had the tenacity to take it further.  This is an Amazing discovery.  You have found that Acorn is connected to Rainbow Trust.  This Rainbow name has been used all over the place.  Think Rainbow Cultural Garden which has been connected to NXIVM and Raniere.  I propose people start being very suspicious about such a name.  When looking for a name last night in UK I discovered how many Rainbow org. there were.  Tons.  Just a thought.  Amazing Discovery!

              Rainbows Everywhere.  Rainbow Names and Rainbow Logos are all over.  They started this with the Gay community.  Pushing the Rainbow Symbol.  It is all over the place now.  Remember the Rainbow in the Wizard of Oz, Somewhere Over the Rainbow and Over the Rainbow has meaning in MK Ultra as well.

             <p>
              QUESTION: What is the meaning of a rainbow in the Bible? What do colors such as red, blue, and purple mean?
             </p>
             <p>
              In the Genesis account, a rainbow appears right after the great worldwide flood brought in order to remove sinful and evil-minded man from the earth. It symbolized God's mercy and the covenant He made with Noah (representing mankind) not to destroy the world in such a way again.
             </p>
             <pre><code>12. And God said, "This is the sign of the covenant which I make between Me and you and every living creature with you, for everlasting generations: 13. I set My rainbow in the cloud, and it shall be the sign of the covenant between Me and the earth . . . and the waters shall no more become a flood to destroy all flesh. (Genesis 9:12, 15, HBFV)
</code></pre>
             <p>
              Now am I saying they believe in God?  NO!  But they are good at hijacking what we believe to be good and Turning It Into Evil.   Rainbow used as Good but Evil is hiding in plain sight.

               Thank you for bringing up the true meaning of the rainbow ! They have twisted it and slapped our creator right in the face and they know it ! That's the scary part . To knowingly twist things written in the Bible to their own likings is a grave sin . Their time is short and they won't stop till the end . This is where we have to use discernment.

                Yes, all religions have been twisted.  This rainbow thing is especially confounding and egregious.  Blasphemous, imo.

                YES!  The Colors of the Rainbow.  They don't always just use the Rainbow but the Subliminal use of the Colors.  Hiding in Plain Sight as always.
