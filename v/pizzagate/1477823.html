Children refusing experimental medications were surgically implanted tubes to allow direct injections of drugs into their stomachs against their will.

The Associated Press discovered that this special protection never materialized in most cases.  It is also worth noting that HIV tests are well known for inaccuracy, and false positive tests can be triggered by routine conditions such as flu infections.  The research funded by the National Institutes of Health spanned the country.  It was most widespread in the 1990\'s as foster-care agencies sought experimental treatments for their HIV-infected children which were not yet available in the marketplace.  The research was conducted in at least seven states: Illinois, Louisiana, Maryland, New York, North Carolina, Colorado and Texas.  They involved more than four dozen different studies.  The foster children ranged from infants to late teens, according to interviews and government records.  Several studies enlisting foster children reported that patients suffered side effects such as rashes, vomiting and dramatic drops in their infection-fighting blood cells.  One study reported a "disturbing" higher death rate among children who took higher doses of the drugs.
>Supposedly, the federal government provided special protections for child wards in 1983.  They required researchers and their oversight boards to appoint independent advocates for any foster child enrolled in a narrow class of studies involving greater-than-minimal risk, and which lacked the promise of direct benefit.  Agencies in Illinois and New York attempted to displace their responsibility by requiring that pharmaceutical researchers sign a document agreeing to provide this protection on their behalf -- bypassing the spirit and true meaning of the law, in order to allow the foxes to continue guarding the hen houses.  One must wonder just how profitable these partnerships were for the bureaucrats to disregard a law written specifically to address their past behavior.  Researchers and foster agencies told The Associated Press that the conductors of AIDS drug trials commonly ignored the requirement to institute impartial child advocates, even though research institutions promised many times in writing to do so.
>Illinois officials believe that none of their nearly 200 foster children in AIDS studies received independent monitors.  New York City could find records showing 142 (less than a third of the 465 foster children in AIDS drug trials) got such monitors, even though city policy required them.</p>
