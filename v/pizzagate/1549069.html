<p>Following are two video links with more background on this, and most details (so I\'ll spare you, just watch one or both of these):<br />

<p>The original poster of this Instagram content is listed as &quot;alexandramigoya&quot;, which appears to be an actual (not pseudonymous) name. For the record, and though I have no independent method of verifying this at present moment, there is a D.C. based attorney by the name of Alexandra Marya Migoya listed inthe Washington, DC white pages. </p>
<p>As per a standard, public Google search, Ms. Migoya appears to be an alumnus of Cornell U, former corporate attorney, and former on staff in-house counsel at OutsideGC ( outsidegc.com ).  <a href="http://cornellalumnimagazine.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=1169&amp;Itemid=56&amp;ed=25">http://cornellalumnimagazine.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=1169&amp;Itemid=56&amp;ed=25</a></p>
<p><a href="http://cdn2.hubspot.net/hub/62401/file-2335534568-pdf/Outside_GC_Alexandria_Migoya.pdf?t=1421170126197">http://cdn2.hubspot.net/hub/62401/file-2335534568-pdf/Outside_GC_Alexandria_Migoya.pdf?t=1421170126197</a></p>
<p>Ms. Migoya does appear to be currently employed in the legal field in Washington, DC. And according to her LinkdIn profile, Ms. Migoya is listed as one of two authors of a book, &quot;“Egalité, Liberté ..... Infidelité? Musings on French and American Sexual Behavior,” Women, Femininity and Feminism in the 21th Century: American and French Perspectives&quot;, published by Palgrave McMillan in 2009 - as well as having authored / partially authored several other books. </p>
<p>As I said, I cannot be 100% certain that this is the same person, yet she is the only perosn of this name which surfaces in Washington, DC under a standard Google search, and since she is an author there are several pages of listings. So, I will proceed with the remainder of this report AS IF this is the same &quot;alexandramigoya&quot; whom posted the once-Censored Instragram  image.</p>
<p>PROS  1. It is possible, likely perhaps, that the Instagram post under consideration is perfectly innocent, and may have been taken out of context.*   2. There are children involved (and on this point, Ms. Migoya can rest assured, any such concerns are perhaps equally shared by those inquiring into Comet Ping Pong).   3. In retrospect, the original poster may have had misgivings upon realizing that an otherwise innocuous post became associated with a general, public investigation into odd, or perhaps bizarre string of social media posts related to Comet Ping Pong and Jimmy Comet (James Achilles Alefantis).</p>
<p>[*FOOTNOTE: I wonder if it dawned on initial pizzagate posters that what may have been being described in the text was the PARTY, depicted, after which they would leave to the parents\' address for the SLEEPOVER (not depicted, nor further described)... and under normal circumstances, any message such as this might be described like this. However, &quot;Pizzagate&quot; everybody now knows, did NOT evolve under anything resembling &quot;normal circumstances&quot; such as a police intervention, court case, etc - in which instance, as a misunderstanding based perhaps upon clumsy wording by supposed claimant, the perceived &quot;offense&quot; or &quot;hasty risk assessment&quot; on part of pizzagate citizen investigators happened without any direct communication or clarification on the part of either party, but instead via third parties, so the error and &quot;rush to judgement&quot; on both sides might be completely understandable.]</p>
<p>All that might be perfectly true. Equally possible are the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>Ms. Migoya may have information, may have heard rumors or innuendo, etc., regarding Comet Ping Pong and thus may not wish to speak publicly (or speak at all) about Comet Ping Pong or James Achilles Alefantis, nor perhaps to be further associated with either (understandable).   2. Ms. Migoya may have reacted in the best interests of children\'s privacy, without due regard to common sense or First Amendment rights to publicly available information, as posted.  3. The law might just be a huge &quot;gray area&quot; where this kind of thing is concerned, and that does appear to be the case to a large degree.</li>
</ol>
<p>In any case, this is what I have been able to determine SO FAR. If I have injured the original poster of the Instagram feed in any way, or otherwise slandered, maligned, or harmed their reputation, then I expect this posting will be removed forthwith. Again, this entire report is tentative, subject to correction, and based solely on publicly available information, based upon a standardized Google search using applicable search terms.</p>
<p>Likewise, if I have exercised &quot;reasonable&quot; restraint and common sense in this use of publicly available information and public-interest reportage, then I expect the post to STAND, as is.</p>',

              Look, I'm very much a big believer in Pizzagate and have helped uncover some of its breaking stories, but even I have taken my kids and their friends out for frozen yogurt and even pizza I think at some point as part of their sleepover evening/night. Let's not let Pizzagate ruin every last shred of innocence we have IRL. I've looked into this lead before and concluded that the mother was most likely bombarded with inquiries and was horrified to see her family and pictures linked to Pizzagate and did what every parent in her position would do - go offline.

               Yeah, so sorry. I read it completely differently and now I get what you are saying. I thought the sleep over was at CPP and now I get that it is going out for pizza before the sleepover. My bad.

              Let me explain...  girls this age like sleepover parties.  If my daughter wants her friends over for Ihe weekend what does a parent do for meals? Cooking for kids is a headache but cooking for kids that aren't your own is  aaagh.  Kids can be pucky eaters. It requires a lot of thiught so the house has snacks they like and meals. The parents are in charge of buying food.
             </p>
             <p>
              From a parents point of view it just makes sense to START the daughters weekend pyjama party with a  pizza party, lunch  maybe burgers,  dinner ...
             </p>
             <p>
              Oh god I'm  headaching just thinking about what to feed these kids and this is just a what-if example.
             </p>
             <p>
              Do you get the picture?  If you have daughters or were a girl,  this would make complete sense to you.

            Seriously. A mom took four kids to a pizza place (double sleepover = each daughter had a friend sleepover) before their sleepover (at the parent's house). They "kicked off" the party at Comet Pizza. That is all there is to this. And if I were that Mom, and a lawyer, you can bet I would be on the phone/email and pretty outraged to get that shut down before these children were exploited (yes exploited, teased by their friends etc.) due a well meaning group of public investigators alluding to something. Sometimes we just reach too far.....I don't think there is anything here.

             If perfectly innocent, why was The Daily Sheeple website shut down over it? A polite request to remove the image from the Sheeple website would have sufficed. Conclusion: it's not at all innocent.

             she/he never contacted the SOURCE of the report, and therefore no "understanding" was ever undertaken between the various immediate parties. Likewise, in the rush to get potentially relevant pizzagate information out to the public (a valid concern, and perhaps even "reasonable", considering how much formerly public social media has "vanished" since this began), inadequate attempts were made to identify specific posters with relevant posts, yet a separate miscommunication might have occurred.
            </p>
            <p>
             Both reasonable positions, both based on lack of direct communication. But then again, exactly how does one approach a potential poster regarding some of the more bizarre social media fare, honestly? And "pizzagate/Comet/Alefantis" social media in particular is far from normal fare, some of it bordering on the purely psychotic, BDSM, cannibalism, etc etc... so there is a good case to be made for "cause for alarm" and "the public's right to know", vs. an equally good case for "rights to public privacy", which were somehow waived whenever ANY OF US signs on or signs up for these social media services, TO A VERY LARGE DEGREE.
            </p>
            <p>
             I'm not making any judgements, but frankly I think Alefantis is filling his own pants with manure when he says it would be "expensive to sue" - what he's really saying is more like this:
            </p>
            <p>
             "I COULD sue you, but I haven't actually got a case, because I signed the same shitty legal agreements for FB, Instagram, etc that all you idiots signed, and so we're ALL IN THE SAME BOAT in that respect, and since I don't want to waste my money making myself look like a complete idiot in court, and possibly exposing myself further, I'm just going to (fill in the blank)."
            </p>
            <p>
             And if only that's all it was, I'd agree.
            </p>
            <p>
             So yes, I'm pretty sure that in this instance, cause for "immediate concerns" and "public's right to know" would outweigh any petty cries for "privacy!" when any user of these platforms pretty much SIGNS AWAY THAT RIGHT to a large degree (via "sharing agreements" and hosting rights), as well as rights to material and/or even up to copyright in some instances, as being deemed to the platform and/or hosting provider equally.
            </p>
            <p>
             Check and mate, on privacy concerns.

            i recall this pic the week pgate started...seems like a typical start "kickoff" to a sleepover party for some kids. Nothing weird...kids and a parent(s) going out for pizza before a sleepover back at their home. i personally think this would be a time waster to look into...just my opinion

                 The Daily Sheeple website was shut down because of this photo. To my knowledge, this is the only website to be shut down because of a Comet-related Instagram. It was done without any kind of prior communication with the Daily Sheeple. Their ISP did it off their own bat. You'd have to be very powerful indeed to be able to get an ISP to just shut down a website it's hosting at once, without even asking the website to remove the image first. There is clearly nothing 'normal' about a photo that can provoke this kind of response.
                </p>
                <p>
                 There was a theory that the picture contains steganography and that that is the reason this happened. If it does, no one seems to have decrypted the hidden image so far.

                   The problem with this thread is that most people don't know the back story. People keep starting new threads, making it look to newcomers like the subject hasn't been dealt with before and then the discussion proceeds in a manner that is isolated from what has already been learned.

             she has prior business dealing with Alefantis...she's organized the "auctions" at his sketchy art gallery (that posts not art at it's website)... and such, which I believe she may be trying to hide.

            <p>
             AS WELL, Alexandra Migoya's alumnus paper states she has two children, girls... well, of the four children in the Comet photo, only one appears to be her daughter (as shown elsewhere, see edit of original post). So yeah, this is relevant.

               not necessarily. It's just been proven that Ms. Migoya has a very direct association with J Achilles Alefantis, by way of Transformer Gallery. That in itself may well be innocent and fine, and yet it also raises an entirely new set of questions.

             yeah, it should be considered that the reactions of former corporate lawyers are not the "average", and hence the censorship.
            </p>
            <p>
             Other parents/guardians of children in social media posts associated with Comet? They've chose simply to remain silent - which is actually not a bad approach. I mean, what to you say:
            </p>
            <p>
             "Sure, we're just like James Achilles Alefantis and WE DON'T CARE, in fact we're possibly going to threaten you, your family and your progeny for exposing the fact that I OWN A BUILDING..." [heavy dramatization]
            </p>
            <p>
             or, likewise, the equally incredullous "This was all a huge misunderstanding."
            </p>
            <p>
             Either way, the information was publicly available. Either way, this is no "ordinary" case, being buoyed by a list of coincidences that rival 9-11, the Sinking of the Titanic, or Bilderberg Meetings and "sudden need for escort services". I mean REALLY - people seem to forget one thing:
            </p>
            <p>
             TRUTH IS YOUR BEST DEFENSE, whether in journalism, potential "libel", or defense... unless of course you're guilty, or foolish. Meanwhile, Pizzagate investigators are genuinely concerned about genuine concerns, about kids, potential for criminality, our government, and frankly the entire state of democracy in American society today.
            </p>
            <p>
             That a pretty tall order, and a wide-ranging, very important, compelling concern, and it seems to center around John Podesta and 
"gang", Comet Ping Pong, and James Alefantis. It doem't really help when you have someone like David Brock (Alefantis's former lover and partner) seeming to publicly explain that Alefantis and Podesta may now be having an affair ("relationship").
            </p>
            <p>
             It also doesn't really help that the average "citizen journalist" has precious little training in the field. We DO need more "pros" here, if for no other reason that to help set good examples for sober, solid reporting. We already have excellent investigators... we just need to keep this team working together, and keep making progress. And remember:
            </p>
            <p>
             I may have eaten in an Italian Bistro one evening while the people at the table next to me took a picture - and there I am, blissfully unaware, smiling at the camera and chewing mastacholi. Meanwhile, dude in the picture (unbeknownst to me) is a huge Mafiosi, who ends up dead in the alley out back later that evening. Next morning I wake up to FIND MY IMAGE ON THE FRONT PAGE OF THE MORNING PAPER, cheeks bulging, smiling, in the background with said Mafiosi, and every news website between the two coasts.
            </p>
            <p>
             But does that make me the "assassin"? Not at all. Do I even KNOW the Mafiosi guy? Hells nah - but there I am, thanks to social media.
            </p>
            <p>
             Not all lemons are sour. Not all arrows are "poison". Not all who wander are lost.
