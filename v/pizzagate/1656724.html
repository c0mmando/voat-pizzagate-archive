            What do we know?  We know that Mike Pence strongly advocated that Flynn be fired and that Flynn was forced to resign based on what Pence told Trump.  That is a fact based on what both Trump and Pence said.  But the reason they gave seems pretty flimsy.  It seems more like an excuse than a reason.  It was not enough to fire somebody they really liked and wanted to keep.  We know that Flynn's son was removed from the transition team for tweeting something about Pizzagate.  But think about it.  I am not sure I believe Steele.  Why would Flynn be comparing lists of pedifiles with the Russian ambassador?  If it were true it would be a serious incident because Russia is famous for exploiting weaknesses and blackmail.  If Flynn actually did compare lists it SHOULD disqualify him. May have nothing to do with who is on the list.  But I think he is too smart.  I don't think he would do anything that dumb.  I think Flynn was canned because he is not a neocon.  Since then, Trump has appointed a lot of neocons.  But I worry about Pence and Priebus.  Their body language around Trump is creepy.  Trump is operating in good faith.  He wants them to be a bridge with Paul Ryan.  The problem is Paul Ryan.  I do not think anything is going to change until the evil Globalist Pedifiles are rounded up and arrested.  That is the key.  I am not sure where Pence or even Trump stand on that.

            The Salacious Ammo Even Donald Trump Won't Use in a Fight Against Hillary Clinton

            In the late 1990s, Virginia Roberts was recruited to perform a massage for Epstein while working as a $9-per-hour locker room attendant at Mar-A-Lago (at 15 yrs. old - Florida legal working age is 16). (Groomed and culled from Mar-a-Lago by Trumps lesbian/hebophile friend Ghislaine Maxwell, who implicitly works for Jeffrey Epstein). Roberts' father also worked at Mar-A-Lago, which is located about 3 miles away from Epstein's estate, as a maintenance manager.
           </p>
           <p>
            During this same period, Epstein and Maxwell were repeat guests at Mar-A-Lago. In 2000, they hung out there with Prince Andrew, who arrived for vacation on Trump's private plane. That same year, the Palm Beach Post reported that Trump, Epstein, Prince Andrew, and Maxwell were all at a tennis tournament/celebrity event at Mar-A-Lago.

              Well, the link is a good place to start.

             <p>
              But if you'd like me to do your digging for you it would be my pleasure, Virginia Roberts name is all over the internet.
             </p>
             <p>
              Many of these sources fail to mention HOW Epstein initially met Roberts, like this link below, that implicitly states her father brought her to Epstein's mansion. Her father WORKED FOR TRUMP AS A MAINTENANCE MAN AT MAR-A-LAGO, and she was a towel folder in the pool and sauna areas at 15. This was where the initial meeting took place and I believe this affidavit is skewed intentionally toward that premise. I believe miss Roberts is under extreme pressure by some party to  keep this aspect of the Epstein case just below board
              <em>
               because
              </em>
              of the elections, that in and of itself says alot.

Teenage girl recruited by pedophile Jeffrey Epstein reveals: Bill Clinton Snared In Pedophile Ring: From Kosovo to Iraq
Posted on March 28, 2014

                https://theremustbejustice.wordpress.com/2014/03/28/teenage-girl-recruited-by-pedophile-jeffrey-epstein-reveals-bill-clinton-snared-in-pedophile-ring-from-kosovo-to-iraq/
               </a>
              </p>
              <p>
               "…Clinton was friends with an unnamed woman who “kept images of naked underage children on her computer, helped to recruit underage children for Epstein… and photographed underage females in sexually explicit poses.”"
              </p>
              <p>
               "The Clinton’s war in behalf of the islamist Albanian mob 1999, vs. Serbia, helped establishment of the black hole of the European security. Kosovo has been the final destination for numerous kidanpped girls and boys for over a decade.
For example, in their three-month investigation, GlobalPost has uncovered mounting allegations that the highest levels of the U.S.-backed Kosovo government are involved in this human trafficking.
The victims of the trade are typically minor and teenage girls who are kidnapped, seduced and often forced into what amounts to sexual slavery. There is prostitution in Kosovo that services the international community, the U.S. and NATO military forces and the U.N. and aid workerts who operate here. But more frequently, investigators say, Kosovo is a trafficking hub for children and women sold into prostitution rings in the United Arab Emirates, Israel, Western European capitals and elsewhere. Much has been written about these victims, but less has been written about the men who carry out the trafficking."
              </p>
              <p>
               "According to Global post investigation, some senior political figures, specifically former KLA commanders, were indeed involved in the trafficking of women and little girls. Furthermore, GlobalPost has obtained several intelligence reports from NATO military and intelligence services that also claim senior former KLA commanders have been involved in the sex-slavery business. Further bolstering the claims, various well-informed people, including a former NATO intelligence official who worked in Kosovo and a Western diplomat with experience in the region, all say that it has been common knowledge in American, NATO and U.N. circles for years that the former KLA terrorists,  commanders — many of them now in positions of great power in Kosovo — are believed to be linked to sex-trafficking and child prostitution.
After the occupation of the Serbian province the child prostitution, that has been an unknown phenomena, started to boost. A UN peacekeeper in Kosovo, who asked not to be named, spoke: “Often, even  the Muslim girls are sold on by other brothel keepers. They are traded like cattle and are routinely beaten and drugged. If a girl tries to escape, she is raped or tortured — or told that her mother back home will be killed.”"
              </p>
              <p>
               Now what was General Flynn doing in Kosovo? Was he there?

            steele, based on some of his earlier written stuff, sounds like a ranting manic. Some of it may be true but I bet he is bipolar and doesn't know how to censor himself.  I do believe that Flynn may have said either or both of two things to upset the Intel community:

           <ol>
            <li>
             <p>
              stuff to keep Pence from getting "house of cards" ideas and promote himself
             </p>
            </li>
            <li>
             <p>
              stuff to squash any idea of war with Russia

            I'm highly suspect of Robert Steele.  He is brazenly accusing a Republican US Senator of being a pedo, and highlighting the friendship with Mike Pence.   This behavior reminds me of somebody who has no fear of repercussions.  It is the trademark of the pedo rings/CIA cult.   If he truly were a ex-Cia operative who has gone rogue, he would know how dangerous this game is and would show more restraint.    His decision to go Alex Jones means that this information would be ignored by normies and the press, so Steele's message was targeted at us.  We are supposed to start looking into Mike Pence and Reince Priebus etc.   They are trying to set the internet sleuths against each other, and against individuals in Trump's administration.
        Notice also, that Hillary Clinton was the first to associate Flynn's departure with Pizzagate with her (and her former staffer's) tweets.   Then this guy pops up out of the blue to say the same thing.   I don't buy it.

             I remain neutral at the moment, but I have a prescription for the problem: keep cataloguing the facts. If we do a good job of digging into the most important facts, we will likely eventually see who the liars are and who are the good informers.

             I agree I think they're trying to create divisions in the Trump camp and amongst patriots, Alex Jones needs to exercise a bit more discretion as to who he has on his show

             Another contender is Dennis Hastert.  He had a lot of kids I am sure in the pipeline for other pols.  I think he is connected to a lot bigger ring within the big pool run by the Bushes and Clintons.  Could still be Flake, but I read something before on here that he is linked in someway to Hastert.
