<p>We hear this so oft these days it might seem somewhat boring</p>
<p>To be yawning at yet another ‘trigger warning’</p>
<p>But this cautioning I issue is not just to the sensitive
 
But to anyone who’s sane and decent and unfamiliar with what pure evil is</p>
<p>When Wikileaks released Podesta’s emails during the 2016 election</p>
<p>Anti-corruption investigators found much of what they were expecting</p>
<p>But a few sleuths curious about some peculiarly cryptic messages</p>
<p>Wondered what was meant by some out of place references</p>
<p>The frequent mentions of cheese and pizza but clearly not in relation to food</p>
<p>But seemingly some other indulgence in an encoded clandestine ruse</p>
<p>
Follow the evidence, go down that rabbit hole</p>
<p>But be prepared to relinquish all innocence in your soul</p>
<p>For what at first seems like unusual coincidences</p>
<p>Soon transform into some rather disquieting inferences</p>
<p>And following these clues and suggestions you just might</p>
<p>Wonder whether disquiet should rather be usurped by creeping fright</p>
<p>And should you persist, clicking links in internet explorer</p>
<p>At some juncture the undeniable overwhelms and you puke your guts out with the horror</p>
<p>
And you start to reassess all the clues over the last decade the media mentioned</p>
<p>That you thought too preposterous to really pay attention</p>
<p>Like when we ignored the trail of jet smoke from the Lolita Express</p>
<p>That Bill took on 26 occasions to a convicted billionaire’s nefarious island nest</p>
<p>Or the peculiar case of Laura Silsby, busted abducting 33 kids from Haiti </p>
<p>Whose lawyer and his wife also have child trafficking convictions</p>
<p>So why was Silsby set free by authorities at the insistence of one Hillary Clinton?</p>
<p>Or when the co-Huffington Post founder died after tweeting that John Podesta</p>
<p>Should be a global household name as a master child molester</p>
<p>And one of the coroners that examined how Breitbart came to be deceased</p>
<p>Died of arsenic poisoning on the day the report was to be released</p>
<p>
And a hundred other scandals linked like the head of the BBC</p>
<p>Smothering Saville’s case for decades, and now he’s the chief editor for the NYT</p>
<p>Who just removed the news of arrests of massive Norwegian child abuse</p>
<p>While so ardent to persuade readers of the dangers of ‘Fake News’</p>
<p>And where is the FBI, the arrests? well there’s certain procedural frustrations</p>
<p>They can only refer cases to the DOJ heads – who are also, in these emails, implicated</p>
<p>
And you start to see the extent of the web spin further, </p>
<p>abduction, rape, torture, murder</p>
<p>and can you explain the statistics of missing children ‘round Washington DC</p>
<p>and why they vastly eclipse per capita those of other States and Counties</p>
<p>And parents allege the cognitive dissonance required to accept the explanations</p>
<p>Of the incompetence in their missing children’s bungled investigations</p>
<p>
And you ponder how it’s possible that such predatory depravation</p>
<p>Has in the world’s most powerful people an inexplicable over-representation</p>
<p>And that’s when it clicks – that this insanity has a perverse logic </p>
<p>That no sane and decent person should ever hope to be forced to think</p>
<p>
For everyone knows ever since the Godfather by Mario Puzzo</p>
<p>That organised criminality observes a certain loathsome code</p>
<p>When you witness those committing acts decent people deem abhorred</p>
<p>That gives you leverage over them for which their loyality is assured</p>
<p>And there we have before that central witnessing eye</p>
<p>Power:Loyalty:Depravity in a hell-descending triangular bind</p>
<p>
But if to witness murder earns power over ruthless people</p>
<p>Imagine the additional bond and loyalty from a participant in something utterly unspeakable</p>
<p>And the full extent of terror grips you when you understand</p>
<p>These demons are not solo aberrations, their congregation is central to the plan</p>
<p>
A plan that seeks to expand ‘oh here’s a new billionaire pitching us a business proposal</p>
<p>Wouldn’t it be good if his whole empire were placed at our disposal</p>
<p>Why don’t we invite him to one of our ‘special parties’ full of promised blondes</p>
<p>And foist on him a slightly underage girl and see how he responds?’</p>
<p>
A former FBI head said before he was assassinated</p>
<p>A satanic paedophile cult is growing through the coercion of the implicated</p>
<p>
And since those Wikileaks revelations, no one knows the location of the CEO of the Clinton Foundation</p>
<p>And what of Podesta himself? Since the election defeat, not even a tweet</p>
<p>Unusual for someone at the epicentre of accusations of such heinous deeds.</p>
<p></p>
<p>My friends of the Left, we are in a VERY precarious place</p>
<p>One false move and we will spend the next hundred years in disgrace</p>
<p>For how can I any longer claim to be of the Humanist Left</p>
<p>In aiding and abetting through ignoring what such vast quantities of evidence suggests?</p>
<p>And my poor dear friends in the unwitting gay community, </p>
<p>for whom Clinton is so revered she is part of their sense of identity</p>
<p>I hope you are not too slow to wake up and forcibly distance yourselves from Hillary</p>
<p>Or the backlash will strip you of every righteous gain in your liberties</p>
<p>And I myself expect many of my liberties to be restrained </p>
<p>By a shift to conservative puritanism of the so justifiably outraged</p>
<p>How does the Left get remembered in this, </p>
<p>If we fail to come to our senses and forcibly resist?</p>
<p>Will we be known as those who had our heads so up our ass</p>
<p>That we allowed a horde of demons to saunter on past?</p>
<p>Responding to micro aggressions with macro ones, and seeking safe spaces in universities</p>
<p>Adoring a high priestess who seems up to her neck in such perversities?</p>
<p>Unless of course this despicable cult also includes Trump</p>
<p>In which case you, me, Left and Right and all our children are fucked</p>
<p>
Follow the evidence yourself and the most strident atheist</p>
<p>Begins to wonder if these are not indeed the signs of the return of the Beast</p>
<p>This will usher in a hundred years of the most cloistering conservatism</p>
<p>But if that’s what it takes to destroy this ring then I tender my submission</p>
<p>I don’t mean to berate or persuade you to come to my self-same conclusion</p>
<p>But just check the evidence yourself - not to validate me - but for the love of God and the sake of Children</p>',
