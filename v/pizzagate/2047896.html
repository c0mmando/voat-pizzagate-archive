<p>“I was first taken to the pedophile ring when I was six by a woman who worked as a cleaning lady for my mother.”</p>
<p>“She and her husband took me away for a weekend to babysit me and it was her husband who took me to the pedophile ring.”</p>
<p>“Later on, my mother got involved and then she started to take me herself.”</p>
<p>“My mother was never really a mother. She was a very sick woman and a psychopath.”</p>
<p>It was around her sixth birthday Miss Lucas was taken to an orgy for the first time, in a castle. </p>
<p>She was used for an S&amp;M show, chained up with an iron dog collar and made to eat human feces.</p>
<p>“Afterward, left lying there like a broken object, I felt so humiliated”, she said.</p>
<p>Miss Lucas was sold into the murderous pedophile network in Belgium aged six</p>
<p>Bravely speaking out about her horrifying ordeal on the Global Citizen, she said:</p>
<p>“The adult men that were part of the network were there for various reasons.”</p>
<p>“There was a lot of alcohol and a lot of drugs.”</p>
<p>“The children were a commodity, the highest and more valued commodity, and used for sex.”</p>
<p>“No child deserves what I went through, or what millions of children go through.”</p>
<p>Children were scared into silence and members of the network killed those who threatened to go to the police. </p>
<p>”I had to do it [the rapes] because there was always the threat of being killed.”</p>
<p>“Children were killed. Boys were more often tortured but girls were killed.”</p>
<p>“I was graphically threatened…it was not something that was talked about.”</p>
<p>“The killings were not always private and I remember I once saw a body.”</p>
<p>She added: “The children were set against each other.”</p>
<p>“There were friendships but I tried to keep things as simple as possible to survive.”</p>
<p>“I really didn’t want to be made a “favorite” of one of the network because I knew what happened to girls who got singled out… It created a lot of problems. I tried not to stand out.”</p>',

             That's okay. These stories need some recirculation. Sometimes they need rewrite and to be refocused in terms of information that will help people understand the seriousness of the issue.
