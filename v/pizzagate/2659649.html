            <p>
             THEY WERE BEING TAKEN TO AN ORPHANAGE.
            </p>
            <p>
             The children were being moved from Haiti to the DR.

            </p>
            <p>
             There is more to the story, though, and they weren't connected with just one orphanage.
            </p>
            <p>
             Additionally, by the same degree of separation, Clinton and Alefantis also are a connection to Silsby. So are a few others.
            </p>
            <p>
             Being connected to Alefantis through Maccoby, Clinton and Heather (or was it Arwen? or both?, puts Silsby a lot more connected to "pizzagate" than nearly any other person.

              The first part of this is false and the second part is irrelevant. Silsby had this dream of setting up an orphanage in the Dominican Republic, but that is completely irrelevant to where she got them from. I don't assume they were being taking from an orphanage, I know that.  The AP found exactly where the children came from and spoke to the parents who gave them up.  The Haitian courts spoke to them as well.  In a lot of cases children in Haitian orphanages have parents, just parents who can't care for them.   13 of the children came from an informal slum orphanage in Citron and 20 came from an orphanage in Callabas associated with the Protestant Haiti Sharing Jesus Ministry.  Neither place was where the Catholic NPH operated.  She was taken to these place by an American pastor named Jean Sainvil.

               If you know the facts, then you know WHICH orphnage they were going to, yes? Clinton Donor Micheal Zaleskis orphanage in Cabarete, the Dream Center.
              </p>
              <p>
               Or was there another orphanage in Cabarete?
              </p>
              <p>
               I'm genuinely curious if you know because the flaw in your stance is that you are claiming to know which orphanages were involved.
              </p>
              <p>
               The only new orphanage in Cabarete at the time is tied to the Clintons. Funded by the likes of Spencer Kimball and Zaleski, along with other Clinton donors.
              </p>
              <p>
               So... I get you are saying there's no ties, but I don't really see that as being the case.
              </p>
              <p>
               Where were the children taken from, where were they going?
              </p>
              <p>
               WHY WOULD THE FAKE LAWYER lie about which other orphanages were involved?
              </p>
              <p>
               Also, are you aware about the orphans being flown in military planes with a governor per Valerie Jarrets authority?
              </p>
              <p>
               Something to think about... but I contest there are ties from Silsby to Clinton via the orphanage the children were being delivered to.

                No, they were not going to an orphanage in Cabarete at all. Silsby was trying to start her own orphanage from scratch and had leased a technical school/retreat center that had once been the Costa Liza Hotel for 6 months to serve as a temporary space while she got her permanent thing going.   Silsby's original plan was to start her own orphanage and had bought land in the hamlet of Yagua Magante section of the town of Gaspar Hernandez, Espaillat province which is 30 minutes away. This is from their mission statement.

                 Bishop Julio Cesar Cornielle told the AP on Friday that the church agreed to rent a building they owned to show solidarity with Haiti. The missionaries invested about $3,000 to make the building safer for children, but the deal fell through after they were detained, the bishop said.

                I have no idea where you got your ideas about the Dream Center, but it is not an orphanage.  It was not new in 2010 and it was well funded and professional.  Not only is there zero evidence Silsby was involved with them, there's no conceivable reason, they would need to hook up with some bumbling, clueless amateurs from Idaho.

                The fake lawyer was lying about lots of things during that time.  Why is this lie more signicant than his other lies?  My guess, since he doesn't speak French Creole, was he googled some stuff in English to try to find something plausible that would make Silsby seem sympathetic.  Again, Puello was lying.   NPH/NPFS do not use the name Friends of the Orphans in Haiti and their orphanage did not collapse.  It was fully functional.  If they needed to move children, they would have used their orphanage which was not where the earthquake hit

                That had nothing to do with Silsby.  The majority of them were in the process of being adopted by US parents, but 12 were not. The US women caring for them refused to leave without these 12. The women were from Pennsylvania which is how Ed Rendell got involved.  The email traffic at the State Department and the White House was about getting permission for these 12 to leave Haiti as the others were cleared.   Here's the back story to that.

             Max Maccoby represented Alefantis and Brock in a case where they were being blackmailed. Funny that the files don't detail what they were being blackmailed over, of course.

              This part is where the whole thing breaks down

              <p>
               This is the very same orphanage that 33 children were taken from in 2005 in the Laura Silsby case.
              </p>
             </blockquote>
             <p>
              This is absolutely not where Silsby got the children from.  She got them from two towns where NPH doesn't operate.  And NPH is not Friends of the Orphans, they are two legally distinct organizations.  NPH actually runs orphanages including in Haiti.  Friends of the Orphans does not.  It's a fundraising organization based in the US.
             </p>
             <p>
              We know exactly where Silsby got her kids from.  The AP traced where every one of the 33 children came from.  The Haitian courts talked to this folks as well.  Read this article.

             <blockquote>
              <p>
               This was revealed by Jorge Puello, Laura Silsby’s lawyer in the case.
              </p>
             </blockquote>
             <p>
              Actually, this was
              <em>
               claimed
              </em>
              by Jorge Puello who was not a lawyer at all, but a conman.  In fact to make this claim that Maccoby is connected to Silsby, you have to ignore the mountain of evidence against this claim AND you have to take the word of a conman. I'll quote my previous posts to show why it's highly dubious that Puello had any information at all.
             </p>
             <blockquote>
              <p>

             </blockquote>
             <p>
              Also absolutely completely false.  In fact, this isn't even't what pizzagate alleges.  The Allegation was that Hillary Clinton and the State Department were personally close to the Silsby's group not the Clinton Foundation.  The allegation is based a false claim that Hillary Clinton was aware of Laura Silsby's group since 2001.  This claim is false.  The State Department emails make it quite clear that no one at the State Department knew Silsby or her group before they were arrested.
             </p>
             <p>
              I debunked this as well.

             <p>
              Here's the core of the problem with Jorge Puello.  He made this claim on Greta Van Susteren's show.
             </p>
             <blockquote>
              <p>
               VAN SUSTEREN: Where did they find these 33 children? How did they get these children? PUELLO: There was an orphanage that collapsed in Haiti. It was called friends of the orphans of Haiti. And there was somebody over there that told them that the orphans had no place, no room to place them.
              </p>
             </blockquote>
             <p>
              So here's the issues with this.
             </p>
             <p>
              A. Puello is the only source of this. If Puello is telling the truth, we would be able to find evidence of an orphanage called Friends of the Orphans that collapsed.
             </p>
             <p>
              B. There is no orphanage called Friends of the Orphans in Haiti. It's a US based organization that raises money for NPH the organization that runs orphanages around the world including in Haiti.
             </p>
             <p>
              C.  NPH is Spanish for Our Little Brothers, in French Creole speaking Haiti, it goes by a Nos Petits Frères et Sœurs or NPFS.
             </p>
             <p>
              D.  NPFS did not have an orphanage collapse in Haiti like Puello claims.  Their orphanage was in Kenscoff which was not hit by the earthquake.
             </p>
             <p>
              E. Puello is not exactly a reliable source. We know he is a liar and a con man and anything he says needs to be backed up from other sources.
             </p>
             <p>
              F. In fact, in this case, we known specifically he is not telling the truth here.  Because we know the answer to the question: Where did the children come from? The AP severely undermines Puello's claim because they tracked where Silsby got everyone of the 33 children.  None came from an NPH facility or a town where NPH operated.
             </p>
             <p>
              G. NPH/NPFS does not give up children for adoption.  Their model is to educate children so they can become independent members of their own community.
             </p>
             <p>
              Remember Puello was lying to the press throughout this whole incident.  Puello was not a lawyer.  He presented himself as a lawyer to families of the Baptists in Idaho, some of who hired him.  But since he was not a lawyer, there was a Haitian lawyer on the ground who was their actually lawyer, Edwin Coq.    Here's a quote from an American lawyer for 4 of the Baptists
             </p>
             <blockquote>
              <p>
               “My clients have never met Mr. Puello and know nothing about him,” said Caleb Stegall, the district attorney of Jefferson County, Kansas, who is representing Drew Culberth, Paul Thompson, Silas Thompson and Steve McMullin. “As far as my clients are concerned, Mr. Puello never spoke on their behalf and as far as I am concerned, Mr. Puello has no involvement in this case now on behalf of my clients.
Hiram Sasser, who is representing Jim Allen, said his client never authorized Mr. Puello to represent him, either.
              </p>
