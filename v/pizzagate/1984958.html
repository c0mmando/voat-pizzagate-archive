<p>As stated above, this is a follow-up to my post on Petworth, but things have changed. That whacko wonderland of Satanists and cannibals known as California is now proposing legislation that would turn the state into one big ‘Get Out of Jail Free” card for potential human traffickers. Yup, why not make it easier for them to prostitute kids? But, of course, the nutso legislation that has been criticized by law enforcement has been shielded under the noble principle of resisting Donald Trump’s immigration policies. Translation: They don’t want any kind of sane restraints that would restrict the flow of spice and pizza across the borders. But I digress, let me start at the beginning with MS-13. </p>
<p>The Mara Salvatrucha originated in El Salvador, and its history is unbelievable. The sad truth is that it was homegrown terrorism, built from the ground up through the disastrous, failed immigration policies. And this all took root in Pelosi’s backyard: California.  Since this gang is all about human trafficking, they have taken over locations like LA, Washington, DC, and NYC. MS-13 is at the heart of pizzagate. Recently, there was an arrest of ten illegal immigrants for the murder of two teenage girls that involved satanism. </p>

<p>But was this fostering intentionally done? Evidence points to it being purposeful. Why do I say this? Well, because way back in 2006, NBC ran an article calling them one of the biggest threats to national security and yet nothing was changed. </p>
<p><a href="http://www.nbcnews.com/id/11240718/ns/msnbc-rita_cosby_specials/t/ms--one-nations-most-dangerous-gangs/">http://www.nbcnews.com/id/11240718/ns/msnbc-rita_cosby_specials/t/ms--one-nations-most-dangerous-gangs/</a>

<blockquote>
<p>[This gang has committed one of the most] horrific crime scenes ever witnessed by law enforcement, young men, women and children brutally murdered with machetes. These innocent victims were slaughtered and dismembered for no reason at the hand of MS-13. 
La Mara Salvatrucha, more commonly known as the MS-13, are considered by the FBI to be the most dangerous gang in the U.S., leaving their mark from El Salvador to Honduras to Guatemala to New Mexico, and now on U.S. soil.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But how did they get on U.S. soil? Let’s explore:

<blockquote>
<p>Sanz and Martinez paint an unfamiliar picture of the Mara Salvatrucha in its early days: that of a small group being victimized by other, larger criminal players. In addition to building a reputation as a dangerous foe, the Mara had to find allies in more powerful gangs, gangs like the Mexican Mafia.</p>
<p>So there you have it. The MS-13 was pretty much nothing when it arrived here. And the article pretty much inadvertently destroys Obama/Snowflakes narrative about Mexicans by calling out THE MEXICAN MAFIA. Really? Those humble workers from the south who never ever ever do anything wrong have a criminal element? You mean, Trump was right and got hammered because he spoke the truth? Further: </p>
<p>But no, MS-13 was not born of Barrio 18. The number 13 is actually a name that indicates homage to a criminal force majeure, the Lords, the Mexican Mafia, which reigns in Southern California. The Mara Salvatrucha would take several years to build that friendship and that number.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What? FRIENDSHIP? So they aligned with the MEXICAN MAFIA? Oh, this cannot be! Only friendly, meek neighbors to the south seek refuge in the country with no walls and no president who cared about preserving the country he swore an oath to! And the headline for this post references “Goat Hill” Pelosi being a proud momma to the crisis. How? By blithering like a loon and “not politicizing” the countless thousands of teenage kids streaming across the borders that apparently occurred to a 2008 law (it’s referenced in the YouTube video I’m posting below. First the stats: </p>

<blockquote>
<p>In 2013 &quot;91% of illegal immigrant \'children\' apprehended at the border were teenagers,&quot; and &quot;of the nearly 60,000 illegal immigrant \'children\' who were apprehended since October of last year, 84% have been teenagers&quot; according to Pew research as reported by Breitbart.  Moreover, &quot;males between 15-17 years of age comprise 47 percent of all unaccompanied minors&quot; according to Homeland Security as reported by Breitbart.
So basically it\'s a bunch of older teen boys swarming the southwest border, and no demographic group terrifies law enforcement more than adolescent testosterone. ... crime forensic psychologist N.G. Berrill said &quot;the most dangerous person on the planet is a teenage boy&quot; \'&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And where’s the deranged Pelosi on this? Well, you can read her statement on the issue in the article, or hear it for yourself: </p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ffG7jxrGtyM">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ffG7jxrGtyM</a> </p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;I reference the conference of bishops statement in which they say baby Jesus was a refugee from violence. Let us not turn away these children and send them back into a burning building.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It’s hard to believe that someone is that stupid, and I don’t think she is. It leaves a more Machiavellian perspective to ponder. I wonder … I wonder … I wonder if she was an active participant in letting this group blossom. I mean, they’d be so useful to The Pedophile Elite plans, no? </p>
<p>Here’s another article on the thugs Ms. Pelosi likens to Baby Jesus: </p>

<blockquote>
<p>MS-13 was declared a transnational criminal organization (TCO) by the U.S. Treasury Department in October 2012. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>In 2012? And two years later, fucking Pelosi is still referring to them as Baby Jesus? More:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It is the only Latin American street gang to have achieved the TCO designation by the Treasury Department. Los Zetas is also a TCO, however, they are a paramilitary cartel rather than a street gang.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yes, there it is!!! THEY ARE A PARAMILITARY CARTEL!!! Now you see how useful they could be in activities like human/organ trafficking. Quite a group to nurture and have on your side, no? And this article is pointing to them now disguising themselves and fitting in by not tattooing their faces. Without the identifying marking, they could slip over the unprotected border quite nicely. </p>
<p>And in 2016, surely there must have been something done … nope! Here are the stats: </p>
<p><a href="http://www.washingtonexaminer.com/ms-13-surging-with-influx-of-youths-crossing-border-92-arrested-illegal/article/2606467">http://www.washingtonexaminer.com/ms-13-surging-with-influx-of-youths-crossing-border-92-arrested-illegal/article/2606467</a>
<a href="http://archive.is/sQ75F">http://archive.is/sQ75F</a> </p>
<blockquote>
<p>— 92 percent of MS-13 gang members arrested are in the United States illegally.
— 80 percent of the tens of thousands of Latin American youths who\'ve crossed illegally into the United States and were seized by authorities have subsequently been placed with other illegals, some with ties to the gang.
— In calls to track the so-called &quot;unaccompanied alien children&quot; placed with adults in the U.S. illegally, contact has been made with only 56 percent.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But what of this 2008 law that was referred to in the YouTube video? Well, I looked it up and it was passed by Slick Willie’s friend, George WTF Bush! Yup, and you know what it was supposed to do? AID IN STOPPING CHILDREN HUMAN TRAFFICKING. Are we all getting this now? </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Now the legislation, enacted quietly during the transition to the Obama administration, is at the root of the potentially calamitous flow of unaccompanied minors to the nation’s southern border. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>And here’s the LA Times reporting in 2017 on what was known about in 2006!!!! </p>
<p><a href="http://archive.is/twJ3M">http://archive.is/twJ3M</a> </p>
<p>The alarm was sounded and nothing. OUR government created its own ISIS right here to break apart America. MS-13 could not only be controlled by the pedophile elite, but they could be used to human traffic, abduct, create videos/snuff films, and even be used as mercenaries to rid the elite of enemies if need be. We’re always wondering who does the dirty old grunt work, and look no further than here.  
</p>
<p>Which brings me to the current Sanctuary State legislation. </p>

<p>What’s the catalyst? Well, in a way it is Trump: </p>
<p><a href="https://www.boston.com/news/politics/2017/04/19/trump-top-officials-take-aim-at-brutal-ms-13-street-gang">https://www.boston.com/news/politics/2017/04/19/trump-top-officials-take-aim-at-brutal-ms-13-street-gang</a></p>
<p>Trump, top officials take aim at brutal MS-13 street gang</p>
<p>Yes, this is the news we’re not getting. Trump and his staff have the MS-13 on their radar. Further, they’re making border crossings more complicated by policing and restricting flow. If there is a human trafficking cartel, you see where this is going to put a crimp in sending cargo out and receiving it. Hence the absolute need for an open border, and California works perfectly! They’re already using it for that purpose: </p>

            It is the only Latin American street gang to have achieved the TCO designation by the Treasury Department. Los Zetas is also a TCO, however, they are a paramilitary cartel rather than a street gang.

           Yes, there it is!!! THEY ARE A PARAMILITARY CARTEL!!! Now you see how useful they could be in activities like human/organ trafficking. Quite a group to nurture and have on your side, no? And this article is pointing to them now disguising themselves and fitting in by not tattooing their faces. Without the identifying marking, they could slip over the unprotected border quite nicely.

            — 92 percent of MS-13 gang members arrested are in the United States illegally.
— 80 percent of the tens of thousands of Latin American youths who've crossed illegally into the United States and were seized by authorities have subsequently been placed with other illegals, some with ties to the gang.
— In calls to track the so-called "unaccompanied alien children" placed with adults in the U.S. illegally, contact has been made with only 56 percent.

           But what of this 2008 law that was referred to in the YouTube video? Well, I looked it up and it was passed by Slick Willie’s friend, George WTF Bush! Yup, and you know what it was supposed to do? AID IN STOPPING CHILDREN HUMAN TRAFFICKING. Are we all getting this now?

           The alarm was sounded and nothing. OUR government created its own ISIS right here to break apart America. MS-13 could not only be controlled by the pedophile elite, but they could be used to human traffic, abduct, create videos/snuff films, and even be used as mercenaries to rid the elite of enemies if need be. We’re always wondering who does the dirty old grunt work, and look no further than here.

           Which brings me to the current Sanctuary State legislation.

          </p>
          <p>
           Yes, this is the news we’re not getting. Trump and his staff have the MS-13 on their radar. Further, they’re making border crossings more complicated by policing and restricting flow. If there is a human trafficking cartel, you see where this is going to put a crimp in sending cargo out and receiving it. Hence the absolute need for an open border, and California works perfectly! They’re already using it for that purpose:

            Elites  have  always  used  various  gangs, I'm still  looking at  the  story but  you  painting Trump as some  great liberator is  foolish-he is a con man who  says what  people want to  hear while at  the same  time putting the  worst  mega-criminals  in  his cabinet, kissing Israeli ass sending $38,000,000,000 of taxpayer money  while  Americans are losing their  homes and  can't  afford health  insurance,  new story  about Trump bending over to  the Saudis who  practice  chattel  slavery and  pedophilia, has apparently blocked 9/11 investigations of the Saudis, ad infinitum...

             You're entitled to your opinion. He's the real deal. The fact he's working his ass off to put this country on the right course and you're calling him names just shows why it's amazing he's doing anything at all. He's the first president in a long time to take this job seriously and be honored to be president and in the White House.

            MS-13 is my go-to explanation when trying to explain to people why we need an extremely tight border. I mean, other than the fact that U.S. and Mexican elites are working together to actually HELP the cartels get drugs and humans across the border, we also have shit like this to deal with, these insane street gangs that are becoming more violent by the day. And now they're throwing Satanism (or brujaria, whatever you wanna call it) into their business practices? Fuck me. Someone GAS THESE ANIMALS ALREADY.

            No amount of sob stories will change my mind on this. I do not want the southern United States to become a place where you MUST be armed at all times or else you may be subject to a brutal machete murder and possibly even get sacrificed. That is the future of Texas, Arizona, and New Mexico if something doesn't change soon.

             I fear you're right. It's ridiculous for the authorities to be looking the other way. I'm so glad Trump is clamping down and targeting these gangs. But whose behind the gangs? That's also a problem. It means Trump #dainingtheswamp.

              Trump swims in the swamp. If you don't think he's getting down with 13 year old Ukrainian prostitutes, you're incorrect. He may not be full-on into the Satanic shit, but if you think Trump is not a member of a Masonic Lodge at the very least, you're kidding yourself. He is not a Catholic (not that being one is anything to be proud of).

               I don't. It was said the beginning of his presidency, that his lack of membership and vows to a secret society means he doesn't owe anything to anyone. That's why he's so feared -- because he's not controllable.

                I have yet to see any evidence of any swamp being drained. If Trump is gonna do something, he'd turn in Epstein. But he won't, because Epstein has dirt on him during his time at Orgy Island.
               </p>
               <p>
                In case you didn't know that, Trump was PROVEN to be on the flight logs for Epstein's "Lolita Express" jet. Trump has been to Epstein's Pedo Island. And what do you think he did there? He fucked underage sex slaves.

                 Trump went ONE TIME to Epstien's Island. In a brownstone operations, they don't tell you on the Lear jet they are going to blackmail you.  You're making very broad conclusions on the available information.

                 Trump threw Epstein out of Mar-a-Lago. Epstein wanted to get something on Trump.

             Actually, I believe I read they did receive training, but don't know if that's what caused them to form the group. I think the article I read implied it made them more sophisticated. I'd have to find that article again, but good point.

            The other angle on this is that having brutal criminals in the streets justifies the militarization of the police forces across america. When you read about brutal slayings, you can't also protest that the cops are basically storm troopers and given tanks and assault gear. .

              Italy -- I distinctly remember how just walking into a bank required going through a security vault door that I have still never seen here in the states. And the teams of military police stomping around with assault rifles though city streets. This was in the 80s.

            great research. Yes, MS13 is a bunch of completely psychopathic degenerates and sadly no amount of rehabilitation will ever help the ones responsible for the sick things they do to torture and kill innocent people. Evil to the very core. They are virtually everywhere, all the way up to Canada selling drugs and human trafficking. When Trump speaks about Mexicans and building the wall I strongly believe the MS13 are whom he is referring to. I wonder what Obama would think of one of his false daughters getting hooked up with one of these losers and pulled into prostitution? Or Clintons granddaughter being stolen and sold off. These asswipes never think about anything happening to their own they just don't care about the regular everyday people, the people who really run the world, US.

             Exactly. It's okay if it happens to one of the minions, but if you create a gif, you're public enemy number one. Priorities backward and they allowed this situation to happen. Trump is taking decisive action and the Pedophile Elite are shitting bricks. I hate that Trump isn't being given credit for taking this one. Everyone should be singing this man's praises.

            Good write up, but I don't think I agree with the title. MS started in LA in the 80's and grew to a massavie gang under Clinton &amp; Bush. Not saying that Obama didn't help them, but to claim they were homegrown by Obama isn't the whole story.

             You are clueless. Obama's laws targetting "Unaccompanied Alien Children", helped the spread of MS-13 around America.. everyone knows this, except leftie libtards, who still refuse to admit Obumma destroyed what was left of America after Dubya Bush

             Unfortunately, The Jewsih-neoliberalists-Democratic Party-Obumma-Hellary 's plans of destroying what is left of White America and turning the US into another socialist third world hellhole got derailed when Trump got elected.. this is why the Jewish media (CNN. Jew York times, WaPo, etc) hate him so much.

              Clueless? I never once said that the tranny lover didn't help MS13. What I did say is that they weren't solely homegrown by Obama. A 2008 FBI threat assessment put the size of MS-13 between 6,000 and 10,000 members in the US, making it one of the largest criminal enterprises in the country.

               There is a big difference between useful idiot Bush, and evil, liar, neolilberalist scum Obumma.
              </p>
              <p>
               MS-13 goes way back.. it was indirectly created thanks to Reagan's contra dealings and creation of the wars in Nicaragua and El Salvador.
These wars displaced millions of low-IQ central Americans, who ended up in the US as "refugees". This is basically the same story we see today with Syria and Europe..
              </p>
              <p>
               These low IQ central americans and their illegal children created MS-13, when they joined the gangs in California, and were eventually expelled back to El Salvador.... they created MS-13 there and exported it back to the US.
              </p>
              <p>
               Obumma had 8 years fo end MS-13 in the US, but not only he did nothing, he helped legalize a lot of its members with its libtard "Unaccompanied Alien Children"...  so please stop trying to put the blame elsewhere...

               Apparently you didn't even read the article
              </p>
              <blockquote>
               <p>
                The flow of so-called Unaccompanied Alien Children (UACs) is so obviously the cause of the gang’s revival that the Post’s reporters have to acknowledge it up front: “MS-13’s new push has been fueled by the recent influx of teenage immigrants like Danny, who traveled to the United States without guardians to escape poverty and gang violence only to fall back into it here.”
               </p>
              </blockquote>
              <p>
               Do some research, There have been two movies made about children from Central American traveling through Mexico to come to the US using the trains.

               I have seen both of them.. in these films, you can see the harsh reality these kids create and try to escape from.
              </p>
              <p>
               MS-13 is using this flow of children to send in their MS-13 members to the US, using Obumma's laws.
              </p>
              <p>
               Only a moron libtard like Obumma and its ilk, would think that kids that are already used to raping, torturing, killing and stealing are going to come to the US and magically become good citizens.. without any parents overseeing them.. typical insane, socialist libtard logic.

                   As i explained already, MS-13 are not homegrown under Obumma, nor under Bush... Reagan planted the seeds for MS-13 with the wars the US financed in El Salvador and in Nicaragua. So you are wrong Jew buddy.

                  I just want to clear things up here, we're obviously having a miscommunication. I completly agree with you that Obama made things worse. My only point is he didn't start it and it was already a huge problem when he got into office.

                   We are having a miscommunication. The video of Pelosi highlights the administration's position on this. If anyone thinks that Pelosi is not going to repeat the party narrative and do as told, well, they've got to be out of their minds. Look at the idiocy she's spouting. And the point is that they could have been crushed. When they first arrived in CA, they were the least in terms of numbers. So what happened to propel them up the ranks? Why are they in Petworth? That's what this post is ... a follow-up to someone saying that the MS-13 s running brothels there. Obama and the rest of his goddamn party have made things infinitely worse by doing nothing to top the flow of "Baby Jesuses" across the border. If I'm understanding you, if a president takes office, and he inherits a problem, it's not really his fault? Yes, it is his fault for not doing anything. If you don't agree with that, then you don't. But I ain't changing my mind. There were clearly things that he could have done, and instead, he did nothing but whine about PC correctness, apologize for the U.S.,, and allow the flow of these gang members across our borders.

                    No.. Not at all saying that. He should have dealt with it, instead he continued the globalist policy and made it worse. I have no problem with the content of your post, it was the title I disagreed with because it makes Obama sound solely responsible and that's easy to dismiss.

              Oh because immigration to CA is about ensuring theres never another Republican elected there.  Jews from Finland to Australia push for immigration as a DIVIDE AND CONQUER TACTIC not to harvest ever-more organs!

              Open a FUCKING history book and youll see Jewish organizations have been the biggest promoters of immigration/amnesty. But you dont want to accept that because youre VAIN and it seems to simplistic, youd rather waste your time postulating a mercenary group of assassins.

            MS13 has their own bastardized version of Santa Ria and idol worship.  It's a perfect fit for the pedosatanists.

           <p>
            If you look at the missing kids lists, they are almost always 95% latino and black kids.  MS13 harvests them, trafficks them, sells them to the elite.  I'm sure they would have no issues with organ traffiking either.  And hit jobs.

             Those two guys that were gangland slain in SC the day after Seth Rich, the police believed they were MS-13.  I believe they were also SEIU Members (one of them was formerly with LIUNA and SEIU took them into the fold) and thus may have been asked to do the hit job on Seth.  I am not saying this is gospel, but I think there is a possibility.

              Get a dumbass or two to do the hit - that may be why the hit was botched (primary theory), then get rid of the dumbasses the next day.  If it is a "gangland" stylle hit or murder in suburbia, versus inner city, it probably has to do with the aforementioned dirty work and link to the pedoelites.

              And don't be surprised if the Deep/Pedo State puts them up to attempt a big hit on someone/something.  I don't know what, but it's coming.

               For a couple bucks you can get a crack addict do do about anything. Popping someone off, making it look like an accident, probably no big deal. I think about all these cars on the sidewalk... on the other hand, there are legitimately angry people out there and I've kind of got to the point where is someone is killed, they probably deserved it.

                I agree to a point.  The problem is that it has crept into suburbia and kids are randomly taking pills and dropping dead.  The amount of junkies on the streets of big cities is astounding - San Francisco, Baltimore, Asheville, Seattle, Portland, etc.  I know Boston has a big problem two as do most of the major NE cities.

                It's sickening to watch this happen.  If by design, is it for organ harvesting?  Maybe the synthetics have some very short half life and doesn't affect organ viability.

                 so many of these addicts are young, their organs are probably way better than some 70 year old alcoholics. Im not a medical expert but I wouldn't think that the opioids would affect the organs as much as cocaine or alcohol. Not the lungs heart, eyes, bones, etc. When you add the fentanyl you're basically causing the lungs to stop breathing.

                  That's my take on it at as well from my limited medical knowledge. It's such a trace amount required for LD50 or LD25 or whatever they are going for.  Don't want to kill off all of your customers at once.  Wouldn't that be a mess?

                   I wonder if there is someone actually doing logistics for this, monitoring hospital demand for organs vs drug shipments to the neighboring towns. Pretty fucking grim. If there is fewer organs needed, they can have the cops do a "traffic stop" and intercept the kilos of heroin.

                    It's not even heroin.  Is fentanyl, carfentanyl and other synthetic derivatives suspended in malitol or some inert ingredient and pressed into pills.  Stupid kids take them thinking God knows what it's going to do and bam - overdose.  The dosages for this stuff is measured in micrograms.  Agents have been overdosed by accidental handling of the stuff.  Yet they make pills in an apartment.  It's 100% terrorism.

                     as habit I kind of simplify them in my mind as updated versions of the traditional junkie, but this shit is indeed a new creature.  And as you point out, it can only be being made to be used a death agent.

                      There is no rational reason for it to be on the streets, other than pure, soulless greed or as a weapon. That other nasty crap like krokodil, bath salts, etc. makes you batshit crazy.  If you get a good dose of this you get pharmaceutical grade narcotic high.  If you get a teensy bit too much, you're dead unless EMS is on scene within 5 minutes with a generous does of narcam (sp).  That stuff is getting hard to get.  You'd think it would be made in huge quantities for everyone everywhere.

                       narcon, they are actually handing it out to family members of "junkies" in RI, &amp; the police carry it. I don't think you even need a prescription. From what I've heard you have to tie the person down first because once they get the narcon, they fly up all adrenalined and punching, and head right out for another fix. (this may not be true).

                        Knocks the opiates off the receptors immediately so they can start breathing again, may take a bit to go back into w/drawal. But if it's heroin or fentanyl, won't take long.

               You are right, I feel too that something is in the offing.  I don't know what either.  Many have said the hit on a journalist or announcer, either a false flag, or the getting ride of someone that has become a liability.  John Podesta?

                Just based on the uptick of "human trafficking arrests" as reported by several newsfeeds I'm on, i'd say the volume of arrests has tripled in recent weeks.  I know, not scientific.  But sometimes, paying attention to the signs works.

                 I believe it too.  I read and then it all starts piling up in my brain and then Bingo.  Yes, it has escalated and that is Good.

               This is all I can find right now.  I had not seen this before, What I saw before was a news article in where the police were saying they were with the MS-13.  There are quite a few articles and I have gone through a lot of them.  Rafael Aguilar and Carmelo Calixto are the 2 gang members and Aguilar had been arrested before on domestic battery.  Carmelo's nickname?  Maldito.  Not good.

               This may take a while.  I have written this before.  Around the time all the Anon stuff came out about Seth Rich.  We were also researching the SEIU, etc.  I will try, and then get back to you.  It was in an article from the town they were shot in. Myrtle Beach?

                yes it was myrtle beach, they were found dead in and near a gold van. I'm sure there are threads in the Seth Rich subverse. It was all over 4chan too

               Yes, they are a necessary Evil for the Elite because they know we will revolt.  These are the people we will have to fight and the Para-Militarized Police Forces  they have created.  We must fight these Sanctuary Cities for they are fighting to live.

                Every war, especially internally(recent history), there are outside interests that weasel into position, the power vacuum.  Those listed above you have purposely made this Country weak and it is such another waste of bloodshed.  Hopefully its avoided but if not let it be over quickly.  I still am hoping all the blips of legal actions like Susan Rice to testify on political spying/unmasking, and the pure panic they are in, they never wanted this type of image blasted publicly and their own kind warned them against repeating the same narrative, breaks people out of the coma.

                CNN is now a joke, they lied about Russia, must mean the other side was right about what they have been accusing the whole time.

                The Clinton's method of always projecting and turning the focus on someone else has been beyond frustrating to learn about, but its all in their backgrounds at their ((LAW SCHOOLS)) where that generation plotted to destroy the Constitution and revert the world back to chaos so they can recreate this continent in their own image.

                 Bill Clinton is so deeply involved in the whole Racine is Corrupt debacle that it will take an army of us to dig into this and  find the evidence.  It is there.

                  For any skeptics, look at these few things alone, let alone the mafia ties to the Clintons which run through Chicago and up into Wisconsin. There is a reason why the Dixie Mafia re-emerged in Wisconsin of all places.

                   Do you think there is any hope for us?  People have been commenting to me that we are surrounded as if it is hopeless.  I do not agree. I think they are nervous and scared because I think so many people are speaking out on twitter. But I do think most people on here are hopeful and determined.

                    It is a race between the Truth and AI. Whoever gets there first wins. The people need to understand that they have the power to change the world until AI controls us all. AI is their new God. It is all knowing, all seeing, all powerful.

                    What they do not want people to know about is Racine, Wisconsin and how it is a main Root to the entire system of Pizzagate and Global Criminal Corruption.

                   <p>
                    If the world knew about Racine, and the real agenda to control and enslave the world, there would be great hope for real change. We have a plan, we just need the global spotlight on Racine.

             Exactly. These guys wouldn't think twice about organ harvesting. In fact, it would be an offering to their god and they'd think it fun. An anecedotal story: there was a girl that left the gang and was tracked down. She was killed so brutally that the police actually refused to release the details. I'm trying to find the link for it. It was on the web, but you know how things disappear. When I used to do a search for San Francisco and human trafficking, the stats ranking it only behind Amsterdam used to pop up. Now? Now all the stupid useless sham agencies set up to shield the crimes are at the top of the search.

               But the federales were unprepared for what happened next. In what had become a routine procedure, they showed a photograph of Kilroy to the ranch caretaker and asked if he had seen the missing American. Yes, Kilroy had been there, the caretaker told them, pointing to a corral and a tin and tarpaper shack on a rise about 400 yards away. As the lawmen approached the corral, they were engulfed by the sickening stench of decaying flesh. Buried in several shallow graves in the immediate area were the remains of twelve males, including the mutilated body of Mark Kilroy. Some of the victims had been slashed with knives, others shot. At least one had been burned, another hanged. Many had been savagely disfigured, their hearts ripped out, their ears, eyes and testicles removed. One had been decapitated. Eventually three more bodies would be found in the area, bringing the count of corpses to fifteen.

              This stuff is real, this is from the Mark Kilroy case. It gets worse. This was in the '80s. Below is the connection to the voodoo crap they believed in. Santeria. These were drug lords.

               Experts identified the objects found in the killing shack and in Aldrete's room as accouterments of Santeria, an underground Caribbean religion in which African gods are identified with Roman Catholic saints, and of Palo Mayombe, a darker mix of voodoo and African gods with origins in the Congo.

               The Kilroy murder is connected to Henry Lee Lucas and GW Bush.  That's why Bush, as "The Death Penalty Governor" of Texas, made the unusual move of commuting HLL's death sentence.

                Wow that's so sad. Kilroy was same age as that kid. Obama ... the fast and furious gun-running can be added. Also, CIA is supposedly behind these gangs, using them as in Operation Gladio, to terrorize.

             I think you are going to see CA go through a very serious social crack when things get going in a few more months.  Everyone in DC is getting their vacations in now.  Shit is gonna hit the fan after labor day.

             MS-13 is extremely real and extremely violent.

             They also happen to be hard core occultist and often Satanic.

             It's no wonder that the Pedophile Democrats would cozy up to MS-13.

              And now it's Trump's problem and he's taking it on. Amazing that I didn't see one headline about Trump going after these guys.

                 Drudge has been covering things happening with MS-13. Pretty sure I read something about Trump staying on top of developments with this gang on whatdoesitmean.com.  Voaters (some)make fun of that website, but, they are right about things, sometimes....especially  about gangs and  all things Vatican. Just my humble opinion, though.
