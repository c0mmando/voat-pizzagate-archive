            You're just swimming in a pool of confirmation bias.  Why do the words pasta and cheese trigger your spidey sense?  Let's face it.  You want to believe all this.
           </p>
           <p>
            You just know Beanie Babies must really shady, sinister even.  You are telling yourself a story.   Confirmation bias is something we are all prone to, it a cognitive shortcut  our brain takes some times.

            Breitbart was known to be in poor health, they are video where they are doing a rememberance of him with close friends and one says they never suspected any foul play because Breitbart had a heart attack not too long before his death and his doctor told him to calm down and relax more and he didn't do it.
           </p>
           <p>
            Breitbart's tweets from years ago have zero to do with pizzagate.  They have to do with James O'Keefe's stunt video.
           </p>
           <p>
            Go ahead give that  Marina Abramovic documentary a try.   Look up pasta with walnut sauce.  Try to find a source for the "FBI pedo code" prior to to 2016.

            Boy o' boy that has rattled my cage! The hubris of this guy is off the scale and this can only mean that he KNOWS he's untouchable within the framework of power where he resides.

            As already stated here, most people just don't have the faculties to research and process something as monumental as Pizzagate let alone the time and motivation. This is the greatest hurdle for our community and the reason why the Establishment is winning. They can convince the sheep far more easily than us as they have decades of generational brain washing in the bank. Just put it in the MSM that something is antithetical to a dissident idea and the vast majority of people will drink it up and defend it as if it were a religion. And that's what the media has done to people, turned them into disciples.
           </p>
           <p>
            I'll admit that I'm getting impatient and increasingly demoralised and angry but I believe we may have passed the peak with this investigation and will continue to plateau for a while before we start to shrink as a community and become a fringe band.
           </p>
           <p>
            We have to be honest with ourselves and it may take a couple of slaps round the face for this to set in but it's indisputable. The first fact is Trump has now well and truly shown his hand and it's that of a Zionist agent (not buying this 8D chess BS, it's gimmicky!) He and the entire US Gov will not bring this down as they are IT and there is no other cadre on the planet that can threaten the Judeo Masonic Cabal. They own and run the majority of Global Establishment security and can not be beaten.
           </p>
           <p>
            The other fact is, in light of the first we have no other option than to take the law into our own hands. The majority of us on here probably already appreciate this or would at least acquiesce to the idea. So what to do? I don't have the answer currently as it's beyond my life experience and knowledge to even fathom how it could be done but I am sure that it's our only option and I relate it also to the broad issue of our increasing global oppression under what one day will be a World Communist State.
           </p>
           <p>
            We can't defeat them conventionally and we can't love them into submission so it's guerilla warfare tactics and it doesn't get nastier than that. Time is now absolutely critical as we won't be stronger than we are now. Thoughts on what to do next?

            Podesta sympathizer? Me? DarkMath? Holy fuck, you didn't go look through my comments. That's ok:
           </p>
           <p>
            Norther_Soul had you done a little research you'd discover I hate John Podesta with the heat of a 1000 Suns. My intense desire to see John Podesta finally meet up with the justice he so richly deserves is probably the only reason I'm here.
           </p>
           <p>
            I have a constant argument going on in my head about whether George H.W. Bush or John Podesta is that Anti-Christ.

            My evidence is that Pizzagate started at 4chan /pol/ and Reddit's TheDonald.  These are not neutral, uninterested sources.
            <br/>
            (Also FBIanon is fake.)
           </p>
           <p>
            There are NO FBI code words.  That is fake.  And someone has deceived you about that.
           </p>
           <p>
            "Cheese Pizza" was used on 4chan and other places as code for child porn.  There are zero references to "Cheese Pizza" in the Podesta emails.  Chicken is an old time slangword.  The rest are completely made up.  The is no "FBI code words."  You've been hoodwinked, I'm sorry to say.  Try and trace that list of code words back to the FBI.  Then google pasta with walnut sauce and see if this could have been an innocent mistake.

            The joy is in reading the responses.  What an idiot is Podesta.  I can imagine he's hard at work with his lucifer buddies doing all kinds of incantations and rituals for protection from investigators.

           <p>
            You do understand that pizzagate stemmed from dedicated political enemies of John Podesta and Hillary Clinton trying to smear them and pretending Podesta was speaking in code and then faking evidence to support this deception, right?  The pedo code is made up and fake.  For example, what does pasta with walnut sauce mean to you?
If you actually were ready to give him the benefit of the doubt, you can easily do that with hearing from him.

            I'll take a shot at what that would look like.

             Ambramovic is well known and well respected performance artist, known for deliberately provocative art.   Some people like her stuff, some hate it. There's no real middle ground with her.   My brother is into really into her stuff and was a patron of an art institute she was starting.  The Spirit Cooking in the email was just a dinner she was making for patrons.  The highlight of the dinner was a Tibetan Golden Ball.   It's sort of a meditative practice, where you peel almonds and count out a certain number of seeds and then mix it together, I think with chocolate and then it's covered it gold leaf and you eat it.

             Spirit Cooking is also a work she did twenty years ago.  People have twisted the metaphors in that work to.  There was a performance part and an actual recipe book. The recipes are basically absurdist poems. Are you familiar with absurdist art?  It's not meant to be taken literally.  Some of the recipes you have to make on earthquake nights, some call for eating pain.  Her "anti high blood pressure" recipe calls holding a phython on your lap while sitting on a block of ice."  One of the recipes calls for eating her fingertips.  This has never happened, because it's not literal.  Trust me, she has all ten of her fingertips.

             I didn't say dominoes on pasta my friend did, but that's exactly what it means.  We often play dominoes with our friends and I changed up my Christmas gifts one year.  I used to give pasta and sauces as a gift and this year I gave cheese.  It just means playing with a belly full of pasta or cheese.  You know it's funny, they thought me talking about food so much meant it must be code.  I think to myself, have these people never meant an Italian?   We are all obsessed with food.  I'm a pretty serious cook and you can find some of my recipes online.   This scandal was this close to be called risottogate, you know, as my risotto recipe is now pretty famous."

            Would any of that genuinely change your mind?  Because if you are open to it, you can go through Podesta's non cherry picked emails and see if he's talking in code. If want to see what Marina Abramovic is about you can spend two hours and watch that movie.  Given Podesta the benefit of the doubt doesn't require him giving an explanation.  You can already do that.  Just put aside the idea promoted by his enemies that he is speaking in code.   Are his emails scary now?  Because they are not.

            Pre-Miranda Silence

            WASHINGTON (AP) — The Supreme Court says prosecutors can use a person's silence against them if it comes before he's told of his right to remain silent.
LAW OFFICER TACTICS:  The Right to Remain Silent (The When &amp; How of Miranda Rights)
The 5-4 ruling comes in the case of Genovevo Salinas, who was convicted of a 1992 murder. During police questioning, and before he was arrested or read his Miranda rights, Salinas answered some questions but did not answer when asked if a shotgun he had access to would match up with the murder weapon.
Prosecutors in Texas used his silence on that question in convicting him of murder, saying it helped demonstrate his guilt. Salinas appealed, saying his Fifth Amendment rights to stay silent should have kept lawyers from using his silence against him in court. Texas courts disagreed, saying pre-Miranda silence is not protected by the Constitution.
The high court upheld that decision.

            Someone needs to post on Twitter about the Satanic Calendar.  It is customary to give body parts from an infant male as gifts on Christmas Eve.  That is the date of that email regarding playing dominos on pasta or cheese.  This is the longstanding tradition referred to.

            I think it might be because if you have convinced yourself there's anything wrong with the spirit cooking, which was a normal dinner at that point that he didn't even attend, the handkerchief and dominoes emails, what exactly could he do to convince you he's not guilty?  Is there anything he can do to convince you he is not a sick fuck?    Be honest.  Is there anything he could do change your mind?   Because if there isn't, why should he bother himself with your accusations?
           </p>
           <p>
            Is the the skippy video the worldcorp video?   Because now you're dragging in stuff that isn't even related to him, stuff he had nothing to do with.

            Entirely fair. I dunno, though. Maybe other people are right and he's on standby to replace Comey. It's my understanding that Chaffetz once tried to get into the Secret Service, so clearly he's got some kind of interest in a more hands on form of public service. Couldn't find any other indicators of this on his Wikipedia, but it's clear that the shills at 'the free encyclopedia' wanted to put a negative spin on everything this guy does.

            Could also just be that a decade in Congress is enough for him.

             He did try to get into secret service but did not happen. The only reason that is known is because "someone" went in his file illegally during Bengazi questioning on HRC. The secret service or their handlers leaked personal &amp; tried to smear him as a threat for him to stop going after HRC for her e-mail &amp; bengazi tradegy

            Chaffetz was originally going to try to run for Orrin Hatch's seat after the Tea Party encouraged him to. He made a better deal w the swamp at that time that he could run in 2018 when Hatch retires and also get important appointments to committees if he played ball. So he took the deal and fucked over the Tea Party. Tea Party and Trump never forget. Trump tells Hatch to not retire next year. Chaffetz then says he isn't running for anything. My guess is that the swamp has leverage on Chaffetz and Podesta the Molesta Skippy knows what it is.

            I am for sure shadow banned on Podesta's twitter.  My tweets appear to be there from my account but they never get replies or likes, so I looked from another account and they're not there.  Podesta hates that I always link his emails and his brother's art collection.

             Good for you. I had nightmares from that sick shit those degenerates call art. That series with abused kids in a bathroom were horrifying, and the Kim Noble ones were like a glimpse of hell.

            I can't take this -  Two Of Trey Gowdy's Investigators Are Missing -  I hope they are found safely, now there are multiple reports of this and it does not sound promising!  :'0 too many anti-Clinton/Podesta/Soros people ending up dead! Praying they are safe. -

              Don't bother. I posted it today because there were a lot of news sites posting it. I didn't know it was fake news. God forbid. A bunch of haters started being rude as usual. Nobody has the decency here to let someone know nicely. It's easy to be a jerk when their hiding behind their computer screens.

               Hey, I know exactly how you feel, but don't let it get to you. We need to have tough skin here and move on. Just ignore their bullying tactics and be on your way. I assure you, a lot more people than you think are awake and see the shill posts. Don't give up the fight, I stand with you.

              A thread was already started on it (yesterday, I believe).  It was debunked because it is a bullshit story.

             Two men working for the congressional committee headed by Trey Gowdy have mysteriously disappeared somewhere in the Little Rock, Arkansas area. According to phone records, the men were headed into the area with congressional subpoenas to search the private residence attached to the William Jefferson Clinton Presidential Library.
            </p>
            <p>
             The men, whose identities will remain classified until it can be CONFIRMED that foul play was involved, were employees of the federal government under private contract to investigate the Clintons. What they were looking for is also classified. Their vehicle was found in a rest area just outside of town with the keys in it.
            </p>
            <p>
             The Justice Department has assigned special investigators in order to keep the case out of the hands of the FBI, which has obviously been compromised. The Clintons haven’t returned requests for a statement.

             Fifty percent of what people say when they are joking is true. So, by making some sort of joke about it, you get to say what you really want without being vulnerable.. In this case, I sincerely hope you represent the other fifty percent.

                Dude I'm not a shill. Nor is my comment of any significance regarding John Podesta. The problem is you don't really believe these people will be brought down. That's why you don't want to show ANY mercy whatsoever.
               </p>
               <p>
                I disagree. Not only will these people be brought down sooner than later, many of them are going to hang by the neck until dead for their crimes. You're not picking up on their desperation for some reason.

            He is commenting because he has TS access. They are throwing this in everyone face. Remember not just Trump was spied on everyone has been. Obama admin &amp; HRC even went into Senators files during investigation. Democratic senators as well. Fienstein was asking for Brennan resignation. Obama said no

             Feinstein asked for Brennan's resignation over the release of the CIA torture report.    Nothing in Podesta's comment requires Top Secret access.  It's practically a cliche that when a politician all of sudden wants to spent time with his family, either they were just turned down for a job they wanted or a big scandal on them is about to break.

             The Trump was spied on/unmasking story fell completely apart today.  Most the transcripts Rice asked about did not involve Russia and were not related to Trump before the unmasking.

            <blockquote>
             <p>
              several members and staffers on the House Intelligence Committee,...visited the National Security Agency, ...and were shown a binder of two to three dozen pages of highly classified intercepts...
              <em>
               These intercepts were not related to the heart of the committee’s Russia investigation. In fact, only one of the documents had anything to do with Russia
              </em>
              according to an official who reviewed them.
             </p>
             <p>
              What the intercepts all had in common is that the people being spied on made references to Donald Trump or to Trump officials.
              <em>
               That wasn’t even clear, though, from reading the transcripts.
              </em>
             </p>
             <p>
              I spoke to two intelligence sources, one who read the entire binder of intercepts and one who was briefed on their contents.
              <em>
               “There’s absolutely nothing there,” one source said. The Trump names remain masked in the documents, and Rice would not have been able to know in all cases that she was asking the N.S.A. to unmask the names of Trump officials.

             I agree. This is Deep State playing their cards on spying on these guys.  This is how the game was played for years. Blackmail at its best. Chaffitz is probably a Mormon and they found him playing a "Jack Mormon." Maybe something so serious he could be thrown out of the Church.  I hope not because he and Gowdy are keeping these assholes in a panic mode.  Chaffitz told Hillary at the Inauguration he is still taking her down.

            Jason Chaffetz has been outspoken critic of Hillary Clinton for a long time.
           </p>
           <p>
            I have a bad vibe about this Podesta's tweet in which he implies that there might be other reasons for Chaffetz not running again in 2018 than just family reasons. This is quite passive aggressive message and Podesta is not used to tweeting that much.

             It's not passive agressive. It's direct.  When a politician suddenly makes a surprise announcement, it's often because some bad story is about to come out on them.
            </p>
            <p>
             There have been rumors that Chaffetz is involved somehow in the Trump Russia thing.   They started a week ago on Twitter.  If that is the case, your bad vibe is justified.
            </p>
            <p>
             The more benign rumor is that he knows his committee is going to be asked to look at Trump and he didn't want to do that with the same gusto he went after Clinton.

               Pizzagate essentially started from the Podesta emails on Wikileaks.

            Chaffetz was forced out by the Deep State.  They probably threatened his family.  Podesta is an evil snake.

             On Trump's inauguration day I was quite surprised, while everyone was leaving, that Chaffetz waited for Hillary to shake her hand. As one of the leading playing tough anti-corruption politicians this has made me very sceptical about Chaffetz.

             Chaffetz is supposedly running for Governor in 2020, probably in a bid to build a portfolio of executive experience and enact more meaningful change. Not seeking reelection in Congress is his way of scaring pedos by saying "I'm onto you, I'm not backing off, and you can't threaten me with my seat." Podesta's tweet doesn't necessarily blow a hole in this theory, because this could be Podesta (a professional mouthpiece) saying the Elite won't blink. They might have something on him, but if they do, they clearly haven't used it yet, or this tweet never would've happened. At least that's my analysis.

               Yeah, I recently heard him say he's probably gonna go into the private sector, so I guess he's at least taking a break. Other people think he might take Coney's job though, and if that's the case, it makes sense that he's making it look like he's retiring. That's the type of move you make as a surprise. They'll probably wait until the foreign affairs nonsense calms down.

               When will the American public awaken to the fact that their government is a farce and launch a second civil war? I mean look at Podesta - in my world he would be investigated based on his appearance alone - it will be in the statutory code - looks creepy, pedo look, see the chart - what pedo scum look like, we're conducting an investigation.

            Pizzagaters' comments under Podesta's tweet are great!
           </p>
           <p>
            Is it possible that Chaffetz is being groomed for another non-elected position, such as FBI director? Such a change would allow him to move his family permanently to DC. His background is strong, but who knows what's cooking?
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jason_Chaffetz">
             https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jason_Chaffetz
            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            Podesta might suspect that Chaffetz is preparing himself for a position that doesn't require maintaining two households, and what this could mean for elite pedophiles -- Chaffetz could go after them from a new position of power.
           </p>
           <p>
            Also, is it possible that Chaffetz' reference to the importance of family has something to do with his being "Brownstoned?" Or his refusal to be?

             Probably not FBI Director, since Comey is under contract for several more years... unless he is forced out somehow. I hope Cheffetz wasn't threatened into not running, he is one of the good ones.

              I agree that Jason is one of the good guys, and my hope (unsaid in my comment) is that Comey can be forced out! That might take awhile because he will soon be the star of a new TV series to boost his image:

             I Wanted to mention that as well, the commenter Jason Wong is in full defense of pedosta and his innocent emails. Repeatedly saying if there no body here is no crime. What a crock of shit. Glad he was countered effectively by the truth seekers.

              go check out his info. He works with Nancy Pelosi I believe, or at least in the white house. He is a dirty shill. Likely they had him as a child as well, another mind controlled shill soldier. He's got dirt guaranteed.
