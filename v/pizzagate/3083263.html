<p>&quot;What’s been disclosed so far has been very little about the Jewish immigrant from Russia and Poland who worked as cable splicer, Joel Smollett Sr., the father of 4 sons and 2 daughters, all of them child actors and later producers or musicians. All the Smollet children were featured in the cast of the sit-com “On Our Own” ( A 1994 Sit-Com that\'s premise was an older sibling cross-dressing as a female to save his siblings from child protective services).

<p>Pizza Brazilian-style</p>
<p>Now let’s lower all those gooey strings of cheese down onto a bed of crust and red sauce for this latest addition to our Pizzagate menu spiced up with peppery Satanic hot sauce from Brazil. The comedienne Mo’nique, who starred as the abusive mother in “Precious” has seen her career evaporate due to her refusal to surrender one of her children for a child sacrifice by the black voodoo ring that rules the hip hop scene. She’s complained of being blackballed by Oprah Winfrey, Lee Daniels and cross-dresser Tyler Perry, and has publicly stated that she is slated to be murdered by the Hollywood cabal. Remember Tupac Shakur, folks, cause the killing’s just beginning.</p>
<p>What has this voodoo cult scandal have to do with Jussie Smollet? For starters, at age 19 he landed his first major role in “The Skinny”, a film about 4 gay male students and one lesbian at Brown University on a weekend in New York City, which was directed by the extremely disturbed black gay director named Patrik Ian-Polk. The Mississippi-born indie director later released “Black Bird” starring Mo’Nique and co-produced by British-Caribbean gay talent Rikki Beadle-Blair, who was awarded an MBE by the Queen (that stands for Member of the Order of the British Empire)</p>
<p>What could Mo’Nique and other frightened talents be so fearful of? Human sacrifice, usually children, to certain gods of the voodoo pantheon, for example, Kalfu the god of darkness and conspiracy who is the equivalent of Satan or the powerful death goddess Brigitte, who cannot be appeased with a decapitated chicken or stuck pig but demands a more powerful sacrifice. Perverse forms of the old African folk magic are flourishing across the tropical Americas, and merging with the Luciferian beliefs of the Illuminati, as the puritanical ethics of the European Christianity collapse under the secularism of the Jewish commercial class and its crass materialistic values. Following that shining example from the late Roman Empire set by the Bishop of Carthage and Hippo Augustine, those among us who intend to prevent the collapse of Western civilization now face the same challenge of standing down the occult belief systems or another Dark Age will surely engulf the world.</p>
<p>Now that the heat on the cheese, sausages and herbs is starting to puddle into a pizza, it’s time to toss on the chile peppers. The oldest Smollett sibling Jussie was born in Santa Rosa, Rio Grande do Sul, which is the heartland of Brazil’s blood sacrifice cult known as Oro, or by anthropologists “Candomble”, which has a sharper edge than Louisiana Voodoo. The southernmost region of Brazil, which is closer to Buenos Aires and Montevideo, Uruguay, than to Rio or Sao Paolo, was ruled by the Jesuit order until national independence. That region was one of the secret routes for the postwar “rat lines” for SS officers and their Jewish collaborators on medical experiments in the labor camps, leaving a legacy of organ harvesting and child abductions that continues to this very minute. </p>
<p>So what about the whereabouts of Papa Joel Smollett en route from Eastern Europe through Latin America on his journey to Southern California, as indicated by the June 1983 birth date of Jussie, born in Brazil and later issued a birth certificate in Santa Rosa, California, another fake American like Barack Obama. Called The King by his brood, there is no trace on record of Joel’s mystery years, when the Russian Mafia was emerging out of a collapsing Soviet Union in inextricable economic crisis, at the same time that organ trafficking and the child-sex trade were growing like wild vines in the Brazilian jungles.</p>

<p>Recently, we have been witness to a bevy of threaded investigations here at <strong>VOAT PIZZAGATE</strong> that connect all of the same names in this conspiracy and this one is no different. Within the revelations we have come across considering the old, and the new trafficking routes along the <strong>Caribbean Sea</strong>, the celebrities that own personal islands there like <strong>Oprah, Johnny Depp, <a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/2370750">David Copperfield,</a> Tim McGraw and Kenny Chesney</strong>, the controversies that surround **CDAN, David Geffen and Glee producer Ryan Murphy, Marc Salling and the HAITIAN child porn<em><em>, and all of the controversies surrounding <strong>Jeffrey Epstein</strong> and those personalities like <a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/3072826">Kit Laybourne</a> (</em>and his connections to</em> <strong>Oprah</strong>), are we really that surprised to see an actual <strong>MKULTRA manufactured INDUSTRY family IN-ACTION?</strong></p>
<p>Of course not. <a href="https://outrageousminds.wordpress.com/2013/12/12/photos-support-claims-that-george-h-scherff-jr-was-the-41st-u-s-president/">Now that you know</a>. </p>
<p>For what it\'s worth Q did say they turned some of them into stars. I do believe that him and his family are certainly one of those cases.</p>
<p>By orchestrating this staged attack, <strong>Smollett</strong> was aiming for police protection for himself and the children of his siblings against the demands of voodoo cultists for child-sacrifice victims, as has already been experienced by one of his co-stars, the comedienne Mo’Nique (who has had <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7gIzQ-BOBk">similar run-ins</a> with the same particular group of people) <strong>AND</strong> <strong><em>attempting to create the tension that might appease his masters.</em></strong> </p>
<p>The name of the game is multiple angles and goals with lots of chaos and confusion the connections don\'t end there...</p>',

           For what it's worth Q did say they turned some of them into stars. I do believe that him and his family are certainly one of those cases.

           By orchestrating this staged attack,
           <strong>
            Smollett
           </strong>
           was aiming for police protection for himself and the children of his siblings against the demands of voodoo cultists for child-sacrifice victims, as has already been experienced by one of his co-stars, the comedienne Mo’Nique (who has had
           <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7gIzQ-BOBk">

           with the same particular group of people)
           <strong>
            AND
           </strong>
           <strong>
            <em>
             attempting to create the tension that might appease his masters.

            The New Orleans Jewish Community Center where Maxine Perry worked was only blocks from Tulane University, Dr. Heath and Dr. Greene. They were all uptown on St. Charles Street. Perry recalls that he had to see a doctor every Tuesday for allergy shots. I can only speculate that he was being seen at
            <strong>
             Tulane
            </strong>
            , and it wasn’t for allergies.

           <p>
            Jake’s father, who was white, was Ashkenazi Jewish (from a family from Romania, Russia, and Poland). The family surname was Smolovitz several generations back.
           </p>
           <p>
            Jake’s paternal grandfather was Peter Smollett (the son of David Lewis Smolovitz/Smollett and Dawley/Dawlly Levy). Peter was born in New York. David was a Romanian Jewish emigrant, born in Iași, Iași County, the son of Jacob Smolovitz/Smilowitz/Smollett and Rebecca Moscowitz. Dawley was born in New York, to Polish Jewish parents, Charles D. Levy and Esty/Betsy Cohen.
           </p>
           <p>
            Jake’s paternal grandmother is Molly/Mollie Hirschenson (the son of Irving I. Hirschenson and Gertrude Horowitz). Molly was born in New York. Irving was the son of Jeremiah Hirschenson and Sarah Heller. Gertrude was the daughter of Louis Horowitz and Anna Lupin.
           </p>
           <p>
            Jake’s maternal grandparents were John Harris and Grace/Raphel Smith.

            My family is from Elmhurst, Queens, 54th Avenue, but I was born in Northern California. It's really funny, you know, [my bio] says 'Brazil' making me feel really exotic and cultured, but actually, I was born in Santa Rosa, California. I'm from Sonoma County, and they're saying 'Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil.
           </p>
           <p>
            Smollett initially began his acting career as a child, co-starring in the films ‘The Mighty Ducks’ and Rob Reiner’s ‘North’
           </p>
           <p>
            ( I have seen the movie North on his bio, but didnt realize it's a Rob Reiner movie)
           </p>
           <p>
            Jussie Smollett was initially in a relationship with American Actress Raven Symoné. The pair dated from 2007 to 2011.
           </p>
           <p>
            In the early months of 2016, he was reported to be going out with director Anthony Hemingway.
           </p>
           <p>
            Smollett came out as gay in 2015. At present, there are records that he is in a relationship with Tawan Davis, a real estate businessman.
           </p>
           <p>
            <a href="https://marriedbiography.com/jussie-smollett-biography/">

            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            a 2018 AP interview, Smollett recalled shooting The Mighty Ducks in freezing-cold Minnesota, "the one thing that sticks in my mind specifically is I remember going to Prince's nightclub that he had, and performing there when I was 9 years old." The Purple One wasn't in residence at the time, alas, but not a bad memory from his first feature film.
           </p>
           <p>
            And then honestly I remember over the last years how, whenever Mighty Ducks would show on the television," he said, "I knew that...six weeks later I was about to get a $400 check, my residuals. And I'd be calling up SAG with my broke [self] being like, 'Uh, run that check, run that check.' Those are the days when I had $17 in my account and I had to find $3 to deposit, so I could take a $20 out."
           </p>
           <p>
            (  the early 1990s, Pudlitzke booked musical acts for Glam Slam, a Warehouse District club owned by Prince. During the four years he acted as booker, he brought in B.B. King, Miles Davis, Average White Band, Morris Day &amp; The Time, Creed, Soul Asylum, and The Whalers. Prince also played there when he was preparing for a tour or just felt like it.
           </p>
           <p>
            Why would he book a kid thats 9yrs old?  would have to find link, but it was a group act, there were younger ones.
           </p>
           <p>
            odd that the manager died 2 months after Prince, both overdoses, the dude never married either

            Has anyone on Voat reported on or had knowledge of the "Podesta Pizzerias" in Buenos Aires, Argentina btw? There are two of them and I was shocked when I saw them while I was in Buenos Aires.
           </p>
           <p>
            My name is Brandon Henry and I was born into a Satanic cult unknowingly. Search my name on Voat to read a previous post.

            I always knew my grandpa molested me, but it wasn't until I was older and began researching the Illuminati that I remembered he was a freemason, for instance. I always knew my grandma was really weird and into nature, but I never knew why she had beds of crystals in her yard and hung an upside-down star up at christmastime.
           </p>
           <p>
            These are just two small examples. Anyway, I am currently fighting for my life and am in need to get my story out on as many outlets as possible. If you have any ideas on this feel free to email me at

             No, thank you Brandon for having the courage and strength to bring awareness to what you have been through. So there are "Podesta Pizzarias in your city huh? Ok, yes, I did a voat search and see that you did create a thread on that and got a few answers that might help. It does seem like it would be odd that J Podesta would own two pizzarias in Brazil but.... but... we have seen that Alefantis has modeled his pizza shop in DC after DR. Pong and has since at least TRIED other locations. You never know what kind of other grooming facilities these assholes might have dreamed up. I'm glad you have contributed. I am sorry that you have come to the realization that you believe you are an mk victim, if you feel the need to talk or need any help feel free to message me.

             The VC is a site I have viewed before. They do a great job in exposing the Illuminati. I looked at the links but didn't see any mention of a black voodoo ring. To me it is showing more young people selling out to the Illuminati and Satanism for fame. Perhaps the ring that was mentioned in OP post is just another segment in the Illuminati.

            This is a great post. This is the first time I have heard of a black voodoo ring ruling the hip hop scene. I would have thought it was black mafia controlled. From what I read it does sound like the Smolletts were a MKU family.

            That is really shocking about Mo'Nique. Sexually assaulted by her own brother for 4-5 years. She said she was being blackballed by Oprah, Perry and director Daniels. It is true she hasn't worked for a while. Pray for her and her families safety.

All the Smollet children were featured in the cast of the sit-com “On Our Own” ( A 1994 Sit-Com that's premise was an older sibling cross-dressing as a female to save his siblings from child protective services). Smollett Sr. died from cancer at age 58 on the night that “Empire” premiered on Fox, 5 January 2015, as if by strange destiny.

            I ran into a couple interesting tidbits and discussions that implied that "On Our Own" actually PRECEDED both Medea AND Doubtfire, fueling the debate as to whether or not this pilot episode of this show was the inspiration for Tyler Perry's multimillion dollar empire of crossdressing films...
           </p>
           <p>
            Well you know what, it might have been the inspiration for Tyler Perry we'll never know but somehow I doubt it because the show was actually a PRODUCTION of a subsidiary of Warner-brothers that bought out an old studio called Miller-Boyett the  production company that mainly developed television sitcoms from the 1970s through the 1990s that was responsible for family-oriented hit series such as
            <strong>
             Bosom Buddies
            </strong>
            , Happy Days, Full House, Perfect Strangers, Mork &amp; Mindy, Laverne &amp; Shirley, Family Matters and Step by Step.
           </p>
           <p>
            There you go,

            Another point that I wanted to make about Yoichi's article is that he points out that Jussie's legal team is a list of some very high powered names also connected to many of the operations the Clintons needed lawyers for their entire lives, suggesting that there is an official sanction somewhere for this incident.
           </p>
           <p>
            There are just too many data points to cover about some of the interesting nuances Yoichi Shimatsu points out in his essay, very intriguing and thought provoking.

            Interesting to note, that EX BLACK PANTHER Prince Ray of MindControlledBlackAssassins came to some of the very same conclusion about this episode...
           </p>
           <p>
            but what is particularly interesting is that somewhere in this video he states the HE BELIEVES JUSSIE WAS ONE OF THE STABLE BOYS IN BRYAN SINGER AND MARC-COLLINS RECTOR. I can't seem to narrow down the point he says it in there and I cannot find any proof of it but that certainly would be a gem find.
