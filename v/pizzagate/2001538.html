            Ever since the day after Scalia passed away I suspected
he was pedo person.
           </p>
           <p>
            Then I got what I thought
was some confirmation of this.
           </p>
           <p>
            Shortly after Scalia's  death I heard Wayne Madsen 
interviewed.
           </p>
           <p>
            The only thing, I  guess, he thought he
could say is this:
           </p>
           <p>
            'Justice Scalia is the only man  I know of that  does
not spend Valentine's Day with his wife except 
for  Dennis Hastert.  Hastert does not either.'
           </p>

            in this post we are becoming aware that in our country we have exactly what our forefathers tried to escape.  We are embroiled in and have been taken over by a mix of Church and State.  Only this is not in our country, it has spread globally.  The Vatican has taken control of the world.  Biden and Boehner  welcomed the Pope's speech to Congress.  This seems to bother no one. The American  People evidently do not realize what this means. They are quiet as church mice.  Thank you for enlightening us again.  Upvoat4U

              This also:After the American Revolution, independent U.S. Grand Lodges formed themselves within each state. Some thought was briefly given to organising an overarching "Grand Lodge of the United States," with George Washington (who was a member of a Virginian lodge) as the first Grand Master, but the idea was short-lived. The various state Grand Lodges did not wish to diminish their own authority by agreeing to such a body.[54]

              Boy I wish I could answer that one.  When I first saw how the Washington Mall was designed like a Pentagram I almost bolted straight up.  That has stayed with me.  I have wondered whether the story about Church and State being the reason they left England is really true.  I wonder if the plan all along was to create a fictitious type of country.  Where we all thought we  had the Land of the Free and the Home of the Brave, when in fact it was a sham from the very beginning.   Don't know if that is true, but we have had Freemasons since the very beginning, Sooooo,,,,,,,,Just a Thought.
