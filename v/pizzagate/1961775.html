            Northern Virginia FBI brunch is part of DC FBI, and not part of Virginia FBI office. While Virginia and Maryland FBI offices make efforts to combat child trafficking, nothing is happening in DC FBI office, including Northern Virginia field office. Few too many employees and contractors of the three letter agencies and other government officials could be arrested in such operations, so nothing is expected to take place in those two areas. The usual excuse that the DC FBI office and it's Northern Virginia field office are too busy with antiterrorism operations, and conveniently there're not funds for such "mundane" things like missing children, local government and judicial corruption, the real estate fraud, and so on. It doesn't matter that it's glaring into everyones' faces as million dollar bus stops on Columbia Pike in Arlington.

             You are incorrect.  FBI HQ is in DC and has little to nothing to do with the Washington field office.  FBI HQ: 935 Penn Ave. Washington Field office is located at: 601 4th Street NW, Washington, DC 20535.  I've known enough folks in both to know that often they never cross paths.
            </p>
            <p>
             The Washington field office covers: Counties and Cities Covered: Alexandria, Arlington, Fairfax, Falls Church, Fauquier, Leesburg, Loudon, Manassas, Prince Wiliam, Quantico, Vienna, and Warrenton.  This also includes the Navy Yard and Washington, DC.
            </p>
            <p>
             The Norfolk field office covers the Tidewater area.
            </p>
            <p>
             The Richmond field office covers the rest of VA.
            </p>
            <p>
             The Baltimore field office covers: Counties Covered: Baltimore (including Baltimore City), and Howard. The satellite offices cover most of the rest of MD.

              Nice, thank you for clearing it up! It explains a lot. How convenient the employees of DC FBI and DC FBI field office in Northern Virginia never cross paths, only report to the same higher ups. Perhaps lack of coordination is part of the problem in DC area? What about coordination with VA and MD FBI offices, never heard of each other? Meanwhile child traffickers do seem to coordinate with each other in all three states and beyond exceptionally well. What a great set up. Few surprises the FBI Baltimore office raided  "massage parlors", clubs, and escort services were many of the sex workers are underage girls:

              </a>
              , and 16 are recently arrested in operation targeting underage human trafficking in Richmond, Henrico, Chesterfield:

              , and arrested a Director of Social Services (!) of Isle of Wight, Va. on child porn charges

              ,  but the FBI DC Field office in Northern Virginia is too busy to back up the local police officers afraid to raid even massage parlors on Clarendon for nearly a decade?

              What would be your insights on that? It's not like the problem is not known, so it leads to only one explanation for the rest of us, the presence of Pentagon, and such in Northern Virginia, not to mention "too rich and powerful" DC clientele.

               My guess is that it is considered a local LE issue.  Arlington, like Alexandria, and Fairfax have very solid police departments with excellent reputations.  I'm sure there are some "bad eggs" in the bunch, but I've never known anyone in local LEO who would even remotely give me pause for thought.
              </p>
              <p>
               That being said, I've been surprised and wrong many times over.

              <p>
               As far as missing children with no picture?  Suspicious beyond suspicious.  What parent of a child wouldn't have at least a couple photos on their Obamaphone?  The missing ones were probably already in the foster/CPS program where photos, etc. are easily lost.

                Local LE issue with largest players HQs in the area who depend on real estate favors from the local real estate cartel that elects own politicians and judges, who in turn use local police departments as private armies.  Some of the higher integrity areas, indeed

                The current pictures in Virginia foster care, for example, are not lost, simply do not exist. Once a child is placed with a foster family, what pictures? Welcome to the human trafficking central, Virginia statistics of missing children per capita is the highest in the country

                 You totally lost me.  What the hell does any of your last post have to do with local LE being involved?
                </p>
                <p>
                 Having said that, I would think that the pedo disease has probably metastasized into about 10% of almost everything.  Local "chapters" have local "customs".  No way of knowing.
                </p>
                <p>
                 None of the aforementioned LE agencies have any reputation for corruption.  In fact, I would say most have pretty high standards of excellence.
                </p>
                <p>
                 But all it takes is for one very generous "booster" to corrupt the right local LEO.  I'm sure the Podesta brothers have the DMV pretty well covered in all the right places.  We just haven't seen it yet.

                  What I'm saying, there are well established schemes of money laundering through real estate, foster care, and such, sex trafficking is only a byproduct of those schemes. Several of them were busted in different states like NJ, FL, CA that even affected Kushner family, but non in DC area. You can ask this civil rights attorney for more specific information, he covers all three states.

                  </a>
                  Child trafficking is only a tip of an iceberg, but if the DC area corruption is drained, the entire country could breeze easier, possibly the rest of the world. DC area is the ultimate bottleneck of corruption, but who would dear to take it on DC Establishment, certainly not the DC FBI with it's NoVa field office. But without addressing the root of the problem, you're not going to resolve child trafficking problem, it's a given.
