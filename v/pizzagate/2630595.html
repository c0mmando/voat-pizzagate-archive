            MattHelm below describes one disgusting tactic employed by defense counsel. The other one was the " no prosecution agreement" . This NPA protected any co-defendants from prosecution, a new concept of law created by co-counsel  Prof. Alan Dershowitz ,  who was not only  a vital witness to the trafficking but who was a recipient  of a massage. At first he denied any interaction with Epstein's girls but eventually he admitted to a single massage in which he kept his underwear on. The  NPO is a new legal tactic that will eventually  will be tested in the higher courts. How mainstream media has ignored not only the crimes but legal tactics that so utterly undermine law enforcement  is both incredible and dangerous.

            He only served 13 months, always remember that - when he should have been executed. Short of that, life in prison and have him put into General Population. F**k the "Affluenza" excuse used by Freemason Judges to let rich perps get away with it for fear that they wouldn't be able to handle Prison being around regular felons. He needs to go to Prison and get the Dahmer treatment.

             The fastest way to gain enough CCP to post is to contribute in the Comment section of other people's threads. Asking for upvotes will generally have the opposite effect, since that is a Reddit thing and most Voat goats hate Reddit.

            Could not read it all. Yes, be Forewarned the  PDF is VERY Graphic.  Had to stop.  I thought the girls were like 16 or 17 (which is still unacceptable) but some were as young as 12!!!  And there were rapes not just other abuses.  JE is a SICK Individal and totally Self Absorbed with his Sexual Organ and Self Gratification.  In Other Words  Totally NARCISSISTIC.  A Perfect Description of a PEDOPHILE.

            Donald Trump is the false prophet who made a deal with the devil to push the mark of the beast.
           </p>
           <p>
            Trump makes deals with child rapists and murderers. He is a Freemason. He is a pedophile. He is corrupt. He married a prostitute. He builds casinos that prey on the poor. He praises known corrupt criminals. He is compromised. He is a traitor. He is a FAKE.
           </p>
           <p>
            Jesus Christ hates Donald Trump.
           </p>
           <p>
            How is anyone expecting Trump to drain the swamp when he is close, personal friends with so many swamp creatures, has only appointed more swamp creatures, and clearly has been compromised by the Mossad, the mafia, the Rothschilds, and so many others along his career?
           </p>
           <p>
            We are the Witness. We gave the FBI, DOJ, and Donald Trump actionable evidence of criminal corruption and abuse involving the wealthiest families and most powerful politicians in America.
           </p>
           <p>
            Instead of enforcing the law and indicting those involved, those who knew what happened were targeted, and several were murdered.
           </p>
           <p>
            As everyone saw yesterday, Peter Strzok and the FBI are a terrorist organization engaged in global corruption, criminal activity and abuse.
           </p>
           <p>
            There is no law, and Trump is a luciferian who pretends to be Christian. He is a FAKE FAKE FAKE FAKE FAKE FAKE.

             You are forgetting the Clintons, both bill and Hillary. They are not innocent at all. They have covered up so much crime that they themselves and their friends have committed.  No political party or person is ever a saint.  Especially the Clintons.  They are the worst of the worst.  They are involved in everything bad.

               Why don't you post some evidence to enlighten us all? I still have only heard that Trump hitched a ride in one of Epstien's planes because his was late. Trump knows, and has been photographed with a lot of people. This kabuki theory is really not based on anything solid as far as I can tell. Melania being a prostitute is pretty far fetched too.

                You must be slower than Molasses. Trump is connected to all the controllers. Connected to Rothschild, Rockefeller, CIA and MOSSAD, A Jesuit, Connected to Epstein, Roy Cohn, Clintons, lies about 9/11, friends with 9/11 criminal Larry Silverstein, Pal of 9/11 traitor Rudy Giuliani, Potus of USA inc owned by the international banking cartel led by Rothschild. You have all been given mountains of evidence about what he is, you chose to ignore all of it. You still think elections are real and the controllers roll the dice on election day? You think anybody on the ballot isn't theirs? Pull your head out of your sheeple ass.

                 Not really at all. I was skeptical the first time I saw him in debates and he dropped out. Ron Paul was gaining more support because he knew what to say, and was not reading off a teleprompter. There are mountains of evidence that Trump is very familiar with all kinds of powerful people in social events good or bad. Still on the fence because I have always been deep into politics. That is all. Is that you Mueller? I want that 17+ million back.

               Ok, so in regards to the Clintons being the worst, how do you figure that they are not the worst? They have amassed over $400million in wealth and they worked for public service their whole lives, they run known child sex trafficking rings, they have a foundation that is a front for money laundering and child trafficking and sex slaves and is used to funnel money into the Clintons pockets from the sale of uranium to the Russians( another country with a child sex slave issue as well). Hillary’s first case as a lawyer was to defend a child molester. They have killed over 50 Americans even in their own party. Bill has raped his way through the halls of Arkansas and DC and the whitehouse and continues to do so. Hillary lied and attacked the women bill raped to save his political career in the media, ruining his victims lives even further, hell she had John Podesta as her campaign manager. That speaks volumes as to the type of person she is.This is just to name a few of the thousands of crimes they committed against women children men and America. 
I never said any other political family was good, but this family, by far is the worst.  You just want to hear yourself talk and pick a fight.

                They are employees of the banking cartel. They are scum. The bushes are CIA. Funded Nazis in ww2. Mudered Kennedy, cause chaos world wide and brainwash US citizens. What's the difference? They are all vile, needing of being burnt at the stake. You seem to not know what is going on or how it works. Bush family is CIA, they are not corrupt, they are the ones the corrupt people like the Clintons. Again, what have you guys been retaining about how things work? Look at all that wasted typing you did. They all are doing evil for Rothschild. They are all pushing agenda 21 and involved in child massacre. You want a pecking order of who is worse? Why?

                 Ps, you ha e proof bush family murded kennedy, it wasn’t the russians using Cuban surrogates? Oh and the bush family funded Nazi’s?? Ha. Laughable bush signed up to fight in WW2 granted he fought in the pacific as fighter pilot against the japs but he could have still been sent to Europe to fly against the Germans. By the way the japs where part of the axis of evil. Headed by the nazis. They where sharing technology tactics and finances with each other during ww2. So get over yourself.  I never said anything about any of the political families not being bad. You just went on the attack against a innocent general comment I made

Jim Jordan is corrupt. Trey Gowdy is corrupt. Every single one of them has been corrupted and compromised. Every single one of them has been hacked and monitored.

                 As a old saying goes, you can tell a politician is lying when they open their mouth.
                 <br/>
                 Yes he is right, but I never said he was not right. I was making the point that the Clintons are the worst. Everywhere they go, everything they touch and everything they have their hands in goes bad or or leads to death or some kind of scandal or fraud or scheme. Yes politicians have the same outcomes I agree with you, but the Clintons have all of them all the time. Every now and again some of the other politicians on both sides make the best choice for us and America. The Clintons never made anyone a priority but themselves. They take and rape America and the people. 
As a man who has traveled to a lot of countries, mainly shit ones, no government is without corruption. People are greedy and power hungry. It’s human nature. Communism is some of the worst. In Russia the rich and powerful got richer and the poor got poorer.  No middle class at all. 
This person was just looking for a fight and try and make themselves to be a smarty pants, I don’t play that shit.

                  That is precisely why they could not let Hillary be President. Too many people know what you know.

                  Hence President Trump - the false prophet.

              We know something about the Clintons that would make everyone traumatized just from hearing the story.
             </p>
             <p>
              It is personal. They know what they did. Trump knows what they did. So does the FBI. It involves torture and murder.
             </p>
             <p>
              The Clintons have never been forgotten, nor has Donald Trump's close personal friendship with the Clintons. They all have Epstein in common, but the commonalities go far beyond that.
             </p>
             <p>
              The Clintons are a mafia family through and through. Hillary's father ran the Chicago mafia after Capone, and they worked closely with the Dixie mafia and other outfits along the way.
             </p>
             <p>
              If the choice is between Donald Trump and the Clintons, everyone should have known that was not a choice at all. In fact, they couldn't let Hillary win or the people might have made a stand against the corruption. Most dems don't mind the corruption as long as they get their share, but some conservatives have a bit more integrity and can't be bought off. They can however be lied to and tricked.
             </p>
             <p>
              The political system is absolutely rigged and corrupt, and both the Green and Libertarian parties were also compromised. Trump is not an outsider, and Bernie is not trustworthy and made a deal to cover up his own family's crimes. Hillary may very well be propped up again only to lose by a wider margin to Trump in order to continue the divide and deception. Every other candidate was corrupt or compromised. The first fake show was between Trump and the Bushes. The second fake show was with the Clintons. The third fake show is with the media and corrupt global leaders as they all work together in the great cover-up.
             </p>
             <p>
              Hillary needs to be running for a political office to make the claim of criminal allegations as political mud-slinging. Trump is compromised and they are using the investigations to cancel each other out and keep the game afoot. It is all a show.
             </p>
             <p>
              Why did Epstein plead the fifth when asked about Bill Clinton and Donald Trump's activities on his plane with underage girls?
             </p>
             <p>
              They have done much worse than rape children. This is all very real. Why do you think we get so many downvotes? Is anyone else here claiming to have a close personal experience with the Clintons involving torture and murder? Is anyone else here claiming to have witnessed Trump making a deal with the devil?

            This is indeed a lawsuit against lawyers and not for the faint of heart.  The complaint begins by summarizing  the undisputed facts of Epsteins abuse and the pyramid scheme by which he procured more and more victims, believed to be in the hundreds but only 40 were identified. The complaint provides graphic details of the abuse. It goes on to describe  the plea bargain and some of the facts  behind the plea bargain. This civil case was voluntarily dismissed by the party  filing it.

            does a nice job of reciting the procedural background of the casefile. But he fails to mention the factual background of Epstein's deplorable crimes  and plea bargain which I think was the reason for the post.

             His lawyers contacted every girl and encouraged told their parents to sue Epstein then as part of the large money payment the girls agreed they would never testify in court about what Epstein did to them. He literally bought his way out of prison without the girls testimony there was no way to convict him. The very rich are very different from us.

            This deposition is by one of the lawyers that Epstein sued.
           </p>
           <p>
            Kind of crazy lawsuit.  This deposition is by a lawyer named Edwards.  He and another guy Rothstein were sued by Epstein.  Edwards was the lawyer for a lot of the civil suits against Epstein by his victims.  Rothstein worked as the same law firm as Edwards, but is now serving 50 years on a Ponzi scheme rap. Epstein claimed Edwards was part of the Ponzi scheme, but two years later he dropped this lawsuit.  Edwards is now pursuing a malicious lawsuit action against Epstein.

            Billionaire sex offender drops suit against Scott Rothstein and one of his partners

           <p>
            Updated Aug 17, 2012
By Jane Musgrave, Palm Beach Post Staff Writer
           </p>
           <p>
            WEST PALM BEACH — 
Billionaire sex offender Jeffrey Epstein has dropped his lawsuit against convicted Fort Lauderdale Ponzi schemer Scott Rothstein and one of the disbarred lawyer’s former associates.
           </p>
           <p>
            Since Rothstein is serving a 50-year sentence for bilking investors out of $1.2 billion, the focus of Epstein’s lawsuit has long been attorney Bradley Edwards. The Fort Lauderdale lawyer, who worked at Rothstein’s now-defunct firm, became Epstein’s nemesis when he filed civil suits on behalf of five women who claimed Epstein sexually exploited them at his Palm Beach mansion when some were as young as 14.
           </p>
           <p>
            While Epstein ultimately settled the suits, along with roughly two dozen more filed by other women, he claimed Edwards trumped up the allegations to perpetuate Rothstein’s fraud.
           </p>
           <p>
            As part of his scheme, Rothstein would falsely tell potential investors that he had reached large settlements in various lawsuits and they could share in the riches. In the 2009 lawsuit, Epstein said Rothstein falsely claimed he had gotten the billionaire financial manager to agree to settle the women’s lawsuits for as much as $200 million.
           </p>
           <p>
            Despite three years of trying, Epstein never produced any evidence to shore up his allegations, said attorney Jack Scarola, who represents Edwards. Epstein dropped the claims against Edwards on Thursday, a day before Scarola was going to ask a judge to throw out the suit.

             The whole Rothstein case sounded like a shakedown to me...not a Ponzi scheme. The lawyers would settle embarrassing sex cases for a structured payout that was really blackmail. Then Melissa Lewis was murdered by a jealous girlfriend's divorced husband. Give me a break! American Greed and Dateline didn't even mention the suicided bodyguard. I don't trust true crime any more. In one account, I read Rothstein was in a witness protection prison. What is  that?

              the pyramid scheme refers to the manner in which he obtained girls, each one of the  victims required  to recruit  2 or 3 more girls then each of those girls having to bring in so many girls, and so forth.  His prison cell consisted of a private cell which he was permitted to.leave 16 hours per day for work related activities so I suspect he continued his sexual  activities. i didnt catch the name of the facility..

               Rothstein didn't run a pyramid scheme. He was independent of Epstein. A client comes to him involved in a sex scandal and is motivated to settle for lots of cash. He was generating real profit on the balance sheet. Epstein and company were too big for the shakedown.....still are. Rothstein is probably incarcerated in the Giselle Maxwell wing of a Tel Aviv prison....unlike the hapless husband of Rothstein's Secretary accused of murder.
