            This is great. Here's a writer at the Atlantic calling the author of this article a liar and a false fact checker that should be fired back in 2012.

            This is disgusting. So they went out of the way to reinforce that she committed suicide without any evidence? These people are low.
           </p>
           <p>
            "The executive director of the Human Trafficking Center at the University of Denver, had employed Petersen until June as a researcher and as his assistant, after which she moved to Haiti. "
           </p>
           <p>
            But nothing to see here! She just got sad apparently. She wasn't investigating anything. They continue to "appeal to emotion" with all of their "not real" accounts.
           </p>
           <p>
            No one was saying they had evidence, just pointing to the fact that her like others who try to investigate trafficking or expose corrupt government child services seem to die of suicide and murder/suicide causes - these are not natural causes of death, so anyone who tries to frame it that way is suspect. There could always be foul play involved because it is not a natural cause.

            Wow, the bathrooms? See how they try to make us sound as crazy as possible?
           </p>
           <p>
            A central part of the conspiracy theory, spread across Facebook, Twitter and other social media, is that Hillary Clinton and her campaign chief were running a child sex-trafficking ring from the restaurant’s bathrooms.

            Another propoganda hit piece by the MSM. I am hoping that people actually dig into this pretty well-researched story themselves to see that the Washington Post is just inventing a lie to block the truth uncovered by the #FAKENEWS people. This is a pretty good summary:

             Important from that link: Correction NOV 28 - a good friend of Monica confirmed to me in private that she was murdered. Authorities in Haiti are still not giving the family any indication of who murdered Monica.
            </p>
            <p>
             She was previously a research intern at the Laboratory to Combat Human Trafficking (LCHT) and also was a Research Fellow and Assistant Director at the Human Trafficking Center (HTC). She also served on the Colorado Human Trafficking Council's Data &amp; Research Task Force.
            </p>
            <p>
             Both LCHT and HTC announced her passing on Facebook:

             Now, in a tragic twist, an off-shoot of pizzagate has conspiracy theorists speculating that Monica Petersen, an activist for sex-worker rights, was killed because she was investigating links between the Clinton Foundation and sex trafficking in Haiti.
            </p>
           </blockquote>
           <p>
            Not speculation. Someone she is reacted to posted that she was in Haiti for exactly this reason.

            Why would they even report about this if its all false and she just committed a suicide? Its just like the Comet Ping Pong articles, it doesnt make sense they would be reporting about these things if they werent true. In my opinion this just confirms that there's something to it and the TPTB are panicking because its getting worldwide attention.

            Domina Ella quoted in this article was indeed a close friend of hers. I spoke to her. The thing is, she told me the suicide rumors are non-sense and that Monica was murdered and the details so gruesome she did not want to share with me.
           </p>
           <p>
            Monica shared on her Facebook privately, but we got to see what she shared because her friend Bella shared them publicly:

              We don't. And now that we know her friends and family are reluctant to consider a grand conspiracy (much like the parents of Seth Rich) - we might never know.
             </p>
             <p>
              But this was posted back in January. Bella had absolutely no incentive to go about fabricating this back then. If this was posted in October - okay, maybe, I can see some logic in that story line. But in January? Who in their right mind would go through all that trouble to make up an entire list of charges and then say a friend of theirs said all that? Presumably Monica was able to see these posts too and would have said something if this was completely fabricated.
             </p>
             <p>
              Also, Bella in all the exchanges various Reddit users had with her - never claimed those posts were not accurate. So there's that!

            We've got to get independent journalism back. Hopefully, the new administration can restore some of the fair and balanced reporting, but this socialist scum is not going down without a fight.

            Wait. The article says she got suicided. I've been reading up on Monica, both because of pizzagate and have been searching for how she died. This is the first I've read about suicide. Has anyone seen the suicide report anywhere else?

            The question now is if this is a lead or a dead end. I have't seen anything that proves to me that she was indeed investigating the Clinton Foundation. She's still on my list but I couldn't find any proof. Please link me to sources.
           </p>
           <p>
            I'm sorry, but this (

            </a>
            ) isn't a reliable source to me. No name, no date, no link - anybody can make something like that up :/
           </p>
           <p>
            Seeing that WaPo jumps on this so fast makes me believe that it was planted. Be careful what you spread as 'confirmed' just because someone tells you so!
           </p>
           <p>
            Edit: For the record: I would LIKE to believe this to be a real lead, I just can't with what I see right now...

             is the most comprehensive I've seen. I agree with the skepticism involving this story, the "proof" is second hand information unless someone can contact Petersen's friend Bella and ask for corroborating proof that she wrote this message to her.

              Bella confirmed the two posts to Domina Ella last week, who went on to blame Bella for recklessly making Monica's posts public like that.

              Hold up...Monica wrote that both coups against President Aristide were orchestrated by Bill Clinton's administration. This is blatantly incorrect.
             </p>
             <p>
              The first coup was in 1991, during George Bush Sr's Presidency. It's widely believed to have been a CIA-backed coup.
             </p>
             <p>
              Aristide was deposed again in 2004, when George W. Bush was President. The US and France are widely believed to have played a part in that one too.
             </p>
             <p>
              So it was Bush Sr. and Bush Jr. who sponsored coups against Aristide, whereas Clinton actually sponsored the reinstatement of Aristide in 1994. Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama appear to have opposed Aristide's return to Haiti in 2010, but popular pressure was too much. Aristide finally came back in 2011 but has been kept under close watch and hasn't re-entered politics.
             </p>
             <p>
              How could Monica Petersen get the history of Haiti so fundamentally wrong? It doesn't add up with her elite post-grad foreign policy education and experience traveling there. To make things weirder, it's now confirmed that she was working as a History/Social sciences teacher at an elite US embassy-linked prep school in Port-Au-Prince before her death...

              What concerned me first was that the visibility icon which is on every post on FB is not visible in this screenshot (the globe for 'Public'), then I saw the 'Seen by 148'. This indicates that this was posted into a group and not on her profile (no visibility icon there by default).
             </p>
             <p>
              AFAIK 'Seen by' is only visible to admins of the group, so an admin has taken the screenshot.

              My youngest has birthday today so I can't continue right now but joining all groups where Bella is a member of:

              and then searching those for the original post would add a lot of credibility!

              Edit: 'Bella' posted this on January 5 (a day after the post in question):

                 Well, that's a mistake they made in their fanaticism to write negatively about pizzagate.
The mediawhores obviously really are not that good and with some pressure and the need to improvise they make more and more mistakes.

            Its crazy the amount of effort these articles go to. 
"FOUR PINOCCHIOS" 
Are you fucking serious? &amp; the whole "Please, quit sharing this nonsense on social media and let her family and friends have some peace."
YOU BULLSHIT PUPPET MEDIA OUTLETS ARE THE REASON WE ARE RATTLING CAGES FOR JUSTICE.
           </p>
           <p>
            This whole thing &amp; how some people are actually buying into the classic 'tinfoil tales' msm version keeps reminding me of a Matrix Quote.
           </p>
           <p>
            "You have to understand. Most people are not ready to be unplugged. And many of them are so inured and so hopelessly dependent on the system that they will fight to protect it."
           </p>
           <p>
            Keep exposing them. Keep finding a hole in every story. We will win this war.

             I understand the pinocchios as rating for their article.
They confirm the FB-post by Bella being authentic. Then they lie and claim the post, which explains the context were out of context.
Four Pinocchios is probably a bit low for that Chutzpah. I'd rate it 5 Pinocchios. ;-)

            You can see how they force themselves to put "false" and "falsely" every other sentence in an attempt to compensate for the lack of substance to back their dismissal of rather compelling evidence against the Clintons.

I should know because I'm (an unqualified joe)" said (another unqualified joe) about the false accusations that have spread among fake-news websites.  The FBI has not immediately commented on the matter, which goes to show how fake it is. NYPD confirmed that they haven't investigated the affair and found it to be entirely false.

             This brings to light how damaging the 1st amendment can be to innocent lives. Is it time to ditch the first amendment?
That's what the residents of the Roses' Elders Home, Washington DC seem to think. "Hillary Clinton should cancel the election that was rigged by the Russian Federation, and throw Donald Trump in jail for treason" said Mrs Smiths, 98, who lives in fear since the election results were announced.

             I am starting to wonder, have seen this a few places now when they keep spouting 'false... conspiracy theory'  'false ... fake story'. Does this work as a double negative kind of like saying 'no, I don't have no money '. Have they put that many arguments that they are in fact tripping up themselves and saying its true? if so lol and #learnhowenglishworks

             This seems to be a stream of denial to avoid dealing with the story that Monica Peterson was not researching the Clinton Foundation and if Monica Peterson was not researching the Clinton Foundation, false and falsely are accurate and appropriate.
You just created two paragraphs of a strawman argument to argue against.

              When I  read the article's claims "out of context" I was very thrilled to learn, how the above sentences

              could be out of context, because they explain the context! LOL.
I expected they would show, the posting was made up.
**TO MY SURPRISE THE WAPO CONFIRMS THAT POST TO BE AUTHENTIC. **And all they do is the false claim, it was out of context.
             </p>
             <p>
              THAT IS SO EMBARASSING. Does Glenn Kessler, who wrote this, have no decency and no shame?
             </p>
             <p>
              How desperate must they be, to make such claims, when everybody can read the facebook-post himself and discover, how "out of context" that is?

               I think Claude d'Estree is probably concerned for his own life now, because whatever Monica found out in Haiti must have been relayed to him as well.

            The author fails to mention this post she made were she specifies that she believes
            <a href="https://archive.is/XV5t0">
             there is human trafficking occurring
            </a>
            in the "Clinton's Caracol Complex". The author leaves this post out of his article, but includes
            <a href="http://i.imgur.com/TmiB2gU.png">
             a more sedate post
            </a>
            she made about Clinton. Because the two posts are linked side by side in almost every context I've seen them in, I have to believe he's seen and read the first post in his research and this is a blatant attempt to deceive his readers. Without the first post, it looks like wild conjecture that she was researching a link between human trafficking and Clinton, which is what this article attempts to portray it as.
           </p>
           <p>
            Also the key "friend" that this article continuously cites to back up their claim Petersen was not investigating Clinton, is a Denver based dominatrix. Not exactly a solid witness to the the professional pursuits Ms. Petersen might have had in Haiti.
           </p>
           <p>
            And still the U.S State Department has not made an official claim about her death. To my knowledge this is the first mainstream publication that has covered her death at all, and the only reason for it to exist is to further discredit "fake news". Something is strange here.

             FAIR RIGHTS OF USE: PLEASE POST AS YOUR OWN ANYWHERE AND EVERYWHERE
            </p>
            <p>
             Having conducted an extensive analysis of the Open Source Investigation, I have  come to the conclusion that what we are seeing played out in the media is a highly orchestrated and concerted effort to censor and dissuade and distract and deflect the American citizen from investigating this case by using fear and threat of prosecution as a tactic to quell momentum.
            </p>
            <p>
             Our own politicians have neatly painted us into a corner with legislation that makes it a crime to even try to investigate the atrocities being committed every day against the world's most vulnerable. This was and has been intentionally structured as such to protect the guilty and to criminalize the innocent.
            </p>
            <p>
             In the midst of such depravity and violence though, I have found the silver lining in this horrible case that has restored my faith in humanity that good people are willing to do great things to protect those who cannot protect themselves and I am forever grateful and pray God grants them the strength to persevere.
            </p>
            <p>
             This Open Source has seemed to have hit a wall and I am here to break down any barriers by helping all of you to continue on by thinking outside the box. I have read some great analysis that warrants further investigation but everyone seems to be asking the same questions or the wrong ones. Does or doesn't Comet Pizza have a basement and are there secret tunnels that lead from the White House or were all the properties adjacent to Comet Pizza bought at the same time.

             All excellent points and questions. The real question is not if this is real, the real question is what questions do we ask so we can stop it? Where do we find victims that do not want to be found? Are they still alive? American? Money laundering for trafficking?
            </p>
            <p>
             Greed and Lust are synonymous with one another the same as any other vice or sin. Big time drug dealers like Cartels do not just peddle one poison and usually that poison is imported from out of the country or farmed out. Trafficking is no different whether it be international orphanages or illegal immigration. All sanctuary cities are complicit including but not limited to city councils and mayors all the way to DC and each district's Senators and Congressmen.
            </p>
            <p>
             I have it on good authority that the reason behind this mass migration of immigrants is merely just rotating fresh product for the monsters. I believe it is simple supply and demand. Just like GLOBAL WARMING is big business for the DNC, HUMAN TRAFFICKING is no different and merely the newest revenue stream for the DNC.
            </p>
            <p>
             Think about the infrastructure that must be in place on both sides of the border to efficiently and effectively mass produce an endless product line of narcotics and bodies. They are one in the same. Cartels use COYOTES to traffic bodies that transport narcotics. What better way to maximize your profits than by having the ability to sell the packaging used to import the narcotic.
            </p>
            <p>
             Virtually 90% of the illegal immigrants that crossed our southern borders did so with the assistance of a COYOTE and that COYOTE is tied to any one of a DOZEN CARTELS. This is fact and the reason why no matter how well our Alphabet Agencies operate, those at the top are constantly undermining the boots on the ground.
            </p>
            <p>
             Most of us here on Planet GLP know the Mena Cocaine connections with the Clintons and Gary Webb's untimely demise and this correlation to HUMAN TRAFFICKING is no different. This enterprise is worth HUNDREDS OF BILLIONS OF DOLLARS a month. These ANIMALS know no limits and abide by no laws because they own the law. The Clinton Foundation and the Clinton Global Initiative were designed to launder the money involved in this enterprise.
            </p>
            <p>
             You are dealing with an entity that is far more sophisticated than we could have ever anticipated with a limitless revenue stream capable of compromising the most virtuous of men and for those that are incorruptible, these ANIMALS use death as a motivator. They will kill you and your family and your family's family. How do you defeat that? Director Comey was said to have had an uprising within his ranks due to his decision not to prosecute Clinton and this scenario is why.
            </p>
            <p>
             Anyone that even gets close to any evidence is dead before they even knew what they were dealing with. I believe good men and women inside our Alphabet Agencies are truly behind these leaks and hacks because they knew the sheer magnitude and scope of those involved was greater than all the manpower they have at all the Agencies combined.
            </p>
            <p>
             Couple this with the recent leaks by FBI Agents regarding the connection to Weiner's sexting scandal and Clinton's email scandal and it is easy to see to the trained eye that the WikiLeak Hacks of the DNC were indeed state sponsored by our own GOVERNMENT. The NSA and FBI knew of these atrocities and needed to implement a plan of action
            </p>
            <p>
             This in congruence with the fact that an Operation of this size would almost have certainly infiltrated these Agencies and just 1 mole could jeopardize the entire case hence the facade of an OPEN SOURCE INVESTIGATION quarterbacked by the very Agencies tasked to execute such an investigation. This was done for a multitude of reasons.
            </p>
            <p>
             DIRECTIVES AND OBJECTIVES
            </p>
            <p>
             FIRST AND FOREMOST) OPSEC: What better way to hide such an enormous investigation than out in the open amongst the public with the facade of a Civilian led effort.
            </p>
            <p>
             SECOND) PLAUSIBLE DENIABILITY: This allows the heads of each Agency to keep all pertinent info and expenditures off the books and away from prying eyes.
            </p>
            <p>
             THIRD) COUNTER-INTEL: Controlling the chain of evidence in a public forum allows each Agency to smoke out compromised assets also known as moles. Various Social Media platforms are being utilized to categorize different areas of INTEL.
            </p>
            <p>
             FOURTH) DISINFORMATION: The narrative being perpetrated on the American Public that this is FAKE NEWS is a beacon for Agencies to trace those complicit in pushing this propaganda like crumbs to the cookie jar. This will allow the various Agencies to monitor said cookie jar to see how many hands are in it.
            </p>
            <p>
             FIFTH) TRIAGE: Each Agency will have the unique ability to vet which Media Outlets are complicit and the individuals carrying the water for those involved at the top. The propaganda mills are a treasure trove of actionable intel.
            </p>
            <p>
             SIXTH) ARRAIGNMENT: Media outlets that have been cleared and were trying to be part of the solution will help rectumfy the problem. These ANIMALS will be tried in the court of public opinion where journalism will sort fact from fiction. This will save tax payers tremendously to re-allocate such funds where they are crucially needed.
            </p>
            <p>
             SEVENTH) EXECUTION: No explanation necessary
            </p>
            <p>
             EIGHTH) CLASSIFIED

              Some one can do a business plan and figure out how much they should be able to make. Check against the records that are public to what they make. That tells you the base to draw the logical conclusion of money laundering or not. I have done a post on Lucien who works for Saudi oil conglomerate who was at the Comet Pizza when the supposed gun man walked in. Why was he there, do those he represent own it and the other business in area? Click my posts to see what I have found so far. May be a link to the Saudi end of this who knows what he really does. One link shows SOS John Kerry in a meeting with the group. Very strange Lucien was there that day, just saying.
