            posted on Linkin Park's facebook account is strangely worded... There truly seems to be a double meaning in here :
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             Weâ€™re trying to remind ourselves that the demons who took you away from us were always part of the deal. After all, it was the way you sang about those demons that made everyone fall in love with you in the first place. You fearlessly put them on display, and in doing so, brought us together and taught us to be more human. You had the biggest heart, and managed to wear it on your sleeve.
            </p>
           </blockquote>
           <p>
            What if the demons they're talking about are ALSO to be taken literally ?!...
           </p>
           <p>
            (I know... A few weeks ago, I would've laughed at the idea that demons are a real thing, but now with all I've read, the discussions I've found on youtube comments and elsewhere, I'm wondering... "Stranger than fiction", they say...)

            They focused on Comet Pizza because it's not a place they stored kids for long periods of time. It's just where they hold rituals/orgies and let people network with other people who are into more depraved shit.

            It was easy to clean up and Alefantis was chummy with the police and charismatic(these people are psychopaths. Their charisma is their weapons).  He'd be perfect to bring into the spotlight to say "Hey, look. Nothing to see here. Noting interesting whatsoever."
           </p>
           <p>
            Ironically it's shit like that which convince me even more. They skirt over the disturbing shit. They make this weird strawman to attack the accusations, and don't actually discuss anything about the ACTUAL accusations. To anyone who's read the emails it's obvious they are being intentionally deceitful.

              Yeah but why did she kill him?  Maybe the poor soul was going to rehab and trying to break from the Luciferian controllers in his life?  He was a big pop star then if he came out dropping names they could have a somewhat minor/middle sized PR problem on their hands.  Anyhow I dont think she personally killed him she just organized the Private Detectives to hunt Kurt down....then I think she called in her Luciferian contacts and they got rid of him.....it helps when you commit these crimes in a location that is totally controlled....from the Police to the body disposal service.....Seattle is one of these places.....seems they control the whole program in Detroit, Los Angeles.  They dominate most every place but some places they have total control.  Like some parts of Texas where they sent the Supreme Court guy to either die or to fake his death there.....only two sheriff detectives saw the body?  A pillow was over his head and they only call a coroner and get her phone approval to dispose the body with no investigation?  On a Supreme Court Judge?  They have figured out if you control all the main media......and control the local laws.....and control any agencies that might be able to investigate a cover up....then they are free to do and say whatever they want.....no one can prove otherwise.  This is what makes me not totally sure they even have to kill these people.   They can be shipping them out to an undisclosed Japanese Island or sending them to Offut Airforce base for another major :Luciferian Ceremony...I can imagine them gathering a group of people that they have told the world is dead.....for their Halloween blow out Jamboree.....where they probably spare no expense to put on a real show for the big Rothschilds, Bushes, Royal families of Europe.  That kind of trash...
             </p>
             <p>
              I dont even think the 9/11 hostages died on the planes....I think they flew them to Offut and slaughtered them in a Satanic Ceremony for the super big wigs......I think the planes that hit the towers were drones.  The Pentagon plane was not even a plane but a missile....there is no evidence at all it was a plane.

               About Kurt Cobain. I don't know about the occult and the music industry in his case, maybe it has a role in it, but... If you watch "Soaked in Bleach", you can read between the lines that Courtney Love called the detective not long after the supposed time of Kurt's death... 
His documentary convinced me even more that she had something to do with his death. (I believe she 'allegedly' had someone kill him. At some point, a guy (don't remember the name) confessed to people he had been paid 50.000$ to kill him. He was later found dead)
              </p>
              <p>
               The so-called suicide letter was probably about leaving Nirvana &amp; Seattle, and to explain why he wouldn't do the tour they were about to do, that would have make Kurt and Courtney a lot of money.... (the last lines are different and are the only one that suggest that it is a suicide letter... The detective also found in Courtney's bag a paper with letters looking like Kurt's writing, as if she was trying to replicate his writing...)
              </p>
              <p>
               He 'allegedly' was also gonna divorce her. (and his lawyer said he asked for Courtney to be deleted from his will not long before his death)
              </p>
              <p>
               My theory is that he ran into her after he left rehab (he quit early, I believe that was because Courtney was threatening him), and had to tell her he was leaving her, and that's when things must have taken a turn for the worst. She must have had the confirmation that he was leaving with Kristen Pfaff because the detective said that Kurt had 2 plane tickets on him...
              </p>
              <p>
               The rumour says that he fell in love with Kristen Pfaff (at the time, bassist of Hole, Courtney's band). 
Of course Courtney wouldn't have it. She would have lost the fortune HE made, and lost her man(/puppet in her mind I'm sure) to one of her bandmates. As a manipulative psychopath, she refused to let them have their happy ending... Both Kurt and Kristen seemed to have a gentle soul. :) She died 2 months later in similar weird circumstances.
              </p>
              <p>
               I also believe the title "live through this" and some of the lyrics of the album are mentioning their deaths...  For example, "I'm the one with no soul... one above and one below". Well at some concert, she changed it to "one above and TWO below...".
              </p>
              <p>
               And to finish on the subject, if it isn't enough : all of Kurt's relatives and friends said he wasn't suicidal at all. The thing in Rome wasn't a suicide attempt, the doctor confirmed it later to the detective. Only Courtney said it was... Makes me think it was premeditated...

            It doesn't matter if he was murdered or not. It leads to the real agenda of Total Global Enslavement under a one-world religion, currency, government and AI.
           </p>
           <p>
            Tom DeLonge, John Podesta, Mitt Romney, Evan McMullin, Paul Ryan, the Emanuels, and Ashton Kutcher are all middle men to the real elite tied to the Pilgrims Society, Trilateral Commission, CFR, Committee of 300, Black Nobility and Council of 13. Racine, Wisconsin is a main Root and model for the real agenda which is Total Global Enslavement through Sustainability and Community Policing (including chip implants).
           </p>
           <p>
            We know the real reason why Paul Ryan was on the plane with Bill Clinton and Loretta Lynch. Racine is the "ROOT" and key to the Fate of the World.

              Yes, and they are the first in America to do so. The first of many more ahead. Soon they will declare it mandatory. It will become The Mark of the Beast, and they will use AI and Community Policing to enforce it.

             First time I heard Ryan was on the plane....any links to that?  Would love it to be true....anyway we can even try to prove it?  I am not doubting you but can you give us something more solid?  I hear we only heard about Bill and Loretta because the FBI agents around her ratted her out.  Any site reporting Paul Ryan was there?
            </p>
            <p>
             Is the whole Â¨To Make a MurdererÂ¨ story involved with the Wisconsin corruption?  The locals that set that guy up Luciferians and they tie into the whole structure right?  IF we can tie the Â¨To Make a MurdererÂ¨ to Pizzagate we might be able to Redpill a lot of Â¨normiesÂ¨ that watched that show and are convinced they set him up.

              Anonymous and Larry Nichols both corroborated that Paul Ryan was indeed on the plane with Clinton and Lynch.

              To Make a Murderer is absolutely linked to the corruption in Wisconsin through the network of Freemasons, mafia, churches, corporations and other secret societies including Pilgrims Society, Knights of Pythias, Royal Order of Jesters and others that lead to Black Nobility and Council of 13. Sometimes they become too brazen and make mistakes as they did in To Make a Murderer, but there will never be justice as the entire system is corrupt and broken. They will do anything to silence the truth, and there is a rich history of Satanic Ritual Abuse and murder throughout the area. There is a ratline from Chicago up to Canada and over to Iowa (to Omaha and eventually Colorado) and Minnesota (to the Dakota pipelines).

              Wisconsin is an epicenter for Pizzagate and Global Criminal Corruption. Racine is their headquarters where they meet on the shores of Lake Michigan, part of the Great Lakes that they are using corrupt public private partnerships to control as part of Sustainable Development and Agenda 2030.

              The reason Paul Ryan is so powerful is because of the corrupt factions and secret societies that he represents and the real Truth and Agenda they are hiding in his district.

            I myself believe Chester was biological son of John Podesta, Chester got to close to information about the Elite Pedos, and like Beau Biden , he was killed. Probably, by same person/s who killed Chris. Killed on Chris's Birthday, was a message to probably Chester's wife or other members of Chester's inner circle.
