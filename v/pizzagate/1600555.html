            This article connects the Hawiian bureaucrat who released Barack Obama's birth certificate, Loretta Fuddy, to the Subud cult.  it must be noted that Fuddy died under mysterious circumstances thereafter.

           <p>
            The following is a publication of the Subud group congratulating itself on putting its member, Loretta Fuddy, in place just in time to release Obama's birth certificate. The relevant article is on pages 21-22.

             It also is a delicious fact that our Subud sister, Ms Fuddy, just was appointed to her post in the Health Dept in Hawaii in time to be involved in the documentation of fact that Obama was born there.

            I personally find the conversation between Obama and his stepfather Lolo Soetoro contained in the article at the first link to be quite chilling.
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             Obama also provides an insight into his stepfather’s psychology as a killer, one which is now so apparent in Obama himself. Obama reports the following in praise of his stepfather, and as a major lesson in his life:
            </p>
            <p>
             “Have you ever seen a man killed?” I asked him.
            </p>
            <p>
             He glanced down, surprised by my question.
            </p>
            <p>
             “Have you?” I asked again.
            </p>
            <p>
             “Yes,” he said.
            </p>
            <p>
             “Was it bloody?”
            </p>
            <p>
             “Yes.”
            </p>
            <p>
             I thought for a moment. “Why was the man killed? The one you saw?”
            </p>
            <p>
             “Because he was weak.”
            </p>
            <p>
             “That’s all?”
            </p>
            <p>
             Lolo shrugged. “That’s usually enough. Men take advantage of weakness in other men.  They’re just like countries in that way.  The strong man takes the weak man’s land. He makes the weak man work in his fields.  If the weak man’s woman is pretty, the strong will take her.  Which would you rather be?”
            </p>
            <p>
             I didn’t answer, and Lolo squinted up at the sky. “Better to be strong,” he said finally, rising to his feet. “If you can’t be strong, be clever and make peace with someone who is strong.  But always better be strong yourself. Always.”
            </p>
           </blockquote>
           <p>
            This exchange and others like it have influenced Barack Obama.

            This will be the deepest hole yet when everyone is ready to investigate Subud cult the connection to Obamas background. And recognize his mother is not whe he says she is. The release of the forged birth certificates not 2012 was an obvious clue.'The woman who released it was "miracuasly"'placed as head of the records in Hawaii right before he released it in 2012 was part of Subud cult. She mysteriously died not that long after in a bizzare plane crash. Loretta Fuddy.
           </p>
           <p>
            His step-father was also "allegedly" a member of Subud cult.'
           </p>
           <p>
            The motherload I believe is when everyone is ready to get into the Tavi ring &amp; escalen and how all of this relates from WW11 even prior and what is happening now.

             I was one of the people looking into the Tavi ring a month or two ago. I think that is "THE" mother of all rabbit holes as well.

              Yes I have direct some direct knowledge and first person witness testimony that connects the dots between Freud, the inner circle of Hitler (the black sun) the earliest work on trauma based mind control, and Tavi.. 
Also witness to the connection to escalen.

              Most people do not realize what evil is really underneath this. When Tav has been mentioned it is quickly taken down.

               You're right. I've tried to shout out about them be4 on Twat and it was basically shawdowbanned. They are the center of it all.  Ironically all "medical" studies seem to filter from them re: mental disorders, transG and now pushing pedos have a "disease". They also control the think tanks for media-brain control.

               Also before the latest Wiki dump, they had a small clip vid. The embassy cat on a piece of paper. The paper was GCHQ and the pen laying next to it was NSA. They are in bed with each other.

             If you read the first article, it's actually through Obama's mother that he's linked to Subud and all of this. She was probably a CIA 'honeypot'.
