It\'s silly that this kind of destabilization of our country is allowed under the protection of First Amendment.</p>',

               Yeah people that don't know will. But we have to spread the info and let people know about it. The only problem with that is we can't exactly go to twitter and other places like that where the sleeping public is because they will immediately ban your account for damage control. We see it time and time again. Fuck this is frustrating as fuck.

             Not moaning, but...  I just don't have time to go through a list of links.  Ideally I at least want a "headline."    I guess it may be quicker to just open them all as tabs and do a quick scan for anything interesting.  If it wasn't you

             I would probably have skipped the post.  I have no illusions that I am a best practitioner of presentation, but this whole data storm has to be got under control.

             Board members below were paragons of virtue, the great and the good, before pizzagate, but now they are prime suspects!  Clearly ICMEC is a highly suspicious outfit.  I noticed that with the World Wildlife Fund Princes Philip and Bernhard [he the Bilderberg originator] used charity money to save animals to fund their hunting activities.  Wolves guarding the sheepfold - it is an old trick!  Many charities seem to be just cover to perpetrate the ills they appear to ameliorate.

             The International Center for Missing &amp; Exploited Children held its first Board of Directors meeting in May 1998. It was officially launched in April 1999 by Hillary Clinton, then-First Lady of the United States,** and Cherie Blair, wife of British Prime Minister Tony Blair. ICMEC HISTORY / FOUNDING

             List of directors - or speakers at conference - starting with Ernest E Allen  Founder &amp; Former CEO of ICMEC and including Jeff Koons [artist] and link to ART FOR TOMORROW CONFERENCE | Marina Abramavic, Dakis Joannou, Larry Gagosian also in attendance. They all go back a ways.. Dakis Joannou owns a yacht named “Guilty” which was designed by Jeff Koons.

             OK  I'll try to "open all tabs" approach.

            Actually, I think it is because the narrative they want present, is that Trump is Hilter.  By making JP a member of the press, they want to squeal that Trump is going after the sacred protectors of our democracy when he finally makes the arrest.
