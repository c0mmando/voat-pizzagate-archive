<p>Hello Crimestoppers!</p>
<p>The Old Hypothesis: </p>
<p>Marina Abramovic is a high-ranking satanic witch used to facilitate rituals for the elites.</p>
<p>The New Hypothesis: 	</p>
<p>She is a CIA/DynCorp asset, working with non-official cover, and is used by them as a traveling sales show to promote CIA/Dyncorp’s line of human “products”.</p>
<p>Her Cleansing the Mirror performance, Spirit Cooking ritual and Gala events (from 1995 onward) are merely advertisements for the CIA/Dyncorp’s spoils of war in the Balkans.  Let’s not under-estimate the importance of a good marketing strategy.  To sell your products, one needs to alert the public that products are at market.  This is her purpose.  
</p>
<p>What products?</p>
<p>Part 1: Human Bones</p>
<p>It’s certainly an interesting coincidence that Marina Abramovic is Serbian and the Serbs where one of the major participants in genocidal acts in the Balkans region.  Look at a timeline of events there, and the events in her life:</p>
<p>1989 Marina Abramovic: splits with her life-work partner Ulay and calls it the most important year of her life.</p>

<p>1989 in Yugoslavia: Massive Protests and resignations of Yugoslav leaders, at this time it seems inevitable that the Yugoslavian state will split into smaller ones along ethnic lines. </p>

<p>What’s a major product of a genocide?  Lot’s of corpses.  What can one do with a corpse?  Sell the bones. Here are some examples of incomplete skeletons selling up to $3,300: </p>

<p>What was the world demand for human skeletons like at the time in 1995?  Hard to know without asking someone in the business, but I did manage to find an article, which states:</p>
<p>“In 1985…the Indian government outlawed the export of human remains, and the global supply of skeletons collapsed. Western countries turned to China and Eastern Europe, but those regions produce relatively few skeletons...”</p>
<p><a href="https://www.wired.com/2007/11/ff-bones/">https://www.wired.com/2007/11/ff-bones/</a></p>
<p>What if in 1995 they turned again to Eastern Europe for skeletons?</p>
<p>In 1995 Marina Abramovic created a piece called “Cleansing the Mirror”.  In this performance she is literally cleaning a human skeleton with a sponge and soap as a “performance”.  If  we interpret her actions now as a sales pitch, the message becomes glaringly obvious, &quot;look - we\'ve got nice, new, clean and prepared skeletons for sale.&quot;</p>

<p>Why is it important to set her up as a professor?</p>
<p>I think it gives the buyer a sense of security.  All she has to do is say, “I’m Professor Marina Abramovic and I have a connection to bones in Serbia, would you like to purchase any?”  Sounds a lot better than, “Hey, I’m a random person you don’t know, and I can get you bones from murdered victims in Bosnia.”  Another reason for her to be positioned as a professor is because she now has credibility and further access to invade art space on any university campus that is willing to schedule a performance with her.  The hope here being a chance encounter with people you want to sell bones to: anatomy/kinesiology/biology/nurse/medical professors, researchers, students, other artists and bone collectors ( yes, they exist: <a href="http://www.skullsunlimited.com">http://www.skullsunlimited.com</a> ).</p>
<p>End of Part 1 of 3</p>
<p>Part 2 of 3 Coming later this week ☺ </p>
<p>What is Spirit Cooking marketing? Why involve John and Tony Podesta?</p>
<p>Interesting to note is that her choice for the title Cleansing the Mirror.  It is the name of an actual Wiccan Ritual. Maybe a way to psychologically cope with looking into a mirror (if you don’t like your reflection that is)?</p>',

            Are people aware that Abramovic is a really famous artist, in her own right? Not saying that discredits this, but sometimes I get the feeling that PG-ers lack context.

            I agree, I'm just pointing out that she titled her piece after a known Wiccan ritual used for dealing with bad/negative energy.  It's not a Crowley ritual.  The "cleansing the house" is so common that I've known good, albeit superstitious, Christians do this bullshit.  The "cleansing the mirror" is also included in this ritual and also has to do with the bad/negative energy one feels when looking in a specific mirror.

            I'm not going to comment on your commentary regarding Wiccan rituals. I don't blame people for not knowing or understanding the occult and it's many shapes and forms.
            <br/>
            I will however comment on Abramovic and the CIA thing. 
So...I've tried repeatedly to post this info and some stupid crap always happens before I succeed. We'll see if it takes this time. 
Marina Abramovic was born November 30 1946. I'm just making this understood. 
Crowley had two very devoted fans/friends you may have heard of; Ron Hubbard &amp; Jack Parsons. L.Ron Hubbard has been made famous (or infamous) by his book Dianetics &amp; subsequent founding of Scientology. 
Jack Parsons was THE Jack Parsons of rocket science and NASA. I don't think I need to elaborate too much on Hubbard, but Parsons was at one time basically excommunicated from NASA for his well known satanic rituals etc. NASA actually said they were drawing a line where he was concerned, and he basically lost all  support from NASA and was cut off. 
Enter the daughter of the Black Dahlia Killer: 
In her book Daddy Was The Black Dahlia Killer, Janis Knowlton wrote of Parsons and Hubbard performing what is known as the "Moonchild" ritual OR "Babylon Working" (Crowley's most important ritual as written about in Moonchild, a fictional novel based on the actual ritual involving the physical manifestation of the Scarlet Woman(an elemental) through the birth of a child) From January through March of 1946. The "actual" impregnation was performed in early March. 
Crowley, has been known for being involved in CIA  for many many years now. 
Again, Marina Abramovic was born November 30, 1946. 
I don't know what, if anything, this might mean. I don't know that Abramovic is the "Moonchild" or not. What I do know is the dates are fucking weird. The coincidence is really really too much to ignore. 
Also, I have a history in the occult, and there is not one single recorded historical account of this ritual ever EVER being performed. And I certainly have never seen more substantiated evidence than this. You can do searches and find more than enough to be convinced this really happened in 1946 with those two individuals. 
I'm not interested in creating threads/ topics here. If anyone else finds this interesting, I hope that you will create a conversation. I think it's well worth the time and attention. Also take note that according to Abramovics own bio, her "bio parents" were ex military/political figures. 
Love to all of you and your dedication. 
Light white candles. Sprinkle salts. Keep safe. &lt;3

            Edit: here's a Wiki page on it : en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Babalon_Working
           </p>
           <p>
            I can find links to other sources and info, but I need to work early am. I'll be around sometime tomorrow Eve.

            This is 100% consistent with George Webb. He thinks that the cannibalism painting in Podesta's office is an advertisement for organs too.

             At uni we always talked about political office and executive positions at corporations being a kind of "revolving-door" of people being shifted back and forth.  We weren't hip enough at the time to connect CIA agents/analysts and university professors/researchers being another one.  Just look up Rutgers, Yale, Harvard etc. and I'm positive the coincidences are all there.
