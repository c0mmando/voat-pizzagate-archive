<p>“The other issue that surfaced at the time was a colossal error in judgment by one of the contractors\' employees in hiring an adolescent boy dancer for some sort of event that, at least to most folks, looked very inappropriate. The Post is now looking at the dancing boy, which was not included in the April 17, article&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;the DynCorp regional commander from Konduz, Flint Chambers, allowed his men to hire a 15-year-old boy dancer to do tribal dances at a DynCorp party on the training site. Some 15 or so DynCorp employees in attendance pulled out a single chair and had the boy do mock lap dances. This was captured on video. The video shows DynCorp employees putting dollar bills in the boy\'s waistband, just as they would a stripper\'s garter. The revelry lasted about 45 minutes.&quot;</p>
<p>This is sent directly to Hillary Clinton from Cheryl Mills who is one of her big time lawyers. A lawyer would not be messaging Hillary this if she didn\'t have direct ties to DynCorp.
DynCorp was actually found guilty of child trafficking in the early 2000\'s when &quot;its employees [were] accused of rape and the buying and selling of girls as young as 12.&quot;  They got a slap on the wrist and still get government contracts. </p>

<p>DynCorp is known for a gross history of sexual assault. The CEO is Lewis Von Thaer. But the parent organization of DynCorp Cerebus Capital Management.</p>
<p>Hillary Clinton has ties to both Cerebus and DynCorp. Cerebus gave $40,628 to her campaign.

<p>What\'s ironic is that they appointed Jack Lew (Hillary\'s right hand man, according to the article) to look into it. DynCorp has a history of stealing money. &quot;1991 State of the Nation - It appears that DynCorp broke the original investigation on this. DynCorp was the accountant for roughly $2.7 trillion missing 1991-2001. Also missing in 1996 or 1997; $60 billion missing out of HUD. DynCorp appears to be the accounting division of the US government these days.&quot; Source - <a href="http://www.newsfollowup.com/clinton_9-11_truth_wtc_israel_saudi_arabia_uk_nuclear_demolition_president_election_hillary_bush_2016.html">http://www.newsfollowup.com/clinton_9-11_truth_wtc_israel_saudi_arabia_uk_nuclear_demolition_president_election_hillary_bush_2016.html</a> / <a href="http://archive.is/1MJwq">http://archive.is/1MJwq</a></p>
<p>Hillary covered up for DynCorp.
1. The Washington Post wrote about it to her.
2. Later they publish a story saying the DynCorp employee was fired and no mention of the boy.
3. Nothing ended up being done. </p>

            Fantastic post. You really opened my eyes a bit more. To answer your question "why all the law enforcement in your country doesn't put this woman in jail?" I believe the answer is very deep, and disturbing. If Trump is who he says he is, he may pursue something like this. But this corruption and child trafficking is a symptom of elite control for thousands of years. I believe it validates most of what the guy David Icke has been saying for over 20 years. There's forces beyond our conception pulling the strings. And, at that level, there is a regime change, reflected on earth as Hillary, Sorros and the Democrats vs. Trump and Russia

            Thank you for posting this.
I watched the movie and right now am literally disgusted more than I already have been since this topic has been revealed.
           </p>
           <p>
            Our soldiers were asked to tolerate the Afghani culture and child rape is part of that culture. This is sickening.
Hillary is not in jail because of corrupt liberals and coward republicans too scared to stand up for anything.
           </p>
           <p>
            I would like to know who in the hell told our soldiers to "tolerate" this "Bacha Bazi" boy play shit. I would like to know all the way up.
           </p>
           <p>
            Hillary needs to be locked up, so does Obama, and most of his staff.
           </p>
           <p>
            I won't be over the Dancing Boys Of Afghanistan for a while. Our government supports this I'm disgusted.

             But if you don't tolerate it, how can you operate in the Afghan society where it is considered OK?  Are military troops supposed to be social engineers too?

             This kind of problem is one reason why many people oppose foreign entanglements altogether.

              There's no excuse for this sick shit.
Did you watch the film?
Those men, if you want to call them that are fucked up. They enslave women to wearing literally cages, yet dress up young boys to dance and wear dresses, starting at 11. 
Foreign entanglements or not it's gross.

               I watched that quite a while ago, and yes, it's sick.  The problem is that it's also common over there.  Do you want military troops trying to alter the culture?  That isn't their function, and having them do it causes other problems.  The point I'm trying to get across is that tolerating it causes problems, and not tolerating it causes problems.  This is because
               <strong>
                American troops don't belong in Afghanistan.
               </strong>

            Wtf does DynCorp do? What kind of corporation is this? I've never heard of it. Obviously this entity has some serious backers to skate through all this illegal mess. Child trafficking... terrible. This place should be shut down and the perps prosecuted. It just goes to show , the more money you have , the less you are accountable for.

            Dyncorp is owned by Cerberus. Is it just me or does every lead in pizzagate seem to have some reference to Greek mythology?  We have Alefantis which is a greek name (more commonly spelled Alifantis) ,  middle name Achilles, Cerberus, Pegasus, what is the relation between all these people and companies with ancient Greece?  I have read that pedophilia was the norm in ancient Greece. Are they subtlely referring to the society they hope to impose upon modern times?
           </p>
           <p>
            I'm sure I've seen more references to Greek mythology in these investigations but I haven't the time to go back through the posts.

            The name of the asset management firm owning DynCorp is not Cerebus, but Cerberus. You know, the multi-headed attack dog of Greek underworld God Hades.
           </p>
           <p>
            And that name is probably the only honest thing about them. They are politically extremely connected financial vultures, interested in 'distressed assets'. Headed for the past twenty years by Dan Quayle. Bush Sr.'s hapless attack dog.

              Moreover, the British report was not the first such case reported. In fact, it followed on the heels of a report from Portugal. On November 27, 2002, the press reported a scandal of pedophile ring run from a state orphanage. The Guardian reported that the scandal threatened to engulf diplomats, media personalities and senior politicians. Photographs of senior government officials with young boys from Lisbon's Casa Pia orphanage were among the evidence. More shocking however, were the revelations that systematic sexual abuse of children at the home had allegedly been going on for more than 20 years and had been known to police and other authorities for most of that time.

              On January 14, 2002, Insight Magazine reported the charges leveled by Ben Johnson against his employer Dyncorp, a major defense contractor. Johnson charged that officials and employees of Dyncorp were engaging in perverse, illegal and inhumane behavior and were purchasing illegal weapons, women, forged passports and participating in other immoral acts. Johnson had witnessed his supervisors and fellow employees buying 12- to 15-year-olds as sex slaves.

            Perhaps it's because you are not an American, but Clinton covered up for Weiner in 2011?  This makes no sense.  Weiner was exposed in 2011 and had to resign from Congress.
           </p>
           <p>
            The cover up you allege involves Jennifer Palmieri forwarding a NEWS ARTICLE about the POLICE investigating the incident.  So this was 
A. public and being widely reported by the press.
B. Police were already involved.
C. As it turns out the police closed their investigation the next day and declared nothing illegal occurred.
           </p>
           <p>
            Here's the article
            <a href="http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2011/06/10/exclusive-weiners-messages-to-teenage-girl-in-delaware-draw-police-attention/#ixzz1Ouk9EaSv">

            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            This article is also from June 2011.  The Weiner sexting scandal broke on May 27th, 2011.  This was also reported in other outlets. This was front page news in NYC.  The police investigation was closed because they examined her computer and didn't find anything and the 17 year old said
            <a href="http://www.nydailynews.com/news/politics/weinergate-twit-tweeted-teen-article-1.129271">
             she didn't receive any inapproprate messages or images from Weiner
            </a>
            , i.e. no crime was committed.
           </p>
           <p>
            Your allegation has everything backwards.  The email and the OOF content are the Clinton team LEARNING more details of the Weiner scandal.
           </p>
           <p>
            Weiner's 2011 scandal involved sketchy but legal activity.  He sent a picture a 22 year old woman.

            Fun fact: As many know, Claude D'Estree, who is murdered researcher Monica Petersen's colleague and is the most outspoken about her not investigating the Clinton Foundation, previously worked for DynCorp. However, D'Estree didn't just work for DynCorp - he was their direct link to the US Attorney's Office during DynCorp's biggest child trafficking scandal which took place in Bosnia in 1999. The US Attorney's Office that should have been prosecuting DynCorp, but never did. That whole incident was so big it literally got turned into a Hollywood movie called
            <em>
             the Whistleblower
            </em>
            with Rachel Weisz. (

               I have thought about this a lot. I'm thinking no. I'm thinking it has more to do with how we lay out the story. Now that were this far along we put out these facts first. George Webb style. And then we back it up in the opposite direction to pizza gate .  We make very sure in our presentation that this is about pizzagate,  but in order to understand pizzagate viewers have to understand these corporate government connections first.  How it all lead to pizzagate.

            The second sentence is not evidence of the first.  Anyone can make donate political contributions and when you do, you have to include your job title and your employer.  That is how Open Secrets is able to say Cerebus Capital gave this much money.  You need not have any connection to the candidate or the candidate to you to make a donation.
            <br/>
            If you look at the Totals Tab from your link you see that Cerebus gave 1 million dollars to Republican recipients and $400,000 to Democratic recipients, so it doesn't seem to be a particularly Clinton Aligned company.  Paul Ryan got almost as much contributions as Hillary did.  If you look at total contributions to Republican presidential candidates, the donations to Clinton are dwarfed 65% to 35%.

             Yes, republicans are implicated in pizzagate. That is not surprising, and this is not about
             <em>
              only
             </em>
             Hillary. It is much larger than that.
            </p>
            <p>
             There is no contradiction in Cerberus' donation to both parties, that's how corruption works. Donald Rumsfeld defended Dyncorp and was also a warmongering piece of shit.

            Probably good to keep in mind that Monica Petersen's professor/boss at the time of her death in Haiti was Claude d'Estree who between 1999 and 2002 worked in the US Attorney's office on behalf of DynCorp:

             On behalf of?  I don't think you're using that correctly. You could say through DynCorp, but DOJ set the goals.
He was working as a contractor through DynCorp on behalf of the Department of Justice.  The DOJ defined his job responsibilities and tasks and he was working to further DOJ goals.

              HRC first got her hands on FBI files of everyone in power back in 90's. She used those files to blackmail. She still uses the same exact M.O. but now she also has a built in army of people in power positions to protect others from being prosecuted or to only allow prosecutions of select lower level people to keep others in check. (See Petreaus sex scandal) 
So it's really a combination of things that stops justice and exactly why "drain the swamp" is the dog whistle that makes these people do insane things like blame Russia and try to start a war with them.

            This is the big one. Government and Corporations have always colluded. I can't pretend to know why Clinton is untouchable. We usually assume that they are all criminals and thus protect each other.

            I remember Cynthia McKinney and others pursuing the Dyncorp issue of sexual abuse, but that was quashed (as was her congressional career).

            I'm beginning to think that contacting former disaffected congress and staff may yield useful information.

             Yeah, they KNEW because it was being investigated by the police and they LEARNED of it because it reported by Fox News.  The cops determined no crime had occurred after the girl told them nothing inappropriate happened.

            <p>
             This was weeks after the Weiner scandal broke in May of 2011, if you remember the scandal involved a 22 year old woman.
