<p>One more with the logo turned 90 degrees the other direction:  <a href="http://imgur.com/a/dvObO">http://imgur.com/a/dvObO</a></p>
<p><em>Evidence #2:</em>
NOW, let\'s have another look at the logo seen repeatedly in Season 1 of True Detective, which was about an organized satanic ritual abuse pedophile ring, and which repeatedly showed a symbol similar to the ones the FBI released as Pedo symbols, and which many people state is a known symbol of ritual abuse.  Here is the symbol seen repeatedly in True Detective Season One:</p>

<p>Another example of the spiral symbol from True Detective Season One (this one\'s a bit more disturbing):
<a href="http://imgur.com/a/eAVXe">http://imgur.com/a/eAVXe</a></p>
<p>Another still from the show that shows the symbol that the ritual abuse group in the show uses, this one is from the detective\'s notebook:
<a href="http://imgur.com/a/tUUgK">http://imgur.com/a/tUUgK</a></p>
<p>Probably the clearest image/best example:

<p>A different example of the symbol in the show:

<p>a completely different example from the show:
<a href="http://imgur.com/a/k8n1b">http://imgur.com/a/k8n1b</a></p>
<p>Sadly I cannot find one of the best screenshots from the series that I\'ve seen online before. It shows a giant image of the symbol on a wall/garage door.  I will keep searching for that.</p>
<p><strong>ok here is my attempt at pasting the chipotle logo and the true detective symbols SIDE BY SIDE:</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://imgur.com/a/lGGqC">http://imgur.com/a/lGGqC</a></p>
<p>THEY LOOK EXACTLY THE SAME, don\'t they?</p>
<p>This is all related to PG as it deals with the pedo symbols released by the FBI and finding these symbols hidden everywhere, such as company logos.  This provides probability that these companies may be involved in child trafficking, CP, child sexual abuse, etc.  Or at least that the maker of the logo or owner of the business is involved in organized child sexual abuse.</p>
<p>It\'s hard to not see the connection when you see the images side-by-side.</p>

            Pedophobia is a FEAR.  That is a misnomer. It is not fear that the general public has; it is an understanding of the damage it does to children.  It is seen as abhorrent because it is not consensual; it is the vilest breaking of trust.  Ask any adult survivor who has worked through the trauma of childhood sexual abuse.

            pretty sure the word already exists. maybe not officially-- not sure.  in response to your "is that concerning to [me]"? my honest response is: are you a fan of the false memory syndrome foundation, too?

            I don't think exposure to only or mostly like-minded people is an issue for myself. I certainly do not think the same as everybody else thinks.
I actually don't understand your last sentence.

            "Next, you mention years/decades of research behind the study of child abuse. Frankly, I do not see much organized and useful study here. Mostly, I see a great deal of pedophobia, random injections of useful information that usually goes overlooked, and lots of spurious details."

            I myself have been working on this for about 14 years.  Professionally and personally, but I choose not to discuss my professional work her for multiple reasons.

            I wouldn't be surprised if a lof of PG'ers have a lot more knowledge and experience than you give credit for.  I know there are Dr.s here, PHDs, Master's degree level workers, and one person who mentioned formerly being involved in the government and one mentioning being inside the LA music scene.  I personally am working on my second book on a related topic.  The knowledge a lot of us bring is a lot deeper than one might assume after reading a single post someone puts up.  And I'm sure the work a lot of us do would really amaze and bring some kudos, but of course we gotta keep that under wraps.

            Is there such a thing as 'PEDAR'?   I believe the gays say they have 'GAYDAR'...,some kind of LGBTQ+ IFF. Perhaps the most vurnerable and endangered portion of our society, the ones truly at risk, don't bet their lives on "DAR". Why, when ((THEY)) can simply purchase a common product with the appropriate logo. "How will I recognize you?"  "Will have PEDOBRAND Cookies/Chips in hand."

            no. still not  seeing it. that isn't context, it's just you turning the logo on it's side. the other pics i've seen here do not require the view to turn their head sideways to get it to look like that. anyways, my original argument about was not that it didn't look enough like the pedo logo - ANY swirl could be said to look like that. what i am asking for is a little context that would truly link chilli's to any kind of child trafficking. (trucks bringing groups of kids in the back, eye witness accounts, victims testimonies etc) because without that ... you still just have a swirl.

            I'm not libeling anyone by saying hey let's look at the comparisons here.  you've said something similar to me before.
            <br/>
            I made no assertion, as you stated I did. 
I am not the prosecuting attorney here.  I am part of a team looking into stuff and finding clues, some of which will lead nowhere, some of which will lead to true evils in this world.
burning an innocent witch?? I never said Chipotle was guilty of anything.
           </p>
           <p>
            and in response to you saying it's ridiculous to use the similarity to the symbol in the tv show, that is ignoring the existence of the FBI's published BoyLover symbols and the connection to this topic.  and ignoring the fact that I (and many others) are approaching this topic with years of research behind us (or even decades) and that there are known things exposed in this show that relate to ritual child sexual abuse (such as people wearing animal masks while abusing kids), organized child abuse rings, and MKultra.  this isn't just blindly believing some tv show.

            Soon assistant manager Gerardo Solis was regularly touching her and “grooming” her for sex at a Chipotle in Houston, Texas. By the summer of 2014, it got to the point where he would have unprotected sex with her “at the restaurant dumpster, in the restroom, in the office and other places,” the lawsuit states.

            I've thought you were a shill from the first comment you made to me.  you immediately cite a lack of logic instead of seeking more info to have a better understanding, and that's been the case with other comments you've made to me.  True Detective Season 1 is highly important in the PG investigation. This mainstream television discussed the REALITIES of satanic ritual abuse, child pornography, and more, and it is widely known that the symbolism they use is similar to actual ritual abuse symbolism-- in fact, its amazing how far that show went and that they used these known symbols.  that show went in depth into real issues that are nearly NEVER talked about, especially in any mainstream media.
           </p>
           <p>
            It is absolutely worth looking at the similarities (or exact likeness?) between the Chipotle symbols and the TD symbol.  Saying otherwise is suspect to me.

            Look at the spiral on the Walmart Great Value products? Is this not a FBI Pedo symbol?
Look on the Restaurant Style white corn tortilla chips only a spiral, swirl on one side of package! This is a Pedo symbol!

             I'm not finding the chips, but I see the Twist and Shout cookies with the blue spiral.  I think it's somewhat suspicious, probably because it's also blue.
            </p>
            <p>
             I am one of the non-shills who keeps saying spiral are everywhere in nature-- our galaxy is a spiral!  there are spirals everywhere.  the FBI logo is a TRIANGLE spiral, the Chipotle and True Detective Symbols have that triangular spirally quality (lol).  Just spirals... not enough for me.  like I said, the blue color makes it more suspicious.  I'm still open to it being a pedo symbol, but overall I think implicating every spiral is not the best look for PG'ers.  Thoughts?

              I saw the spiral on the twist and shout also, and like you did not think it was, until I saw the chips. Now Google does not show the Great Value Restaurant Style WCTC bag that I have right now?? I wonder if it is new packaging? The swirl is very obvious and on only one side of package and quite out of place😏

                  These images on Walmart site are not the bag of chips I have????
I wonder what is up with that?
Here is the bar code # if that helps?

                 <h1>
                  78742 11453
                 </h1>
                 <p>
                  Also I am not referring to the blue Great Value circle, next to the giant cactus with sombro hat hanging off it there is on left side one black spiral attached to a green little loopy thing! The only black item on entire package, and only one on left side.
imgur.com  says you have to download the app, unfortunately I have no storage on my device for apps.

                 save to desktop, upload to imgur.com (no account needed!) when you upload, a link is created, and you just post that link. super easy. I think you can even do all that with a phone

             It's possible to test random bits of meat by counting the chromosomes.  Cows and humans have a different number of chromosomes.

             One of the toughest steps to take mental is to realize that they are really poisoning us.  The symbols these large international companies pick for their logos are not left up to anything random.

             </a>
             Maybe the company might be unaware but I doubt it...but the advertising agency they hire to do the logo is definetely aware of what is going on.

              Worked in advertising. With major brands. We created logos. We weren't aware of any evil plans. Sometimes graphic designers aren't all that creative.....and there are only so many shapes in the universe... not saying all advertisers are ignorant of what they are doing. Just wanted to bring a dose of reality to the claim that all he 23 year old graphic artists out there have sold their soul to the devil and are knowingly creating this stuff.

               Yeah I am aware of that....but the people who teach this shit might very well be occult.  They put unbelieveable meaning behind symbols....like a picture is worth a thousand words...a symbol is worth a thousand pictures.
              </p>
              <p>
               Fritz Springmeier says as much.  That you cant assume every person who made is symbol that has occult meaning is aware.....but lots are.

            The third image is of a buck's antler's surrounding a spiral. Buck is a term for a child molester, as in Buck's Fishing and Camping in DC.

             very good point.  we also saw an old image of the rothchilds at a party where the woman was wearing antlers, which is similar to a lot of the cult imagery in True Detective Season 1

            You spent an awful lot of time on your post and I Thank You.  It is as Clear As A Bell.  You also make a very good point that these companies that are trying to disguise these logs (at least it seems so to me) are involved in the global crime ring that we have been researching. This company merits further investigation, imo.
