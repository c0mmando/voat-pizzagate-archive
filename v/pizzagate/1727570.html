            Editor's note: This story originally stated that the stolen laptop contained details of the investigation into Hillary Clinton's use of a private email server, per law enforcement officials. A law enforcement official has since told ABC News that the Secret Service did not investigate Clinton's emails and there would have been no reason for such information to be on a Secret Service laptop. This story has been updated accordingly.

            Thanks for your take.  I agree that the zero hedge article could be a threat.  This seems to be a cat and mouse game at the moment.  I just saw on my local news that Melania &amp; Barron will be moving in to the WH.  I believe Trump must have set things up to secure the situation.  Otherwise they would not be allowed in.  We shall find out soon about the laptop caper.  This did not happen for nothing.  There was a reason. Someone pointed out that the floor plans are available for all to obtain, so that is not a factor.  I think Trump might have chosen Pence in order to expose him for what he is.  A traitor to Trump and willing to do anything that Hillary would have done.

            Tried to read all the comments but may have missed it, out of sorts today. These are my ideas,  let me know if you see a flaw. I'll break it down to either Trump or Clinton set it up options.
           </p>
           <p>
            Clinton - I can't see madcow (still lol at that) setting this up and not killing off the SS agent at the same time via robbery or something. Otherwise trumps team can easily truth serum or torture the agent for info and the jig is up. The MSM covering the story they kind of have to, if they smelled a set up from trump but tried to suppress the story as per usual, trump could take it to social media like normal, kick off his own false flag and coupled with the media shutting down the story, they just hung themselves right there, that would be damning.
           </p>
           <p>
            Trump - Wouldn't need to kill off the agent if she's on his team,  Also serves to protect trump tower, now that people think someone has info on it and if something happened, it would draw sympathy and support to him and again, cast suspicion on his political enemies. These SS breaches of security lately could also allow him to make the case that he needs to restructure his SS detail, he needed a reason he couldn't do it out of the gate and just say he didn't trust all of them, that would draw a lot of backlash and give ammo to the enemy. Edit: forgot to add the "leaks" angle but others already said it anyway

            Would make an interesting story if Trump, not personally,  stole the laptop from the SS so he could then have them say it was stolen.
           </p>
           <p>
            Then have anon leak the info that was on the laptop.
           </p>
           <p>
            Here's the catch, there's probably nothing on the laptop. 
. 
The laptop is just a cover for Intel agencies leaking info  to the public.
           </p>
           <p>
            Now any real documents leaked can be claimed to have been access via SS computer. In other words the laptop is a red hearing to distract from the true source of the leaks. That of course being trump and Co, among with patriotic Intel agency members, and military /police

            I thought every SS agent drives around with FBI evidence loaded on a laptop and left in a car. Its got to be CIA because only CIA can create such stupid scenarios. Its like all the retarded CIA agents are on Team Pedo.

            Side note: Catholicism is essentially a variation of Gnosticism used for power, corruption, and wealth that adopts and perverts the Bible, which is the source of all truth according to actual faith based believers. The best way to sell a lie is to include truth, thus you get Catholicism, Islam. Other non Judeo/Christian belief systems tend to just be mystic feelgood bullshit.

            Everything you said is exactly what I was thinking the minute I saw this story appear on Voat.   All of it just seems fake.   And all the questions you wrote....(logical questions btw) have not been raised or addressed in any way shape or form in the MSM....how dumb do they think we are for fucks sake.

            What has happened here is of extreme importance.
           </p>
           <p>
            The New York Daily news has the best summary but a little hard to tell the bias. Many seeds were planted within the article. (Trump Tower floor plans, Trump and the Russians, A theory that the Thief is from Brighton Beach a Russian enclave. Hillary Clinton's email investigation, threat to National Security, the UN and the Pope.) The lean is towards Trump and the Russians according to the the weight within the article.

           <p>
            The big question is - Was this a white hat or black hat move?

             I guess we all have an opinion on that but the answer doesn't actually solve anything. Good point from you on several seeds.

            Ok this is my take on things.  Take it for what it's worth or not worth. It requires connecting several dots so bear with me.  First i see this security breach connected to last week's security breach when the "fence jumper" was allowed to wander around the White House grounds for 15 minutes before he was "noticed."
Why connected?  Releasing "floor-plans-details" of Trump Tower and security procedures endangers the President.  And this is the second time in a week or so that the SS has allowed incidents that endanger the President.  Security breaches that endanger the President are often taken as warnings of things to come.
Is this part of a bigger picture?  In my mind yes.  Why?  Because Trump is now surrounded by snakes.  The only sane people in Trump's immediate circle in my opinion were Flynn and Sessions.  By sane i mean the only people who want to maintain America's sovereignty and avoid an unnecessary nuclear exchange with Russia.  Now Flynn is gone and Sessions is handcuffed. And neither of them are even accused of doing anything illegal or wrong.  Neither did anything even outside the performance of their normal course of duties. After the Sessions debacle we even have video of Trump exploding and reaming out Bannon in the Oval Office for an hour or so.  This indicates obvious displeasure from Trump, which suggests it (and probably Flynn also) was a maneuver around Trump that was at least done without his full knowledge/approval.
            <br/>
            I suggest this video interview of Paul Craig Roberts on the Richie Allen Show to fill in some of the scenery:
            <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3GZAB2wue5o">
             https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3GZAB2wue5o
            </a>
            As example of what i mean by Trump surrounded with snakes, here's a quick rundown of Bannon's resume:
First job out of college: Goldman Sacks
Left Goldman and launched Bannon &amp; Co where he negotiated the sale of Castle Rock Entertainment to Ted Turner (our friend from CNN fame)
This launched him into the high echelons of the Hollywood Zionist Producer crowd.
After (or maybe during that) he gave seminars at the VATICAN.
From there he dropped out of nowhere after they killed Breitbart, to take over the operation there.
Then again out of nowhere he becomes chief advisor to the President!?!
Could anybody invent a more suspicious NWO resume?
            <br/>
            And everybody else in Trump's inner circle smells the same.
My personal opinion now is Trump is completely surrounded and these "security incidents" are what amount to a "last warning' situation for Trump.
Just my personal view of things.
Peace

             Thanks, a great add to all the theories posted. I would have read even a longer entry on this, the 2nd paragraph took quick steps difficult to follow without background info. So, last warning, huh? The rapeteam must have lost all control then?

              I definitely think Trump needs some friends now.  There could be much more to this than what i can see from the outside, but he is definitely surrounded by snakes.

            I think it could be a number of things. It could be a way for Trump to have Secret Service info on Clinton and the wiretapping get out to the public without his involvement. It could be new emails between HRC and their closer Secret Service agents (I think the Clintons probably have one or two that they don't treat like shit) etc.
           </p>
           <p>
            It could also be complete bullshit, and in many potential forms. It could be some kind of false flag, especially if it's an effort to make the Secret Service look inept, and if so, it's working great.
           </p>
           <p>
            It could also be an isolated fluke incident. I'm not banking on this, but it's a possibility.
           </p>
           <p>
            And of course, it could be a preparatory job for kidnapping Trump's family. The Service publicly stated that it contains the escape route for Trump Tower and a detailed floorplan. I doubt it'd go down as anything apart from an inside job, but this smells like the first step in creating a fake narrative that it was Russia or ISIS or something else.
           </p>
           <p>
            The reports that the laptop has Clinton emails and such isn't necessarily bogus. Were I a disgruntled protector of the Clintons, and I'm sure some of their detail members hate them, I'd keep anything the Service had on them, and I'd keep it close.

            Kind of sounds like a threat to me.  "Expose Hillary's emails and we take down Trump Towers."  I mean who really believes those 2 things would be on a SS laptop left unattended in a car?  That's ridiculous.  And even if for some weird reason they were....they wouldn't disclose that.  The more I think about this, the more I think they are threatening Trump.

             Okay, think about this:  Trump hasn't been to Trump Towers since the inauguration.  They are really threatening Melania and Barron.  To drive Trump nuts with worry?  To force him to move his wife and son to some other location or to DC?

            Exactly. This really made no sense. Especially when MSN tacked on Pope Francis files?

            And then to stress stealing an agent's computer was a criminal offense? Really?

            Just wanted to add that the floor plans would not be downloadable because these are supposedly "secret" hallways, entrances, and exits. Since Trump built it, he wouldn't necessarily have that on record.

            This is a psyop/con... but who is conning the public? Is it the  NYPD so it can be  leaked by "Anonymous"l? Is the Deep State setting the public up for a false flag?  Or Hillary trying to plant additional "emails" that contradict the others on Wikileaks...It's going to soon unfold and we'll all see who benefits from this supposed "theft".

              Obama? Weird how he's not including in this mess? They've allegedly got info on the pope but not Obama on a SS agents laptop? Seriously?

              Part of me thinks MAYBE this laptop has some "wiretapping" info on it. Not necessarily the stuff they were looking for but possibly proof that it happened...

              That's the scary thing, the masses are like, pft you are paranoid if you think Democrats are part of some big pedo ring. But the moment it's a Republican they think "That fucker has to be a pedo." And yet they are so stupid to be unable to realize how idiotic their bias is.

              I'm of the mentality that both sides can be equally guilty of the act and until there is proof otherwise I will take the information with a grain of salt but I won't outright ignored the information we've seen and blow it off as a lie because it's shown to have a rather convincing argument to suggest that it might be real. I say might because it's a situation you don't want to be real, taht it's one big setup of trolling because the idea that people would do something this disgusting under our noses, it would be anarchy.

            Alright this is just a theory but, what if they fabricated this with a false leak on the Clintons to minimize damage and get it out first since the one we've been waiting for hasn't dropped yet.  So then when the real leak drops it will be drowned out by the noise of this fake one, and when people do get exposed to the real leak they'll be too confused to figure out what's real or fake.
           </p>
           <p>
            Basically, plead guilty to a lesser leak that's still somewhat damaging but not burn-down-the-house damaging, then when the real bombshell leak comes out tear it down as fake news and say the first fake leak was the real leak.

              It would explain the "fake news", and some saying that the US is trying to discredit Wikileaks as of late, all tools to setup the stage for this big payoff.
             </p>
             <p>
              If people are primed for it, they can push some narrative that makes Wikileaks look unreliable or compromised, pull the "Clinton is a victim" card which they did with the original PG, then talk people's head off over TV and the internet with all the facts and details of the fake misinformation, while the people pushing the real leak red-pills look like some "alt-right trolls" or "crackpot conspiracy theorists".
             </p>
             <p>
              It's honestly a risky, shoddy plan IMO, but unfortunately I think it might just work, barely.  From what I've seen so far there is a lot of kool-aid drinkers in the United States, and they are all too willing to reject alternative information and be told what to think.

             A good possibility there. If I was on the other side I'd definitely try to flag Trump for example with the Catholic Church pedogate.

            Maybe they doctored up what is on the laptop?  Put what they wanted on it.  Don't know much about that stuff, but I don't trust Obama, CIA or Clinton and the whole Cabal.  They have tried a couple things now and not much came of it, this might be a larger attempt.  Yes.  I agree a larger false flag.  Something that may scare or threaten Trump.

              They will stop at nothing.  They are not used to losing.  Well, secretly I have been hoping that someone stole it to hand it over to Wikileaks.  But I think it is all too fishy as well.

            According to the BBC article, "Secret Service "lapel assignment pins" for President Donald Trump, the Clinton campaign and the United Nations General Assembly were also taken with the laptop, according to US media."
           </p>
           <p>
            I am most alarmed by this detail, as having a Trump SS pin would provide cover for a bad actor to gain access to the president.

            The laptop was reported to not have classified info but access to the SS sever that does, so if the thief can crack encryption he can maybe access Trump's floor plans and Clinton's emails, this info feels off kilter

            It's suspicious. We need to ask: if it was ligit stolen, why would they run to the press and spread the story? Wouldn't they want to save there own asses? And why would they tell the press there was classified info on it, with specifics?
           </p>
           <p>
            Another scenario, which is unlikely is the secret service leaked it on purpose and set the whole thing up to have a theif leak the info so they were not guilty. But I doubt this is the case.
           </p>
           <p>
            The third scenario, similar to Trump administration planting his tax documents in the hands of a journalist, is this another gift of a) the false flag variety b) or dirt on HRC that could get the ball rolling with the investigation?
           </p>
           <p>
            I guess we won't know till we know more.

             MSM would not spread dirt on Hillary quite yet, someone must catch her first before main stream u-turns their van, so scenario 3b unlikely. What do you mean by 3a "gift of the false flag variety"?

            No doubt the news will want to make something negative of it.  But if it were done intentionally by the Trump administration..left there on purpose like one of those bait bikes or bait cars ... then it could do a lot of things....like identify who doing the stealing if tracking were put on it, and/or was filled with info that they wanted to be made public...to name a few.   If it were plans on Secret Service evacuation procedures, maybe its in light of perceived plans for assassination and meant to throw the assassins off/set them up for capture.

             I like your thinking.  I am hoping for one of your versions The tracking is a great idea and a joke on them for sure.  So as with the assassination bit.  Maybe this is something from Trump, a payback for the selfies with his Grandson?
