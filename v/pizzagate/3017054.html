</blockquote>
<p>Well, I remembered that Ricky Dearman still has a company called Lighthouse Media Group and wondered if there were any connections between the two Lighthouse companies.  That led to a number of interesting discoveries but I\'ll focus on just one in this post... So, looking at the directors of Lighthouse Capital Investments again  (<a href="https://beta.companieshouse.gov.uk/company/08114691/filing-history">https://beta.companieshouse.gov.uk/company/08114691/filing-history</a>) caused me to refocus on <strong>Essence Media</strong> (for a number of reasons).. </p>
<p><a href="http://www.team-essence.com/the-team/">http://www.team-essence.com/the-team/</a></p>
<p>So, here\'s a bit of Bennett\'s bio:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>At 35 years old, Mathew Bennett’s CV looks like he’s picked random careers out of a hat. Having joined the <strong>Military Police</strong> at 18, Mathew has gone on to study a combined honours degree in Social Sciences, worked as  <strong>security contractor in Iraq</strong>, been a sales trader in financial markets in <strong>London and Monaco</strong>.  During this random collision of careers Mathew volunteered as a <strong>mentor at a children’s care home</strong> which inspired him to at invest in a pilot project creating a unique sports and activity provisions for young people in care.  
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>No Matthew, doesn\'t look random to me at all.</p>
<p>Then there\'s the bio for <strong>Oliver Bailey:</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Oliver Bailey grew up in the seedy environs of Camden Town in North London – the farthest place from an ocean on the planet. After moving to Bath and then Manchester to study philosophy, Oliver travelled across the US and lived in Sydney briefly, before returning to London and working in creative advertising, reality TV and film production, while <strong>moonlighting as head of security at some of London’s most renowned music venues</strong>. Oliver then began a career in finance and <strong>currently works for a Swiss private bank in Belgravia</strong> and has recently founded an agri-technology project that is seeking to offer production and processing solutions to the coming global protein crisis. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Private Swiss Bank you say? Which one, I wondered..</p>
<p>Turns out its <strong>Mirabaud</strong> <a href="https://imgur.com/a/RwoRPtC">https://imgur.com/a/RwoRPtC</a>  and oh look, Oliver is a patron of the <strong>NSPCC</strong></p>

               <p>
                A specialist educator at the Association Action Educative (AAE) in Dunkerque, Philippe Toulouse revealed at the end of 2012 the existence of a parallel accounting system for the benefit of the main leaders of the association and to the detriment of the homeless and children. mistreated. 
Harassment, threats, searches, Philippe Toulouse puts on the public square all the pressures that it undergoes, that they are professional, police, legal or political, while continuing to fight for the departure of the corrupt leaders and for the maintenance of the missions from the Association. 
A fight still relevant because the former officials in question are still not summoned by the courts.
