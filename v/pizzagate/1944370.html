            I don't think pedophile catchers are entrapping "innocent" people.. i don't know any adult who is online trying the befriend teens, and those who are, are clearly looking for something they should not be looking for..

            Bhahaha, one of my math professors once derided sociology and psychology.. as "pseudo-science"
Sociology is complete liberal garbage, a subjective pseudo-science, based in personal observations, not on hard facts or statistics.
I had a libtard /. leftie GF who has  a masters in sociology and i used to read some of the papers she was studying, just for kicks, and i used to laugh at how seriously the garbage she was studying used to take itself.. the density of the language.. pure and complete verbose garbage.
Only delusional lefties and their kind take "sociology" seriously, along other garbage like "gender studies" , etc
           </p>
           <p>
            Psychology and specially "psychoanalisis" also started as a pseudo-sciences, with, but fortunately with time, some psy fields like behavioral psychology that use observation and the scientific method to prove theories, were developed.... but it is too late as psychology has pretty much been superseded and made obsolete, as a real science, by neuroscience. I do have a few papers and books by Daniel Kahneman and Richard H. Thaler, who are the fathers of behavioural economics.
           </p>
           <p>
            I don't live by any "book", that is completely silly.. this is what i have intelligence for, to analyze, to use the scientific method, mathematics, statistics and other hard sciences  to understand how the world works.
           </p>
           <p>
            Have you ever studied any ethics? I have, as an undergrad.
           </p>
           <p>
            Since the Kanadian marxist state cannot protect children because it is too busy promoting its own libtard agenda and restricting freedom of speech, it is just natural the Kanadian citizens are taking the law in their own hands. That is the right and the ETHICAL thing to do.
This is not paranoia, this is the reaction of society to a failed, corrupt, failed, socialist government.

           <p>
            This supports the point i am making. Those adults who are looking to "befriend" children, are doing it for a reason.. to groom them, to befriend them, and then to abuse them. This is not paranoia, this is reality, proven by facts and statistics.
           </p>
           <p>
            This modus operandi, is used by jewish pedophiles in Hollywood, by pedophile priests in the catholic church etc.

            You are right, it isn't a crime, but i have yet to meet a grown man or woman who looks for teenagers to meet and "talk"
           </p>
           <p>
            Normal adults meet with people around their age to befriend.
No matter what you say, the only adults that actively seek to "hang out" and "meet" with young teenagers are PEDOPHILES, and this can be confirmed by the big quantity of teachers and other people who work around children that abuse them.
           </p>
           <p>
            I am not saying that all teachers and people who work around children are pedos, but history proves that some of them are.
and.. grown adults who actively seek on the internet the company of children for whatever purpose are definitely sick pedophiles.
           </p>
           <p>
            Pedophiles are the lowest type of human scum there is.. they are not even safe in jail, as it is common knowledge that most of them get executed
by other criminals while incarcerated, because even assassins and drug dealers know that pedos are worhless scum.

           <p>
            Thank you for question.
           </p>
           <p>
            I don't think Pedophile catchers should be given "carte Blanche" to do whatever they want, but they should not be banned, as the documentary implies at the end.
           </p>
           <p>
            I think the big problem in places like Canada, is that people have lost a sense of community, specially in big cities; and they expect the government or the police to protect children and this is obviously not working. As a matter of fact, in the US, CPS seems to be doing children more harm than good.
Watch this video to learn more:
           </p>
           <p>
            <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgRwZGDAKhU">
             https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgRwZGDAKhU
            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            This documentary makes a point to defend pedophiles, by impling that a  40 year old guy for example, is not committing any crime by just seeking out to talk and to meet  a 14 year old girl or boy. That is true, but c'mon.. let's not kid ourselves any guy that age that is looking to talk or to meet a young teenager has other intentions in mind.
           </p>
           <p>
            Pedophile catchers are basically doing community service; they are stopping and shaming pedophiles and i don't see anything wrong with this.
So what if they want ratings?..  as i said in the video.. the TV channel, the police officers, etc.. they all make money, don't they?, so 
why are they so against the vigilantes making any money to cover their expenses, as long as they are providing the community  a service.?
           </p>
           <p>
            If the let pedophiles do whatever they want and we let them prey on kids anytime, anywhere, we have the situation we are in.
At least if they know they are being watched by vigilantes, they will probably curb their behaviour. or stop all together.
