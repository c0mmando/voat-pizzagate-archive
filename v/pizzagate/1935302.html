<p>IMO, the Deep State is trying to convince us that we are on the verge of civil war. They need events that enfuriate us.

Ask yourself, in the unlikely event that the DNC sent a pizza under such circumstances, why would this be a stand alone article instead of minor facts in the main storyline? To inflame us will be the answer.  But are you sure you know why they would want to do that? Just for kicks because they have the power. I doubt it.</p>
<p>IMO, they need an excuse to impose at least a brief martial law, so they can enact emergcy measures and laws, that they otherwise would not be able to pass, and haven\'t been able to pass. Gun control. If they can fabricate a staged civil outburst, or are fortunate enough to inspire one, they can then spring to action and have a plausable reason why they did so.</p>
<p>Remember Rosie Odonnel saying we need Martial Lar after Trump innnauguration? We know who Hollywood celebrities are beholden to. <a href="http://www.breitbart.com/big-hollywood/2017/01/12/rosie-odonnell-calls-martial-law-delay-trump-inauguration/">http://www.breitbart.com/big-hollywood/2017/01/12/rosie-odonnell-calls-martial-law-delay-trump-inauguration/</a></p>
<p>And look how on june 6th, The Daily Informer ran an article about the pros and cons of Martial Law, including a scnario they pitch where it might be justified and a good idea.  <a href="http://www.mydailyinformer.com/what-would-happen-if-martial-law-would-happen-in-the-america/">http://www.mydailyinformer.com/what-would-happen-if-martial-law-would-happen-in-the-america/</a></p>

<p>And in January of this year, WND ran an article about how after taking a video pole about Rosie Odonnell\'s comments, they were shocked how many backed Martial Law and the removal of Trump.  <a href="http://cc.bingj.com/cache.aspx?q=hollywood+we+need+martial+law&amp;d=5044823004021819&amp;mkt=en-US&amp;setlang=en-US&amp;w=U3Q7LDKuOIH2HrZsqyg1URujenUFLgbh">http://cc.bingj.com/cache.aspx?q=hollywood+we+need+martial+law&amp;d=5044823004021819&amp;mkt=en-US&amp;setlang=en-US&amp;w=U3Q7LDKuOIH2HrZsqyg1URujenUFLgbh</a></p>
<p>If they can have inspire civil unrest, or manufacture it, that is their green light and casus belli to impose even a brief martiql law, which they can accomplish what they otherwise have failed to do under normal circumstances, seize the guns for good. At least usefull assault rifel\'s. Hence the hoax events have to involve high profile shootings of politicians, children in school, or, if they get desperate, even a fake shooting of the Potus. </p>
<p>We know Sandy Hook, Orlando nightclub, Santa Barbara, Aurora theater shooting, Comet Ping Pong shooting(used more to blame tin foil researchers as unstable)  and several other events were staged hoaxes in an attempt to make a case for gun control, with other agendas thrown in. With our economy teetering, the stock market 100% rigged, Precious metal market 100% supressed with impunity to protect the dying fiat currency, and the explosion of bitcoin, they must be in an increasing hurry to dissarm the public. The growth of those joing the truth community is another problem as well. </p>

            descent analysis.  yeah def not buying that the dude was just an old angry dem angle.  it's definitely aimed at getting citizenry scared and divided (shooting at "elected" officials on a baseball field- the 'national pastime').  good point about the angering "awoke" people with the pizza quote.  i too suspect ties leading to deep state (and then on to intl userers/zionists who want to weaken, disarm, degrade and control the common folk)

            This is an interesting theory, but there are two violations of Rule 2 (please fix them):

           <blockquote>
            <p>
             We know Sandy Hook, Orlando nightclub, Santa Barbara, Aurora theater shooting, Comet Ping Pong shooting(used more to blame tin foil researchers as unstable) and several other events were staged hoaxes
            </p>
           </blockquote>
           <p>
            Many of us
            <em>
             suspect
            </em>
            the Comet shooting was a false flag, but not everyone here believes each one of these was a hoax or false flag.  Please rephrase to show this is your opinion.
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             And on june 8, Daily Kos ran an article that speculated what components would be needed for a successfull Trump removal, one of which was Martial Law.

            </p>
           </blockquote>
           <p>
            The article is actually listing martial law as something that
            <em>
             Trump
            </em>
            might do.  That is, they are fearmongering to support the idea that he should be removed from office.  Please correct this.

             I figured you would show up. You were meant to protest this thread. No. I will not rephrase what I said. Because the "We know" was never including you. For instance, you don't believe in PG. YOU are never being spoken to when I am talking. YOU, can disrupt however. Do your thang.Your second point was made by your fellow shill/disninfo friend.  Figured you would latch onto anything you could latch onto. Soo...yeah,.

              I'm not "latching onto" anything.  I actually find your theory somewhat interesting/compelling, and I wanted to give you a chance to correct your errors before removing the post.

           <p>
            This is not true.  That article discusses martial law in the context not of a Trump being removed, but Trump performing a coup.   That is Trump declaring himself a dictator not a President.

             Good point AreWeSure. It is warning we should be concerned that Trump might become a dictator. "What Will You Do If Trump Tries a Coup?". Ain't that special?

             1K times Thank You!  Yes Yes Yes!!! We must have a Peaceful Revolution.  They want us to fight.  They want a Civil War.  They have Militarized the PDs and many cities have tanks that will be rolled out to kill the Truthers.  You will not see that on TV for the MSM will be hiding their lies and the numbers killed.   We must UNITE and not let them divide us. That is playing right into their hands.  Mark my words there will be more situations like this to rile us up and to divide us.  Do not let them.

            It has also been discovered that the shooter was not a Bernie Guy.  No.  It was announced by Clinton News Network that he was.  My local news announced this morning that he never even volunteered in his own state, Ill.  Hmm. Also I received a notice this morning from another member that it was also discovered by a Truth Researcher on here that he was a Hillary supporter.  This whole story was a big lie concocted again by the Deep State to get away with another Fake Event.  This guy imo, was MK Ultra and was set to go off at some point.  They waited and when Scalise came out with that Tweet, they new they had their moment.  Lies Lies Lies, that is something they are good at.

             That's because he volunteered in the more important state of Iowa.  Here's an interview with someone who also a volunteer.

            <blockquote>
             <p>
              Charles Orear, 50, a restaurant manager from St. Louis, said in an interview Wednesday that he became friendly with James T. Hodgkinson, whom law enforcement officials identified as the shooter, during their work in Iowa on Sen. Bernie Sanders’s presidential campaign. Orear said Hodgkinson was a passionate progressive and showed no signs of violence or malice toward others.
             </p>
             <p>
              “You’ve got to be kidding me,” Orear said when told by phone. “I met him on the Bernie trail in Iowa, worked with him in the Quad Cities area.”

             Here's a quote from the Sanders campaign.

            <blockquote>
             <p>
              Josh Miller-Lewis, Sanders' deputy communications director, said Hodgkinson signed up to host a Democratic primary debate watch party and registered in advance to attend three more volunteer events.

              SHUT UP.  You are working for the LIARS.  All I know is what I heard and I am not a LIAR.  He is not on record to even have volunteered in his own state.  ASo he traveled all the way to Iowa but nothing in his own state. Who is Orear?  O-Rear.  Easily manufactured.  You have done nothing but try to spread lies and CTR on this site.  You have a bad track record.

               I think you only act like this when you know you are wrong.  I don't work for anybody.  You just made a claim.  I say that claim is false and I presented you with evidence that shows your claim is false.   Instead of engaging that evidence you
              </p>
              <p>
               A.  Ignore the evidence from Bernie's own campaign that he volunteered in Iowa
B.  Attack me as a liar.
C.  Produce evidence from a different state which doesn't contradict point A.
D.  Dismiss an eyewitness account by jumping to a conspiracy with no evidence.
              </p>
              <p>
               Now that an official from the Bernie Sanders campaign has confirmed his involvement with the campaign, what is your basis for saying he wasn't for Bernie? Do you think I made that up?
How do you know what you "know" is actually true if you refuse to engage in evidence to the contrary?

There is no reason both of these couldn't be true.
He volunteered in Iowa.   True.
He didn't volunteer in Illinois.   True.

                Correct The Record.  An outfit founded by David Brock the former BF of James Alefantis.  They come on here as they did on reddit (trying to kill truths about Bernie) and twist our comments to make normies or new members believe their lies.  Twisting or just plain lying is their job.  They now have paid shills from ShareBlue as well on here.

              and I knew it was true having just heard it on my local news as well, minus the CNN part.  They are all about dividing us.  Don't fall for it.  Beware, they will keep it up.

             Well, that depends. Was the Rep shot in the first place, or is he in on it? Remember, the entire government knows we did 9/11 along with Mossad, they all lie about it or talk vague about needing an investigation. So they are all guilty of treason. I would think the shooting event is more likely a hoax than a false flag, but a false flag is not impossible.

              I agree that it could be either one.  Who knows?  If anyone spills the beans, we will have another false flag/hoax event.  He was also an abuser which I have yet to be seen reported on TV.

            We are on the verge of Civil War. This isn't up for debate. That's what got Trump elected. Read up on American History circa 1855 - 1860. This is almost exactly what it was like. It went on for YEARS like this. Then it got really fucking bad.

            Just because things aren't bad now doesn't mean that will always be the case.

             No.Fail. That is what they are trying to convince us, so we buy their staged event that forces them to declare martial law. And you are pushing it too as expected. We are not on the verge of civil war, Americans couldn't put down their cell phones long enough. Most have not  been red pilled. Your take the postition a shill would take. Just because you can't see us doesn't mean we can't see you. I see you mr shill, nice try.

              On whether we're on the verge of a Civil War yes. I totally agree. But DeathTooMasons not everyone has the same opinion. Wouldn't that be bad if we all agreed 100%?

              you'll find most of my opinions are the opposite of what a shill would say.

            I thought it seemed like an odd shooting as well. CNN (I know, I know) reports that some of the people involved were supposed to be meeting to discuss gun legislature, but in light of the shooting, the meeting was postponed

             Yes,  and the UPS shooter used an "assault pistol " That is the very first time I've heard that expression. I've owned hunting rifles and a  handgun but I did support  a ban on military  assault weapons with large capacity magazines. However if gun opposition is going to start  including pistols I might have to re-think  my position.

             Just shut your stupid child-raping mouth, toothless Robert.
This isn't even about PG.

               Well, everything is connected politically one way or the other, but this isn't directly about the PG happenings, but the greater fight to control us using violent means.
