<p>1) Number one tipoff: ASKING FOR MONEY. They always want to monetize the operation, like they did with the fundraising pages for the fake shooting at Sandy Hook, Boston Marathon, and other false flags perpetrated by satanist pedo jews.What the hell do you need money for to march in the street?</p>
<p>2) Having &quot;debates&quot;. What is there to debate? What do you hope to accomplish with an idiotic &quot;debate&quot; in the context of a &quot;demonstration&quot;. A &quot;demonstration&quot; of what? Just more waste of time nonsense, just like &quot;occupy wall street&quot;, where a bunch of dummies hang around in a park and clap their hands and chant like kindergartners. What did that accomplish? Is Wall St. no longer corrupt now? No, but a bunch of angry people who lost all their retirement funds in the 2008 crash have been placated, which was George Soros\' intent in staging the waste of time &quot;demonstration&quot; in the first place, and to draw out, divert and document names and faces that might be a threat to Wall Street criminals such as the event\'s sponsor George Soros. </p>
<p>3) Satanic masonic rainbow-flag colored graphics with &quot;heart&quot; shapes (actually ancient Roman prostitute symbol that satanic masons use for &quot;love&quot;, i.e., their definition of it). Also, the professional graphics and typeface design are EXPENSIVE to produce. Someone was HIRED to make the stupid looking font of the stupid &quot;#allchildrenmatter&quot; thing, and the wording is straight out of a Soros organization. I don\'t need you to tell me or anyone else that &quot;all children matter&quot;. Everyone knows that, so why are you stating the obvious in the same way Soros pays for &quot;black lives matter&quot;. No one said they didn\'t matter. No one said that some children matter but not others. So why are you making a stupid pointless slogan like this?</p>
<p>4) Posted on Facebook, so when you comment or &quot;like&quot; the page, the jew shills have all your contacts, name, photo, browsing history, chat conversations, etc. since JewBook saves all that and never deletes ANY of it, EVER. (in fact these presumptuous jew satanists claim to OWN all the content you post there).</p>
<p>5) The guy sponsoring this event is named Wolfe. Jew name. </p>
<p>A far more effective course of action would be to form small paramilitary units and quietly start assassinating the jew satanist pedos behind pizzgate (not sure if the Pedostas are jews, but they should still be put to death.)</p>
<p>But whether you agree with that tactic or not, this thing is a total honey pot. I hope you are not suckered by these satanist jew asswipes. This is just like &quot;occupy wall street&quot; and other total waste of time nonsense sponsored by the jews responsible for the crimes in the first place. A bunch of suckers will go out, march around, clap their hands, and chant idiotic slogans, and just like other Soros &quot;demonstrations&quot; absolutely nothing will result from it. PLEASE don\'t send these obvious jew shills a PENNY of your money. It doesn\'t cost ANYTHING to march in the street. But I guarantee this is a jew honey pot operation to gather data on people likely to take action against jew pedos like themselves. All the signs are there.</p>',

            You discredit your argument by going off on jews, I find myself saying this a lot, but Jews are clearly involved in the big picture here but labeling everyone in your argument as Satanist Jews just takes away from you narrative, which I actually agree with, in that protests are stupid and will clearly discredit the investigation.

            I am not saying that it is or is not whatever they are saying here but I am saying that didn't everyone agree that staying away from the anything "lives matter" narrative was smart as it is considered racist and triggering for negativity? That is the only red flag I see.

            That's what you sound like OP.
You aren't helping anything.
You ever hear of poisoning the well? That's what you're doing.
I agree that demonstrations are pointless but being that austically anti-jewish is only going to push good people away.

            1) Money can buy advertisements. Advertisements will help get a bigger head count. The bigger the head count, the more effect the demonstration has.
           </p>
           <p>
            2) Organized debates present the evidence and shows people that we are using logical conjecture and  that we arent  tinfoil mad hatters.

            Exactly. This post is nothing but Jew rhetoric with little to no logic on how a PG protest will benefit elite pedophiles more than it harms them. Masses of people = Attention. Attention is exactly what this movement needs

            Nah, we got to win this one in the eye's of the public.  That means trials, not summary executions/assassinations.
           </p>
           <p>
            We need a massive Truth &amp; Reconciliation meeting, where the public is basically informed of EVERYTHING the gov't (intel agencies included) lied about.  Which is damn near everything for the last 60+ years!
           </p>
           <p>
            After the public starts to clue in, we go after the financial system, primarily usury, fiat currency, and the current banking 'model' of fractional reserve banking (this gives private aka Wall St banks the ability to create NEW MONEY out of thin air).

             I think it means summary executions of John and Tony Podesta. I can't stand that this planet has two sick fucking pieces of shit like that living on it, and I need this situation to change, and clapping hands and singing stupid songs is not going to do that. Bullets in their maggot pig skulls will.

             Yeah, well, you get on that. I'm sure you will end the fed and usury and change our currency by holding signs and chanting childish slogans. Once these Fed Reserve people hear how you chant like you really really mean it, they will end the Fed voluntarily, lol

            NO!!! A crowd of people holding signs demanding investigation does not in any way, shape or form benefit TPTB. Witnesses and news coverage raise awareness, even if it's coverage in a negative light. Crowds of people show people that this is an important issue! It gets people googling what is pizzagate! If people are taking time to organize, people will think maybe this theory isn't "debunked"and prompts people to look intothe evidence for them selves!!

             Yeah, it worked great for the other Soros "demonstration" "occupy wall street". After people googled wall street, went out in crowds into the streets, held up signs and clapped their hands while chanting pointless slogans, now Wall Street is all cleaned up and its not corrupt anymore. You're right, these are really effective tactics lol

              So that protest wasn't a huge success so we should never try again? 1. Wall Street corruption isn't anything new. PG is!! There is a reason they are censoring us. They don't want people to know about pizzagate. People holding signs about something they haven't heard of sparks curiosity.

             Oh, you mean the theosophist Thule society member satanist socialist Adolph "hitler" Schicklegruber Rothschild, the founder of Israel. No, I've never seen that documentary. Maybe you should look up the documentary about the people who financed him, like Warburg and the other Wall Street jews.

              "Britain governed this area under a League of Nations mandate from 1920 to 1948. To the Arab population who lived there, it was their homeland and had been promised to them by the Allies for help in defeating the Turks by theMcMahon Agreement – though the British claimed the agreement gave no such promise.
             </p>
             <p>
              The same area of land had also been promised to the Jews (as they had interpreted it) in the Balfour Declaration and after 1920, many Jews migrated to the area and lived with the far more numerous Arabs there. At this time, the area was ruled by the British and both Arabs and Jews appeared to live together in some form of harmony in the sense that both tolerated then existence of the other. There were problems in 1921 but between that year and 1928/29, the situation stabilised."
