            From the linked Daily Mail article:
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             Miss Akhtar, who
             <strong>
              still lives with her father
             </strong>
             in the South Yorkshire town,
             <strong>
              joined Rise after his resignation
             </strong>
             ...
            </p>
           </blockquote>
           <p>
            Right there is a clue.  It does seem very likely that TPTB in Rotherham pedo circles arranged her hire at RISE in order to maintain access.
