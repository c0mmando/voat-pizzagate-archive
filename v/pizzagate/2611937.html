             It's ok. We're going to hang all of you pedophiles. Right in Times Square. Right under The Eiffel Tower and London Bridge and in front of the Capitol building and White House. Your bodies will hang under the Seattle Needle and under the streetlights. The Statue of Liberty will be adorned with your corpses in nooses as we spit on your fucking pedophile bodies. Our cities will be filled with your dead bodies hanging as a lesson for all to see pedophile filth.

                 It's ok. We're going to hang all of you pedophiles. Right in Times Square. Right under The Eiffel Tower  and London Bridge and in front of the Capitol building and White House. Your bodies will hang under the Seattle Needle and under the streetlights. The Statue of Liberty will be adorned with your corpses in nooses as we spit on your fucking pedophile bodies. Our cities will be filled with your dead bodies hanging as a lesson for all to see pedophile filth.

            My closest friend admitted to me a few days ago his stepfather had molested him through childhood. Told me I'm sorry I never told you I never even told my mom. My best friend of ten years who we have been there through thick and thin. Rather that be laughing over some dumb inside jokes or gaming for hours or him and I' s girlfriend hanging with us or friends we grew up with. I literally feel like weeping. I feel like I've failed him. I wish every pedophile death. I wish them torture. I wish I could kill his old stepfather now and murder that motherfucker. I don't even know what to think I feel in horror. I asked him what about losing his virginity in high school with an ex we knew and he told that was the first time consensual and with a girl. I literally don't know what to think and have seeped over this. I keep asking him why he never told me and he says he didn't want me to see him differently and says he knows the irony since he knows I'm a long time Pizzagate researcher. I feel sick :(

             , he trusts you, this is why he told you. Look, he didn't even tell his mom. You haven't failed. Maybe he wanted you to see him as an intact person, and it must have meant very much to him that you have been his friend all these years.
            </p>
            <p>
             Anger, and grief and desperation are an adequate reaction on your side. This will deepen your friendship even more. Be there for him when he wants to talk, or needs help with going to police, or talking to his mom. He will tell you what he might need.

              Trying to be, he cried to me over this and it truly horrified my soul. One of the things that has bothered me now the last few weeks. Not easy hearing a close friend of ten years has a horrific childhood. Thanks man, it means alot. We have to keep on fighting this nightmare, we're the only ones doing it.

             Thank you for being his friend! I'm glad that he felt that he could share that with you, because it really does help to talk about it. I was a victim of childhood sexual abuse from age 5-12 by my uncle. I told my mom when i was 13, and she called me a liar but then tried to convince me that it was really my dad doing it and that I was just blaming my uncle to cover for my dad, then she never said anything else about it. About 10 years later i was able to convince my uncle to confess to my mom himself. So he did.. she didnt say a word to me until 2 years later when i told her again (i didnt know my uncle had gone through with his confession).. she said she had no idea, and my stepdad said "so what, who cares"... these are people who pass themselves off as devout baptist Christian's and my grandmother is the type that reads her bible all the way through several times a year and is a fixture at her church.. all she said was that I should "forgive him"... then they all kicked me out of my family and are standing by my uncle.. my mom told my little brothers and sisters that "it wasnt my uncles fault, and that I was a very promiscuous kid growing up".. and they send my little brothers and sisters to go stay with him for 2 weeks every summer... they haven't even let me see my siblings in over a year... my brother is the only one allowed to talk to me, because he is 19 and an adult.. so much faith in humanity has been lost.. I am just holding out hope that all of this pizzagate trash will come out and there will be a "revolution" against child sexual abuse... but I agree.. they should all hang!

              Wow I’m so sorry this happened to you. I very strongly suspect that your uncle, who molested you growing up, also molested your mother when she was growing up and she has not come to terms with that even now. I say that because she tried hard to convince you it was your father and not your uncle, which was false. This makes no sense to a rational person but she is trying to justify it in her own mind. She is in deep denial and it’s disturbing she is sending your brothers and sisters to stay with this monster for weeks at a time. None of this is your fault so please do not blame yourself. Your family is deeply troubled and is hiding under the guise of religion to be seen as virtuous people when your grandmother, mother and uncle all know what’s going on. Can you get any kind of help in processing your feelings about all this? You seem very level headed and know what’s going on but the emotional aspect of this from your entire family and how they are outcasting you is what is deeply troubling. You are not the villain. Thank you for being here with us. I hope u stay.
             </p>
             <p>
              I wish u a lifetime of peace and fulfillment with good, loving people in your life: friends, coworkers, neighbors, significant other and children in your future however you choose to live your life, you deserve it.

              First of all, I'm so sorry! Secondly, your family are awful people! From what you wrote I would suspect that you are not the first in your family to experience sexual abuse! Your mom and grandmas reaction is abnormal and likely a result of having experienced it themselves or at the very least having prior knowledge of your sick uncles behaviors! It's easier for many to suppress it than have to face it. You are stronger than all of them! Please don't let how they handled this be a reflection on real Christians! I am a baptist and no way in hell would I or any of my baptist friends condone or excuse such despicable behavior!

             Know how you feel. Know a woman who was double raped by an abusive boyfriend and his brother when she was 15. Took her years to be able to trust straight men as a whole (I was the sole exception).

             The fact he told you is high praise for you, gamepwn. It means he respects you and trusts your relationship. I had a very close friend who was molested for years by a neighbor from the age of 5. She grew up, put herself through school, including an internship at the BBC, became a TV news producer, had kids...then it all hit the fan. Having her own kids brought it all back. She ended up with major depression, which she beat, and then a brain tumor, which she did not. As I was driving her home from visiting her oldest child in college to break the news she was dying of brain tumor, she told me she was terrified she would go to Hell because she couldn't feel forgiveness the way the Bible teaches. I damn near drove off the highway. I felt that same rage you are describing.
            </p>
            <p>
             I took a few deep breaths. Consulted my inner compass. Then I pointed out that a) Fuck that guy. Anger is the normal response of Good towards Evil and b) forgiveness is a decision, an act of will, not an emotion, and she clearly
             <em>
              willed
             </em>
             the Good. (In fact, willing a Good you do not desire is far more meritorious than willing what you long for.) God, who allowed all of it to happen, could sort out the details.
            </p>
            <p>
             The look of peace I saw wash over the side of her face that wasn't paralyzed by the brain tumor was gratifying to behold.
            </p>
            <p>
             I'm glad your friend has you to confide in. Perhaps this was why you were called to this PG work all along. :-)

              I know it breaks the soul of someone. It's not just in that moment but for their whole life. My best fri I'm so sorry that happened to your friend. Forgiveness can be for many things but I have no forgiveness for child rapist. If in a war a soldier was ordered to fire into a crowd and killed  and begged for forgiveness and regret I would forgive them over that of a child rapist. Pedophiles are a different kind of evil. Look at a child imagine your own childhood. Children are innocent. They don't see or comprehend the world life we do. They are not corrupted with nihilism yet like most of us have. To do something so horrifically evil to a child that you break them you do not deserve forgiveness. Your a good friend Vindicator, and a great mod. You've helped keep this forum afloat through the best and worst. Keep on fighting the good fight. We got to stop this and save or worlds children.

              Im so sorry vindicator! She was not wrong to feel anger over what happened to her and you were absolutely right! If she is a believer she will be in heaven where all of her pain from this world will be wiped away.  Anger is not wrong when it is justified. In her case it's undoubtedly justified. Also, God is angry at evil. God is sinless yet he experiences and expresses anger so it's not wrong!

             sorry sweetheart. Awful. Glad he said something out loud instead of continuing in pain and silence. 
Glad you were there &amp; informed enough not to “view him differently” 
know it’s bad for women too, but I don’t have to give up gender norms to admit something happened to me.
Thanks for being there and listening. Means a lot when people listen and believe you w/o judging. ❤️

            . I just saw an article in the Australian Financial Review tltled "#MAYBE NOT ME-With its tight focus on the
            <strong>
             bad boys
            </strong>
            of entertainment, the mass movement against sexual harassment is dividing feminists and missing the deeper issues of gender equality" Author Felicity Chaplin. (
            <strong>
             Emphasis mine
            </strong>
            )
           </p>
           <p>
            REALY???? "Bad Boys"???? Considering the pics are of Child sodomiser Roman Polanski, Child rapist Woody Allen and threats of violence through contractors Weinstein?? Gender inequality??? Two child rapists in the pics, and this fool is commenting on gender inequality? Get the F*&amp;^ out of here! More pedo downplay while still having the details in your face. SICKENING.
