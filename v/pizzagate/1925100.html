            Yes i recall this. The twitter post was pretty damning that something sinister was going on against him. Then  'commit suicide' 2 wks later??. How much circumstantial evidence do law enforcement actually need -  Oh thats right they are corrupt and implicated...

            Fresno PD first reported that Mr. Lang had stab wounds to abdomen and upper back. Then the story changed: "three superficial, self-inflicted stab wounds to his chest and no cuts on his back"

            . Then the official coroner's report: 3 stab wounds to sternum, two perforating the sternum with one wound passing through the front wall of the heart and the 3rd wound entering but not perforating sternum.Negative drug screen. Conclusion was suicide, death by smoke inhalation with multiple stab wounds.

            CHILD PORN CONNECTION (doing the OP's job here)
           </p>
           <p>
            We are by no means free. If and when the Government targets us, we are completely and utterly done, and there is really nothing we can do about it. Through my example the Government is trying to drive home the point that they want obidient, submisive, and loyal subjects. And they will settle for nothing less..
            <strong>
             <strong>
              I’m also fairly certain I’ve figured out how Fresno Law Enforcement handled the actual access and internet distribution of the offensive material. Let’s just say that the FEDS should re-investigate all Child porn cases in Fresno where ATT Internet Services provided the Internet service. Especially cases where the accused had a conflict with the City Of Fresno or high ranking City of Fresno personnel. Other elements are simply handled by planting various elements of false evidence here and there once they enter a residence. That is why Fresno LE was so determined to get a search warrant for an official home entry in my case. As I’ve mentioned in the past Fresno LE had already illegally and secretly entered by home, copied my hard drives in order to get a good game plan for the eventual false arrest. There also appears to be a pattern here. Anyone who has ever talked publicly about, accused, or discussed Jerry Dyer’s suposed sex scandle with that 16 year old girl has found themselfs in some type of legal peril within a few short years.

            . And with this letter I have for certain signed my death warrant with Fresno LE. Kind Regards, John Lang Fresno Ca 93728
