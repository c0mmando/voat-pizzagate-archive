<blockquote>
<p>This relates to pizzagate because our only hope is to cause action at the highest levels. I again called House Intelligence ranking members Trey Gowdy &amp; Adam Schiff and asked for a on the record statement regarding any investigation into pedogate or the pedophiles that have been identified as working inside the federal government. I asked about the Pakistani ISI Awan brothers Spy Ring who have now fled to Pakistan with stolen government property. I told them to Google it if they are unaware they have been infiltrated:)</p>
<p>I also told them about the Seth Rich story and that it appears to be a murder or cover up and he could be the leaker to Wikileaks. I asked for an on the record statement into his death and investigation of him being the leaker. I also asked why they are spending so much time on Russia and not investigatiog pedogate &amp; corruption in their own members such as HRC &amp; Podestsa taking 35 million from Russian Uranium One deal.</p>
<p>I then called the Whitehouse and spoke live to a person who gives messages to the President at the number listed and said the same thing. Everyone can call. Trust me they are nervous.</p>

<p>The others did as well but were not as panicked. I named names and had them write them down while I was on the phone. The Pakistani ISI Awan brothers infiltration of Democratic IT department, illegal visas from the Whitehouse, no security clearances, access to US classified info, fleeing to Pakistan in February with no one investigating but Capital Police. I asked why Director Comey &amp; deputy director McCabe in charge of counterterroism have not been investigating them when it is a national security issue and that is their number one job to protect us. I asked why they are wasting millions on bogus russia stories about Trump when HRC &amp; Podesta made millions off US Uranium sells to Russia. And when pedophiles are in key places of power in the government and child sex rings are rampant causing citizens to investigate it themselves. It is liberating do it and make them write it down.</p>
