<p>COLUMBUS, Ohio (WSYX/WTTE) — A group of former Ohio State Wrestlers who say they were abused by the team’s doctor, Richard Strauss, is asking the Ohio Inspector General to investigate the school’s connection with Jeffrey Epstein.</p>
<p>The former wrestlers want to know how Ohio State might have been connected to Jeffrey Epstein and are pointing fingers at two of the school\'s biggest donors, Les Wexner and his wife, Abigail.</p>
<p>They are requesting that the inspector general look into if the Wexner’s ever helped Epstein abuse a young woman, Maria Farmer. The Wexner’s said they have no knowledge of the alleged events.</p>
<p>In a five-page letter submitted on Friday, Feb. 7, the wrestlers ask the inspector general to &quot;open an investigation into the allegations that Abigail Wexner helped Jeffrey Epstein sexually assault a young woman named Maria Farmer and <a href="https://abc6onyourside.com/on-your-side/the-connection-between-l-brands-founder-and-financier-jeffrey-epstein">open a second investigation into the relationship between alleged sex trafficker/pedophile Jeffrey Epstein, Wexner</a> and Ohio State University.&quot;</p>
<p><a href="https://abc6onyourside.com/news/local/wexner-spokesperson-says-ties-have-been-severed-with-epstein-for-more-than-a-decade">Farmer filed a lawsuit in July 2019 that alleges Epstein and another woman sexually assaulted her inside of Wexner’s New Albany mansion in the summer of 1996</a>. </p>
<p>The letter from the group of wrestlers said they are turning to the inspector general because of Abigail Wexner\'s status as Vice-Chair of the Board of Trustees at Ohio State.</p>
<p>Given these public allegations against Mrs. Wexner, it is extremely difficult for us to comprehend why OSU maintains its relationship with Abigail Wexner and her family, particularly in light of the history of damning sexual violence issues on campus and those same issues involving the Wexner family and its companies, and both their relationship with the notorious Jeffrey Epstein.</p>
<p>The letter also calls for Ohio State to properly make amends to its victims and to ensure the safety of current and future students.</p>
<p>&quot;We ask that you investigate the &quot;wrongful acts&quot; of Abigail Wexner regarding Maria Farmer. If not you, who else can we turn to?&quot; the letter said.</p>
<p>The wrestlers also asked the investigator general to look into Epstein\'s relationship with Ohio State University.</p>
<p>The letter says Epstein has donated more than $2.5 million to the school while he was under FBI investigation.</p>
<p>&quot;Ohio State has shown that without maximum public pressure, it will turn a blind eye to sexual predators. It ignored the reports of Richard Strauss\' abuse and it is now looking the other way on Jeffrey Epstein and Abigail Wexner. And when the university does acknowledge its role in such abuses, it does not seem to show much moral courage, offering only the pretense of caring in hopes that the problem will just go away and fade from the public conscience,&quot; the letter said.</p>
<p>The letter said Ohio State has engaged in &quot;wrongful acts&quot; by accepting and continuing to hold onto the &quot;ill-begotten&quot; donations from Epstein.</p>
<p>&quot;We love Ohio State, but for us, the current student body, and future students, we ask that you investigate these \'wrongful acts\' done by Abigail Wexner and Ohio State,&quot; the letter concludes.</p>',

            Free speech is not free in pizzagate. See my big red flair? This is what happens in communism just before they kill ya. First they flag ya, and then then they kill ya. Ohhhh pizzagate...I miss the good old days.

             made me a mod, trusted me to lead post-Falcon, and handed the Ownership reins to me when he thought it was best for the board. Kev repeatedly thwarted my efforts, threatened to demod me, and fucked with the mod team I built. As did you. Stop causing drama.

            Is it starting to dawn on you yet that srayzie, the internet sex freak, sent her own pictures to you guys to false flag me, (the anti Q) because I was not pro Q? And blew her self up at the same time. The rest of Goatdom smelled that ploy and they drove her ass out of here. You don't know what I know because I have never told it all and I won't. She is borderline psychotic and she told me that herself. That ain't my fault, thats her fault. I have nothing to do with her past. I hate it for her just like you do, but I didn't cause her bad decisions. Erase that blind spot and things will become a lot clear. She sent her nude pics to at least 3 people on Voat that she herself told me about. I don't think any of those people betrayed her. She did it her own self and I know that. Let it go bro, let it go.....

                Qville is the the place where we publish our findings and let it get blasted to the masses.

              Me and kevdude arranged for you to the owner of this sub. Here you are. You are doing a great job. I could not be more happy with the way you run this sub. You do a great job. Why this tantrum? I have zero complaints with what you do. Why are you throwing a tantrum in the best post you ever made in your whole career?
             </p>
             <p>
              Suggestion:  Throw the self admitted blood drinking argo overboard. He is a whole bag of dead weight. Scratch this post and post it again fresh and hope he don't fuck it up. This was a huge great post and then BOOM here come the blood drinking argosciv to snarl it up.
             </p>
             <p>
              Before its too late click "source", and select all and copy it. I already did it in case you don't catch it fast enough I will give you the entire source code for your post. Your post is massive good and it deserves to be studied without the input and bickering the local blood drinker brought into this.  Peace.

               You and Kev caused more drama on this board than any other users in its history (assuming you are actually two different users, LOL). Neither of you had anything to do with my being here. You are the one shitting up my submission, and I certainly won't delete it and start over when this thread demonstrates perfectly what a duplicitous enemy of pizzagate you are.
              </p>
              <p>
               Wanna prove you're a good guy? Delete all your comments in my thread and leave this subverse. That is what someone who thinks this is a great submission being ruined by drama would do. Someone who is honest.

                 Well, finally the truth comes out. So you and kevdude were the ones who were spamming PG with all that garbage that MF sifted through every day. Overwhelming him to the point that you could then slip a submission in that he made a mistake on, and deleted. All so that Kevdude could demod him.

                       Leave me alone, or would you like me to take this to the boys in sbbh, and tell them how much a jew you act like. I'll tell them everything I can remember. Better still, we'll go to PreviewVoat and discuss it in front of Putt. He'll be able to back up my memory.

                         A White Man, who isn't narcissistic, and doesn't act like a Fiddler on the Roof, would be able to give a girl the last word.

                        <p>
                         Have you ever allowed someone to have the last word? I doubt it.

                         As a matter of fact, whenever anyone says 'women don't belong on the internet, cuz they too emotional.' I always thing to myself, 'Well those faggots ES and argosciv are hella more cry-baby than I am, wtf'

                        <p>
                         So, can you man up and let me have the last word, after i told you to leave me alone, or are you gonna jew-out?

                  As I recall, it was Kev who -- after unleashing Hojuruku and refusing to reban him -- helpfully pointed out the links showing Hojuruku was offering a bounty on Voat and several other platforms on both me and srayzie. It was very confusing at the time, because I was getting
                  <a href="https://searchvoat.co/?st=comments&amp;t=%22%40Vindicator%22&amp;u=Hojuruku&amp;nsfw=on">
                   ping spammed
                  </a>
                  approximately 40 messages per day including harassment from Anon subs and trying to vet Hojuruku's "edits" to his submission. This was just a week or two after Kev had threatened to demod me for not promptly replying to pings in a rule-breaking post, when I went out of town for the weekend to visit a family member with cancer, leaving the new mods in charge. I still don't really get what Hojuruku was trying to accomplish exactly, though he bragged about doxing one of the founding
                  <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/pizzagate">

                  </a>
                  mods somewhere in that OE thread with Donkey. I do know that Kev got srayzie involved in defending me, and in trying to drive off Hojuruku, who I believe is mentally ill and repeatedly doxed himself (the reason Falcon banned him in the first place). Thankfully,

                  put an end to the whole thing by rebanning Hojuruku.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  The whole thing was quite similar to Kev's behavior supporting the shill that was driving people off the board in December 2016: ArmySeer. That's the guy who was banhammering pizzagate researchers and undermining mods from his fake

                  </a>
                  mod, causing them to freak out, attack the mods, and get banned for real. Kev would not allow me to ban AS for multiple rule violations. In fact,

                  </a>
                  . When AS finally gave up after I repeatedly neutered him with linked evidence, he

                  .
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  Kev was a shill. It's a beautiful thing that he screwed up and exposed himself to legal action and had to scrub his account. Probably the same reason ES had to. Cracks me up.

                    Kev was a shill. It's a beautiful thing that he screwed up and exposed himself to legal action and had to scrub his account. Probably the same reason ES had to. Cracks me up.

                   You are delusional as fuck. Before Trump is done he will pass a law making it criminal to be anti-semitic. We are getting distance from that.

                    Kev deleted his virtually invincible account right after he fucked up and
                    <a href="https://files.catbox.moe/jmnhbz.png">
                     admitted publicly that he would post revenge porn on srayzie
                    </a>
                    . Revenge porn is illegal in California, Srayzie's state. Since he also admitted he had it, and someone did indeed send it around to try to damage her, that put him in a dicey position.
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    Since you deleted your account right after he did, and you also admit to having it -- and srayzie can prove to the authorities to whom she sent it privately, when -- logic supports my conclusion. (Assuming you and Kev are indeed different people).
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    In the end, srayzie took you both down. Beautiful!  I assume she could also go after you both legally and collect damages, if she wanted to. As I've said in the past, I would gladly dox myself and testify publicly to everything I witnessed, for the sake of justice.

                     Since the only porn pics i have heard that got heavily circulated were the ones of the guys that sarzy collected, I would imagine that she probably wouldn't want to play that kind of game. There's a lot of people who have seen her as poison for as long as I have, and I'm sure they protected themselves against her sedition, like I did.

                     If I were a guy and had her porn pics sent to me, I'd delete my account, too. That way when the crazy cunt releases her own pornography collection, and accuses some beta slob w/money of 'revenge porn', in order to sue the sucker and his poor family out of existence, the smart ones can say they deleted, before the fact.

                       DMs. I'm afraid that they would be retaliated against, if I told. I am quite disappointed that people don't feel comfortable enough with the mods of PG and GA, to tell them all the crap that witchiepoo pulled. But I understand.

                      So far over the last hundred years, so goes Europe, so goes the United States. I have always watched Europe to see what will happen in the U.S. The European Union and Russia made it a criminal offense to be anti-semitic. I have every reason to believe it will also happen in the U.S.

            Nice work on the butterfly research Vin. Could you answer a question? Could this be mentioned here even though no actual children were involved? I say maybe, because it is like Nexium, which has the same elements.Lawrence Ray charged with running sex cult using daughter ...

             Unfortunately, since there are no minors involved, this falls outside our purview...unless you can connect the dude to players who ARE involved in hurting kids. Then it might be connected. It would depend.

              No minors, "YET." Nexium only had hearsay of such before proof. Then it was allowed because of the connections with Clinton/Bronfmans, ect. I think we are dealing with the same group of people, unless there is the odd chance that this guy was just a random psychopath that used to hang out with a top cop in NYC. Chances of that are slim, in my opinion. We will probably see if I am right in my assumptions. My gut feeling is usually right, and this ain't no Roy Moore/ Kavenaugh case. I have been extra busy, otherwise I would have more.

            Hello...missed

             @Gilderoy
            </a>
            about a network of tunnels and a shuttered international adoption agency in Columbus near the research institute:
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             there are unused underground tunnels close to other places of interest, possibly providing easy, discreet subterranean passage in a chain of child-trafficking locations.
            </p>
            <p>
             How this connection was derived is the result of some twists and turns:
            </p>
            <p>
             It started while NotFBIAnon's mystery photo of the 3 Columbus big shots (the mayor, fire chief, and Columbus school board member) at the Stonewall Columbus Gay Pride Festival last year was being discussed last week on this thread. During the discussion, the recent FBI raid and closing down of an Ohio adoption agency, the European Adoption Consultants in February was brought up.
            </p>
            <p>
             This led to another VOAT thread discussing how a branch of the European Adoption Consultants is located in Columbus a block or so away from the SEIU 1199 HQ in Columbus. In this thread, VOATer

              @HerbVendor
             </a>
             mentioned the proximity of the adoption agency to the Battelle Memorial Institute, the Wexner Medical Center (Jeffrey Epstein managed Leslie Wexner's money until Epstein went to prison) and Ohio State University.

             also disclosed the fascinating information that there is an underground subway (not open to the public) which runs under this particular section of Columbus, OH. He/she related this personal anecdote:
            </p>
            <blockquote>
             <p>
              I know someone who used to service the Battelle facility, when they were in their one day everything started shaking like an earthquake, but were told it was just the trains... OSU campus buildings also have a lot of underground access as well, wouldn't be surprised if there were tunnels too...
             </p>
             <blockquote>
              <blockquote>
               <p>
                On another, semi-related note, apparently there is DISA fusion center in Columbus somewhere too.

            Blue Morpho, if I recall correctly, is a butterfly in the Amazon.  There is an organization down there named Blue Morpho where you can go do ayahuasca!  I looked into it a few years ago and it seemed extremely cultish.
           </p>
           <p>
            Just an aside, but that would be a possible link to mind control given that ayahuasca and LSD both send you into orbit. One may be maleable on ayahuasca as well as on LSD, in line with the CIA experiments of the 50's and 60's.

             Hard to tell if Guiffre has it on her Twitter in hopes people will catch on and investigate, or if she isn't quite a free of Epstein as it appears.

             There's also scopolamine from Colombia, also known as Devil's Breath and hyoscine. A sort of Zombie drug where people have no free will, but do the bidding of their handlers, and also have no memory of what happened to them. It is allegedly used by agencies to induce subjects to engage in horrific acts, such as cannibalism and recording them to compromise them.

              Ug. Apparently, I haven't let my mind wander far enough as to the horrible things this drug could be used for...I imagined lots of things, but somehow skipped the thought of suggestive wickedness for blackmail &amp; being recorded... &lt;shudders&gt; Pretty scary thoughts &amp; ideas, for sure

            Folks, I've been poking around in our archives and editing this to include interesting stuff, and I think we need more diggers, particularly into this National Children's Hospital, it's directors, and the research they are doing on children. The Abigail Wexner Research Institute page says there are
            <a href="https://archive.ph/U8PAY#selection-2657.0-2657.157">
             over 1,000 clinical studies going on
            </a>
            .
           </p>
           <p>
            Who are those scientists? What are they researching? Please help dig!

             , as I recall, you have a background in the field of medical research. Could you skim over the research at the Abigail Wexner Research Institute mentioned above and see if there is anything suspicious we should dig further into? I am wondering if it wasn't Junkermann that lead to Voat's last DDoS outage, but the further buried activities of Abigail Wexner.

              -  I have long questioned the activities associated to biopharma's 'synthetic' claims for their products as the complicated peptides and proteins needed for their production may not be sourced ethically.

              As for the Wexners &amp; their bold efforts to play god while searching for their 'magical' elixirs; I doubt they have high ethical standards for the peptides and proteins sourced for the synthesis and production of their 'synthetic' biopharmaceuticals.  I believe they think they are doing humanity a service and will likely try to exploit this current coronavirus outbreak to expand their R&amp;D efforts.

              "researchers at Nationwide Children’s Hospital have developed a novel synthetic peptide that mimics an essential component of bacterial biofilms. When used as a vaccine, it redirects the natural adaptive immune response to disrupt bacterial biofilms so the immune system and/or traditional antibiotics can now effectively clear the infection"

                   Keep rolling out that tired contortion of context and facts, see how far it gets ya. Your fear is further exemplified by your reliance on that already refuted/debunked talking point regarding blood consumption.

                    nigger, I still have the screen shots of you talking about the glorious wonders of drinking blood. And that you are a dragon, blah blah blah...If I wanted to torment you I would post them to every comment you ever make. Have I done that? NO. That should give you a clue that I am actually sort of proud that you stopped posting satanic music in every thread people post and making an ENORMOUS asshole of yourself.
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    I admit, you have improved a lot. You stopped trashing threads with satanic music and seem to have your mind gathered up better. You used to be a HUGE nuisance. I noticed, and thats why I left you alone and never think about you anymore.
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    Dude, if you fuck with me, I will post the screen shots of your blood drinking ass to every comment you ever make for the rest of your natural fucking life. You hear me son?

                   <p>
                    Lets not go there because this is not about us, its about the research. So far, this is a tragic day for you bro. Just shut the fuck and keep doing better.

                    Nigger you paranoid. I would not waste ten minutes a day thinking about you. But spending one minute triggering you into an argo fit, makes me SMILE. I just contributed a link to a site that can track the Wexler yacht, named Limitless, where Ghislaine Maxwell is likely to be hiding to this thread, what have you done lately?

                    I had no idea licking crensch anus could make a satanic blood drinker so important. I would try it myself, except, I don't need to feel like "Big Argo On Campus." If that shit taste in your mouth makes you happy, go for it. Mix that crensch anus with the blood you drink. You might actually turn into that "Dragon" you claim to be. roflmao

Next time you make a good post, and I want to add good info to it like how to track the Wexler yacht where Ghislaine Maxwell might be hidng, I will just use a different name. I aint petty. I don't care. I was just adding good info. I post here on a regular basis. You just don't know it. I add info through the comments several times a month, you just don't realize it.

                           Q has not been "run out of this sub". As Q reveals more and more pizzagate truths, our research will spread far and wide. I get new followers every day on Twitter, most of them woken by Q, and they regularly see our research. In fact, Q himself taps it from time to time. You succeeded in hurting a few pizzagate researchers who had to delete their accounts. The fact that you take pride in this is all anyone needs to know about your evil intentions.

                            worked to put you in the lead spot. I'm happy about it. You are the best mod pizzagate EVER had. You have exceeded my expectations. I had to fight you to drive Q to its own subs but it would have destroyed pizzagate. Sorry about that bro, but it was necessary for pizzagate to survive. I hope you realize that. My time was worth it.

                       Are you that retarded or just plain out of bullshit to spin? Smoking mushrooms? Jeezuz fuck mate, think before you respond. Or, y'know, take that extra minute and learn when you should stop with the bullshit instead of continuously proving my point about your dishonest contortion of fact.

             Nationwide children's hospital is evil. They tried so hard to steal my daughter and kept her too long. Every time I questioned why she was being overfed and supposedly had eating issues which prolonged her stay they threatened to take her. She was there way past even her due date and the only problem was supposed eating issues, her not being able to eat 1 oz over what her stomach could hold made them use the feeding tube. If she had issues eating why did she leave nearly overweight? The research scientist I met there seemed nuts as well. The study they wanted us to do seemed harmless but then I noticed a lot of babies being kept there for up to like 2 years being used for research. Lots are adopted out too, which is bc they make it so hard for the parents to bring them home. And the social workers lie to parents to make it even more difficult. Then when that didn't stop us the social worker resorted to false CPS reports right after they discharged my daughter. She admitted to it and laughed at me. Seriously.. Getting my daughter out of that hospital was a nightmare! And then they wanted to give her an experimental shot IN OUR HOME when they let her out and created chaos when I refused. They harassed us for months until it was too late to give her the shot. Sorry for ranting but I could write a book on those psychos. Thank you for looking into the evil people working at Nationwide Children's hospital. They abuse and kidnap so many children and no one talks about it. If the general public was aware how corrupt they are they wouldn't get away with it so easily.

              Thanks for contributing your experiences. Sorry you went through that. Hope your daughter is okay now. Has anyone documented medical kidnap in relation to NCH? We should get that linked up here.

               Some interesting connections. Been digging into other avenues recently.

               Clinton F, Rothschild , Royalty, Tate Art Foundation all linked via one person. It's like a spider web of networks. Epstein still has active relatives and connections who own property lettings agencies, art galleries and modelling agencies, many with the same directors across the board.

             There seems to be a common theme. Art galleries, property letting agencies and talent / modelling agencies. It's a network of people who often have the same ties. The UK is ridiculously entrenched within this Epstein guy. Many of his connections are still actively operating for a fact.

              And isn't that the heart of the opiates crisis too?  I seem to recall reading that the county Dayton is in is numero uno in the USA.  I saw an interview with the Coroner there and his small morgue had piles of 20 and 30 somethings dead from ODing.  He said they desparately needed a much bigger facility.

               I don't know if its #1 but its up there. Essentially anything illegal goes through here at some point. In the early days of the opoid thing people would drive down to florida to visit the pill mills. If they started in the NE they travelled through here.

            its pretty wild, that theres so low accountability that this type of thing happens. You'd think the law enforcement would be all over this, but who knows whats going on with the law enforcement and everything in the gov't.
