<p>Blind Item #7
I wish that this convicted child molester who is probably still a B list celebrity was losing his home. The recent legal action against him though just means that he will start charging higher prices for guests to come stay at his out of the country resort for underage sex. Maybe this will affect his ability to pay bribes though and will get him killed.

            Joe Francis .... decades ago, it was known you could get the videotapes of the 'good stuff' if you asked around and paid the right price.
           </p>
           <p>
            The 'Girls Gone Wild Thing' was the tame stuff... he saved the really bad stuff for people with big money to pay.
I think there were alot of girls coming forward saying he drugged them or spiked their drink and they were assaulted.
           </p>
           <p>
            Joe Francis is definitely a creepy guy. He recently was on an episode of the Kardashians... bizarre.

            Yeah what happened is the court ruled he isn't allowed to pocket the money from renting out his villa to
            <s>
             sex tourists
            </s>
            I mean guests, the money has to go directly to fulfilling his $2 million bankruptcy debt.   Pretty sure this means they're keeping an eye on him, and his Mexican version of Lolita Island could be out of business unless people agree to having the courts know exactly how  much money they're spending on their little vacay chez Girls Gone Wild.
