<p>China’s Children Fund – Christian Children’s Fund - ChildFund. Org – McLean, Va – Corruption – Graham Spanier - Penn State- Obama
——————————
ChildFund was founded on October 6, 1938, as China\'s Children Fund by Presbyterian minister J. Calvitt Clarke to aid Chinese children displaced by the Second Sino-Japanese War. As the mission expanded to other countries, the name was changed on February 6, 1951 to Christian Children\'s Fund.[3] After a scandal was exposed, in 2009 the Christian Children’s Fund changed its name to Child Fund International. Somehow this seemed appropriate, since CCF had never had any connection whatsoever to Christianity, and it showed.</p>
<p>https:// en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ChildFund———————
Former Penn State President Graham Spanier’s connection to the university’s football related sex scandal was not his first brush with scandal involving a major organization under his watch</p>
<p>In 1994, while he was Chancellor of the University of Nebraska, Spanier was also Chairman of the Board of the Christian Children’s Fund, the largest child sponsorship organization in the world, located in Richmond (Mclean), Virginia.</p>
<p>Graham Basil Spanier (born July 18, 1948) is a South African-born American sociologist and college administrator who served as the 16th president of Pennsylvania State University, from September 1, 1995, to November 9, 2011, when he was forced to resign in the aftermath of the Penn State child sex abuse scandal.</p>
<p>Spanier is currently president emeritus, university professor, and professor of human development and family studies; sociology, demography, and family; and community medicine. He had a one-year post-presidential sabbatical leave following his resignation as president of Penn State in November 2011. He was later convicted on March 24, 2017, of one misdemeanor charge of child endangerment.

<p>How does Spanier get hired for another job? August 07, 2012</p>
<p>“I am writing in response to The Morning Call article about former Penn State President Graham Spanier. &quot;Mr. Spanier kept his own board of trustees in the dark about allegations of former assistant football coach Jerry Sandusky\'s on-campus shower incidents with young boys,&quot; the story noted.</p>
<p>It is that Mr. Spanier, according to former FBI Director Louis Freeh\'s investigation into Penn State\'s handling of the allegations, who led the university down a path to scandal and shame. So Mr. Spanier resigns in disgrace. With the kind of resume Mr. Spanier should be hard-pressed to get a job as a ditch digger. But, no, the Obama administration has hired him for a top-secret, national security post.</p>
<p>May I ask what could that be, Cover-up Czar? What a sorrowful government we have in this administration. November, come soon, come soon.”</p>

           </p>
           <p>
            Local officials in some provinces engage in child trafficking, and local government officials have a strong relationship with family planning departments.124 Local authorities sometimes confiscated the children from families who were unable to pay fines. 125 According to the Telegraph, a magazine, the head of the village family planning committee in Anxi County, Fujian Province, was suspected of assisting illegal sales of babies. 126 Moreover, in some provinces, since the central government abolished agricultural taxes family planning in local province has raised violation fees in order to boost fiscal budgets.127 Later the family planning violation fees have been increased up to 10,000 yuan,128 which is nearly three times higher than initial fees.129 The close relationship between orphanages and the provincial governments also indicate the high risk of child trafficking. It was revealed that local officials and orphanage employees in Hunan Province had sold at least 100 children to other orphanages.130 The villager in Longhui County, an impoverished rural area in Hunan province, said that in the past, parents who breached a one-child policy, were punished by tearing down their house or forfeiting their

            properties.131 However, since 2000, local authorities have started to confiscate children as punishment.132 In 2005, local government confiscated Mr. Yuan’s 52-day-old daughter when he was unable to show his marriage certificate.133 From 1999 through the late 2006 period, the family planning official in Longhui County abducted at least 16 children, and Mr. Yuan’s daughter was one of them.134 According to parents in Longhui County, local officials have treated babies as “a source of revenue” by imposing fines of $1,000 or more; five times higher than an average local family’s annual income.135 Although it is unclear whether orphanage director did receive the payments because he refused to answer, the villager interviewed with Caixin Magazine that a family planning agency may receive money from the orphanage for the exchange of baby.136 Once these babies are illegally abducted by local authorities, they are sent to orphanages or often put up for adoption by foreigners, even though child is not an orphan.137

           <p>
            Although family planning policies ban the confiscation of children from parents who violate the national policy, critics say “the powers handed to local officials under national family planning regulations remains excessive and ripe for exploitation.”138 Moreover, despite the fact that the authorities have responsibilities to register the birth certificate of every child, they usually fail to do it when there is bribery involved.139

            <p>
             I can't get this out of my mind after reading through some of these links -- what if China's family planning policy was created in 1978 for child sex trafficking and the selling of fetuses, and not just for population control?
            </p>
            <p>
             Even with the two-child policy, women are still screened for pregnancy every four months.  The fines for not aborting and having an out-of-plan child are up to ten times couples' annual income -- not to mention forced abortions, etc.
            </p>
            <p>
             When illegal pregnancies go undetected, what happens to out-of-plan children?  I just read that until 2017, out-of-plan offspring could not receive healthcare, go to school, get a job, or get married, etc.  So whether they were hidden, hunted down and seized by family planning, adopted out over the internet by naive and desperate parents, abandoned, etc., the conditions were ripe for them to be trafficked or work for organized crime.
            </p>
            <p>
             Also Planned Parenthood has one million branches in China.  It all sounds pretty suspicious.

             Also, I just read that that Ng Lap Seng person, sex trafficking kingpin who was close to the Clintons and visited the White House ten times, was part of an elite Chinese government advisory group called Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference.  So sick.

            McCain a nambla supporter.  Not getting this one.  The quote from McCain campaign was accusing Obama of pro policy of pedo grooming for kindergarteners.  The link makes it sound like the it was McCain supporting it. Considering McCain is part of the same Cabal, he may well be for it.  But the link is misleading.  In hindsight it does show the tactics of political spin of the elite party, as if the 2008 election was really about choices.

            hey DK, we need all submission titles to show a connection to pizzagate in some way.
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             Rule 3: All titles must adequately describe post content and must establish direct relevance to pizzagate.
            </p>
           </blockquote>
           <p>
            unfortunately, we are unable to edit titles here on voat.  so we suggest that you self-delete this, rewrite the title to show relevance, and repost it here.  or alternatively, you could post it, as is, to
            <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/v/pizzagatewhatever">

             mentioned putting together megathreads of  info that cross reference PG related material with Q theory.

            <p>
             A cursory view of OP is the beginning of that imo, also, it's a targeted topic resource compilation (that has often been sorely lacking for PG researchers imo).  Not criticizing you doing your part as mod, clearly Rule 3 doesn't anticipate this type of post.  But as this is 'part 3' in a series of posts that were not called out, it seems reasonable to keep it, if the content meets the rules.

             I'm reading this: 5) Spies in Academic Clothing: The Untold History of MKULTRA and the Counterculture – And How the Intelligence Community Misleads the 99%, by Jan Irvin, May 13, 2015

             </a>
             A MUST READ!!!  by all PG researchers, whether pro or dubious about GA as well as all GA researchers.
            </p>
            <p>
             Knowing what we know thus far about the history of the pedo agenda, the history of pedo cover-up, the fact that human trafficking/organ trafficking/MKULTRA/CIA arms trafficking and drug trafficking are all interconnected, I'm assuming that the Rothschild/CIA link alone ties into PG (jumping the gun a bit, have to read it and quote it ;)

             I posted my link here:

             There are other 4 other lengthy works of research that came before (hence #5 lol) but #5 is a good place to start IMO.  It does relate to PG, I'll eventually be posting about it, but it's not going to easy to condense the implications of it.
