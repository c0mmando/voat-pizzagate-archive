<p>In her book &quot;How to Hack a Party Line: The Democrats and Silicon Valley&quot;, Sara Miles writes of an interaction with Tony Podesta--who had just returned from a trip to Romania on behalf of Textron.

<p>Now, on to the topic of Romania-- Textron is not the only point of access for the &quot;Lolita Express&quot; Romania</p>
<p>In an email J.
