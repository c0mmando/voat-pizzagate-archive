<p>One of the key figures in this ring was James McHaney. He was busted in a sting when he was heading over to his friends house to rape a 13 year old boy. He had brought child porn which included babies being raped with him to the intended rape house. </p>
<p>So this guy is one of the worst predators the FBI has ever brought down so you\'d expect to find him on the sex offender registry and sure enough there is a James McHaney on the registry. The problem is that it\'s not him. They found some black dude with the same name to put on the registry so that anyone investigating McHaney would see the name and be satisfied that he is registered. </p>
<p>So why do they go to all this trouble to keep a horrible predator against children off the sex offender registry so that he can keep operating freely. I think I found a huge clue while I was digging. Save this next page because I think they\'ll take it down soon. </p>

             Two White House officials, speaking on the condition of anonymity, said the promise to keep Mr. Bharara on was a product of a chaotic transition process and Mr. Trump’s desire at the time to try to work with
             <strong>
              Senator Chuck Schumer

            One other important point. The GOP is just as involved in this whole thing, so the idea that it was coming to a head in 2009 is pretty laughable. Look at the history of the Finders and Franklin Scandal to see that the FBI has been a large part of the problem, allowing the #pedoelite to run their schemes with protection. There is evidence of cover ups by both GOP and DEMs. They fear Trump as he is not compromised, is an outsider, and has spoken out against this evil.

            this raises a lot of questions.

           <p>
            How many other "mistakes" are there on these registries?

            So you didn't even get a hit on the black dude James McHaney that they have on the registry when you searched "McHaney"? Are you saying not just current but that you'd get their name to come up if they served any time from 1982 to present? Because the black "James McHaney" listing on the registry doesn't provide any sentencing dates or other information. Just a picture of some black dude. The other people I've looked at on the registry showed sentencing dates, crimes they were convicted of, statute information and lots of information. We have to double check this. Are you sure it doesn't just check for current inmates?

            So you're thinking he never even did a day of jail? This has got to go mainstream. A president or two must have got involved. It's crazy.

           <p>
            You could tell by the language he was using while he was walking into the sting that he's taken lunch breaks to rape young boys before. He's like "what time should I be there?" "Does he got any pubes?" He received and distributed the worst child porn I've ever heard of.

            This is an excellent, extremely interesting post on the inner workings of pedophile rings.  If it is deleted from this board it will be a great disservice to the community.  Please post updates no matter what.  Very enlightening.

            Vietnam comrade Wade Sanders to intro Kerry
By Otto Kreisher
Copley News Service
2004-08-14
           </p>
           <p>
            Thirty-eight years ago, when they both were young Navy officers and a bit naive, Wade Sanders and John Kerry shared pizzas and beer and became friends while training in San Diego. Their naivete vanished, but their friendship deepened when both later commanded swift boats on dangerous, but seemingly senseless, missions in Vietnam.
           </p>
           <p>
            Thursday night, Sanders joined a dozen other graying men who had shared Kerry's Vietnam combat experiences in helping to introduce the new Democratic presidential nominee to the nation.
           </p>
           <p>
            It was by now a familiar role for Sanders, who had supported his friend's successful campaign for the nomination and, more recently, has tried to shield him from the attacks of other veterans angered by Kerry's high-profile opposition to the war in the early 1970s.
           </p>
           <p>
            "Many people are displeased with John Kerry's protest against the war. I have no problem with that. We honor them as veterans," Sanders said in a recent interview. "But they have used half-truths to discredit Kerry."
Sanders, who stayed in the Navy after Vietnam and retired as a captain in the Navy Reserves, approved of Kerry's protest of the war, which both had concluded was sacrificing young men in an poorly run and unwinnable conflict.
           </p>
           <p>
            Sanders had gone to Vietnam before Kerry and already had lost a crewmember. He told Kerry shortly after his arrival in country from swift boat training at in in San Diego: "What we're doing is really crazy... It's not what we thought it was going to be at Coronado."
           </p>
           <p>
            After his active duty Navy tour, Sanders became a lawyer in San Diego. He served as a deputy assistant Navy secretary for reserve affairs for former President Bill Clinton. While in that office, he helped lead an effort to restore a sunken swift boat as a memorial to the thousands of sailors who had served and sacrificed aboard those lightly protected craft.
           </p>
           <p>
            Kerry and Sanders joined with other swift boat veterans in the "Last River Run Reunion" when the memorial was dedicated in 1995 at the Washington Navy Yard.

            FBI: Staffer for Sen. Maria Cantwell sought tryst with boy
The Smoking Gun, Dec 3
           </p>
           <p>
            DECEMBER 3--A U.S. Senate aide was arrested Friday after allegedly arranging a lunchtime sexual encounter with a teenage boy, according to federal court records. James McHaney, 28, was nabbed by FBI agents after he arranged the afternoon liaison via a "cooperating witness" working with investigators. According to the below felony complaint and an accompanying statement of facts filed in U.S. District Court in Washington, D.C., the CW and McHaney were conversing online Friday afternoon when the CW asked whether McHaney was interested in engaging in anal sex with a 13-year-old boy. "I'll be there," McHaney allegedly replied. He later asked for a photo of the child with whom he and the CW would have sex and whether the boy had "any pubes." When told no, McHaney allegedly replied, "That's hot." McHaney was nabbed in the lobby of an unnamed "predetermined location," where he had arranged to meet CW. Until his arrest Friday, McHaney had worked as the D.C. scheduler for Democratic Senator Maria Cantwell. A caller to Cantwell's office was told late today that, as of last Friday, McHaney no longer worked for the Washington state politician.

            And a Democrat no less.

            I sure would be interested in seeing any stats which present the percentages of these kinds of things in politicians of all stripes and levels compared to general population.

            Four gay men, willing to put their names in print and whose allegations can't be disproved, have come forward since news of U.S. Sen. Larry Craig's guilty plea. They say they had sex with Craig or that he made a sexual advance or that he paid them unusual attention.

            The denials began June 30, 1982, when CBS broke news of a scandal alleging gay sex between congressmen and underage pages. The following day, before any public allegation that he was involved, then-Rep. Craig issued a denial. Craig married a year later and adopted the three children of his wife, Suzanne. In 1990, the Idaho Statesman asked Craig about an allegation that he was gay made by an opponent in his first Senate race. "Why don't you ask my wife?" Craig replied.
Oh, and has anyone heard anything about the Mark Foley scandal? Another one that just went away...

             I don't think that judge is the father. I thought the father was also named James Michael McHaney. But that judge sure does look like he's related to the pedo McHaney. And his grandfather was also named James Michael McHaney and was the famous prosecutor at Nuremberg. Very important family and very connected.

Connection to convicted pedophile and former senate aide, James Michael McHaney
From the Fox News article, Former Senate Aide Pleads Guilty to Federal Child Pornography Charge, by the Associated Press, 
published on February 14th, 2008:[4]
A former aide to Sen. Maria Cantwell, D-Wash., pleaded guilty Thursday to a federal child pornography charge.
James Michael McHaney of Washington, D.C., faces up to 10 years in prison after his felony conviction. He was fired from his job as a scheduler for Cantwell after his arrest last year. Earlier, he had worked for the 2004 presidential campaigns of Democrats Dick Gephardt and John Kerry.
Prosecutors say McHaney, 28, tried to arrange a sexual encounter with a 13-year-old boy last November. Police later found child pornography in his car and home. He was initially charged with attempting to sexually exploit a minor, but pleaded guilty to a reduced charge of possession of child pornography. Prosecutors said he had more than 1,000 images of child pornography, as well as videos and DVDs portraying children as young as three engaged in sexual conduct.

            </a>
            McHaney's lawyer, Thomas Abbenante, called the case "a very tragic situation" for McHaney and his family. McHaney's parents were in court Thursday as U.S. District Judge Thomas Hogan approved the plea agreement.
The parents declined to comment, as did Assistant U.S. Attorney Jean Sexton, who prosecuted the case.
McHaney, who has been jailed since his Nov. 30 arrest, was dressed in a blue, short-sleeved prison-issued jumpsuit and answered in a clear voice as Hogan questioned him during the 45-minute court hearing.
Federal sentencing guidelines call for McHaney to receive anywhere from eight to 10 years in prison, although attorneys for both sides said that could be significantly reduced because he is a first-time offender and has cooperated with authorities. A hearing is scheduled May 1.
According to court papers presented by prosecutors and signed by McHaney, McHaney was at his Senate job on Nov. 30 when an unidentified witness, who was working with police, contacted him online. The witness asked whether McHaney, known as Mike, was interested in sex with a 13-year-old boy.
"I'll be there," McHaney replied, the document said.
McHaney said he could "take a long lunch" and agreed to bring "visual aids" to a meeting with the witness. Police later discovered a portable flash drive with more than 1,000 pornographic images.
The FBI arrested McHaney when he arrived for the meeting. He was fired from his Senate job hours later.
As part of the plea agreement, authorities seized McHaney's car, a 1999 Honda Civic, as well as two laptop computers, a Senate-issued BlackBerry and several DVDs and videos, among other items.
A spokeswoman for Cantwell declined to comment Thursday.

            Your post is good and TY for it!  Your title needs some work...allow me to elaborate on what Pizzagate NOW is to me...and then perhaps you will understand some of your comments here...
           </p>
           <p>
            -during WWII we were shocked to find out from our spies that the nazi's were working with aliens..yes non humans
-in or about 1946 we made a deal with the nazi's (Paperclip) and reptilian aliens.  This deal was a technology transfer, but was also a deal whereby we allowed their interference with us
-I believe some in gvt also learned at this time that the aliens were working with some families already including the Rothschild, Rockefeller's, Belgian Royals, etc..in fact we learned that these families were actually descendants of these alien races and had "royal blood"
-the CIA was formed around this time (OSS and all...) but part of the mission of the CIA was to work with these alien races on the alien agenda (which meant working for royal families, etc)
-these royal alien bloodlines have a culture of what we would view as satanic rituals including human sacrifice..part of our "deal" was to allow this behavior  or at least turn a blind eye
-royal bloodline families "disassociate" their youth..meaning they are raped and tortured as very young children which causes a personality shattering, but results in them being controllable and probably assists somehow in the spiritual values of these folks.
-the CIA learned this trick in the 50's and began several programs to "disassociate" people with the intent of making them controllable robots.
-the CIA program was dubbed MKUltra/Monarch and resulted in many "slaves" and controllable people from police sheriffs to politicians
-over time the CIA has become proficient and running the "slaves" as prostitutes...further CIA also proficient at providing "human sacrifices" to "royal bloodlines"
-over time the CIA has learned it can make ALOT of money on human trafficking including prostitution, pedophilia, human organs, etc and has formed companies like Dyncorp to mine these activities
-I believe almost every FBI level arrest of a pedophile results in a choice...you either 1.  work for us or 2.  you give us your kids to use in our programs or 3. you go to jail for a LONG time..
-this recruiting program has resulted in MANY children being used, programmed, etc
-The Finders scandal in DC in the early 90's another tip of the iceberg which exposed part of this and was quickly swept under the rug
-Elites are now presented with a choice to get into the illumanti/satanic/alien/royal bloodline club...rape and kill this child (they believe they use the energy created from the sacrifice)...
-Everyone in the "club" is equally culpable and there may be other ways in..but if you want super riches you do super bad things..
-this has created a culture of pedophilia and human sacrifice
-Comet Ping Pong appears to be a front..and a very in your face front..for this type of activity..even to the point of selling children on their instagram
-James Alefantis (comet owner) is tied to satanic rituals, elitist, child abuse, etc, etc a hundred ways from sunday..also tied to Haiti child trafficking, etc  LOTS of this board about this choad...
-HRC is tied to the elitist royal blood line pedophilia human sacrifice
-WJC is tied to the same and also to Epstein and Lolita express...also tied to numerous human trafficking schemes to make $$.  Start a war, harvest orphans, harvest human organs, make big $$
-FBIAnon claims these folks make up 30% of our government
-numerous pizza place now tied to this...and appear to be fronts for abusing and selling children
-we have been being groomed to view this as "normal"...I read a paper by the science advisor to THORN (Demi Moore and Ashton Kutcher's human trafficking organization) expressing that pedophilia should be viewed as "another" sexual orientation..so pedo bathrooms?  Not in my frickin' world...but clearly we are being led down a path or "normalcy"
-also satanic or lets say ancient iraq religious tolerance

               It is a key to this entire system revolving around Pizzagate and Global Criminal Corruption linked to the Rockefellers, Rothschilds, Prince Charles and British Royalty, Kissinger, Dulles and other global families and power societies linked to CIA's shadow government and other shadow groups. Racine's entire history is linked with the Pilgrims Society through John Jeffry Louis among many others.

             That's a good retort because I said no anonymous sources, but this instance is an exception. She's an insider with these Democrat staffer types and she was just providing background, nothing that was supposed to be implicating and not be verifiable which is the problem I have with secret sources. So in this instance, there is no reason to question her use of the material garnered from unnamed sources.

            Is it James McHaney or Mike McHaney? maybe I'm missing something since there are 10 comments and it is not an issue? i'm a little confused. Thanks!

             EXTREMELY odd this predator cannot be found on the sex offender registry.

             Seems there has definitely been some scrubbing going on regarding this matter.

              That's him. Doesn't look a thing like the James McHaney on the sex offender registry. Not even the same color. The msm should be on that even if they don't believe there's any Clinton connection. It's the kind of Richie Rich stuff that they used to always love reporting.

               James Michael McHaney of Washington, D.C., faces up to 10 years in prison after his felony conviction. He was fired from his job as a scheduler for Cantwell after his arrest last year. Earlier, he had worked for the 2004 presidential campaigns of Democrats Dick Gephardt and John Kerry.

              Further more, Considering this information is a grain of salt, and almost every insinuation and claim he;s made is incorrect.

             <p>
              "The Senatorial offices of Barbara Boxer and Maria Cantwell were responsible for the worst child porn distribution network until they were busted and jailed. I'm gonna give you the links after I summarize."
             </p>
             <p>
              No. they weren't. They were simply involved... Literally no one of importance(compared to the people of actual importance) was charged. No one "turned in bigger fish" of importance.
             </p>
             <p>
              I can't rationalize this sentence. I've spent 5 minutes trying to. First off.... Barbara boxer didn't resign, She retired... And 8 years after this "bust of the worst pedo ring" went down.
             </p>
             <p>
              "As Mike McHaney heads to his court hearing today, friends and acquaintances of the disgraced staffer for Sen. Maria Cantwell are coming forward to speak about his history of odd behavior. By now we’ve heard a few more things. According to those who know him, he got his start in politics doing advance work for Bill Clinton’s campaign (his parents, who live in Little Rock, Arkansas, are allegedly friends with the Clintons)."
             </p>
             <p>
              I'M USING QUOTES to quote OP. He doesn't Provide quotes to insinuate he's quoting the article...&gt; but that's irrelevant. THE ARTICLE IS FROM FUCKING 2007.
             </p>
             <p>
              Barbra Boxer never resigned, and was in office until 2016.  AM I THE CRAZY ONE HERE! SOME PLEASE TELL ME HOW ANYTHING OP SAID, MAKES THE SLIGHTEST SENSE.
             </p>
             <p>
              WHAT THE ACTUAL FUCK!  He doesn't quote this, So I don't know if he's claiming that he took that from the article
             </p>
             <p>
              "Rosato apparently was the ring leader because he had no one to turn on and he got the big jail sentence and is listed in the sex offender registry."
             </p>
             <p>
              I honestly have no clue what the fuck that means. Based on my current interpretation, he's saying this guy was at the top.... Which is fucking insane.
             </p>
             <p>
              There's always someone bigger to turn in.... But the thing is, If you're involved in pizzagate, you don't just "Turn in bigger fish" that's not how this works.
             </p>
             <p>
              Lastly. If you're "Responsible for the largest child porn ring" You don't get 3 years. These people OP mention are probably all out of jail.  I don't know. I don't care, this post is shit, considering he claimed to solve pizzagate.
             </p>
             <p>
              GOOD INFORMATION OP. But you've distracted any rational person, by claiming you solved pizzagate, when you didn't solve anything. And by making outrageous claims and insinuations that are mostly wrong.
             </p>
             <p>
              If I completely misinterpreted all of this, then FUCK ME, I'm the retard.... But did I misinterpret anything? Anyone?  I Feel like I must be, because not a single person is addressing all of this outrageous shit.

               You seem very upset and doing a lot of nitpicking. Barbara Boxer retired instead of resigned? The ones who resign almost always do it by "retiring". As far as Rosato being at the top, I just meant that he was probably the provider of the porn because that is where the trail apparently ended. I don't have evidence of any further prosecutions related to this ring. We don't know how far the trail went to get to Rosato. We just know McHaney's friend turned him in and McHaney turned Rosato in. The unknown guy who turned McHaney in may have been turned in himself for someone before him to get a lighter sentence.

               Have to agree here, good analysis. OP did some effective research on this particular ring earlier then went off the rails based on a ten year old Wonkette post ffs.

               Also 'solving pizzagate' is self-important nonsense. Pedogate is a huge network with innumerable nodes and endpoints. There's no 'solving' a case here. It's not a fucking game of Clue.

                I don't know about that. Snopes and the msm pretty much narrowly defined Pizzagate as a DC pedo ring run by the Clintons. You can work on whatever other nodes and endpoints you envision.

               I could do without the expletives but I agree, OP is short on actual research, the title is purplish and overwrought - "I'VE DAMM NEAR SOLVED PIZZAGATE"  who claims that?

               My impression was that linked article was essentially gossip which is what Wonkette is.

                 true, caps emphasis is mine, to demonstrate how the language comes off to readers.  Caps wasn't the criticism, it was the wording itself.
                 <br/>
                 Overwrought -  High in drama and lacking any emotional restraint

                <p>
                 It is indeed overwrought for any one person to claim they may have "solved" pizzagate, or that pizzagate as a criminal cartel with many moving parts can actually be "solved" in one post, especially with what you provided with Wonkette gossip about just one individual with a couple of contacts.

                 Case rested.  I have no objections to your post, I even found it entertaining.  The title though is obnoxious and shades into the Distraction Tactic of shills and trolls.

                    Well let's see: I've heard concern about the title, concern about my name, concern about forgetting a quotation mark for a paragraph that was obviously lifted from the link I posted just before that paragraph. Concern about resign vs retire. Just lots and lots of concern going on.

                I can tell you that I'm not a hyped up teen, so you'll have to explain for whom you think I'm shilling. I don't think the Clintons like that I've made the connection and the pedos working for these Democrat Senators probably don't like me putting their crimes out there for all to see so you don't mean that you think I'm shilling for them, do you? Hard to see how exposure works to their benefit.

                 These connections were made in earlier posts. The facts (including the article) go back to 2007 and earlier. There is much misinformation in your post, exposed in the comments. I hope you are with us in trying to nail the perps, but your hyped email took your credibility to a low level. Just post what you find without hype, and if it is a strong addition, it will rise to the top and bring more digging if justified.

             so you are willing to pick and choose your resources. odd behaviour isnt fucking factual bruv. ur name is kuru. get with the program this shit is worldwide and involves all levels of infrastructure in business, govt, and entertainment. has been going on for at least hundreds of years if not longer. maybe easier to get people to recognize they are corrupt but what the fuck is the point in not going the whole way? we dont achieve anything likethat

            That is a good lead, but this is just a small part of the system of elite corruption that goes to the most powerful people in the world. You are right that the Clintons are involved, and the real answer to Pizzagate and Global Criminal Corruption is Racine, Wisconsin linked to Bill and Hillary through many channels most notably sustainable development leading to Agenda 2030, the Rothschilds, the Rockefellers, Knights of Pythias, Pilgrims Society, Scottish Rite Freemasons, mafia and gangs, viruses and vaccines, trafficking, collusion, and the bigger picture. All roads link back to Racine, which is alarming - it is Paul Ryan's district.

             I have seen your arguments (or maybe someone else's) regarding Racine before, usually in comments.  I find it intriguing - have you done a full submission on this?  Has someone else/  if they have link it.   I'd like to see this thread of inquirey more fully fleshed out by people like yourself who are from the area.

              Racine, Wisconsin is the key to solving Pizzagate and Global Criminal Corruption. More is being connected and investigated each day. The full story will come out soon, but if people want to solve this puzzle, we need help putting the spotlight on Racine. A few of the major links are Pilgrims Society (see John Jeffry Louis for starters), Knights of Pythias (see Anthony Weiner and Chuck Schumer), the Clinton Foundation / Clinton Global Initiative / Agenda 2030 (Agenda 21 - see Racine Sustainable Development connections), Viruses (see Rockefeller and Zika Virus), Vaccines (see Polio and Gates Foundation), mafia (long history in Racine and Kenosha with links to Chicago), and water (see Lake Michigan / Milwaukee 7 / Scott Walker).
             </p>
             <p>
              Everyone in Racine is either involved or threatened. The politicians are corrupt, the DA and law enforcement is corrupt, the Wisconsin AG is corrupt, and Loretta Lynch personally stonewalled RICO investigations into Racine. Nothing needs to be fleshed out regarding local Pizzagate and Corruption related crimes. Racine is a known cesspool. It needs a global spotlight so people can see the real truth and how this was all covered up and protected by and for the elite who are involved. It is the barometer to see if Trump and Sessions are really going to do something about Pizzagate and Global Criminal Corruption or not. If they can't drain the swamp in Paul Ryan's backyard, we will allow they are fake.
             </p>
             <p>
              This is cut and dry racketeering, collusion, cover ups, embezzlement, laundering, trafficking, extortion, bribery, fraud, bid rigging, election rigging, and other crimes including a long history of pedo and satanic crimes, and abuse at all levels from day cares to youth detention centers to prisons. Racine is the domino that will work better on Pizzagate and Global Criminal Corruption.

              The way it goes on and on about it, it's basically a thread derail.  Nice of the OP not to complain about it.

              Research it and dispute ANYTHING you think you can. Racine, Wisconsin is the answer to Pizzagate and Global Criminal Corruption.

              DC = Paul Ryan (from Racine County), Reince Priebus (from Kenosha), the Clintons (Clinton Foundation and Clinton Global Initiative partners and donors, and Sustainability - see Agenda 2030), McCain (Arizona State, McCain Institute, etc), Anthony Weiner and Chuck Schumer (Knights of Pythias) and others all closely connect with Racine, Wisconsin.
             </p>
             <p>
              London = Pilgrims Society links US Business interests with the UK and the royal families, see John Jeffry Louis for starters, Rockefeller and Rothschilds connections to Racine, Wisconsin
             </p>
             <p>
              Vatican City = The American Pope is from near Racine (Timothy Dolan), and Racine is a cesspool of criminal corruption with links to the church, Catholic schools, mafia, Sicilians, Dominicans, Franciscans and others who are all covering up Pizzagate and Global Criminal Corruption
             </p>
             <p>
              Racine, Wisconsin is also tied to Pennsylvania (Allentown/PSU and current FBI investigations), New York (Weiner, Clintons, Rockefellers, Colleges), Arizona (McCain, ASU), Denver (Freemason / DHS), Los Angeles (actors and actresses), Haiti, Ghana, Norway and other hubs of Pizzagate and Global Criminal Corruption.
             </p>
             <p>
              Racine is a weak link to all of these connections. Why would Loretta Lynch personally stonewall investigations into Racine, Wisconsin? We need to put the spotlight on Racine - it is Reince Priebus and Paul Ryan's district that is a known cesspool of Pizzagate and Global Criminal Corruption.

               Again you provided no links and I dont know where to begin to look for these connections unless you know this instinctively?
              </p>
              <p>
               How would you describe Racine compared to Arden Delaware where that is a full on Satanic town possibly CIA controlled?

              </p>
              <p>
               Maybe you can make a thread on here or pizzagatewhatever detailing all these connections and names and ping me and others when your done as this sounds like it could lead to important findings.

                It is very similar and tightly controlled and connected to the Rockefeller and Rothschild-controlled elements of the CIA.
               </p>
               <p>
                Racine is a playground for the elite only an hour from Chicago accessible through a controlled harbor. It is a sanctuary city rife with trafficking, corruption and satanic abuse.

                More information will follow soon, stay tuned, and thank you for the link to Arden. This is exactly how we are going to solve Pizzagate working together.

              Research it and you will see it is all true. Read all of the comments posted before. Look up Sustainability and Agenda 2030. Look up Bill Clinton Sustainability. Look up who donated to Clinton Foundation. Look up who owns the Zika virus patent. Look up the Knights of Pythias. Look up John Jeffry Louis and Pilgrims Society. Everything is connected to Racine, Wisconsin.

               A lot of people donated to the Clinton Foundation.  NARROW IT DOWN and post it, with a verified link.  Stop it - you think you can just throw out assetions and others are going to scramble to do the sweatwork.  DO THE WORK.

              That is correct. Have you researched it yet? Do you know where the American Pope is from. Do you know what the Pilgrims Society is? Do you know what the Knights of Pythias is? Do you know who the Rockefellers and Rothschilds are? They all link to Racine, Wisconsin.
             </p>
             <p>
              Do your research. This is not a laughing matter. Lives are at stake.

              Equineluvr's sub history - wants to report threads, but wants to keep it's (fake?) complaints "sekret".   throws up something in a movie and a couple of news articles, then thinks that establishes some sort of status to be condescending, tear down almost anyone else, bark and laugh at newcomers like a hyena, accuses me of being either a "priest, pedophile or freemason" because I don't think the number 3 automatically means SATAN.

               Him and a few others are following and downvoting everything about Racine, Wisconsin even after sending them more information and details to research. Racine is the key. Anyone who refuses to see these connections is either blind or involved.
              </p>
              <p>
               This is too complex to summarize in a few paragraphs and links, but is not that hard to look up anything mentioned and verify there are sources everywhere that verify the connections. Why won't EquineLuvr and others investigate it? No one can dispute Racine's extreme corruption and ties to Pizzagate and the most powerful societies in the world. It is the answer to Pizzagate and Global Criminal Corruption.
              </p>
              <p>
               Real lives are at stake. We are calling for an open investigation into everything connected to Racine - from Knights of Pythias to Pilgrims Society to DuPont to Monsanto to Dyncorp to Council on Foreign Relations to World Business Council to Agenda 2030.
              </p>
              <p>
               Very powerful people are desperate and willing to threaten lives and do anything to keep the light off of Racine, Wisconsin. If there is nothing to hide, why would they be so afraid of an open investigation?

                I am going to answer you one more time and I really hope you take what I am going to say to heart.
               </p>
               <p>
                If you don't make a submission about this with all of your best links and put it up as a submission, you are diluting your message and no one cares.  I don't care.  Your evidence is scattered throughout comments, and it appears that you expect to get someone else interested in what you are saying enough to do all the work of putting it together for you.   But it isn't happening.  I'm not going to do it.  this is your interest, you need to do it.  AND STOP COMPLAINING THAT SOMEONE ELSE ISN'T DOING IT when you won't even do it.
               </p>
               <p>
                Not trying to be harsh, I'm trying to encourage you to just do it.    As it is what you have is largely unsourced, whiney, also somewhat of a derail to other threads.   That is why you aren't getting a great response.  If you are on to something it might also be that you make it easy for shills to attack because your message isn't unified.  I don't know any other way I can spell this out.  So put all your comments and links together offline in a word file, organize it, edit it, make it a compelling, supportive argument, post it as a submission with a well thought out title, and I'm sure you will get a reaction more along the lines you are looking for.
               </p>
               <p>
                If you truely believe what you have written, it is your duty to do this. I am not going to answer any arguments you have about how real this is until you put it together and post it.   Take your time if you need to.  It might take you a couple of days.  Enough.

                 This is part of the strategy to get the word out in as many places as possible while the full story with full links and details is being developed. It is very in-depth. It is hundreds of pages, dozens of hours of footage, and many witnesses who have had their lives ruined or threatened. It is hard to summarize into one post, but that is in progress and will happen soon.
                </p>
                <p>
                 This is very real and very serious. Please help submit anything you find as well. We need as much help as possible. Some other users have been sending very relevant links to other communities and to other connections like Stratfor. These are helpful in connecting more dots.
                </p>
                <p>
                 Thank you for the honest response, and please support the investigation. Despite a few shills, more people are starting to realize it is all true and a huge key to the puzzle.
                </p>

                 Robert David Steele knows it is true and admitted that he knows that "Paul Ryan, Reince Priebus and Scott Walker are road kill" and their involvement will be revealed soon. He would not say this unless he knew it was inevitable through leaks. They are covering up the biggest secrets in the world.

               Many Racine pizza places have known links to the mafia, such as Infusino's for example. Long ago, the mafia setup pizza places throughout the area to launder and traffic anything they needed. The mafia is still very powerful in the area, and one of more recent cases involved Dennis Troha and others in kickback schemes. Racine and the mafia are very involved in trafficking as a sanctuary city with access to Milwaukee and Chicago, and ties to the global elite.
              </p>
              <p>
               On a related note - "Jon Ferraro, owner of Silk Exotic strip clubs in Milwaukee, Juneau and Middleton, has been indicted in a federal racketeering investigation targeting the Russian mafia, the Journal Sentinel reports."
              </p>
              <p>
               Racine is a cesspool of corruption, mafia ties, trafficking (all kinds), pedo crimes, satanic abuse, racketeering, gangs, murder, sudden retirements, and mysterious suicides. It is linked to the mafia from Milwaukee and Kenosha to Chicago, as well as Sicilians, Dominicans, Franciscans, Irish and more. The mafia and gangs work together with secret societies to protect each others interest in Pizzagate and Global Criminal Corruption.

             Hes right that its easier to spread the idea since everyone acknowledges they're corrupt as fuck. Look at Hillary's approval numbers, tons of people know she's evil.  So pizzagate being Hillary and the fag dc socialite trafficking kids should still be defended, as we must play by the medias rules anyway
