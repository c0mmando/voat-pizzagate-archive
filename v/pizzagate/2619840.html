            Nope. There is a PG cover-up, not a PG investigation. There can't be both. So this is meaningless.

            I would actually love to see Craig Sawyer take the initiative and be part of the task force involved with arresting these people. I think that would be amazing to get helmet or body cam footage of it all happening.

             Craig Sawyer is a FAKE, FAKE, FAKE, FAKE just as InfoWars and Alex Jones are.
            </p>
            <p>
             When someone is selling out to InfoWars and Netflix while applauding Ashton Kutcher for his efforts to combat human trafficking, you know they are compromised or woefully uninformed. How old was Mila Kunis again when they hooked up on That 70's Show? Why was Demi Moore a high priestess in a secret sex cult? What is Ashton's favorite hat?

              Craig is going about it differently, and everyone has to make money. You think chasing these people full time doesn't get expensive with traveling and having a team? You need funding. It becomes your business and you have to make money in doing it to keep going. That's why he and Alex Jones have a brand. I'll always respect Alex Jones as the guy who broke into Bohemian Grove and ripped the lid off of it. That video is still being talked about years later and used as a reference. Now, Alex Jones knows way too much and it's made him over the top crazy. He has so much info coming at him there is no way for him to decipher all of it. Craig Sawyer strongly believes that pizzagate is real and mentions Podesta by name in podcasts and he's openly chasing after pedophiles with a joint task force teams to end human trafficking.

            Comments also mentioned that Weinerboy and Human Abedin are in the process of getting divorced,

            The videos on Weiner's laptop expose all the big names those videos must be leaked by NYPD or FBI or Q if what they are rumored to show is real then at least 75 big power players will be exposed there will have to be mass arrests starting with Hillary and Podesta this is what must happen and it's up to patriots who have access to the laptop videos to leak them.

              Weiner's laptop is only a small piece of the bigger pizza pie. The corruption is too pervasive for the dysfunctional judicial system.

              It seems pretty logical, actually, the laptop used to belong to huma... And therefore could contain "insurance" files both for huma herself, as well as for Hillary. You see if you have the dirt on someone and they want you dead, you give that dirt to trusted people to hold on to. Hillary could have given that to huma... So if something happens to Hillary huma releases the dirt on the suspect. As well huma could have had the same sort of files. This really isn't that far fetched of an idea. It actually seems very likely to me that based on this laptop used to belong to huma, based on also that even the IMAP mail connection to the state department wasn't uninstalled. Clearly when they gave it to Anthony they didn't wipe it, so plenty of humas stuff would still be on it..

               You are not using  logic here.  You are using you imagination.  You are assuming a lot of facts and then writing a screenplay that fits your previous assumptions.

                 Not only have I used logic and common sense, I've shown that the Weiner laptop story was a hoax and I showed this over a year ago.  The story that that NYPD had Weiner's laptop and the FBI yanked it away from them in a cover up has been shattered by evidence from the past month.
                </p>
                <p>
                 It was an obvious hoax the second it came out 2016, which tons of sites ALL claiming to have "NYPD sources."   The first mention of these NYPD sources was a fake account on Facebook.  When reporters found the woman behind this account, she was a 60 year-old woman in Joplin, MO, not the kind of person that NYPD sources would be leaking earth-shattering info to, and she refused to explain anything.

                 The first mention on Twitter was from anonymous Anti-Semitic account who linked to her Facebook post and ALSO claimed NYPD sources.  From here it went to various anonymous forums  and websites before it ever "was reported."   Both  of these posts were pushed by bots.
                </p>
                <p>
                 Here's a bullshitter on YouTube pushing this same story before it was "reported."
                 <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=1&amp;v=-5yAcG4JofU">
                  https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=1&amp;v=-5yAcG4JofU
                 </a>
                </p>
                <p>
                 This guy reported there were three separate insurance folders of hot, hot, hot criminal stuff.  He also reported that the laptop would show the inventors of ISIS are Joe Lieberman, John McCain, and Lindsey Graham.
                </p>
                <p>
                 This story has all be blown to smithereens.   The warrant to seize the laptop has been released.   We know the NYPD did not seize the laptop the FBI did.  The IG report that just came out has a whole chapter on handling of Weiner's laptop the NYPD is not mentioned at all.

                  Hello again. I'm posting a response to this because it is wildly out of character for you to do this kind of thing. Usually you debunk what can be debunked, and then express skepticism (or say nothing) about whatever you can't actually disprove. Very lawyerly and prudent. I have always respected your skills even though you're working for insanely evil people.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  But here you've just -- it's so unlike you that I'm having trouble finding the right phrase. You've jumped the shark, man. You're spouting gibberish. Let's start with
                  <a href="https://www.theepochtimes.com/search-warrant-for-anthony-weiners-laptop-unsealed_2529665.html">
                   this story from May 18th of this year
                  </a>
                  . It is was written by a real reporter, Peter Svab, and contains several verifiable items.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  First, it says the judge Denise Cote sentenced Anthony Weiner to 21 months in prison last September.
                  <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2017/09/25/politics/anthony-weiner-sentencing/index.html">
                   Here's CNN confirming that happened.
                  </a>
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  Next, it says that the same judge, Denise Cote, unsealed the NYPD search warrant on May 18th of this year. The NYPD search warrant was originally issued by Magistrate Judge Ronald Ellis on September 26, 2016.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  It's easy to verify that Ellis is indeed a NY Magistrate on his Wikipedia page. I haven't found the entire unsealed document, but I did find
                  <a href="http://www.brainstain.co.uk/2018/05/22/search-warrant-anthony-weiner-laptop-unsealed/">
                   this article which contains an image of the first page
                  </a>
                  .
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  Now, here's where it (and by "it" I mean your behavior) gets particularly weird. In the
                  <em>
                   Epoch Times
                  </em>
                  story, Svab notes some key differences in language between the NYPD warrant and the FBI warrant. The FBI warrant specifically limits the scope of the investigation to Hillary Clinton's emails. When the FBI warrant was unsealed in December 2016, that feature was widely discussed in the media. The NYPD warrant did not set any limit of that kind. And of course, since we know that Weiner was convicted
                  <em>
                   specifically of sexting
                  </em>
                  , presumably someone somewhere made a search of the devices he would have used to sext with (like his laptop). So there's nothing the least bit surprising or confusing about there being an NYPD search warrant not limited to Clinton emails. Although it remained sealed, the existence of the NYPD warrant was logically implied from the beginning since we knew (a) the FBI warrant unsealed in Dec 2016 was limited, and (b) Weiner was nonetheless convicted. QED.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  What I mean to say is, there's no reason for you to have ever believed, back in 2016 or today, that the NYPD warrant was a hoax. The sequence of events precludes you thinking that. You might believe that the NYPD warrant didn't reveal evidence of horrifying sex crimes by the Clintons (as opposed to just horrifying sex crimes by Anthony Weiner) but it makes no sense to think there wasn't a warrant.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  So now, about those horrifying sex crimes. You are correct about one thing. It does appear that there was a post about "NYPD sources" by Carmen Katz (a Twitter account owned by Cynthia Campbell) on October 31st 2016, saying they had found all kinds of damning evidence on the laptop. If that was the only place that "NYPD sources" had been mentioned, that might cause people to doubt the authenticity of the leak. But it's not.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  Incidentally, I'm guessing that you probably read about Carmen Katz / Cynthia Campbell in
                  <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-news/anatomy-of-a-fake-news-scandal-125877/">
                   this Dec 2017 Rolling Stone article
                  </a>
                  . That article actually traces the origin of the rumor back several days further, to Oct. 28th. It gives a lot of detail about how the Carmen Katz version was spread by a bot net and by InfoWars. I imagine that those details are true, that there was indeed a bot net. But did you read the part about Erik Prince?
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  Erik Prince gave numerous interviews on November 4th, saying that he knew senior people in the NYPD and that they had told him about the horrible sex crimes that had been revealed. Prince didn't say, "I know a guy who knows a guy," and he didn't say that he got it from Carmen Katz. Here's
                  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xg1r3BAPVbo">
                   an audio track of him saying that he got it directly from the NYPD
                  </a>
                  . Also, Rudy Giuliani gave interviews saying essentially the same thing only more discreetly. I watched him give one on Fox at the time. He did not cite Carmen Katz or Twitter.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  Now, why does this matter? Well, not for the first time, your ability to dismiss Pizzagate as a right-wing fever dream comes down to saying that multiple credible witnesses are just making sh*t up. I concede that Carmen Katz and the Twitter bots had the story a week before Prince confirmed it. I also concede that Carmen Katz is shady as hell. So what?
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  The story has not been blown to smithereens, and it wasn't a hoax. The absolute most that you can assert at this point is either that the NYPD lied to Prince and Giuliani, or that they both lied about talking to the NYPD. The rest of the story is a matter of bland bureaucratic record.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  And before you tell me (which of course you will) that Prince and Giuliani are both evil lying partisan bastards who would say anything to win an election, I'll just add one more thing. The person who ordered the unsealing of the NYPD warrant was Amanda Kramer of the NY Southern District. According to
                  <a href="http://www.brainstain.co.uk/2018/05/22/search-warrant-anthony-weiner-laptop-unsealed/">
                   this article
                  </a>
                  :
                 </p>
                 <blockquote>
                  <p>
                   Amanda Kramer has been an Assistant United States Attorney in the United States’ Attorney’s office for the Southern District of New York since 2008, where she serves as Senior Litigation Counsel and the Office’s Human Trafficking and Project Safe Childhood Coordinator.
                  </p>
                 </blockquote>
                 <p>
                  Not saying that her being associated with the Human Trafficking office proves anything definite. But it is interesting. It is part of a recent pattern. This is sort of like the Bigfish story, where more than a year ago, the case was referred to the DC police and seemed to die -- only then months later, the DC police confirm that it did not die, that it has been handed over to an expert in child sex trafficking. You said Bigfish was lying too.

The FBI warrant specifically limits the scope of the investigation to Hillary Clinton's emails.

                   This is not where it gets wierd, here's where Svab doesn't know what the hell he is talking about. I see he trying to jusitify the Erik Prince nonsene.   There is not a NYPD warrant and a FBI warrant.  There are two different FBI warrants.  The inspector general's report has an entire chapted about how the FBI needed a second warrant to look through the Huma/Clinton emails.   That is because the first warrant was looking for evidence of Weiner sexting with a 15 year old and possible others.   They could not look at emails that Weiner was not part of .

                  <p>
                   This guy even links to the second FBI warrant.......Notice that it also has SDNY all over it.    Because they are both Federal Warrants.

Do you not understand that they were working for the Trump campaign when they pushed this hoax?  Prince's role was not known at the time, but now it's come out he was doing secret missions for Trump that got his sister chosen at the Secretary of Education.

                   The story that Erik Prince pushed was the FBI took the laptop from the NYPD.  That's completely false and my claims are 100% vindicated by the unsealing of the original FEDERAL warrant to seize the laptop and the IG report which has an entire chapter about the Weiner laptop.  Chapter 9 if I remember correctly.

                    So yeah, you were right and I was wrong about the source of the second (or rather first) warrant.

                    But after acknowledging that you kicked my ass, I went and read the IG report. It took a while, hence my delay in replying.

                    I'm not going to try and mitigate this one. I missed some important details. But I will just say, there is a lot of self-pwnage in that report. I mean, holy crap, it's like there was a competition to see who could say "I don't remember" the most times.
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    I'm puzzling over the hack of QAnon right now, as well as thinking over what I read in the report. No idea when I'll post again, but I wanted to be a big boy and take my lumps on this.

                      Yes. I don't see any way that the NYPD could have had the laptop, since the IG report says that Weiner's attorney turned it over directly to the FBI.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                      On the other hand, I think the FBI's account of exactly what they did with the laptop once they had it is ... unsatisfying at best. No, that's too generous. The whole thing is a shitshow, particularly if you know anything about forensics. First they couldn't make an image of the contents. Then they made one, but erased it at some undisclosed date because of supposed security concerns. And of course that would have included the real-time record that forensic software makes of what sorts of analyses were done on the image as well, so now we only have the word of the agents involved. (The IG lamely says that the FBI still has the laptop itself. Oh, hooray!)
                     </p>
                     <p>
                      I will credit the IG for making a lot of things clear. I think whoever wrote the report knew they were being lied to quite a bit. But the IG doesn't come off as faultless either; I could list a dozen serious flaws in the report. For example, it mentions several times that a key motive of the investigation was to find emails from the first two months of Clinton's tenure as Secretary of State, as none of them were turned over. That was a justification for getting the second warrant, because the original agent assigned to study the laptop said (correctly) that given the sort of back-up that it was, it could conceivably contain every email from the beginning. But then after several hundred pages about recusal and text messages and other nonsense, the hasty review of the emails that Comey reported on Oct 28 is disposed of in a page and a half (388-389) and it never says whether any of the emails were from that period. Huh? Does that mean they didn't look, or that you didn't think to ask if they looked, or what?
                     </p>
                     <p>
                      As I say, I'm not trying to weasel out of getting the source of the first search warrant wrong. But I don't think the report is much of a victory for your side. Nobody comes off looking good. There's still plenty of room for leaks, misdirection, and malfeasance in that mess.

                       They had to make multiple images of the server.  They deleted it off somebody's personal work PC because knowingly putting classified material on a nonsecure computer is the
                       <em>
                        very thing they were looking into.
                       </em>
                       Clinton was not charged with a crime because she never intentionally did this.  She had no reason to expect people would be sending classified info to that account.  She was only receiving mail from nonsecure accounts there.  That account was not connected to SIPRNET, the secure system where she viewed fully classified documents.  She did not received any fully classifed documents in her personal email account.  What happened there was known as "spillage," the careless slipping of classified info into nonsecure emails/conversations/documents.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                       In this case, leaving this copy on nonsecure system would be knowingly leaving such information (if they found it) unprotected.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                       Part of what you are responding to is the onerous nature of such rules.  It's a big pain in the ass for everyone involved.  It's why "spillage" is as issue across the government - the documents with classified info were sent to Clinton from professional career foreign service workers, the white house, the CIA, the NSC and others.  Check out all the procedures related to spillage..

                   Yes, the FBI had the laptop.  They got from Weiner.  Weiner's lawyer arrainged for the hardware that was going to be seized to be turned over to a security firm, most likely so the subpoena would not be served at Weiner's home.   The FBI got his phone, his tablet and his laptop.  The NYPD did not.

                  <p>
                   The warrant makes this quite clear.   The IG report has an entire chapter on the possession of the laptop.  The NYPD is not mentioned at all.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   The story that the NYPD seized the laptop, found damning evidence and then the FBI yanked the laptop away is false.   It was a hoax.
