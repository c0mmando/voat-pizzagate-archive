            The men in the shower video are wearing hoods, so is the boy.

            The wipee video is also disturbing.

            Man in suit in background. Boy in fetal position on bed in foreground. He has agent orange on his side. Man in suit starts whiping it with a rag and then wiping it off aggressively as the child screams and writhes in pain. The sound is dulled.

            Nice try darkmathsadist. I can tell you also went to the Hillary Clinton School of Bullshit where you learn to accuse your target of exactly the crime YOU'RE guilty of.
           </p>
           <p>
            Of course in this case you shilling is not a crime. It's just pathetic. You're taking money from child rapists and organ harvesters. It doesn't get much worse than that.

            Disturbing... I watched once, won't watch again but I thought in the very beginning you can see the boys butt turned around with his shorts pulled down in the shower through the arm of the guy sitting down. The guy sounds black, his voice and his hair looks frizzy (not being rude or derogatory here). This is NOT John Podesta, however, at one point there appears to be another guy sitting beside the black guy but he doesn't speak and I can't comment on him because you only see him briefly. My impression is this: the black guy is the trafficker, he probably is breaking him down before he is sold, he is mean then nice, it's telling when he says the kid has a nice body on him. My instinct says he is not a pedo, he is paid to hold and traffic the kid, break him down, put fear in him so he doesn't run. The dark shower, the water, the guys staring and talking with flashlights is a scare tactic. Why is the kid still allowed to wear his shorts in the shower, that to me is also telling me the trafficker is not a pedo himself, he is paid to do this. I could be entirely wrong, these are just my observations and thoughts. I also think this boy is a lot bigger and older than the previous kid in the shower. Same shower, different man and different boy, equally disturbing. FBI CIA don't seem to give two shits about this stuff reported, it's like we need people who know how to get the specific computer details of the video, location made if possible and we can go pay them a visit. FBI CIA don't seem to want to do jack shit. Imagine if these videos were played on MSM, the outrage of people wanting an investigation would they then open a file and get these assholes for these crimes?

            ETA: I made a couple more passes through the video, stopping and starting to the end. This does look like an actual bathroom, I see tile on the wall outside the shower door to the left, solid walls inside the shower, not clear like the box at CPP, and what looks like a soapdish maybe four feet up on the back wall of the shower. I don't think it's the same shower door as in the Fatherhood video, that one I'm remembering as sliding and this one is on hinges, might be a bifold. I agree that this could be an instance of trafficking. One use of the shower couId be because children might urinate in terror. I will modify this edit if / when I have anything to add.

            I decided to find the video I mentioned below. It might be archived somewhere, but here is the link:

            The video was done by Frank Winstead while he was Commissioner of the Advisory Neighborhood Commission for his neighborhood. There's a whole backstory that was uncovered about him, his neighborhood, and CPP that I checked into some months ago, it might also be archived somewhere, but here's his Google to put him in a bit of context:

            Just like many other people, I put a lot of time checking into PizzaGate and have familiarity with this part in particular. I was in the middle of reading this thread last night when I faded, which right there jams up my input. This looks to be a different event, the man's voice does sound slowed down, so who know's if it's Skippy-the-pig-slaughterer, the kid is bigger, sounds freaked out and it is very distressing to listen to, but not anywhere near as much as that little kid in the other video, although it might have the same impact at normal speed. I've only made a few passes through it, I hear the guy saying, "What are you screaming about?" and the kid saying "...(inaudible to me)...you might drown me," which suggests the kid knows what's up, especially if he has been around previous, similar events. I read that kids are forced to watch / participate in Satanic rituals to give them the message they could be next, to keep them from talking.
           </p>
           <p>
            I was following PG on another website when the Fatherhood video first popped up. Some tech-type person used a voice comparison app on the voice in the video and John Podesta, which had an incredibly high percentage match, but I can't remember the number, so I won't unintentionally misquote. At one point the "shower" was tentatively identified as a large clear case on a stage with a drumkit in it at Comet Ping Pong, also pointed out was the same color strobe effect in the Fatherhood video and one of the Majestic Ape videos, but there's water involved here. If that case is still at CPP, somebody could check to see if it has a drain. People sitting around being "entertained" at such an "event" could possibly fit in that venue.
           </p>
           <p>
            This reminds me of that video the town commissioner, or some such title, made of the outside of CPP where you could hear what sounded like a little girl crying help / help me, while two guys out front played ping pong. The videographer / commissioner had objected years before PizzaGate to that ping pong table out front, and some of us PG investigators thought it was being used to distract away from what was going on inside, which fits with what's in that old video. You can actually see people looking around as they walk by, while the guys in front give the impression everything is okie-dokie, so they just continue walking.
           </p>
           <p>
            And the kid might be right, drowning or another way, which could make this a video of the first part of a human/child sacrifice (which means we are not seeing the rest, thankfully), where feelings of terror are intentionally created in the victim as he is forced into a shower to be washed down in preparation (and any physical remnants later washed down the drain or more easily collected),  with the lights disorienting him and making him unable to see, all frightening circumstances which cause a flood of those biochemicals in him that I read give the cannibals drinking the blood and eating the flesh of a victim some specific rush. Or it's just a bunch of mentals scaring a kid, you decide.
           </p>
           <p>
            I've read elsewhere that there "used to be" giants that ate human beings, there's supposed to be history handed down by Indians in the US (hey, I'm also part Indian and have no PC needs :) ), and were eventually hunted down and killed off. I'm not talking Sasquatch, but I don't really know how that fits in. There were giants all over the planet, one story says the aliens that made us caused the Great Flood to get rid of them, they were a product of inbreeding between aliens and the locals and causing major problems.
           </p>
           <p>
            People on this continent were finding buried remains of giants all the time, and the minute it got reported, those "elite" from the Smithsonian Institute would swoop in and claim them, never to be seen again, reportedly stored in the basement there. But that doesn't mean you have to be tall to be a cannibal (sounds like song lyrics).
           </p>
           <p>
            These body snatchers have been around forever. Anybody who says 3 letters will do anything are either paid consultants, need to do more homework, or are wearing a hat two sizes too small. It very much looks like some faction leaking stuff, and when I read FBIanon, he was obviously saying they couldn't do anything about it, pointed in certain directions and said to go there, and said it's on us to wake people up.

            We live in a system which keeps us enslaved by keeping our energy levels low. It first starts to rule over regional territory and its endgame is global domination. So its not just human beings, its an conscious ideology which exists on its own.
            <br/>
            Layers upon layers of distraction by bad news, confrontation, corruption, hatred, death and so on. False flags here and there. We feel low when we hear, see or read that..we divide ourselfs as one human race. Thats beautiful for the satanic agenda given that the no.1 rule is your Ego.
           </p>
           <p>
            If human/child trafficking truly makes the highest profit on this planet, how does it come that it doesnt get the TRUE attention that it deserves? How does it come that people around me rather talk about irrelevant topics such as a fucking sports game, elections, low level corruption and think they know how the system works? No its just there to keep you asleep and cruise as a mask of whatever you want to be on the surface of illusion.
           </p>
           <p>
            Lets take the Seth Rich video about election: when you see him moving and talking, you get a different sense of the situation than just reading about him. Same goes with horrific stories which you just read; If you would watch a video of a small child, ripped away from its family to be part of the sick fantasies of deeply demonic people. If you would see, how they slowly torture it and the child screams in agony, reaching for its mother, just seeing darkness and laughing elders surrounding him...no hope, no way out, no love in sight but pure evil.. and you see this one beautiful soul who would smile at any stranger, cause love is whats whithin him, slowly die.. If the world would see those kind of stuff and truly understand the nature of it, there would be a revolution over night.

            Oh God the last one was so horrible.  It's far from debunked.  Whether it is actually John Podesta in the video is in question. But that poor kid sounds to be genuinely in distress. Not acting imo.  I do not even want to click on this one ...

             ok so I watched it, most of it, and clearly in one part he is telling the kid to take a shower.  FBI definitely needs to seize this domain and all server logs, find out who uploaded the video from where and have a long talk with that person.

             I'm watching as well right now, it's pretty hard to stomach. I would like to know how/why they developed these "techniques", I mean, they seem to be doing certain things very deliberately, like flashing the strobelight. I know "MKUltra" would be the easy answer, but still...

              I heard that is was done through voice modulators, and isn't really a kid. I dunno. I used to believe 100%, but now I do think we're being played.

            Totally. Since I've already been disturbed with it, I'm going to make a transcript of it with 100% of words spoken and post it for others who can't watch.

             I haven't watched, but when you say, "many times in this one place..."  Do you think the "one place" could be Tony's "torture chamber"?  Why the authorities have not busted his home doors down with a search warrant after T. Podesta's personal confession of "...still being in the torture chamber" is BS. Someone call the FBI, DOJ, who the hell is supposed to be in charge of these investigations?  The corrupted DC police?

               Feel free to find the guys making the videos. I would like to see that. And I've not seen anything about a hoax. Titus Frost got most of his information wrong in the video you sent me, you know that right? He's made up a bunch of things which don't fit and he thinks he debunked something he didnt. I can go over it with you if you want.
              </p>
              <p>
               Otherwise, it's really important that you understand, we are not talking about the Fatherhood video which you think is debunked.
              </p>

               As I stated previously there has been a new release.

                This was very painful to watch. For those saying it is debunked I challenge them to prove it. You can clearly see a little boy with his shirt off standing in a shower of some type. Several men surround him with flashlights in his face and on his body. In slow motion one man says "you have a nice body" he then asks the boy to spin around. The child screams and moans repeatedly as they say what's your problem you don't want to take a shower and laugh.
               </p>
               <p>
                It made me nauseous. Don't call it debunked unless you can bear to watch this sickening reality. For some reason this is getting leaked these monsters don't stop at showers.

                posted that they might be leaking parts of the tapes that show the emotional torture to keep the pressure and public outrage going. The rest would be illegal to leak and would cause civil war.

            My suspicion is that FBI insiders are releasing parts of this video - if it is Podesta - in order to send a message.  Like RDS and GW I think the white hats don't want to arrest these people...just want em to stop.  However they won't stop so this will continue to escalate.

             think about it. If Trump/sessions had podesta arrested tomorrow on paedophilia/human trafficking, the media would say its a baseless political witch-hunt. What trump/sessions need is a million voices on the internet screaming 'we told you this for months now, this arrest is legit!!'

              But the media will lie and spin regardless of how many is watching. We need to abandon the MSM and stop letting them have an influence on what is important for the government to investigate or discuss.

               But see, here's the VALUE of these worldcorpo videos. They explicitly show emotional abuse of a minor - and that is not illegal to share in the public domain. The big block we have in this movement is that even if you had a glaring hi definition video of hillary clinton raping and murdering a 6 yr old girl - who can you show that to? how can you distribute it? who will re-post it without being in jeopardy of arrest themselves?
              </p>
              <p>
               The fantastic thing about these worldcorpo vids -disgusting and harrowing as they are - is that the form of abuse within is NOT illegal to distribute yet still raises JUST AS MUCH OUTRAGE and awareness as would a clear cut paedo snuff film.
              </p>
              <p>
               And THATS what makes me think there's something to the suggestion that there's some strategic thing going on in their release

             I watched.....and it is truly horrifying. I couldn't make out a lot of what was said or done, though. If anyone has seen a transcript of the dialogue I'd be interested in reviewing that. I don't think I can watch it again.

             It is very sick. I'll describe it briefly and without too much detail. it is a different angle of the shower stall. A boy child is inside it and men are pointing flashlights at him, or one flashlight. They are screaming at him and he's wailing in terror. One of the men says to him, "you've got a nice body on you" and the child starts to weep and they scream at him more and he's terrified. They close the door to the shower and bang on it like in the Fatherhood video. They work him up to terror then tell him he needs to relax. Then they freak him out again, and then laugh and tell him to relax. Then one man says, "I like this kid" to one of the other men as the child is still screaming and freaking out.
            </p>
            <p>
             It's fucking horrifying.

             I just watched that and a few more that are horrifying, it isn't gore, just the obviousness of people trying to drive people to as much terror as possible. Nightmare stuff and one involves a child, more than we saw before..:(

Thank you for taking the hit for the rest of us, watching it, and giving us the info.  God bless you and everyone investigating this awful situation.

             Why do you care if he/she alerts the FBI if you believe Worldcorp is a troll? I'm still unsure of the purpose behind Worldcorp, but the information that OP gave us is helpful for the people who don't follow Worldcorp daily, especially if it is pertaining to child abuse.

                1) The FBI

                2) The local law enforcement in that town in New Jersey sheilaAliens discovered they were posting from. Look it up on youtube.
               </p>
               <p>
                3) The New Jersey State Police.

                If you think a crime is being committed then call local Law Enforcement. SheilaAliens traced them to an IP in New Jersey. I don't remember the town. You can find her post though on youtube.
               </p>
               <p>
                You can also call the New Jersey State Police. They have no choice but to respond.

                 It is them posting this crap. Remember when Nypd said "if the FBI wasn't going to do anything about Weiners hard drive they would." Well I think they did, this way. Besides there isn't anything posted online that they don't know about, especially with the attention these videos have gotten.

                   My point is I think it is law enforcement is posting this crap, and it's a CIA dark project, testing torture or chemicals. Notice the bag over the kids head. I could be wrong but I just can't believe its a troll job.  There is a whole bunch of sound tracks of music included to, so my next thought is, do trolls pay for studio time to make music to pull off these hoaxes?  But Darkmath I have to say I respect many of your comments and you could be right. But pictures that surface on someone's blog  with no sources, don't make them factual either. Maybe those 2 people were connected to this stuff, who knows.

                    That's all the more reason to call in to the New Jersey State Police. They would take offense at people from the CIA abusing kids in New Jersey.

                     Yes I am going to dig today get as much info as I can and do that. Unfortunately I lost my hearing a few days ago and it hasn't returned due to pneumonia, but I will figure something out.
I found this interesting article about the girl.

                      Mind you I think it's a troll so I don't think you should call. But YOU THINK IT"S REAL and I'm just suggesting if you think it's real then you should call law enforcement to make your conscience feel better.

                         Yes. It seems the sister doesn't seem to believe their original story on her sisters death. Please note the girl was a runner, &amp; her sister is from Virginia to. She says media and law enforcement were sketchy and not forthcoming sounds familiar . The dna testing failed the first time. The 2 men convicted said "they were tortured into a confession." The dna on the Hoe was slim to none.
 Podesta has Mandarin emails which picture 2 little boys with Pandas, that fit what we see of the kids in the shower. The same individual sends quite a few more pics of children to. One is in a pamper, one looks quite terrified, this is just a guess their is at least 10 kids or more in those 24 emails, plus I suspect data hidden in them as well but I am not that savy.
