<p>TL;DR: Young woman who worked with Carribean kids after hurricane Thomas ravaged Haiti, returns to US. Volunteers with US child charities. Mysteriously hit by train. Suspected to have been placed on tracks. Same judge Cinderela Guevara who declared Justice Scalia death &quot;natural causes&quot; rules this one a &quot;suicide&quot;. Family disagrees. Body creamated immediately à la Scalia, against family wishes</p>
<p>I hope someone with much better investigative / writing skills than me can dig down this rabbit hole because, there is way too much for me to handle properly and give it the vetting it deserves.</p>
<p>This is her brave mother telling the story from her perspective:

<p>Her family believes she was murdered, but an immediate determination of &quot;suicide&quot; was made by Judge Cinderela Guevara before any investigation was done. Did not order a rape kit or an autopsy. No one has explained why.

<p>Judge Cinderela Guevara is the same judge who pronounced Justice Scalia dead, over the phone, based only on information communicated by those at the ranch. Declared natural causes &quot;no autopsy required&quot;.

<p>The cast of characters we dealt with are notable. Rod Ponton represented Glyn Robert Chambers in 1992, the co-defendant and confidential informant of former Presidio County Sheriff Rick Thompson, who was arrested for transporting a ton of cocaine in a sheriff horse trailer. He is now serving a life sentence. Mr. Ponton won election as District Attorney narrowly in a Democratic primary. He is also the Texas DA that refuses to reopen a case in Fort Stockton, Texas, where a woman named Sonia J. Cacy was convicted with outdated forensic science of murdering her uncle in 1993 by arson. Mr. Ponton has asked Attorney General Gregg Abbott (yes, that Gregg Abbott) to assist in blocking a reopening of the case. He has his own criminal past. There are stories that he starves his horses, stories that he has a past of sexual assaults that have never been prosecuted, and other lurid rumors. When his name is mentioned, people use words like snake and scum. I have heard many people say, &quot;If Rod Ponton is speaking, he\'s lying.&quot;  
</p>
<p>Ponton\'s Investigator, Kevin Ficke, was convicted of tampering with evidence while employed with the Uvalde Sheriff Department in 1992, and served four years probation. He sued Hays County for wrongful termination after quitting because the Hays County DA questioned his credibility, and lost(pdf). Interestingly, his wife was charged in Guadalupe County for forging prescriptions before he accepted the position in west Texas. It appears this led to the closure and eviction of a non-profit children\'s shelter they were running.</p>

            Last comment posted on DemocraticundergroundI now believe it was suicide by train. Her mother's words have lifted me up, which seems so back-assward 'cause I have that feeling I should be lifting her up. I hope they lift you, too, I hope they lift up all who read them. This is what Liz, her mama wrote:

            She rode into the sunset on the tail of the Comet Swift-Tuttle. As her memorial service ended and the crowd had barely begun to move themselves, a glowing light appeared rising from the sunset and continu...ed far into the east. It was something that no one had ever seen, like a tower of light, a cloud so vast that it traveled beyond the earth's atmosphere towards the sun.
           </p>
           <p>
            The days since she passed have had cool breezes that blow short showers through the landscape, leaving rainbows all over the countryside. Everyone has remarked about it. And then last night as the memorial service ended, the beautiful sunset was suddenly over and a wide band of light appeared from the sunset. The earth was passing by the tail of the Comet Swift-Tuttle, which creates the Pleiades meteor showers in August. It last passed near the Earth in 1992, and is expected to be seen again in 2125.

            Of course she would leave on the tail of a comet, she was always an overachiever. I have thought that she was saying, "This is what I can do in my cosmic form." I have thought that she was needed elsewhere, regardless of our wishes here in this life. She had to go, as my son said, because her beautiful soul was needed on a galactic mission, perhaps in another realm. You could believe that of Melaney.
           </p>
           <p>
            The moment could not have been all coincidence. Everyone has been grieving here, and at that moment, everyone's hearts were lifted. There was too much magic. Bill started talking about it to me in Fort Davis and sounded more shaken by it than he wanted to be.

            Her husband, John, is comforted. Maybe she felt she had to knock us over the head with a miracle, or more likely, a rare scientific event, so we might understand she was sending us a sign as loud as she could. She was heading off to the stars.
           </p>
           <p>
            But I am still numb. And I miss her.See More

            what do you mean by shill?  To me a shill is someone who tries to deliberately shut down or redirect a line of inquiry.  I may most definitely be mistaken, wrong, even nuts, but I never intentionally attempt to derail.   I could certainly improve my research and be a little less lunatic in my observations, and I will do so in future, but I am not a shill.  You are going out of your way to try to repress me and others and it makes you seem a little shilly.  Why don't you do more research and let the mods mod?

            I tried searching some history on this Judge Guevara, but there is very little.  I think it will take access to local Texas papers to look at her ruling history.  You can find a few pdfs of local papers, but fairly banal stuff.  Probably some kind of access to court records in Texas will be needed.  I tried to concentrate searches for prior to 2015, back as far as 2000.  Maybe local library sources in Texas?

            The first thing that hit me was why would a newly wed husband let his young wife who had been drinking, walk home alone after midnight from a bar in a border town?  I know the article says "it was their thing" but it still sounds weird to me. The second thing that hit me was, why was this husband pushing for her to be cremated when there was obvious foul play (she had not committed suicide) and they did not have any autopsy results?

            Britian's top lawyer, John Jones QC, who represented Assange also 'suicided' under a train.  I thought it interesting that he had stated that certain words 'triggered' him. His treating psychiatrist, Dr Periera, has a lot of answer for, as does the hospital where he was being treated.
           </p>
           <p>
            <em>
             Mr Jones was reluctant to open up because there were certain things he didn’t want to talk about and was convinced he would be “banished from the world” if he did, and that he felt “caught between the devil and the deep blue sea”.
Mr Jones told Dr Pereira there were certain “trigger” words and films he had seen, any mention of which would set off his negative thought patterns.

            I don't think unlikely at all. If they can explain away Seth Rich and get away with it so easily, orchestrating an explainable JA death-by-Pizzagater, with inevitable MSM support, would be a piece of cake and would advance the almighty "fake news" agenda. Someone way, way up "there" must really want, or need, JA. At least for now. (Heya James, watch yur 6, cause they're watching you, while they're watching us.)

            Nope nothing to see here. Great work!! I wonder just how many coincidences it takes for somebody to do something. Hopefully after 1/20 it will be.

             Her husband was about 30 minutes behind her still at the bar.  So I think they were waiting for her.  If he were the target they would have just waited longer.  She was killed less than 15 minutes after leaving the bar so I feel it was a specific target.

            You're not kidding about the Clinton body bags.  This is somewhat off topic so I won't side track too much here, but I remember reading about some of my first modern conspiracies (non jfk/moon landing) online about the deaths tied to the Clintons early in the Bush II years

             Yeah this is false. There is a reason the Catholic Church was chosen for infiltration around Vatican II. You need to do some more research on Catholicism deeper than the embedded pedos as of late. I am a Catholic and have challenged my faith. I came back because of the loads of observable corroborated miracles like Fatima 1917, the tilma of Guadalupe, various Eucharistic miracles, as well as the writings of the early Church (The ante-Nicean fathers - first three centuries), who wrote about the Church is a decidedly Catholic tone when dealing with the Bishop as Pope, the Eucharist as literal body and blood, liturgical practices, etc.

                The eucharist which appears to be heart muscle didn't have more rigorous tests performed, for example determining the sex and the genetic heritage.

                Naturalistic explanations are more probable than miraculous ones.

                Other religions have the same sort of miracles.

               <p>
                Why would god perform a miracle to the faithful who already have faith, but not to the faithless? If he wanted, he could make his miracles louder and bigger and more certain to all.

                 Mass Hallucination is less likely than a miracle. For a miracle to be shown true all you have to do is show an outside force intervened in the laws of nature. Much like the unlikelihood of a card being guessed after being pulled from a deck of cards one merely needs just show the card for proof. If you can't get behind 70,000+ including hard core skeptics seeing the event (which destroys mass hallucination) and the clothes being dried then you are not familiar enough with epistemology. The sun not moving in other locations has nothing to do with a miracles in a particular location, which was also PRE-ANNOUNCED. The vision could have been sun-like and is easily amended/elaborated upon because it is much more likely something actually happened than the crowd was hallucinating. Here is the google image result for primary images of the event,

                 Just because there is not MORE evidence in the Eucharistic miracle does not take away from the strength of the tests a professional lab conducted. If you you more information you can contact the lab. I also would point out the consistence with blood type these miracles have with the shroud of Turin.

                <p>
                 On miracles and proof see my point above and the card analogy. They also do not violate natural laws as to always be less likely than naturalistic explanations. A miracle is God acting upon the causal natural system.

                 No other religion has the roots in history as the Judeo/Christian one. All others can only be shown as far as myth stories. As Tolkein said, Christianity is the only "true myth" insofar as it sounds like a myth story but actually has historical roots (I would reference Dr. Gary Habermas' minimal facts argument for the Resurrection where he uses only the data that around 95% of critical historians allow to make his inference,
                 <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ay_Db4RwZ_M">

                 </a>
                 ). Other outside miracles therefore would be on the demonic side given the unique and solid historical foundation of the Judeo/Christian and would be consistent within its framework.
                </p>
                <p>
                 Just because you do not like the evidence we have and want more/other does not take away from its strength. It only means we have no foundation for discussion

                   The only think worth replying to is that I do not need to show the "math" comparing two abductive arguments (mass hallucination versus an outside agent upon nature) because the issue on your end is an a prioi assumption that naturalistic explanations are always more likely than a miracle. It is a mistake to assume that because the presumed premise of God undermining natural law is false. God acts upon natural law as an agent.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   You do not like the evidence so you are attacking from behind assumptions (nature always being more viable) and lack of precise information not available (you can contact the lab that examined the host) as to not address the links. Check out Habermas when you have some time to kill. Keep up the pizzagate research.

                     I see from the deleted Voat link you sent me that you are truly a class act. This will be my last reply given what you have shown me.

                    <p>
                     Before we move to statistics, which is not required by an normal person in an informal online disagreement comparing two sets of data (mass hallucination versus outside agent acting on nature, where one merely needs to metaphorically show the guessed card as in my earlier analogy), we have the a prioi assumption of nature always overriding a miracle, which is a bad assumption. Moving on from there, hypothetically we can never establish a reference or baseline because you would never accept a miracle given the a prori assumption about naturalism. It would also be really difficult to show an established mass hallucination case where there are hard core skeptics present, so we end up coming back to an informal argument about two sets of data where you prefer to hurl insults.

            All these "minor" people being suicided honestly makes me wonder how James Alefantis is still alive.  He must have some pretty strong friendships up high, because his usefulness must be near gone at this point, he can't really do anything without a million eyes on him, so if he really a coordinator/handler for children, he Is essentially obsolete.  Seems like he is just a liability at this point...

             Thinking same thing; Alefantis seems closely connected to Obama who will be moving on, but to what?
Obama has rented house two doors down from Tony Podesta's house.
             <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/26/us/politics/obama-kalorama-washington-house.html?_r=0">
              http://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/26/us/politics/obama-kalorama-washington-house.html?_r=0
             </a>
             Obama also purchased a "Mansion in Dubai" last January
President Barack Obama purchased a mansion for $4.9 million in Dubai, United Arab Emirates (UAE).
            </p>
            <p>
             The mansion was bought in early January 2016 by the Podesta Group.
Not a website friendly to Obama, but further down read:  Rear Admiral Richard Williams, Jr. was fired for leaking that Obama bought a mansion in Dubai, UAM, a non-extradition country and then is accused of "reading pornography while on duty."

             In that search, up popped this from reddit which guess might have made it to Voat?
John and Tony Podesta's mother adopted 25 kids after moving to Washington

               I don't necessarily think so. They could decide to throw him under the bus (train) or pull a Craig Spence on him.Being high profile has not always stopped them

               One would have to think he has something like this. I mean it's a super dangerous game, and if he is the point man for peddling all this filth, he'd totally have the goods to also bury people.

               Only problem with it is that's assuming the good guys in the feds would be willing to take on the case.

               From what FBIAnon was saying, they have the dirt already and there is plenty to convict a large portion of the gov't, however, until it's more widely accepted as truth in the kangaroo court of public opinion, their hands are more or less tied.

                I know we have seen all this circumstantial evidence, and more and more it looks like FBIAnon info checks out, but even now I am having trouble wrapping my head around how ingrained this could be at high levels.  Absolutely insane to me.  Yet, Occam's Razor, on many subjects it feels like that is the obvious answer.

               Yes, that's what I mean, no doubt he has lots of goods on them as well a deadman switch. But I think more than that, he's one of them not just a peripheral player.

               Whenever it gets too hot, they might prosecute "one of them" but these ones always get off with a slap on the wrist at worst. Look at the ridiculous sentence that sick pedophile Epstein got. And another sick creep, if anybody remembers that aspens guy Scooter Libby his crime didn't have to do with children but he was one of the in crowd too. His joke sentence was commuted by Bush so he didn't even see a day in jail.
              </p>
              <p>
               BTW Libby wrote a book full of pedophilia and other depravity.

             Assange's leading lawyer's was killed by train in October in UK.

            <p>
             Later, threats to Julian Assange and his still living lawyer came via emails from allegedly a T&amp;C dating service which appeared to be trying to entrap him, including to push false charges/rumors about him -- and seemed to originate from many connected to Clinton Campaign.  (I know the investigation is here/will look for link in archives)
