            If you've ever been surveilled and knew it - you would understand a few things about Webb. He recently (within the last 2 weeks) touched on some stuff that he knew was dangerous - he's developed paranoia that Robert DeNiro couldn't act off in his heyday.  If you figure out that George Webb studied classical acting as a child and spent 20 years with the CIA I might believe he's a fraud.  As of right now, from his videos, he's under stress and cracking daily. It's kind of sad because he deserves protection ... And we just sit around waiting for him to tell us what happens next.  If you saw his trello videos a couple days ago you know either he tried to false flag the powers that be or the powers outed him by showing his real name in the video. It's weird. Draw your own conclusion.

            Important conversation, guys. Yes the FBI likely has 10x the evidence this community does, and so awareness is our primary priority imo. You are right, though, that societies fabric would be torn apart of the enormity and nature of it were fully known overnight 9/11 style.

            However, paedophilia is a virulent crime - victims become perps, 2nd, 3rd 4th generation brownstone op survivors now creating independent rings and communities with little or no ties to the establishment. So to lop off a few tentacles here and there will not stop the cancer from growing - the public MUST BE MADE AWARE OF THE CONNECTION :   Power from Loyalty from witnessed Depravity
           </p>
           <p>
            The little people of the world must put everyone on notice: if you are in a position of power you are automatically under suspicion of paedophilia - and that must be a sentiment that prevails for 2 generations at least.

             I feel completely horrible saying this ... But the Russians do it too.  That's why there is a pizzagate cover-up from the CIA to the media. We have to continue to be in the market of making spies ... And the sure fire way to create truly dependable spies is from birth or under 8 yrs old. The satanic organ-harvesting blood drinking bullshit has to stop - but we will always steal children and convert them into spies as long as other countries do it. It's fucked up stuff. The spies brought up since birth are the #1 intelligence weapon in the U.S.  The former spec ops military guys doing mass shooting sprees are the expendable ones.

              I disagree. These spies-from-birth  are a liability. They damage the social fabric, they cause as much or more acrimony with other nations than they prevent, their sense of morality is so distorted their judgements are only ever accidentally in the interest of We The People.

            As far as strategies go, I think some here in the comments have it just about perfect: infiltrate! Our investigative powers would multiply exponentially if we had just a few of 'our own' here go and take some of those jobs. Hell, I think humanity in general would benefit from this strategy. Infiltrate, embed, collect info, spread disinfo, report back to internet.

              My reply above says it right... if you apply, they'll look at you so close, they'll be poking your brain through your rectum... IP record matching, data packet sniffing, internet history.. remember, if you post to FaceBook and here with the same IP, your provider (and at least one server farm under the Pentagon) has records of you posting to both FaceBook and Voat from the same IP..
Best to have someone outside of Voat/not involved with PizzaGate (ideally as far removed as possible)

               I'm starting to think DynCorp is going to take the fall for all of it. Feinberg will get immunity for ignorance of the situation and whoever runs it will flee.  There will be horrible crimes and accusations, but they will take the fall for it.  Honestly, the CIA is operating within their limits (which there may be no limits) but they do have to harvest kids for their spy program - so they're status quo.  The Clinton foundation may get dusted which is fine, but after that - we may be able to function instead of putting 300 elected officials in prison.  They were blackmailed anyways - we can vote them out if it's that serious.

            Evil people absolutely exist but they certainly don't all work for specific companies. I'm not saying that's what you're implying, but a lot of uneducated people here do hold that belief. There are pedos that work for dyncorp, McDonalds, the government, the YMCA and every other company with more than a handful of employees.

            Edit- heh highest rated comment compares dyncorp to hydra. Point made.

            Here's the thing with that, if you buy into the FBIAnon ama's, then you already know that the proper authorties already have more than enough evidence to bury the clinton's and their co-conspirators and lock them up for the rest of their miserable lives. But at this point, no one will indict or press charges because that'd be like charging Saddam or Khaddafi at the height of their power. It just wouldn't happen.
           </p>
           <p>
            For this to happen, we have to:
           </p>
           <p>
            -First raise awareness into the problem
           </p>
           <p>
            -Get it more widely accepted by the masses
           </p>
           <p>
            -Then we might see some charges handed down
           </p>
           <p>
            Last thing i'll say, I'm not too confident how we will put this plan into practice; as FBIAnon also said, it's become a matter of national security. If and when this story really breaks, the ripple effect could be catastrophic.

            Oh shit, since it's meta? My bad, lurker and investigator for some time, but really haven't posted much. I think you might be right.

            Well, I suppose the mods will remove it if they feel so inclined. I'm just glad I was able to start a small conversation.

            In the future I will pay more attention to the rules. I mean there's only 4, right? Embarrassing.

            Exactly! Just commented that same thing above in the thread^ Saw that and thought about throwing my name in the hat, just to see. Also in the IT field and although there's a 0% chance I'd drop everything and go to the middle east for my next posting, I'm still curious about the details and the process.

            If you were serious about following up with them, at least you know going into it that'd you be working for evilcorp.

            Come on guys -- anything Dyncorps is of interest. OP gave a valid source -- Dyncorp's advertising for hires. Things can get more speculative in the comments. We're investigatiing, but also analysing, speculating, brain-storming: building the case.

            Pizzagate is a smaller piece to the bigger picture that he is investigating.
           </p>
           <p>
            He said in a video a couple weeks ago that he was in contact with active and inactive FBI, which I believe is where he's getting some of his information, or confirmations. I'm not sure how much of this is about pizzagate specifically, or about trafficking in general, but he's only mentioned Comet Ping Pong in the past couple days.
           </p>
           <p>
            He's also explained why it's important to tell the whole thing in pieces. There are so many moving parts that no one would ever be able to follow what he's talking about if he didn't go slow. I was so lost for the fist week or two of watching his videos, but like a lot of people, I now am familiar with who's who.

           <p>
            the guy is batshit crazy in some respects, sure, and I clearly flagged it to be taken with a grain of salt. But what contribution to the cause does this forum make if we disallow the voices of  intentionally psychologically damaged people ?

            ANY company w govt contracts has govt NDA's. Most people will say "ya but if I saw such-n-such going on I'd be a whistleblower". You'd think that until you are threatened or your family is threatened. Also, there are plants in MSM so that if you called and tried to blow whistle on something they turn around and report you.

             I believe this to be true. There is just too much at stake to just welcome strangers into this criminal family and spill all the beans on them without some kind of serious insurance policy involved. With the gov't contracts hanging in the balance, I'm sure you'd be silenced before you got a chance to blow the whistle if you made the wrong move while playing that game.

             Great, the first real negative comment! I knew that'd come, so thanks for that.

            given the  voat 'sleeper mod' spaz-out delete-fest that occurred when this community first cottonned on to Dyncorp, i would take a VERY dim view of any mod shutting down enquiry into Dyncorp however speculative

            It feels like we're really close to connecting Edgar Maddison Welch to the Dyncorp false flags via Haiti, based on Webb's videos but I haven't seen anyone post on it yet.

            <em>

            recently connected Comet Ping Pong to the bigger Haiti picture, so maybe we're close enough?

             Which is interesting unto itself because Webb has been in this game a long time; dude is the equivalent of a grizzled old war vet when it comes to digging into this stuff and really drilling down deep in there. But he's said time and time again that he didn't want to specifically focus on the #pg or human trafficking stuff, but it's clear to pretty much all parties that there is a TON of overlap with the gov't/cf corruption and the whole Braverman storyline.
            </p>
            <p>
             Would be amazing if all this digging could produce some kind of so called, "smoking gun".

            I'm guessing there's a lot of compartmentalization involved. Teams within teams that rarely see what the other is doing. I also believe this is how a real life Secret Space Program could operate.
           </p>
           <p>
            Also, knowing what we know, seeing job openings for Dyncorp is not unlike seeing job openings for Hydra. Surreal.

             With all of these insane investigations going on over here, it's nice to see this post wasn't a complete waste of time.

              I had similar thoughts the other day, looking at implicated companies and their job listings. I wonder what it would be like, going for a job a Dyncorp, knowing what you know now. It made me wonder also about an old job I had, at a place that had a lot of interaction with some of the people and companies/organisations that have cropped up in this investigation. It's very good I no longer work there as I would have probably been tempted to go snooping or something and ended up getting myself in some kind of trouble.
             </p>
             <p>
              But I get the impression that the VAST majority of staff at any of these half legit/half criminally insane places have absolutely no clue that they are rubbing shoulders with arch pedophile slave-driving drug smuggling sociopathic war criminals.

            There would be a lot to be learned by courageous researchers obtaining employment under cover in these corporations. This is going to be a long battle. Also in obtaining testimony of former employees.

             Thing to keep in mind... if you even applied at someplace like Dyncorp, immediately, the first thing they do is look into you... very, very deep, due to their ties to government.  If you think getting a job at Microsoft requires a clean record... this place expects you to be surgically clean, and they'll look deeper than you might think, down to subpoenaing your IP records (and finding you post on here and Facebook about/against them, simply by data packet sniffing and IP matching).
If you have someone outside of the Voat circle (remember, for the love of God and KEK, don't post a name here), that you can trust, maybe they could look into that angle, but just remember, if Dyncorp (haven't been following that part of the mess lately... damn job hunt) is as involved as I've been seeing mentioned, if your friend got themselves caught, it's possible they might be disappeared.

              Ha! They already have your ip records. They are the faction of the CIA that allows the CIA to operate on domestic soil. Don't go applying for a dyncorp job if you have a login ID to voat.

             Great idea, the old long con. I saw some of the helpdesk/network engineer positions and I had half a mind to throw my name in the hat just to see if they would give me a look. But apparently they are looking for janitors, cooks and barbers... To go to fucking AFGHANISTAN!? Who tf would do that? Unbelievable.
