<p><strong>Comet Pizza</strong> is a pizza place owned by <strong>James Alefantis</strong>, who is the former gay boyfriend of <strong>David Brock</strong>, the CEO of <strong>Correct The Record</strong>. It has been the venue for dozens of events for the Hillary campaign staff. <strong>John Podesta</strong> has had campaign fundraisers there for both Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton. John\'s brother and business partner <strong>Tony Podesta</strong> has his birthday party there every year.
&nbsp;</p>
<p>It\'s also a dive that according to reviews and photos has hidden bathroom doors and creepy murals. The bathrooms in particular have murals exclusively of nude women, as well as a great deal of graffiti relating to sex. Reviews of the restaurant are bizarrely polarized. Websites describing it positively note that there are regularly &quot;unsupervised children running around&quot;. Their menu include a pedophilic symbol, as do the signs and decorations of other neighboring businesses.

<p>The music acts and the posters promoting same acts are bizarre in their presentation, content, and lyrical focus, but are still promoted as being &quot;for all ages&quot;. The overtly sexual content would suggest otherwise.
The same has taken place in reference to videos recorded inside Comet Ping Pong by people that frequent their establishment as well as video referencing Comet Ping Pong positively from the exterior.
While initially not the central focus of the investigation at the onset, Comet Ping Pong is a much more overt and much more disturbing hub of coincidences. Everyone associated with the business is making semi-overt, semi-tongue-in-cheek, and semi-sarcastic inferences towards sex with minors. The artists that work for and with the business also generate nothing but cultish imagery of disembodiment, blood, beheadings, sex, and of course pizza.

<p>Comet Ping Pong owned by James Alefantis, once listed 49th &quot;most influential&quot; person in DC by GQ:

<p>James Alefantis\' instagram late 11/5/16. by morning of 11/7/16 it was set to private.
&nbsp;</p>
<p>We recently found the instagram account of James Alefantis. The contents of it are indescribably bizarre and the contexts of the posts and comment chains are weird. Alefantis does not have any children nor do his closest associates, but the photos seem to be a near constant assortment of different children of a variety of ages, intermingled between posts about gay bars, clubs, photos of common rape drugs, and piles of foreign currency. After it being trawled through for 24 hours it has been set to private. A large set of archived copies can be seen here in the next section. Similarly the instagram and twitter accounts of Comet Ping Pong are being edited selectively. The accounts of the people favoriting and commenting on these posts are equally bizarre in both content, context, and demeanor.

<p><strong>Tony Podesta</strong>
&nbsp;</p>
<p>Tony Podesta, John Podesta\'s brother and the guy who has a &quot;pasta&quot; obsession according to many e-mails did a 3 to 4 month trip to Japan with <strong>Dennis Hastert</strong> where they both taught students.
In his first year of graduate school, Hastert spent three months in Japan as part of the People to People Student Ambassador Program.[29] One of Hastert\'s fellow group members was Tony Podesta (then the president of the Young Democrats at University of Illinois at Chicago Circle).
&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hastert admitted to molesting kids when he did work as a teacher.

<p>Tony Podesta still keeps in regular contact with Hastert.

<p>Tony Podesta has a &quot;Huge&quot; vault underneath his house
&nbsp;</p>
<p>They are known for purchasing &quot;awkward&quot; works, such as video installations, that many other private collectors will not consider. &quot;It\'s easy to store them, but difficult to display them,&quot; says Podesta. To get round the problem, he and his wife have excavated a huge subterranean vault beneath their house outside Washington - a white space 5m square and 4m high in which it will be possible to show &quot;very complicated video pieces&quot; on all four walls.

&nbsp;</p>
<p>Folks attending a house tour in the Lake Barcroft neighborhood in Falls Church earlier this year got an eyeful when they walked into a bedroom at the Podesta residence hung with multiple color pictures by <strong>Katy Grannan</strong>, a photographer known for documentary-style pictures of naked teenagers in their parents\' suburban homes.
&quot;They were horrified,&quot; Heather recalls, a grin spreading across her face.

          </p>
          <p>
           We recently found the instagram account of James Alefantis. The contents of it are indescribably bizarre and the contexts of the posts and comment chains are weird. Alefantis does not have any children nor do his closest associates, but the photos seem to be a near constant assortment of different children of a variety of ages, intermingled between posts about gay bars, clubs, photos of common rape drugs, and piles of foreign currency. After it being trawled through for 24 hours it has been set to private. A large set of archived copies can be seen here in the next section. Similarly the instagram and twitter accounts of Comet Ping Pong are being edited selectively. The accounts of the people favoriting and commenting on these posts are equally bizarre in both content, context, and demeanor.

            Dennis Hastert
           </strong>
           where they both taught students.
In his first year of graduate school, Hastert spent three months in Japan as part of the People to People Student Ambassador Program.[29] One of Hastert's fellow group members was Tony Podesta (then the president of the Young Democrats at University of Illinois at Chicago Circle).

          <p>
           They are known for purchasing "awkward" works, such as video installations, that many other private collectors will not consider. "It's easy to store them, but difficult to display them," says Podesta. To get round the problem, he and his wife have excavated a huge subterranean vault beneath their house outside Washington - a white space 5m square and 4m high in which it will be possible to show "very complicated video pieces" on all four walls.

            Where the hell do I start with this? Basically I think We The Pizza (who have ties to David Brocks Correct The Record) are involved in child prostitution. Here's a rundown on how I came to this conclusion.
           </p>
           <p>
            The beginning:
            <strong>
             Does anybody have this archived?
            </strong>
            It was posted on Reddit
            <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/pizzagate">
             r/pizzagate
            </a>
            and I'm struggling to summarize it from memory.
The original We The Pizza thread that broke on Reddit had 2 users claiming they were able to break into We The Pizza's computers somehow and make off with 2 GB of CP and a
            <a href="https://i.sli.mg/Fp3Q1T.jpg">
             program that is distributed to their customers which gives a price list etc
            </a>
            . They were supposedly tipped off by a friend who worked for a 3 letter agency. OP actually leaked a few CP pictures which a handful of users clicked on and downloaded before the subreddit admins deleted the links.
            <strong>
             An hour or so after this story leaked www.wethepizza.com went down and only displayed 'Coming Soon'.
            </strong>
           </p>
           <p>
            A number of hours after their website went down it resurfaced but I noticed a page had disappeared www.wethepizza.com/login which can be seen here on the wayback machine:
            <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131127172305/http://wethepizza.com/login">
             https://web.archive.org/web/20131127172305/http://wethepizza.com/login
            </a>
            However - it was last indexed in 2013 so it could be a false lead. Nonetheless the pages existence is a little suspicious, why would a Pizza joint have a login area? I know it's not the login for the backend as that is found here:
            <a href="http://wethepizza.com/admin/login">
             http://wethepizza.com/admin/login
            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            The Anons from the original post ended up not fulfilling what they said they'd do and they stopped posting altogether so I stopped investigating - that is until what I came across today which is their
            <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/v/pizzagate/1434525">
             latest update posted on 8chan
            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            Also, in the above thread I found a couple new leads into We The Pizza. The main piece of evidence is a leaked chat from We The Pizza on their Slack site. (Slack is a IM tool used by many countries so that employees can discuss things in realtime.)
           </p>
           <p>
            (

            Now read the below section which is copy and pasted from the chat itself:

           </p>
           <p>
            Doesn't it raise suspicions that they are using We The Pizza and that David Brock seems to love it? Just recently a
            <a href="http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2016/11/21/i-ve-been-making-viral-fake-news-for-the-last-six-months-it-s-way-too-easy-to-dupe-the-right-on-the-internet.html">
             writer from TheDailyBeast
            </a>
            took credit for fabricating that article and claim they also fabricated the chat. That's a weird coincidence right? This fits in with the whole 'fake news' coverup narrative the MSM have been running with since Pizzagate became more popular.
           </p>
           <p>
            I'm at work right now so can't dig any further but this might need more looking into.

            . Words used are very strange, video was deleted within an hour of it being found on youtube and had to be archived and reuploaded. She uploaded it a second time (as unlisted) and after a day or two switched it to private. Any remaining copies on youtube are reuploads and may or may not get taken down with DMCA notices.

           <p>
            On a whim, Eve, a young Swedish traveler, accepts an invitation from Peter to vacation on his family's private island off the coast of New England. As a series of unexpected delays prevent other guests from arriving, Eve discovers that she has little in common with the increasingly erratic Peter. Gradually the idyllic natural beauty of the island gives way and Eve finds herself trapped in a state of surreality punctuated by bizarre visions, dimensional shifting and secret pizza.

            Amanda Kleinman's band "Heavy Breathing" has a music video that references pedophilia. Most of the "Schtick" for her band is intentionally being provocative, weird, and awkward.

            “Get served at Comet Ping Pong, a hipster-heavy pizza parlor in the Upper Northwest with rough concrete walls, bathrooms hidden behind secret panels, and table tennis galore. Thin crust pies from the wood-burning oven are as much of an attraction as the regularly scheduled live bands.”

           </p>
           <p>
            That’s exactly what Kimball Stroud did after Sorvino attended a briefing on child trafficking on Capitol Hill with Sens. Ron Wyden (D-Ore.) and John Cornyn (R-Tex.), filmmaker Libby Spears (“Playground”) and several survivors of child trafficking."

             • In January 2015, the
             <strong>
              ASANTE Board
             </strong>
             was informed of allegations of serious misconduct against
             <strong>
              Mr. Amon Munyaneza
             </strong>
             , Asante’s founder and former executive director.
            </p>
            <p>
             The allegations were referred to an attorney and an independent professional investigator. The investigation included numerous interviews and an opportunity for Mr. Munyaneza to address the charges against him. The investigation also brought to light similar misconduct by Mr. Munyaneza, in 2009. At the conclusion of the investigation, the ASANTE Board had no choice but to terminate Mr. Munyaneza’s employment as executive director and called upon him to relinquish all engagement with the ministry worldwide. He has not done so. Mr. Munyaneza went back to Africa and became the leader of the Africa partners, as Board President of Africa Mission Alliance Rwanda.
            </p>
            <p>
             • For 18 months, the ASANTE Board has attempted to rebuild relationships with the Africa partners – Africa Mission Alliance Rwanda and Asante Ministries Uganda– to improve communications and program accountability. However, the board was met with little or no cooperation from the African partners, due to Mr. Munyaneza’s influence.

             <strong>
              Pizzapac
             </strong>
             is something of serious concern.
            </p>

             However,
             <strong>
              Pizza Packet
             </strong>
             is owned by "
             <strong>
              Itchie Gross
             </strong>
             "; His wife
             <strong>
              Jane Gross
             </strong>
             has comes up several times in the podesta e-mails. A few of her e-mails are referencing trips to Hawaii, based on wording at the same time as John Podesta, his brother Tony, or others linked with the DNC itself.

             The phone number if googled indicates that the business moved to a new location, and the owner of that business probably failed to remove the awning before relocating, so that lead is a dead end. The ownership of the 762 park place address is currently unknown and cannot be confirmed as legitimately associated with Pizza Packet.

             Google Maps indicates that it is the only house on the street with all windows barred; Does not look like a business of any sort. But some have noted that this isn't unusual for Miami. Lead is another dead end.

             Pizza Packet, though a legitimate company that does deliver an actual product, doesn't seem to have a legitimate business location that can be tied to it. It operates entirely out of two Post Office boxes in two different states. The owner of the company also is posing himself as a doctor in what used to be a medical supply business location, while not having any type of medical license.

              Viewing images of Alexandra Tydings in which you can see her right arm visibly, she has the same exact tattoo in the same exact spot:

              Child Protective Services Investigation Ends After Suspicious Death Of Lead Investigator

             <p>
              Former Georgia State Senator,
              <strong>
               Nancy Schaefer was an outspoken opponent of Child Protective Services (CPS)
              </strong>
              .
             </p>
             <p>
              Schaefer authored an investigation in which, among other findings, revealed the following: “…the separation of families is growing as a business because local governments have grown accustomed to having taxpayer dollars to balance their ever-expanding budgets.
             </p>
             <p>
              <strong>
               The Adoption and the Safe Families Act
              </strong>
              , set in motion by
              <strong>
               President Bill Clinton
              </strong>
              , offered cash “bonuses” to the states for every child they adopted out of foster care. In order to receive the “adoption incentive bonuses” local child protective services need more children. They must have merchandise (children) that sell and you must have plenty of them so the buyer can choose. Some counties are known to give a $4,000 bonus for each child adopted and an additional $2,000 for a “special needs” child. In this document, Schaefer makes it clear that organizations, such as
              <strong>
               The Second Mile
              </strong>
              , procure their underage victims by making children wards of the State. CPS has unchecked legal authority to remove children, with or without cause. Subsequently, CPS and their partners, the corrupt juvenile court judges can place these children wherever they see fit (e.g. The Franklin House, Boys Town, Elm House, The Second Mile Foundation) where unimaginable horrors take place.
             </p>
             <p>
              Schaefer and her husband died under very mysterious circumstances at their home in Georgia in March of 2010.

               I looked up the property owners on Pakala through the tax assessor's office (someone's paying tax on the property). From the old wifi post, both the property with the concrete pad (577 Pakala) and the wealthy property next door with the building that off-the-book power lines go into (563 Pakala) are both owned by the same organization -
               <strong>
                B P BISHOP TRUST ESTATE
               </strong>
               - the wealthiest charity in the state worth $10B and has a 10% stake in
               <strong>
                Goldman Sachs
               </strong>
               .
              </p>
              <p>
               In a 3 year period the estate lost an unaccounted for $241 million and operating costs increased by $19 million, maybe accounting for the underground construction. This was in the late 90s though, and the WiFi OP said he was doing construction there recently.

               ...quantity of available financial information about KS/BE (the trust) is amazingly limited. Even the court-appointed master compared his attempts to get information from these trustees to trying to get it from the CIA. The usually mild mannered master was "outraged" by the trustees' "specious rationale" for not properly disclosing vital information. He called their excuses "so pathetic as to border on the ludicrous."

               Really recommend reading the overview of BP Bishop Trust linked in that quote, it's plagued by scandal like everything else even tangentially associated with the Clintons.
