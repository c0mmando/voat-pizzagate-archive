<p>AFP - Agence France Presse</p>
<p>June 29, 2020</p>
<p>Germany is investigating some 30,000 suspects as part of a widening probe into a paedophile network in the western Bergisch Gladbach region, authorities said Monday.</p>
<p>The cyber crime unit in the state of North Rhine-Westphalia is &quot;investigating 30,000 unknown suspects&quot; in the case, the justice ministry for Germany\'s most populous state said in a tweet.</p>
<p>&quot;We want to drag perpetrators and supporters of child abuse out of the anonymity of the internet,&quot; the ministry said.</p>
<p>Those being investigated are suspected of sharing &quot;child and youth pornographic content&quot; including &quot;fictitious and/or real acts of abuse&quot; in anonymous online discussion forums and chat groups, the cyber crime unit ZAC NRW said in a statement.</p>
<p>&quot;I did not expect, not even remotely, the extent of child abuse on the internet,&quot; North Rhine-Westphalia\'s justice minister Peter Beisenbach told reporters.</p>
<p>What the investigation team had uncovered was &quot;deeply disturbing&quot;, he said.</p>
<p>&quot;We must recognise that child abuse on the internet is more widespread than we had previously thought.&quot;</p>
<p>The abuse investigations began last October with the arrest of a suspected perpetrator in Bergisch Gladbach, near Cologne.</p>
<p>To date, just over 70 suspects have been identified throughout Germany.</p>
<p>In May, the first offender -- a 27-year-old soldier -- was sentenced to 10 years in prison and placed in a psychiatric hospital for an indefinite period.</p>
<p>Germany has been left shocked at the discovery of several serious cases of child sex abuse over the past 18 months.</p>
<p>In early June, 11 people were arrested on suspicion of sexually abusing children and filming their actions after videos and photos were seized from the cellar of a 27-year-old man from the western city of Muenster, also in North Rhine-Westphalia state.</p>
<p>Investigators said they had identified at least three victims, aged five, 10 and 12 years old.</p>
<p>Officials said then that investigative capacities on child abuse had been increased, which would likely lead to the discovery of more cases.</p>
<p>In an earlier scandal in Luegde, 125 kilometres (80 miles) from Muenster, several men abused children several hundred times at a campsite over a period of several years.</p>

            If you that put headline into Google with Barron's before it you see you can still find that article.
           </p>
           <p>
            This is due to Barron's licensing agreement with the news outlet AFP.  It's not because of the subject matter.
