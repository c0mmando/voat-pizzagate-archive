            Will this be before or after HRC, the Podesta brothers, McCain, and the others are led away in handcuffs? Oh, wait. Do they still have those ankle boots on? They've been under arrest all this time, right? Did the sealed indictments open up yet? I'm losing track. But Q is on it. I have nothing to worry about. Patriots. This is not a game. I'll just keep waiting.

            There's no "insurance file." That was nonsense from an anonymous person on twitter.
           </p>
           <p>
            The NYPD hever had possesion of Weiner's laptop.  That whole story was a political hoax pushed for the election.
           </p>
           <p>
            it was a coordinated campaign to push disinfo and it worked. Erik Prince, Giuliani and others in the Trump campaign were behind it.
           </p>
           <p>
            If you believe in this story, please show how the NYPD got the laptop.  There was a federal subpoena for the laptop and it was seized by the FBI.

             YourNewsWire reported the 'passing off' of the laptop from NYPD to FBI.  YNW is (well) known for adding fictional elements to their reports.  Fair enough.
            </p>
            <p>
             Could passing off really just mean 'returning to'? Possession vs. Access
            </p>
            <p>
             If NYPD not in original possession of laptop, did NYPD have access to the computer?
            </p>
            <p>
             Otherwise what was NYPD doing during the joint investigation into Wiener's sexting and (report of) months of online relationship with a minor? Getting coffee for the FBI agents?

            <p>
             Using the term 'insurance file' was effective, it's what came to my mind.  Was there literally a tab marked 'life insurance' that was related to Clinton emails?  You say nay, I don't know, but in hindsight it wouldn't make sense to mark something that sensitive under 'life insurance' on a computer, if one really believes they are in danger.
            </p>
            <p>
             Could the contents of the additional Clinton emails on Weiner's laptop have been useful toward that end?  Or alternatively, would Weiner keep damning Clinton emails, not so much as 'life insurance' but as leverage in a custody dispute? (saw that theory too).

             Maybe we'll learn more.

              The DOJ inspector general is reportedly looking into why McCabe took three weeks to respond to a request to examine newly-uncovered emails that agents at the time believed could be relevant to the Clinton probe.

               The emails in question belonged to top Clinton aide Huma Abedin, who was married at the time to former New York Rep. Anthony Weiner. The FBI discovered Abedin's work emails on Weiner's laptop in late September 2016, while it was investigating him for exchanging sexually explicit messages with a teenage girl.

              I have not been able to find this out one way or the other. Again the story of the NYPD turning the laptop over and keeping a copy of the evidence is completely false as the FBI seized it originally.  Remeber the "sexting" occurred with a girl in another state, thus this is federal jurisdiction.   I think that there would be no reason for the FBI to turn over the laptop to the police.  Especially once Huma's emails were discovered, the NYPD would not be cleared for any potential classified info that might be there and that was what formed the basis of the search warrant for Huma's emails.

              What joint investigation?  You are assuming facts not in evidence here.  Where did you get the idea that there was a joint investigation?  The NY Times did a big, deep report on what led Comey to write his letter and there's no mention of a joint investigation.

              and?  What's the connection you are making?  There's no indication that Weiner or even Huma knew about this.  I believe the FBI believe the Huma connected her blackberry to the laptop and did not consciously move the emails there, but the phone backed itself up.

             <p>
              This is funny, because this is actually longstanding Department of Justice policy, not to do anything significant within 60 days of an election.  Comey violated this policy when he wrote his letter.  And he did have an effect on the election.
             </p>
             <p>
              The backstory to this is people believe the NY office of the FBI was leaking to the Trump camp.  Comey is said to have issued his letter because he feared word of the investigation would leak from the FBI officers in NY. Evidence for this theory is Giuliani went on TV talking about a big FBI surprise that was coming out and he talked about getting info from current and ex FBI agents.  He had to walk this back, because it would be illegal for FBI agents to be leaking this stuff.  And Giuliani was certainly part of this fake story being pushed by Erik Prince on Breitbart and YourNewsWire and TruePundit and Alex Jones.  Doug Hagmann went on Alex Jones with this "fake NYPD has evidence that will turn your stomach story" AND he admitted he was getting his evidence from Rudy Giuliani.
             </p>
             <p>
              Now at this point, you may want to ask yourself, why invent this fake NYPD story, when the FBI sources would have served the same purpose?   Because FBI agents were actually the ones pushing this fake story and didn't want their actions to be looked at so they pushed it off to the NYPD, even though the NYPD never had the laptop.

               Long story short regarding the answer to that.  I looked back to see where I had 'just read' about it earlier today.  Turns out that the term 'joint investigation' (as I used it) was a case of unintended conflation while searching and reading on the topic at hand.  I was reading a lot of info, also looking at various search pages.
              </p>
              <p>
               I think I construed the following Fox News timeline excerpt as a "joint announcement" (on the face of it, it reads that way), after reading something right after it. (both below)

              <blockquote>

                The Federal Bureau of Investigation and the New York Police department announced they were opening an investigation into Weiner after a 15-year-old girl told the Daily Mail the former politician sent her lewd messages starting in January 2016. The exchange continued for months.

              <p>
               So as it turns out, I didn't read FBI and NYPD 'joint investigation' in one article, but unintentionally conflated the two statements above while I was skimming through a lot of info.
              </p>
              <p>
               Don't have time to address your other questions right now, and I haven't had a chance to read the article regarding Comey, perhaps tomorrow I'll have a chance to read/respond.

                 I read through the article, here's the section you mentioned:
                </p>
                <blockquote>
                 <p>
                  The Daily Mail, a British tabloid, was first with the salacious story: Anthony D. Weiner, the former New York congressman, had exchanged sexually charged messages with a 15-year-old girl.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  The article, appearing in late September, raised the possibility that Mr. Weiner had violated child pornography laws. Within days, prosecutors in Manhattan sought a search warrant for Mr. Weiner’s computer.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  Even with his notoriety, this would have had little impact on national politics but for one coincidence. Mr. Weiner’s wife, Huma Abedin, was one of Mrs. Clinton’s closest confidantes, and had used an email account on her server.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  F.B.I. agents in New York seized Mr. Weiner’s laptop in early October. The investigation was just one of many in the New York office and was not treated with great urgency, officials said. Further slowing the investigation, the F.B.I. software used to catalog the computer files kept crashing.
                 </p>
                </blockquote>
                <p>
                 I had read one discussion that reasoned whether or not Weiner turned over the laptop, as opposed to what comes to mind when reading the term "seized". (sorry don't have it handy)
                </p>
                <p>
                 Couldn't have NYPD investigators or SVU have been given access if there was no urgency, and the FBI was hindered by their computer problems?  This case had been 'an unrelated case' to what came later. At some point the HRC linked emails were discovered.  Did NYPD Special Victims unit looking through picture files or video files on the computer?

                  Eventually, investigators realized that they had hundreds of thousands of emails, many of which belonged to Ms. Abedin and had been backed up to her husband’s computer.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  Neither Mr. Comey nor Ms. Lynch was concerned. Agents had discovered devices before in the Clinton investigation (old cellphones, for example) that turned up no new evidence.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  Then, agents in New York who were searching
                  <em>
                   image files
                  </em>
                  on Mr. Weiner’s computer discovered a State Department document containing the initials H.R.C. — Hillary Rodham Clinton. They found messages linked to Mrs. Clinton’s home server.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  And they made another surprising discovery: evidence that some of the emails had moved through Mrs. Clinton’s old BlackBerry server, the one she used before moving to her home server. If Mrs. Clinton had intended to conceal something, agents had always believed, the evidence might be in those emails. But reading them would require another search warrant, essentially reopening the Clinton investigation.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  The election was two weeks away.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  Comey learned of the Clinton emails on the evening of Oct. 26 and gathered his team the next morning to discuss the development.

                  Prosecutors in US Attorney Preet Bharara’s office have issued a subpoena for Anthony Weiner’s cell phone and other records, law enforcement sources said.

                 <p>
                  NYPD detectives and the Manhattan DA’s office are also “looking into” allegations that Anthony Weiner engaged in a months-long sexting relationship with an underage girl, sources told The Post Thursday.

                  The NYPD’s Special Victims Unit is investigating the matter after a 15-year-old high-school student released a trove of sick texts and photos she allegedly received from the disgraced politician.

Doug Hagmann went on Alex Jones with this "fake NYPD has evidence that will turn your stomach story"

                 This thought came to mind... the NXIVM related 'fright studies', THOSE videos.  Any one in a million chance that members or supporters of NXIVM are floating around the background in this NYPD/FBI/Weiner laptop 'video 'story? Just a thought. (in what motive or capacity I've not thought that far)

                  This is in the realm of hypothetical.  There's no indication the NYPD was involved with the laptop.  Your hypothetical is, of course, possible, but it leads to FBI and NYPD cooperating which is the complete opposite of what all these stories said.

             "That whole story was a political hoax pushed for the election." That story was made to Legitimize the ilegtimate FBI, as if they act on evidence of one of their own. Their job is to protect the system, to protect those compromised and doing dirty work from being exposed. Constantly it was pushed in here that something was going to happen any day now. I knew that was impossible because Weiner and Huma are working for the cabal, as are most politicians. They are allowed to be embarressed, thats it.
