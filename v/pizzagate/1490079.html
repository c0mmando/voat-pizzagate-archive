            I don't pretend to grasp how much you have suffered.... you would probably admit this is a spiritual battle as well and not just a bunch of pervs who like hurting kids... it is logical to fight back on a spiritual level along with the physical work that is being done to try and put these monsters away.... I hope you will help it the fight to save others.... it cannot possibly hurt to send positive energy to these children and I believe it does have a big affect.... peace and healing to you... I hope no one else suffers the way you have....sending  the love shield directly to you....

              Many would disagree as there is a non physical part to all of this... they follow the dark occult for a reason... they are doing things in the spiritual realm that gives them power and energy workers can try to counteract that on the same level... I know there are a lot of humans in pain and you are right,  this may not help them heal but it will help decrease the power of the scumbag satan worshippers.

            I'm a CSA survivor. You probably mean well and have a good heart. But it is extremely insulting to actual victims to have it implied that we can be healed, let alone by light energy. Do you know why child sexual abuse is so fking horrible? It's because you never heal from it. There is this sort of unspoken notion in psychology that if someone just has the right therapist and tries really hard in therapy, then surely they can completely heal. And so you wind up in a situation in therapy where you either pretend like you've healed in order to validate the ego of the therapist, or you let it be known that you're not healing because you can't, and then the therapist in one way or another blames it on you.
           </p>
           <p>
            Like one way to think of it, is that if a child falls down the stairs and gets bruises, they are going to be okay, because their bruises will heal. But if a child is thrown down the stairs because their parent hates them, the bruises will heal, but the child never will. That's what makes it so horrific and so depraved. You never fully heal, but you are expected to, by everyone. And the way other people, even therapists, define your healing is when you are no longer bothersome to anyone else, then you are considered healed.

             exactly. This is why abused dogs are put down- humanity does not deal with the pain and suffering it causes. People consider it an inconvenience, and defect in the dog, not the plain as day cause and effect of trauma. If you weren't traumatized as you are that would indicate a real defect. PTSD, trauma, the never healing is what make you human. When people get defensive and ask how they can help it is soo simple. Just be wtih me, in this reality, where people hurt you and you never heal and the suffering is unending and the best thing you can do is accept it to deal with it. Just sit with that for one minute with me. That would be a real help.
