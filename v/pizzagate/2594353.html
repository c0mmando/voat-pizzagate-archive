<p>&quot;The International Tribunal for Natural Justice launched the Judicial Commission of Inquiry into Human Trafficking and Child Sex Abuse at an inaugural seating in Westminster, London on April 16-18th 2018. The filmed testimonies are now available via this Official Commission site to the Press, Public and all interested institutions and organs of government. The principal intention behind this Commission is not to instigate witch-hunts or target individuals, but to set in motion a culture that ensures restoration of truth, disclosure and reconciliation around the subject of human trafficking and child sex abuse. Our goal is to achieve in 9 – 12 months what governments and leaders of the world have failed to do for centuries – shed the full light of truth on the nature and extent of the human trafficking and child sex abuse pandemic. Seatings will be taking place in Washington, the Hague and Rome in the months ahead. An Official Commission Report will be published and issued to the world-at-large at the Declaration event in Rome at the close of the Inquiry.&quot;</p>
<p>Take a look at just one of the filmed testimonies from experts in this field, people such as Belgian criminologist Carine Hutsebaut:</p>
<p>For 35 years she\'s counselled child killers, no longer believes that governments are protecting the children, thinks the governments are complicit, speaks of parents and organizations that deliver their children to &quot;networks&quot; that are protected by governments. In the course of her work has received many death threats:she states that she must be missing a gene as she doesn\'t know fear.</p>
<p>&quot;I don\'t know what to do with this information, I\'m against a ceiling and I can\'t breathe&quot;. By giving testimony and world wide publicity to her experiences, she hopes to break through that ceiling and help treat the pandemic child sex abuse rampant in our world that no longer has societal checks in place to protect children.</p>
<p>Ms. Hutsebaut describes pedosex offenders as people who enjoy hurting and destroying, much like borderline cutters they injure not themselves but others to feel alive. She mentions Royal families , describes them as inbred , power hungry, filled with anger and a sense of God like superiority.</p>
<p>She often gives therapy to victims who are badly injured by their captors but can\'t report to a hospital for fear of being killed. At point 24:14 she describes one of her patients who complained of losing too much blood. The patient stated that her captors butchered one of her nine rape conceived babies and sewed a piece into her vagina which triggered continual bleeding. (Photos included, not for the squeamish).</p>
<p>Ms. Hutsebaut gives stats on the estimated number of pedo sex offenders : 8 million in Old Europe and each one produces approx. 2000 more victims/offenders. .According to her, in the last 10 years in Belgium (with a population of 10million) 50 thousand young women have gone missing and she attributes this to networks that kidnap, torture and kill victims.</p>
<p>This criminologist makes the startling admission that in 35 years of treatment she has never had a patient with relapse (one hr/week therapy) yet the prevailing &quot;victim&quot; psychology approach to offender treatment has 98% recidivism (relapse). Her definition of  &quot;victim&quot; psychology theory :offender excuses himself as a victim because the injured party didn\'t say no, came to him willingly, made him do it,was there on that dark street corner alone provoking him,etc.  The only explanation she offers after 35 years in the field as to why one failing treatment approach is favored over another: obstruction in high places.</p>

            I adore you.  Would you please ad a NSFW to the post since SRA Victims/Survivors may be triggered by some of the info contained in the post and the video?  I know from reading and also working with a Survivor that this sometimes can happen to those that have experienced these Horrid Crimes.  An UPVoat4U for bringing this to our attention.

            I am a follower and supporter of the Tribunal in Brussels.  and their leader and  Byington.  They have had to deal with many attacks in order to shut them down.

             OK. First time I heard of this tribunal. The Belgian criminologist presented herself with much needed professionalism and expertise. She says the damaged people can be repaired. We need amplification on this.

              This Tribunal will in the future become known as the Public Record, the Peoples Court.  It's been grinding out evidence based decisions against the elites, for many difficult years.

              I think it is ITTCS.  Brussels and they have convicted Royals and Popes.  Nothing is done because these people all live on grounds that have their own Police and cannot be touched.  But the Awareness is Tantamount to finally getting them Locked Up.

               Yes, there is a London in the city of London, Just like the Vatican is in Rome but not part of it. Rotshchild's live there, and they are who your taxes go to. IRS is a collection agency of the FED, FED owned by collection of banks, owned by collection of Families. Vindicator and MF deleated a documentary I posted where the British Crown and Pope were convicted for their crimes against native children in Canada, mass murder. But you can't make the arrest, they are protected

                Yep.  They are protected alright.  I totally believe our money flies out of the country on Gossamer Wings.  That 's why they are always telling us we should not help the poor.  Our own people even.  Our next door neighbors could starve but we think our taxes should stay in the Govt.'s Coffers.  There Are NO Coffers.  It is All a Big PONZI Scheme.  The ITTCS is being attacked as a bogus org. when it is not.  They have convicted the queen and other royals and ratzinger . and jorge bergoglio.  It is beyond me that we allow all the posts regarding the pope and prince charles and royals but when we post about someone that has proven they committed crimes then we cannot post it. They are stealing our children and our money.  And It Is Beyond Shameful.
