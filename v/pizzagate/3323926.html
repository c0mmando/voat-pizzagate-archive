<p>Representative <strong>Stacey Plaskett</strong> was given thousands by Epstein, who is a convicted sex offender, and now faces sex abuse charges agiain. </p>
<p>The representative from the Virgin Islands, a territory of the United States, received donations of $2,700 three times since 2016 - <strong>a total of $8,100</strong>, according to CNBC, including her reelection last year.</p>
<p>Jeffrey Epstein <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeffrey_Epstein">owns</a> the Little St. James island, which is part of the Virgin Islands.</p>
<p>The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee also saw a check from Epstein offering $10,000 in October but <a href="https://archive.fo/MjkDa">returned it</a>.</p>
<p>A spokesman for Plaskett\'s office <a href="http://archive.fo/vvUz0">said</a> that she had no plans to refund the donations for now, according to the site. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>\'I’m pretty sure she’s not,\' they were told, before it was later confirmed that she was unlikely to return them. No further comments about case or donations were made. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Plaskett finished her 2018 campaign run with $359,000.</p>
<p>She has limited voting power in the House of Representatives due to being from a U.S. territory.</p>
<p>Plaskett is involved with committees and has responsibilities in the House, but she cannot cast a vote if it will be decisive.  
</p>
<p>Epstein has contributed more than $145,000 to democrats running for public office according to CNBC. He also donated $25,000 to the Clinton Foundation. </p>
<p>Other beneficiaries include Harvard University, which has yet to state whether they will return the donations, according to the Chronicle of Higher Education.</p>
<p>Epstein gave them money as part of his $30 million pledge for an evolutionary dynamics program.</p>
<h1 id="md-section"></h1>
<p>During her time at Justice Plaskett\'s boss, Larry Thompson, resigned and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stacey_Plaskett">was replaced by James Comey</a></p>
<p><strong>Comey asked Plaskett to remain on staff, and she served under his leadership as well.</strong> </p>
<p>Plaskett left government to be a deputy general counsel at <strong>United Health Group</strong>, where she worked in the Medicaid/Medicare division: Americhoice under the leadership of Anthony Welters. </p>
<p>She then relocated full-time to her ancestral home of the US Virgin Islands and worked in the private sector and then with the Virgin Islands Economic Development Authority. There she worked on tax incentive programs and public private partnerships.</p>
