<p>Dating at least as far back as when Pam Anderson first visited Assange I\'ve been reading a lot of theories about Julian Assange and Wikileaks. The theories can be broken into 2 groups to make matters simple.</p>
<p>In one group the theories all involve the death or removal of Julian Assange in October 2016. Some theories suggest that he was simply killed and all future communications from him and by extension Wikileaks are from other parties. The few appearances of Julian after his supposed death are digital fakes or were filmed before his death.</p>
<p>In this group also falls the theory that Assange was either killed or removed and replaced by a body double or clone. I don\'t wish to denigrate the work done by many into the possibility of body doubles or clones. But even they can understand that their evidence is limited and their theories very speculative. So I prefer to judge the viability of these theories based on the total weight of evidence and not whether human cloning is possible or not.</p>
<p>The remaining group is comprised of theories that Julian Assange and Wikileaks are compromised or have been agents of some government since the beginning. In other words, this group of theories generally portrays Assange as deceptive and acting against the interests of the people he claims to be serving.</p>
<p>There are some outliers and variations, but that generally summarizes the dominant theories. So, which group do you subscribe to? Or, do you have different thoughts on the matter?</p>
<p>To be honest, ever since I leaned about Wikileaks, being the realist that I am, I wondered, &quot;What better way for the establishment to cast a dragnet for unsavory information than Wikileaks?&quot; I still hold onto suspicions that Wikileaks was possibly set up to lure whistleblowers and that the most damaging material submitted to them is buried, the whistleblower silenced. I\'ve also wondered why more people haven\'t had similar suspicions.</p>
<p>But then I consider the bigger picture and the lesser known story of Assange and Wikileaks and I\'m less suspicious. I think if others did the same they would likewise be less likely to subscribe to the aforementioned theories.</p>
<p>Do you know anything about the US government\'s shenanigans arising from their apparent war with Assange and Wikileaks? Do you know anything about the inner workings of Wikileaks? Do you know anything about the nefarious acts of parties connected to Assange or Wikileaks? Take a look for yourself and see if your gut reaction is that it\'s all street theater, the only purpose of which is to further substantiate that Assange and Wikileaks are authentic.</p>
<p>By far the most comprehensive analysis of Assange and Wikileaks can be found at Jimmy\'s Llama...
<a href="https://jimmysllama.com">https://jimmysllama.com</a></p>
<p>If Wikileaks was a fraud and Assange an agent of the state, why would someone organize a coordinated media campaign to smear Assange and disrupt the relationship between Ecuador and the UK pertaining to Assange\'s asylum? What if the journalists involved were connected to George Soros and USAID?</p>
<p>Why would the foreign media make absurd claims about the costs to house Assange at the Ecuadorian embassy or make up claims of security reports detailing every move made by Wikileaks that portray them as devious and acting like an intelligence agency? A media campaign of this type took place just months ago. But it wasn\'t covered much by US media. Is Wikileaks a dragnet operation that intends to lure foreign whistleblowers?</p>
<p>The US and UK press do cover Assange, and the coverage is distinctly negative. They often cite sources that have been revealed previously as dubious NGOs or otherwise disreputable. That would make sense were Wikileaks a real thorn in the establishment\'s side, but not were it their own operation.</p>
<p>Why would US government agencies work so hard to conceal that there is a sealed indictment prepared for Assange? That would indicate the indictment contains some funky elements. Not to mention certain US agents and politicians making very telling statements about Assange. It looks to me like just what you\'d expect from a disgusting, bumbling, arrogant state apparatus seeking to destroy a legitimate threat to their rule.</p>',

            Multiple ops running concurrently with theatre directors on the ground reporting directly to the president. This includes foreign intel working with the president, and against. There are highly legitimate issues taking place, while completely fabricated situations and events. All intel is cointel. Everyone is on their own until full situational awareness can be achieved by unit leaders from within each theatre.

            I'm still on the fence but a few questions or things I find odd:
           </p>
           <ul>
            <li>
             JA was a hacker in the 90's, was very involved in security and cryptography, he used and even advocated encryption keys, yet refuses to sign w/ his PGP key..
             <ul>
              <li>
               doing so wouldn't 100% prove he is JA but it would certainly help, more importantly by not signing he leaves open the real possibility that he doesn't have access to his private key, why?
              </li>
             </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
             JA "hacked into the Pentagon and other U.S. Department of Defense facilities, MILNET, the U.S. Navy, NASA, and Australia's Overseas Telecommunications Commission; Citibank, Lockheed Martin, Motorola, Panasonic, and Xerox", and others; and in December 1996, "he pleaded guilty to twenty-five charges (the other six were dropped), was ordered to pay reparations of A$2,100 and released on a good behaviour bond,[44][47] avoiding a heavier penalty resulting from the perceived absence of malicious or mercenary intent"
             <ul>
              <li>
               so he hacked into US MIL systems and others, was charged and pleaded guilty in 96 and essentially just let off the hook because he meant no harm, I myself find this VERY odd. He must have known someone or something important.
              </li>
             </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
             Lady Gaga interviewed him on video, odd
            </li>
            <li>
             CEO of Google met with him in person, odd
            </li>
            <li>
             Close with Pamela Anderson, I think that's odd but  may be nothing to it
            </li>
           </ul>
           <p>
            I'm not saying I think he's dead or mia or otherwise compromised, but at the same time I don't believe he's offered compelling proof that he's not, and it's not that he's obligated to do that but that given his background I would assume he would want to. A security guy doesn't just dismiss security by saying well it wouldn't really prove anything..

            I don’t think wl is a fraud precisely bc it HAS been compromised since the podesta email drop. Many emails that were once there are no longer there, however you can see that they once were bc a search (eg. For Chelsea) will show a total number of results (eg: 300) but not all of those messages will actually appear to click on (eg. only 250). Not sure if they became evidence or what, but not everything is there anymore...

            Those last bit of why questions depends on the level of deception and public spectacle needed for said deception. He is a (perceived) chaos producer which is always an in-demand trade. But I'm biased because of his (perceived) stance on 911 and  it's hard for me to look past his child of the cia corn background tho.

            Okay, this is sad and what Voat has become. A haven for disinfo working overtime for the cabal and shills like Sawyer and the entylawyer. The entylawyer was a shock to me, but that's what a good disinfo specialist does. They post some truth so you start following, but then come the big fat lies. As for Voat, all the informed minds have been driven away. There are only a few hardcore geniuses/investigators onboard. Swordfish, MolochHunter, etc. You know who you are.
           </p>
           <p>
            Assange is fine. For obvious reasons, he can't make that known. And WikiLeaks is totally compromised for now. And it will remain playing dead until the right time. The cabal is the bear right now, mauling and kicking the carcass to see if there are any signs of life. There will be none given even though it will spring up and bite the pedo elite right in their asses.

            This seemingly pro-WL post itself is odd since you didn't mention the current theory that JA was extracted but WL was taken over. The theory that they now have nothing to do with each other.  You are attempting to control the narrative without mentioning the truth.

            Assange is ded, I know it, you know it, anyone who followed the whole October fiasco and the weirdnes on WL website knows it. I want to believe it is not so, so much that I truly did believe there is a possibility he was extracted but not anymore. Rest in peace, Assange.

            Still no PoL. WL shaming people into stopping asking for PoL. Weird RT interview, weird second inteview, deleted photos from JA's twatt, police took long time to answer a burglar report even though the station is close and embassy constantly monitored. 1984 references on WL files, JA's btc wallet censored , talks about deadman switch censored, alleged WLanon says he is on the run tryin to activate the backup dms...

            takeover, users questioning JA's safety banned, websites monitoring the "conspiracy" ddos'ed and archives deleted, WL makes a "best PoL?" pool and live video wins, WL ignores, people angry, WL responds "sthap askin for PoL, you are scaring JA's mother!".

           <p>
            that tells you a LOT. As does the assassination of the co-founder of Wikileaks a while back - cant recall his name right now
           </p>
           <p>
            also - it may well be that Assange was talking to govt insiders for a lng time. But does that mean they wer deep staters - or swamp drainers positioning the counter-attack ?

             Also Assanges Lawyer 'jumped' in front of a train!!!!!!  Sooooo many people dying for exposing these sick twisted criminals - I hope the ELECTRIC CHAIR is still in law there in the USA! OMGoodness, just realised that this train station is just 9 minutes from the school where the 2 children Alisa and Gabriel, SRAbuse Hampstead Cover-Up case took place.  That whole area is probably under control of the SICKOS! (the children testified that there were 20 'special children' all in their school and that the teachers and parents at the school were involved in the abuse + many of the surrounding homes/shops/swimming pool etc)  This raises more eyebrows?

            The Ecuadorian embassy was raided right after Podesta emails were leaked in October 2016.

           </p>
           <p>
            Assange went dark for a long period after this, no sign of him at his window, also a couple of sketchy / glitchy interviews with him were released which raised eyebrows. Many speculated these were computer generated / green screen.
           </p>
           <p>
            His dubious twitter account becomes very active after this too.. 
I think you need to be careful with the information being put as we don't know if he was taken during this raid and is currently being held somewhere.

            Wikileaks has been compromised since its inception - Assange is a programmed cult member ' The Family ' and wikileaks has been backed personally and professionally by many open societies members and associates, it received full MSM coverage on launch, Assange on the cover of forbes for example. Knowing what we know now is it not somewhat safe to say you don't make it to the cover of Forbes without some solid but dubious connections. Now don't get me wrong the data they put out is accurate, no question its the motives and intentions that are in question. inb4 dnc leaks / podesta leaks ..... Hillary was trash and was going to have a presidency marred with unrest and scandals, she was damaged goods and they needed to get rid of her ... I dont think they quite factored in the Trump pushback but that also remains to be seen. Wikileaks have never published a leak that credibly damaged Isreal's interests in any way shape or form. They are also still holding out on the Podesta emails they only ever released the inbox, but due to the way gmail is configured and the 'hack' was done we should also have John's sent items ... these were never published along with about 20 other known leaks they admitted they held but never leaked. I want to know who they work for and I think we may find it to be some like George Soros or his masters.

              Yeah a client synced with gmail like that should have given the works; sent items trash, drafts etc. Wikileaks have gone on record discussing nearly 11 other leaks that never materialised, there's a certain irony having an organisation founded on bringing transparency and accountability ... that's never released a single financial statement or declaration.
             </p>

              I hate to say this but Wikileaks does work for someone and it's not us.

               Well, there are so many things that don't add up... I think that JA is still alive, still in the embassy, but - and usually I'm cautious assuming this - has been MK Ultra programmed. That's actually the only explanation for why someone would stay in a 'prison' situation like this, although he might be connected to the people who are responsible for creating it.

                My major concern here with the whole embassy story is that the US and Ecuador have had extremely good relations for over half century, that coupled with Ecuador's not so great track record of press freedom, excerpt from Wikipedia
