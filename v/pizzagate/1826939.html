            Never heard of BAMN, glad I know now. I never heard of ANTIFA either till this year. Why are all these groups popping up everywhere? All I can say is psyop and a distraction. Divide and conquer, the people fight against each other and the elites stay at the top laughing. Wake up people.

            And yet Jevon was still brainwashed when he wrote that:
"I am running with Students for a Democratic University (SDU) as Student Advocate and I am an ex-member of BAMN. I think I can give a little bit of an insider's perspective as to why it is not a good idea to have dealings with that organization. The dislike that most people in the activist community on campus have of BAMN stems from the fact that they are very sectarian, undemocratic, and obnoxious. If the problems with BAMN stopped there, I would be for working with them. However, internally, that organization is a lot more corrupt than people realize."
           </p>
           <p>
            Jevon, an SDU student advocate (at the time of his writing), didn't take issue with the 'very sectarian, undemocratic, obnoxious nature of BAMN' at all, (and living with Felarca he/she must have been aware of their violent tactics as well).

            Wow! Thanks for bringing this to everyone's attention. The only person I could find on FamilyTreeNow(dot)com that the writer mentioned is Mark Airgood. That is his real name and does live in Oakland. I didn't try to verify if he still teaches. Maybe someone could see if they could get an interview with him. Inquiring minds would like to know why he's supplying cell phones to minors who have been coaxed into becoming runaways, and what role exactly he plays with BAMN.

              Thanks for the link. I'm starting to think that if we begin shining the light on these "elite" institutions that go by the illusion of being Ivy League (Harvard, Yale, etc.) and harbor most of the corrupt fraternities (ie. Skull &amp; Bones), we can damage their image enough that they'll feel it in their wallet. It will take time, but pretty soon, as word gets out, people will stop applying to these liberal brainwashing factories because they don't want to be associated with them.

            "For the folks who don't know who BAMN is ? Why let this ex-member tell you who they are!
           </p>
           <p>
            Letter from UCB alumn Jevon
           </p>
           <p>
            I am running with Students for a Democratic University (SDU) as Student Advocate and I am an ex-member of BAMN. I think I can give a little bit of an insider's perspective as to why it is not a good idea to have dealings with that organization. The dislike that most people in the activist community on campus have of BAMN stems from the fact that they are very sectarian, undemocratic, and obnoxious. If the problems with BAMN stopped there, I would be for working with them. However, internally, that organization is a lot more corrupt than people realize.
           </p>
           <p>
            The organization is tightly controlled by two members, the President, Shanta , and another founding member named Leland. There is no democracy in the organization. Members are encouraged to follow whatever perspective and course of action that Shanta and Leland put forward. When disagreements arise between base members of the group and the leadership (i.e. Shanta and Leland), that is when things get scary. In order to coerce people into doing what they want them to do, at the leadership's command, this organization engages in a whole host of disgusting behavior like physically dragging people to meetings and political events, denouncing members who disagree as crazy/suicidal and encouraging them to take unprescribed medication, stealing money and i.d. cards to restrict the movement of dissident members, spreading lies about such members to turn others against them, etc. The list goes on and on. The way the organization makes this possible is often by convincing members to abandon their lives and come live in BAMN households. There, such members often become financially dependent on BAMN and many times, have no choice but to comply with orders so that they can eat and not end up homeless. Furthermore, many of theBAMN members are teenagers so this fact makes it even more possible for BAMN to prey on people that become financially dependent on them.
           </p>
           <p>
            This issue has been coming up a lot lately so I am going to write a much more coherent statement on it documenting my horrible experience with this organization but I will start to talk about that here. I was one of those teenagers. I joined BAMN when I was 14 and remained in the organized until I was nearly 18. When I was sixteen, BAMN convinced me that my family was abusive and crazy and that it was better that I move in with BAMN members. I did so against my family's will. When my family started to look for me, BAMN advised me that it was best that I move from my hometown (Detroit, MI) to live with BAMN members in another part of the country. They told me that I could legally solicit emancipation (without my parent's consent) upon turning 17 and since my birthday was soon, this meant that I would not be away from Detroit for longer than one month. However, they lied. They took me to Oakland, CA to live with Yvette Felarca and instructed me to change my name to "Chase Stern" and cut off all contact with family and friends and even other BAMN members in Detroit. I complied, thinking that that would only be for a short time.
           </p>
           <p>
            However, upon turning 17, BAMN's leadership in Detroit just did not answer my phone calls. When they finally answered, they told me I had to just wait a little longer and each time, I would ask when I got to go home, this is the answer they would give me. I ended up being in Oakland for a year. A few weeks before I turned 18, I decided that I wanted to end the ordeal so I contacted my family and reconciled with them. My mother bought me a plane ticket back to Detroit. When I informed BAMN, they tried to talk me out of leaving, but I was adamant on returning home for at least a little while and having a chance to reestablish relations with my family and friends. When they realized they could not talk me out of leaving, they got physical. Yvette Felarca came into my room one night and instructed me to read out loud a statement that Shanta Driver had written and convinced me to sign about how my family was abusive. Tired of debating my decision with them, I refused. That night, Yvette and other BAMN members took turns sleeping by my bed to "make sure he doesn't go anywhere." They confiscated my house keys to restrict my movement.
           </p>
           <p>
            The day before my flight back to Detroit, I was packing my clothes when BAMN members came in and told me that I could not pack my clothes in that luggage because that was luggage that they had provided me with. At this point, I still had illusions in BAMNso I called Shanta Driver, thinking that Yvette was just being unreasonable and overly pushy and that Shanta would work everything out. I told her what was happening and asked her to speak with Yvette and the other BAMN members and request that they let me leave. Much to my astonishment, Shanta refused. At that moment, I realized that I was in a cult and not only was Shanta well aware of what was taking place but that it was her plan all along. I called my mom at that point and in the midst of me talking to her, one of the BAMN members, Adi Hoag, a former Berkeley student, screamed "Grab his phone!" and 3 BAMN members grabbed me and tried to take my phone. Luckily, they were all pretty slightly built women so I managed to push them off of me and make it outside the house. I ran to the neighbors, explained to them what was going on, and she let me inside and closed the door.
           </p>
           <p>
            My mom called the police and when they came, BAMN made up a lie about how I was trying to steal things from them. There were two white police officers and the 3 BAMN members there at the time were three white women so shockingly (or maybe not so shockingly), the police believed them and treated me like shit. All I was trying to do was get my belongings and get away and the cop said to me: "You, yourself, admit to be a runaway so why should we believe anything you say?" and "I should take you to juvenile and make you miss your flight tomorrow." I insisted on being able to get my belongings and at some point, the cops gave in and escorted me inside to get my things. Once inside, I discovered that BAMN had stolen the $70 I had in my room and all my id cards. I got what I could and left. The phone that I was using had been disconnected since it was the name of Mark Airgood, aBAMN member and teacher in Oakland. The neighbor, however, let me use her phone to phone a friend, whose parents let me stay at his house and dropped me off at the airport the next morning. When I tried to inform other BAMN members about what had happened to me, particularly other youth many of whom I had recruited and therefore felt responsible for putting at risk, I learned that BAMN had denounced me to everyone. They told people that I had went crazy and turned against the organization and went to the police and that everyone should call off all contact with me. They were also instructed to report my whereabouts to Shanta because they were looking for me to put me in a mental institution. Some BAMN members complied with this order but many did not, and ended up leaving the org in the fallout. I have heard many lies that BAMN spread about me to cover up what they did, including telling people that I tried to kill myself and that's why they intervened in the way that they did.
           </p>
           <p>
            When I got to Detroit and started to tell people about my experiences, I learned from some ex-BAMN members (who had remained silent) that I was not the only person that had an experience like that with BAMN. There were many others. Some of these stories are even documented on the Internet.
           </p>
           <p>
            Anyway, for the longest, I have been publicly silent about my experience with BAMN because like others, I have believed that since they play such an active role in politics, on and off campus, it's better to not bump heads with them. However, a few days ago, I received a phone call from a BAMN member that I had never met before. He had gotten my phone number from other ex-members of BAMN and he wanted to talk to me to help him through his hellacious experience with BAMN. At that moment, I realized that I could no longer remain silent. This organization is continuing to manipulate young people and it has to stop. This is a really dangerous thing because this organization is luring young activist-minded individuals and unlike me, most of the people who surviveBAMN draw the conclusion that they must abandon struggle. BAMN either converts you into a drone or it kills your fighting spirit.
           </p>
           <p>
            I feel so strongly as to not working with BAMN that I think it's worth sharing that deeply personal story with all of you. I feel like by working with them we are validating their disgusting tactics and empowering them to get away with things like this with more people. That's my piece.

            He sounds like what the Scientologists would call a "suppressive person." Once you're usless to them, you're shunned. The kid is lucky he had a family with means to get him back home.

            There's a long history of the intelligence community as well as NGOs (Rand Corp., etc...) using cults to do their dirty work.

            We already know that they have a mayor tied to them, but I'd bet a year's salary the people running BAMN have ties to either a government or quasi-governmental organization.  Gotta love the practical side of MK Ultra.

             This is one of the best comments I have read here in a long time.
Most people do not realize that behind cults, TV programming, "Satanism", etc. is really just intelligence services hiding in plain sight. It is all to the benefit of those who control intelligence (without borders).

              I respectfully disagree to an extent. Intelligence services, financial institutions, governments, schools, churches, and households are all sources of satanic activity when human beings fall prey to temptation, which we have since the Garden of Eden.
             </p>
             <p>
              Not saying that the respective organizations don't use it as a tool to control people, but anyone who thinks they can control demonic entities, who existed long before the world was brought into being, is a fool.

              To quote the great GK Chesterton when he was asked "What's wrong with the world?":  "I am."

               Chesterton was an agent. Aleister Crowley was MI6 agent number 666. Intelligence is hundreds, if not thousands of years old. John Dee, Queen Elizabeth I's "astrologer" was a kabbalist and intelligence agent who wrote in code for other agents. They invent religious/ cultic/ political movements in order to hide and manipulate without scrutiny.

                  Let's take for granted that you're correct and all 350lbs of Chesterton was working for MI; that doesn't negate his writings or his evangelism.  AA Milne wrote war time propaganda, but Winnie the Pooh is still a great children's book.  CS Lewis did his radio broadcasts which became Mere Christianity to counter the false religious teachings of the Nazis.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  Also, most people who work for intelligence agencies have no idea what other things the agencies are involved with. So people doing anti-Communist broadcasts for the CIA almost definitely didn't know about Operation Phoenix, for instance.

                   CS Lewis is one of the most obvious. Read Miles Mathis paper on him.
Christianity does not need these people to "evangelize". Whatever they write, the real purpose is propaganda.

            How do they get their money?  Did they possibly send out moldylocks to do "work" for them to raise money.  I assure you that or similar things are going on.  No people are sexless and when you have a coersive environment like that you know sex there is coersive and all pushed to further assist the leaders.
           </p>
           <p>
            This further supports my thesis.  Porn is human trafficking or at least some indistiguishable subset of it will be.  Human traffickers can use porn even without the studios knowing.

              BAMN is building the movement to end Jim Crow, second-class treatment of black people and other historically oppressed groups and immigrants, documented and undocumented. We are building a united mass, integrated Civil Rights Movement that will unite black and brown, LGBTQIA, and class struggle to win full freedom and equality for all. We are fighting to defend public education, to defend public jobs and public services, to win college financial aid and citizenship for undocumented immigrant students, and to make every school, college, city, municipality, and state a sanctuary for undocumented immigrants. BAMN is also fighting to build a new, international youth leadership for the environmental movement, highlighting the significance of intersectionality in order to foster mass, militant direct action to win justice for victims of police oppression and brutality.

             That's exactly what I realized reading this.  They use the same means to recruit and trap teens as sex traffickers.  No wonder they are so closely aligned to NAMBLA as explained in Honeybee's video.  They want parents out of the picture so they can take control of their children and use them for their purposes.

             I know this is a dumb ? but if they recruit teens, change names, how on earth would a runaway ever get a JOB much less school &amp; higher learning possibilities?  This CULT like network kinda encorps Rules 4 radicals with a whole lot of extra bells, whistles and other sick-o shit or am I missing more or less?

              They don't care about the kids once they have served their purpose in the cult. These are the disposable soldiers, like HItler's Brown Shirts, they do the dirty work and you throw them away. They don't care about their future because they never had one.
             </p>

              To get the lefty professors was probably just as easy. You have the old hippies from the 60's become professors, spread their views, they become tenured professors, they teach more professors, they push for college to be more accessible than in previous generations, lowered admission standards, usher in the youth masses and brainwash them.
             </p>
             <p>
              I'm sure if you go hunting you'll find a bunch of similarities to group that operated in the 1960/70's. Now those dirty fucking hippies have tons of money and are looking at the eternal dirt nap. So they want their vision of America/World to come true before they die, they have the power to make it happen or they thought they did. Trump being elected and push back from normies is probably not what they expected. Fucking, Soros lost about $1 billion when Clinton didn't win, I thought I read somewhere he has ties to Antifa too?

              about college professors arrested. It would be interesting to see what the BAMN presence is on/around those campuses where these people taught. I might have to look into that later.

              This is what Jevon says:
             </p>
             <blockquote>
              <p>
               The phone that I was using had been disconnected since it was the name of Mark Airgood, aBAMN member and teacher in Oakland.
              </p>
             </blockquote>
             <p>
              I can imagine them providing them with new names, addresses and credentials. That definitely wouldn't be a problem. What else can I assume from this confession? That these teens must make a % of the ones that go missing every year. And unfortunately, that the ones that don't comply or decide to escape like Jevon, well a % of them end up somewhere totally different, where they can never, ever be found...

               I think you are SPOT ON... as if our world has not got enough lunatic shit. The 60's was just a speck of what has now developed into a cancer, that truly needs a fix that is so tremendous that a new, worldwide vaccine "REALITY CURE"... My first grandchild was just born and all of this shit scares the hell out of me!!!

                Agreed. You know what's the best thing for us to do, though. It's to sit them down and have a long talk. Warn them, so at least they'll know what to expect and how to deal with it... I believe this should be our no.1 priority AND responsibility as parents and grandparents.
