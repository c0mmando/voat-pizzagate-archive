            I hate this because the Beatles are my favourite band and helped me through very bleak times in my life.   I don’t know why we have to focus on this really, Savile is dead and any crimes he committed have been pardoned.  I don’t understand why you’re posting this and for what reason you think it will help.  This sub has gone downhill so much and now you’re posting shit about a dead man who will never be punished.  Whatever.  Carry on.

             I understand your sentiments when one finds that beloved music and musicians are now subject to this type of scrutiny and in connection with such a sordid subject.  Believe it or not, I have to deal with that too. HOWEVER, if you are a regular to this forum you will understand how these links paint a picture of a culture that has largely been engineered by Tavistock and the intelligence services and always linking back to the British Establishment.

              I would like to ask you to please self-delete and repost with another title like 'Jimmy Savile worked with the Beatles'. Should only take 2 minutes, and there aren't so many comments so far.

              indeed wasn't their tour manager, but, as PC says in your quote, worked for them as a kind of MC.

                  And, of course, he knew Jimmy Savile well, as Savile used to compere The Beatles' Christmas shows, and, well before their worldwide fame, travelled with them.
“It's very difficult to talk about it,” McCartney says. “The thing is we knew Jimmy and we worked with him, he was a DJ, an MC on some of the shows. We were working in Yorkshire and we were still living in Liverpool. And we were coming back from a gig and he came in our van over the Pennines. We gave him a lift. He told us all these stories about his wartime exploits how he had been buying chewing gum and nylons and all that, and selling them. He had all sorts of stuff going on. He was the older hustler guy, and we were very amused by these stories because he was a great entertainer, but we dropped him off at his place outside his house and we said, 'can we come in for a coffee?' and he said, 'oh, no, not tonight lads'.
“When he'd gone we thought, 'why doesn't he let us in, what is it, because most people would have let us in that we gave a lift to?'. So we always thought there was something a little bit suspect.”

                  This 'all seeing eye' was created by trendy pop artist Peter Blake who co-created the Beatle's album cover Sgt. Pepper. Well, we all know about the occult references on that one and others. Even Aleister Crowley was included.

                 <p>
                  Peter Blake and Graham Ovenden worked together on a number of projects and were even together in a collective of artists known as the Brotherhood of Ruralists. Why would Tony Blair's new Supreme Court choose such an artist?

                  So, as The Who returned to celebrate their Live At Leeds concert, The Who and Peter Blake took the opportunity to work together again, this time with mutual ties to the University of Leeds. The new Live at Leeds 2 artwork was created by Peter Blake, following his personal discussions with
                  <strong>
                   Pete Townshend
                  </strong>
                  . The artwork joins the Peter Blake Music Art Gallery, as will Peter Blake’s Live 8 design. Live Aid and Live 8 are events in which Peter and The Who both played a central part. The Live at Leeds 2 artwork is the subject of a commemorative limited edition fine art print publication, signed and numbered by Peter Blake.

                  In 2003, Who guitarist Pete Townshend was arrested on suspicion of possession of child pornography. Police officers impounded seven computers from his £15 million ($25.5 million) home in Richmond, Surrey. Four months later Townshend received a warning as no evidence was found on his computers.

                  The Eel Pie Studios or Oceanic Studios at The Boathouse on the mainland nearby, formerly owned by Pete Townshend, were the location of several significant pop and rock recordings. Townshend's publishing company, Eel Pie Publishing, is also named after the ait.

                 This needs to be a re post.  I understand someone getting upset over their being mentioned in connection to Savile but it will be under Discuss, which means we need to air it out.  We have done this with many posts. I agree we need should and can post it under a different title.  IF something more incriminating comes about, then Katie Barr the Door.

                   I am not good at formatting like letsdo2.  It looks way more professional than what I could do.  I don't have the confidence, for I know my capabilities.  I am hoping someone picks it up.  It needs to be aired.

                   It’s simply an attempt to smear a person or persons name.  Post something with real evidence and NOT made up headlines and then I will gladly discuss.  Do you not see that by wildly accusing others AND misleading them that we are doing PG a disservice?  Get it right is ALL i am saying.  Thanks.

                    Well, you noticed some inconsistencies, I look into it, confirmed, and OP deleted immediately. And they didn't claim that the Beatles were pedos btw. So where's the smear attempt? They cited an interview with Paul McCartney with the Independent, and put the quote into the post.

                     Because any name mentioned on here will make people think that person is a pedo.   OP deliberately had it so that it seemed Savile and the Beatles were buddies and were rubbing shoulders on the daily.  No.  That is a smear attempt. Thank you for calling it out and getting it deleted though.

              I know all about the Beatles and the Tavistock / MI5 connections, about their satanism and love of Crowley, about Paul/Faul being replaced.  All of that has shocked me, yes, but I can stomach it because I find it interesting
             </p>
             <p>
              The rest of your post is good but the Savile parts seem like a smear attempt.  He was not their tour manager (you are being deliberately misleading!) and it’s not like they were close to him in any way whatsoever apart from once or twice in their EARLY CAREER when they were kids.
             </p>
             <p>
              My issue is that you are trying to get something started about the Beatles but there’s no evidence they were pedos and there’s no evidence whatsoever that they done anything with Savile apart from maybe he introduced their shows.
             </p>
             <p>
              But whatever.   Well done for being misleading and like I said, carry on.  Whatever makes you feel good.

               I did not write that they were pedos.  I wrote that Jimmy Savile worked with them.  And yes as a tour manager - not THE tour manager... what do you think tour managers do?
              </p>
              <blockquote>
               <p>
                “And, of course, he knew Jimmy Savile well, as Savile used to compere The Beatles‘ Christmas shows, and,
                <strong>
                 well before their worldwide fame, travelled with them.
                </strong>
                ”
               </p>
              </blockquote>
              <p>
               What do you think he was doing travelling with them? He worked with them.  Because of his reputation you need to understand that the newspaper articles try to create distance between them.  There are other articles which describe the working relationship between them in more detail.  Savile was a fixture on the music scene at the time. The Beatles were creating hysteria amongst teenagers at the time.  The perfect bait for pedos to hang around.
              </p>
              <p>
               I'm sure the Beatles had other tour managers during their career but 'head in the sand' syndrome isn't appreciated here.

And to be honest your title is misleading.  Girls travelled with the Beatles does that make them tour managers? Or groupies?

                When I’m home I’ll send you some proper research about the Beatles and their touring history.  In the meantime sure keep spreading lies.

            Anyone remember the Beatles album cover with the butchered babies on it? (Photo in article below.)
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             The album is remembered primarily for the controversy surrounding its original cover image.
            </p>
            <p>
             Taken by photographer Robert Whitaker, and said to be the Beatles' statement against the Vietnam War, this "butcher cover" image showed the band dressed in white smocks and covered with decapitated baby dolls and pieces of raw meat.
            </p>
            <p>
             In response to the negative reaction from radio stations and retail outlets, Capitol recalled all copies of the album and replaced the offending artwork.

             The Beatles are my husbands favourite group and I also think they have some great songs, but just because we like people and they make us feel good does not mean we gloss over any potential hidden behaviour. think- I was looking for that pic of the decapitated babies, but you got there first :)  ALSO the list of people on their Sargent Peppers Lonely Heart Club Band cover INCLUDES Alister Crowley - They chose who goes on their Album I would say?

             How is meeting them once working with them?  Bit of a joke and stretch to assume now the Beatles are pedophiles bc they bumped shoulders with Savile once.

               No, very closely are people like George Martin or Billy Preston who worked with the beatles, on their albums, in the studios, VERY CLOSELY.
              </p>
              <p>
               introducing the Beatles on stage in an early 60s disco hall in the middle of nowhere in England is not working closely with them
              </p>
              <p>
               Savile had his own perverted shit and none of it involved the Beatles.   This is the biggest band in the world I’m fairly sure the secrets would have come out about them had they been pedos.  Absolutely disgusting.

                Again- I'm not saying THEY were pedos... see my other comment. But I won't reply to any further comments from you.  Think the blood which has rushed to your brain needs to recede first and then you can re-read the post with more rationality.

              It was more than a one-off meeting. From first article linked above: "And, of course, he knew Jimmy Savile well, as Savile used to compere The Beatles' Christmas shows, and, well before their worldwide fame, travelled with them.
             </p>
             <p>
              “It's very difficult to talk about it,” McCartney says. “The thing is we knew Jimmy and we worked with him, he was a DJ, an MC on some of the shows."

               So NOT a tour manager and NOT someone within the Beatles inner circle.  This was clearly in the early 60s when they were just starting out.  The occultism in the Beatles Work didn’t start till after 1966 and there’s no evidence or mention of Savile then.

                Agreed, at least based on what McCartney was saying. Don't know where the tour manager thing came from.

            *We were working in Yorkshire and we were still living in Liverpool. And we were coming back from a gig and he came in our van over the Pennines. We gave him a lift.
           </p>
           <p>
            we dropped him off at his place outside his house and we said, 'can we come in for a coffee?' and he said, 'oh, no, not tonight lads'.

           <p>
            “When he'd gone we thought, 'why doesn't he let us in, what is it, because most people would have let us in that we gave a lift to?'. So we always thought there was something a little bit suspect.”*

            According to extracts from Myra Hindley’s diary quoted in Emlyn Williams’s Beyond Belief, she and Ian Brady were indeed regular punters at the New Elizabethan Ballroom at the now-demolished Belle Vue pleasure grounds, in Manchester’s Gorton district.
           </p>
           <p>
            She daydreamed about the two of them being billed as featured dancers there one day, and we know that they attended at least one of the many "Carnival Nights" hosted by the venue's resident DJ at the time, Jimmy Savile. Myra Hindley was a Gorton girl, living at her grandmother's house on Bannock Street. Savile’s big red fuck-off Rolls Royce was a local landmark, regularly parked on ostentatious display right outside the entrance.
           </p>
           <p>
            Savile sequenced two "smooch times" in his DJ sessions (still called "record dances" in those pre-disco days): one before and one after the live group that he reluctantly put on as a sap to the Musicians' Union. The second smooch time would segue into an hour of rock 'n' roll, followed by a Ray Conniff-driven proto-chillout to end the evening and clear the room with as few altercations as possible.
           </p>
           <p>
            On Boxing Day, 1964, Brady and Hindley made an audio recording as they bound, gagged and photographed Lesley Ann Downey before they killed her. The tape ends with a snippet of the song "The Little Drummer Boy". It was the version by Ray Conniff.

              are you tagging me for a joke or?  thanks but I'm really not interested in this because it seems to me that there is no proof whatsoever of Jimmy Savile being a tour manager for the Beatles apart from one article where Macca says that they were in the same show circuit.
             </p>
             <p>
              if anyone can show me cold hard proof that the beatles are pedos and child rapists then i'd love to see it but so far, it's just been absolute bs.
