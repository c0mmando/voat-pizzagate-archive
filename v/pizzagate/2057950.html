            Friends of the Orphans is a US based fundraising group.   How is that tied to Silsby's kidnapping?   None of the 33 arrested were taken from orphanages.  In fact, none were Orphans.  The AP tracked where all the kids came from.

             I've pointed this out to you before and you didn't respond. The theory here is that Silsby
             <em>
              got away
             </em>
             with 100 kids from Friend of the Orphans. She was
             <em>
              caught
             </em>
             with 33 kids she gathered up off the street, but her "lawyer" Jorge Puello claimed she got kids from an orphanage that crumbled in the earthquake and called for help. Perhaps the sex-trafficker posing as a lawyer for a child trafficker slipped up and wasn't supposed to divulge that info. Perhaps he pulled it completely from his ass, but, that would be a strange coincidence given that the director of that orphanage has ties to Alefantis and Brock.
             <br/>
             Friends of the Orphans indeed had a building that collapsed
             <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/v/pizzagate/1601423">
              (or was it demolished?)
             </a>
             , but they claimed no children were in it at the time. However they reported that 100 fewer children were in their care post-earthquake.
             <br/>
             I think that's enough strange coincidences to warrant a real investigation. Friends of the Orphans was never even questioned after Puello asserted that they were involved with Silsby.

NPH USA, founded in the United States in 1965, is a registered non-profit corporation dedicated to improving the lives of orphaned, abandoned and disadvantaged children through support of the Nuestros Pequeños Hermanos/Nos Petits Freres et Soeurs (NPH/NPFS, Spanish and French for “Our Little Brothers and Sisters”) network of orphanages in Latin America and the Caribbean. Founded by Father William B. Wasson in 1954, NPH has provided ongoing support to nearly 16,000 children. NPH currently cares for over 3,700 children in nine countries: Bolivia, the Dominican Republic, El Salvador, Guatemala, Haiti, Honduras, Mexico, Nicaragua and Peru. In 2010, NPH outreach programs assisted more than one million children and adults in Haiti alone. NPH USA helps provide NPH children with food, clothing, shelter, health care, an education, and opportunities to break the cycle of poverty.

               History[edit]
In 1954, a hungry, homeless boy was arrested for stealing from the poor box of a small church in Cuernavaca, Mexico. The church’s priest, Father William Wasson of Phoenix, Arizona, refused to press charges and asked for custody of the boy. Within a few days, eight more boys found a home with Father Wasson. He gave them a safe environment and a chance to turn their lives around. By year’s end, 32 boys were in his care and Nuestros Pequeños Hermanos was born.
Father Wasson’s devotion to the care of orphans inspired an outpouring of financial support and volunteer helpers for his humanitarian cause. NPH USA traces its roots to Father Wasson’s family and friends in Arizona, who sent clothes, food and money. In 1965, Friends of Our Little Brothers was incorporated in Arizona as a nonprofit organization. Affiliated but separate nonprofit support groups called NPH USA were created in Minnesota (1986), Washington (1988) and Illinois (1999). An organization in Virginia, called Our Little Brothers and Sisters (OLB&amp;S), helped start fundraising offices in Europe as well as Canada. On July 1, 2005, the offices in Arizona, Illinois, Minnesota, and Washington State became regional offices of the national organization – NPH USA. In addition, new regional offices were formed in Florida and Virginia. The new offices were made possible by the fundraising support of OLB&amp;S.
Philosophy[edit]
Children at NPH homes – called pequeños – are not available for adoption; instead they form a part of a larger, stable, permanent family environment at the homes, giving them a chance to focus on education and personal growth. They are taught the values of work, sharing and responsibility in a Christian environment. Each has the opportunity to finish a technical course or seek a university degree. All children are asked to give back a year or more of service to NPH. Through this act of gratitude, each graduate shares the responsibility of raising the family. Pequeños have the goal of becoming contributing, self-sufficient and caring citizens in their own countries.
Former pequeños are educators, doctors, accountants, carpenters, farmers, mechanics, artists, administrators and social workers. Some work for NPH, while others support NPH USA and NPH by sponsoring children, organizing fundraisers, or attending special events and serving as ambassadors for the organization.
All of the NPH homes strive to be self-sufficient and most operate their own schools, clinics, gardens and farms. For example, at NPH Honduras, all of the fixtures and furniture, as well as most of the clothes and shoes used by the children, are made by pequeños in vocational workshops, while NPH Mexico produces enough livestock, fish, fruits and vegetables to satisfy most of the children’s needs. What the homes are unable to provide internally is donated by supporters from around the world.

               </p>
               <p>
                As a result of the 7.0 earthquake on January 12, 2010, NPH USA and NPH/NPFS suffered the tragic loss of staff, volunteers and family members, and extensive damage to its facilities. Despite these losses, thousands of victims received aid immediately and continue to be helped through various programs, including:
St. Hélène Orphanage for Children, a permanent home to 400 children. Over 200 external students from the community attend the on-site school. Children displaced by the earthquake are being integrated into the home.
St. Don Bosco, which supports roughly 250 children and youths from St. Hélène who now live with extended family or in group homes and attend secondary school, including a vocational school. The future site of the Don Bosco school and student dorms is located in Tabarre, near the hospital.
St. Damien Hospital, serving as a hub for trauma care for earthquake-related injuries as well as maternity care. It also have become one of the premier orthopedic medical centers within Haiti. Teams of doctors, nurses, and other medical professionals from all over the world arrived to help care for the wounded. Within the first three weeks, the hospital attended to over 10,000 adults and children. Teams also distributed emergency aid of food and water to numerous tent cities.
St. Anne, a rented temporary home for up to 40 children age 6 and under. It was established in response to the thousands of children left homeless by the earthquake.
St. Louis, a temporary child protection camp for over 120 vulnerable and displaced children. The camp, located in Tabarre, is constructed out of shipping containers. Capacity of the camp will eventually be 350.
Father Wasson Angels of Light, an emergency response program for children living in tent cities. This day camp provides educational activities and meals for 2,500 children. Youths who grew up at NPH/NPFS help coordinate the various programs. The program plans to open a primary school for 700 students and offer about 60 jobs.
St. Germaine Rehabilitation Center, providing physical therapy, a special needs school and a meal program. A prosthetics lab and physical therapy program for amputees began shortly after the earthquake.
The St. Luke Foundation, developed to manage numerous outreach programs in the poorest areas surrounding Port-au-Prince. An affiliate of NPH/NPFS, the foundation's most recent project is an adult hospital that was opened right after the earthquake. Additional programs include schools, clinics, food and water distribution, and dignified burials.
St. Francisville, a facility that produces a variety of goods, including cement blocks, cobblestones, bread and pasta. There are also workshops for automotive mechanics, sewing, printing and digital production. The goods and services are used by NPFS and St. Luke as well as external organizations. Following the earthquake, bread production was accelerated to 5,000 rolls daily and the buildings were used as a warehouse distribution center.

               </p>
               <p>
                Secondly, this entry confirms what I said.  There is no orphanage in Haiti called OR run by Friends of the Orphans.

                , the answer to this question that you asked above is because this building was not an orphanage.  It was their adminstrative offices.  See locations below.
               </p>
               <blockquote>
                <p>
                 Friends of the Orphans indeed had a building that collapsed (or was it demolished?), but they claimed no children were in it at the time.
                </p>
               </blockquote>
               <p>
                Friends of the Orphans raised funds in the US.  They are a US based organization.  They raised funds for Nuestro Pequeno Hermanos, which runs orphanages and of course, Nuestro Pequeno Hermanos DOES NOT translate to Friends of the Orphans.  In Haiti, they were known in French as Nos Petits Frères et Sœurs which also does not translate to Friends of the Orphans.
               </p>
               <p>
                This distinction between a fundraising group and the actual folks who managed the orphanage is a rather large distinction that you are missing.   They are distinct and separate groups.
               </p>
               <p>
                Friends of the Orphans are now named NPH USA and their website reflects that.  However, when this first came up months ago and at the time of Haitian Earthquake, they were still using Friends of the Orphans.  For proof here is there IRS 990 from 2012
                <a href="https://www.nphusa.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/2012_Form-990.pdf">
                 https://www.nphusa.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/2012_Form-990.pdf
                </a>
               </p>
               <p>
                This is proof that "Friends of the Orphans" would not be the name used in Haiti like I said.  And the reason being is they are separate organizations.
               </p>
               <p>
                Just to Emphasize the fact that NPH USA is different from NPH, if you volunteer at NPH USA, you do not work with orphans or at the orphanages, because they are not part of NPH USA.  If you want to volunteer at a home, it's handled through NPH

                NPH did not run many orphanages in Haiti at the time of the earthquake.  They ran many in the Caribbean and in South America, but not "many" in Haiti.   After the Earthquake they opened many new facilities in Haiti which are in your listing.  To understand what they operated at the time of the Earthquake, you to know about that they had 3 main locations, Kenscoff, the orphanage, a hospital in Tabarre in Port Au Prince and their main offices were in Petitionville.  Within these three locations, they had multiple programs.

                  In 2010 Friends of the Orphans was not yet part of NPH and there is no orphanage in Haiti called Friends of the Orphans.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  If you were referring to NPH's orphanage in Haiti, you wouldn't even say NPH.  You would say the St. Helene Orphanage or  Nos Petits Frères et Sœurs.

                  I use three accounts, but I am not using them dishonestly as sock puppets.  I deliberately named them the same way
                  <em>
                   to make it transparent
                  </em>
                  it's the same person.  You are completely wrong about my honesty.
                 </p>

                  If you want to know why I have three accounts, retract your falsehood and I will tell you.

                     You refuse to answer upfront why you use 3+ accounts. The hallmark of a shill is to use multiple accounts to give themselves upvoats or to try to dampen the effects of downvoats.

                    <p>
                     "1) Silsby lied and said the kids were orphans when they weren't.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     2) Silsby was repeatedly told not to take the kids out of Haiti without government permission. She was told that by both the Dominican Republic and Haiti. She ignored both their warnings and she was arrested for child trafficking.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     3) A child's organs are worth over $1,000,000 and provide a compelling financial incentive for any child trafficker. At the time of her arrest Laura Silsby's business was struggling and finally went bankrupt.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     4) Children are also used in Brownstone Operations. Jeffrey Epstein and Mossad ran a Brownstone Operation on a Carribean island close by called Little St. James. Mossad used underage children to gather sexual blackmail evidence which is often used to control politicians. Dennis Hastert is a prime example of how TPTB put compromised politicians in positions of power so they can control them better."

                     All of this is relevant because organized crime is dependant on legitimate fronts and plausible denibility.

                     Care to explain why people about to publically report evidence of foul play on Hillary's part have an alarming tendency to end up dead by suicide? Such believable suicide methods like "beaten to death by a dumbell" or "two gunshots to the back of the head"? All of those sound like excellent ways to mete out her execution. Karma is an ironic bitch, made even greater when it gets arranged to happen by mortal hands. XD

              Already gave the "shill equals auto downvoat". Downvoating shills cripples their ability to comment, thus reducing their take home pay based on amount of shill posts they make.
