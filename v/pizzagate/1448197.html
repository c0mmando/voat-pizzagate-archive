            The lack of investigation by the police and the disclosure of some of the Court documents online has had a massive impact on the general public. We understand that more than 30 million people worldwide have viewed the various related material online and the numbers are growing. This has consequently led to a unique situation where concerned members of the public have been conducting their own investigations in order to, in their views, protect P and Q and ascertain whether the children allegations are truthful or not. The Appellant submits on their behalf that they are not “evil” nor “foolish” but just a concerned public who request that a full, prompt and effective investigation is carried out by the police.

            The online researchers allege, with some evidence, that an IP address linked to Mr Dearman has links to child pornography and prostitution. One of these links has advertisements for the sexual service of a 9 year old girl named with the same name as P (see comments on exhibit HR1 and video number 17 titled “Dearman Child Pornographer?” on the Hampstead research website). Although, the Appellant cannot verify the truth of these findings, it is submitted that this provides further reason for an official, transparent investigation to be launched as a matter of urgency and public interest. The public outcry demonstrated by the fact that they feel they need to do their own investigations highlights the serious concerns of the general public about the integrity of the officers involved in the police investigation and of the safety of the children which need to be addressed.

            The medical reports end any debate regarding the fact that children A and G were the victims of child sexual abuse in Hampstead and underline the criminal nature of the police interviews of September 17th, 2014. The question now is who is being protected? Who has the influence and power to cause the British police such an obvious and inexplicable mid investigation rethink? Clearly there is much more than a Z grade actor and the reputation of a school at stake here. Neither would logically merit the police choice to destroy this investigation and cover up these heinous crimes.

            Background Chronology
           </p>
           <p>
            September 5th 2014
“A referral was made to the Barnet CAIF by (the mother’s partner’s) brother in law who is a special constable. Following a disclosure by A and G that they had been sexually abused by their father and “teachers” and were part of a cult. This disclosure had been made when they were in Morocco over the summer. And the parents stated they were unsure who to inform as many people seemed to be involved, (including allegedly police and social workers.)
Initial police interviews conducted.

Initial strategy meeting held.

           </p>
           <p>
            September 11, 2014
Emergency Police Protection Order issued after the ABE yesterday evening during which witness A, witness G and witness E (mother) were interviewed separately.
Allegations of physical abuse from the mother’s partner towards both children and sexual abuse against both children by their father and “teachers”. They are now in Emergency Foster Placement.”
           </p>
           <p>
            September 17, 2014
Police conduct the retraction interviews in transparent attempt to bury the truth and vandalise justice.
Interviewing officers clearly bully false retractions from the children for unknown reasons that can only be sinister.
           </p>
           <p>
            September 22, 2014
Police inform the mother E that they have found that the crimes against the children cannot be confirmed. The investigation is over.
           </p>
           <p>
            September 22, 2014
Dr. Hodes writes the second medical report affirming the veracity of the sexual abuse allegations despite the retractions. Dr. Hodes cites a specific research finding that found that 16% of victims will retract the allegations and affirming therefore that the physical evidence of abuse should outweigh the retractions.

            These statements were made without reference to the disgraceful performance of the interviewing officer ["Steve"] in the retraction interviews, which only strengthen Dr. Hodes’ assertions.

            HAMPSTEAD COVER UP UNCOVERED
The shocking internet video revelations of child sodomy and murder committed by seemingly respectable members of the community within schools, churches and private homes in the affluent Hampstead area of London created an internet storm after going ‘viral’ on YouTube in February 2015. Millions of people on both sides of the Atlantic viewed the graphically compelling testimonies of the brother and sister Gabriel and Alisa.
           </p>
           <p>
            These two innocent child victims were abducted by agents of the State on 9-11-2014 to prevent them revealing more details of the secretive workings of state sponsored mind control programs.
           </p>
           <p>
            Alisa and Gabriel have been held incommunicado from their mother and Russian family since January 2015. The children’s extensive family is becoming increasingly concerned for their welfare as all attempts to arrange contact with the children are met with delays, lies, and obfuscation.
           </p>
           <p>
            Alisa and Gabriel’s testimonies have revealed a secret network of organisations including the Social Services (SS), CAFCASS (Children and Family Court Advisory and Support Service); the Metropolitan Police, the Judiciary, legal representatives, media (most notably the BBC), Barnet and Camden Local ‘authorities’ and an array of counter intelligence operatives connected to child trafficking, snuff movies, organ trafficking, Ritual Sexual Abuse (RSA), torture &amp; money laundering, operating in schools, nurseries, churches, hospitals, universities, and military bases throughout the U.K. and the rest of the world.

            <blockquote>
             <p>
              The officer who conducted all three "interviews" with both Gabriel and Alisa is a member of the baby-eating cult ... presumably he is from a different branch in London and was unknown to the children. 
I named Detective Constable Steve Martin as a cult member on my Facebook Page with 100,000 Likes, ten months ago ... DC Martin knows that and I have not heard from him, or from any of his many CANNIBAL COP friends. 
All three "interviews" with both children are a cover-up from the start ... that is why DC Martin is constantly distracting the children with trivia about bowls and tables, etc., in the first two "interviews". 
The third pair of "interviews" are all about getting the "retractions".
Alisa's "retraction" is clearly partly rehearsed and she starts it off by saying "So what are we going to start off by saying?". 
DC Martin is using the cult's secret sign language to coach Alisa throughout her "retraction".
But Gabriel's "retraction" is achieved more through direct coercion. 
Gabriel starts off by trying to tell the truth, many times ... he says that his father kills babies seven times (read the retraction analysis from HampsteadCoverUp.com and the one by
              <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/user/DrifLoud">
               @DrifLoud
              </a>
              ). 
But baby-eater DC Steve Martin keeps saying things like "You won't get in trouble if you tell the truth now" ... implying that Gabriel was not telling the truth earlier and that he will get in trouble for saying those things. 
I assume that at some point during this "interview", Gabriel decided that if he ever wants to see his mother again, he should just say whatever baby-eater DC Steve Martin wants him to say. 
Alisa figured that out sometime before her "retraction" ... of course, neither child has actually been allowed to return home to their mother, more than 26 months later. 
The children's "retractions" are also inconsistent with each other, and the children never "retract" about 90% of the very serious criminal accusations that they made in those first two "interviews" and in the original home videos.
There is lots of analysis of the children's police "interviews" in the photo albums on facebook / United Kingdom Prime Minister Theresa May Eat Babies  (blocked in the U.K.).﻿&gt;

             I wouldn't call this debunked at all. The boy was probably grilled for hours before he finally figured what he had to say to
