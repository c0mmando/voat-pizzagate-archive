<p>TOYFREAKS INVESTIGATION SCREENSHOT DUMP
<em>Spiderman Unmasked = DNC on Wikileaks, Code Word Annabelle = Girl Sex Slave, Code Word Shark = Child Predator</em></p>
<p>There is definitely something weird with the Marvel Characters and Elsagate. If you go to Wikileaks and search for Toy Freaks without quotation marks, you get a random selection of leaked emails with the Spiderman mask icon on the right side, and the mask being pulled off reveals the DNC logo. </p>
<p>I cannot do this justice at the moment due to the vast amount of schedule conflicts going on in my life right now. But because I haven’t had tons of time, and because ToyFreaks “dad” Greg Chism just started posting again 2 days ago, I’m going to just dump a large amount of the screenshots I’ve gathered along with my conclusions. I’ll go through these all in a more organized fashion in the near future.</p>
<p>Conclusions:</p>
<p>Amongst the pedos following ToyFreaks on YouTube and Twitter are numerous Satanists. Many were upset that he had not posted in a month – starting with comments begging for more videos after only a few days or two weeks. Some are now unsubscribing because the “live feed” from July 26 or so was faked, and because the newest video wasn’t a “freaky” enough looking video I guess?</p>
<p>“Annabelle” is seeming to be a code word for a pedophile’s dream sex slave – as evidenced by the screenshots below. Namely, the instagram of a girl whose description is simply “Annabelle” and the earlier video screenshot where Annabelle is in quotations after the code word clover for Child Lover.</p>
<p>The younger of the two ToyFreaks girls is in serious danger. As shown in the comment “No one mses (misses) Annabelle.”</p>
<p>Someone has alluded to their faux murder in one of the videos.</p>
<p>Pedos get mad when ToyFreaks dad does not post for two weeks and he is now saying he was in the hospital (for a month?).</p>
<p>The Twitter profile posted in October 2011 the same time that Lisa Irwin was kidnapped and the new one created in July 2017 have some creepy stuff going on. The new one only has one follower, who has since been blocked from being viewed by me. She posts about being a webcam porn star. I found numerous satanic and sex related followers amongst the people he follows or who follow him on instagram and Twitter. I also found a profile commenting on his instagram using the code word Annabelle and the profile avatar of the younger girl from the Family Fun Pack channel on YouTube, but that person is going by the name “emily.alm” and her description only says “Annabelle” and it’s a different girl in the pictures. I also found a hispanic baby being marketed with the weird child porn suspected codes on instagram and it is a ToyFreaks fan.</p>
<p>AnnabelleLeigh.net was a girl lover website that got taken down several years ago. If the FBI does nothing, it’s up to us to expose this.</p>

            The image showing Spiderman unmasked as the DNC is a logo adopted by Wikileaks to go with its Sony document leaks:
            <a href="http://www.scpr.org/programs/the-frame/2015/04/16/42429/wikileaks-releases-searchable-database-of-sony-lea/">
             http://www.scpr.org/programs/the-frame/2015/04/16/42429/wikileaks-releases-searchable-database-of-sony-lea/
            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            Some of the documents show instances of the words "toy" and "freak" separately in different contexts.  The Amazon documents are the only ones that mention ToyFreaks the company, and they are records of how much ToyFreaks and others were paid as Amazon Affiliates.  Some of the things people linked from ToyFreaks to Amazon to buy were Sony products.  Here is info explaining Amazon's Affiliate Program:
            <a href="https://affiliate-program.amazon">
             https://affiliate-program.amazon
            </a>
            dot   com/
           </p>
           <p>
            I agree that ToyFreaks is attracting obvious pedos, and you're doing a great job exposing that.

             Great Idea. I could not do that but someone should. This stuff should be hacked by a pedo fighter.  These sickos may carry out a very serious act if they have not already.

            not new to pg, but am new posting.
           </p>
           <p>
            i was searching the donna blu airport hanger from old cia/cocain days, and there is a highschool on the same road, with a pizza shop directly before you enter the school. all have been there at the same time. we know italians were down there first (restaurants, junkyards, etc), and we know cia was in hollywood/dade doing all kinds of stuff.
           </p>
           <p>
            any chance there's a pattern of/or a triangulation?
           </p>
           <p>
            will post a thread if anybody sees something here.

             If "Italians" is code for Mafia or Organized Crime, then there is definately a correlation. Restaurants are a frequent "legitimate front" in mafias.
            </p>
            <p>
             Junkyards are used to stash weapons and drugs. They can also be used to dispose of a body.

              well, yes, but cia and mafia were only thing there during donna blu flights. not sure what fbi was doing... they all helped create black sites too. explains the rapid development and near, breakneck speed of change, in certain parts of the state. culturally and economically.

                 Seems that county where Coconut Creek is positively infested with organized crime. Russian mafia, La Costra Nostra, Colombo family, Gambino family, Bonano family. That last one is known to be involved in sex trafficking.

            666 is the nuclear code. It's the atomic number of man. who has been trapped in an atomic reality.
           </p>
           <p>
            The Illuminati have always known there is nothing(chaos) betwixt the real and under.

           <p>
            The Seal Of Solomon, is the atomic code. 666.

            Sigma (upper-case Σ, lower-case σ, lower-case in word-final position ς; Greek: σίγμα) is the eighteenth letter of the Greek alphabet. In the system of Greek numerals, it has a value of 200. When used at the end of a word (when the word is not all caps), the final form (ς) is used, e.g. Ὀδυσσεύς &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;(Odysseus)&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Homer's Achilles, is King David.

            Now we have learned Little Caesar is in fact the biblical Jesus and escaped to India and became Buddha and also according to Thomas Aquinas as an avatar of The Peacock Angel, we have learned The Jews didn't killed Jesus and in fact Israel is one of the only places where followers of The Peacock Angel are not persecuted as Devil Worshippers. Another faith there holding high position in society is The Druze, let’s look at who they follow
           </p>
           <p>
            The Druze faith incorporates elements of Islam's Ismailism, Judaism, Christianity, Gnosticism, Neoplatonism, Pythagoreanism, Hinduism
           </p>
           <p>
            The Druze faith is a monotheistic and Abrahamic religion based on the teachings of high Islamicfigures like Hamza ibn-'Ali Ibn Ahmad, Al-Hakim bi Amr Allah and global philosophers like Plato, Aristotle, Socrates.
           </p>
           <p>
            Hold on! Plato?
           </p>
           <p>
            That brings us back to Little Caesar!
           </p>
           <p>
            Socrates taught Plato… Who taught Aristotle, who was the teacher of Alexander The Great.
           </p>
           <p>
            Now Alexander The Great, was a relative of Cleopatra… Who we know was the mother of Little Caesar.
           </p>
           <p>
            He carried a specific quirk in his Pax6 Transcriptor (genetic coder for Eyes and Pineal Gland) which resulted in Heterochromia Iridium (otherwise known as, different coloured eyes)
           </p>
           <p>
            This same very unique genetic quirk, is also responsible for the development of ocular coloboma, the mark that many of the elite carry… Such as our friend Jacob Rothschild (mentioned above) and also… Madeleine McCann.
           </p>
           <p>
            The Cleopatra Line is a B Bloodline. Caesar is an A Bloodline
           </p>
           <p>
            Ramasses is thought to have B Blood… He is also a relative of The Rothschilds.
           </p>
           <p>
            In the film Alien Ark Of The Covenant… There is a poem inscribed on a statue entitled Ozymandias
           </p>
           <p>
            The poem is about Ramasses…
           </p>

            The House Of David… Is The Tree Of Knowledge.
           </p>
           <p>
            Which brings us back to Jacques De Molay, who was crucified in a Doorway for worshipping a Cat and The Messiah…
           </p>
           <p>
            It wasn’t the Jews who crucified The Messiah… It was The Roman Catholic Church

             Dear John,
            </p>
            <p>
             Because the War in Space race is heating up, I felt you should be aware of several factors as you and I schedule our Skype talk.

             They will not tolerate any forms of military violence on Earth or in space.
