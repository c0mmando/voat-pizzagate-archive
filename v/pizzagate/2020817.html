            The only way to combat it is to start a new forum elsewhere, but everytime that has been brought up here the posts get squelched/removed. They don't wanna let the control get away from them. And do you remember the subject M_F banned you for?

            : Can you please repost this with a clearer title and description? What is "it" and "this"? I get the gist that you feel this is directly pizzagate related due to media censorship of child trafficking discussion?  You need to clearly state your research premise. Thanks. Removing per Rule 3. Please repost.

            You're right, Above Top Secret was never a free speech site but it was much freer before. I remember that Rome thread, but the crackdown started much earlier than that. Back when Katrina happened and so many people were bitching about what was going on there, some people from the area that were telling stories about how people were being stopped at gunpoint from helping their neighbors. I felt that the serious modding really kicked in then. You could even point to fark.com because there was a large group and every time something newsworthy would happen there were people from the area that would start to report first-hand versions. They got sold and gutted as well. This is also why rEDIT is so coveted for group-think control. Once a website gets a big enough gathering of people they become a danger because they can so quickly share information.
           </p>
           <p>
            As far as what can be done, I don't think the internet will ever be free again to speak reality. Maybe the dark web, but I know nothing about that and it will probably not bring the large numbers of people required to make a dent in the lies they want to perpetuate.

            It is unfortunate since over the years there have been some decent researchers that came and went on that site. Anyone worth their salt sees what goes on there and don't hang around long. I think that is the ultimate goal of all the conspiracy forums that are left. Break up the like-minded people. Does anyone remember Cyberspace Orbit when that forum first opened? So much fun. Then Stan (I think his name was) was overwhelmed with how many people wanted to talk about this kind of stuff and sent us all over to Elaine's place. Elaine sold out to Trinity aka Godlike and instantly the entire group was gutted. I've seen it happen to every good group since then. There is nowhere left online to discuss fun fringe stuff without being beaten down by all the "skeptics" and trolls. Now on every conspiracy forum it is the same old shit rehashed over and over and over again.
           </p>
           <p>
            btw; if anyone knows of a really good conspiracy forum that is still going let me know. The problem is though that once enough people start going there "they" will shut down or buy out the website and it dies like all the others.

            Never made sense to me either. The mods claim that they are extra careful about what is posted because they don't want to be sued for libel. But considering the topics that Icke writes about, they also delete all kinds of fringe discussion about all kinds of other "conspiracy" type stuff. Considering that Icke has published accusations about many famous people, including the royal family, you would think it wouldn't really matter at this point.

            Icke forum has always been extreme modded. You can't even ask a question about why something was deleted or you get banned. You can't complain or comment about any of the mods or you get banned. It is very tightly controlled. I already commented about the original Savile thread that was there. When that story first broke people were posting shit like crazy. You had to be reading in real time because the mods would delete stuff shortly after it was posted.

             Just as a caveat on the end of all this talk, can we all agree once and for all that the mods here are actually controlled and they do constantly delete vital stuff, try bury posts and allow nonsense ones to stay etc? They do a pretty good job of keeping up appearances and cutting through the cognitive dissonance when questioned, but at the end of the day they are controlled, right? Or no? Or not 100% sure? Personally I feel I've seen about 10 too many discrepancies from them in the past 6 months or so..

              I've seen it so often now I just assume that is the case. I haven't really spent enough time watching what the mods do in this sub but have seen others complaining about it.

               I'm one of the complainers for sure. It makes me wonder sometimes if I'm just extra paranoid because there seems to only be a handful of people that call them out, but then again I'm still always surprised at the relatively low number of visitors on this site. Like in the entire world right now, only 895 people apparently have a pizzagate voat tab opened on their computer!

                I admit, after the Savile thing broke in the UK I lost all hope that anything would ever happen to these people. I watched how the media massaged it all, lulling everyone back to sleep. It seemed like finally there is something big enough to get people to come out of the woodwork, but the system keeps grinding on. People don't want to know, don't want to think about it overall. So I drop by here from time to time to see if anything earth-shattering has come to light but I find it all so depressing and fruitless I can't research the way I used to. If this problem is as big as it seems it is easy pickins for them to infiltrate websites, buy them out, bully them, whatever it takes to silence the few who will come forward when given an opportunity  to communicate their experiences.

                I used to be angry that more people wouldn't come out and just tell the truth, name names and shame those who would hurt children. After seeing so many of them get raked over the coals I can see why they don't. Whistleblowers are demonized and the evil continues.

                 I'm relatively new to this whole world and it's only pizzagate that woke me up. It's astonishing the way they've managed to still keep this one under wraps. I was sure at the start of the year that most would know about this stuff by now, but TPTB have even ramped up their shit and the masses are as oblivious as ever, which is scary. Katy Perry, the lie that is the MSM, 9/11, pizzagate/pedogate, Ted Heath, the satanic superbowl, wikileaks etc are still not enough to wake people up even when presented with the facts somehow. It has certainly been made extremely clear why people don't bother coming forward too, they have a very tight knit system in place to discourage that from happening. This Awan stuff should be interesting though.
