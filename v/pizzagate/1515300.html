Make no mistake. The Norway bust is just a prelude. FBI lead Norway to the pedo ring, FBI is investigating CIA/Clinton Pedo/ChildTrafficking ring.
It was never about Russia hacking, Clinton knew those emails were leaked.
This has always been about CIA/Clinton and child sex trafficking.</p>

            Yes, and every single jew I've told to GTFoff my land because Creator gave it to me, and they're not going to get paid for it has STFU because they don't want to give me back my stolen land. LOL if anyone tried to claim in any court of law that the land is their's "because GOD" would get laughed out of court.

            GIVEN??? GIVEN??? oh yes, it was "given" after they fucking took it.  You clearly have zero real grasp on the history and unsavory actions of zionists prior to and during WWII. Filthy, shameful, and disgusting. Pot and Kettle...Israel and Palestine. That "land" "given" was TAKEN from someone else fucktard.

            Thriving? The US gives that fucking country 10 million a fucking day. I'd not be so fucking proud of that. Despite the fact that they found a rich oil field, Israel sucks as much MONEY (other people's money) that the US taxpayer is the actual owners of Israel. Also racist. Shall I begin to post the videos of how "GOD'S PEOPLE" acting like god, (he did order them to murder an estimated 28 million people in the OT) treat others? Fuck off. Jewish exceptionalism....only with other people's money.

            What I have done, is my homework. Having been brainwashed into Israel=perfect in every way from xian religion to finding out the truth. You're seeing this all over the Internet because people are waking up. Israel STOLE the land people were living on, and are living on. No one is ever going to be happy to be kicked off and denied access to their land. Transfer Agreement and many many other non Palestinian sources to the history of what happened prior to WWII and the zionist cooperation during the war WITH the Nazis..sorry. That old wrist to the forehead woe is me shit...doesn't work anymore. LOL Lying and instigating violence for the last 60 years...that fucking tends to happen when someone else decides you don't have the right to live in your house anymore.

            Trump has an army. If he dies, it will cause a civil war. Our redpilled military will not fight for their side against US citizens. That leaves our side, which is armed to the teeth and has been preparing for this shit for years, against a bunch of commies, college kids, and BLM who are anti gun ownership. It would be a slaughter.

            Of course it's always been about the pedo ring.... that's why the #FakeNews meme exploded after the election. It's been a big coverup since then.... none of the fakenews meme has anything to do with taking credibility back which seems like an obvious cover story for the MSM... it's always been about deniable plausibility about the elitist CP ring and Satanic Ritual Abuse b/c they KNEW the only sites that would be reporting on these claims would be the links on the list of that WashPost article.
           </p>
           <p>
            WashPost never even cited one example of FakeNews... it's all been a Psyop b/c they know people in casual everyday conversations wouldn't have remembered an example anyways, it was a way to get the list ENAMORED in the minds of everyone so if you every approached them in cocktail parties or in private conversation and they asked you for your citation or linked article and you say one of the names on the #FakeNews WashPost list, you'll automatically be labeled a Conspiracy Theorist and be discredited by the mainstream who we are trying to make aware of this tragic issue.

            Of course, when time comes any CP found will be blamed on Russia. They don't even need evidence. The general public is very willing to embrace whatever goes against pizzagate being true as they simply refuse to believe and/or don't want it to be true. This is a very human coping mechanism but also one of the biggest obstacles in convincing people there is really something fishy going on.

            Do what to Israel? The settlements are illegal. How would you like to be living in your house and have someone come and force you out and just take your land? That is shit right there. Israel is also trying for a land grab off Syrian land at the moment.  Are you in the "Israel can do no wrong because God?" camp? Jews been killing people for God since the OT.

              I have never paid attention to politics until this election, I used to believe that the whole thing was rigged and it was pointless. I think the FBI has had their hands tied because of corrupt leadership. Like the xfiles when the FBI had mulder working out of the basement. Hopefully the swamp is drained, there me are both good and bad people in FBI and law enforcement.

            I remember see the story on a couple sites, before it was taken down.  If we could, it's the kind of story we should keep out in social media, and I think wasn't it right around the same time that Norway cut down or off their support of CF?

            heard there were just about 20-30 folks rounded up, but tons of CP -- wasn't sure why it was being called so big, thought it referred to the quadzillionterramacrobytes they found.

            Mods, please flair accuracy: this was never called "fake news," it was simply removed. Accuracy about this kind of thing is important; inaccuracy is a weapon for our opposition. OP, consider removing and resubmitting with an accurate headline.

            Yeah, it looks like there's a significant number of good guys at the FBI, especially at the lower levels. Now, let's not just sit here and wring our hands. What can we DO ABOUT IT?
           </p>
           <ol>
            <li>
             <p>
              Keep getting information about these sickos. The FBI is MORE constrained in their investigations than we are.
             </p>
            </li>
            <li>
             <p>
              Consider ways to reach out and find the good guys at the FBI. Using real names will be incredibly difficult for them, so think of ways that knowledge and cooperation can occur without identification.
             </p>
            </li>

             That was the positive thing about the OP, that there ARE good guys in the FBI.  I do believe that.  Hopefully, more and more will feel safe in coming forward with our new President.

            Did they actually call the Norway thing fake news? I didn't hear that, I just thought it wasn't reported/reports were deleted. If they called it fake news that would've been extremely dumb given that it's been covered by the MSM in many other countries.

             They didn't call it fake news, they just quietly deleted their articles hoping no one would notice. Also telling is how they are completely ignoring and refuse to report on one of the largest pedo/CP busts in history. They found 150 terabytes of CP.

              That sort of bulk is intended for mass consumption.  What are we told the percentage of pedos in the population is? These numbers don't equate to me.

               That's the size of 15000 high quality movies. Or around 1500 movies worth of raw footage. Or 5 years worth of making cp in a basement. If we assume there's 5 filmmakers and 10 hoarders of cp in that bust, less than one year of work is probably enough for that. If just one person digitised or downloaded any movie containing nude scenes of minors (completely legal in the 70s, and still happening in some countries legally), that would also quickly come together.

            One thing to add. Michael Flynn, one of the presidents cabinet picks tweeted out link to a article about this Clinton/PedoTraffickingRing....
2nd, i'm reminded of one of the debates where President elect Trump was describing Clinton's cold hearted reaction to a baby being ripped out of the womb and Clinton saying the govt has no right to tell a woman, "she can't kill her baby"....
President Trump is not with these people, I don't believe so, Breitbart warned us about Podesta's pedo ring and Bannon was close to Breitbart. Breitbart tried to expose these people, he knew even then in 2011, he knew.
President Trump has surrounded himself with men who know.

             Agreed. Trump is in serious danger.  He has even supplemented his Secret Service with private security contractors. He will keep them on after inauguration. A smart move considering what happened to JFK

             <blockquote>
              <p>
               Miller said that Trump’s head of security and body guard Keith Schiller, who was a former New York City policeman and a veteran of the Navy, has been a long-time ally of Trump’s both in business and on the campaign trail.
              </p>
              <p>
               “Now, obviously, the main duties of protecting the President-elect and soon-to-be president are of course done by the Secret Service who does a fantastic job,” Miller added. “This morning’s story was complete nonsense, just blowing it out of proportion.”
