            Also at the Presidio (in SF), MKULTRA army experiments by Michael Achino were carried out there, and people reported seeing men locked up in cages in the basements of buildings there.  Tunnels would be something the perpetrators would use no doubt.  That is what Pelosi was probably hiding, and that they are most likely still using the tunnels for pedophile parties.  The Presidio is also very close to Senator Diane Feinstein's palatial house and the biggest Jewish temple in the Bay Area.  Feinstein's husband is Richard Blum, CEO of the Univ of Calif. (head of the Board of Regents), and very involved with all aspects of UC, as well as doing business with the Carlyle Group (started by George H.W. Bush, biggest pedophile pusher in the world).  Blum has over $750 million invested in his student loan company - loans with such high interest that students can never pay them back.  The conditions for the loans (inherited debt) are that the loans if not paid by student, have to be paid by parents of the student, or by the unborn future children of the student.  UC is also run by the Jesuits and is very involved with the House of Farnase (Fidel Castro's Italian Ducal family descended from Pope Paul III, the founder of the Jesuits).

            This is fucking blatant, in your face. Who the fuck names a pizza place after a goat? of all things (that have nothing to do with pizza) except a sick fucking witch like Pelosi. And with goats on the adverts and all that shit. This bitch is a witch.

            "Philip DeAndrade—a former government staff member under Pelosi—is listed as the owner of Goat Hill Pizza. His email is also
            <a class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="d080b8b9bcb9a09097bfb1a498b9bcbcfeb3bfbd" href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection">

            . Could it possibly be? Could Philip and Nancy Pelosi be one in the same? Undoubtedly, yes. "
           </p>
           <p>
            "Broken down, here are the steps Pelosi takes to wash the money clean of any connections so that it can be donated to a political campaign without violating the Hatch Act and ending up on the Clinton Foundation’s list of people in need of arresting.
           </p>
           <p>
            Step 1: The real Philip DeAndrade, under Pelosi’s instruction, buys a legitimate business under his real name when he isn’t working for the government any longer.
Step 2: Nancy Pelosi, like an idiot, puts her own real name on the email signup for GoatHill.com, thus making herself into Philip online and providing a paper trail for us to find."

            Recall how she suddenly switched to being so chummy with Hillary? During the primaries ... at the end.
Maybe she joined the pizza party then.

            The Yelp reviews do have some parallels with Comet IMO. It seems like both location have a lot of reviews and they are both pretty polarizing. The Comet one freaked me out more, although I just came across this yelper in 2012 who had this to say
           </p>
           <p>
            "One word: OVERRATED.
           </p>
           <p>
            The ingredients are decent, the cheese and sauce are ok, but I swear to god, the pizza SMELLS FUNNY! At first I thought it was the particular pie I ordered (a "Californian," I think it's called) but then two subsequent times I noticed it as well." Also I read a lot of reviews about rude, incompetent staff, and they refuse to deliver to a lot of the people too even though they were close.
           </p>
           <p>
            Here's one from 2010 talking about kids drawings on the walls "I came here with my friends because my friend had the groupon deal for it. This was also my last American meal before going to HK for 5 months, and I was not very satisfied. I was quite happy at the beginning of the meal before the food came because I saw drawings on the wall done by students of the elementary school I attended. I haven't visited Potrero Hill since, but it got me nostalgic" She goes onto say that that the food sucked.

             Here's one more along the lines of comet ping pongs with complaints of too many screaming children Worst pizza I've ever had. The center of the pizza was extremely soggy. The cheese was not good. Crust was awful. Absolutely dreadful. I ate one slice and when the waiter asked if I wanted to take it home, I said no. He asked again, are you sure? I said, absolutely sure.
            </p>
            <p>
             Dining experience: really awful. The room was filled with little children, one of whom was screaming all the time. If you like kids, this is for you. If not, run away.

              Alright here is the last yelp review on the list a woman from 2007. What a messed up experience:  We took some German friends there last night; party of 10 (some well behaved kids were with us).  From the moment we got there, we were informed of the RULES of the dive in an army style manner.   All of the staff, besides the servers (my son pointed out that they were very nice) were unbelievably rude.  If felt almost like a joke, but it wasn't...my husband arrived and wanted to sit with us; some nutty waitress jumped towards the table and forbade him to sit down, "sorry against the rules, which are strictly enforced".  She yelled at me as I offered him a piece of my pizza.  He was ordered to sit at a table near ours.  He left the place.  I asked for the manager; some large-framed pressure cooker.  I am a very polite person and tried to get our feelings across-nope: "We don't want you here, you can leave"...Well, ... what to say; "Better service in former East Germany", my friend added.  The kids were stunned...So are we.  What the heck?!?!
             </p>
             <p>
              It seems like these pizza places don't really want the general population in their restaurants. Their food is bad and overpriced. Like when they kicked that Jack guy out of Comet Ping Pong for Periscoping. I might eat pizza again but I'm def gonna scope out the business and think twice before I do.

            Hey, so I was trying to see if there was a protected section on the site, which led me to this address. Seems to be the base address or whatever it's called without the domain.
            <a href="http://goathillpizza1.localon.com">
             http://goathillpizza1.localon.com
            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            So I looked for it without the one, old version of site. Probably nothing, but main photo of kid eating pizza is so creepy on this one. Ick.

            and then download the zip before you post, it takes a mere second or two. Let's stay a step ahead of these fucks.

            This pizza place isn't even trying to look non-creepy. Actually, I think they're trying to be creepy on purpose. I'd avoid this pizza place like the plague even if I didn't know a thing about #Pizzagate. What the heck.

            Awesome find, though. The fact that Pelosi used the domain for her emails is highly bizarre.

            1 none of those photos are photos that I would use on an official website (including the non-kid photos), because they're just poor photos. And the whole website looks really cheap. It's in San Francisco - your business has to be VERY successful to be able to operate with the rent prices there. Customers would expect very high quality service. So, why does the website look terrible?
           </p>
           <p>
            2 specifically on the kid photos - if they're advertising as a family restaurant, why wouldn't they have pictures of
            <em>
             families
            </em>
            rather than individual kids with no adults? This is the same faulty logic in Alefantis' instagram photos. Oh, she was taped to the table for a game? Then wouldn't her parents or siblings or friends be playing too? It's weird that all of these pics are of single kids.
           </p>
           <p>
            3 Has anyone else ever come across a rewards program that tracks points by email? I'm familiar with rewards cards or hole punch cards, but I've never heard of one that uses email. Maybe it's a new thing. Anyone want to sign up and see if there's anything fishy about it?

            Ah Goat Hill Pizza, I remember their delicious pizza well. They are a chain now. The original one is on Potrero Hill. A potrero is a grazing area, in this case for goats. Voat/goat, coincidence?!
