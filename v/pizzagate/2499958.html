<p>As far as this blind goes, and as an interesting metaphor, imagine you inherit your dad\'s big house. Your old Pop has been in the nursing home many years, and was close to your male cousin. The cousin has been living there and paying HUGE rent to your Dad which he shared with the whole family. But your cousin just got kicked out and moved out. Because neighbors and locals on Facebook began gossiping about rumors that the cousin was doing something bad in that house. So Pop\'s lawyers had him evicted. </p>
<p>When you decide to remodel the house so you can sell it for big bucks - you discover hidden horrors. That there was a secret dungeon room in the basement where your cousin abused kids. That he\'d installed hidden cameras and had a kiddie porn operation. Even though your dad was in the nursing home, he enjoyed the tons of money your cousin paid him in rent. Your family was unknowingly complicit for taking that big rent money all this time, and it turns out your senile old Dad had secrets too, which your cousin used to blackmail him. They protected each other, but Pop is too old now to care and times change. </p>
<p>You go talk to the cops who tell you that so much time has passed they can\'t do much. Even the evidence is tricky because of the high standard to prosecute and get a conviction. The D.A. hesitates because your cousin and Dad have pals who are big contributors. The victims won\'t testify against your cousin (or are scared they\'ll ruin their own careers/lives/families) and your Dad\'s dementia means he\'s unreliable. </p>
<p>So what do you do? Do you invite reporters in for a big story that will reveal all - even though it\'ll have little effect? Do you risk your cousin suing you for defamation/slander since the victims are scared to go on record? And NOW - the BIGGIE: Since your goal is to sell the house...you risk killing the value of the home. Because nobody wants to buy or be associated with a house of horrors. Who wants their kids to grow up there? Or risk being bullied at school about their new house? So would you just forget it all, finish the remodel, and sell it? Or destroy your house\'s value and make a big trending fury by exposing it - ALL FOR NOTHING?</p>
<p>That\'s an analogy of the situation at the studio/corporation now. I\'m not saying the boss lady is innocent nor am I saying the Producer pervert is walking away free and clean. It\'s a fluid, real time situation. Lawyers ARE involved and the big MEDIA are watching every move closely trying to get victims to go on record. I do think those coming forward are building up to the pervert\'s downfall. He\'s already lost his deal; and no big studio/company is willing to partner with or back him. They know the stories and the pressure and because of what\'s been said on gossip sites and social media - they don\'t wanna be in biz with him and risk it now in this Time\'s Up era. So that\'s a good thing. </p>
<p>Just watch closely at what happens next, and the moves being made. It never comes fast enough but it may eventually lead to justice. We just have to see. Just know that due to the efforts of a LOT of people - his sins are catching up to him. As long as people know it and continue keeping it alive, he\'ll carry that weight around his neck until it snaps. It\'s all about time.&quot;</p>',

            There are lawyers working on filing a huge lawsuit but unless they go public with their victims their clients it will be settled for a lot of money without any news breaking about it. Lawyers are smart they know they can get tens of millions of dollars from Viacom and Nickelodeon. Or if we are lucky Jamie Lynn Spears will announce Dan raped her when she was 14 or 15 and her daughter is Dan's the girl looks exactly like Fatso Schneider in the face the eyes the unibrow eyebrows he's her dad and that could get him arrested for sure. Or Jamie Lynn might want a lot more money then it gets no publicity at all she gets another 10 million bucks from Dan and Nickelodeon and he never gets arrested.

            I really, really, REALLY hope that Himmmm is right about this, and his deeds are going to catch up to him. It's so incredibly frustrating to have to wait any length of time for something like this, but it sounds like the situation is hopeful, at least. What we all need to do is help keep this story alive, don't let it fade out of relevance, and vocally support any victims that come out, and share their stories far and wide.
           </p>
           <p>
            Also, I really hope the dungeon metaphor was just a metaphor...

             That seems to be how the metaphor is structured, yes. I would assume that the 'dad' is Sumner Redstone.

            Times change, don't they? I think Schneider, one way or another, will reap the harvest he has sown. Probably sooner than later.

            I used to be interested in cdcn but now I suspect heavily that it is controlled opposition. Freemasons rule the show and they are ruled mainly by the number 33 among other things and other numbers. In numerology, which is their jam, Himmmm adds to 33 on the nose. Crazy Days and Crazy Nights also adds to 33. People says Himmmm is shared account by Robert Downy Jr and others. I like Robert’s acting but he’s is not what he seems. I won’t say why, no one here would want to believe it.

            Don’t think for second Nickelodeon didn’t know what they were getting when they hired Schneider. He got hired BECAUSE he is a pedo. And also he was raised by a CIA father. And he was groomed to be a cia asset specializing in mk and procuring young girls.
           </p>
           <p>
            There are a bunch bunch of directors and producers at nickelodeon that also do what Scheider does. It’s no accident. No day of the rope is coming.

            Understand, you’re only getting half truths with this cdcn.

             The only important thing is that some truth is getting out. It stands to reason that one should "believe everything and believe nothing", when doing research, and "being fed" information from the very community we are investigating.
