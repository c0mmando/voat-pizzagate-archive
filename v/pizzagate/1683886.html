            You guys?  Last time I checked, it was me saying it.  I'm singular.
            <br/>
            Your speech was nice, but inaccurate as all hell (no pun intended).
Lets review something, shall we?
1960, homosexuality in these united states.    Portrayed in media and in general consensus, as a perversion, to say the least.   Not even Hollywood would portray it as less than strange.
            <br/>
            Then a funny thing happened on the way to a mind controlled society.   The media and entertainment industry changed lanes regarding homosexuality, gradually, incrementally, increasingly, all the while shifting opinion sides more and more towards the (once reviled) gay side.   Most people today (who are essentially oblivious to the mind fucking they've endured most of their lives) say it was because of "education", or the movement to enlighten society.     When in fact, we the people were mind fucked en masse, in a very short period of time, relatively speaking.   Compared to how homosexuality was viewed for centuries, with a decade or two, and voila, its not only accepted, its protected, celebrated, and IF you are one of the remaining Neanderthals who does NOT view it in the highest esteem, YOU are the one relegated to the dumpster of society.  Instantly.
            <br/>
            Do I HAVE to expand on this?  Are you REALLY going to argue or have some kind of intellectual gobbeldy-fucking-goop discussion on the "nuances" of what I said???
Ok, good.  onto to pedophilia. 
It was accepted AND celebrated in cultures past.  Like, ancient Rome and Greece, f'rinstance.  And Egypt.   And actually it has been in existence in some degree of acceptance in many cultures and societies throughout history.  From Japanese to celtic.
It existence today can best be illustrated by one very public one very well known pedophile, Jimmy Savile of England.   He showed the world how accepted the practice is, to the point that even though it was publicly KNOWN what and who he was, he not only was allowed to continue being so, he was Knighted by the Queen . THAT, speaks volumes.    Currently we have seen a lot of stories in the news regarding pedophiles, and stories like the Zandvoort Files  show us the extent it is covered up in society, even by law enforcement personnel and governments.
            <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r7v5tPWk7EU">
             https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r7v5tPWk7EU
            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            Government already has the extreme authority to do whateverthehell they want, and they are doing it.   Watch that video I linked.  Theres your proof. 
The push is underway to make it publicly acceptable in a culture that just a few decades ago, viewed homosexuality as a perversion, and disgusting.    Exactly how pedophiles are viewed today . AND, the same defense will be used for pedophiles that were used to promote acceptance of homosexuals.  Know what that is?  "they were born that way".   "can't be fixed or changed".    Watch.    And remember where you heard it first.  Oh sure, the American Psychological assoc. has been saying that for DECADES, but the American public still believes they are sick perverts.   (theres a lot in that sentence too for anyone with eyes and a brain).    The push is on.
            <br/>
            First, it will be humor, and short doses of it.  Then,  "what IF" scenario discussions/plots.  Most likely on tv shows and movies.  You know, to get people to "think". (actually, to get them to NOT think, but rather, accept)
           </p>
           <p>
            And if anyone reading this thinks Trump will stop it, you're out of your fucking minds. 
And, for the record, I'm against pedophilia as a practice.   Just in case some nit wit makes that idiotic accusation.
            <br/>
            Now, fire away.

            "designed to be a free country"?!?  And you tell ME to get with the comprehension program!?
The prison system causes more problems than it solves.  Agreed. 
Point is, we either lock up known convicted pedophiles FOREVER,  or banish them SOMEHOW, from society, forever.
            <br/>
            That sentence is not in fact, cruel and unusual. 
And I'm not melting into a puddle of anything.  I am one of the very few aware folks who SEES what the hell is happening to our society.
            <br/>
            I don't believe the "war on terror" bullshit, I don't believe in Democrats or Republicans (or goddam idiot libertarians), and I for damn sure don't believe America is "free" (or the "good guy").
Read that last sentence a few more times.    It indicates that I'm about 6 laps ahead of you in the comprehension race, and that's just the tip of the iceberg.
            <br/>
            This thread is specifically about pedophiles, and what I believe is the current push begun to make IT acceptable  in our society.
            <br/>
            They cannot, by definition, be allowed to be free in our society at large.  Period.

            You just ranted about how bad prisons are, now you're suggesting prisons.
            <br/>
            "we need to take responsibility too?"
what the hell does THAT mean?   We parents have to watch our kids BETTER?  Fuck that.  Eliminate, remove, neutralize THREATS, don't enable the threats to mingle in the name of "kinder gentler justice".
            <br/>
            I'm all for humane incarceration.   I'm not sacrificing my or other kids for that purpose though.    They CANT be reformed, according to psychological experts.

            I like to think that is the main reason all the children have not been rescued in mass, nobody has any idea what to do with so many damaged souls at one time, there are likely hundreds of thousands maybe many more..
           </p>
           <p>
            The kids will probably need a new form of therapy, invented for them possibly by them, maybe the child regression therapy would work, I am not sure really. I don't think our current mental health models are equipped to handle it, They would certainly have very messed up sexualities, but no I don't advocate killing them. I do believe they should get mental help. Maybe some of the virtual reality technologies coming out in the near future could help them cope. I think in extreme situations like that ultimately they must want to help themselves.

            On one hand I want to agree that people should not be punished for their thoughts, but I also think anyone one messed up enough to think about touching a child does not deserve that right, for all I know they have already made the choice and are just waiting for the opportunity. I guess I just don't believe in "Non Offending Pedophiles", I am also not excited about the day I get fooled into bed by a transgender...but it isn't like I would take it out on him/her considering I am not an innocent child.

            The small teens in porn is actually why I stopped watching porn, stopped masturbating or sexualizing anything, and decided to focus only on what mattered to me and the people I love. That was years ago. I was wholly disgusted, and I am pretty confident these days that most porn stars are sex slaves and the industry is inseparable from globalist agenda

            I think transgenderism is a pretty mild comparison, I am happy that you were able to find the root of your problem and able to move toward a positive and balanced lifestyle, it gives me a small amount of hope. With that said, I think it is quite rare for a person to do that and even more unlikely that it could happen for people as sick as child molesters. When you say "self childhood regression therapy" do you mean that you did it yourself? Most of these child molesters could never help themselves because they do not view it as even being a problem, they view it more like getting even with god, to me it seems too much like trying to teach a serial killer to have compassion. We have a long way to go in understanding the nuances of mental health disorders.

            A lot of non offending pedos do not feel like they have a problem, they are secretly hoping and pushing for society to change, they feel it is only a problem after they hurt a child.  It is also totally possible many child abusers were themselves never abused. I do not agree every problem can be fixed pedophilia being one of those problems. Being a child molester is not like being a heroin addict, or an alcohol abuser. It is more like being a serial killer

            Having a society of people that are not attracted to sexualized children seems a more logical route, I believe that a proper society would not even allow the opportunity for children to be abused, I don't want to sound like a totalitarian purist, but certain things should be monitored and controlled especially things concerning the innocence of a child. I agree it is a complicated issue, but pandering to criminals, idiots, and pedophile apologists is not the way to go in my opinion. A lot more people are sick than they realize or would admit, hell bestiality is still legal in Nevada for instance. We have a long way to go either way.

            Bleeding hearts like you are beyond reeducation, you sound like a pedophile apologist anyway, we are rapidly heading toward this 'dystopian society bs' that you speak of. So i may get my wish. I would gladly live in '1984'  if pedophiles, offending or not, don't exist.

            Now comment on my comments.
You can't reform them, and you damn sure can't trust em, so what do you do with people who prey on innocent children?  Banish, or kill?
Castration doesn't work, by the by.   It's been tried.

            All parents should secretly bug all children to purge all pedophiles. I personally think non offending pedophiles would still offend if they felt they could get away with it despite maybe 'feeling bad about it', these people are beyond fucked whether it happened to them as a child does not matter and is not a valid argument, so sad for them but they should still hang like the innocence destroying monsters they are. If i had a chomo family member I wouldn't want them to get treatment I would want them to hang, no questions, hell i wouldn't even mind hanging them myself.

            Right? Glad someone saw that, didn't want that to get buried in the comments. We're going to see more and more of this utter shite peddled in the MSM, because they know the noose is getting tight around their necks. I believe the term is conditioning or subversive programming, trying to get a favorable outcome in the event that these scumbags see their day in court. Trying to set the standard that these people are sick and thus no jail time is in order.

            I think non offending pedophile and actual child molesters are both a danger to children and society as such they should be dealt with, whether through reeducation or execution .. same goes with pedo apologists and muslimes.

            :edit: I would happily give up almost all of my 'freedoms' if it would mean the eradication of pedophilia in all forms

            This was today's UK Daily Mail.  Causing an outcry in the U.K. right now.  Seems the Chief Police Officer for Child Exploitation Crime deems there to be  'lower levels' of paedophilia - i.e. Those who just look at the pictures but dont go any further.

            i noticed the pro-pedos have flooded this site, maybe trying to bury all this new info and evidence coming out with pedo apologists and downplaying. We need to stick to the investigation and the mods need to do a better job at identifying these apologists and ban them.

            They need a bullet behind the ear, not therapy.  Alcoholism or a rocky marriage is not the same as raping and sacrificing kids to satan...or getting married to a same sex partner and adopting a kid to rape daily.  People like you think that its better that pedos look at child porn so they dont act on their urges, while discounting the fact that children must be harmedto make the child porn these pedos need to maintain control of their rape impulses...please pull your head out of your ass. As someone who was also abused as a child its shocking to me that you cant see wtf i am talking about, or that this even needs to be explained to you. I think you are either really messed up in the head still and you need help or you are a victim that has become a pedo themselves and now you are trying to justify it to yourself more than me.

            It's estimated 30% of congress dem. and rep. are caught up in pedophillia. 
They need to all be brought down and put into prison. An example needs to be made of them, that this doesn't happen again.
Clinton's law incentivised puting kids in these foster homes where they are being trafficked and abused.

            The pedophiles want society to normalize their behavior like they've done with homosexuality.

            I don't think people at large have any sympathy for offending pedos. That's one of the angles the media uses to ease us into normalization.

            The abused tend to become the abusers. You being a victim sucks but that doesnt justify supporting and condoning pedophiles. They cant be rehabilitated because they are influenced by dark supernatural influences and they are predators. If someone has pedo urges its only a matter of time before they act on it. The people claiming to be non practicing pedos are a psyop to put a human face on a horrific practice to normalize pedophilia and make it acceptable to the masses. It is a widely coordinated movement starting with the governments un and global elites and royals and their satanic practices. They control the media that is normalizing this shit. Twitter reddit and youtube and facebook all encourage lgbt/pedo shit aswell as the radio. Congrats you have been victimized twice once physically and now by their faggot/pedo trojan horse united nations child sex rights propaganda. The people behind lgbt started the pedo movement they are monsters and they should be put to death. They are an abomination against god. I am not going to kill anyone, but i am also not going to call god wrong when multiple times he says to kill them. So sad for you that you got abused but fuck off, because you are trying to justify pedophilia

            At the very least there could be more social media outrage over the groups that openly advocate pedophilia. This could be a good chance to use #pedogate rather than pizzagate, not to replace it but to open up the conversation.

            the problem with your approach is that it only works in a functioning society.

            What we learn from pedogate is that if rape is about power not sex, then paedophilia is about ultimate power.  When a paedophile mafia infiltrates the halls of power it will grow in the shadows until all social institutions - especially as refers to justice and the safety of children - are destroyed and perverted to the opposite of their stated cause.
           </p>
           <p>
            Paedophilia is not just the most deprived crime to visit upon children, it is the crucible for the destruction of a civilization itself. As it destroys the artificial social mechanisms of justice, we must revert to our foundation as mammals to find natural justice: loathing and hatred should not be untempered, but they are our only available motivators to give us the courage to overcome the brutal power structure defending the paedostocracy. Absolute fear must be instilled in those contemplating paedophilia - enough fear to over-rule desire (of gratification OR power)

             The problem with your statement is that Pizzagate, as an investigation, would not exist in a non-functioning society. The fact that we are here discussing this is evidence that barbarism is not the only recourse we have.

              I disagree with your contention. Communication still occurs in non functioning societies. Overlords do not reduce everything to rubble; they maintain what infrastructure they need to keep themselves in privilege. That infrastructure alone doth not a functioning society make.

               But a nonfunctional society does not question its rulers or the rules; they sit silent, subdued, and subservient. Again, the fact that we conspire to unravel their machinations is evidence that we are plenty functional, especially since we are willing to operate independently to usurp them.

            Not going to disagree with you on principle, but if the psychiatric world believes that pedophiles cannot in fact, be "rehabilitated" (changed), then the options are few.
            <br/>
            Death, or banishment, for the safety of innocent children . They deserve as much.
            <br/>
            Now how you chose to banish is up for debate.  But those found to exhibit such behaviors cannot mix in our society.   Cannot.

            I'm sorry, if the term  "consenting adults" is not "loud" and "clear", I don't think anyone will understand the evil of preying on children to train them to be a sex slave/life partner.  As a nation we're coming real close to understanding that, but we've still a long way to go.

            agreed - this is the ROOT of the problem.  but beyond pedophilia, don't we have evidence or reports of child trafficking, rape, and murder?

             Yes, we will need to take down an entire criminal ring operating with collusion of the U.S. Government.  I think we need to catch them and try them humanely and sentence them according to their individual crimes, only showing mercy to those who expose their leaders.  We must get at the people at the top and that will take time and the patience of Job.

             Take the amount of tax money spent on for-profit wars, black projects and other slush funds used to put together trafficking/pedo networks and put that amount into the research of identifying some type of genetic indicator and/or brain wave pattern of a pedophile.
            </p>
            <p>
             Show them a picture of a child and measure their response. I bet you even the most conditioned and trained of pedophiles have something trigger in their subconscious.
            </p>
            <p>
             We know a lot of these billionaires are very much into genetics so it would be using their own weapon against them.

             These people should be heavily studied, not just thrown in a pit to rot or arbitrarily killed just to feed your own blood lust of resentment for their actions.
