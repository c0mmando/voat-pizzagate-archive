<p>Cheryl Hersha was born into an Illuminati Bloodline Family in 1961. Her parents hailed from 2 of the 13 different bloodlines, but her Father\'s Bloodline Family, Die Familie [pronounced Dee Fah-meal-ee-uh] who had immigrated from Germany to America, was the Family that controlled her young life.</p>
<p>Cheryl was subjected to Satanic Ritual Abuse by her paternal grandparents and father from birth; the Illuminati\'s trauma-based mind control programming began, as is standard in all Illum. Families, at the age of 2yrs. Her mother was non-compliant, and underwent the same mind control techniques, as did her two siblings.
Cheryl and her older sister, Lynn, were also placed in the MKUltra/Monarch Program in 1965, as her paternal step-grandfather was OSS as it morphed into the CIA, was her father\'s &quot;Handler&quot;, and had him sign the two girls up for the program.</p>

            For me Cheryl Hershsa's testimony rings true.  I don't have a crystal ball.  What others seem to find confusing in both Cheryl and Cathy's speaking is what make's it sound accurate to me. Memory returns in bursts from time frames colored by drugs and hypnosis, just for starters.   It is a purposeful confounding/shattering of the child's sense of self and memory from a pre-verbal point in their life.  As adults, survivors are making the most sense of it that they can, for themselves and others.

           <p>
            Putting yourself in those shoes is a good beginning place.  Your drunk on a Ferris-wheel, nothing is going right, you feel like throwing up, but someone else is driving the car and isn't ready to leave for hours more. Your trying to impress a girl/boy friend.  You may have passed out, you can't remember the whole night fully.   Now decades later, try and explain to others,  in a comprehensible fashion, your experiences that night.  It's sort of like that, the raw material is jumbled.

            Didn't have my thinking cap on, was more taken back by the tacky channel intro and lack of apparent interest from the interviewer(reading from queue cards made me think she's not really invested in the material itself, just what it might net for her to 'interview an insider')

            Remember that almost all MKUtra victims are excellent liars and manipulators. They are taught to be. That is why a lot of times the victims act &amp; sound so unbelievable. They are often drugged and so memories are clouded.
Other times they can recite events exactly like they happened. Its all done to ensure that if they tell, no one will believe them. Evil!

              Nope. I have no doubt she is telling the truth. Just was explaining how sometimes victims come across as "scattered" and seem to be making up shit.  For instance Cathy Agnew!
Her posts pre pizzagate, very "scattered" many would say totally unbelievable, however very consistant! This is what the victim's handlers want, so if the victims ever speak out, no one believes them! 
Have you ever known a child who can't help but constantly "lie" even when there is no need to lie? If, you dig  I would say 70+% of the time those kids have had some kind of abuse/ manipulation placed on them from early in childhood. Like, at home a certain behavior is excepted, however when in public that behavior is hidden, told not to tell about things at home. Being told "what happens at home is private" then if someone outside the home questions something, the child is allowed to say anything but. Realizing that lies have a reward from the manipulator. The lie becomes the victims truth. Exactly, why you always hear, that if you repeat a lie enough times you start to believe it!

             That is true. It's so sad. It's still hard to wrap my mind around it all. I can't imagine how someone can do that to another human being. Especially an innocent child. They just crush their spirit.

              The pedophocracy pathocracy is real. These are satanic psychopaths. They are evil enough that it'd be a crime to consider them human.
