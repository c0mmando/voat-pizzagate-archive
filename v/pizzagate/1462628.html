            Your claim of having to type out "Pizzagate Saudi CON. N.E.B" is false. I simply highlighted "Pizzagate conneb saudi" in chrome, right-clicked, searched Google, and the hits come up as they did previously.

            Additionally, there is zero evidence that any lots in the 5000-5100 range of Connecticut Ave were "sold for free". Just because the records show a 0.00 selling price, doesn't mean that it was sold for that price. Often, any time there is a new deed, or a change in a deed, or a refinance of a mortgage, the "selling price" gets reported as 0.00 on the tax assessor website.
