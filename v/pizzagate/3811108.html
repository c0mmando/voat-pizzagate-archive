              Today my complete focus is to write something up. I would love to run it past you first when finished. You have been a tremendous guide on this journey. Karma will be kind to you.

              This is absolutely amazing. I'm currently doing some digging, I'll take your advice and not say much but or where. I think dots are connected but want it to present it better than my first run of throwing out a bunch of stuff. I feel credibility is lost if you can point to the whole and say " well 20% is false, so this is garbage " Focusing on the 80% and making it 100% is the goal.

              Hey yeah I'm good. Not going to lie, getting banned from Reddit and Voat going down was pretty spooky. Especially since I went out of town for the weekend... The good news I'll be back tonight and a little more organized!

               Unfortunately no. I agree, despite my better judgement I am hoping he's just dropped the research or is caught up with something else.

            flimsy evidence tbh. A nice flow chart and randomly finding people 1 or 2 people out of hundreds of thousands of people(hospital and la/hollywood area) is not evidence. One of the findings says a review said 'good pizza, good chicken and waffles'.. yeah it's a restaurant..
           </p>
           <p>
            Maybe I am not seeing it, but this just seems like you found 1 or 2 bad people out of hundreds of thousand, and try to put circumstantial flimsy evidence.

             No one is claiming to have hard evidence at this point. The point of research is go through the exercise of identifying what is something and what is nothing. If something smells funny, you rummage through your fridge to find what is rotten...don't you?

              The issue is the hive mind is too stupid to determine real from imagination. So they effectively will say X is guilty of this when it isn't. And then no one in the public will believe pizzagate. It will be seen as a place that will not disavow schizophrenics or get rid of them.. So as of now pizzagate researchers are 70% schizophrenic.  T

               I see your point. People can and do jump to conclusions quickly, have confirmation biases, etc. People are also quick to make up statistics and dole out psychological diagnoses without being qualified to do so.

            This was created to help me visualize connections and process information. There will be things that are missing and incomplete. Please feel free to bring those to my attention. This is a draft that I will add to and revise as info develops. The right half of the chart (nicainc.org) is less fleshed out. There is a TON of info here to dissect.
           </p>
           <p>
            Solid lines are considered to be more solid connections. Dashed lines are leads but not absolutely verifiable connections.

               You archived a lot that will help, but I believe it is more the pins on google maps that are missing if I am not mistaken...

              <p>
               The google map pins said the name Nica and showed a pizza place located over a home in Bel Air - also a church and a welding co and some more different businesses but all had the same number.
              </p>
              <p>
               I didn't ask you to archive or screenshot those, or link them specifically, it is my fault if they are lost.

                We need to archive the google maps pins and the google reviews for Nica Pizza Delivery, Nica Welder, Nica Chapel, and Nica Global. These items are missing. Please and thank you.

            Did a reverse number search for (626) 261-4500 (the number linked to the Niaca global house) Registered to a Sam K Kioko from covina california. Doing some digging on this guy came up with two company names, he is listed as the agent for Kiowanexus Inc. and is the founder of Wanjiku foundation. This is some pretty curious stuff but unfortunately the trail goes cold as I can't really find anymore information on these two companies or this guy. I'm going to keep tracing all the numbers of the known nica locations and post anything I find interesting.  If anyone else can turn anything up from the Sam Kioko trail let me know.

            The Secrets of Cedars-Sinai, Hollywood's Glamour Hospital -
            <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/cedars-sinai-hospital-354462">
             https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/cedars-sinai-hospital-354462
            </a>
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             From birthing room to deathbed, no institution in L.A. can claim anywhere near as emotionally central or uniquely sweeping a hold on the entertainment industry as the internationally renowned Cedars-Sinai Medical Center. Whether it's Patrick Swayze fighting pancreatic cancer, Frank Sinatra dying of a heart attack, Madonna undergoing hernia surgery, Jessica Simpson having a baby -- or untold behind-the-scenes business players privately tending to the health of themselves and their loved ones -- Hollywood's hospital is almost inevitably involved. ..
            </p>
            <p>
             "It's a big part of the good times and the bad," says Gersh partner Leslie Siebert, who's active with Cedars' Women's Guild and was born at the hospital, as were her kids. Adds Jeffrey Katzenberg, a Cedars board member since 1998, who says he has never lived more than a mile from the campus during his time in town: "I know the facility very well as a user. Every medical emergency has been there, those breaks and those sprains. My in-laws passed away there; my children were born there. It's defined my life in an essential way, as it has for so many people in our industry."
            </p>
            <p>
             ..t's hard to imagine it was founded as a 12-bed facility in a Victorian house near downtown in 1902. Then called Kaspare Cohn Hospital, it was run by the Hebrew Benevolent Society. Later renamed Cedars of Lebanon, an Old Testament reference to the timber used for Solomon's Temple, it expanded into a grand Art Deco building on Fountain Avenue in Hollywood and tapped the wallets of film moguls Jack Warner and Joseph Schenck, as well as Will Rogers. (In 1976, that property would be purchased by the Church of Scientology for its West Coast headquarters and painted bright blue.) After World War II, Al Jolson deeded his two-acre estate on Mulholland Drive to assist in a $1 million drive toward construction of a maternity and pediatrics pavilion to handle the post-war baby boom.
            </p>
            <p>
             Meanwhile, another Jewish hospital, the Mount Sinai Home for the Incurables -- which soon decided to go by the only slightly less depressing Home for the Chronic Invalids -- opened in 1926 in Yiddish-speaking, working-class East L.A. In 1928 Louis B. Mayer held a big Hollywood Roosevelt Hotel fund-raiser to help underwrite hospital-stays coverage at $2 a day. Everyone from Norma Shearer and Joan Crawford to Barbara Stanwyck and George Raft attended and even performed at its gala events, often at the urging of the Jewish studio heads who were their bosses.
            </p>
            <p>
             Cedars' Fountain Avenue facility, located near the Paramount lot, couldn't help but become an industry magnet. Marilyn Monroe had her appendix removed there in 1952. (She taped a note to her abdomen under her gown, imploring the doctor to cut as little as possible: "I know it seems vain … please do whatever you can to prevent large scars."). One time, when Elizabeth Taylor was staying on the fifth floor, Richard Burton had Chasen's send over dinner -- and, to boot, ordered in a pair of the restaurant's tuxedoed violinists to play. One of the hospital's most frequent patients was Peter Sellers. "Lovely guy; his heart stopped all the time," says Barbara Marshall, director Garry Marshall's wife, who was an ICU nurse in the early 1960s, before the use of electric defibrillation paddles. "We used to jump up on the bed and pound him on the chest. I think I did it nine times."

             After Cedars merged with Mount Sinai in 1961, in part so the Jewish hospitals would no longer need to compete on the fund-raising front, it began drawing financial support from Jules C. Stein and Lew and Edie Wasserman, as well as TV- and radio-spot fund-raising assistance from Charlton Heston and Jack Lemmon. By this time, Mount Sinai had migrated to the increasingly Jewish Westside to a location at the still far-from-chic intersection of Beverly Boulevard and San Vicente Boulevard, a neighborhood then defined by its unsightly oil derricks, barbecue joints and pony rides. (Chanel wouldn't hang its shingle a stethoscope's toss away on Robertson Boulevard for nearly half a century.) When the two facilities formally became one on the site in 1976, the new centerpiece tower was named after Hollywood makeup kingpin Max Factor, whose family foundation provided pivotal philanthropic support with a then-unprecedented $4 million gift in 1972, while the Debbie Reynolds-backed Thalians Mental Health Center (closed earlier this year) anchored another portion of the property.
            </p>
            <p>
             In time, Steven Spielberg, TV game show producer Mark Goodson (Family Feud, The Price Is Right) and former 20th Century Fox owner Marvin Davis would have buildings named after them to acknowledge multimillion-dollar gifts, while programs in hereditary and colon cancer and brain tumors would be titled for, respectively, Gilda Radner, Sharon Osbourne and attorney Johnnie L. Cochran Jr. In addition, the two public streets that intersect the campus were named George Burns Road and Gracie Allen Drive, after the comedic couple who were longtime supporters. The A-list giving continues apace: On June 14, Barbra Streisand held an intimate fund-raiser at her Malibu house in honor of Bill Clinton, with guests including Haim Saban and Ron Meyer and tickets at up to $100,000 a couple. Streisand is working to raise $20 million for the Barbra Streisand Women's Heart Center at the hospital. (She has also contributed $5 million to a separate cardiovascular research and education program named after her there.)
            </p>
            <p>
             ..These days, Cedars -- whose campus is adorned with a 4,000-piece donated art collection that includes works by Picasso, Warhol and Hockney -- vacuums Hollywood dollars from every direction. There's the Sports Spectacular gala each May, which has raised $21 million for the Genetics Institute by getting Fox Sports, CBS, AEG, ESPN and others to shell out at the Century Plaza for a night honoring a David Beckham or a Kobe Bryant. In the fall, the roving Pink Party, run by super-connected Pacific Palisades boutique owner Elyse Walker in support of the women's cancer program, can pull in more than $1 million in an evening from the fashion-oriented film and TV crowd (Jennifer Garner, Kim Raver, E!'s Ashlan Gorse) as well as sponsors like CAA and the Sumner Redstone Foundation.
            </p>
            <p>
             Still, the apex of giving remains the hospital's Women's Guild, which turns 55 this year. Founded by a high-powered clique, including Rosalind Russell, Fran Stark and Nancy Sinatra, the guild now counts Anne Douglas, Morgan Fairchild, Wendy Goldberg and Marcia Ziffren (ex-wife of entertainment lawyer Kenneth Ziffren) among its leaders. The group, which began with the modest intent of raising money for newborns' layettes, has ramped up its goals to funding laser technologies, research chairs and, currently, a $20 million Lung Institute. The guild has paid for it all by heavily leaning on their husbands' pocketbooks and studio-head power, relentlessly working their social circles and throwing what was for decades the industry's undisputed top annual charitable event .
            </p>
            <p>
             Today, the hospital's Hollywood connections are an embarrassment of riches. Who's that doing the voiceover on the in-house video for the new Advanced Health Sciences Pavilion? Oh, just Sidney Poitier. And who is Eskedar Gobeze, a member of the patient relations department, which, when situations allow, can work the insider magic of getting people upgraded to the much-preferred eighth-floor deluxe suites? Why, Gobeze is Berry Gordy's lady friend, of course. (Observes Anne Douglas: "In patient relations, they say you can't go [to the eighth floor] if you're still attached to a machine. You have to be able to breathe on your own!") And the shaved-headed dude yukking it up with Jack Nicholson courtside at a Lakers game? That's his doctor, the head of orthopedic surgery, Robert Klapper -- who, natch, used to consult on E.R.

              apparently he owns a bunch of pizzeria related business... so far all the pizzeria looks legit... there is another address for him registred for Ukiah House Of Pizza, Inc. ... but when following the address on maps, it is just a pub.

              Snagging second place, Homeless: Santa Clara County was developed by non-profit consultant Curtis Chang.  Chang was moved to create the app after watching families approach homeless shelters and seeing case workers struggle to find government services under mountains of paper files. The app helps homeless people and families with services according to their specific needs and eligibility.

            this is going to be a data dump. I have to attend to other things today but I need to post some links here before the connections are lost. Not sure what's going on here but maybe other eyes can look too. I'll create a series of replies to this comment so I don't end up taking up too much space on your thread.

              <p>
               Robert C. Wian (June 15, 1914 – March 31, 1992) was the founder of the Big Boy restaurant chain. The restaurant started as a 10-stool hamburger stand in Glendale, California, opening in 1936 with an investment of $300 raised from the sale of his car. Wian sold Bob's Big Boy and rights to the Big Boy chain to the
               <strong>
                Marriott Corp
               </strong>
               . in 1967 for $7 million[4] ($54 million in 2019).
              </p>
              <p>
               ..After selling Big Boy, Wian remained as a Marriott vice-president and president of the "Big Boy Restaurants of America" division for about a year, then sat on the Marriott board for an additional year before retiring. As a board member, Wian recommended
               <strong>
                Marriott approach his friend Roy Rogers
               </strong>
               about the use of his name to rebrand the corporation's RoBee's Roast Beef chain.

             Okay I've been looking into the history of the national independent concessionaires association inc (NICA) by first looking into the background to the whole concept of fairs (fayres; faires) and then I started looking into the people who started the organisation which is taking me into a whole rabbit hole. So, I'm just posting this bit of history first and then I'll get to the present day rabbit hole.

             <strong>
              A traveling carnival (US English), usually simply called a carnival, or travelling funfair
             </strong>
             is an amusement show that may be made up of amusement rides, food vendors, merchandise vendors, games of chance and skill, thrill acts, and animal acts. A traveling carnival is not set up at a permanent location, like an amusement park or funfair, but is moved from place to place. Its roots are similar to the 19th century circus with both being set up in open fields near or in town and moving to a new location after a period of time. In fact, many carnivals have circuses while others have a clown asthetic in their decor. [1][2] Unlike traditional carnival celebrations, the North American traveling carnival is not tied to a religious observance.
            </p>
            <p>
             In 1893,
             <strong>
              the Chicago's World's Columbian Exposition (also called the Chicago World's Fair) was the catalyst for the development of the traveling carnival.
             </strong>
            </p>
            <p>
             Modern traveling carnivals usually make contracts with local governments in order to play both state and county fairs, as well as smaller venues (such as store parking lots, church bazaars, volunteer fire department fund raisers, and civic celebrations).

            <p>
             Sol Bloom (March 9, 1870 – March 7, 1949) was an Orthodox Jewish[2] American politician from New York who began his career as an entertainment impresario and sheet music publisher in Chicago. He served fourteen terms in the United States House of Representatives from the West Side of Manhattan, from 1923 until his death in 1949...
            </p>
            <p>
             Bloom established his reputation in 1893 at the age of 23 while developing the mile-long Midway Plaisance at the World's Columbian Exposition in Chicago. The Midway Plaisance offered enticing games and exhibitions presented by private vendors, removed from the more conservative Beaux-Arts splendor of the official exposition and arranged around its "Court of Honor". After initially entrusting the midway to a Harvard anthropology professor, the committee turned to Bloom, whose "Midway" was so successful that the term resided henceforth in the American lexicon. At the "Street in Cairo", the North African belly dance was reinvented as the "hootchy-kootchy dance" to a tune made up by Bloom, "The Streets of Cairo, or the Poor Little Country Maid", whose century-old lyrics had traditionally been sung by young boys: "O they don't wear pants/on the sunny side of France"; "There's a place in France/where the women wear no pants"; "...where the naked ladies dance", etc. Bloom did not copyright the tune, which he'd conceived on a piano at the Press Club of Chicago. Bloom also published and promoted “Coon, Coon, Coon”, one of the most famous entries in the coon song genre.

             "Carnival is the oldest festival in the world. Some authors even suggest it originated around 10,000 BC, from the seasonal farming rituals of the ancient peoples. They would greet the return of the spring solstice with singing and dancing. At the festivals to the Egyptian goddess Isis and the bull Apis, and the Teuton goddess Herta, there were already signs of such behaviour.
             <strong>
              These practices were reinforced in the Roman and Greek bacchanalia, saturnalia and lupercalia feasts.

             During the 1893 Chicago World's Fair, a structure that was designed to make the world marvel received its giant axle from Bethlehem Iron. The world's first Ferris wheel needed enough steel to assemble a 140-foot tower to support an all-steel wheel, altogether making a 264-foot (80 m) structure. The iron made in Bethlehem Steel's blast furnaces was responsible for the world's largest single piece of cast iron that had ever been made up to that time.
            </p>
            <p>
             From 1949 to 1952, Bethlehem Steel had a contract with the federal government of the United States to roll uranium fuel rods for nuclear reactors in Bethlehem Steel's Lackawanna, New York, plant. Workers were not aware of the dangers of the heavy metals they were rolling and were not given protective equipment.
            </p>
            <p>
             The company manufactured the steel for many of the country's most prominent landmarks: including: Rockefeller Center, Waldorf Astoria

              Seems SYSCO is NICA INC 's money partner. Could they be linked to Pepsi or
              <strong>
               HEK-293
              </strong>
              ???

               There are no aborted embryonic or fetal cells in any of PepsiCo’s final products.
              </p>
              <p>
               But: Aborted cells are used in the development of artificial flavor enhancers by biotech company Senomyx, with which PepsiCo signed a four-year, $30 million agreement in 2010 for research and development. No Pepsi products containing Senonymx flavor enhancers should be expected until 2013.
              </p>
              <p>
               <strong>
                Senomyx’s disputed cell line is HEK-293, derived from the kidney cells of an aborted baby.
               </strong>
               We could go into the weeds at this point, but Wikipedia offers an easy explanation:
              </p>
              <p>
               Senomyx develops patented flavor enhancers by using “proprietary taste receptor-based assay systems.” These receptors are made from HEK293. HEK stands for Human Embryonic Kidney cells. These cells, which were cloned, originally came from healthy, electively aborted human embryos. Using information from the human genome sequence, Senomyx has identified hundreds of taste receptors and currently owns 113 patents on their discoveries.

              </h1>
              <p>
               Mr. Thomas L. Bené has become well known since his recent appointment as the Chief Executive Officer for the Sysco Corporation. He took the helm on the January first of 2016. He became a member of the Sysco team in April of 2013, and has steadily provided top notch service in leading the company forward.
              </p>
              <ol>
               <li>
                <p>
                 He worked for PepsiCo
                </p>
                <p>
                 Tom Bene had an executive at PepsiCo, Inc. He was the senior vice president of Sales and System Transformation for their operations in North America. He started the position in 2005. By 2009, he became president of the North American Food service company. He had plenty of prior experience before landing the job at Sysco.

                 He spent 23 years working his way up at PepsiCo
                </p>
                <p>
                 When Tom Bené first started his career at PepiCo, it wasn’t at the entry level. He served the company well, and received frequent promotions to more responsible and higher paying jobs within the business. He’s a leader and that’s what he was born to do.

             THIS is the same story with THE FINDERS WAREHOUSE and WEXNER/EPSTEIN associated LLCs! On paper they appeared to be jewelry / wholesale companies but definitely werent in nice retail buildings youd sell a rolex or diamond out of. It would make a great money laundering front (like art) as they deal with small high value items and transactions that are difficult to track or quantify, from all over the world. I'd consider [ jewelry wholesale ] a red flag business when corroborated by other suspicion.

            Also noticed the owners of some of the houses in the area. Elon has 2 house that he just put up for sale, just down the road. One being Gene Wilder's old house...

            Elon Musk Has Quietly Been Buying Up an Entire Cul-de-Sac in Bel-Air for Years

            The Tesla billionaire claims to be cash poor, but he sure is rich in L.A. real estate
           </p>
           <p>
            so joe rogan just posted a new podcast 2 hours ago with elon musk and they are talking about him selling his possessions... they start talking about Gene Wilder’s old house around the 11:00 mark and i think it’s worth checking out... gives me the creeps honestly, especially since i had just read this discovery
           </p>
           <p>
            i actually had just come across it! it made me feel weird listening to him talk about it so i decided to do more digging and came across that. also it’s convenient that if you search “elon musk pedophile” all you get is tons of stories about when he called the diver who rescued kids from the Thai cave a pedo. so i’m not sure if there is nothing to find or if there’s been some censorship. if you don’t want to listen to it all start at about 10/11 mins in. they only talk about it for a couple mins

             <blockquote>
              <p>
               Extraordinary remodel opportunity: Sitting above the Bel Air Golf Course w/ beautiful vistas is this charming ranch house w/ the details and flair of Robert Byrd Design. Open floor plan, flex. use of space; pool, patio, grassy yard and guest cottage. Or build your Dream! Prime Location.
              </p>

               YOUR MAMAS NOTES: We can’t decide, does Gene Wilder’s living room look more like the lounge of a
               <strong>
                “luxury” spa resort
               </strong>
               in Belarus, or the family room of an Appalachian millionaire?
              </p>
              <p>
               According to property records, Mister Wilder, who is surely one of the funniest of the funny men who have ever been pushed out of his mama, purchased this property in 1976 for just $314,000, which was probably a hell of a lot of money back then. The 3 bedroom and 4.5 bathroom ranch style house is dated beyond all sense of style and taste, but children, the location is spectacular.
              </p>
              <p>
               If the first rule of real estate is location, location, location, then this house should sell itself. Located on a bluff overlooking the western finger of the swanky Bel Air Country Club the property is admittedly not on the best part of Chalon Road. But in this neck of the Bel Air woods, that’s just splitting hairs, isn’t it?
              </p>
              <p>
               ...As an aside…anyone who knows Your Mama at all, knows we love candy. All our young life we longed to meet Willy Wonka from the Chocolate Factory so he could guide us into the garden of sweet treats and chocolate rivers.
               <strong>
                We didn’t even care that he was clearly crazy and not just a little pervy.
               </strong>
               It’s truly a wonder we have teeth left in our head and
               <strong>
                it’s prolly even more of a wonder we were never picked up by a crazy eyed stranger in a car offering us a candy bar
               </strong>
               .
               <strong>
                Because children
               </strong>
               , Your Mama was an easy target. At six years old, walking home from elementary school all on our lonesome,
               <strong>
                Your Mama would have done anything for a candy bar.
               </strong>
               An-ee-thing.

              <blockquote>
               <p>
                This home was the last place she was conscious and at peace – On May 17, 1989, in the last stages of ovarian cancer that had metastasized throughout her body, her husband took her in to LA’s Cedars-Sinai for a CAT scan.
               </p>
               <p>
                With amazing precience, somehow Gilda knew if they sedated her for the scan she would never regain consciousness.
               </p>
               <p>
                Gilda started fighting the morphine, and Gene tried to soothe her and tell her it as going to be OK, and she begged him not to let them sedate her and to take her home.
               </p>
               <p>
                Once sedated, her fear came true – she never regained consciousness. Gene Wilder stayed with her at the hospital night and day until she died on May 20, 1989.
               </p>
               <p>
                She never got her request to go back to her ranch house in Bel-Air.
               </p>
               <p>
                I can excuse the man for not redecorating since then. I wouldn’t either.

               What IS going on with Musk. The $$$ homes sound like laundering probably. This, from last year

               He’s everywhere, Trmp’s tweets, Rogan pt 2 thrusting neural link, attention-seeking baby name, movie in space with Tom Cruise....Something very weird is going on. And that whole thing with the Pedo Rescue Guy in Thailand last year. Ends up winning the case. Some kind of message he was trying to send out?
              </p>
              <p>
               At about the 7 min mark in the
               <em>
                first
               </em>
               podcast with Rogan, Rogan tries to probe how Musk got planning permission to start digging/boring tunnels in LA. Musk goes off on some weird ramble, totally sidestepping the question, talking about digging a random pit which then turned into a mile long tunnel, practically overnight. At some point, Eric Garcetti shows up and all but wanders off again. No one (NOT EVEN THE MAYOR!) stopped or questioned him.

                I agree Musk is probably the hottest link in this chain. From my understanding LA had an existing underground infrastructure-rumored to go back to an ancient 'lizard people' city from a 1930's newspaper expose. Take that how you will, but there is a lot

                 As Wonka's boat enters the dark, blood-red tunnel and Gene Wilder starts screaming satanic-sounding poetry ("the danger must be growing / by the fires of hell are glowing / is the grisly reaper mowing?" ) things get more than a little unnerving. The psychedelic soundtrack, heavy with strings and accompanied by jagged, Dali-esque camerawork, is absolutely terrifying.

              I cannot help but wonder if someone in the area isn't trying to "bread crumb" folks into this discovery. No evidence at all for this - just my gut talking.

               Had the same thoughts. I'm not a conspiracy theorist as much as I read alot and heard about the pizza stuff in the news. I literally would have never given it any thought when I seen it, if it wasn't for the press of pizzagate putting it in my radar. Most diving I have ever done was about ancient aliens...

                 Thats possible. I believe today we are witnessing the power of the great awakening. Someone 'awake' had enough awareness to recognize a pattern in their everyday lives from what anons and whistleblowers have compiled and put online over time, and knew that if he presented the information in the right place, there would be others who could help.

            There is one other historical web archive of his YouTube page back in 2016

            . Notice the name change between the two pages (S.G. now and previously Y.T.). This guy is apparently some low level native Israeli actor who moved to LA per
            <a href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm2655206/">

            Any activity there so far? It's also weird the 3 "Nica Inc's" on Google maps are in a straight line from the Griffith area over the hills to the Palisades. I've heard a lot of rumors about the hills of LA having trafficking tunnels in them.
           </p>
           <p>
            Yes this is what I think connects these 3 places. If you look at the map, they line up.
           </p>
           <p>
            Any significant about the other 2 buisness as far as symbolism? Pizza delivery is know but what about chapel (church, obvious pedo connections) and welders (masons)?
           </p>
           <p>
            Yeah that's my thinking...is the "chapel" location used for ritualistic abuse maybe? Masons are a possible connection to the "welder" location. I don't know much about welding but I'll do some research a little later.

             Go through his reviews and pay close attention to his reviews of liquor stores. Idk if I’m paranoid but the way he words those is super fishy, also the liquor stores are located all over the us. Weird.

             I added this number in my contacts and synced my contacts to my Snapchat. “Nica.fried” popped up. I then searched Instagram for Nica.fried and found Nica Friedman. I searched Nica Friedman on twitter and found a teenage girl.

                Cell numbers get recycled fairly frequently. My daughter has a number that used to belong to an NFL football player. For three years, she's gotten people calling for him inviting him to parties etc. If the pizza joint is out of business, odds are good this is what happened.

                We should keep in mind this could have been a set up to get pizzagate researchers to harass a minor.

            Okay, let me bounce this off of you guys. No massive "smoking gun" or anything of the sort - just some oddities. I will throw this out here to catalog it. Maybe it is useful or pertinent later on.
           </p>
           <p>
            - Searching for Nica INC on google earth pulls up all the California (LA area) connections we have discussed. A listing for Nica INC in Brandon, Florida also shows up.
           </p>
           <p>
            - Following this pin takes you to what appears to be some kind of appliance store "Famous Tate"
           </p>
           <p>
            - In the parking lot of this store is another pin that says "Tabernacles of Praise" and is listed as a church. Although, it is not obvious that there is any kind of church here (in the traditional sense)
           </p>
           <p>
            - There is a single review for Tabernacles of Praise stating "Crazy people go here"
           </p>
           <p>
            - This reviewer has made many reviews, mostly of food joints. What I find interesting is that the only review he's attached a photo to is for a now defunct PIZZA place called "Orlando Pizza Delivery". Orlando Pizza Delivery has many reviews. I have not dug deeply into these, but apparently their food was shitty. Might be worth taking a look.
           </p>
           <p>
            - The pin for Nica Inc (that took me to this area to begin with) has a website attached to it.
            <a href="https://www.nicainc.org/">
             https://www.nicainc.org/
            </a>
            for the National Independent Concessionaires Association. I haven't dug into this either. It appears to be some kind of carnival, fair, and festival association (LOL Carnies!). Their logo looked off to me on first glance...not a pedo symbol per se, but still kind of strange [looking] for what they say they do (hands shaking - found at the top of the website).
           </p>
           <p>
            - It's worth noting that there looks to be some building (strip mall, office park?) behind the Famous Tates appliance store. It's possible the church and the carnies have an office back there. Couldn't verify this.
           </p>
           <p>
            If anyone wants to spend some time digging on the
            <a href="https://Nicainc.org">
             Nicainc.org
            </a>
            website,  looking at reviews (and profiles of reviewers) for
            <strong>
             Orlando Pizza Delivery
            </strong>
            , and scoping out what can be found for
            <strong>
             Tabernacles of Praise
            </strong>
            - I think that's worth doing.
           </p>
           <p>
            As I said, take all this for what it's worth...not much at the moment, other than pointing out some oddities.
           </p>
           <p>
            I've done enough Moloch hunting for tonight.
           </p>
           <p>
            Cheers.

             I did research on nicainc.org but could not find anything. Also looked on the names of the executive comite but nothing either. Actually even i google my name i can find more info then those guys. I found it was very strange that it took me nowhere.

            This Sammy may need looking at a bit more - he's left reviews in California, England &amp; Estonia - the one in Estonia is odd and I may be letting my imagination run away with me here....but..

           </p>
           <p>
            A place called Narva Border Market Ou, located on 15, Voidu Prospekt. The google street view definitely doesn't match the front image, which appears to be a bike shop advertising 'Color Kids', even though Sammy praises them for the GPS hardware and garmin collars??!
           </p>
           <p>
            Just a few things seem really odd:
           </p>
           <p>
            I don't really use google street view a lot but I don't remember buildings ever being blurred oiut.
           </p>
           <p>
            The website for Narva Border Market matches the name of the shop in the front image,
            <a href="https://Zarekoj.com">
             Zarekoj.com
            </a>
            , which seems to indicate this is a multi-brand corporation that sells various product lines - as well as GPS, bikes, shoes &amp; dog collars, they also sell coffee, metal detectors and baby carriers (?!).  On their credit report they are also wholsalers of chemical products...
           </p>
           <p>
            I thought maybe the street view was perhaps a glitch but the address listed on the website matches the address of streetview - I honestly can't see a company of this supposed size operating out of an ambandoned block of flats in the corner of Estonia.
           </p>
           <p>
            The person who took the picture used at the front, showing the bike shop, is  one Sergey Gridin who reviewed the place in Russian, translated as : "On sale baby strollers, car seats. An excellent selection of metal detectors at surprisingly low prices. For buyers from Russia - everything is 1/6 cheaper due to tax refund. Search for goods in Europe for the customer"
           </p>
           <p>
            What is it with metal detectors?
           </p>
           <p>
            He like Sammy has been around a bit and offered a fair few reviews around Europe. Like this one, for 'Varialift Airships PLC', a property management company (?!) which, like your Nica pizzeria is just a house in a suburb, but in England. "I`d like to be a passenger  in  first flight!"

             I used to live in VA beach and was doing some unrelated research, stumbled on a similar pattern close to centerville turnpike. A bunch of fake looking businesses in nice looking neighborhoods.
            </p>
            <p>
             Not sure how to link but look up Navajo bazaar and Undercover bling on google maps. They're on opposite sides of the street and both in culdesacs. Some other ones scattered around the same area too.
            </p>
            <p>
             Also worth mentioning, there's a greek pizza place that used to be in the same area that's now closed down. Their website is now incest porn. Idk if related or if any of this is anything just thought it was all odd.

            I would love to find more info on any tunnels in Bel Air, Hollywood Hills or the palisades. Trying think this is something to connect. Look at the placement of these 3 Nica inc houses... maybe a stretch but what about any kinda star alignment or planetary alignment. If anyone has been to the Griffith observatory(same area) or read about it, its has astrological significance...

              A good trick of the trade is to add the number as a contact in your phone. Then go to a social media app like Instagram or twitter for example and sync contacts to the app and see if the number has an account that pops up

            I feel like we're building up to a big reveal. It really seems like it. People are waking up left and right and some really big names are starting to speak up.
           </p>
           <p>
            Side note, there is a kids camp down on the beach, that almost follows that line directly. The site has a locked members area only behind it. In the registration section There is a recommendation option called "peach head". I'm not sure what to think of that, and I can't find anything else on it. It seems highly out of place though

Nicholson,” “Mr. W. Beatty,” “Mr. K. Douglas” and “Mr. J. Caan” during the late 1970s and 80s"

              Yes, I read the above article and looked at this picture and some of the other comments. I did not read them all as there is a lot to digest. This screenshot has been archived but I don't know what to make of the phone conversation.

              Other than it not being very professional, I don't see any smoking gun. The person texted vague questions and got vague answers. If I'm not understanding the importance of these texts please let me know.

             Maybe that older couple has nothing to do with it, and the address itself is code for another location. If it were the real location, that would be too easy; I am starting to think. I don't foresee people of that age using the internet to ping secret info. I think we need to dig deeper and leave the older adults alone, but we aware that this address is something; it just might not be this exact place.  Let's further check the Homeowners of the other locations too.

               Possible. I only know when I hear the age of of 90 and 94 I think of my own grandparents who are although pretty good with internet, are out of the loop with this kind of lifestyle. Then again I shouldn't assume.

            Here from Reddit research too. Finally became a user. Thanks for this post. Supposed underground bunker and tunnels under the Getty Museum as well which is near by, closer than the playboy mansion if I am not mistaken.

             EXACTLY. How many other iconic LA sites within a 3 mile radius have underground tunnels? Getty Center, UCLA, Playboy Mansion, ManDEVILle Canyon ... This is the same area of the recent weird fires too.

In the app, you'll be able to see the time you should check in by, view your place in line, share your place in line or leave the waitlist“

              Also there are mismatched orange traffic cones out in the driveway, discouraging cars to park out in front of the garage. People must be trying to park there often enough to warrant some cones.
