            The UN and the Solvay drug family castle in Belgium had all kinds of rituals and kids, hunting parties, MK Ultra and the altar in the backyard with 1000 points of lights. However, google has scrubbed a lot of the Solvay castle off the internet. The Mothers of Darkness castle.

             Closely tied to Solvay are Abbott who purchased the company years ago, and SC Johnson who is a major player in elite global corruption. The "root" of all Evil is in Racine, Wisconsin which behind the real agenda of global enslavement and the Mark of the Beast.
            </p>
            <p>
             One of the key elements they are pushing now is mental health, also tied to global education reform. Racine, Wisconsin is where these programs and models are all developed.

               SC Johnson is based in Racine, Wisconsin, but Johnson &amp; Johnson is also involved and connected to the same groups.
              </p>
              <p>
               They are using mental health as the new way to identify, segment, push drugs, and control people and families. They want everyone diagnosed with something. They want everyone to have an excuse and be a victim, which in turn will be the way to maintain control over resources and benefits. Through mental health education and drugs they can use new programming methods to control groups of the population, and leverage against families. They want to kill the family unit and family values in place of community and community values. They want to separate children from their parents and grandparents. They are rebuilding comprehensive mental health programs, community policing programs (including how law enforcement addresses mental health issues), and global education programs to control not only the narrative of our history, but also of our present and future. A main goal is to use science and AI to eliminate faith, individualism and creativity, turning the world into atheism and agnosticism.
              </p>
              <p>
               One prime example is how they are remolding and reforming education through public-private partnerships as they are using Racine as a model for with Amazon, Foxconn, SC Johnson and others involved. They are building a slave race and pipeline of control from "cradle to grave". Another related initiative is called Resilient Communities, tied to Sustainability and Sanctuary city programs that all lead to global enslavment and the Mark of the Beast.

                Oh, I get it/had not heard of RC.  All staged events have multiple purposes.  Ppl think it's about gun control but gun sales always go up after a ff.  Gun dealers etc make a fortune.  Those events just usher in more govt surveillance basically and of course the mental health issue.
               </p>
               <p>
                So sure, all these so called 'natural' disasters would be the framework to usher in resilient communities.  And yes, they also serve as distractions, generating fear (which feeds the matrix) and all the other trailers but what better way to get ppl on board of RC than to have disasters everywhere and incompetent gov response either local, state or fed...or all 3.

                 Correct, with a new corrupt Foxconn development in progress signed off by Trump himself in a corporate extortion deal with a truly nefarious plan that will be over 20 times the aize of the Amazon plant.

                 SC Johnson controls the area through the Rothschild and Rockefeller chain of command and a range of partners such as Abbott (and Solvay), Case, Wheaton Franciscan, Cargill, Bayer, Mnsanto, Dow, DuPont, Google, Facebook, Nestle, Dept. of Defense, CFR, DNC, RNC, Dominican Sisters, various factions of the mafia, and the Vatican. Secret societies and global groups involved all link back to Racine, Wisconsin. The feds know all about it and it went all the way up to Comey and Lynch directly. That is why they were replaced.
                </p>
                <p>
                 Racine, Wisconsin is the model and "Root" to the real agenda and the Truth.

               Yes, Solvay"s pharma unit was sold for $7 Billion to Abbott (bssed near Racine) and both Solvay and Abbott are close partners of SC Johnson (who also owns many other businesses including purchssing the insecticides unit from Bayer among many other deals). They also share control over the Carolinas, with strong links in New York, DC, Hollywood, Florida, Pennsylvania, Arizona, Colorado, and in many hubs known for trafficking and abuse with key links to Belgium, Netherlands, Haiti, Brazil, Ghana, Pakistan, UAE, India, etc.
              </p>

               Of note regarding the Solvay acquisition is:

               Racine is of course a main hub and model for viruses and vaccines such as Zika with SC Johnson and the Rockefeller patent, and Rotary International and Clinton Global Health Initiative.

             Well after reading the NYT article about  him and especially him having lunch with David Copperfield, who we have seen possible proof of him being a pedophile, I was pretty convinced this guy is a Bad Actor.   But his creation of the Artificial Intelligence  (AI) Org. seals it up for me.  Many times have we read the reports of

              Trump is a Mason as well, and has done nothing to expose the real Truth or drain the real swamp that is filled with his friends and colleagues.
             </p>
             <p>
              The U.N. is the one world government that is behind the true global agenda, and is closely tied to Racine, Wisconsin under the great deception of Sustainability enforced by AI and Community Policing. Many subgroups help to support this structure, most notably the Council on Foreign Relations and Chicago Council on Global Affairs. These are the formal arms of Pilgrims Society, Committee of 300 and other secret societies involved. Art in Embassies also began with corporations based in Racine and has led to a system of trafficking both in the shadows and in the open. They flaunt it and control the ports, airports and corrupt law enforcement.
             </p>
             <p>
              There is likely more to the relationship between Paolo Zampolli, Melania and Trump. It is alleged that Melania worked for Paolo as part of a modeling agency, real estate firm and elite escort service.
             </p>
             <p>
              If Trump is ready to prove he is going to drain the swamp he can start with his Litmus Test in Racine and Wisconsin. Instead of exposing the Root of Evil and corruption in Paul Ryan's district, he recently signed off on a corrupt Foxconn deal that has sold America out to corporate extortion. Wisconsin is also where Melania made her political debut.
             </p>
             <p>
              "Though she had appeared wordlessly behind her husband on plenty of stages throughout the long, weird winter of Trump’s primary march, Melania’s debut as a campaigner came on a snowy April night in Wisconsin."

                 Would love to chat about "sustainability" at some point, as I genuinely don't understand the correlation you're making there beyond that of worldfuckers capitalizing on the whole thing.

                <p>
                 I for one, personally, care a great deal about the past, present and future(evidenced by my willingness to look into the darkness that 'civilization' is built upon) - it is my understanding that there is many things we can do to improve how we interact with our planet and it's environment... in one way or another, balance is required between renewables-based-energy and fossil-fuel-based-energy - that we can very much offset some of the damage we cause as a species, by reforming a few industries such as the logging and mining industries.
                </p>
                <p>
                 I certainly see a few ways in which an initiative like this, can be manipulated to favor those who actually want to see things get worse for everyone else bar themselves, but, I also see some real benefits to making a real effort to be conscientious of our effects on the environment as a species.

                 I have to disagree there only on the basis that we're all in this together, even the common man/woman IS part of the system and that's why it's on us to fix it... whatever that may entail.

               Thank you for cementing what I have suspected, although with great disappointment.  I suspected there was truth to the story and accusations regarding Paolo and Melania and the Escort Service.   Exposing the UN is of great importance.  The death of John Ashe still has not been solved and I believe played a very important part in some of this.  Fox Conn was the writing on the wall for me.  I lost all hope in him.  Also now with Amazon as well coming into play.  Mark of the Beast.

                  Yeah, I have to look at the AI issue in depth.  At this point I'm thinking could AI be any worse than the so called intelligence floating around these days...jk you understand but omg vegas now omg HW and another omg tomorrow.  I saw one thread on reddit spiracy listing the good guys in bollywood...Depp was on the list and few others that made me go are you f***ing serious?

                   Yeah, well they are trying to save who they can in hopes the whole ship does not go down.  I just posted that I believe they are trotting some of the Top Starlets to make it appear that  Hot &amp; Heavy Harvey does not like little children.  The are hoping it all Blows Over before the Whole Thing Blows Up.

                    Oh, excellent point!!!  Friend of mine is livid, writes daily going so many of these so called starlets are really trannies.  I'm not sure how many but she opened my eyes to something that had totally escaped me...that the god they worship, what the heck is his name, is man, woman and beast.  I had not really spent much time thinking about Bahomet (had to look it up) but when I let it sink in, sure...all the tranny stuff.  Mind you I have a good friend that is a tranny and she is nothing like these um, in your face have to use this bathroom thing and thinks society is going down the tubes with so much focus on sex.  It would stand to reason all the estrogen etc in food, water to muddy the waters and cause some real sexual identity issues to the point ppl start cutting off parts of their bodies (my friend does not intend to do so).  She was telling me how some have their face peeled back to change the shape of the skull/again nothing she is even remotely interested in.

                     I have such compassion for people that don't feel right in their bodies.  Whatever the reason, born that way, or damaged by what is in the food  air, ground, it does not matter.  But they that force children into accepting an opposite sex, they are evil.  Yes, let's hope that the lid blows off and a whole slew of people formerly abused when children, let's hope they sing like canaries.  Your friend sounds like a wonderful person.  Bless Her.

                      She really is carmencita.  She has been in a loving and supportive relationship for 8 years with a woman who supports her transition which started a year ago.  I'm so thankful for that bc so many trannies dealing with all they have to deal with (can't even imagine) wind up taking themselves out.  And these are the very ppl that are being victimized by the cannibal satanic cabal.  Saw one news clip where an all girls school in Au has now forbidden the staff to refer to them as girls, ladies etc.  It is deff part of the agenda.  Target announcing you can go into any bathroom you chose?  Wonder who the owners of Target are and who are they connected to?  Do they know anyone in Racine...inquiring minds.

                       I think a large problem about all of this is because we do not have enough mental health help.  Reagan closed them all down one by one.  Imagine all those with questions of whether or not to go through the medical changes and finding no answers.  I dream of one day that we open them back up.  So many problems will be solved for Veterans, and others.  Well,  one can dream. Yes, Target I believe is marching in lockstep with those that do no wish us well.

            I have an answer for you but you may not like it if you're into partisan politics.
           </p>
           <p>
            I strongly advise you to look into
            <strong>
             Ambassador Paolo Zampolli
            </strong>
            .  Many people won't because he is the man who introduced Trump to Melania.  But spend a few minutes looking into him and you will see that something is seriously amiss that a man like this has so much influence at the UN.  You will also be struck by the role his young son seems to play in his business.
           </p>
           <p>
            Here's his personal website:

           <p>
            First, here's some background on him :
            <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/v/pizzagateTNT/1980683">
