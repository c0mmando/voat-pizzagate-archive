<p>LUIS TRYBOM: ACCORDING TO KATU.COM, PORTLAND YOUTH SOCCER TRAINER FACING SEX ABUSE AND CHILD PORNOGRAPHY CHARGES WAS ALREADY A REGISTERED SEX OFFENDER — 7/08/2017</p>
<p>Portland, OR — How well do you know your roommate?</p>
<p>A woman, who police say found disturbing evidence in a sex abuse and child pornography case, told KATU she had no idea her former roommate was a registered sex offender.</p>
<p>The suspect, Luis Trybom, 38, is also a local youth soccer trainer. KATU broke the story of his arrest last Wednesday. At that time he faced just four charges. Now, Trybom is charged with 21 crimes including four counts of third-degree sex abuse, 10 counts of child pornography (encouraging child sex abuse in the first degree), luring a minor, failure to report as a sex offender and four counts of using a child in a display of sexually explicit conduct, a Class A felony. In court documents, Portland police say Trybom took nude and explicit photos of a 17-year-old girl after she allegedly told him she was uncomfortable with the process. The documents also say Trybom touched the girl to &quot;adjust&quot; her clothing and that text messages show she told him her age. Officers also say Trybom asked the girl to send him photos displaying her chest, cleavage and backside and used coded language to ask her to be a sex slave.</p>
<p>&quot;He is a scary man and he deserves to be in jail forever,&quot; said a woman KATU is calling &quot;Chelsea,&quot; who didn\'t want to publicly reveal her real name.</p>
<p>Police say Chelsea found several photos of the girl on a thumb drive in a home she shared with Trybom on Northeast Schuyler Street.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&quot;They were just lewd and pornographic and a horrific thing to find,&quot; Chelsea explained.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>She said she made the discovery after police came to the house in October and she later learned Trybom was a sex offender. She said she packed up her things in the kitchen and accidentally took the thumb drive from a junk drawer.</p>
<p>&quot;I moved in with him in January of last year,&quot; said Chelsea, explaining that she\'d met Trybom through Craigslist before moving to Portland from San Francisco. &quot;He seemed great. He\'s really personable. He can turn on the charm. … He worked with children. I was really impressed with that. He had all of these great accolades when he told me about himself. Of course, I googled him. I didn\'t find anything negative at that time.&quot;</p>
<p>Chelsea also said she checked the state\'s public sex offender registry before moving in and Trybom wasn\'t on it.</p>
<p>As KATU has reported, due to complex legal requirements, Oregon currently only publicly lists about 2 percent of the state\'s nearly 29,000 sex offenders, far below neighboring states. &quot;I feel pretty angry,&quot; said Chelsea. &quot;I feel like the system is supposed to be set up to protect us and make us feel safe and because of paperwork or sex offenders\' rights we aren\'t protected.&quot; Chelsea said she learned about Trybom\'s status as a sex offender when she called Oregon State Police in October after Portland officers showed up at her home. There\'s no word if Trybom\'s charges are linked to his work as director of the Portland Soccer Academy, a youth training organization. </p>
<p>Photos on the group\'s Facebook page show Trybom training several teenage girls. On Linkedin he claims to have founded the group in 2008. &quot;What\'s scarier is that he can be so personable and so charming,&quot; Chelsea said. &quot;And he\'s literally like living next to the devil. He is a scary man.&quot; Police say they were tipped off to the case by a school social worker who the girl confided in, and that they were investigating her claims when Chelsea gave them the thumb drive.</p>
<p>KATU found out the government does not require private youth sports leagues or groups like Trybom\'s to run criminal background checks on staff members in Oregon. Trybom was previously convicted of third-degree sex abuse in 1997.</p>

<p>As far as I know, in Portland the Shanghai Tunnels are still operating. On the tunnel route is this 19th century church with this <a href="https://kek.gg/i/5JT89V.jpeg">pic</a> on the door. Coincidentally sleeping/passed out in front was a homeless <a href="https://kek.gg/i/3f_dBX.jpeg">20-something</a> wearing a jersey from the <a href="https://kek.gg/i/5b3wk8.jpeg">Portland Soccer Academy boy\'s team</a>. Fortunately I had stopped believing in coincidence long before that moment.</p>
<p>The city doesn\'t have a subway system, and hasn\'t wanted a subway system despite putting in streetcars and literail. A proper subway system would eliminate 90% of the traffic issues in downtown Portland. I\'m willing to bet that the city council is in on whatever shit is happening, just like the D\'angelos in Vancouver.</p>
<p>I was investigating the reason why culture of the region shifted so suddenly after the 00s. Before my research, I thought it was the Commiefornia migration through I-5. The migration accounts for the shit drivers but it doesn\'t account for the increased antifa presence.</p>
<p>Then I found this: <a href="https://archive.fo/swyUY">https://archive.fo/swyUY</a></p>
<p>The Jewish population doubled shortly after things turned to shit. </p>
<p>Another interesting tid-bit is that there are gangs of homeless kids that roam around downtown at night, many flock to Voodoo Doughnuts. Pioneer Courthouse Square also tends to have a lot of teenage hoodlums.</p>',

            Pittsburgh has been getting more strange to due to the Khazars spreading more out instead of staying in their neighborhood in the actual city. A lot of Russian mafia here too since the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991. Many of them are Khazars. Before the Russians, it was the Italians but the ones who were at the top were "Jewish" wholly or partially.

            Thanks for bringing up the shanghai tunnels. I used to have a great site on that and now the search results are dumbing down the entire subject.  Not only could some of the old ones still be in use, new ones could be being dug as we type. I knew a captain who had a hard time getting off a Chinese fishing boat in Mexico. They needed him because of rules for docking even with a flag of convenience. They would break all international rules catching the sharks in the Gulf of Mexico, dump the sharks and can the the fins in the Yucatan. He said that if he was not 60 and a captain he would have been a slave or killed for fun

            Portland, Oregon was known as the absolute vice mecca of the west coast as recently as the 1950's (Sammy Davis got his start there...)

              Thats why women are such abject disasters when left to make their own decisions.   Emotionally react to truths,  can't think logically.   You truly are lesser beings who were much happier being literal property of men.
