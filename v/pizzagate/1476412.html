            A very difficult situation.
It is said that going public usually is a good life-insurance.
But before doing so, one must have waterproove evidence.
So I would suggest that he secures the evidence he has.
           </p>
           <p>
            I would not recommend to contact Wikileaks, as long as Assange has not been seen alive again. It could be that Wikileaks is compromised, despite Assange's latest 19-page letter without his signature.
           </p>
           <p>
            I would do the following:
I would research in my state, where pedophile investigations successfully took place and who worked on them to uncover them. Then I would look for the people who were working on it. Not to high in the hierarchy. Then I would contact one person and tell him about a friend who has infos and listen to what he suggests (give no details and names; maybe even use false info, to lead away from the person with the info).
           </p>
           <p>
            I thionk it is important to only trust people, who have a public record, that they wanted to uncover such things. People who suffered severe consequences because of their investigations, could also be good sources to learn about trustworthy contacts.
           </p>
           <p>
            For example, if I were Belgian or French, I would find out relatives of murdered police officers.
Or in the UK, I would try to establsih a contact to investigators of Jimmy Savile 8not to high in the rank, because we don't know, how much in that case was covered up).

             I would not trust wikileaks ever but especially right now.  Most likely scenario is they don't publish and you get v8. I would publish myself publicly on many places.  put info graphics and evidence on 100 usb sticks and mail them to multiple police departments, multiple journalists, alternative news sources, many child protection companies and organisation's.  Maybe have 2 different packages,  LE containing graphic evidence and one for public consumption with only censored images. flood the information everywhere then hide out. sounds like he could afford taking a month or 2 off work and wouldn't have trouble getting other employment
            </p>
            <p>
             edit: I would include a pgp signed message with the info dump so you could prove being the whistle blower if necessary
