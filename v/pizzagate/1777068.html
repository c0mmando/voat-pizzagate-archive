            There would be no NCMEC without the crypto Jew John Walsh.

           <p>
            Has anyone looked into Walsh's claims that his son ADAM was abducted?

             Yes. The detective in charge of the case told me that Walsh had "never been cleared of complicity in the disappearance of his son." That detective was subsequently replaced with one who was less chatty. That was a cult case: The Hand of Death. I interviewed the Killer.
