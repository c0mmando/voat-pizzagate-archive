<blockquote>
<p>At this point you should be well aware that in the final installments of the \'Twilight\' saga Taylor Lautner\'s character Jacob falls in love -- or &quot;imprints&quot; in \'Twilight\' terminology -- on Bella and Edward\'s baby girl. Creepy, right? Lautner doesn\'t seem to think so.</p>
<p>If you aren\'t familiar with the books, &quot;imprinting&quot; is something that happens when a werewolf finds their soulmate, and things get all twinkly and magical and their soul is bonded to the other person (or werewolf... or vampire... or wood nymph... or whatever) forever. Jacob - who spent four movies so far pining for Bella - &quot;imprints&quot; himself on her baby daughter, Renesmee.</p>
<p>In an interview with EW, Lautner says he found this idea unsettling at first, but then he spoke with \'Twilight\' author Stephenie Meyer and understood that it wasn\'t as simple as, like, a grown man creepily falling in love with a child (or as we normies like to call it, &quot;pedophilia&quot; -- gross). Says Lautner:</p>
<p>&quot;Everybody likes to tease me about it. Everyone thinks it’s so funny, and I laugh along with them, but it’s important for me to keep in my mind that it’s as simple as a lifelong bond. It’s not nearly as creepy as everybody likes to joke.&quot;</p>
<p>You\'re right, Tay-Tay! Falling in love with a kid is totally not creepy as long as you\'re a werewolf in poorly written fantasy fiction! This makes it totally okay! Even co-star Robert Pattinson thinks it\'s weird saying, &quot;The first scene I saw them together, I literally could not stop laughing. I wouldn’t have been able to do it.&quot;</p>
<p>The next time a neighborhood pedo knocks on our door to announce his presence in the neighborhood, we\'ll just tell him to pretend he\'s a werewolf and no one will care.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Now I readily admit I know very little about the Twilight lore, but I have come across the psychological concept of &quot;imprinting&quot;</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imprinting_(psychology)">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imprinting_(psychology)</a></p>
<p>Imprinting can be understood in context of Pavlov\'s dogs. Animals and humans can be conditioned to physically respond to various stimuli (regardless if said stimuli -&gt; reaction is beneficial). Usually imprinting occurs in the formative/developmental stages of life, with repetition, and/or during significant/traumatic events. In Pavlov\'s dog\'s, a ringing bell prefaced a meal. Thus, the dogs salivated whenever a bell was rung.</p>
<p>A famous fictional example is the Ludovico Technique in A Clockwork Orange: <a href="https://jaysanalysis.com/2017/03/03/a-clockwork-orange-mk-ultra-jay-dyers-analysis/">https://jaysanalysis.com/2017/03/03/a-clockwork-orange-mk-ultra-jay-dyers-analysis/</a> (interestingly, this example specifically involves sexual molestation/imprinting)</p>
<p>Unsurprisingly, the history of child &quot;imprinting&quot; goes back to the Tavistock Institute: </p>

<blockquote>
<p>The core issues are issues that concern the basic survival of the mind. Therapists have blamed victims for not cooperating in integrating the core, when a fuller understanding of the dynamics of programming shows that the victim is only attempting to protect himself. In 1960, J.D. Sutherland at the second Tavistock seminar on mother-infant interaction in London presented his work which was entitled &quot;The concepts of imprinting and critical period from a psycho-analytic viewpoint.&quot; This was reprinted in a book Determinants of Infant Behavior II. Sutherland discovered that traumatic frustration experiences in a child’s early development set up subsystems in a person, which continue to seek expression, and are relatively little influenced by subsequent experiences. The formation of social relationships by an infant relates to the concept of imprinting. Researchers have not sorted out all the complex processes, but imprinting researchers feel confident that imprinting in humans has some parallels to precocial birds. They found that newborn babies less than a day old will follow a real face much more than a mannequin. This proved for instance that babies are programmed prior to birth to respond to human faces. There are obviously some built-in mechanisms to human thinking. The human brain is actually 7 brains. The lower three brains are: one, the medulla; two, the pons; and three, the cerebellum. On top of the pons, is the fourth brain, the mid-brain. The mid-brain is the central brain linking the 3 higher and the 3 lower brains. It relays messages back and forth. It regulates the life force, and serves as a regulator to states of consciousness. Secretions in the fourth brain create the emotional construct of &quot;me’. If traumatized, such as during the splitting-the-core trauma, the mid-brain does not secrete the peptides or endorphines which relate to the self-sense that is attached to a sensory experience. In other words, when the core is split, the mid-brain ceases to secrete the peptides that emotionally connect its potential sense of self to the sensations of the body. The mid-brain is also the area that is imprinted with roles. Each one of the 7 brains that make up the entire structure called the human brain is capable of having feelings. This is one reason why we can have &quot;mixed feelings&quot; about one item. What seems to occur during the splitting of the core (referred to as the Primal Dissociate Experience PDE), is that the mind decides that survival is dependent upon not identifying with what is happening. In a sense it decides that death to the self is a type of survival. The mind creates dissociated &quot;ego states&quot; (what Sutherland called &quot;subsystems&quot;) to deal with these difficult situations that it refuses to accept into its memory as happening to itself. Deep level ISH (internal self-helpers--perhaps Guardian angels) have been successfully used to reintegrate the PDE held in that special part of the mind back into the mind.</p>

            You have an interesting point. This is definitely a mnemonic que. A peripheral element that doesn't make sense to those not in the know and not cognitively realized by others until it clicks in the future. Pre-programming pedophilia.

              An epic statement   The sucking of the blood is a euphemism for sex. I missed it too but the ads were enough for me.  There were always many vampires in the old movies sucking blood out of very young girls/women. It always seemed sexual to me.

            Lautner was one of Singer's boys for years.  He's probably too old for Singer now.  Lautner may now be moving from victim to predator.

            Very interesting info. I consider the Whale to be reliable info. The Tavistock research sounds motivated by MK-ultra programming:
           </p>
           <p>
            "If traumatized, such as during the splitting-the-core trauma, the mid-brain does not secrete the peptides or endorphines which relate to the self-sense that is attached to a sensory experience. In other words, when the core is split, the mid-brain ceases to secrete the peptides that emotionally connect its potential sense of self to the sensations of the body. The mid-brain is also the area that is imprinted with roles."
           </p>
           <p>
            An infant "imprinting" would be beneficial in the natural course of things; the repeated presence of the mother caring for the baby would create a healthy life-sustaining bond.  The Twilight author corrupts this meaning by substituting a "sexual suitor" instead of a nurturing parent. This defines a pedo. The script itself corrupts the actor portraying this unnatural "imprinting" and also corrupts the thinking of those watching the film.
THIS IS BY DESIGN.

             yep the mormon writer that worships a prophet who was a known pedophile, thus tarred, feathered, had nitric acid poured in his mouth and was finally murdered by a mob after being run out of town after town.
