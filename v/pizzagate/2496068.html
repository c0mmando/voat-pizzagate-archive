<p>Authorities in Northern California are searching for a family whose vehicle matches the description of an SUV that witnesses say was swept away by a river in Mendocino County.</p>
<p>The family of four disappeared last week in the same region where another family died after apparently driving off a cliff last month.</p>
<p>A poster shared by friends and relatives on social media says that Sandeep Thottapilly, his wife, Soumya, and their two children were on a road trip and were last heard from Thursday. They were supposed to meet with family in San Jose on Friday, but they never showed up, according to the San Jose Police Department.</p>
<p>The poster also identifies the couple’s children as Siddhant Thottapilly, 12, and Saachi Thottapilly, 9. They were traveling from Portland, Ore., to their home in Santa Clarita, Calif., just outside Los Angeles.</p>
<p>The family’s vehicle was a maroon or burgundy 2016 Honda Pilot. The California Highway Patrol told the Los Angeles Times that witnesses saw a newer-model, maroon Honda Pilot falling off a steep embankment into the Eel River off U.S. Route 101 near Leggett, a small camping and hiking destination in the county. The vehicle was traveling south on the highway, which runs parallel to the river.</p>
<p>A CHP spokesman was not available Wednesday morning, but Officer William Wunderlich told the Times that small plastic pieces believed to have come from the vehicle were found at the scene. Search efforts, however, were hampered by heavy rainfall last week. The rain caused the river to swell and to be clouded with mud and debris, Wunderlich said.</p>
<p>Lt. Shannon Barney, of the Mendocino County Sheriff’s Office told the Press-Democrat of Santa Rosa Tuesday that responders will begin searching the south fork of the river once water levels drop and the river flow slows.</p>
<p>Authorities said they have not determined that the vehicle belonged to the missing family, whose SUV had the California license plate 7MMX138. Absent a license plate and a serial number for the vehicle that witnesses saw, investigators don’t want to “jump to conclusions,” Wunderlich told the Times.</p>
<p>The nearly 200-mile Eel River snakes across Mendocino County and Humboldt County to the north.</p>
<p>The incident happened roughly 30 miles from the area where another family’s SUV plunged 100 feet down a cliff off the scenic Pacific Coast Highway and into the ocean. The crash killed a married couple, Jennifer Jean Hart and Sarah Margaret Hart, both 38, and at least three of their six children. The other three are feared to be dead. Investigators said that vehicle may have been intentionally driven off the cliff.</p>

<p>The family, Sandeep Thottapilly, 42; Soumya Thottapilly, 38; Siddhant Thottapilly; 12; and Saachi Thottapilly, 9, have been missing since April 5.</p>
<p>The family, which reportedly checked out of the Holiday Inn Express hotel in Klamath, Ore., April 6, was heading to San Jose to spend an evening with Sandeep Thottapilly\'s cousin but didn\'t show up.</p>
<p>A CBSLA report from Valencia said April 10 that authorities in San Jose, who are handling the case, are investigating whether an SUV that had been swept away into a river in Mendocino County during heavy rains was carrying the family.</p>
<p>A California Highway Patrol spokesperson told the Santa Clarita Valley Signal April 11 that an SUV matching the description of the Pilot may have been swept into the Eel River off Highway 101 north of the town of Leggett.</p>
<p>“The vehicle was completely submerged in the river due to the heavy rain,” CHP Officer William Wunderlich told The Signal. “We are working on finding the vehicle but we are not able to locate it.”</p>
<p>Sandeep Thottapilly is vice president of Union Bank in Santa Clarita. Saachi attends Meadows Elementary School in Santa Clarita and Siddhant graduated from Meadows last year.</p>
<p>Anyone with information about the family, driving a maroon Honda Pilot with California plate No. 7MMX138, is urged to call local authorities or (813) 616-3091.</p>

            , I'm going to give this the 24 Hour flair. Your title is inaccurate, 30 miles is LONG way away. They weren't even on the same highway, but you imply they went off the same road in the same location.

             It is in the same area.  That's what the Title says.  I copied the title almost exactly the same.  I shortened it by one or two words.   It's not far from there.  I think it is a little odd that the same type of accident happens so close to that cliff.  There is something very strange going on there.  Constant excuses for not being able to hunt for those children.  Missing Bankers Galore.  It's a shame people will not be able to weight in. There is more to this.  Those with EYES can see.

             <p>
              Your title says "Vehicle vanishes where Hart family plunged off cliff". The "one or two words" you shortened it by completely changes the meaning. You wrote a clickbait headline that spins the truth, just like the MSM. We don't do that here. It completely trashes our credibility if we allow that.

                Not trying to insult you, carm. Just trying to keep us from sliding down the slippery slope of inaccuracy. Free speech is important because words have power and meaning. If you write something other than what you mean, it's important to take responsibility and correct it.

             There's more than one Fort Bragg.
            </p>
            <p>
             Fort Bragg, NC is a military installation.
            </p>
            <p>
             Fort Bragg, CA is a tourist destination. It was a Garrison during the civil war, but not a fortification and there's no military there (that I am aware of; been there several times)... So I would double check any links between Mil and Fort Bragg CA, and making sure that you don't mean North Carolina instead.

              I checked the article I posted and it is very odd that it nowhere mentions which one it is.  So, since you are familiar with it I will take your word for it.  It came up when I typed in Fort Bragg CA.  But we know the internet........ I will delete part of it.  Thank you.

               Fort Bragg ca is a small town (actually one of the larger towns in the area) in Mendocino county. It's beautiful and right on the coast. Lots of bed and breakfasts, cute shops, and quaint restaurants. It's name is misleading because it's not a military base.

                It used to be a military base in the 1800s.  Someone confided in me that there is MK Ultra and that Mendocino is a controlled area.  The Sheriffs being compromised is telling.  Officer Allman is Freemason and also a coroner and can do what he wants.  He was in a Sex Swap Ring with Sheriff Barney.  They can tell us whatever they want.  They can tell us they are all dead when they could have all been trafficked.  The women, who knows where they are.  They were home schooled and starved and abused and controlled just like the Turpin children.  Imo, this reeks and that is why I think the new crash is suspect, because of those 2 Officers.  They are highly suspect, so I cannot believe them.

             Somehow I don't think it is that simple.  Let's research a little further.  Those LE Officers are compromised and really should not be trusted. After I found out about the Sex Ring, I just don't find them believable.

              hey moron, sometimes people just crash their cars in a flood. in fact it happens all of the time. they should not have been driving on that road - there were numerous issues in the area from extremely heavy rain and flooding - it's full of mountains so the rain all collects and pushes river levels really high. there's some kind of interesting universal call-back here, but I believe that serves only to highlight the utter horribleness of the initial event, contrasting it with a genuine accident. it's likely because our response as a culture was too muted to the crazy jew dykes murdering their black adoptees.

               Those are the good guys right?  I have it from someone else that there are some covert operations going on there.  Can't tell who cause there is something that was told in confidence.  So that is why I am focusing on it.  What do you know about it?

            Also this happened 30 miles away.   Is that still coincidence?   what if it was 50 miles or a 100 miles ?  When does it stop being related?

             We will never really know, because the Sheriff Barney and Allman were involved in a Sex Swap Ring.  And Allman is the coroner.  Hmm.  Nothing to see here folks...........  Yes, it is possible that there is some real fishy stuff going on in Mendocino and Fort Bragg.

               I am kind of sick of the term Conspiracy Theory. Bankers jump out of high rise buildings often because it a high stress job. They get hired for the math skills and get dead for their humanity and no backup plan. Easy to die in the pool. Anyone can drown.

                Geert Tack worked as a private banker for ING and managed portfolios of wealthy clients. The Belgian had a lot of respect in the financial world and was known as an up and top professional. His sudden disappearance was also smashed like a bomb. "If Tack himself was having trouble he has managed to keep it well hidden", say colleagues.  SMASHED LIKE A BOMB.

                  The 'court ruling' was to document that the Corporate Office of Union Bank was fully aware of their involvement in Felony Municipal Bond Fraud and Embezzlement. Emails sent to Union Bank Employees is simply an FYI that I'm wrapping that rope around your necks.

                  ALEXANDRIA, LA—A former Union Bank employee was sentenced to 27 months in federal prison for making $962,740 in unauthorized withdrawals over and six-and-a-half-year period, United States Attorney Donald W. Washington announced today. Nancy Baudin Lemoine, 54, of Marksville, La., was also sentenced to three years of supervised release, 100 hours of community service, and was ordered to pay restitution to The Union Bank in the amount of $284,911.27. The sentence was imposed by U.S. District Judge Dee D. Drell.

                  What is going on at Union Bank when there are 2 situations within 5 years?  One with the FBI.  I don't know if this person was involved in anything like that, but I think there is a chance something nefarious is connected to this disappearance.  Also they were last seen at a State Park.  We know that there have been a lot of people disappearing from State Parks.

                   $284,911.27 ? Seems like a really odd number. Judge had to add his 27 cents? Could be a case of a crook, or someone above her using the information at their disposal to steal, and then frame. Notice how the top never serves time even when caught red handed? At 54 she would likely not be a threat for long if the second scenario were true. What would happen if you or I were to steal $962,740? Fact is that the banks can deposit that money in another bank and borrow 5 times the amount to fund projects, buy existing real estate, art, or whatever. They can then sell that for fiat, if a buyer is available, and make a huge profit. If someone on the upper floor invests it in something that went sour and could get them in trouble, then they need a patsy. I would imagine they actually hire people for just such a circumstance on a personality profile.

                    Makes you sick to think about it. That’s why we are not elites. As you say and me too glad to be where I am at.

                  Yeah, we are not in that bracket either.  Bank jobs used to be quite respected, now not so much.  If you are on the lower rung, you are in the poor house and the rest are all groveling for each other's jobs. Dog eat dog.  Yeah, I am glad too.  I wonder how many accidents like this there were in that area.  I think there were others.  I am being challenged because it is not on that very cliff right off the same spot.  What are the chances it happens one week later even that close.  I usually can smell a rat pretty well.

                I really appreciate that.  I  can see it too and I have looked into other things that I know as well.  I am going to exchange this for that gift you just sent me
