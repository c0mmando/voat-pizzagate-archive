<p>This is the quote from ex CIA Agent Robert Crowley from the website.</p>
<p>1950s: Origins of the CIA\'s &quot;Pedophile Academy&quot;</p>
<p><strong>“Oh we do have our stable of weird people working for us. Did I ever tell you about the Pedophile Academy? We actually had one down at Camp Peary, (in Virginia) right near (the CIA’s) Jim Critchfield’s place. I don’t know if you’re aware of it, but we called it ‘The Farm,’ and it was supposed to be a secret training center for young agents. Allen Dulles set up this training center down there for pedophiles. They were in training to seduce, molest, and most especially photograph the young children of targets. Not only, Allen reasoned, would our graduates have a spanking good time but they could get wonderful action photos of the wee ones to blackmail their families with. I understand they broke it up when one of the graduates nailed a (CIA) Deputy Director’s son at a summer camp.”</strong></p>
<p>Robert Crowley, CIA Domestic Contracts Division 1959-1962; Assistant Deputy Director of Operations (ADDO) 1980</p>
<p>I wrote about ex FBI spook Sibel Edmonds. She said something of similar lines and the op believes she was referring to Robert. </p>
<p>&quot;One of my FBI whistleblowers, and this was a decorated agent who never became a public whistleblower, but he went to court cases with the FBI internally because he DOJ IG, that is the Inspector General\'s office, etc.</p>
<p>One of the things this guy exposed, and I went to the media and I had this guy on the record with them but they never published, was: he was working between 1993 and 1997 in this division in the FBI, where one of his tasks was running background check on federal judge candidates, and this is during the Clinton administration, because those federal judges have to be cleared by the FBI. They look at their background: are they pedophiles, are they rapist, you know, do they have some financial nefarious activities etc.</p>
<p>And he said, during these four years, when this decorated FBI agent, and this was 10 years, or 7, 8 years before he blew the whistle, he was running background checks on these federal judges, the way they were selecting the ones to appoint were the ones who had the highest number of skeletons. Meaning, the government, the Clinton administration (this is the head of the FBI, this is the OJ), they did not want to appoint any federal judges to the bench, and go through the confirmation process, if the judges, or the candidates, didn\'t have enough skeletons, <strong>meaning they have to be rapists, pedophiles, despicable characters, and that information is collected during the background check, and then they are used against these judges, so the judges rule per government\'s instruction.</strong></p>
<p>Very simple, same thing, one of my main whistleblowing facts that I exposed, and this was between 2002 and 2006, and if people were to go and visit by state secrets gallery, there were going to see all these individuals, whether they were from the executive branch or congressional people, they were involved in the case I was exposing. And I talked about the fact that they were all blackmailed. Blackmailed by whom? They were blackmailed by the deep state.</p>
<p>So you sort of saying they formed a cold, I have to say what they do, *the deep state, they want to make sure that only blackmailable, maybe I made up a word here, only blackmailable candidates get to hold offices, whether executive offices, or they are in Congress, you know whether they are in courts, federal judges, if you\'re clean, if you\'re squeaky clean, and if you start running for a major seat position, the chances are you are not going to get there because you will be disqualified They don\'t want you there. They can not put pressure on you by a blackmail. So that\'s the answer to the questions: no we\'re not gonna join this crowd and talk about there is a cold, it is not about cold, this is how this corrupt system has been operating.&quot;</p>
<p>Can we verify that Robert Crowley said this and that this CIA pedophile farm exists? That website is the only source of that quote from what I can find. I want to add it to the officials list who spoke about this and make a YouTube video on it.</p>
<p>Edit: Mumbleberry says the posts came from two disinfo shills yet they both are massively upvoted with comments in the hundreds. Many from legit users and also mods. So I just want to confirm this is fake and disinfo because alot of people fell for it if it is. Combined they have close to 16,000 views. If it is I will delete this thread but I want to get a confirmation that Robert and this CIA pedophile farm is fake.</p>',

            That pic of alfentis with the baby saying "that little baby loved the farm" nearly made me cry.
Made me seeth with anger that this animal is allowed to publicly  post this on social media and nobody bats an eyelid.
He obviously has no connection to the baby as he referred  to it as "that baby"
I actually hate him more than hilary as he is openly pushing his sick business on social media.

            Upvoat! Thank you for compiling. I remember several instances of "the farm" will check and see if I can find a source too. Was also confusing b/c the cult place Julian Assange was partially raised also sometimes referred to as the "Farm or family"...something close. To limit our own confusion, If I find, I will say the Farm and whatever state or city instead of non-specific nouns. Thanks for all your compiling lately!!! The CDAN compilation also amazing!!!!!!

            Edmonds is Jewish and a gatekeeper. That quote is on YouTube, including the part where she says there's no satanic cult and how that's absurd etc.  Just the "deep state" which is a term from 1970s Turkey not used in the US until the pizzagatekeeping began 2 years ago.

              Her version doesn't make much sense anyway: there are thousands of federal judges, which would give an unrealistically high rate of pedophilic or criminal tendencies if they were simply sought among the legal professionals eligible for appointment.
             </p>
             <p>
              It is more intuitive they are groomed during their legal training at cabal-related institutions then recommended for appointment by cabal member Congressmen, perhaps due to bloodline.
             </p>
             <p>
              But since the legal profession in general is so heavily Jewish, this explanation would send people on a path she wants gated off.

             In the deleted post listed in the post I found an old comment made by me because of something I found on a map linked in a comment by Blacksmith  It is frightening now just as then

             OH PLEASE check out the Exceptional Children's Center when map is enlarged. The logo is Highly suspect and they have strange pics of knotted ropes hanging from the ceiling. I don't know what to make of this and need help here. I will continue but am not very good at it.

              I agree their logo is a little strange. It looks like a pedo swirl with a heart and a pentagram but most people see a scribble with a heart and star so it could be innocent. When you zoom out it looks like an e and a c together which may be how they came up with it.

              I found 17 businesses nearby with the name "Exceptional" whatever... which to me screams exceptional.
             </p>
             <p>
              The Occupational Therapist thing struck me as strange when I saw that is what it is, not because of helping severely disabled kids or anything but because of something that I cannot mention. I wonder if any of those businesses have any DEA licenses?
             </p>
             <p>
              It just seems strange to have that many businesses titling their company the same type of name all within a small area. I've never seen a business titled Exceptional anything before around where I live. Maybe it's just a regional quirk.

               I believe it is a message that it is a controlled area and those businesses are connected to that in some way.  There are now many of these examples, imo.  David G. is connected to many org. with the name Dream in them Dreamworks is one.  There are many others now.  I think this has become a thing with THEM lately or who knows for how long.  We are just finding them out.   I remember noticing that now as well at the time.  Other nearby places, same names.

                Yeah it's not like they named it after their city or metro area or the type of business that they have, it's just an adjective that doesn't get used a lot in business names. You could probably look up the key word exceptional in USAspending.gov and see if anything at all pops up.

                I found a bunch of small businesses getting government contracts for random stuff. It seems to be the wave. Maybe they are doing that? Just an idea. Could be off completely.

                 Idk, but there is a pattern Remember those businesses we were looking into with the name of Joseph?  All over the country.  It's becoming a thing I believe.

                   I am sorry that's all I remember.  We were looking into places around the country that started with the name Joseph.  I am just saying that they are clustering places together and using the same name game.  Maybe someone will remember this.

                     Maybe.  I never thought of it like that.  You would find things like Joseph's Coffee Shop, Joseph Klein Law Off. , etc. They were all different shops or businesses.

                         This comment may just be the answer, but who knows.  It could be something more nefarious.

                         My guess is; this is a tax scam. Open a business that isn't a business, keep pouring wages into capital for the. Business and take it off your taxes.

                          I just was watching this latest George Webb video and he describes how this one company DAI gave everyone visas to come in and work with the Awans and that they were issuing fake licenses for doctors, and taking business names and altering them by one letter at a time. This probably explains why the invisible bistro post was made. I would bet anything that the exceptional whatevers are running a similar racket.

             I'm not sure who the original op was. Also V____Z. is disinformation? I see over 118 comments talking about this on one thread and  81 on the other. If they are disinformation they gave bullshit to all those people. Both are massively upvoted.
