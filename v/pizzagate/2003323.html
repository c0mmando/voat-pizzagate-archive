            Hi -- Do you mean you can keep the virus program beyond 30 days, even if you don't buy it? (Kaspersky, that is)
           </p>
           <p>
            Since I ran Malwarebytes it seems the "Security/Certificate" messages haven't ceased, but now I'm also getting
many more of the "Do you want us to show full content?" messages.  Also, Internet Explorer keeps shutting down.
Mainly happens when I'm on Yahoo which is making me wonder if my Yahoo account was compromised?
But the "Security warning" doesn't say what website it is accusing of not having a valid certificate.
Plus you can't close down the warnings (though it would probably be a bad idea anyway) ... 
Was thinking this was due to hot weather here which we're in about third week of now, but honestly
we've had really hot weather many times and haven't had these problems before so I'm getting worried.
           </p>
           <p>
            Malwarebytes is a 13 day trial -- guess they let loose what's in quarantine if you don't buy the program?
           </p>
           <p>
            But nothing has improved since I added Malwarebytes ... oddly enough!
           </p>
           <p>
            :)

            It doesn't have the same feel that it used to have -- don't have confidence in it
and will be trying shortly to go back to AVAST or something like that.
At the moment, I've put Malewarebytes on to check and they reported 100 "potential" 
threats that they've quarantined.  Don't know what to think about that but something
hasn't felt right for a few weeks.  Meanwhile, IE continues to fade more and more and
only possibility can be HEAT here or virus.  Ugh!

           <p>
            I've used it for like 20 years, I think .... but I have to say not as confident in it as I used
to be and that lack of confidence began about three years ago.  I used to use AVG with
Zone Alarm and all seemed well.  Now that I'm using both ZA anti-virus and their Fire Wall
I'm not as happy.  Somewhere along the way they went private -- I think it used to all be
free???

            You don't understand ... asking me to deal with plug in's or any other complication is like
asking me to drive a shift car.  Yep, I was also sorry that I didn't catch what my Sister was
doing and also just buy a 7 program (but they have plans also to end support for that program...
not just sure when) -- I loved the 7.

            OK ... just checked download.com and I think actually it was OPERA ... really liked it -- 
funny how you remember things!

            I'm not much on turning things off and on the computer!

           <p>
            Zone Alarm security has been trying to get me to update my anti-virus, I think -- 
may be my fire wall .... not sure which.  But the program which exists is FREE and 
can't be updated.  The new FREE one can be put on my computer but I have to turn
off and uninstall the old one to do it.  And, I've been putting that off for two/three months
now because I'm not confident I can do it!!  Will wait for my son to do it for me.  :)

            No -- not Pale Moon.  I'll take a look now cause want to find something to run on my computer 
as don't know if it's the heat here (95 in NJ today!) or if it's some problem with security but 
IE keeps having to close programs and folding.  In old XP, the screens used to freeze and 
Microsoft never did anything about that.
           </p>
           <p>
            Haven't seen one of those "script" turn off messages since I have 8.1 and the way
my son set it up I'm fairly OK.
           </p>
           <p>
            You CAN'T "uninstall" IE as it's the default browser should anything go wrong.
And that issue has come up a couple of times in the past.
And I think that's why MS and IE are so fussy at times because putting another 
browser on to replace IE means that they are never 100% compatible.
           </p>
           <p>
            Aaaah.... you went to 10 .... Oh ..... 
Don't know how many people went from 8.1 to 10 but I really didn't want to.
My sister moved her XP to a 7 for $100 bucks I think as she didn't want 8.1 or 10.
They continue to support the 7 though think they have withdrawn some of the servicing of it.
But she's gotten at least 2 or 3 years out of it so far.
           </p>
           <p>
            PLUS, I'm kinda a computer dummy versus what so many others know about computers --
and especially about researching which is so important here.  My powers of research are very
limited.

            ITK7:This page is NOT an expose on the Roman Catholic Church, but an overview of  the bloody Society of Jesus (Company of Jesus) aka Jesuits: 500yr-old  All-MALE [homosexual] ROMAN CATHOLIC MILITARY ORDER; The Sovereign MILITARY ORDER of St. John The Hospitalier of Rhodes &amp; Malta aka SMOM Knights of Malta, wielding unchecked power behind the scenes. Centuries of  high level Satanists  practicing ancient Babylonian-Egyptian style Mass Human (Child) Sacrifices to Molech, directed by  Superior/Father Generals (Black Popes) &amp; General Councils, Jesuit Provincials and Coadjutors throughout the world. This is the true power behind the Vatican, Papacy and Holy See, Roman Curia (Cardinals) — sworn to uphold bloody Oath of The Fourth Vow...
Jesuits (formerly monks) now masquerade in the guise of priests (plain black suits &amp; white clergy collars) command Popes, Cardinals &amp; Archbishops of the Roman Catholic Church. In devout service to their dark overlord they’re responsible for Inquisitions/Crusades (genocidal campaigns) which continue present day — WW1, WW2, Korean War, Vietnam (Conflict) countless political assassinations, current Crusade against Islamic world and coming WW3 are ALL Jesuit inspired plots…

            Following dictates of Ignatius Loyola’s “25 Sessions” and leadership of Superior General, ultimate goal of this secret organization is to, “Destroy and rebuild the Temple of Solomon, reestablishing the seat of the Pope in Israel.” 
Historically, the Jesuit mission has been to eliminate Protestant Christianity throughout the world, with United States being the last frontier to be conquered. Contrary to the self-proclaimed mission to educate and assist the underprivileged in society, the Jesuits actually worship Lucifer (not Satan) and practice the most sadistic forms of human sacrifice, homosexuality, pedophilia, black magic, and murder.
The Society employs a variety of ruthless tactics to accomplish its long-term goal (of a New World Order which pays homage to their Black Pope). One is carrying out political assassinations of world leaders who refuse to comply with its demands. These assassinations in the U.S. have included presidents (Abraham Lincoln, JFK), cabinet members, congressmen, senators, diplomats, journalists, scientists and religious and business leaders.

            Da Vinci Code by Brown had some important messages for believers and
Opie took it and made a car chase movie of it for 11 year olds.

            Jesus was actually supposed to be the New Testament's "White Hat" response
to the Old Testament and a violent god ... i.e., the dark side.
           </p>
           <p>
            Jesus figure is in rebellion against Old Testament god and teaching of male-superiority.
Brown points out likelihood married to Mary and had children who survived.
Thus the alleged search for the Holy Grail is FOR Mary, the vessel which delivered children
descended from Jesus.  Actually ... I think they wanted to kill them. 
Other myths are that Jesus survived and lived on with family.
           </p>
           <p>
            Old and New Testaments are inter-dependent as far as saving organized patriarchal
religions, but they are also battling myths - one of a violent god and the other of Jesus
who was basically a "commie."  :)

            Don't think even Joseph Kennedy had wealth that lasted for generations as he did get his
money out of the market before the crash, but it would have been investments which 
preserved the wealth.  At the rate they were procreating however I'm sure it's needed some
shoring up.  Recall JFK wasn't too happy with Jackie O's spending.

            Eso --
Agree re Microsoft -- and also loved the XP2000.  Only got rid of it about 3 years ago!
And I had it for more than 10 years.
            <br/>
            Always used to use Norton anti-virus and used to pay by check.  One year, the download
didn't work properly and though they refunded my money it left me open to a virus.
If you recall the XP used to have a RESTORE feature where you could take the computer 
backwards in time and it also had a COMPLETE restore where you could take the computer
back to the day you bought it.  So that's what I did -- my son actually did it for me.
And no problems after that.
           </p>
           <p>
            It also does seem like computers and cell phones were invented to spy on us.
            <br/>
            Did you see SNOWDEN movie?  He was pointing out that NSA is spying on twice as many
US citizens as citizens anywhere else -- including "terrorist" areas.
           </p>
           <p>
            Oh -- good luck on Linux.  Used to think that was going to be the solution, but can't figure it out at all.
My son is kind of our "technician" when he visits -- we just make him stay 'til he fixes our computer or cell phones.  :)
           </p>
           <p>
            My son used to have a Mac and loved it, but very expensive.
           </p>
           <p>
            The other browsers, I'd have to go to Download.com to remember them...
At some point in next day or two I'll do that and will let you know.  I think one began with a "P"
and I really liked it and I think the other was Safari -- but don't know if they still exist.
           </p>
           <p>
            I'll be back at some point.

            We are also suffering here (NJ) with huge heat wave which has been going on long time...
certainly last week and continuing this week.  It knocked out pm TV last week for at least
two nights into like 5am.  Never saw that happen before.
Funny how we all thought that "cable" TV meant putting the cable underground -- but it didn't -- !!!

            Very much agree with you re Chrome, but there are other browsers which I've used before which
are very good.  The problem is that IE is the default and any time you add another browser it will
after a while begin to cause a problem for the new one.  At least, that's been my experience.

            CIA represents all Elites -- 
John Stockwell (CIA whistleblower who can be seen on YouTube as well as text) points to the
CIA as "Catholics In Action."

            Hmm, the OP says "three possible suspects" and "maybe a combination of the three", followed by a list of only two things.  If there was a third thing that is now missing from the OP, that's the one to concentrate on all right.  OP, what was the third thing?

            What's their deal though? Why do they have to control stuff?

           <p>
            Well, it's because the Governments of the world are more paranoid than the most shizoid 'conspiracy theorist' there ever was

            Kontrol is not just about roboticizing people.  It's about Alchemy. The powers that shouldn't be, all these supranationalist 'chess players' are actually Gnostic Globalists.  Political Alchemists. Or witches.  Take your pick.  It's all freemasons and jesuits from the 10M level and up
           </p>
           <p>
            And what's Alchemy about?  It's about recasting society by breaking it down alchemically.  That's why you have phoenixes everywhere.  Peacocks are phoenixes, Eagles are actually phoenixes, symbolically.  It's all about civilization building by big expansions and a series of smaller contractions, hoping to grow the market.  Like the ebb and flow of the financial markets
           </p>
           <p>
            This is the essence of systems theory and control grid. It's about gas and brakes and doesn't matter how much suffering and anxiety is created.  That stuff is great for revenue building...because you sell the solution and you also sell the problems and then you sell the therapy.  When your'e selling everything, you always make money
           </p>
           <p>
            It's also about creating chimeras.  It's about morphic freedom and alchemy as much as it is some kind of nihilistic/existential digital ideation to become a robotlord of simulation--
           </p>
           <p>
            It's not enough for them to create a technoneofeudalist empire of draconian mkontrol over all the human condition to have mentally enslaved zombies x forever (ie: phantomzon'd reality).  They want THAT plus they want to create simulated wars, simulated suffering, simulated anxiety x forever, because that's feeding their energy, which manifests itself from higher dimensions into this lower dimension as the dollar and as money
           </p>
           <p>
            Money is really just a measure of anxiety in higher dimension is what I'm saying.  I know that's kind of abstract and abstruse but it's true I assure you.
           </p>
           <p>
            As far as the lower dimensional denizens puppeted as avatars by higher dimensional demons (or lower dimensions however you want to view it), what is their aim while they are here?
           </p>
           <p>
            1) they are trying to figure out if they can make it to space and beyond.  That's what's with the Musk-eteers and GD discount Lex Luthor trying to get to space (Jeff Bezos)
           </p>
           <p>
            The moment they do, they'll may kill all of us, because they will want to return to Earth when it's nice and poor person free; They won't until they can get to space--in fact they need all of us to help build up revenue and resource and technology to enable them to get that space elevator and/or tech to get them to space easily.
           </p>
           <p>
            Then they will basically start killing off people without advanced STEM degrees.  They want to feed off higher forms of energy, which means people who have higher IQs because their suffering is much more complexified, and 'fascinating'  Then they will deploy eugenics to create another larger pool of resource to get more anxiety/energy/money from because when everyone is in space then clearly they must be at the multi millionaire level--at some point they'll just declare 100M dollars to be 1 dollar for simpicity sake and then they are literally wild west out in space
           </p>
           <p>
            2) On the steering side: they want to basically evolve to the higher form they think humanity will take--but chances are aliens won't allow that.  You have to conquer your dark side and get good with ethics before you can emerge from the cocoon of obsolescence, 3) Jesuits have always wanted to control history and science because they believe that they are entitled to dominate and control everyone and the most effective way (and cost effective way) to do that is through mind control--even better when you make money doing it (television, big sports, film)
           </p>
           <p>
            If you want to know more about how the jesuits work, go back to webster tarpley talking about the fraud of newton.  It's pretty eye opening.

            What happened last night?  I was on for 5 minutes around 1am and didn't notice anything - but I was only on one thread

            We should look into ports - there's a Seattle port that seems interesting

            Both 4chan and Voat went down right after somebody started posting about something called "the invisible bistro."

            I have no idea what that means because when I clicked on the information... SERVER INTURRUPTION ERROR.

            I don't forgive.

             Good point. I do admit that I overlooked this one as part of a possible suspect list. It is a good thing to look at.

              You aren't going to believe this.   Just checked out one of these locations in a town, did a reverse look up of the telephone number  and guess who it was associated with....
             </p>
             <p>
              a 9th Circuit Court Judge  Home address.
             </p>
             <p>
              It is not his home tel #  but associated with him via  Intelius.com. and given as a result on  anywho
             </p>
             <p>
              His home address is (this is gross)  on Hampstead Lane

             If it's the invisible bistro (yes, I read it and it contained great info and new leads), do the strikes rearrange and bury these posts? I remember it being popular so is it in its natural order? Or do these strikes push it back or make it "invisible" so it doesn't attract attention? It seems as if the moderator would be the one to know this.

              General disruption of the process of collecting information and the analysis of patterns would be my guess. It's only natural that people are going to think that their pet theory was what triggered it.

               My guess also. I can more tell from shill posting what's a topic the Cannibal Elite want buried. There's a flurry of shit posts to knock solid posts off the main page. The strikes are for different purposes.

             Re "the invisible bistro" ... think someone besides you suggested it was one of more important threads...
staying in line with theories about Jesuits I noticed this ...
**Jesuits work in many roles in parish and retreat ministry, in high schools and colleges, as lawyers, doctors, psychologists and ... Opus Dei, Knights of Malta) **

             The invisible bistro, wasn't that about how there was multiple businesses registered at a single address and someone found a connection related to bistros that didn't exist? Did more stuff get deleted?

                here you can look at a list of all their locations, they are literally every where they have almost twice as many locations as McDonald's in the USA supposedly. I was suprised how many where close to me since where I live is pretty rural.

             In a religious context the name of Joseph has a father-son relationship with the name of Jacob, with the great tribulation or apocalypse being that of Jacob. The father-son relationship is important here because of the historical problem of the traditions of the fathers, the curse relating to cannibalism (Deu 28:53) and the symbolism of the ritual of communion, which of course connects back to the Jesuits.

            Actually I was going to ask if anyone else here had any "security" messages about certification of websites ...
which one or ones not clear.  It resulted in my dumping a lot of information. And it seemed to begin after I picked up 
a link to "Thanks for the Memories" here which is book by survivor of sexual abuse who claimed Bob Hope was her controller/mentor.  Not sure that I don't still have the problem.  And I did report it to Mods.
           </p>
           <p>
            How knowledgeable do these "shills" have to be about the reality behind this subject?
Obviously a lot of the "shills" working for Media Matters and Hillary seemed amateurs.
Of course, Alefantis seemed to have contacted someone posting here re the "Museum."

              Yes, I do recall that now that you mentioned it -- 
I had really missed a lot of the beginnings of that story.
Whatever happened, it allowed the maker of the video to report the 
conversation he had with Alefantis and I believe there was a strong threat involved.
             </p>
             <p>
              I also think the Pegasus Museum video was up as well at YouTube?
And that Alefantis threatened him in regard to taking that down ...
not sure if it was totally personal harm threat or whether it was also 
legal action?
             </p>
             <p>
              Thanks for keeping a lookout on reporting here, especially when someone like me
gets it wrong way around.  :)

               Yeah it's easy to get it mixed up. Ryan is the guy, I live very near him so that's been partly my interest in keeping up. I think it started (the whole clip is available of course online) when Alefantis actually replied to Ryan after Ryan contacted him to do an "AMA" via facebook, Ryan had just put the Pegasus video up when this happened and it hit a nerve w/ Alefantis. Don't know how Alefantis knew it was Ryan (of the Pegasus video) though when Ryan contacted him. Maybe Ryan told him? Alefantis threatened his whole family. There's a lot of areas concerning Pizzagate where I myself am missing plenty of pieces.
              </p>
              <p>
               Ryan filed reports w/ FBI and local police (I know some of them but don't talk to them about it, police chiefs I mean). What's so weird about the whole thing is that Alefantis' texting with Ryan, and the phone call, was all supposed to remain private, so Alefantis just went berserk, thinking no one would ever know about it. But Ryan spilled the beans.

the postings are as valid and truthful as possible.   For that - thanks.

            I've read a few articles saying they the Jesuits stonghold is Ireland and that is where their main power source comes from,  it is an extremely powerful place for them and it can be for us.  Reclaim Ireland and we can defeat the cabal.

            So we go from the clintons/podesta/letter agencies to heavy breathing to the Jews to elsa and now freaking jesuits? Anyone notice  how we keep getting further and further away from the actual swamp?? I'm all for the esoteric, as long as it leads back to the shit going on right now with people who can be held accountable right now. No one is going to prison for being a Jesuit. Follow the money, indeed, and uncover the lies and corruption - be it Jew, gentile, or lizard person.

             My exact thoughts. Sorry, but the OP has something about it that's not right. There's so much at the local / immediate / obvious level, so much evidence, so many leads, already discovered, that we dont need to look at the fcking Jesuits. We'll never know if the attack was about what in particular, but really, how about the fact this forum is constantly shining the light on and uncovering pedo-related shit by the day!!!  So no particular post or angle imo, just the fact this site is a constant and unnerving hotbed for making these need-to-die kiddie fckers sweat real bad.

              It is said among  researchers  that  the  JESUITS  are the real power  behind the Zionists  and  the  world,  don't  discount the  Jesuits, they are a (the?) major power  behind the  PTB-the  real  power  brokers are  not standing  in  the  light  of  day

               I think you have been trolled. Let me elaborate....
              </p>
              <p>
               Judaism not only predates but is the basis for both Christianity and Islam. Jesus Christ the savior of the Christians, second to last prophet of the Muslims, was born and died a Jew. The Koran equates the Jewish God Jehova as being Allah and accepts the entire Christ story. Only 0.2% of the world’s population is Jewish, but Judaism is the foundation for Christianity, the biggest, most believed religion in the world with 33% of the world’s population following it, and the basis for Islam, the second biggest, most believed religion with 23% of the world following it. The followers of the Judeo-Christian-Muslim mythos therefore are fundamentally all under a form of Jewish mind control. The papacy, world royalty, and Zionist Jewry all claim their “divine right to rule” from their Old Testament Jewish God. Big name Christian televangelists and authors are constantly defending Israel and zealously encouraging Christians to support the Jewish holyland.

              <p>
               Now the smoking guns!!
              </p>
              <p>
               Ignatius Loyola, the founder of the Jesuits was Jewish, Adam Weishaupt the founder of the Illuminati was Jewish, and Karl Marx the founder of communism, the greatest vehicle of democide in modern history was Jewish. Even the Pope and all his Vatican cardinals wear their little Jew hats (yarmulkes).

                Your post  nevertheless-there  is a  strong  debate  among researchers who  the real  power in  the world  today is-Jews or the  Jesuits?  There  is a  plethora of documentation on  the  Jews, yet very little  is available re: real  Jesuit power  behind  the  scenes

                Marx did not create communism.

                Communism is true Christianity and complete rule and empowerment of the people or com.unity to benefit themselves.
All of themselves. Communism dont murder or harm none of its people.
Both of the greatest Commu ists, who built great Empires and liberated people of all walks of life,
banned abortion, which is the beast that births pizzagate and every other evil  abomination that webs from it.
               </p>
               <p>
                It(Communism) is nature- natural, the rule of WoMandkind over their existence, as opposed to gods and chosens ruling over them.

                It is as old as the time when the first people on earth gathered together to survive,  then build.

                The only time Communism becomes a bane to the people is when they give up their guns, unity and beliefs in their inalienable rights... to the few

             I noticed the same thing. They failed to debunk Pizzagate, so now they are trying to pin it on a scapegoat group. People need to to polish up their critical thinking skills.

               There's a term from Freemasonry called the "blue degrees". It's used to describe people who believe that they are doing the right thing but are actually advancing the agenda of the "black degrees", the people who are aware of the satanic/adversarial nature of the their work.

             I'd argue we're going deeper into the swamp. This isn't a swamp, its a murky oily abyss that takes us straight to the depths of hell.
            </p>
            <p>
             We're not going away from the swamp so much as we're uncovering more and more layers of the swamps. Podesta and Clinton being the starting point leads to further connections until we find the heart of it all.
            </p>
            <p>
             Remember, this mess is a vile spider web of evil and corruption. Follow the money and the connections as you're saying.

              Jesuits are involved including 30 Jesuit Universities across the US and two others in Canada. The Marquette Mafia for example including corrupt Governor Scott Walker is known to run the corrupt Wisconsin executive, judicial and legislative branches, and are in partnership with various mafia and religious groups linking back to Pilgrims Society, Kabbalah, Black Nobility and the Council of 13. They are all working together using Interfaith Coalitions, Service Clubs, and Foundations, along with corrupt corporations such as SC Johnson, Bayer, Dow, DuPont, Monsanto and many others across every major industry. Corrupt religious groups, the mafia, street gangs and secret societies have deep roots in Racine, Chicago and Milwaukee and are tied to the Podestas, Emanuels, Clintons, and other power players.

              The Clintons started several NWO initiatives in Racine including Sustainable Development and Community Policing which led to Agenda 2030. There is a reason the area is known for having the highest infant mortality rates and highest incarceration rates for black males in the nation. There is a reason why corrupt Boy Scouts Reince Prebus, Scott Walker and Paul Ryan are so powerful. It is for what they are hiding in Racine, Wisconsin - the real truth about Pizzagate, Global Criminal Corruption and the path to Complete Global Enslavement.

                Yes it is part of the group of 28 in the U.S. with 2 more in Canada, and Omaha is a major hub for Pizzagate and Global Criminal Corruption. Prominent members of the Omaha community are part of the same circles as in Racine, Wisconsin including the Pilgrims Society.

                We know why Paul Ryan was really on the plane with Loretta Lynch and Bill Clinton. It is about the corrupt Church, the corrupt State, the corrupt mafia, corrupt corporations, and corrupt institutions making deals between them all. It really was a meeting between Paul Ryan and Bill Clinton. Loretta Lynch was given her orders.
               </p>
               <p>
                They are hiding the real Truth in Racine, Wisconsin - Paul Ryan's district.
               </p>
               <p>
                It is not only the Jesuits and corruption within the Catholic church, but a coalition between many religious groups for One World Religion. The partnership between Paul Ryan and Mitt Romney was only the beginning. Now they have partnered with FLDS, OTO, Kabbalah and other groups including Tom DeLonge, Peter Lavenda, Podestas, Evan McMullin, Emanuels, Obama, Ashton Kutcher, and others to unite the world with Sustainability, Community Policing, Aliens and AI.

                It is Luciferian and goes back to ancient times. Racine is the ROOT of it all. Wisconsin has major historical significance, and is a model for the real world agenda:

            happens to me daily
           </p>
           <p>
            today, the caller id # was     385-249-5015
           </p>
           <p>
            where is that?   I don't bother looking the #'s up anymore.
           </p>
           <p>
            ALSO - to those of you who do not know...
           </p>
           <p>
            If keeping copies of VOAT posts on your computer (I have some that are in folders and organized for later reference),  make copies of your folders on an external hard drive and disconnect that from your computer after use.  "they" (whoever they are) can - not only delete files from your computer but can do it on attached memory as well.   If you ever "lose" a file, look on your back up and you will find it there.
           </p>
           <p>
            These people also put backdated articles on the web.  So if you think you remembered that something happened - whatever event - and look online, it will make you think you remembered it wrong.
           </p>
           <p>
            That just happened with a zika virus article.  WHO / CDC came out with the Zika scare in Feb. 2016.  I know because I followed it and documented the entire timeline.  Recently, I found an article online about it that was backdated to Jan. 2016 - before the Zika scare started.  It was all fake.
           </p>
           <p>
            Just an FYI.

             I too had files deleted right off my thumb drive.
            </p>
            <p>
             I decided to give a screen video a try. I tried to upload the video on a freeby site, but it failed to process.
            </p>
            <p>
             I went back to my thumb drive to grab files and type it out manually, and there was nothing on it.  Gone.
            </p>
            <p>
             Fortunately im so disorganized that my shit was saved everywhere. Not gonna lie, it spooked me. Then later that evening, several devices in my house had to re-enter the wifi password. Not my phone or computer though. 🤔
            </p>
            <p>
             Something in that video triggered my file swipe.

             Here's the topic that I was discussing in my vid, if someone wants to dig a little deeper. It was a discussion of the pentagam streets in dc. My interest was in this place. A nightclub, sleepcenter, and childcare all in a building located right next to the railroad track.

             Racine is what they are scared of.
            </p>
            <p>
             Zika was a test run connected to Racine, Wisconsin through the Johnsons who own the world's most advanced mosquito lab and their partners the Rockefellers who own the patent to the Zika virus. This ties to the takeover of the world's food, energy, and water supplies, and to the real truths about Sustainable Development, Community Policing, Education reform, and Agenda 2030.
            </p>
            <p>
             What the elite are really scared of is here on Voat.
            </p>
            <p>
             It is Racine, Wisconsin - a main Root and weak link to the entire system of Pizzagate and Global Criminal Corruption. The only way for the world to change is if we Unite behind a Common Truth - that truth is in Racine, WI - Paul Ryan's district. It all leads back to the Pilgrims Society, Black Nobility, Committee of 300 and Council of 13.
            </p>
            <p>
             You are on the right track. They use Racine as a root and model for Pizzagate and Global Criminal Corruption, so we will use Racine as a root and model for the Real Truth which is the only way to save the world from Evil before it is too late. They are on a path to Complete Global Enslavement by controlling resources, information, automation, and artificial intelligence.
            </p>
            <p>
             Sustainable development began in Racine, but Sustainability is not about the world being sustainable for US, it is about the world being sustainable for THEM. This is the ultimate truth that the world needs to know. Our world is based on a system of lies and corruption for enslavement from Cradle to Grave.

             this happened to me with West Nile Virus. the articles I distinctly remembered reading when it first was reported in 1999 found in pigeons in the Bronx zoo, the details were changed and other articles are missing. (one of several viruses escaped or released from Plum Island).

            I thought the same thing this morning - we hit a nerve.  Hopefully everyone has their research backed up locally.

            I've noticed older accounts coming out of the woodwork trying to throw out red herrings like this Whitmore Farm/Walkin BS. It may be the real deal - it's just not the same machine. Or people claiming Shit about the podestas going to a non existent HS in Arlington.
           </p>
           <p>
            I think they are getting desperate. We are taking their only argument away. Hammer it home. Look at what else the jesuits have infected. Start looking at politicians.

              You still have not linked the "kill room" freezer to Whitmore Farms.  Why is this so difficult.  So fucking what he teaches "Zionism".  "Zionism" only refers to the establishment of Israel as a Jewish state.

               Israel was established with the patriarchs long before Herzl's plan for a Zionist state came to fruition. The significance of Zionism is that it ties their statism to the statism of the United States of America, two groups of people who identify not by with the land but by their politics. Statism as a political system is closely aligned with the Roman Catholic Church, being the official religion of the Roman Empire, in contrast to a sovereign system based on the principles which lead to real sovereign immunity.

            I found the names of the Black Nobility families. These are the "kings" of the satanist rot on this planet. Might be difficult to obtain leads on these people without running into a  unch of esoteric crap. Then again, they're probably big time into the occult.

              Mayflower -- bloodline to Jesus -- to Founders - to aliens?

              Is there any agreement on what we're talking about here?

                There is no "Lucifer" and there is no "Satan" nor "Devil" or "Hell" ....

                These are the inventions of organized patriarchal religions in order to frighten members into obedience.
RCC actually controlled normal human sexuality of members from their pulpits.
Worked to keep birth control from citizens of the nation and prevented women from having abortions,
even if they were carrying a dead child for months!
Convinced parents of homosexual children to abandon them -- thrown them out of their homes.
               </p>
               <p>
                We have to remember this is the "Church" of the Inquisition and of the Witch Burnings ...
See:  Hammer of Witches
                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malleus_Maleficarum">
                 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malleus_Maleficarum
                </a>
               </p>
               <p>
                This is also the RCC which issued edicts which called for the "Enslavement or Killing" of native peoples on this land -- and same for Africans enslaved here.
               </p>
               <p>
                This is the RCC which ran the government "Church schools" where native children who had been kidnapped were brought, their braids cut, their clothing changed and they were not permitted to speak their own language.  These children were beaten, hung, mutilated and sexually abused.
Mormon Church was also involved in running "church schools" for US government.
               </p>
               <p>
                But ... let's remember that it was our own government which designed these programs as part of the Genocide vs the native people here - - 112 million are now thought to have been killed. -- and that it is our own government which saved and protected the system of slavery for Elites, even down to the "Runaway Slave Act."
This guaranteed the Civil War which also benefitted Elites by splitting the nation into two camps of hatred which still echo on today preventing a uniting of citizens.
               </p>
               <p>
                The Old World religions which came thousands and thousands of years before organized patriarchal religions had no devil, no Satan and certainly no Hell, but were based in Nature.
               </p>
               <p>
                The Old Testament was written to cement patriarchy and moved teachings to the "one all male god" -- 
a very violent god to be sure.

                 I'm not going to tell you what to believe, but these people believe they have a special bloodline. Worshiping evil deities in private speaks volumes. See Bohemian Grove, spirit cooking, Aleister Crowley.

                 </p>
                 <p>
                  Aliens, Jesus ... who may have actually have been a alien?
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  Or were all of the "gods" of myth simply people who greater technology, greater
intelligence, but not necessarily using that intelligence for anything we might admire?
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  And I'm familiar with all of the evils you are pointing to and I have pointed to many.
The question is why those evils are so quickly forgotten when it comes to our government
or religion?

            If you go after the the Vatican Jesuits, your at the door of the hornets nest for sure. Last time I heard, the Queen herself is head of the Knights of Malta. But there is slso other things going on in the financial market right now. The whole block chain and being able to attach information to it is very fascinating.

              It's pretty darn interesting, now to be able to access this information is another question all together. Time will reveal all, no stone will remain unturned. Assange is smart, there is so much more information that he has not released yet. This inbedded information on the block chain is probably what is keeing him alive. Just my thoughts.

            History of the Jesuits
           </p>
           <p>
            From the Book "THE HISTORY OF GERMANY" by Wolfgang Menzel [In four volumes. This quote is From Volume 3 pg 1072. Book not dated but was written in mid to late 1800's. Menzel, Wolfgang, 1798-1873]
           </p>
           <p>
            "The Society of Jesus was founded by Ignatius Loyola, an enthusiastic Spaniard, for penitents, who, in those heretical times, ere long made it their business to confirm the faith of the wavering, and, consequently, became the tools of Rome. Benedict XIV, named them St. Peter's Janissaries.
           </p>
           <p>
            Their object was the restoration of unlimited hierarchical power, and they despised no means, however base, that might conduce to success, according to their celebrated maxim, "The end justifies the means."
           </p>
           <p>
            The society was intended to form an aristocracy of talent, whose office it was to guard the avenues of knowledge against the rest of mankind; and, as a precaution against individual treachery, no member was permitted to quit the order except to take the vows of a Carthusian, by which he bound himself to silence and solitude for the rest of his days.
           </p>
           <p>
            The heads of the society had unlimited power to remove, punish, and assassinate the members. The first vow taken by the initiated was that of unconditional obedience. A system of secret espionage pervaded the whole society; suspicion was condemnation; and the victim was sentenced to die in seclusion of starvation, as it expressly directed by Suarez, the great Jesuitical casuist.
           </p>
           <p>
            The members were divided into classes, the highest of which, the professors, elected the head or general of the whole order, who resided at Rome. Every province of the order was under the superintendence of a pater provincialis. The higher grades were kept strictly secret from the lower classes, who were merely the blind tools of the former.  The pope conferred the most extensive privileges upon the order, which was empowered to interfere everywhere with the clergy and with all other orders. -- And, in order to renew the times of the first apostles, the Jesuits sent out missionaries, who visited the most distant parts of the globe, for the purpose of converting the heathen and --- of taking possession of the New World.  They brought countless treasure into Europe, by means of which they placed themselves on a firm footing and acquired immense influence at a period when money was power.
           </p>
           <p>
            The most celebrated of these missionaries was St. Xavier, who met with a martyr's death in India. Numbers of the Jesuits shared the same fate; many, in particular Germans, were distinguished for piety and learning and by their exploration of unknown countries. Among the European Jesuits were many fervent spirits actuated by the purest zeal; many simple and poetical minds unstained by hypocrisy, for instance, Balde; many deeply learned men, sincere lovers of truth.
           </p>
           <p>
            It would be unjust to pass a sweeping condemnation upon all the Jesuits.  But the ruling spirit and the political effect of the order were immoral.
           </p>
           <p>
            The manner in which they denied the truths brought to light during the Reformation, sought to veil them by bringing to view the weaknesses and errors of Protestantism, or to suppress them by force, cannot be justified.
           </p>
           <p>
            The sophistry with which they still defended undeniable and long-sensible abuses was revolting to reason.  The means by which they bent the powerful and wealthy to their purposes were often the most unholy.
           </p>
           <p>
            pg1074
One of the principle objects of the Jesuits was to replace the sale of dispensations, which had fallen into bad repute since the Reformation, and which was, moreover, almost indispensable to the church. This was done by means of the lax morality of the confessional.  The more luxurious court life became, the more easily did the Jesuits forgive the sins committed by the aristocracy;  in order to pacify the new conscientious scruples awakened by the Reformation, they became the advocates instead of the judges of sins, from every description of which they, by their casuistry, exculpated the offender.
           </p>
           <p>
            The Spanish Jesuits went furthest. The book of Escobar, the confessor's manual, passed through thirty-six editions, which were printed under the direction of the society and of the church.  The church closed her eyes to any measures taken by the confessors, provided they made proselytes and gathered the stray sheep into the fold.
           </p>
           <p>
            According to their casuistical system, all sins were exculpated: First, by the doctrine of probabilismus, that is, by the mildest of all possible interpretations.
           </p>
           <p>
            A says, "Such a sin is too horrible to be forgiven."  B says, "Certainly; still it might thus be exculpated, " etc. etc.  Upon this C says, "According to A's opinion it cannot be forgiven; but it can be according to B's; and as an authority is all that is requisite, and the mildest point of view is admissible, I agree with B." 
Secondly, By the directio intentionis, that is, by the thoughts being occupied during the performance of a bad action with an innocent object. Thus, for instance, one might bribe another or accept of a bribe and, at the same time, be merely thinking of civility or gratitude.
           </p>
           <p>
            Thirdly, By the reservatio mentalis. It was allowable to take a false oath by voluntarily adding a mental reservation, as, for instance, a man might swear he had no money, although he had some, provided he mentally added "none to lend," etc.   One might take an oath thus, "I swear (that I say here, although it is untrue) that I, " etc. or "I swear that I did not do that (a hundred years ago or a hundred miles hence), " or " I swear to do so (if I cannot think of something else)."
           </p>

           <p>
            This is getting long.   Someone can let me know if they want me to type up the rest.

              thanks for the compliment but I don't know where the thread is (is it  voat/v/jesuits? or on this board).

            I don't think it had anything to do with the threads posted. Why? Because shill posts get put up and bury important ones. None of that happened. Maybe they were trying to find out identities?Or it could be older posts.
           </p>
           <p>
            Totally agree that we're doing our job. The shills are everywhere.

             Agree with you because I think it is the staying power and continued research which naturally
threatens them and the fact that VOAT still stands -- something they'd obviously like to change.
            </p>
            <p>
             Whether it's something specific, who knows?
But they face the likely hood that if VOAT researchers keep going that they will break through.
Also, just consider how inconvenient knowing the "pedophile" code words makes things for them.
            </p>
            <p>
             Further, I look with suspicion on the gang of anti-Jewish posters who contribute nothing else.

              darknight, that is not going to happen on Voat, unless individual users are spamming the domain name and get reported to
              <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/v/ReportSpammers">
               v/ReportSpammers
              </a>
              . Voat's anti-censorship policy means only spam gets IP-banned. The one exception is true doxing with death threats.

            The Rothschilds don't work alone.  Its not a case of 'either/or', both the Jesuits and the Rothschilds are at the center of a lot of very nasty shit.  I would bet they have an alliance at the very top, and with an alliance, its not really important who is marginally more powerful or influential.  BOTH are.

            In medieval times, power over society was divided into two groups, civil and military.  Civil power was held by bishops, priests, Popes.  The tithe was the original form of income tax.  Confession, that was just a way of collecting intelligence.

            Military power was held by kings.  That is why kings lived in castles.  They were in charge of the army.  That is why a king that led his soldiers into battle was so impressive (and inspiring) to the soldiers.   Because, ultimately, that was his job!  The king staying safe back in the castle just gave the soldiers the impression the king thought it was too dangerous, or not worth his efforts.
So it would make sense in the modern world too, for duties to be shared.  "You handle banking.  We will handle religion."

            I have no idea, but the timing does support a daytime attack from Europe so either or both of your possible suspects.
