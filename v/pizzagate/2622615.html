<p>The Arabic-language Al-Hadath news website quoted the sources as saying that some specific groups that have trained medics have kidnapped the children, mutilated their body organs and then left their corpses in remote areas or buried them.</p>
<p>According to them, an Israeli officer in Turkey is waiting for the children’s organs to be transferred to the black market for transplantation.</p>
<p>The sources said that the medical teams of these groups have anesthesiologists, surgeons and a number of armed forces who abduct children and transfer them to safe areas for surgery in brand-new and fully equipped ambulances.</p>
<p>Earlier reports, in November, also said that the children who have been rescued from the camps of Abdullah Muhammad al-Muhaysini, a senior al Qaeda-linked cleric and the religious leader of Jeish al-Fatah terrorist group, are now threatened with the danger of trafficking their body organs by the terrorists.</p>
<p>Local sources in Idlib province told al-Akhbar newspaper that during the past two weeks, 15 people have been kidnapped from different districts, most of them children.</p>
<p>Also, social media activists have released tens of messages and warned the Idlib residents of the possibility of abduction of their children and trafficking of their body organs by the terrorist groups, saying that most of the kidnapped children have been transferred to Turkey.</p>
<p>Local sources in several districts of Idlib have reported that over 10 children have been abducted in different parts of the province, including Kafarouma, Jidar Bekalfoun, Atma, Jisr al-Shaqour and al-Fayqa by the militants.   Also, a local source in Sarmada town North of Idlib said that “a number of militants driving a white van abducted a 10-year-old child but they faced the residents’ resistance and were arrested but sources said that they were freed from Fatah al-Sham (formerly known as al-Nusra) prison the same day”.</p>
<p>According to reports, the exacerbation of security situation in Idlib has forced the residents to flee to Hama province in fear of their children’s lives.   According to the report, the ISIL terrorists set up a medical team in Mosul headed by a German physician which exports the body organs to Syria and the Iraqi Kurdistan region for transplantation to its members or selling.</p>
<p>Iraqi Ambassador to the United Nations Mohamed Alhakim had made the same revelations last year, saying that the ISIL terrorists are trafficking human organs and executed a dozen doctors for failing to go along with the program.</p>
<p>Alhakim based his claim on the discovery of dozens of bodies left in shallow mass graves near the city of Mosul, currently an ISIL terrorists stronghold. Surgical incisions, along with missing kidneys and other body parts lead to an inescapable conclusion. “We have bodies. Come and examine them. It is clear they are missing certain parts,” Alhakim revealed. He further described the carnage:</p>
<p>“When we discover mass graves, we look at the bodies. Some of those bodies are killed by bullets, some of them by knives. But when you find pieces of the back is missing and the kidneys is missing, you will wonder what it is.”</p>
<p>SYRIA, IDLIB, CHILDREN KIDNAPPED FOR ORGAN TRAFFICKING IS THE NEW JIHADI BUSINESS</p>
<p>After archaeological items and oil, Syria’s extremists are getting rich with organ trafficking. Several cases of missing children in the villages of Idlib province have been reported. The children are moved across the border into Turkey. Turkish media had reported the problem in the past before they were censored by Erdogan.</p>

<p>Idlib (AsiaNews) – Organ trafficking involving children from Idlib (northwestern Syria) has become another source of concern like the smuggling of archaeological items, oil and weapons.</p>
<p>According to a number of reports, children have been kidnapped in broad daylight by “unknown” groups able to move around unhindered and unpunished in spite of roadblocks and controls set up by Jaish al-Fatah (Army of Conquest) armed militias.</p>
<p>Families that managed to save their children from forced enrollment by Saudi imam Abdallah Al Muhasni in an around the city of Idlib now live in fear. In fact, the city has recently seen a frightening increase in the number of children abducted or &quot;held&quot; by these unknown groups.  Some 15 children have reportedly gone missing in the past two weeks, one a day, in villages around Idlib like Kafaruma, Jidar Yakfalun, Atme, Jisr el Shughur, and Al Fukayea.</p>
<p>In Kfarbatikh, however, two kidnapping attempts failed thanks to the quick response of residents, alarmed by the cries for help of would-be victims. The kidnappers managed to escape leaving behind their two children. Yasser Mohamad Ibrahim was not so lucky. The 14-year-old fled Mork with his parents to avoid forced conscription by Jihadis only to be kidnapped in El Maarath Naaman in front of his parents\' home in late afternoon yesterday.    Last week another case had a positive outcome. Unknown men forced a little girl into a white van in Sarmada, a village north of Idlib, but in an act of solidarity villagers reacted immediately chasing the vehicle until the nearby village of Al Dana where they freed the 10-year-old and handed the kidnappers over to Jabhat Fateh al-Sham (Front for the Conquest of the Levant), formerly known as the Al-Nusra Front, an al Qaeda affiliate in Syria. </p>
<p>On the same day, a young man in his 30s, Muhamad Kasem Najla, was abducted in Dana, possibly by organ traffickers. Although his kidnappers were captured and jailed, they managed to escape without leaving a trace before they could be questioned or tried.  Children, who in the Middle East tend to play in the streets near their homes, have stopped doing so. Parents and families in Idlib avoid as much as possible letting their children out of the house. Fewer and fewer children are in school or even involved in child labour, once a widespread local practice.   Many families who settled around Idlib to escape the direct grip of extremists are now moving to the city of Hama, considered safer in terms of kidnapping and organ trafficking.</p>
<p>Increasingly, social media warn parents to be vigilant about their children in light of the danger of kidnapping related to organ trafficking, advising them not let their children out of the house or move around them without adults.   According to online activists, kidnapped children are taken to neighbouring Turkey, as in the case of two girls abducted last April in the northern neighbourhoods of Jisr al-Shughur. In another case, two children were taken from the Atma refugee camp, north of Idlib.</p>
<p>Two years ago, Turkish media – when they still enjoyed some freedom of the press – had denounced the presence of &quot;ambulances involved in trafficking of human organs under the disguise of moving wounded people to hospitals in Turkey near the border with Syria”. (PB)</p>
<p>18K SYRIAN CHILDREN HAVE HAD THEIR ORGANS HARVESTED OVER THE LAST 6 YEARS</p>
<p><a href="https://steemit.com/organharvesting/">https://steemit.com/organharvesting/</a>@v4vapid/18-000-syrian-children-have-had-their-organs-harvested-over-the-last-6-years</p>
<p>Reports from the Director-General of the Syrian Coroner\'s Office affirm that thousands of Syrian children have had their organs harvested since 2011.</p>
<p>Turkish refugee camps on the border with Syria are identified as prime locations where organ harvesting has been, and is, occurring. Director-General Hossein Noufel recently made the disclosure though United Nation officials have not officially confirmed the findings.</p>
<p>“We have accurate information that over 25,000 surgical operations have been conducted in the refugee camps of the neighboring countries and in the terrorist-controlled areas in Syria since 2011 to take out the body organs of 18,000 Syrians and sell them in the international black markets.” - Dr. Noufel</p>
<p>Previously, refugees have recounted horror stories about the dire situation inside some of the refugee camps, however the morbid practice is not limited to camps as there are claims organ harvesting is occurring in Urban centers as well.</p>

               really don't know.  We are doing our part posting it on here, and hoping to spread the word.  We cannot take on the world's problems when other's are putting their hands over their ears.  If I start thinking of what to do, I will go mad.  I or you cannot change this by ourselves  We as a group on here have made a difference.  Keep thinking that, or it will drive you mad.  I used to let it upset me so much and now I am still upset but know that one person cannot change this.  We are doing all we can. Talking to friends relatives and neighbors and writing on here is our outlet and our way of making a change.  We can't do it all.  Take comfort in that.  We are doing the best we can. Keep posting.

             I love where your mind goes when thinking of their punishment for their heinous crimes against children.  There is no worse crime than what they have done to them.  We research the Satanic Ritual Abuses and have always thought they were not that prevalent, but here they are, being committed all over the world against Our Children.  I blame our country for we have created much of the conditions and environments that facilitate these horrid abuses against Children and the Poor.  I think of this almost every day.  I don't think there is a punishment too horrid or evil for these Criminals. They have No Morals.  Torture them before they die.  If this does not fall under Tortures then I do not know what does.  We are not allowed to Torture Soldiers, but it is OK to Torture Our Children?  I am getting sick. Tears.

            Nat'l Health Service England: 
The scandal at Alder Hey Children's centres on the retention of hearts and organs from hundreds of children. 
The organs were stripped without permission from babies who died at the hospital between 1988-1996.
           </p>
           <p>
            Have to wonder if the babies' outcome was determined by the value of their harvested organs?

             Oh Yes, my mind has gone there.  I believe this is occurring at many hospitals actually.  The Alder Hey discovery is only the tip of the iceberg again.  There is talk of a database with Our Children's body measurements of all sorts of limbs and bones and other info.  People would be horrified by this and will say it is too impossible to believe, but I am getting the feeling that we had better wake up, because they have been doing this for decades.  Under the Radar has allowed them to develop many ways to have access to Our Children.  I have an idea that the ACA was developed to facilitate this database, mind you, that is only my thinking.   But not impossible to imagine, given their evilness.  I can't believe I am actually saying this. Good Lord Help Us.

            20011-14 Prison sentence
"Levy Izhak Rosenbaum, who ran a black market kidney business paid Israeli donors $10,000 each for kidneys that he sold to Americans for $120,000, has been released from prison."
He gets released from an American prison , did two and a half  years for brokering kidneys.
Despite the conviction, Rosenbaum - an Israeli citizen - will be allowed to remain in the United States and will not be deported. His lawyer Edward Schulman said immigration officials found that his crime was not one of 'moral turpitude.'
'If he was drugging the people or knocking them out' to get their kidneys, Shulman said, that would have been a deportable offense. But, he said, that was not the case. 'Both participants were willing". His Jewish lawyer swears that the donor was "willing".
           </p>
           <p>
            "The real crime hidden between the lines, the recruitment and trafficking of poor and minority Israelis into the United States for the sole purpose of procuring their organs. The US is not party to the 2000 UN Palermo Convention on human trafficking that includes human trafficking for organs. "
           </p>
           <p>
            1999 to 2009: Rosenbaum and his gang, worked through an Israeli boss named “Tevye” (a name that was always whispered) who was the big shot who organized the Israeli patients and matched them to strangers who would pose as altruistic donors. “Tevye” employed kidney hunters, a lower strata of intermediaries, some of them previous sellers themselves, who were paid by the head to troll immigration offices, jails, unemployment offices, factories, Arab markets, and public housing on the urban periphery, looking for the bioavailable — the debtors, the displaced, the desperate and the cognitively disabled. in the case of Durban-Netcare, of trafficking minors as kidney providers.
           </p>
           <p>
            At $140,000 (low) to $180,000 (high) paid for each of 100 transplants (even with lots of people to bribe along the way), that’s a lot of money to launder, at least 150 million dollars, a profitable business for Mr Rosenbaum.
           </p>
           <p>
            Who's to say that Rosenbaum or someone like him based here in the US is not continuing their participation in human organ trafficking but now are cutting out the "volunteer" donor and preying on "bioavailable" war refugees?
           </p>
           <p>
            Rosenbaum, an Orthodox Jewish "rabbi" in name only, is a protected species, allowed to live here and thrive because of Israeli influence in US politics.
Part of the 2009 Rosenbaum bust involved Syrian Jews living in New Jersey who were  members of the international Orthodox Jewish criminal network arrested on July 23, 2009.  This network is deeply involved in illegal narcotics and financial crimes.The main players in this criminal network are among the leading members of the Sephardic Jewish community of Brooklyn, New York City, and Deal, New Jersey.  The tiny Syrian Jewish enclave of Deal, New Jersey (population 1,000) involved when the FBI busted 5 prominent rabbis from this secretive group of Syrian/Israeli Orthodox Jews.
The arrest of the Orthodox rabbis led some to dub the affair "Kosher Nostra."  The rabbis, including two synagogue leaders, are suspected of organizing a money-laundering network that allegedly worked through charities in Deal, Brooklyn and Israel, Ha'aretz reported.  The 15 people arrested on money laundering charges were all Orthodox Jews and/or Israelis, including the "kidney trade middleman," a.k.a. Levi-Yitzhak Rosenbaum. There were so many detainees that a bus was used to transport them.  This massive arrest, however, is seen by many as only the tip of the iceberg.
           </p>
           <p>
            "Non-Jews, "Goyim" or Gentiles, are considered to be even lower and are despised by Orthodox Jews yet they choose to live and carry out their criminal schemes in America, which has a population which is overwhelmingly non-Jewish.
            <br/>
            "WE DON'T WANT GENTILE CHARACTERISTICS"
           </p>
           <p>
            Do I see a connection between Syrian children kidnapped for their organs and Sephardic Syrian Orthodox Jews in Brooklyn and New Jersey involved in human organ trafficking, money laundering and other criminal enterprises? And these Jews despise the nonJew and see no religious conflict in harming non Jews?

             Wow!  Yeah, I remember the NJ Rabbis.  I think NJ has been a Breeding Ground for Crime and Mafia Types from all sides.  We have the involvement with NY and the stealing of bones from people in funeral homes.  The Funeral Owners were selling the bones and one of the bodies sold off was Alistair Cooke.  What caused the discovery was Cooke's daughter who never gave up to find out what happened to her Father's Bones.  I also remember some politician we were investigating there.  He was hooked up to something nefarious with bodies or bones.  Darn it is frustrating when the brain freezes over.  I believe there is a Big Connection going on there. There seems to be some kind of Horrible Crime Syndicate from the Mafia and the Kosher Nostra and Mossad is surely there as well.  I have a feeling somewhere there is connection to some Really Big Names to these people.  Thanks Henny Penny We need to do a post on this guy Rosenbaum.  Or Should we say Rosenbum and the Kosher Nostra.

             Thank you for the ping.  The posts on COT have been great.  It's unthinkable - huge, organized, funded, and covered up.  And this is just what has been written about!

               I doubt that people are ignoring them.  I couldn't read them through to respond except for this one, they were too upsetting  for me.  I haven't gotten over the shock yet of the allegations about the Chicago teenage girls, which I just found out.  My Chicago relatives are near that area.  All my relatives are involved in Pedogate....yet I have to act like everything's normal, or else.   I just need a little time to absorb the new information.  But thank you for bringing attention to COT!

                I am so sorry that your relatives have to be in that area.  Also for their involvement.  I know of your story so I was not suggesting you.  You have always worked hard to spread the injustices and abuse done to Our Children. I have a friend or two there too, but not in that area.  But their hearts break for all the children missing and shot almost every day.  Thank You for responding.

              Yes, they are very disturbing.  We are hoping to spread the word and inform people about how this actually is happening and the ins and outs of their operations.  Some may doubt the organ trafficking exists, we have new people every day.  I have been watching our numbers and we have added on.  Hoping people read our posts bit by bit if it is too hard.  This was not easy for us reading and writing about it.  Thanks for reading and taking the time to comment. &lt;3

            Great post. Heartbreaking. And i dont think syrian groups are the only ones preying on the syrian children. Americas military presence there is highly suspect. Sad.

             Yes, it is all very sad. The saddest part for us, is that our country is  playing a big part in all of it.  We are behind ISIS and what is happening in Syria, all to facilitate Organ Trafficking, while everyone Binge Watches.

               TY and if the truth comes out about Hillary and Bill having connections to  Hashim Thaci and Beiden inviting him to the WH they will be too busy watching their Netflix to even care.  He is being investigated for arms trading and drug and human trafficking and of all things, organ harvesting.  You won't see this on MSM.

             Yes!  ISIS is doing their dirty work for them.  They take the organs of their own fighters, imagine those kids that went off to fight over there.  Never to be heard from again.  Yes, I believe it was all purposely created for longer lives.  Also there are slick operations, with trained medics, and all the necessary equipment, and set up ambulances.  Nothing is too good for them. And what they are doing with the poor people they have ravaged, well that is sickening.  Mass graves, even of children.  It hurts to think of it.
