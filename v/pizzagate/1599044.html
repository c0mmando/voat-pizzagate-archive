            What was milo told, and why did Ben swann do what he did, I think is your Q?
           </p>
           <p>
            Milo gave a hint that (someone) in DC told him to chill they got this and him talking about it isn't as productive as maybe he thought. Now whether milo is real or a mind fuck is still up for debate, but I like the dude.
           </p>
           <p>
            Then you have alex jones...
I think there are two things at play here, I think first that while alex probably provides more truth than any other news source as big, he is probably still controlled, not just by laws but he is maybe even a mind fuck, where you get enough truth that you feel satisfied that you're not being conned... (this is a very popular tactic of "shills" on this very board.. so you're gonna get some truth but oh no no no he shys away from mr johns pizza gate (sorry if there is a mr johns pizza I didn't mean to use a real name that's why I combined two common chains names)
           </p>
           <p>
            Anyways alex tells truth, but limits it...
           </p>
           <p>
            Then again Ben swann probably fucking pisses off people because while he isn't FOXNEWS or CNN, he does have what's considered a mainstream (local) show.. I think with Ben, he is feeling pressure from CBS and he is playing nice. I also feel he has a huge card up his sleeve. Thing is we have to wait and that sucks.
           </p>
           <p>
            But let's remember all we have so far is a ton of disgusting things when considered lead to a very clear picture. We don't have a picture, we just know what picture is being painted. Pizzagate is real, it might not even include ping pongs, or maybe you get a ping pong up your ass when they kill you. Certainly they would..... but we know it's real as far as up in the government. And the pizza comet angle is pretty damn creepy. But really maybe alex jones is (sorta) right the rockstar of the pedo show stuff is creepy but can we stop the world from fucking kids or are we insisting that jimmy comet is the villain we're after. Seriously though as creepy and stupid weird as jimmy comet is, I really think we're more after the big wigs. THAT IS UNLESS we can show that CPP is or was a showcase, or this george Webb claim that it's connected. I am amazed at webb, but the claims he says sometimes it's like wtf how do you know this. And when he connected it, even he mentions comet, but he offers NO PROOF. I get that Webb is amazing, but we can't run with his claims no matter how magical we just have a PowerPoint and some dude pointing at it..
           </p>
           <p>
            I BELIEVE HIM but we still only have his videos (mostly) as proof. So what to do? Fuck man keep fighting. But definitely trust nobody. Be skeptical as fuck, but keep fighting..
           </p>
           <p>
            WE KNOW WHATS UP AT LEAST ENOUGH OF WHATS UP
           </p>
           <p>
            But let's not put overemphasis on things, that we are sure of.
           </p>
           <p>
            The name of the game they're playing is kind fuck and they're good at it.
           </p>
           <p>
            Mind fuck starts with MIND
           </p>
           <p>
            and that's our specialty:
           </p>
           <p>
            Let's leave the fuck off and do as goo as we can. Yes all there milo; alex, and swann have good info, but we can't depend on any one or we're weak. I myself even suspect this forum is as real as we may ever see.. rockstars, armyseers, people hoping to help, and bad guacamole. Even if something happens we will all know probably more of the truth than anyone.
           </p>
           <p>
            We need to focus one the big ring of power.. and pizza is awesome, but maybe not the main ingredient. Creepy as fucking hell but last time I checked it wasn't jimmy comet writing laws..
           </p>
           <p>
            And you know what maybe I'm becoming a shill. I'm sick of focusing on fucking trannies in red hats, I want some politicians to fall. Give a fuck if they have (R) or (D) these slave masters of the world need to fall. And if the dude who makes them pizza (or provides much more services) falls too then so be it... but if we continue to make our focus on one "domino" then we're fucked in this fake world when that domino falls..... I mean shit they would pretend like James is gone, and we would forget...
           </p>
           <p>
            Then 6 years later we would all not even realize he is the new star of this or we elected him for that..
           </p>
           <p>
            Like what I am saying is nobody pays attention past their noses. Let's just take down the grid and if see a comet along the way then we did our job very well.
           </p>
           <p>
            The world is fake guys all of it, but pizzagate is real
           </p>
           <p>
            We seriously need a trusted council or something so we can organize a plan. Like the claim is were up against the CIA and some pizza dude that likes comets.... maybe we should figure out some sort of plan pick some people to take it offline: when the CIA does business they DONT POST IT ON VOAT, and when a owner of a pizza place has ideas for a new recipe he DOESNT POST IT ON VOAT.
           </p>
           <p>
            We need an extremely trusted and easily kicked out of group of people that also talk in private, an organization, a damn secret society if you wanna call it that: use their tactics. I mean fuck man they have the CIA, DNC and probabaly RNC, and half the FBI. Like we should try and be more covert  I guess or maybe have a more covert group of people.
           </p>
           <p>
            Think about it. If we had trusted people and the AMA guy had come the debacle that occurred might have been averted
           </p>
           <p>
            Idk man I'm rambling just ideas FW OUT

            That pizzagate is real ? That the reason that human trafficking is mushrooming and that the whole infrastructure of the trafficking trade is actually government sanctioned at some level ?  That it just makes sense that the scale of the trafficking business must have some high level powerful players ?  That the average joe public must be kept in the dark to allow all this to happen? That what all these so called foundations do is ask for donations from the public to pay for the fat cat salaries and to call compromised hotlines to feed data to the traffickers themselves ?  That tech companies, while pretending to do work against the porn industry, actually support it by allowing them to network and provide routes for the average punter to the dark web? As Clinton said, 'there's a public and then there's a private position'.
           </p>
           <p>
            I'm wondering if anyone has done a report on the human trafficking industries, compiling stats on the money that pours into it from the public and first world countries and compare it to the successes of how many people are actually caught.
