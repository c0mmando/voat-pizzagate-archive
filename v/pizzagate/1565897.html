Turns out on ancestry.com there is only 1 family with the surname Alefantis in the US <a href="http://sli.mg/KAdFup">http://sli.mg/KAdFup</a>, obviously James\'. Although because I\'m not a US resident I couldn\'t look into dates etc, I took the screencap quickly before being redirected to ancestry.co.uk. Nothing on ancestry.co.uk for what it\'s worth.</p>
<p>Secondly I searched for Alefantis on howmanyofme.com and turned up &quot;less than 120&quot; which is the typical response for anything lower than that number, even if it\'s 1 or none. For example I gave /dbafksjbf as a surname and it gave the same response, 120 or lower. Typically the limiting factor of how many people share the same name is the first name but this however was interesting, if you go to <a href="http://howmanyofme.com/info/">http://howmanyofme.com/info/</a> You can see that James is THE most popular first name in the US. So I searched James Alefantis, the result <a href="http://sli.mg/Yi0aBP">http://sli.mg/Yi0aBP</a> is that there are 2 or fewer, which means &quot;we aren\'t confident whether it\'s one or two&quot;. So potentially he is the ONLY James Alefantis in the US.</p>
<p>Back to the French translations. <a href="http://sli.mg/WfqS0h">This</a> was an image shared at <a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1446228">https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1446228</a> by user noskerdycatusa. Very suspicious... Besta Pizza. My girlfriend has fluent French and she says that Baise ta pizza is read as (baysta pizza) and no, it isn\'t a translation of the word fuck as a swear word <a href="http://sli.mg/8rNI3m">http://sli.mg/8rNI3m</a> It literally means to lay, screw or have sex with. 
And for those that need reminding <a href="http://sli.mg/nc0Jev">http://sli.mg/nc0Jev</a> The boy love symbolism at Besta Pizza, where you can screw your pizza. </p>
<p>Back to L\'enfantis or L\'enfant. I read a comment over at <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/The_Donald/comments/5d7yrj/red_alert_james_alefantis_of_comet_pizza_is_an/">/r/T_D</a> I suggest you read it as it is far more detailed <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/The_Donald/comments/5d7yrj/red_alert_james_alefantis_of_comet_pizza_is_an/da2l82p/">https://www.reddit.com/r/The_Donald/comments/5d7yrj/red_alert_james_alefantis_of_comet_pizza_is_an/da2l82p/</a></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The idea is that the urban plan of Washington D.C was originally designed by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L%27Enfant_Plan">Pierre Charles L\'Enfant</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The design included <a href="http://sli.mg/MHxEhv">this</a> layout of roads surrounding Capitol Hill. Seems very owl shaped, no?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="http://sli.mg/pJaTXr">This</a> is the seal of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bohemian_Club">Bohemian Club</a>
Yes the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bohemian_Grove">Bohemian Grove</a> Bohemian Club </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Lilith <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lilith">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lilith</a> Is a semitic demoness. She is directly referenced in the Bible as <em>lilit</em> which translated in Hebrew can mean &quot;Screech Owl&quot;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burney_Relief">This is the Burney Relief plaque</a>. It depicts a winged nude goddess, Lilith, surrounded by owls.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>According to wikipedia... &quot;Two primary characteristics are seen in these legends about Lilith: Lilith as the incarnation of <strong>lust</strong>, <strong>causing men to be led astray</strong>, and Lilith as a <strong>child-killing witch</strong>, who strangles helpless <strong><em>neonates</em></strong>.&quot; 
Definition of &quot;neonates&quot; for those curious is </p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Neonate</strong></p>
<p><em>ˈniːə(ʊ)neɪt/</em></p>
<p><strong><em>noun</em></strong></p>
<p>plural noun: <em>neonates</em></p>
<ul>
<li><em>a newborn child (or other mammal).</em></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Medicine</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><em>an infant less than four weeks old.</em></li>
</ul>
<p>So in conclusion it seems that Washington D.C as a child killing, sacrificial cult was rooted in origin with Pierre Charles L\'Enfant who may or may not be able to be tied to James Alefantis <strong><em>IF</em></strong> <em>that\'s his real name</em>. And with French ties. Including Besta Pizza being translated to screw your pizza. It\'s very late and I\'m very tired so I apologise for any errors or mistakes or even presentation.

           Okay so I'm sure we've all seen this about James Alefantis' name before
           <a href="http://sli.mg/sfZ15W">
            http://sli.mg/sfZ15W

           but I dug a little deeper into it. Turns out on ancestry.com there is only 1 family with the surname Alefantis in the US
           <a href="http://sli.mg/KAdFup">
            http://sli.mg/KAdFup

           , obviously James'. Although because I'm not a US resident I couldn't look into dates etc, I took the screencap quickly before being redirected to ancestry.co.uk. Nothing on ancestry.co.uk for what it's worth.
          </p>
          <p>
           Secondly I searched for Alefantis on howmanyofme.com and turned up "less than 120" which is the typical response for anything lower than that number, even if it's 1 or none. For example I gave /dbafksjbf as a surname and it gave the same response, 120 or lower. Typically the limiting factor of how many people share the same name is the first name but this however was interesting, if you go to

            http://howmanyofme.com/info/
           </a>
           You can see that James is THE most popular first name in the US. So I searched James Alefantis, the result
           <a href="http://sli.mg/Yi0aBP">
            http://sli.mg/Yi0aBP
           </a>
           is that there are 2 or fewer, which means "we aren't confident whether it's one or two". So potentially he is the ONLY James Alefantis in the US.

            The thing about the Besta Pizza name is...say it with an accent like Mario from the Mario Brothers games ("It's-a me! Mario!"). I think it's named in a manner that is supposed to suggest that the name of the place is "Best Pizza" but pronounced in a stereotypical "Italian speaking broken-ish English" fashion, making it "Besta Pizza".
           </p>
           <p>
            As far as the layout of the streets of D.C. and the Bohemian Grove connection - it's all connected to "goddess" worship (in our case as Americans, it would be our "goddess"
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Columbia_(name)">
             Columbia
            </a>
            - who our Capital city belongs to). The "goddess" figure is often presented with owls, seemingly in association with the gnostic "Sophia", the goddess of wisdom (owls being often anthropomorphized as wise). The archons, the entities that create the false reality in front of us (think the machines that create the Matrix - which is actually based completely on gnosticism), are often portrayed as spiders. Hence the Bohemian Grove slogan "Weaving spiders come not here". Supposedly it speaks to leaving politics and business at the gates during the retreat, but that obviously isn't going to happen. They are at the Grove to engage in odd rituals involving goddess worship. To what ends, I don't know.

            Any news on what Alefantis' original name was?
Two comments --
In looking at Hillary's ancestry recently, she is distantly related to Pierre L'Enfant -- 
cousin, seven times removed (If I recall correctly)
And, that is, if researchers didn't get one of her grandparents wrong -- Jones, I think (grandmother) which would 
make 1/4 of her ancestry wrong!

            AND -- 
**Re Lilith --
**Keep in mind that the Old Testament was written to cement patriarchy.
And was one of the teachings which "Jesus" was in rebellion against. 
There are some topics on Wiki which cover Lilith as Adam's first wife --
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             Lilith 
Representations of Lilith and the Evolution of a Mythical Heroine".  Of Adam's first wife, Lilith, it is told (The witch he loved before the gift of Eve,)
            </p>
            <p>
             Lilith (magazine) 
named after Lilith, a character said to be Adam's first wife. Though not mentioned in the Bible, Talmudic scholars later wrote that Lilith was banished
            </p>
            <p>
             Lilith was Adam's first wife -- "banished" -- she didn't suit Adam because she understood that she had been
created in the same way and that she was Adam's equal.
Typically, you really have to did to find out anything about her -- and she is demonized in every way possible.
She does however become a friend to Eve who has her own problems with Adam -- and helps her.
            </p>
           </blockquote>
           <p>
            Organized patriarchal religion -- male-supremacist religion -- is all about its enemies -- especially women!
And it underpins patriarchy.
Males are superior because their "god" says so!
           </p>
           <p>
            Pizzagate related as the primary sickness of "Satan" and "Satanism" is the invention or organized patriarchal
religion based in their own fears and paranoia projected onto others.

            OP you made a sad mistake by associating the honourable "Dbafksjbf" family to this sewer here. Be cursed for that!
           </p>
           <p>
            "Baise ta pizza" roughly stands (the only difference is that "s" must be then pronounced as "z")
           </p>
           <p>
            Joke aside (?) the owner of Besta is from Guinea Conacry isn't he? French is the officiel language there.

            For the record, there is one ping-pong bar in Paris and I found nothing suspect about it (it stands near a hospital which shelters several structures for helping social cases, drug addicts... including pregnant ladies or youg mothers though). The name of the ping-pong bar is "Gossali" which happens to be that of one of the men who invented the Ping-Pong game. You may phonetically split it in "Gosse Sali" that could translate as "Sullied kid".
           </p>
           <p>
            But there really doesn't seem to be anything suspicious about the bar. It is just for the record.
           </p>
           <p>
            Like phonetical ressemblances don't say much in the end.

            Don't forget -- JA has a pedophile icon sculpture as his instagram avatar AND willingly and joyfully accepts being referred to as Pan, who leads children to slaughter with a flute.
           </p>
           <p>
            Looking at JA in a vacuum with one strange thing at a time is negligible. But this dude has a fact pattern like a champ.

            I'm french so I like the translation for Besta Pizza although I also like the Portugese translation to beast.  If you go for a litteral translation of Alefantis you'd have to change a few letters like this:
           </p>
           <p>
            James Alefantis would be
JAmes À l'efantis so then add an i to James and remove the A, add an n to efantis and remove the is.
           </p>
           <p>
            J'aime l'enfant (I love the child)
           </p>
           <p>
            It sounds complicated but there are too many changes to make a direct translation.  I think that if he changed his name then he was going for a phonetic resemblance.  So why would someone chamge his name just for a phonetic RESEMBLANCE and not the real deal?
           </p>
           <p>
            I think there is a deeper hidden secret to his name, if it's not his real one.

             I think some one worked out if you translate the name to Greek, then to French the translations a little more accurate. I'm not a linguistic person, so not tried.

            JA was using that name in college. He apparently was a typical frat boy idiot back then, which is only strange in so much as he was actually gay and most frats (especially 25 years ago) wouldn't be a safe haven for gay college dudes. So somehow this idiot who couldn't even manage to party in college without getting caught, is now listed as the 49th most powerful person in DC? That's the part that is more interesting to me. His "success" wreaks of "connections". I think it's much more informative to figure out how he became a cog in this wheel in the first place. He was either "connected" from the beginning (think familial type connections) or he was involved in a relationship of some kind that facilitated his success/connections. Meaning, he was found to be a useful idiot to someone in power.

             For many, frats are an introduction to networking and secret societies. "Rituals" are commonplace in the big frats.

            This is brainless lunacy. The correspondence between JA and the French for I love children is minor and purely coincidental, same with Pierre L'Enfant architect of DC. If Trump really did tweet that . . . what an irony that the completely erroneous 'fact' will be what gets the story out to the general public . . . or will it just be used to show what an idiot he is?

            My one thought on the name thing is that James got caught with a fake ID in college and had property handed to him under aliases. So I think there is a precedent for misinformation and misleading with his name, probably intentionally, saying pretty far back. Thanks for posting some ideas!

              when did he get into this? Well, given his avatar is of a 13 yr old lover of an Emperor, I'm guessing he was visited in his schooldays by a past president who gave him a depraved re-education.
Understand, 'Antinous' is not an object of his desire, its someone he IDENTIFIES with

            The Alefantis/ I love children connection is not so wild considering the picture of the guy in the "J (heart) L'enfant" t-shirt of the instagram.
           </p>
           <p>
            I'm extremely interested to find out too that the guy who did the layout for Washington DC was named L'enfant.  Vewy Intwesting.

             L'enfant is the name of a cafe nearby IIRC. Still a very strange thing to name your cafe. And then VERY strange to make shirts with J'aime L'enfant on them....

              Not if you live in Washington it's not.   L'enfant is the name of a plaza, a hotel near that plaza, a metro subway stop, etc.

                  The implicants are you don't speak French.  L'enfant translates to "the child."  bébé is infant.

                 <p>
                  I don't speak French either, but a lot of folk on here have dismissed the idea that the T-shirt or  JA's names would mean I like children to a French speaker.

                    No.  My point was neither of the things you suggest are the french translation is the french translation.
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    It's only disturbing if you don't speak french and think that is how you say I love kids or I love children in French, because it's not.

                     It's still weird. These people know exactly what they're doing. Even if it's not a perfect translation ( I actually do speak French by the way so your assumptions were wrong) the implication is still there.

              I don't think our founders who were American Masons were satanic. Masonry became unpopular in the 1830s and then around the Civil War period the evil Confederate officer, Albert Pike, who still has a statue in DC, I think, revived an evil version of the Masons in cahoots with the P2 Lodge of Italy, which latter became the Mafia or something. Pike was connected with the KKK, which was originally called the Knights of the Golden Circle (Ku Klux is Greek for circle or something) and raised many thousands of southern rebels against the Union. I guess that's a little ironic, since we're talking about different forms of slavery here.

               The Masons that I see going into the Masonic lodge don't really look like Satanists either. But I think the group's organization is such that the lower levels don't know what goes on at the upper levels. Weren't the Rothschilds involved in funding the American Revolution? That says it all about that.
              </p>
              <p>
               Witchcraft has a history that goes back a long time, so Satanism wasn't exactly something that was foreign in those times. I also think pedophilia has probably been passed from generation to generation in certain families going back who knows how far. It might even be something that's always been a dirty secret with Man from the beginning.

                European royalty and some Jewish elites, like Rothschilds, do seem to have long-time pagan/satanic traditions. Maybe the Mafia did too. But Rothschild/s didn't fund the American Revolution. They deposited money in the U.S. First National Bank 30 or 40 years after the Revolution. Some branches of Masons may have been pagan, but the first American Masons don't seem to have been pagan.That started with Pike's bunch in the 1850s or later.

                 It's a another very deep rabbit hole. Connected to pizzagate loosely as a matter of fact  I'm surprised you haven't heard about Denver international airport and the underground city....there hasn't been any official releases but, it's kinda obvious if you study the construction there. Just Google "Denver backup capitol"

               I could not agree more. I wish someone would burn down and tear apart that bohemian grove too. Anything that celebrate human murder and orgies and anyone who participates in such things should be eliminated. It has no place in our society. These people contribute nothing and are only parasites. Good riddance!

            All this is reeeeeeeeeeally reaching, and some is downright misinformation.  The James Alefantis = J'aime L'enfants stuff is nonsense.  Alefantis is his family name.  And your link doesn't prove there's only one Alefantis family in the U.S.  It only shows that particular website only has records for one Alefantis family.  Capitol Hill definitely has an "owl" layout, but connecting that to Lilith is a stretch.  Changing Besta to "Baise Ta" is pretty arbitrary.  Why not just go with the Portuguese translation ("beast")?
