            Very soon you become a much stronger person for seeing the dark underbelly of our society and the world we live in. I was depressed for two weeks and experienced existential nihilism. But i soon bounce back and feel reinvigorated knowing we must fight against corruption, pedophilia and all that nastiness of the elite.

            Well said, I believe supporting each other is key.  What happened on reddit when we almost hit 30k ppl? Magically the thread gets deleted.  What happens on Twitter and youtube? Videos go censored or shadow banned. What's happening in the media? Awful non investigative journalism calling this fake.  This is definitely worthy of an investigation.  We just need to stick together and keep researching.

            THANK YOU.This has totally transformed my world outlook and derailed my sense of wellbeing. I always believed in the Illuminati (or whatever they identify themselves as, in their various factions), but I always thought pedophilia was an incidental abberation. I now understand the role pedophilia plays in being the pinnacle of depravity.
We all understand the mafia triangle: Power/Loyalty/Culpability - when someone witnesses you engaging in crime, they have power over you, and this ensures your loyalty.
I never understood until now that the ultimate possible act of depravity on this planet, by its perverse logic, provides the ultimate leverage over the perpetrator. When you SEE this triangle of Depravity/Loyalty/Power we understand it to be the  purpose and symbolism of the illuminati triangle.
           </p>

            I will never be the same again and have had to debrief
