            This Bachi Boy business is almost beyond belief.

            The sane mind reels, we must insist on disbelief.  Nothing like that could be common place and acceptable in any present day society, no?  Certainly not one where the tribal chieftains our military rely on, are both the prime perpetrators and our most essential local friends. They are said to be, the only power in tribal societies like Afghanistan.   These boys are expensive to feed and train for years at a time, they bring a good price in their prime.  These same societies kill homosexuals.  Go figure.

            It's no good that our troops must experience this and keep silent.  That sort of shit follows you home.

            I'm surpised this news came up. The Gay Lobby fought hard (remember " Repeal Don't ask don't tell" to remove this law from the US Military code of justice to make it legal for US Marines in Afganistan to sodomize a goat.
           </p>
           <p>
            And since then the gay lobby was caught pushing for more laws to make having sex with dogs etc legal. I have come face to face with a gay dog on child sex loving pedophile police officer Christopher Kent Bowersox. Here's the proof of those claims.

            According to this link:

            , the National Defense Authorization Act includes the removal of Article 125 from the UCMJ. As of December.1.2011, Senate approved the NDAA (93-7 votes). As long as President Obama does not veto the act, LGBT service members will be free to their own will without NJP/Discharge worries.

             “Well, whether it was inadvertent or not, they have also taken out the provision against bestiality,” he said. “So now, under the Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ), there’s nothing there to prosecute bestiality."
Former Army Col. Bob Maginnis said some military lawyers have indicated that bestiality may be prosecutable under another section of the &gt;military code of justice – the “catch-all” Article 134 for offenses against “good military order and discipline.”
            </p>
            <p>
             But don't count on that, he said.
“If we have a soldier who engages in sodomy with an animal – whether a government animal or a non-government animal – is it, in fact, a chargeable offense under the Uniform Code? I think that’s in question,” Maginnis told CNSNews.com.

            Whist investigating the case law confirmed pedophile and screaming russian infant sex normalization activist Garry Richard Burns i came across one of his friends was a freind/deciple of a gay Catholic priest who chained himself to the whitehouse gates to make Sodomy with animals legal in the US Military. I found that odd because he was the first person on the internet to point the finger at Cartinal Pell being a pedophile.
