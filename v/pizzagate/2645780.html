<p>ITNJ Witness Statement
My name is Fiona Barnett. I was born Fiona Rae Holowczak, on 28 October 1969, in Sydney, Australia. I am a victim of CIA child trafficking, Luciferian ritual abuse, and Project MK-ULTRA. 
Child trafficking is run as a single integrated world operation. This operation is coordinated by the CIA in collaboration with British and Australian intelligence services. Retired NYPD Detective James Rothstein was appointed to the first US taskforce to investigate this child trafficking operation which, he found, went all the way up to the Whitehouse. Detective Rothstein found that the CIA were behind a blackmail operation in which child prostitutes were used to honeytrap and compromise politicians, military brass, top businessmen, and key government officials. Rothstein, who arrested the key Watergate perpetrator, said Watergate solely concerned this human compromise racket, and specifically was an attempt to obtain a list of compromised pedophile VIPs and their proclivities that was held at the Democratic National Headquarters. I spoke with Rothstein who said he knew of an identical VIP pedophile ring that existed here in Australia, and that an Australian intelligence officer named Peter Osborne knew the details of this.
The Australian wing of this child trafficking operation is coordinated by ASIO (Australian Security Intelligence Organisation). During the 1970s and 80s, Labour Party politician Kim Beazley Snr headed ASIO’s child trafficking operation. Under Kim Beazley’s administration, I was prostituted, at age 6 years, to a pedophile orgy at Parliament House in Canberra, where I was raped by then Prime Minister Gough Whitlam, Attorney-General Lionel Murphy, and Governor-General John Kerr. During this same excursion, future Prime Minister Bob Hawke raped me in a suburban backyard near Canberra, and former President Richard Nixon raped me in the back of a US / CIA military plane at Australia’s main military airport where Airforce One lands when it visits Australia.
After this, I was child sex trafficked from Sydney airport to California, USA, in a cargo plane. I was gassed and stuffed in a wooden crate like an animal. During this trip, I was raped by media founder Ted Turner at a pedophile party held at Disneyland, and I was trafficked to the annual summer camp at Bohemian Grove attended by notable politicians, businessmen and other VIPs. I was raped by Reverend Billy Graham in a pink bubble themed cabin at Bohemian Grove. Billy Graham told me his good buddy Richard Nixon had recommended me to him. At Bohemian Grove, I was one of a group of children dressed as teddy bears and hunted for sport by men in the forest, to the theme song Teddy Bears Picnic. I also witnessed the ritual murder of a woman by male guests dressed in black Luciferian robes.
I will now lay the foundations for explaining the relationship between pedophilia, child trafficking, ritual abuse, mind control practises, and the CIA’s Project MK-ULTRA.<br />
I was handed over to the CIA child trafficking network by my paternal grandparents, Helen and Peter Holowczak, who resided at 14 McAlister Ave, Engadine, a suburb located in the Sutherland Shire, south of Sydney. I was 15 years old when our family discovered that Peter Holowczak was not my blood relative. This news was well-received, since Peter Holowczak was a sadistic pedophile who violently abused me from my earliest memory. Peter Holowczak also abused my father and my brothers. My father, who has complex PTSD and DID, once told my relatives: “Everything Fiona says about the Satanists is true, but we just don’t tell her, for her own good.”
Peter and Helen Holowczak were amongst the large number of Slavic Nazi war criminals granted asylum by the Australian government through the International Refugee Organisation. 
The wave of Slavic Nazis offered asylum in Australia was documented in Mark Aaron’s book War Criminals Welcome: Australia, a Sanctuary for War Criminals Since 1945.  During a 2001 episode of the television show Lateline, Aaron explained:
Most of the war criminals who settled in Australia were not Germans or Austrians.  They were people from Central and Eastern Europe, from the Ukraine, the Baltic States, the central European countries of Czechoslovakia, Croatia and Serbia… These people had done deals with western intelligence organisations, having given them intelligence were then secreted or allowed to go to third countries like Australia… 
The Simon Wiesenthal Centre has a classification system whereby they rate (from A to F) how cooperative a country is with the process of locating, investigating and trying Nazi war criminals. Australia is ranked F - the least cooperative.<br />
Numerous Nazi war criminals settled in an area south of Sydney which ran from the Sutherland Shire to Wollongong. These people worked and orgied together, just as they had done back in Nazi Europe. They carried Slavic, Germanic, or Anglicised versions of their former, surnames. 
The Holowczak’s sought refuge from retaliation from the Allies for their collaboration with the Nazis. From when I was 6 years old, Peter Holowczak bragged to me about killing Jews for a living in the Nazi death camp located in Lublin, Poland. Helen was pursued by the Russians for her role in the Gestapo. Her father spent two years in a Siberian work camp for refusing to disclose her whereabouts to the Russians.
Polish people tend to name things after literal life events. The Holowczaks named their Australian house ‘Lublin’ and painted this title in folk art on a sign hung at the front entrance of their Engadine home. Peter named his Doberman dog ‘Satan’ and trained him to hunt and rape children. Helen, who regularly attended orgies with her Slavic refugee community, had three sons to three different men, none of whom were Peter Holowczak. Helen almost named her youngest son ‘Romance’ until an Aussie neighbour told her we don’t do that sort of thing in Australia.
Peter obtained his Doberman dog from another Slavic Nazi war criminal who was granted asylum in Australia. This man supplied dogs to the NSW Police force. He was also involved in the clean up and disposal of bodies following Luciferian ritual crimes.
What people must appreciate is that the Nazis were Luciferians. During their height of power, the Nazis conducted Luciferian rituals in broad daylight in the streets of Germany. Luciferianism is a secret, multi-generational religion with its roots in ancient Babylon and Egypt. Luciferians worship various ancient pagan gods including Lucifer, Molech, Baal, Dagon, Imhotep, Horus, Isis, Anubis, and Seth. 
Nazism drew out and promoted those Slavics who secretly practised Luciferianism. My grandparents and the other Slavic war criminals who were granted asylum in Australia, congregated to covertly practise their brand of Nazi Luciferianism here in Australia. Over time, the descendants of these Luciferian pedophile refugees collaborated with existing Luciferian dynasties such as the Kidmans, Conlons, Overtons, Huxleys, Cardens, and Cumpstons, and infiltrated Australian government and influenced law and policy. 
This explains why right is being confused with wrong, why the government bodies support the perpetrator instead of the victim of crime, and why our legislation is increasingly reflecting Luciferian pedophile doctrine. This explains, for prime example, why the Australian Human Rights Commission recently defended a pedophile who lied on his job application about his conviction and fined the employee for refusing to hire the pedophile. The president of the AHRC, who made that decision, is one of my Luciferian pedophile rapists.
Leonas Petrauskas was a close associate of my Lithuanian grandmother Helen Holowczak. Like the Holowczaks, Petrauskas was granted asylum through the International Refugee Organisation. In fact, the IRO employed him as a medic for a period in Europe. Petrauskas was educated in a Jesuit school. The Jesuits are Luciferians who practise ritual murder and child rape. An increasing number of Australian politicians who hold power are Jesuits.
Owing to his Jesuit training, Leonas Petrauskas assumed the role of head Luciferian priest within the Sutherland Shire Catholic diocese. Roman Catholicism stems from Mithraism, the ancient Luciferian cult in which male priests were married to boy brides (alter boys), and temple prostitutes (nuns) bore children to the priests for ritual murder on key ritual dates. The Latin mass is a whitewashed version of the high Luciferian black mass in which a new-born baby is ritually murdered, and its blood and flesh eaten. This is the ritual that occurred at Bathurst City Hall in 1985, presided over by the AHRC President.</p>',

            She is telling the truth.
One consequence of this conditioning is supernatural levels of memory.
Both Cathy O'Brien and Mike Vreeland were considered 'data mules' whereby simply hearing or reading one time extensive, complex information could be perfectly recalled.
This above, very detailed recounting is exactly what normies would be skeptical about, but is simply one aspect of the 'super soldier' concept.
Additional note, a Belgian woman - cannot locate the name - testified in that International Court proceedings a few years back, that she, also, was taken to Holsworthy.
These cannot be simple coincidences.

              Yes, thanks for posting Ms.Nijenhuis' name.
Reading her horrific story should further validate Ms. Barnett's information as they are near identical histories occurring on different parts of the globe.
Brice Taylor also relates the same information.
As we all can access this data, a clearer picture is emerging that may dispel the understandable "unbelievable" nature of these stories.
The powerful psychological component of NOT wanting this to be true should not be underestimated in the normie world.

            Hey 21. Thanks for sharing Fiona's testimony. I'm going to flair this "Unconfirmed", since it's only a personal testimony statement with no corroborating links. We need to not forget the possibility we're being played here. There a lot of names named here, though, which makes it fertile grounds for further research.

             This posting is an excellent prompting for everyone to take 10 minutes and read DC Hammond's famous 1992 "Greenbaum Speech".
Absent specific names, it corroborates 100% what Ms. Barnett has stated.

              It's in line with the Greenbaum Speech..that's not the same as corroboration though.  I'm not saying what she's saying is not true - i have no opinion on that matter - just pointing out the difference.  Interestingly, I recently made a comment referencing that speech :

            Would this explain why there are so many pedophiles operating globally? There are Nazi-MK Ultra cells planted globally? receiving assistance from colluding police, politicians, judges in an interlinked web?
           </p>
           <p>
            For example:
Norway's CPS seems to favor pedophiles to the point of ignoring FBI warnings for 3 years on a CPS child psychiatrist who downloaded child porn. They even let him keep his surrogate toddlers even though he admitted being a pedophile!
            <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/v/pizzagate/2643068">
             https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/2643068
            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            For a small country of 5 million they seem to have a lot of pedophile activity:
           </p>
           <p>
            2016 Operation Darkroom netted 150 terabytes of data (for context to quote Abel Danger " the Library of Congress holds about 600 terabytes of Web data. Its online archive grows at a rate of about 5 terabytes per month."
            <a href="http://www.starshipearththebigpicture.com/tag/operation-darkroom/">
             http://www.starshipearththebigpicture.com/tag/operation-darkroom/
            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            .Hilde Reikrås, one of the leaders of the Dark Room operation, told Norwegian Broadcasting (NRK) that she’s most surprised by the sheer extent of the pedophile networks police have exposed after a 16-month investigation that’s ongoing. “And the complexity,” she said, after investigators have uncovered around 5,000 user accounts
            <a href="http://www.newsinenglish.no/2016/11/22/probe-into-pedophile-networks-expands/">
             http://www.newsinenglish.no/2016/11/22/probe-into-pedophile-networks-expands/
            </a>
            And this is after the Norwegian police busted a pedo ring in same area 2010. ttps://www.tnp.no/norway/panorama/2145-bergen-police-revealed-global-pedophile-network
           </p>
           <p>
            This is a country that gave the Clinton Foundation Health Access 25million dollars one year
            <a href="http://www.americatalks.com/politics/clinton-implicated-in-norway-pedo-ring/">
             http://www.americatalks.com/politics/clinton-implicated-in-norway-pedo-ring/
            </a>
            <br/>
            yet 
" Police in Norway currently lack a centralized computer system which is able to reveal similarities between individual cases " which allowed one pedophile , the "Pocket Man" to operate undetected for over 30 years!
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erik_Andersen_">
             https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erik_Andersen_
            </a>
            (child_molester)
           </p>
           <p>
            The police catch these criminals but often they take off for foreign countries before their prison term is up:
            <a href="http://norwaytoday.info/news/convicted-norwegian-pedophile-arrested-police-thailand/">
             http://norwaytoday.info/news/convicted-norwegian-pedophile-arrested-police-thailand/
            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            It smells like world wide collusion to increase the number of pedophiles globally. They're not getting eradicated, they're propagating. I don't think we won WWII because the US imported so many Nazi war criminals and now we're seeing the end result: brutality and manipulation wielded by well funded "scientists" and  politicians.
           </p>
           <p>
            Bill Clinton was a William Fullbright protégé and Ms. Barnett's mention of Fullbright is significant.
Thank you for passing this along.

            ITNJ Witness Statement
My name is Fiona Barnett. I was born Fiona Rae Holowczak, on 28 October 1969, in Sydney, Australia. I am a victim of CIA child trafficking, Luciferian ritual abuse, and Project MK-ULTRA.
Child trafficking is run as a single integrated world operation. This operation is coordinated by the CIA in collaboration with British and Australian intelligence services. Retired NYPD Detective James Rothstein was appointed to the first US taskforce to investigate this child trafficking operation which, he found, went all the way up to the Whitehouse. Detective Rothstein found that the CIA were behind a blackmail operation in which child prostitutes were used to honeytrap and compromise politicians, military brass, top businessmen, and key government officials. Rothstein, who arrested the key Watergate perpetrator, said Watergate solely concerned this human compromise racket, and specifically was an attempt to obtain a list of compromised pedophile VIPs and their proclivities that was held at the Democratic National Headquarters. I spoke with Rothstein who said he knew of an identical VIP pedophile ring that existed here in Australia, and that an Australian intelligence officer named Peter Osborne knew the details of this.
The Australian wing of this child trafficking operation is coordinated by ASIO (Australian Security Intelligence Organisation). During the 1970s and 80s, Labour Party politician Kim Beazley Snr headed ASIO’s child trafficking operation. Under Kim Beazley’s administration, I was prostituted, at age 6 years, to a pedophile orgy at Parliament House in Canberra, where I was raped by then Prime Minister Gough Whitlam, Attorney-General Lionel Murphy, and Governor-General John Kerr. During this same excursion, future Prime Minister Bob Hawke raped me in a suburban backyard near Canberra, and former President Richard Nixon raped me in the back of a US / CIA military plane at Australia’s main military airport where Airforce One lands when it visits Australia.
After this, I was child sex trafficked from Sydney airport to California, USA, in a cargo plane. I was gassed and stuffed in a wooden crate like an animal. During this trip, I was raped by media founder Ted Turner at a pedophile party held at Disneyland, and I was trafficked to the annual summer camp at Bohemian Grove attended by notable politicians, businessmen and other VIPs. I was raped by Reverend Billy Graham in a pink bubble themed cabin at Bohemian Grove. Billy Graham told me his good buddy Richard Nixon had recommended me to him. At Bohemian Grove, I was one of a group of children dressed as teddy bears and hunted for sport by men in the forest, to the theme song Teddy Bears Picnic. I also witnessed the ritual murder of a woman by male guests dressed in black Luciferian robes.
I will now lay the foundations for explaining the relationship between pedophilia, child trafficking, ritual abuse, mind control practises, and the CIA’s Project MK-ULTRA.
I was handed over to the CIA child trafficking network by my paternal grandparents, Helen and Peter Holowczak, who resided at 14 McAlister Ave, Engadine, a suburb located in the Sutherland Shire, south of Sydney. I was 15 years old when our family discovered that Peter Holowczak was not my blood relative. This news was well-received, since Peter Holowczak was a sadistic pedophile who violently abused me from my earliest memory. Peter Holowczak also abused my father and my brothers. My father, who has complex PTSD and DID, once told my relatives: “Everything Fiona says about the Satanists is true, but we just don’t tell her, for her own good.”
Peter and Helen Holowczak were amongst the large number of Slavic Nazi war criminals granted asylum by the Australian government through the International Refugee Organisation.
The wave of Slavic Nazis offered asylum in Australia was documented in Mark Aaron’s book War Criminals Welcome: Australia, a Sanctuary for War Criminals Since 1945. During a 2001 episode of the television show Lateline, Aaron explained:
Most of the war criminals who settled in Australia were not Germans or Austrians. They were people from Central and Eastern Europe, from the Ukraine, the Baltic States, the central European countries of Czechoslovakia, Croatia and Serbia… These people had done deals with western intelligence organisations, having given them intelligence were then secreted or allowed to go to third countries like Australia…
The Simon Wiesenthal Centre has a classification system whereby they rate (from A to F) how cooperative a country is with the process of locating, investigating and trying Nazi war criminals. Australia is ranked F - the least cooperative.
Numerous Nazi war criminals settled in an area south of Sydney which ran from the Sutherland Shire to Wollongong. These people worked and orgied together, just as they had done back in Nazi Europe. They carried Slavic, Germanic, or Anglicised versions of their former, surnames.

             The Holowczak’s sought refuge from retaliation from the Allies for their collaboration with the Nazis. From when I was 6 years old, Peter Holowczak bragged to me about killing Jews for a living in the Nazi death camp located in Lublin, Poland. Helen was pursued by the Russians for her role in the Gestapo. Her father spent two years in a Siberian work camp for refusing to disclose her whereabouts to the Russians.
Polish people tend to name things after literal life events. The Holowczaks named their Australian house ‘Lublin’ and painted this title in folk art on a sign hung at the front entrance of their Engadine home. Peter named his Doberman dog ‘Satan’ and trained him to hunt and rape children. Helen, who regularly attended orgies with her Slavic refugee community, had three sons to three different men, none of whom were Peter Holowczak. Helen almost named her youngest son ‘Romance’ until an Aussie neighbour told her we don’t do that sort of thing in Australia.
Peter obtained his Doberman dog from another Slavic Nazi war criminal who was granted asylum in Australia. This man supplied dogs to the NSW Police force. He was also involved in the clean up and disposal of bodies following Luciferian ritual crimes.
What people must appreciate is that the Nazis were Luciferians. During their height of power, the Nazis conducted Luciferian rituals in broad daylight in the streets of Germany. Luciferianism is a secret, multi-generational religion with its roots in ancient Babylon and Egypt. Luciferians worship various ancient pagan gods including Lucifer, Molech, Baal, Dagon, Imhotep, Horus, Isis, Anubis, and Seth.
Nazism drew out and promoted those Slavics who secretly practised Luciferianism. My grandparents and the other Slavic war criminals who were granted asylum in Australia, congregated to covertly practise their brand of Nazi Luciferianism here in Australia. Over time, the descendants of these Luciferian pedophile refugees collaborated with existing Luciferian dynasties such as the Kidmans, Conlons, Overtons, Huxleys, Cardens, and Cumpstons, and infiltrated Australian government and influenced law and policy.
This explains why right is being confused with wrong, why the government bodies support the perpetrator instead of the victim of crime, and why our legislation is increasingly reflecting Luciferian pedophile doctrine. This explains, for prime example, why the Australian Human Rights Commission recently defended a pedophile who lied on his job application about his conviction and fined the employee for refusing to hire the pedophile. The president of the AHRC, who made that decision, is one of my Luciferian pedophile rapists.
Leonas Petrauskas was a close associate of my Lithuanian grandmother Helen Holowczak. Like the Holowczaks, Petrauskas was granted asylum through the International Refugee Organisation. In fact, the IRO employed him as a medic for a period in Europe. Petrauskas was educated in a Jesuit school. The Jesuits are Luciferians who practise ritual murder and child rape. An increasing number of Australian politicians who hold power are Jesuits.
Owing to his Jesuit training, Leonas Petrauskas assumed the role of head Luciferian priest within the Sutherland Shire Catholic diocese. Roman Catholicism stems from Mithraism, the ancient Luciferian cult in which male priests were married to boy brides (alter boys), and temple prostitutes (nuns) bore children to the priests for ritual murder on key ritual dates. The Latin mass is a whitewashed version of the high Luciferian black mass in which a new-born baby is ritually murdered, and its blood and flesh eaten. This is the ritual that occurred at Bathurst City Hall in 1985, presided over by the AHRC President.
Most of my perpetrators were raised Catholic, and many associated with the Catholic colleges located at Sydney University, particularly Patricia Ann Conlon who lived at Sancta Sophia College at Sydney University. Patricia Ann Conlon (nee Carden) was the Grande Dame of the Sydney area.
As Jesuit high priest, Leonas Petrauskas presided over Luciferian rituals committed in the following Catholic Churches:
Regina Coli Church, Beverly Hills, Sutherland Shire (which was gifted by, and closely associated with, the US military),
BoysTown chapels located at Engadine, Sutherland Shire,
St John Bosco church located opposite Engadine BoysTown
Other key Catholic sites of Luciferian ritual were:
St James chapel located on Sydney University campus,
St Mary’s Cathedral, Sydney City.
Luciferianism is arranged according to a hierarchical structure which vaguely resembles a caste system. At the very top sit 13 family dynasties including the Rothschilds and the British Royal Family. These are recognised by the cult as demi-gods. Below these sit approximately 300 Luciferian bloodlines who are generally high IQ, although this tends to have been watered down in some families due to intermarriage. Below this group sit the commoners who can never attain higher status because they lack the desired bloodline. These are your random covens based on nationality (e.g., there’s a strong Scottish coven in Bundaberg), sexual orientation (e.g., Bond University has a lesbian coven), gang membership (bikie gangs), or self-styled, whatever goes these days. It is from these lines that the cult obtains ‘breeders’ - women who are forced to breed unregistered babies for sacrifice and sex trafficking. We refer to these bottom feeders as ‘coven scum’. Their behaviour is usually barbaric and requires constant management to stop them exposing the cult, and they show no respect for those in the caste above them. There is much jealousy and animosity directed by these lower members toward the blood-liners.
I stem from one of the 300 bloodlines via my biological paternal grandparents - not the Holowczaks who had the IQ of a toilet block and so resented my heritage and status within the cult. I question whether Helen Holowczak is my biological grandmother, and whether she used my father as just another prop to escape Europe. Helen lied to the European immigration authorities by saying Peter Holowczak was her husband and the father of my father. Peter and Helen were married in Bathurst Australia in the early 1950’s. We located my real paternal grandfather in Jelenia Gora, Poland. I met him, and to my delight he was everything Peter Holowczak was not: intelligent, attractive, highly respected, and ethical.
When I was 14 years old, Grande Dame Patricia Ann Conlon chose me to succeed her. With Sydney being the capitol of Luciferianism, this effectively made Conlon the highest ranking female Luciferian in Australia. I was selected based on my Aryan appearance, IQ level, bloodline, flawless body, strength, skills and teachability. Women with blonde or red hair were candidates, and this related to the appearance of the Aryans / Pleiadians that (as the history well books document) the Nazis aspired to.

              Blood-liners are encouraged to marry within their caste. The father of my children is of the Gardiner Luciferian bloodline. He is the blood relative of Tony Gardiner, the mother of the current King of Jordan who converted to Islam and changed her name to Muna. Therefore, my daughters are double targets of this Luciferian cult. I have striven to protect my kids from the cult’s kidnapping and luring attempts. Cult members who serve in the NSW Police force attempted to kidnap my 10-year-old child, in 2015. My efforts to fight this resulted in the NSW police apologising to my daughter and giving her a police showbag.
Child rape, torture, and murder are routinely practised within Luciferianism for various reasons:
These acts are established traditions thought to appease their god Lucifer.
Some members get off on raping and murdering kids, but not all. The ones who like it were conditioned to be sexually aroused by it through being abused and exposed to such practises as children.
It is believed to bestow power on the practitioner. Sodomy is called the ‘fountain of youth’ and is thought to transfer the child’s youth to the abusing adult.
Luciferianism is a cult. Cult indoctrination alone is a strong enough influence on human behaviour. But the impact of indoctrination is reinforced by fear of the consequences of betraying or exposing the cult. The number one rule of Luciferianism is – there is no such thing as Luciferianism. At age 6 years, I was well taught this lesson. I was taken into a national park. There I witnessed a man (who was a traitor) have each of his 4 limbs tied to 4 different vehicles which drove at high speed in opposite directions. That incident taught me not to talk about the Luciferian cult I was raised in.
Mind control is a Luciferian tradition stemming back thousands of years. Luciferian offspring are trained in witchcraft, astral projection, and psychic manipulation of the physical elements. Children are tested at age 3 for whether they should be raised with conscious or dissociated awareness of their cult involvement. Children with a strong ethical objection to cult practises are never made aware of their involvement. These children are forced to dissociate through trauma, and their minds fragmented. My husband and I were two such children.
My memory of my involvement in these cult activities were mostly dissociated from my everyday thinking. Some awareness slipped through, such as when at age 12 years, the mother of my best friend Fiona LeCornu-Levett, came to collect me from my step-grandfather’s house, to take me to her Macquarie Fields home for a visit. Jan Levett overheard me screaming at Peter Holowczak that he was never to touch me again, by order of the Sutherland Shire high Luciferian priest Leonas Petrauskas. As we drove off in her car, Jan asked me what on earth that was all about. I diverted the conversation. But I forever recalled the incident in my conscious mind.
I also remember the time at age 11 years, when I tried to tell my mother about my child abuse. I started the conversation by saying I was special. My clueless mother told me I was telling fibs, and so I abandoned this attempt.
When I was 8 years old, my mother, brother and I painted a mural on my bedroom wall. I drew what I described as a Dr Who time tunnel, after the image seen during the opening credits of the British TV series. I was trying to tell my mother that I had just been suffocated during an Egyptian rebirth ritual in which I was placed in a grave over a decomposed body, while the Book of the Dead was chanted. I died, was revived, and awoke in Sutherland hospital, surrounded by concerned medical staff. I had a near death experience while I was unconscious and saw a tunnel that resembled the one shown at the start of Dr Who. I was trying to tell my mother what the cult did to me.

               My memories of Luciferianism immediately flooded my conscious mind in the form of sudden onset vertigo and PTSD flashbacks, after Peter Holowczak was found hanged to death at Easter, 1991. My memories did not emerge due to therapeutic intervention, hypnosis, or the like. The coroner’s report ruled the death suicide. However, Helen told my mother that a group of men arrived at her house that day and ordered her to go shopping. On her return, Helen found Peter hanging from his chook shed. “You killed him!” Helen screamed at me when I visited her with my mother and husband, to confront her about Peter’s sexual abuse of me. My Uncle John pointed out that I was not even in Sydney when Peter died. What Helen meant was – the cult killed Peter as punishment for mistreating me and driving me far away from Sydney.
Peter Holowczak was not solely to blame for my leaving the cult. Antony Kidman (Nicole Kidman’s father) and Rosalind Frances Croucher (current president of Australian Human Rights commission) were to blame. I was selected as Grande Dame by my predecessor, Patricia Anne Conlon. Rosalind Croucher was ambitious, jealous, and wanted the position for herself; Consequently, after Patricia Anne Conlon’s death, Rosalind Croucher sought revenge by organising the Bathurst City Hall birthday gathering in 1985, in which I was raped on an alter by B-grade actor Bruce Spence in front of a room full of Luciferian pedophiles including multiple NSW Police and Catholic priests. Rosalind Croucher presided over this violation of my human rights, alongside NSW Police commissioner John Avery, Australian cricket captain Richie Benaud, and ASIO officer and federal politician Kim Beazley Snr. During the ritual, a fully pregnant breeder and her unborn baby, plus a group of approximately 10 children, were ritually murdered on stage. The whole sordid event ended in a pedophile orgy in which I was gang raped by a group including Rosalind Croucher who urinated in my mouth.
The Bathurst City Hall crime gave me grounds for leaving the cult. I had just turned 16 when I was summoned before the Luciferian Grand Council that met in Sydney University’s MacLaurin Hall.
Sydney University hosts the Australian headquarters of the OTO (Ordo Templis Orientis) which Antony Kidman and my other key perpetrators were members of. When I was aged 9 years, I witnessed Antony Kidman preside over the ritual murder of a young boy in Sydney University’s Great Hall. Nicole Kidman was 11 years old and present, sitting in the front row, during this murder. This was an OTO themed ritual murder, with Kidman and four others dressed in rather camp, theatrical coloured robes based on the Eastern Star pentagram which dominates the Alistair Crowley Thelema offshoots including Freemasonry and the OTO.
I bring your attention to a document titled, Ordo Templis Orientis, INTERNATIONAL CAMP, OASIS AND LODGE MASTER’S HANDBOOK, Revised Spring Equinox, 2002. Page 33 of this document lists the name Kylie McKiernan as treasurer of the OTO. Kylie was in a senior administrative position within the ABC broadcasting network in 2015, when the ABC TV show Media Watch publicly attacked me for speaking to a press conference about my child trafficking experiences. The presenter of this show is British Intelligence.
Page 22 of this handbook states:
Don’t sacrifice animals or perform any other actions or practices which might adversely affect the Order’s reputation or legal standing, including…explicit sexual acts at official or public-access events.

                That’s something you wouldn’t read in your local football club handbook. So why do the OTO feel it necessary to warn their members not to publicly perform ritual blood sacrifice?
The Freemasons were also involved in my abuse. I was subjected to Luciferian pedophile rituals at various Masonic Temples, including Antony Kidman’s home lodge at 317 Pacific highway, North Sydney.
My leaving the Sydney based Luciferian cult left them in a pickle. A Grande Dame assumes the position by drawing in the dying breath of the previous Grande Dame. During my Grande Council hearing, Antony Kidman warned me I would amount to nothing without the cult’s backing. True to Kidman’s word, my ability in, and pursuit of, every one of my interest areas has been thwarted by cult members to this day.
I will give you an example. 20 years ago, I worked as a parole officer. I was appointed to the Corrective Services office at Burleigh Heads. A woman named Catherine Hand wanted the job of boss of Bulreligh Heads office. So, her mate Rod who was regional director of Corrective Services seconded the current boss of Burleigh Heads office, against his will, to work at an office one hour’s drive north of his Burleigh home. John had been boss of a fully functioning Burleigh Heads office for 20 years. Catherine Hand who had a diploma in art and zero experience as a parole officer, took over and systematically bullied out the existing Burleigh Heads staff and replaced them with young inexperienced women like me. On one occasion, she pinned a, 18-year-old parole officer named Chris up against the wall. She screamed at him the he was a “fucking idiot!” in front of the convicted criminals who were present in the office. Chris was a brilliant young employee who went on to work for the Federal police.
One day, Catherine Hand took me aside for a little chat. “Fiona, have you seen my ring?” she asked me. She showed off her ring which was an Eastern Star pentagram with coloured gemstones. “This is my coven ring,” she explained. “Every two years, the women in my coven meet up, no matter where we are in the world. Fiona, if you play your cards right, you will go far in management.” Catherine Hand informed me that a pottery lecturer from the Queensland College of Art (where she and I had both graduated from) was also a member of her “coven.”
I had only been at the office 3 months and was disgusted by Catherine Hand’s mistreatment of existing staff; so, I declined her offer by saying, “I’m not management material.” The following day, I lodged a formal complaint against Catherine Hand for her mistreatment of staff. Catherine then physically assaulted me by pinning me to a wall and sticking her face in mine. She gave me 10 minutes to vacate my desk. The Department of Corrective Services then sent me a letter to say that I had done nothing wrong but that I was being let go because I had been filling in for a woman on maternity leave (that was the first I had heard of this). I lodged a complaint with WorkCover. The government then hired a private detective to harass and film me at taxpayers’ expense. The second in charge of the department told my barrister that she could “Do whatever the fuck we like” to me.
The latest workplace at which I was targeted by Luciferians was Bond University. My Bond University supervisor, Norm Barling, a former Bond University lecturer, contemptuously called my Forensic Psychology lecturers, Katarina Fritzon and Rebecca Doley “lesbian witches” after these women lied to the Australian health board about me and so destroyed my psychology career, despite my excellent academic record. Their attack came after I rejected Katarina Fritzon’s sexual advances which included two sexual assaults, objected in class to pro-pedophile lecture content, and exposed Bond University’s coverup of a child sex trafficking ring that involved the Queensland state Department of Children’s Services (DOCS). This was linked to a South East Qld DOCS pedophile ring that police raided in the year 2000. DOCS staff were intentionally placing foster children with pedophiles who were prostituting the kids out. These child trafficking DOCS staff had passed working with children safety checks. My adhering to mandatory reporting legislation was supported by the head of the Queensland Children’s Commission, despite Bond University having withdrawn my complaint without consulting me, determined there were grounds for investigating my complaint.
I was somewhat vindicated when Bond University forensic psychology and criminology lecturer Paul Wilson was convicted and imprisoned in 2016 for pedophilia. Paul Wilson published pro-pedophilia articles on the Bond University website, in which he claimed children were willing participants in pedophilia and not harmed by it. In the 1980s, Paul Wilson organised a pro-pedophilia conference at University of Queensland, and in class he accidentally showed the end of kiddie porn snuff film. Paul Wilson’s wife Robyn Lincoln, also a Bond University lecturer, was on the advisory board of Bravehearts, a fake child abuse victim advocacy group which targets victims of VIP child abuse for silencing. For example, see the biography of Sarah Monahan, the child TV star who was sexually abused by actor Robert Hughes on the set of the Hey Dad! TV show. Bravehearts tried to destroy Sarah’s case.

                 After Paul Wilson was publicly exposed as a pedophile, Terry Goldsworthy, a Queensland Police officer, took over Paul Wilson’s position as head of criminology at Bond University plus Robyn Lincoln’s advisory board role at Bravehearts. Terry Goldsworthy, whom I’ve never met, misused his position as a Queensland police detective to communicate with the NSW Police regarding the complaint I made in 2008 about the 1985 Bathurst City Hall ritual crimes. I came forward to Bathurst police detectives after Tor Nielsen reported to police that he saw 60 children ritually raped in the same hall by NSW Police and Catholic priests who worked at nearby St Stanislaus College. Multiple St Stanislaus College pedophiles have since been charged and convicted for the ritual abuse crimes Tor Nielsen reported.
Terry Goldsworthy lied by omission when he failed include my age during this 1985 ritual and reported me as an adult perpetrator instead of a 15-year-old victim of child abuse, to the Queensland Psychology Board. He said NSW Police had confirmed this allegation and that I was the subject of a police investigation. I wrote to police commissioners in both Queensland and NSW who sent me letters confirming Terry Goldsworthy had lied to the Queensland Psychology Board and to the Queensland AHPRA office. I complained to the Queensland Police about Terry Goldsworthy using his role as a police officer to access, twist and misuse my private file, but they supported the perpetrator instead of me.
Bond University’s criminal behaviour was the final straw which prompted me to go public about my child abuse. The corrupt Queensland Psychology Board’s support of UK sexual predator Katarina Fritzon’s false and vexatious notification against me, prompted me to lodge my own complaint against Sydney registered psychologist Antony Kidman to the NSW Psychology Board and NSW AHPRA office. Kidman was dead within weeks of my notification against him. Nicole Kidman’s personal security team informed Sydney Paparazzi that Antony Kidman was placed on immediate suicide watch following my notification against him. You see, I was not the first to complain to the health board about Antony Kidman. I have since been contacted by other Antony Kidman victims of rape, torture and unethical hypnosis. Many of these victims were child sex trafficked through Hillsong church. So, I found a strong link between Antony Kidman and Hillsong church. Hillsong church was founded by pedophile Frank Houston for the sole purpose of procuring child trafficking victims and produce kiddie porn snuff films. Hillsong ritually abused children.
The Luciferian pedophiles have infiltrated all areas of Australian government, education, health and human services. They have control over the police, media, universities, defence forces, parliament, schools, health services, churches of all denominations, psychiatric hospitals, and fake child abuse advocacy organisations like Bravehearts. You can not possibly understand their pervasiveness unless you were raised in their world.
I will now explain the link between Luciferianism and the CIA’s Project MK-ULTRA, demonstrate the existence of Project MK-ULTRA in Australia, and identify key MK-ULTRA perpetrators and MK-ULTRA abuse locations in Australia.
MK-ULTRA subprojects were conducted in most Australian hospitals, universities and research facilities throughout the 1960s, 70s and 80s. MK-ULTRA’s presence in Australia stemmed from a 1951 security military agreement between our country and the USA. This agreement led to the establishment of the Australian Atomic Energy Commission in 1952, and the construction by the same US company, of two multi-story underground CIA research facilities, one at Lucas Heights (in 1958) and Pine Gap (in 1967). Pine Gap served as the endpoint for data collected all over Australia.
Sydney University was the centre of Australian MK-ULTRA research. MK-ULTRA university-based research was kicked off in Australia by CIA psychiatrist and hypnosis expert Martin Orne. In 1960, Orne conducted MK-ULTRA Subproject 84 under the title ‘Attitude Formation, Decision Matrices’ at Sydney University during a two-month lectureship. Subproject 84 was funded by the US Airforce Office of Scientific Research under Grant Number AF-AFOSR-88-63. A further $30,000 was provided by the Human Ecology Fund, ‘To study the nature of the hypnosis process as it may relate to induction of a changed motivational state.’
Martin Orne’s visit to Sydney University was sponsored by USEFA (United States Educational Foundation in Australia) and the Australian branch of the Fulbright Scholarship and Lectureship Program. The Fulbright program was a CIA scheme for recruiting and training MK-ULTRA scientists and spreading MK-ULTRA know how.
Months prior to his Sydney University visit, Martin Orne presented a paper, ‘Antisocial Behavior and Hypnosis’ at Colgate University, at the invitation of Psychology professor George Estabrooks. A hypnosis expert and self-confessed CIA operative, George Estabrooks once boasted:
“The key to creating an effective spy or assassin rests in splitting a man’s personality, or creating multi-personality, with the aid of hypnotism… This is not science fiction… I have done it.”
Subproject 84 aimed at determining whether hypnotised people would commit dangerous and harmful acts they wouldn’t otherwise. The resultant article, ‘Social Control in the Psychological Experiment: Antisocial Behaviour &amp; Hypnosis,’ was co-authored by Martin Orne and Frederick Evans, a Sydney University psychology student. Their article, published in the Journal of Personality and Social Psychology (1965 [1], pp 189-200) featured the following abstract:
Rowland and Young found that hypnotized subjects were willing to carry out such apparently antisocial actions as grasping a dangerous reptile, plunging their hand into concentrated acid, and throwing the acid at an assistant.
This publication also notes: “We wish to thank A. G. Hammer, then acting Head of the Department of Psychology, for his cooperation with the use of departmental facilities.”
Beginning with Subproject 84, the University of Sydney became a major centre for MK-ULTRA hypnosis research during the early 1960s. Psychology professor John Sutcliffe led a research group that included fellow psychology professor Alfred Gordon Hammer and psychology students Frederick Evans, Peter Sheehan, Campbell Perry, and Wendy Walker. These researchers all went on to make significant contributions to MK-ULTRA hypnosis research. Most of them also went on to serve on the False Memory Foundation Board, a CIA entity founded by MK-ULTRA perpetrators and pedophiles to discredit the victim accounts of CIA child trafficking, ritual abuse, and MK-ULTRA mind control.
In November 1962, John Sutcliffe published an article titled, ‘Personal identity, multiple personality, and hypnosis’ in the International Journal of Clinical and Experimental Hypnosis [Vol. 10 (4), pp 231-69]. Sutcliffe’s study considered whether multiple personality disorder stems from hypnotic suggestion, and if “degrees of proneness to multiple personality are predictive of degrees of hypnotisability.” MK-ULTRA mind control involved using unethical hypnosis to dissociate the mind and result in multiple personality disorder or DID.
In 1963, Frederick Evans was granted a CIA Fulbright Scholarship to continue hypnosis research with Martin Orne at Harvard. In 1966, Evans and Orne assumed positions at the University of Pennsylvania when it was a hive of MK-ULTRA hypnosis experimentation. Students Peter Sheehan and Campbell Perry joined them. Alfred Hammer likewise spent two sabbaticals in Martin Orne’s USA laboratories during the 1960s and 70s.
In 1961, Wendy Thorn received a post-graduate research scholarship at the Australian national University (ANU) for studies on the placebo effect, after completing her thesis in 1960 at Sydney University, on posthypnotic amnesia. In the same year, she presented a paper to the APS on, ‘Hypnosis and Suggestibility.’ Thorn notes in her 1962 ANU thesis that, “This study would have also lacked a great deal without the information, advice and materials supplied by Professor H. J Eysenck.” Hans Eysenck was then director of MK-ULTRA Subproject 111.
In 1963-4, Wendy Thorn was involved in hypnosis research with MK-ULTRA Subproject 84 Dr Frederick Evans. She was currently receiving CIA funding via the Studies in Hypnosis Project that was directed by Martin Orne. Frederick Evans received a Fulbright Scholarship to work with Martin Orne at Harvard in 1963. Wendy Thorn later continued to work with Frederick Evans and Hans Eysenck.
During the 1950s and 60s, most leading Australian universities had professors and students in the CIA’s MK-ULTRA program, including Australian National University, La Trobe, and the University of Western Australia.

                  Most chairs of the Australian Psychological Society (APS), the body that certifies our psychologists, were involved in unethical MK-ULTRA research. These included Alfred Hammer who chaired the APS in the 60s when MK-ULTRA began, and Bond University’s first professor of psychology Bob Montgomery who conducted unethical experiments at LaTrobe University in Melbourne in the 1970s, which left participants permanently traumatised. LaTrobe University lecturer Gary Dorsett wrote an article entitled, ‘Boiled Lollies and Band-aids: Gay men and Kids,’ in Gay Information Quarterly Journal (Spring, 1982) in which he advocated for the legalisation of pedophilia.
Bob Montgomery also lectured at ANU. Leonard G. H. Huxley served as Vice-Chancellor of ANU from 1960 to 1967. Leonard George Holden Huxley was on the board of USEFA at the time it oversaw the Fulbright Lectureship being granted to Martin Orne. Huxley was appointed to the board for the 1960 period and was also on the board of the CSIRO (Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation, which also conducted MK-ULTRA research), with Richard Casey as the Executive. Richard Casey helped establish ASIO and ASIS and helped secure funding for USEFA in 1959.
I have provided a short introduction to the documented, irrefutable presence of Project MK-ULTRA in Australia. My researcher Steve McMurray has uncovered much more that I don’t have time to share here.
I was subjected to MK-ULTRA procedures on the campus of Sydney University. These acts of crime were perpetrated by Sydney University staff from the faculties of Chemistry, Medicine, Dentistry and Psychology, and alumni who maintained lifetime association with their University. Other, international perpetrators visited and used Sydney University facilities to abuse me.
Most of my key perpetrators attended Sydney University together, at a time when Sydney University was both the centre of MK-ULTRA research plus the national headquarters of the OTO (Ordo Templis Orientis). Dr Leonas Petrauskas graduated with a diploma in Tropical Medicine in 1957, while Dr Antony Kidman was enrolled. Kidman and Telford Conlon graduated second year Chemistry together in December 1959, the same year Conlon’s future wife Patricia Anne Carden passed third year English. Holsworthy military consultant anaesthetist Colonel John Overton (who was Antony Kidman’s next-door neighbour), and celebrated heart transplant surgeon Dr Victor Chang graduated in the same medicine class together in 1962. Actor John Bell (who gang raped me with Kidman) also graduated from Sydney University in 1962. Rosalind Croucher studied at Sydney University also.
My recruitment as a MK-ULTRA lab rat began with my abuser Leonas Petrausaks who was an expert in sea creature poisons and published papers on this in PNG. Petrauskas attended the Australian School of Pacific Administration (ASOPA) which emerged from Sydney University's Department of Anthropology. ASOPA was a cover for MK-ULTRA activity, weaponised anthropology, and MK-NAOMI bio-weapons research conducted in Papua New Guinea. MK-NAOMI received CIA funding through MK-ULTRA Subprojects 13, 30 and 50. Documents show, in PNG, Petrauskas worked alongside notable MK-ULTRA recruits including Margaret Mead, and Hitler’s chief bio-weapons scientist, Erich Traub.
ASOPA was founded by Labour party connected Alfred Conlon, who worked for British Intelligence. Alfred Conlon recruited anthropologist Camilla Wedgewood to ASOPA. Camilla Wedgewood had ties with British Intelligence and she worked at Sydney University. Alfred Conlon also appointed CIA agent John Kerr (also my rapist) as principal of ASOPA.
Australian Prime Minister Gough Whitlam (another of my rapists) appointed his friend John Kerr as Governor General of Australia. After Whitlam threatened to expose Australia’s CIA agents, and shut down the CIA underground facility at Pine Gap, the CIA orchestrated a coup against Whitlam. The CIA employed ‘their man’ John Kerr to enact archaic legislation to dismiss Whitlam on behalf of the British Monarchy. Bob Hawke (also my rapist) who also worked for the CIA, played a role in ousting Whitlam. Whitlam was forced into compliance since the CIA had him compromised as a pedophile.
Alfred Conlon’s son Telford not only studied with Antony Kidman at Sydney University, but they later published research papers together. Telford Conlon married Patricia Anne Carden. Patricia Anne Conlon’s National Archive file is currently sealed for reasons of national security. This indicates Ann’s association with intelligence agencies, and her role in the CIA’s Project MK-ULTRA. As Luciferian Grande Dame, Patricia Anne Conlon’s role was to supervise the selection and training of children. This training included esoteric knowledge and skills and employed trauma-based mind control techniques. Patricia Ann Conlon easily transitioned to work for the CIA where she assisted in the selection and training of MK-ULTRA child victims.
Patricia Anne Conlon was publicly recognised as a pioneering feminist and communist who worked for Labour Party pedophile Neville Wran. Patricia Anne trained in MK-ULTRA techniques while undertaking a postgraduate scholarship in 1964-65 at the University of Saskatchewan, Canada. MK-ULTRA was rampant at the University of Seskatchewan when Patricia Anne was on a social sciences scholarship there. Professors Humphrey Osmond and Abraham Hoffer were the two biggest MK-ULTRA perpetrator names after Aldous Huxley. The Rockerfeller association funded Osmond and Hoffer’s research into adrenochrome. Adrenochrone is a chemical created from oxidised adrenaline. It occurs in the blood of traumatised ritual murder victims. When drunk, it gives the blood drinker a drug induced high and sexually arouses them. This is what occurred during the Luciferian black mass conducted at Bathurst City Hall.
Antony Kidman and Leonas Petrauskas were close associates of Dr Harry Bailey who was trained in deep sleep methods by MK-ULTRA perpetrator Ewan Cameron. The CIA funded Bailey’s MK-ULTRA deep sleep project at the notorious Chelmsford Private Hospital in Sydney. I was subjected to MK-ULTRA procedures by Harry Bailey, in the presence of Kidman and Petrauskas, at Chelmsford.
Antony Kidman was a psychology student at Sydney University during Martin Orne’s experiment and lectureship. He later studied at the University of Pennsylvania with famous clinical psychologist Aaron Tim Beck (another False Memory Syndrome Foundation board member). At the University of Pennsylvania, Kidman became a long-time colleague of Martin Seligman, whose Learned Helplessness research formed the core of the CIA’s torture program.

                   Antony Kidman returned to Australia in 1972 after years of work at St. Elizabeth’s Hospital, Washington DC, in the Laboratory of Preclinical Pharmacology, which was involved with LSD research and served as a hub of the Scottish Rite Schizophrenia Research Program. Both Jacqueline Goodnow and John W. Gittinger had performed research at this hospital and it was one of the major centres for MK-ULTRA research.
John Gittinger was the CIA’s head psychologist. He developed the test battery (PAS) used to assess potential CIA case managers and agents. Gittinger trained Antony Kidman in MK-ULTRA mind control methods and directly supervised the MK-ULTRA techniques perpetrated against me. These techniques included torture, physical assault, sexual assault, drugging, electrocution, and unethical hypnosis.
The mind control aspects of my abuse mainly occurred at laboratories in Sydney University, Holsworthy Army Base, Lucas Heights nuclear reactor, and Pine Gap. Holsworthy is Australia’s oldest military base. It is located south of Sydney near my grandparents’ Engadine home. Holsworthy Army Base sits adjacent to Lucas Heights nuclear reactor, now called ANSTOW (Australian Nuclear Science and Technology Organisation). Lucas Heights nuclear reactor is a 20-story underground research facility that was connected via underground tunnel to another (7-story) underground research facility at Holsworthy Army Base.
Data and material collected from these labs were delivered to Australia’s main CIA / US Military underground facility at Pine Gap. Holsworthy and Lucas heights both featured underground rooms dedicated to Luciferian ritual and the worship of their ancient deity Dagon. All top Australian military brass were Luciferians. Most Sydney University staff were Luciferians.
MK-ULTRA experiments and end-goal procedures were conducted using children as lab rats. These child victims were sourced from Luciferian covens, various cults, BoysTown homes, Daruk Boys Home, government and church run juvenile detention centres, child protective services, foster care, police lock-up, Catholic churches, child prostitution brothels, blackmailed pedophile parents, and Hillsong church (founded by pedophile Frank Houston). Some children were kidnapped off the streets. Other children were specifically bred to serve as human lab rats, their births not registered. Children were imprisoned in cages beneath Holsworthy and never saw daylight. Children were tortured, raped and murdered in the name of national security, with the full knowledge and blessing of the Australian and United States governments.
As George White wrote Sydney Gottlieb in 1971:
“…it was fun, fun, fun. Where else could a red-blooded American boy lie, kill, cheat, steal, rape, and pillage with the sanction and blessing of the All-Highest?”
There were two main categories of CIA child trafficking victims:
Those considered dispensable and destined for murder, and
Those deemed useful on a long-term basis (a fate worse than death).
I was in the latter group. At age 5 years, I was presented before a panel in the loungeroom of Leonas Petrauskas’ Engadine home. This panel included John Gittinger, Antony Kidman, and Grande Dame Patricia Anne Conlon. There Gittinger asked me if I like to be special, and he promised to make me special. Immediately afterwards, Gittinger subjected me to a battery of tests at Holsworthy, including a full physical exam, endurance testing, IQ testing, and multiple brain scans. Gittinger then accepted me into the MK-ULTRA program based on my high IQ, creativity, physical strength and endurance, blue-eyed blonde features, bloodline, and intuition. John Gittinger particularly sought my visual-spatial cognitive ability, or right hemispheric strength.
The Nazis recognised Luciferian based esoteric knowledge and techniques as a power source that they sought to weaponise. That is why they travelled the globe collecting esoteric knowledge and dissociation techniques from the pedophile Dali Lama and other Nazi collaborators.
The end goal of MK-ULTRA was to create super soldiers. They used child soldiers for this purpose. I was one of those children recruited into Delta Special Operations. Delta is comprised of MK-ULTRA victims. I recently spoke with a former member of Delta and asked him about what I recalled. He told me he only heard rumours of a super soldier program with children being employed as soldiers, to keep up with the Russians. Saw nothing himself. But as I pressed for info, this person dissociated, became indecipherable, and began stuttering references to MK-ULTRA programming cues. So, I’d say all Delta Special Ops soldiers have dissociated from their knowledge of the CIA super soldier program. I knew this as the Jason Project.
I was put through full military training at age 6 years and assigned to a small unit of all male soldiers. My basic soldier training was supervised by Colonel Victor Change at Holsworthy Army Base. Chang was a CIA asset with training in brainwashing and torture techniques. The Australian public knew Chang as a famous heart transplant surgeon who was gunned down in a gutter in a manner befitting his true criminal nature. Chang’s assassination was rumoured by mainstream media to be in connection with black market organ trafficking.
My training was completed in the USA at age 14 years by Lieutenant Colonel Michael Aquino in a special laboratory established at Dulce underground base. Delta training included the weaponization of psychic ability, or psychic warfare training.
During the 1950s, the CIA funded John Lilly’s development of the sensory deprivation tank, and his research into brain waves and altered states of consciousness. In his book, Programming and Metaprogramming in the Human Biocomputer, Lilly explained how children can be programmed MK-ULTRA fashion using LSD and his sensory deprivation tank. Indeed, the most fundamental MK-ULTRA programming levels (i.e., Alpha, Beta, Delta, Omega and Theta) are laid via LSD trips in a sensory deprivation tank. The brain naturally splits into five dissociative states, which is why there are five basic compartments. My five basic splits were organised according to an Eastern Star pentagram shape, with a gatekeeper placed in the pentagon which sat in the middle of five doors.
During the 1950s, the CIA simultaneously funded Robert Monroe’s development of what is called the Gateway Experience, or Hemispheric Synchronization. This is commonly known as astral projection. Newspapers and army documents record that the US Army sent soldiers to Monroe for training in the Gateway Process. In the UK, standard military police training 25 years ago consisted of remote viewing which enabled MPs to patrol UK bases located in foreign territories.
I bring your attention to a US military document approved for release by the CIA in 2010. The document dated 9 June 1983 is addressed to the Commander of US Army Operational Group at Fort Meade, by Lieutenant Colonel Wayne M. McDonnell. The subject heading reads, ‘Analysis and Assessment of Gateway Process.’ This document describes the physics behind interdimensional astral projection as engaged in by the military.
I bring your attention to a January 14, 1953 memo entitled ‘Interrogation techniques’ which states:
If the services of Major Louis J. West, USAF (MC), a trained hypnotist, can be obtained and another man well-grounded in conventional psychological interrogation and polygraph techniques, and the services of Lieutenant Colonel [DELETED], a well-balanced interrogation research centre could be established in an especially selected location.
Major Louis J. West coordinated MK-ULTRA experiments at UCLA. Documented in mainstream newspapers and magazines, including Psychology Today (1974), these experiments involved behavioural conditioning of autistic children using cattle prods, physical violence, and electrocution via an electrified metal floor. West hired Ivar Lovaas to conduct the experiments, who in turn regularly consulted the father of operant conditioning, B. F. Skinner.
I know the names of the two men whose names are omitted in this document. They were John Gittinger and Lieutenant Colonel Michael Aquino. I know the location of the research centre. It was built at the underground military base located near Dulce, New Mexico.
A circa 1956 untitled document describes the “research centre” or “laboratory” which the CIA constructed at Dulce:
This laboratory will include a special chamber, in which all psychologically significant aspects of the environment can be controlled. This chamber will contain, among other things, a broad-spectrum polygraph for simultaneous recordings of a variety of psychophysiological reactions of the individual being studied. In this setting the various hypnotic, pharmacologic, and sensory-environmental variables will be manipulated in a controlled fashion, and quantitative continuous recordings of the reactions of the experimental subjects will be made.

                    The “chamber” at Dulce was an upright version of John C. Lilly’s sensory deprivation tank. Lilly’s sensory deprivation chamber was combined with the Gateway Process to develop MK-ULTRA victims’ psychic abilities, and to engage in the extreme interdimensional astral travel which included contacting and communicating with interdimensional entities, as described in the Fort Meade document released by the CIA in 2010.
According to US military documents, candidates for the Gateway Process required high intelligence, imagination and creativity - the very characteristics CIA psychologist John Gittinger assessed me for. Gittinger was particularly interested in right hemispheric functioning. High IQ children have a visual-spatial learning preference. When they perform cognitive tasks, both brain hemispheres are activated, as compared to individuals of average intelligence whose left hemisphere only lights up. High visual-spatial processing ability was essential for visualisation during MK-ULTRA training, and for the Gateway Process. That is why Gittinger tested me at age 5 years using the Stanford Binet LM and the Block Design subtest of the Weschler series, the best measures of visual-spatial IQ.
Following training, my unit and I were deployed to South America where the CIA were conducting operations against so-called communist governments.
When I was a child, the CIA said our enemy was communism. Today, the CIA says our enemy is terrorism.
The CIA continue to make money out of child trafficking by laundering it through banks and funnelling it into CIA terror organisations that have decimated Syria and other nations. In 2016, Syria’s representative to the United Nations publicly stated twice that ISIS forces were armed with genetically modified super soldiers produced and supplied by the USA. In 2015, 7-foot tall genetically modified engineered soldiers were filmed beheading 21 Christians in Egypt during the CIA-orchestrated Arab fundamentalist uprising. These super soldiers are described as Caucasian not Arabic in appearance. They resemble the super soldiers developed at Pine Gap and Dulce 45 years ago. Putin recently said Russia are developing super soldiers that are “worse than nuclear bombs.” I know exactly what he meant.
Australia’s Commonwealth Bank was recently fined 700 million dollars for 54,000 breaches of anti-money-laundering and anti-terrorism financing laws. Nicole Rose, head of AUSTRAC, the organisation investigating money laundering by banks, said it involves organised crime, child exploitation and drug importation. The Commonwealth Bank laundered money obtained from child sex trafficking and funnelled that money into international terrorist activities.

                    <p>
                     I reiterate: Child trafficking is run as a single integrated world operation. This operation is coordinated by the CIA.
I bring your attention to a 1978 book entitled ‘Dope Inc.’ The latest edition was published in 2010, but I highly recommend the 1978 copy which is available free online. This book revolutionised the way drug law enforcement officers consider drug crime. It led to the HSBC bank losing its licence to operate in the USA. Dope Inc authors found that drug trafficking is run as a single integrated world operation, from your cartels down to the person who sells drugs to junkies on the street corner. This operation started with the Opium Wars where the British Monarchy forced China to accept heroin produced in India. Two well recognised organisations stemmed from this operation: P&amp;O cruise ship line was established to transport the heroin; and the Hong-Kong-Shanghai Banking Corporation (HSBC bank) was established to launder the drug money. The court Jews that served the British Monarchy, including the Rothschilds, managed the money made from this heroin trafficking operation.
Dope Inc then explains how the drug trafficking and related money laundering operation established in the Opium Wars, is the exact same operation in existence today. In fact, HSBC was in recent years fined by USA authorities for still engaging in drug money laundering. If you follow the money trail, it still leads back to the British Monarchy. This is the same British Monarchy that I witnessed engage in Luciferian ritual crimes in 1980 at St James Anglican church in Sydney City. The book Dope Inc devotes a chapter to explaining the British aristocracy’s involvement in an ancient Egyptian cult, how Britain started the drug / rock n’ roll counter culture in the USA with the help of the CIA, and the links between Egyptian cult practises, the counter culture, and the CIA which was established by British Intelligence. Dope Inc explains how and why the CIA run modern drug trafficking and money laundering as a single integrated world operation.
When you read Dope Inc, if you cross out the word ‘drugs’ and insert the word ‘kids’ – then you have a picture of the CIA child trafficking organisation that violated my human rights.
I fought to make police witness statements about the crimes I witnessed and was a victim of. I completed four days of witness statements, and police commenced an investigation which included door knocking around Engadine and raiding the home of my deceased grandparents. Police had promised to take another 5 days of statements. But suddenly everything was shut down. I later received a cold call from a lawyer who said that the Sutherland police detective in charge of my case was herself a child trafficker and member of the pedophile network she was supposed to be investigating.
The attacks on my family by NSW police, ASIO and other institutions have been relentless. I have documented these, and even obtained photos of the military looking thug who chased me about Sydney when I tried to make police witness statements. It’s not paranoia - when you have photos.
The way I have been treated for daring to speak up about my child abuse, and for taking a pro-victim stance against Luciferian pedophiles, has been far worse than my original abuse. The authorities who are supposed to support victims have done nothing but sabotage my case. They have engaged in what I have learnt from interacting with other victims, as tactics typically used to discredit and silence victims.
The current Australian Child Abuse Royal Commission is yet another damage control and information gathering exercise. VIP child trafficking victims who testified to the Royal Commission have ended up being targeted for silence.
Since I appeared before the Royal Commission several years ago, I have been contacted by hundreds and hundreds of child abuse victims. A considerable number of these are victims of what I endured - CIA child trafficking, ritual abuse, and CIA mind control. From what these victims have shared with me, I now have a very clear picture of child sex trafficking in Australia. I will give you an example of what I have learnt from victims:
The NSW Police were the subject of a 1990s Royal Commission conducted by Judge James Wood. This investigation stemmed from allegations of child sex trafficking in Sydney involving the same Luciferians and pedophiles who trafficked and abused me. The Wood Royal Commission was a white wash. Commissioner James Wood covered up reports of child sex trafficking involving Hillsong church, Antony Kidman, Daruk Boys home, Costellos boy brothel in Kings Cross, judges, lawyers, Catholic churches, day care centres, and NSW police officers. Multiple victims named Kings Cross underbelly boss police officer Roger Rogerson. Rogerson was responsible for the murder of Sally Ann Huckstep, who died after she wrote a story on child prostitution at Kings Cross for a porn magazine, in the days when porn magazines published pedophilia material. The clean cop who refused to report Sally Anne’s murder as suicide, had his career destroyed and life threatened by NSW Police after he testified to the Royal Commission against his corrupt colleagues. That police officer is still in hiding in a state of trauma. Roger Rogerson never brought to justice. In 2016, Roger Rogerson was imprisoned for a 2014 murder.
Another notable perpetrator named to the Wood Royal Commission was Bob Carr. Bob Carr served as an ABC journalist, Premiere of NSW, and Minister for Foreign Affairs in the Australian Federal government. In 2012, Bob Carr and Kim Beazley Jnr (son of ASIO agent Kim Beazley Snr who trafficked me to Bohemian Grove), attended Bohemian Grove pedophile summer camp at Australian tax payers’ expense.
Commissioner James Wood covered up all reports of VIP child sex trafficking, ritual abuse, and mind control. This is not surprising, considering James Wood was named by victim Dean Henry and others to the current federal Child Abuse Royal Commission as a member of the very pedophile ring he was employed to investigate.
I will now mention the two most abhorrent and famous criminal cases in Australian history. One is the backpacker murders committed by serial killer Ivan Milat. The other is the murder of a beautiful young nurse named Anita Cobby, committed by a gang of young men including Les Murphy. Ivan Milat murdered victims in a Luciferian ritual manner, so did Les Murphy. The details of both murders have not been released to the public. I discovered what was done to Anita Cobby through two people who read her case file; a lawyer who worked on her case, and a prison guard who read Les Murphy’s file. What the public were never told is: Les Murphy and his killer gang made deep lacerations in Anita Cobby’s body and had sex with those wounds. That sort of crime can only be learnt, and it is the sort of crime taught to child victims of ritual abuse.
Both Ivan Milat and Les Murphy were abused and taught to commit Luciferian style rape, torture and murder during their incarceration at boys’ homes. Les Murphy attended Daruk Boys Home where boys were prostituted by staff to VIP pedophiles and used for MK-ULTRA experiments including Subproject 74: the psychological effects of circumcision. I saw the botched circumcision of one Daruk victim who had his penis cut off make international mainstream news headlines. Daruk’s use as a source of MK-ULTRA child lab rats explains why many victims’ files were destroyed.
Ivan Milat attended Engadine BoysTown at age 13, the same place where my father, brothers and I were abused, and where victims were recruited for MK-ULTRA experiments. Ivan Milat was in the Luciferian cult that abused me, and the Milats associated with the Holowczaks. Ivan Milat sought victims to be used in Luciferian rituals and helped dispose of bodies afterwards. He closely associated with the Slavic dog breeder. Ivan Milat procured boy victims for abuse by VIP pedophiles at Costellos boy brothel. Les Murphy worked behind the bar at Costellos boy brothel when he was 16 years old.
My final point is this: ALL major crime within Australia stems from the single integrated world trafficking operation that I have described. If you disband this operation, you will virtually eliminate the trafficking of children, drugs, and guns in our society – and perhaps worldwide.
That is my statement.

             That happens with most Steemit links. When there is an @ in the url, it splits it off, probably because on Voat you use @ to ping someone. If you copy and paste the url, it works. I think there is a way to embed the link without writing out the url, which would solve your problem. Thanks for your input to this website, by the way.

             Could you please fix that steemit link and add it to the main body so that this post will satisfy rule 2?

              I hope I fixed that. Kinda makes me jumpy all this stuff as I have lived inside this world of coverups and murder for way too long. I am just putting this out there so we can all stop this insanity. Still, I am just the messenger

                 , the @ is screwing up on voat because we use the same tag system, it needs to be written as a

            Most of my perpetrators were raised Catholic, and many associated with the Catholic colleges located at Sydney University, particularly Patricia Ann Conlon who lived at Sancta Sophia College at Sydney University. Patricia Ann Conlon (nee Carden) was the Grande Dame of the Sydney area.
As Jesuit high priest, Leonas Petrauskas presided over Luciferian rituals committed in the following Catholic Churches:
Regina Coli Church, Beverly Hills, Sutherland Shire (which was gifted by, and closely associated with, the US military),
BoysTown chapels located at Engadine, Sutherland Shire,
St John Bosco church located opposite Engadine BoysTown
Other key Catholic sites of Luciferian ritual were:
St James chapel located on Sydney University campus,
St Mary’s Cathedral, Sydney City.
Luciferianism is arranged according to a hierarchical structure which vaguely resembles a caste system. At the very top sit 13 family dynasties including the Rothschilds and the British Royal Family. These are recognised by the cult as demi-gods. Below these sit approximately 300 Luciferian bloodlines who are generally high IQ, although this tends to have been watered down in some families due to intermarriage. Below this group sit the commoners who can never attain higher status because they lack the desired bloodline. These are your random covens based on nationality (e.g., there’s a strong Scottish coven in Bundaberg), sexual orientation (e.g., Bond University has a lesbian coven), gang membership (bikie gangs), or self-styled, whatever goes these days. It is from these lines that the cult obtains ‘breeders’ - women who are forced to breed unregistered babies for sacrifice and sex trafficking. We refer to these bottom feeders as ‘coven scum’. Their behaviour is usually barbaric and requires constant management to stop them exposing the cult, and they show no respect for those in the caste above them. There is much jealousy and animosity directed by these lower members toward the blood-liners.
I stem from one of the 300 bloodlines via my biological paternal grandparents - not the Holowczaks who had the IQ of a toilet block and so resented my heritage and status within the cult. I question whether Helen Holowczak is my biological grandmother, and whether she used my father as just another prop to escape Europe. Helen lied to the European immigration authorities by saying Peter Holowczak was her husband and the father of my father. Peter and Helen were married in Bathurst Australia in the early 1950’s. We located my real paternal grandfather in Jelenia Gora, Poland. I met him, and to my delight he was everything Peter Holowczak was not: intelligent, attractive, highly respected, and ethical.
