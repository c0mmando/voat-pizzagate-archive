<p>“Pandas4Bernie” has come up several times in the past several months relating to the Seth Rich “murder” of July 10, 2016.</p>
<p>There is a Reddit user, a Tumblr account, a Twitter account, and a FaceSpook account called Pandas4Bernie.   They are obviously the same group of individuals as the posts are identical on all four platforms.</p>

<p>If you look at the post dates, you will see that these accounts posted in 2016 and into 2017.  E.g., the oldest post visible on the Twitter page is dated January 27, 2016, and the most recent is of May 22, 2017.  On June 11, 2016, about a month before SR’s “murder,” the account posted the group’s “Manifest for a Movement” replete with communist raised-fist icon.</p>

</p>
<p>That was the final post for the year 2016.  The prior post was dated March 13, 2016.  The next post is dated May 22, 2017.  This illustrates how sporadic the posting on these accounts was.  That makes sense if you think about the frenzy of the Democratic primary – with HRC named Democratic nominee on July 26, 2016 -- and the subsequent election. </p>
<p>The Tumblr account’s initial post is also dated January 27, 2016.  The Tumblr account has far fewer posts.  That is not surprising since Tumblr is a less active social media platform.</p>
<p>Zero Hedge included in their May 19, 2017 article, “Seth Rich’s Reddit Account Discovered - Loved Pandas, Patriotic Clothes, and Joe Rogan” (linked below) the following old (now archived) post from Reddit that includes speculation. </p>
<p>“Here\'s where it gets interesting: <a href="https://voat.co/user/pandas4bernie">/u/pandas4bernie</a> and a tumblr by the same name ALSO stopped posting at the same time as this account. If that\'s Rich, then that proves motive. Rich was a BernieBro.”</p>

<p>That’s pure speculation, and shame on Zero Hedge for including it in their piece.  
</p>
<p>If Seth Rich was such a big “BernieBro,” then why is it that the group Pandas4Bernie – which has been posting all along, both PRE and POST Seth Rich’s “murder,” says that they never heard of him until he “died?”  This post appears on all four platforms.  
</p>
<p>“Hi. We are Pandas4Bernie. And we’ve come back to say a few things about the speculation raging on the internet about our social media account and the late Seth Rich.</p>
<p>First, let\'s state the obvious: <strong><strong>this account did not belong to Seth Rich. We created Pandas4Bernie as a collective project, to build a library of educational memes we hoped would be fun and useful for grassroots progressives. We never heard the name Seth Rich until news broke of his untimely death in the aftermath of the DNC email leaks.</strong></strong> That terrible week at the DNC was the final straw for many of us; so we made the decision to retire Pandas4Bernie and made our #Demexit, most of us moving on to the Greens.</p>
<p>Imagine our surprise when nearly one year later, we learn that our dormant little panda lair had been re-discovered and cast as a major piece of a viral conspiracy meme;” </p>
<p>Pandas4Bernie even issued a public statement posted on the WikiLeaks subforum that they are not SR and unrelated to him.</p>

<p>I hope this clears up this portion of the “panda” stuff surrounding Seth Rich.</p>',

            So getting shot in the back while walking down the street eventually leading to death in the hospital might not be "murder"?  Why the scare quotes?  What's your theory, he shot himself in the back, twice?
