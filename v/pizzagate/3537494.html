<p>The article title and summary may not necessarily reflect the actual statements depicted in the article itself, it is recommended that you read it for yourself. Here are some takeaways though:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Maxwell denies all claims, wanted her interview(s) sealed, said she can only testify to what she knows (her time present at Epstein\'s residences) and that everything Virginia Roberts (now Giuffre) says is a lie - but settled defamation suit (over accusation of being a liar), out of court, brought by Giuffre.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>As is so often repeated in these articles, Prince Andrew denies the claims about him.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>From article:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Ms Maxwell insisted she \'barely knew\' Ms Roberts despite overwhelming evidence to suggest the women had seen each other on a number of occasions.</p>
<p>The teenager was standing next to Ms Maxwell when she posed with Andrew on the upstairs landing at her Belgravia home in a now notorious photo taken in 2000.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="break"></a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>And flight documents show that the two women had also flown together on Epstein\'s private jet – nicknamed \'The Lolita Express\' – no fewer than 23 times.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It\'s mostly a lot of blah blah blah (in the sense of little new information), but we get some details on the previously sealed content.</p>
