            Produce a witness in the case who was in El Salvador.
           </p>
           <p>
            The witness, Hector Cruz, was deemed 'crucial to the case' as it was he who had discovered Paddock's alleged stash of child porn after evicting him from squatting on his property back in 2014. Right there is the missing piece of this puzzle. Is he dead? Does he even exist? What is this place that Paddock squatted upon, a business, or a home? How could a third world guy afford to buy property in the USA, and go home, never to be seen again? Someone/more is full of it. Where is the fakestream media outrage?

            Lmao. Rest in piss to the DA’s thot daughter. I find it interesting these people didn’t seem to want to do anything until someone close to them (thot) was affected.. but that’s just if you’re taking it at face value..
           </p>
           <p>
            There’s clearly much more going on here than that tho, and like others here, I suspect this guy was framed in order to keep this Vegas situation under wraps.

            Hugo Daniel of the Daily Mail owed his readers a bit more information.  The brother was apparently homeless and  sqatting on private properrty where he left a cashe of  child porn which was turned over to the police in 2014. An arrest warrant was issued but law enforcement  couldn't find him.  A better effort was made to locate him after the mass shooting and  he was found and charged with possession of child porn.
           </p>
           <p>
            Problem was the owner of the property  was now in Mexico and the prosecution was unable to produce the only witness to the offence. The court rejected the last minute motion to postpone the trial  to give the prosecution more time to obtain the star witness. The main witness could not be compelled to return to the USA. As for the claim of predjudice that a DA's daughter had been killed, that usually results in a change of venue, not dismissal.
           </p>
           <p>
            Thus the judge's ruling was predicated on the unavailability of the only witness to the crime of  possession. We all are guaranteed the right to a speedy trial. The judge may not have had a choice in the matter. However, Mr. Paddock will forever live with the stigma of child porn hanging over his head which will punish him socially since the Internet lives on forever.

            'Because of this, Mr Paddock's local arrest shortly after the Las Vegas shooting was also covered widely in the media solely due to his familial link to the Las Vegas shooter.
           </p>
           <p>
            Paddock, 59, was charged with 'possession of over 600 images of child or youth pornography' which included '10 or more images of a prepubescent minor or a minor who was under 12 years of age'.
           </p>
           <p>
            An LAPD police report in the court file states they found a computer, compact disks and a three-ring binder all filled with child pornography as well as a yellow envelope addressed to Bruce Paddock.

             They should have put him in protective custody or at least taken a video testimony of him naming the big names. Or the cops were paid to stand down so the pedo guys could kill him. The big movie and TV moguls like Billionaire David Geffen and Ryan Murphy with his $300 Million Netflix deal they can afford to hire hit men and they do it all the time. They also pay off the cops to look the other way.

            Shit like this is why I think the fanaticism of pedo hatred needs to be tempered, otherwise feds can accuse anyone they want to disappear of having CP and places like voat just eat that shit up without questioning anything.

            could these charges have been a Mockingbird look over here trick they played in the first place?
           </p>
           <p>
            awful convenient, I remember trying to tie Stephen to the porn
           </p>
           <p>
            and seriously, who was the woman they wheel chaired out of the airport
           </p>
           <p>
            we know FBI Aaron Rouse was lying and hiding, Campos interview with Ellen was a hoax
           </p>
           <p>
            everything that tied to the LV shooting that we were told by Police and FBI was BS
           </p>
           <p>
            So some guy with El Salvador ties calls in and says this squatter on my property has a stash of child porn,
           </p>
           <p>
            now this had to be before he was tucked into a nursing home right?
           </p>
           <p>
            after shooting, they go find him, put him in a wheelchair too and take him in
           </p>
           <p>
            So the witness that called in is in El Salvador, and this witness is crucial to the proceedings,
           </p>
           <p>
            and lawyer squawking unfair trial because of shooting, which should have been established before even a court date in my opinion
           </p>
           <p>
            So case comes down to one witness in  El Salvador
           </p>
           <p>
            illegal search?
           </p>
           <p>
            was there even child porn?
           </p>
           <p>
            FBI would base a case because of one witness?   :)
           </p>
           <p>
            wasn't he the broke brother, always in trouble?
           </p>
           <p>
            if he had CP, did brother give it to him? was their relationship like that, I got the impression no one had much to do with him
           </p>
           <p>
            Just what kind of set up was this?

             I remember seeing him (quite lively) on youtube explaining that he was shocked about this, and had not seen his brother in a long time, like they were estranged. That was the video where everyone thought he was on coke, and it sure did look that way. Home in Orlando general area? I could be wrong about that, but from homeless squatter, to nice looking home, and nursing home is quite the bounce.

                  I'm local Las Vegas. I was a god damn domestic war zone that night.  My husband takes CBD (legal for work) to help with his PTSD when he heard active shooter at MGM and ran for his life and never wants to go back there now. I've listened to the 911 tapes, watched the body cams, studied the FIT report, and read the journalistic reports.
                  <br/>
                  All I know for sure there is WAY more to the story.  There HAS to be. None of it fits together AT ALL! We are gonna get out in a bit.  It's not safe and more corrupt than I ever dreamed of.

              During the interview, Paddock recounted the night he found out about the mass shooting.
             </p>
             <p>
              "I woke up at two in the morning for my 2 o’clock medicine, saw that CNN and every channel had this shooting. I looked again and they said Stephen Paddock," he said in disbelief.
             </p>
             <p>
              “I called my mom and my mom answered the phone and I said ‘Is that Steve?’ And she said, ‘I guess so,’” Bruce said. “I asked her ‘Was he sick like me?’ And she didn't want to talk about it.”

                 They are all missing eyebrows. easier to spot if we paint some on with names attached, for future reference. Seriously, I saw an underage female pimp walking an even younger girl in my hometown with the same characteristic  facial features. One has to wonder.

             Yep. I have a feeling that a lot of the child porn cases we see are not what they see. I suspect that people who might be good people, and are thinking about divulging crimes they know about, suddenly end up with child porn on their computers that they had nothing to do with. Planting child porn on a potential witness is an effective way to crush a potential witness.

            I have a feeling they are double crossing him.  They said to him, hey we have all this child porn on your computer.  We will let you get off the hook easy if you say these specific things about your brother.  Done deal. Now to clean up they just have to kill him.

            Look into Leeland Yee and the Philippines and Muslim extremism in the Philippines like ISIS and look into human trafficking in Saudi Arabia and Philippines and see how this connects because the Saudi's are some of the nastiest and worst nasty human traffickers and the Philippines has a human trafficking epidemic. Paddocks all were running humans and children for people in the Philippines and Saudi Arabia. That's where Bruce got his child porn from the Philippines and Saudi Arabia. Paddocks ran humans for them and FBI agents in the Mandalay Bay it explains the 3 women prostitutes that Paddock checked into the Mandalay Bay with. And there was a dispute over the women

              The stash of child porn was allegedly found by a property owner and turned in to the police after Paddock was evicted - OVER THREE YEARS AGO.  Why so long?
             </p>
            </li>
            <li>
             <p>
              The prosecution wanted to delay the case so the property owner could appear as a witness.  Did they not have other evidence, like fingerprints, linking Paddock to the pictures and computer?  Was that man's testimony the only evidence?
             </p>
            </li>
            <li>

              Paddock was a squatter.  The property owner likely had a beef with him.  The child porn could've been revenge being taken.  This might explain why Paddock wasn't arrested, because the cops smelled something wrong with the case.

            Bruce Paddock needs to start naming names now and say where he got his child porn. He knows what's up he needs to come clean now. He'll be dead by the end of the year anyway. So he might as well speak and say what;s up.

            I now think the judge was ordered to throw the case out to cover up what Stephen Paddock was really doing he was an FBI asset he was framed for the shooting his hotel room was used for a big weapons deal then it went wrong and they killed Paddock who also had his own airplanes that he probably used to bring kids into this country from overseas. I think both Paddock brothers were FBI assets and the judge was told to get rid of this case fast so none of the dirt would come out in open court. They had to let him go to keep the dirty FBI officials covered up. There are way too many things wrong with the official story of the Las Vegas Shooting and other sites have photos of Swat Team guys shooting at the crowd from a nearby roof plus police helicopters in the air possibly firing down on the crowd. The real truth will never be known at this point.

             Helm look into how the crown prince of Saudi Arabia was staying at the 4 seasons which makes up the top 4 floors of the Mandalay Bay hotel. He can be seen on camera being escorted from the Tropicana with his security team when the shooting started at the Mandalay Bay hotel. Upon returning home to Saudi Arabia a day or so later is when that big sweep of family members and corrupt politicians went under way and they froze 700 billion in assets from among the royal family. Rumor has it that it was a failed assassination attempt and it spiraled out of control in an alleged effort to cover tracts and distract. No one will prob ever know the truth but I think there is something to those facts and just maybe someone smart enough can put some more pieces together.
