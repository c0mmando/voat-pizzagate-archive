<p>This is related to Pizzagate because it concerns the dark underbelly of the international adoption industry which <a href="http://www.brandeis.edu/investigate/adoption/index.html#TheLie">as one critic </a>describes it, has been &quot;a Wild West, all but free of meaningful law, regulation, or oversight&quot; where babies and children from poor countries are bought and sold by unscrupulous entrepreneurs. </p>
<p>Russian adoptions have been in the U.S. headlines for the last few days because of the sensational news of the meeting in Trump Tower last summer between Donald Trump, Jr., and Natalia Veselnitskaya, a Russian attorney who claimed to be lobbying influential Americans for the restart of Russian adoptions in the U.S. which were banned in 2012 by Putin in what many observers believed was retaliation for the Magnitsky Act.</p>
<p>In Trump\'s startling interview yesterday with <a href="http://www.politico.com/story/2017/07/19/trump-putin-discussed-russia-adoption-g20-">the NY Times last week </a>he revealed that during his private conversations with President Putin during the G20 summit, they discussed &quot;Russian adoption&quot;:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“I actually talked about Russian adoption with him,’’ he said, in the* Times* interview. “Which is interesting because it was a part of the conversation that Don had in that meeting.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>NEW DEVELOPMENT</strong></p>
<p>Lo and behold, &quot;Russian adoptions&quot; came up again yesterday in Ed Butowsky\'s contentious exchange with Chris Cuomo about Rod Wheeler\'s lawsuit against Fox News. Butowsky is a Republican donor who hired Rod Wheeler as a private investigator for the Rich family.</p>
<p>Ed Butowsky said he spoke to Sean Spicer at the White House, and made this startling statement:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Sean and I talked about many things. You won\'t believe it, but coincidentally, we talked about Russian adoptions, just like Don Jr.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Now I see on Twitter, a concerted effort by MSM to turn &quot;Russian adoption ban&quot; into a narrative of &quot;Wicked Putin sacrifices poor handicapped Russian children as political pawns in retaliation against US sanctions against Russia.&quot;</p>
<p>WRONG. Putin\'s govt. has been increasingly alarmed by cases of Russian adoptees being abused/killed/trafficked by Americans since 2008 when he barred 3 adoption agencies from conducting business in Russia---among them the notorious European Adoption Consultants.
In 2011 FM Sergei Lavrov instituted stricter supervision and regulations over Russian adoptions in US during the &quot;Russian Reset&quot; so when Putin signed the Dima Yakovlev Law on December 28, 2012---the Feast of the Holy Innocents, a date fraught with meaning---this was the next step in an ongoing effort to curb an already-existing crisis. The next year, the Russian govt. <a href="http://www.againstchildtrafficking.org/2013/12/russia-launches-criminal-probe-into-online-trafficking-of-adopted-kids-in-us/">launched a criminal probe</a> into illegal adoptions (rehoming) and the online trafficking of Russian children by Americans.</p>
<p><strong>CONCLUSION</strong></p>
<p>Could <a href="http://www.sfgate.com/bayarea/amp/Los-Gatos-couple-pleads-to-sexual-abuse-of-their-11728776.php">this report today</a> of a wealthy Los Gatos couple convicted of horrendous criminal sexual abuse of a Russian orphan be the beginning of a flood of stories resulting from that probe? </p>
<p>Could it be that the glaring references to &quot;Russian adoption&quot; by President Trump and Ed Butowsky are signals to those of us that are paying attention that the Seth Rich/WikiLeaks/DNC hack/NataliaVeselnitskaya/Russian collusion narrative is really about exposing trafficking of Russian children by Clinton and Podesta? .IS HE ABOUT TO BLOW THE LID OFF OF THE INTERNATIONAL PEDOPHILE PIPELINE?</p>
<p><strong>TO BE EXPLORED NEXT</strong></p>
<p>The intriguing story of the mysterious Natalia Veselnitskaya, whose purported reason for coming to Washington, DC, was to &quot;restart the popular program of Russian adoptions in the US&quot; and who even started a foundation to that end. </p>
<p>My hypothesis is that she used this as a ruse to draw in Washington pedophiles but her cover was blown. However, she came into contact with Seth Rich somehow and he gave her access to the DNC/Podesta emails which contained incriminating information on the international pedophile network which she conveyed to Donald Trump, Jr. Do not forget that shortly after Trump\'s inauguration, Feb. 14, 2017, the European Adoption Consultants was raided by the FBI and shut down. I BELIEVE THIS WAS THE RESULT OF INFORMATION THAT NATALIA GAVE TO DONALD TRUMP, JR.</p>',

            So she got expedited into the US by Obama admin, thinking they would have a new supply of yummy little treats, when in fact,  She met with Don Jr.  And of course, because the last admin used the State's intelligence apparatus, they were able to put a full package on her.  She may have just slid a USB across the table and never said a word.  Or something irrelevant.  The USB probably had hard evidence as to some of the big pedo busts.  Since the Deep State didn't get their new supply line back, they used the meeting as another piece of "evidence" to fit in with the "Russia conspiracy".

            - the baby rapists now in jail for 40 years Mark J Newton and Peter Truoung say the Russian government was homophobic for delaying their published gay marriage activist baby rape world tour.

            It's a crime to link to this video. Put "abcplugspedos" into www.caselaw.nsw.gov.au and see what happens

           <p>
            For the crime of linking to that videeo about Russian infant rapists and nothing else - you get prosecuted for being a gay basher, because to hate russian infant screaming anal rape is gay bashing! Note the judgement for the "abcplugspedos" and this newspaper article are both June 25th 2015
            <a href="http://www.theherald.com.au/story/3172166/ex-cabbie-told-to-stop-gay-bashing/">

            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            The case law says all he did was link to that video and nothing else. Therefore if someone says they are gay and anal rapes a Russian baby - it is against the law to oppose what he did to the little baby - because gays must always be respected no matter how loud their child rape victims scream!

            If you expose this the government comes after you big time, as what happened to my friends and my dad... Yes they sued my dad just like John Sunol. And now the OTO kiddy fuck cult and the facebook.com/policeglbti are suing John Sunol too more info:

            Authoritarianism is awful, but I can understand why a country might resort to such desperate measures when faced with the horrors hiding behind the closed doors of Washingtons political elite. Surely Putin has had more insight into this for longer than we have. His anti-gay policies makes more sense when you look at how the deep state use homophilia as a steppig stone for normalizing more depraved stuff.

             We have authoritarianism here, as well. Difference is we aren't told who's in power. (Eg: soros directing Hillary and the dnc - see the WL emails if they're still there. A vote for Hillary is a vote for Soros, her boss. He's been in charge for a long time - and of course those above him.)

            Love or hate his policies, the real reason many of us voted for our man was this deep rooted evil corruption. He may have his own skeletons in his closet. Its practically impossible to do business at the level he does without greasing a few palms with bribes. 'Costs of doing business' as they say in the industry, but at least he is doing something about trafficking.

           <p>
            Somehow? Seth Rich "somehow" coming in contact with Natalia Veselnitskaya is easily explained if the Seth Rich story is a school play to prove Russian collusion in getting Trump elected.
           </p>
           <p>
            Everything else is irrelevant in this story. The MSM isn't interested in nor will report anything positive that may have come from Seth Rich contacting Natalia Veselnitskaya. The MSM will only use that as evidence of Russian meddling in the election. You even agreed with me last night, remember?
           </p>
           <p>
            Me:
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             All the Deep State needs is evidence of Trump colluding with Russia. The MSM is so hopelessly in bed with the Deep State they would never in a million years go to the level of detail you just did.
            </p>
            <p>
             Right? You know the MSM is bought and paid for. Given that glaringly obvious fact there is no benefit to your theory even if it was right.
            </p>
           </blockquote>
           <p>
            You:

            Seth Rich's "murder" is a

             school play
            </a>
            and part of the Deep State's effort to frame Trump. There is NOTHING POSITIVE the MSM would ever publish about Veselnitskaya's motivations. You should know better.

             Putin invaded Donetsk to protect Russian access to the Black Sea. To argue it was to stop a pedophile trafficking network is laughably naive.

              You are right that the invasion was about that but Western provocation of Russia involved setting up human and arms trafficking ratlines in Ukraine.
             </p>
             <p>
              Think of it this way--the trafficking
              <em>
               is
              </em>
              the control of the region. Population control all the way down to the drugs they use.

            Putin has mentioned, at least once before, that "The West" can't even protect their own children.  I have no doubt that the reason Russia won't let Americans adopt from their orphanages is because of pedophilia. The western elites obviously HATE Russia, I'm sure they'd get some sick sort of pleasure off doing a Russian kid in particular.  What if....just what if, the reason Russia is, quite literally, demonized by the press (that are all in on it) is
            <em>
             simply
            </em>
            because Russia is genuinely one of the very last, truly Christian/ western ideals and traditions countries out there?
           </p>
           <p>
            No, I don't think Putin is the 2nd coming of Christ....but I don't think he's a terrible person either and I do think of Russia as being the last outpost of the old Roman empire.  Them and flyover country in America. I really think the powers that be are terrified of the idea of Russia and middle America becoming allied.

             I just thought of something while google searching "elton john adoption". One article from 2009 says that Elton wanted to adopt a 14 month old Ukranian boy who had "stolen his heart". The thing that stood out to me is it's always boys!. Why don't they adopt girls? I have an idea...

             Would Ukraine have been the route out of Russia for Russian children to the west ? And could this be reason for the US interference in the civil war, To protect these routes ?
