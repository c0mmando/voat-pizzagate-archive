              Looks like the readme from 2 years ago is outdated. Besides, a good portion of the content of Voat actually is illegal in Switzerland; this is one of the reasons why they moved Voat to the US. The other is that the server provider was in Germany and got shut down for fishy reasons.

             The Pharaoh's, desendents of the Nephilim, got ran out out of the acient world because Mankind finally figured these where the creatures whom was responsible  for the evil this world has ever seen and who still are. They then immigrated to Switzerland where they one again set up secret societies to rule mankind.

New Genetic Study Suggests The Pharaohs of Ancient Egypt Were “Alien Hybrids”
            </p>
            <p>
             A new genetic study suggests a lineage of Egyptian pharaohs were subjected to willful genetic manipulation by a technologically advanced civilization. Some would call this definitive proof that the builders of the pyramids had a strong connection with beings that originated elsewhere in the universe, interdimensionally.
            </p>
            <p>
             Stuart Fleischmann, Assistant Professor of Comparative Genomics at the Swiss University in Cairo and his team have recently published the results of a 7-year study that mapped the genomes of 9 ancient Egyptian Pharaohs. If proven correct, their findings could potentially change the world’s history books.
            </p>
            <p>
             Fleischmann and his team subjected the precious samples of ancient DNA to a process called Polymerse Chain Reaction (PCR). In the field of molecular biology this technique is often used to replicate and amplify a single copy of a piece of DNA, giving researchers a clear picture of someone’s genetic fingerprint.
            </p>
            <p>
             Eight out of nine samples returned interesting but typical results. The ninth sample belonged to Akhenaten, the enigmatic 14th century BC pharaoh and father of Tutankhamun. A small fragment of desiccated brain tissue had been the source of the DNA sample and the test was repeated using bone tissue but the same results were obtained.
            </p>
            <p>
             One of the culprits was a gene called CXPAC-5, which is responsible for cortex growth. The anomaly is visible in the image below.
            </p>
            <p>
             It appears this increased activity in Akhenaten’s genome would suggest he had a higher cranial capacity because of the need to house a larger cortex. But what mutation would have caused a human brain to grow? We have yet to discover such a technique despite years of breakthroughs in genetics. Could this 3,300 year-old evidence point out to ancient genetic manipulation? Was it the work of advanced extraterrestrial beings.
            </p>
            <p>
             Is the mythology of ancient Egypt more than a collection of allegoric tales? Prof. Fleischmann explains:
            </p>
            <p>
             Telomerase [a genetic enzyme] is only expended by two processes: extreme aging and extreme mutation. Genetic and archaeological data suggests Amenhotep IV/Akhenaten lived to about 45 years of age. That is not nearly enough to consume all the chromosomal telomerase, leaving behind one inconvenient but possible explanation.
            </p>
            <p>
             This hypothesis is also backed up by the fact that electron microscope analysis revealed signs of nucleotidic cicatrix, which is a telltale sign of the DNA helix healing after being exposed to strong mutagens.”

              It all goes back to the Caananites. Cain was born from the serpent line. Abel was a pure blood. They was half brothers. Cain was the first murderer, he murderd his brother Abel then ate him. Cain ate Abel = Cainabel. Cain became a cannibul. Pizzagate, The irony eh!!
