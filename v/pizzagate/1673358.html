            I work in a branch of audio that is not overly technical (e.g., recording engineer) but still requires very keen listening skills. As a curious anecdote - that you are free to assume is fabricated - I lost touch with a friend for over twenty years as we both moved out of the city we were born in. One day, I was driving though a parking lot of a mall where I'm now living and had my window down. I heard someone say "it only has 20 000 clicks...". In less than a heartbeat, and with no remote expectation to run into the friend I lost touch with twenty years prior, in a city neither of us had had any connection with, and with just hearing five words, I did not think but rather knew it was him. I pulled my car around, drove back, and had a lovely chat about old times and his new truck.

            With the qualification above, the timbre, tone, inflection, and character of the voice in the videos is
            <em>
             very
            </em>
            similar to JP's, so much so, a match cannot remotely be dismissed out of hand, especially when one takes into consideration the meager quantity of recording samples available to those doing comparisons. While a minor point can be made that the accent is stronger in the videos, this is what one would expect in context of the activity engaged in.

             I have a finely-tuned ear and incredible auditory acuity. (I can hear a cricket fart a mile away.)  I also have done NOTHING but listen to the HUMAN VOICE through a headset for 8 to 12 hours per day, 5 to 7 days per week, for 25+ years.  Ergo, I am just as qualified as you if not more so.

             The voices are similar but too close to call. You are not a computer, and neither am I.  That is why VSA  (voice stress analysis) by a PROFESSIONAL (preferably former FBI) is necessary to determine once and for all if that is JP..

              VSA is not used for identification. Speaker Recognition or Voice Biometrics is what you are alluding to. Nonetheless, it is not an exact science. And in some types of pattern recognition and identification, humans are as good and sometimes superior to technology. Consider the art world. When was the last time you heard of a machine deciding whether a Picasso was a Picasso or a clever forgery? You haven't, because humans are better at this kind of analysis, even when the stakes could be tens of millions of dollars in getting the attribution correct.

            People have done live suicides on 4chan, posted pictures of people they've murdered, etc. There's no reason to think that just because WorldCorp posts it's content on 4chan that it makes it any less relevant. I'm tired of the "if its on 4chan its automatically fake" angle.

            So why do you think this history of prior reposting and linking without context reduces credibility instead of adding to it?
           </p>
           <p>
            It's already known that the the website in question has existed a while and hosted creepy, trashy content.
           </p>
           <p>
            i am not sure this debunks anything. did you ever question, why the material originated at all, or who actually did it? 
Because "group of people from 4chan" or whatever does not disprove any more than it proves. Although it does suggest multiple IPs, dynamic IPs, or spoofing. None of which proves or  disproves anything either....
           </p>
           <p>
            Unless you know the worldcorp story IRL rather than online, and can bring us new info, this doesn't seem productive in supporting or debunking.
           </p>
           <p>
            Breadcrumbs teasers, stuff hidden on the web cna be there for a while, for all kinds of reasons.
           </p>
           <p>
            If you think you are closer to the truth, get int touch with the worldcorp freak and bring his take on it. Someone supposedly linked was discussed earlier, but did that go anywhere?

             .  Shills have been here trying to discredit the fatherhood video hard.  Mainly saying oh it's from 4chan, some /b/ tard is out there laughing his ass off, if it was real why would it be hotlinked on the website then on facebook, it's all a big troll or distraction do you even internetz?!
            </p>
            <p>
             But none of these things negate the video itself, the child screaming, the voice that sounds like Podesta.  The circumstances of the video and where it came from or the site itself are not what matter, it's the voice on the video that matters.  And they will do anything they can to distract, shame, divide, make us feel stupid, anything to take us away from listening to the voice and comparing it ourselves.

              I would agree, the people from worldcorp have only show their faces a few times on 4chan and 8chan.  Just search "melvin creepyhands" which is the name of their CEO.

             If you don't understand the reason for him using this smiley you have zero understanding of 4chan culture. I don't think people realize that this is a website normal people use. A lot of people have used it since they were probably 13. There is a culture there just like on any other website.

            The videos in question have to be considered in isolation of the purported source. No one knows where WC procured them. In the last 48 hours of research I've concluded that no truth about the owner/operator of WC or its real intention is coming any time soon, but it is indisputable that the videos in question have seemingly incredible details that point to JP (voice match, "John" screamed by victim, "Skippy" spoken by third party, quick capture of arm of perpetrator that would be a perfect match for JP's physique) and that they portray real abuse. Coincidences abound, too many to dismiss out of hand, and the idea that WC operators anticipated JP/pizzagate conspiracy would explode a year before it did and posted the videos early on only so they could be exploited by them at this time, is highly untenable, and that is really what's implied by the OP.

             I'm not implying this. You can go on 4plebs and fucking search it yourself. They've been spamming this shit for a long time. To say I'm implying they did this, when you can go on 4plebs RIGHT FUCKING NOW AT THIS VERY MOMENT WITH YOUR OWN EYES and see them shilling their stupid x-tier art since 2015, is truly some head-up-ass shit the likes of which I've never seen before.

              So because WorldCorp has been around for a while, the videos can't possibly be real? Podesta has been in and around Washington for the past decade or more. Still don't see how the fact that the site has been around for a while automatically means that the videos are "fake" or that Skippy isn't in them.

              you should have kek'd before you rekt turbo
             </p>
             <p>
              your only semivalid point is that 4chan itself proves little (some would say nothing). so you're getting rekt by trying to basically prove a negative. well duh.
             </p>
             <p>
              the questions remain:
             </p>
             <p>
              who really made the vids?
             </p>
             <p>
              who's depicted in them?
             </p>
             <p>
              how did they get on the worldcorp server?
             </p>
             <p>
              who is worldcorp IRL (not on chans)?
             </p>
             <p>
              why is the site associated with a federal plaza address (or was that info also bogus?)?
             </p>
             <p>
              who is running that site now?
             </p>
             <p>
              why does it sound exactly like podesta?
             </p>
             <p>
              if not podesta, who was it?
             </p>
             <p>
              Whoever's depicted, it's criminal in and of itself.  Torture or inhumane conditioning techniques tantamount to torture are demonstrated. On children. Not ok, even if the children are SAG children with coked-up showbiz parents and psychologists.
             </p>
             <p>
              And I'm really not getting that vibe, seems more like ol' skippy to me.
             </p>
             <p>
              Don't you think it's hilarious, by the way, that within 24 hours of Podesta being put literally back on the WaPo/CIA/shadow government payroll, shill brigades and concern trolls multiply in every thread that mentions him?
             </p>
             <p>
              Now that he is officially an asset to be propped up again, I guess they know which account to charge. Your tax dollars at work.

             <p>
              EDIT: to add to all this, consider that the title of this thread is a complete LIE, because the thread DOES NOT ADDRESS the worldcorp website, its owner or operator, or its ORIGIN.

              Instead it talks about 4chan and soundcloud.

              There seems to be a problem with some posters who do not communicate their ideas explicitly enough. If I misunderstood you, then consider it a lesson to communicate your idea(s) better. Crazimal makes the counterargument on this topic better than I, but the
              <strong>
               fact
              </strong>
              that WC has been "spamming this $#!% for a long time" is entirely irrelevant to the question of whether the perpetrator in the videos might be JP.

               just to tag team your deserving carcass a little harder turbo, are ya still too stupid to ask "WHY" these specific videos were posted, instead of getting lost in where, and the lens of "Culture" and "art" you choose to see it through.
              </p>
              <p>
               Bottom line, they depict abuse.
              </p>
              <p>
               Even if totally staged with actors who agree to do it and have nice drugged out show-biz parents and psychologists to go home to (LOL for you there btw).
              </p>
              <p>
               The damn thing is basically demonstrating torture and inhumane conditioning/programming techniques, done by someone who sounds identical to podesta. Somewhere on earth this really happened, in some way, unless you are claiming it's all cgi and synthetic voice. And it ain't good.
              </p>
              <p>
               Some "Art" or "game" side of it is not any kind of excuse for it at all. It's very possibly podesta, and if not, it's 99% likely to be another criminal needing investigation.
              </p>
              <p>
               BTW its so hilarious how Podesta has been back on the CIA/WaPo/shadow government payroll for one fucking day and out of the shadows come all kinds of people trying to debunk everything that implicates him, isn't it?
