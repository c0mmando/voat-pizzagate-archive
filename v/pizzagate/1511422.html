           To sum it up, I was asking if there are terms like "dominoes on cheese" and "cheese pizza" that will now be replaced by the pedophile underground.  First response was lolicon, although I did ask if lolicons are into "cheese pizza".  Don't know if it was a troll response or not.  I replied with asking if that was what Otaku really means and asking about rave posters also attracting kids (raves are all ages parties with childhood themes, toys, bears, butterflies, and everything childlike that are filled with teens and twentysomethings going for the music and/or the drugs).

            I went to many raves back in the late 80s and 90s. Small venues and larger ones like the San Francisco Fashion Center were all pretty much the same. Lots of neon and a DJ spinning classic house beats. Never saw any kids. Well,  maybe a few 16-18 sneaked in but no little kids. Who would want little kids at an all night dance party. The themes were always neon glowing psychedelic lights and art. Drugs were limited to MDMA and some 'smart drugs'. Sex was weird on ecstasy so we always just danced. Rarely did we hear of bad trips or fights or people going missing from the raves. Things have really changed.
