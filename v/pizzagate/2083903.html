            You don't know the half of it. I had made a post about this with 95 upvotes and 100 comments about it and they deleted it.

            others got angry and even tried to make their own posts about it

            look at what one of the moderators rude ass response was (

            and had to personally request to unban me saying I was upset due to the thread being deleted. If you go on the last link and the my original one you'll see not just that their is subverses for cartoon and hentai pedo porn their is such subverses with real children such as

             Wow. I had no clue and if it wasn't for clicking through random I wouldn't. I am all for free speech but come on, how is that legal? Is the moderator who responded like that a mod of Voat as a whole or one of those subverses? If that is truly a Voat official's response I am done with this site. I want no part of something that is going to look the other way about that.

              That is truly a mod thats Crensch. Go look at the moderators here on the Pizzagate fourm he's on there. In fact another moderator named vindicator called me a concern troll and said we were part of an organized force to destroy Voat. Not even kidding.

               Wow yes I see that and now I can already predict the fate of this post - it is going to be deleted. Whatever if this mentality isn't even shared against others here in this subverse than Voat itself won't stand up to it. Sorry gamepwn, you seem like a cool dude but I am gone. Won't voluntarily associate myself with this place anymore.

                I completely understand. It's like the book 1984 it's a thought crime to oppose it here and it gets deleted even though 95 people agreed and upvoted it here. The way Crensch responded was disgusting. It's not the community who decides the fate of this investigation and what stays or goes here on Voat it's a single person who at a push of a button can delete your post and/or ban you.
