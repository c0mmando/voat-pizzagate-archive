<p>Relevant to pizzagate bc of the fact that Pizzagate and especially the spirit cooking aspect of pizzagate revealed ritual abuse practices. I do wonder why the BBC of all outlets is reporting on this, though? For those who don\'t know, the BBC covered up the thousands of rapes of children by notorious pedophile Jimmy Saville for decades. There were allegations of ritual elements as part of Saville\'s abuse, too.</p>
<p>Quote from the article:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;A child abuse inquiry witness has told how he was raped by priests during &quot;satanic&quot; drink-fuelled sex parties.
Dave Sharp also described a catalogue of sexual, physical and emotional violence at St Ninian\'s in Falkland, Fife, between 1971 and 1975.
Mr Sharp from Glasgow, said the abuse had left him with &quot;lifelong trauma&quot;.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;The independent Scottish Child Abuse inquiry is looking in detail at historical abuse of children in residential care.
Mr Sharp urged inquiry chairwoman Lady Smith, to piece together the &quot;jigsaw&quot; of victims\' accounts and called for a &quot;national discussion&quot; on the subject. The 60-year-old, who has waived his right to anonymity, was put into care after his mother died when he was aged one.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;The inquiry heard &quot;two or three&quot; boys were trafficked around Scotland and Ireland at a time to be used in drink-fuelled sex parties, which he described as &quot;satanic&quot;.</p>
<p>&quot;One occasion in Ireland was said to have involved 10 men taking turns to rape the boys. It was heard priests were among those involved and incidents took place over the duration of his time at St Ninian\'s, which was run by religious order the Christian Brothers. He left the home aged 16 without &quot;any memory other than continually being abused&quot;.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I think I answered my own question on why the BBC is covering this: they seem more apt to report on this kind of thing if it is perpetrated by the Church, than anyone else. (I am not religious, just observing)</p>',

Scottish connection to pizzagate.
Catholic church, Jimmy savile, Haiti, Clinton's, 
All the connections are there. I don't have the ability to collect it all and put it all together but it's all there. Massive cover up being attempted by the Scottish government, the SNP.

             The Christian Brothers, as they are commonly known, chiefly work for the evangelisation and education of youth, but are involved in many ministries, especially with the poor. Their first school was opened in Waterford, Ireland, in 1802.[1]:16–18 At the time of its foundation, though much relieved from the harshest of the Penal Laws by the Irish Parliament's Relief Acts, much discrimination against Catholics remained throughout the newly created United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland pending full Catholic Emancipation in 1829.

             Restructuring has taken place in the congregation to account for the changing needs, in particular the declining number of brothers in the developed world. The three provinces of North America (Canada, Eastern American, and Western American Province) restructured into the Edmund Rice Christian Brothers North America on 1 July 2005.[13] The provinces that cover Ireland, England and the Congregational Leadership Team in Rome combined into a single European province on May 5, 2007,[14] while the five provinces covering Australia, New Zealand and Papua New Guinea combined into one Oceania province on October 1, 2007,[15] The English Province is a registered charity.[16] The Dublin Headquarters are in the grounds of Marino Institute of Education, Claremont, Griffith Avenue, Dublin 9, Ireland.

             <strong>
              A special community within this new European province will be based in Geneva, Switzerland, working to establish an NGO known as Edmund Rice International.
             </strong>
             The purpose of such an organisation is to gain what is known as a "general consultative status"
             <strong>
              with the United Nations
             </strong>
             . "This position allows groups the opportunity to challenge systemic injustice and to engage in advocacy work with policy makers on behalf of people who are made poor." As well as including Christian Brothers from provinces all over the world, members of the Presentation Brothers will also have a presence within this community.

             In the last ten years some religious congregations have created NGOs in order to engage in advocacy for social justice. These religious congregations are usually congregations for whom acting with and for marginalised social groups is a constitutive element of their founding charism. Among the first such groups to achieve consultative status with the United Nations was Franciscans International. This NGO was created by the thirty or so religious congregations and groups that make up the Franciscan family. Since about 1997 an increasing number of congregations have achieved consultative status with ECOSOC. Among these congregations are:

The Sisters of Mercy were named as the chief among the institutes under whose care girls "endured frequent assaults and humiliation designed to make them feel worthless ... personal and family denigration was widespread"

             More like since its inception. There is a bloodthirsty pedovore death cult behind it. Kronos was the god of Italy to the ancient Greeks. The Vatican is definitely behind the mass deception.

               As a recovering Roman Catholic who once switched to Episcopalian, before deciding God is in my garden, I would have to agree.  But to be fair, I've also seen pedo headlines about the Mormons, the Baptists, and yes definitely, Jews.   Oh, and lets us not forget the Muslims.  Plus then we have our politicians on both sides of the aisle.  Seems to me pedo-satanism is the modern plague. Alas and alack, God have mercy on us all.
