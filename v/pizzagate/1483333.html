             I remember when I first read it....wow.  That was BEFORE #Pizzagate broke.  Wish people would have known back in July the right questions to be asking him.  But we do now, and he was right on about the Clinton Foundation!!!!  Never quit.  Keep fighting for the children.  #TrumpTeam4Families

            Must read and save, to get a good breakdown: Tavistock: The Best Kept Secret, educate-yourself.org and watch.pair.com/ freedomhouse MASS info. So much that fbianon mentioned! What a movie script. So many actors. As they scream fake news, these sites are full of meme potentials, too. The puppet master galore.

            Follow the money. It is about the money. Along with #PizzaGate...we can promote #PedoDollars.  Does anyone know the amount of money generated by human trafficking as compared to drug trafficking? Not sure, but I think it may have been posted here.

            This all are very interesting claims, like Jews and Saudis working together? Like, who did Israelis fought to death in several wars in 20th century then? Why the western left are so in love with terrorists from palestine, hamas and all?
           </p>
           <p>
            Also as a russian, I see a completely different picture in Russia with my eyes than this guy portrays. Putin and his buddies, who has taken control over Russia are confirmed gangsters and thugs, plain and simple. They made themselves and their friend very rich by selling russian mineral resouces, while the whole country is extremely poor, de-industrialized. Russian population is depressed, demoralized, all social institutes degradated and corrupt to the deepest core, there is a visible cast system built there, army costs are insane and completely secret, yet technically and morally the army is able to fight noone.
           </p>
           <p>
            Let me give you an example. Russia has 2(!) mazut(!)-fueled aircraft carriers, that were built in 80-s by USSR. One of them is Admiral Kuznetsov, that has been sent to Syria recently to fight. Russia has (had?) only 10(!) SU-33, soviet carrier-based fighters to be used on the aircraft carriers. Because Admiral Kuznetsov has no proper devices to accelerate the aircraft into the air, fighters has to take off with low fuel and little bombs, then re-fuel and re-arm at normal airfield and after the mission return to the aircraft carrier. Because Admiral Kuznetsovs engines are in very bad condition, he can normally move at 30% of his projected speed - 10-12 miles/h and it is constantly casting black smoke, pathetic view. Since it has been on the mission it has already lost 2(!) aircrafts because of landing-related problems due to poor technical condition and crew training. This is all you need to know about the condition of russian army. God knows in what condition are russian nukes.
           </p>
           <p>
            It is also well known, that almost every single top Russian official and bureaucrat has his dirty money in the west, has lots of property in the west, like Miami or Zürich or London, lots of them have eu/uk/us citizenships or residencies and their children study in most expensive western colleges, some of those kids just simply and plainly live in USA or UK, like russian foreign affair minister daughter(!). Russian elites do not give a fuck about Russia, where more than 1% of population has AIDS officially and it is growing over time. Russian elites just milk the remains of USSR for billions of dollars and then go off to live somewhere nice, like Monaco. What kind of confrontation are you talking about??
           </p>
           <p>
            Also complete bs about Russia being white and nationalistic! All significant russian nationalists are in prison already. Russia has a law against nationalism, you can get in prison for a social network post! Russia has no visas with countries like Uzbekistan or Tajikistan, russians are visibly being replaced by people from Middle Asia and Caucasus. And we do not talk about poor ghetto migrants. Armenians, Chechens and such are at power in Russia, they are the wealthiest, they own everything, they are all over the government, parliament, police and customs. Among 10 wealthiest families in Russia only 1 have russian names, others are from Asia/Jews/Caucasus.
           </p>
           <p>
            So if this things are not true, what else what this "FBIanon" says is not true as well?

            On the whole I think this is legit. However his comments on "blacks" and Soros was inconsistent. We are however just reading letters on a screen, and the break in consistency to me at least was noticeable. I'm wondering if we are reading the words of two authors, the latter's purpose being that of plausable deniability.

Donors state $10m amt to  CF
CF state lesser amt $5m rec'd from donors
           </p>
           <p>
            Could the diff be kids?  If so then examine those donors/transactions/shipping connections.  I   seem to remember Norway was one.   cadavear dogs can be hired if we suspect particular docks.

            Summation of alleged FBI leaker:
Focus on Clinton Foundation. Donors, Board of Directors - all implicated.  Read/Jerome Corsi.  Saudi Arabia visits and donations to CF.  Russian Uranium leaks.  Hillary and Israel lobby.  Council on Foreign Relations, AIPAC. List is endless.  Obama impeachment level.  HRC had Special Access Program leaked to her by someone. She sold them/? to overseas donors.  Treason.  Obama loosely tied to CF, but much more tied in w/the same people who donate to CF.
Soros at heart of all of this - the kingpin.  Bill/Lynch meeting:  "Focus on servers, don't prosecute CF." 
HRC sold weapons,  favors, intelligence and people to anyone willing to pay.  "Breath of info that would make your eyes fall out if you know what all was going on."  HRC donors have paid for war.
            <br/>
            Soros an ideologue.  Soros=puppet master.  Soros owns Tavistock.  Tavistock owns the government.  Soros funds, instructs, an influences every layer of US gov, right down to tax code.  US government fears revolution.  EU/NATO heavily pushed to war w/Russia.  Soros fear of horrors of WWII.  Orlando was CIA/alleged shooter pledged ISIS allegiance.
            <br/>
            HRC treason of every kind, multiple violations of Constitution and Espionage Act.
Release of Clinton Foundation records would create total chaos.  Government exposed at every layer:  Who pays who, Who buys What -- and all the human trafficking.  All our secret operations in other countries w/be exposed.
Libya was an arms operation in conjunction w/CIA-DOD to give arms to rebels.  We didn't deploy troops because we would have gone to war.
            <br/>
            Clinton Foundation -- Human trafficking.  Pedophiles are sex traffickers everywhere.  Many politicians trade girls like cattle.
Refugee crisis orchestrated.  Elites need serf population to work for cheap and breed out whites.  Bill Clinton is a confirmed pedophile.  Child prostitution ring.  Sex rings popular in all governments, but pedophilia is primary in British Parliament and Saudi Arabia, and that's why Bill and Hillary love foreign donors so much.  Paid in children as well.  Dig deep and you can find it and will sicken you.  Russia wants Ukraine back and then they want to be left the fuck alone to invest  Russia is more a paragon of freedom and nationalism than any other country.  Focus on Clinton Foundation.

            The problem with this paste ... is it's unsourced, unverifiable, and totally playing to the conspiracy theories.  I'm skeptical ... but I'll add it to the rest of the pile of puzzle pieces ... just a little farther off to the side.

             "FBIanon" suggested the emails, when scrubbed, would reveal links but also that people just needed to research into CF. So, if you look at other threads here, people have been doing just that - looking into who is involved in CF, who their associates were, and following the funding. I think George Webb's video series on CF CEO Eric Braverman has a wealth of info but it's very heavy in geopolitics and almost takes an insider to deconstruct. Nevertheless, I think that is a place to start.

              If you read over both of FBIAnons threads in their entirety, FBIAnon comments on the Holocaust. ill copy pasta some of the replies on the topic. for example:
             </p>
             <p>
              Q:  What is the goal at large? What do whom actually want? They're using slime region to destabilize western culture as a whole, but all for what, and why? What are the motives?
             </p>
             <p>
              A:  The goal (of Soros, since I assume that is what you are asking) is to create a global government where all people intermingle and breed and become one people ruled by a radically pure Jewish race. They sincerely believe under their rule all human conflict will cease because there will be no more cause for division. This desire is born out of a fear of the horrors of WWII. The Holocaust is a lie, but the death toll was still massive nonetheless. And many people were brutalized by it.
             </p>
             <p>
              Q:  Please elaborate on how the Holocaust is a lie.
             </p>
             <p>
              A:  You already know, population records do not support systematic slaughter of Jews.
             </p>
             <p>
              Q:  "The Holocaust is a lie"
    Is this common knowledge in the FBI?
             </p>
             <p>
              A:  It is at the top.
             </p>
             <p>
              There are more but i encourage you to read the entire FBIAnon threads for yourself here:

              ( same link as in the OP )
             </p>
             <p>
              Im not very aware of these claims, will do some research for myself, although admittedly i've dismissed these as "conspiracy theories" in the past.

               Keep in mind, FBIAnon said he would add bits of disinfo to cover his trail, so its possible that was disinfo (but doubtful, holocaust has sketchy details if you research it, and 9/11 is a clusterfuck)

               If you are interested in learning about 9/11 truths - please check out these three websites. They are filled with credible information by professionals in their respective fields and it just doesn't get more legit than that. From there, you can explore many, many, many other leads (I can share some - just PM me, don't want to pollute the tread). Just like PG, the deeper you dig, the more shocked and enlightened you will become.

                 The theory, based on eyewitness testimony, is that Mossad agents were involved. Not clear on whether they were the ones in unmarked vans arriving after the cleaners left and possibly being the ones who lit the place up w thermite or if they somehow helped with the "terrorists" pulling off the planning/hijacking. One theory was that Israel wanted Americans to feel like they do and to be up in arms enough to go to war. Thereby everyone gets rich and they have a large army to go after Muslim countries. Just my two cents from different sources...
And I agree the architects and engineers movie is a must watch.

            From what I've learned, there seems to be a few reasons at play here.

           <ol>
            <li>
             Use for satanic rituals

           <p>
            I believe they're all connected, as Satanists want to invert everything good and moral.

             I posted this exact question the other day, curious if anyone had any pieces to connect to "daisey's destruction", either got overlooked or ignored, so I guess not.  With everything coming to light, feels like there could be something there though

              I've been digging but can't find a connection yet. Him and his business partner, Anthony Nicholls used to run a business called Zantholls International and Skully fled to The Phillipines over fraud charges. It appears that they were 2 bit property investment scammers.

            Have we dug deeper into the British Parliament + Clinton/Clinton Foundation connection, or have we just talked about Jimmy Savile and the Lady Rothschild connection David Seaman made? Also know that China possibly has some involvment and some Indian business man?

             It makes perfect sense to be skeptical that an anonymous person on 4chan claiming to be a member of the FBI, is actually a member of the FBI. But I think it's also important to not miss the forest for the trees.
            </p>
            <p>
             The vast majority of what you investigators are digging up, is stuff that nearly anyone could have dug up if they had the interest and enough free time to do so. Whoever "FBIanon" might actually be, at the very least they were someone who had already done a lot of their own homework and were hoping to get a lot of people interested in looking into everything for themselves. Which means they likely had good intentions, and were also likely very strategic when it comes to understanding human nature. If they had simply dumped a bunch of information for people to look at, chances are that it would have been dismissed. But by getting people excited about digging into things for themselves, 1. they successful got a lot of people interested enough to do so, and 2. the conclusions that people draw for themselves lead to more powerful convictions, while I think most of you have seen what happens when you simply try to tell someone what to believe - it doesn't go very well.
            </p>
            <p>
             So at the very least this was a very strategic person, who had done their homework, and likely had good intentions.

              This is probably one of the most important aspects of the FBIanon threads. Like youre saying, whether the anon was actually fbi or not is irrelevant because it is evident that the anon had access to a lot of information.

             I don't know, he/she sounds quite legitimate just by the way they are talking, and they did say they thought Trump would win, and that was in July. I don't think many people thought Trump would be winning back in July.

               I saw an article saying that CIA also said no to the whole Russia helped Trump thing, and that the Washington Post was just making this story up on the basis of some shoddy partisan source saying that someone they know spoke to someone in the CIA who said they thought Putin might have hacked the US election or something along those lines.

            "Child sex abuse whistleblower resigns from UN" 
It is madness to distill it down to UK and Saudi. These are CONTINENTAL SYNDICATES. This would be a RICO investigation, if there was anyone to investigate. sigh ... 
ps. Anytime you want some free kids, follow disaster capitalism. 
This story is about Africa.

             Thanks - looks like Vatican and UN have a lot in common.
             <br/>
             Clinton Foundation involvement with UN would be interesting to track.  If I knew how.

             Can anyone else explain how we can 'follow the money' ?  We dont have access to their bank accounts or anything.  Plus, when a donation is listed, its only listed for that year, rather than a specific month.

              Nobody knows who FBIAnon was or if he was just some LARPer (i strongly believe he was real personally), but us publicly discovering who FBIAnon was would be bad as it would endanger him.

            This statement is true. Canada's intel is shit. Trust me, I know someone on the inside.  Which leads me to believe this whole convo is legit.

             Smart boy, had you mentioned 'saudi' on subject line all hell would have broke lose and CTR-MODS would have called the shill dogs to attack. For now let this OP rise in points.
            </p>
            <p>
             Saudi is a forbidden topic, this CTR owned subverse doesn't want SAUDI or AndrewKline, or David Brock mentioned.

              the Andrew Kline thing has been disproved multiple times on multiple boards.
They are different people. Stop trying to muddy the waters.

               Pretty sure this keeps going back and forth, have not done research myself to see who is right.  Someone is definitely shilling the Kline thing one way or the other.
