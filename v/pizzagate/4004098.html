             pages of google results are all devoted to debunking the picture of the two of them together and the alleged 256 emails passed between them. Lap it up, Sheep!

              Oh yeah for sure. He is a total fckin dirtbag. You can’t use google anymore it’s just a liberal search engine of trash. DuckDuckGo not much better. Hey MV - are you changing names and abbreviating because they are tracking how often we use terms and names online? Someone mentioned something about that. Do you have any details about that? Didn’t know Shittbag could be responsible for Bourdain murked. Whenever you hear of any celeb kicking off you know it’s something other than what they claim it is. Hey, speaking of Bourdain, have you seen the rants Rose McGowan has been on lately? Look at her IG posts dated August 13 and September 4 and read what she wrote. Programming is wearing off and she’s ranting. There is stuff on some other ones too about being homeless at 13, etc. Poor girls been through the ringer but she’s still on board the antichrist bus. Back to Shittbag, yeah I hadn’t heard about his screenplay that is bizarre, why would he do that? But then, he is a total creep weird creep you wouldn’t want to know personally. Definitely agree he drew from his own life experiences for his “MM murder mystery”, post holocaust of course and spy drama because he’s likely programmed as a spy. These people are almost predictable. Not that he’d write screenplays for years predictable but u get the drift.

               TS3, started abbreviating/disguising names because all these fuckin pedos have Google Alerts set up so they/their reps get a ping when we mention (type) them by name. LOL, its more helping Voat out by buying more time from trolls that attack and try to get these kinds of conversations shut down. Voat especially this sub verse, has gone dark in the past when certain topics are bought up. Because of how often Schiiitttts name in particular, is Snoped + Dubunked from Google, his peeps would try to get this type of thread shut down too, for sure. I don’t know how accurate I’m being here, my friend

               . I do know of other gossip websites that are targeted by PRs + Handlers to try and get certain threads removed and they almost always are. Kinda pissed. There was some great juice a while back someplace, on the M@rkle grifter about how her ho mom Dori$, pimped her out as a kid but would only let client/friends ‘enter her anally’ as that didn’t constitute CP in her mind. Thread was deleted after an hour. Sometimes OPs get scared too and don’t want to doxx themselves.

               LOL I love Rose McG. Another media pimp mama ho. Made a whole bunch of $$$ from Abuse stories, demands five/six figure sums for all appearances, quotes. Gotta hand it to the kid tho, grew up in a

              </p>
              <p>
               The Truth has been shared since The Beginning. These are only a few points and basic questions for any who dispute it.
              </p>
              <blockquote>
               <p>
                The entire election is riding on one district: Racine, Wisconsin.
               </p>
               <p>
                It is the key pivot district in the key swing state. Right before Kenosha happened Nancy Pelosi said:
               </p>
               <p>
                ”No pressure, it’s all riding on Wisconsin. No pressure.”
               </p>
               <p>
                There are 3 pivot districts in Wisconsin: Racine, Kenosha and Sauk.
               </p>
               <p>
                How did they rig the April primary to pass a billion dollar referendum linking experimental COVID testing and tracing programs with Weill Cornell and Common Core, Community Health, Community Policing and Smart City models in one location?
               </p>
               <p>
                How did they also rig the recount? Who controls the money and “expectations” for the referndum and who controls the courts (his “wife”)?
               </p>
               <p>
                Why was this removed from GreatAwakening and why can’t you say anything about Racine without being targeted, censored, banned and hreatened?
               </p>
               <p>
                When others claim there is nothing to see, can any of them dispute The Truth in these questions?
               </p>
               <p>
                Racine is not the COVID testing community for Weill Cornell?
               </p>
               <p>
                It isn’t a major hub for human trafficking?
               </p>
               <p>
                Common Core was not established there as part of the World Core Curriculum?
               </p>
               <p>
                It is not a nationwide model for Community Policing endorsed by the Clintons?
               </p>
               <p>
                Joe Biden didn’t endorse a rigged billion dollar referendum in April for Racine?
               </p>
               <p>
                Nancy Pelosi didn’t say before the Kenosha riots that is is “all riding on Wisconsin. No pressure.”?
               </p>
               <p>
                Jeff Neubauer didn’t run Bill Clinton’s Presidential campaign in Wisconsin?
               </p>
               <p>
                His sister isn’t the vampire star of True Blood well embedded into Scientology?
               </p>
               <p>
                Samantha Marq is not friends with Paris Hilton and the now deceased stars of Glee?
               </p>
               <p>
                The NXIVM doctor’s family doesn’t live there?
               </p>
               <p>
                The historic Knights of Pythias parade didn’t happen there?
               </p>
               <p>
                Art in Embassies wasn’t established with major contributions from Racine collections?
               </p>
               <p>
                The Majestic 12 didn’t have more members from Wisconsin?
               </p>

             These monsters get let off lightly. These lists should be circulated and plastered
             <strong>
              EVERYWHERE
             </strong>
             . Let their friends, families, voters, churchgoers, everyone see and know who these fuckers are, not just the famous ones like Wiener or Po1anski.
