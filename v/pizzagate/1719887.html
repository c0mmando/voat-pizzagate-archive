             This was a few years ago, i see a lot of people posting stuff now, but yeah. It is crazy - all i did was take pictures from my window. What's crazy is for them to try and pull a covert operation that's so blatantly obvious! And then just terrorize anyone who tries to state the obvious!

            While it may be true that its easier at the moment to bust them for tax evasion, its on the slippery slope of normalization. IRS penalties are largely financial, that plays into the Satanic system heavily.

            What the fuck man what the hell is wrong with these fucking people. Then we have vault7 and they have the ability to soy on everything and everyone but NEVER apprehend the big dogs behind this shit? We are honestly enslaved by truly evil and wicked people and its not a joke anymore it is real. To have all that technology at their disposal means to me they know of these things and do nothing about it but lock civilians away for petty offences to generate revenue? Something has truly gone wrong with the state of the world.
           </p>
           <p>
            No wonder people hate america everything is a lie. Maybe others have known the truth far longer about the deep state of america etc while we are being told haters of america are "jelous" of our freedom and we are the good guys.
           </p>
           <p>
            If this is what government is might as well have anarchy.
           </p>
           <p>
            The thing is professors top ceos etc MOST of the time have a "pecuiler" nature about them. They didnt get where they are because they worked for it they got their because they secretley partake in these evils and perversions.
           </p>
           <p>
            This blows me away because a few years ago the ceo of the company i was working for presented himself and there was this talk of pizza and I thought nothing of it at the time but it was a group of high corporate white men standing in a circle talking about the company. Then the conversation changed and the way they were looking at each other and grimacing and snickering when speaking of pizza and how "the wife doesnt need to know" and other things.
           </p>
           <p>
            These fraternities and golf clubs and secret societies build upon much greater perversity and evil.
           </p>
           <p>
            It sounds dramatic but these revelations are so sad and heartbreaking about the true nature of this country that I feel like my mind is melting from disgust. I feel like nobody gives a damn but me and its driving me crazy like how the fuck can people just sleep easy at night etc knowing our government is complicet in these dealings?
           </p>
           <p>
            People march figh kill and put their life on the line over the most mundane bullshit why the hell has their not been an uprising? japan and egypt have toppled governments for far less.
           </p>
           <p>
            Maybe the stereotype of fat lazy egotystical unsympathetic people is true for americans. I just dont see how the people aware of this shit are the minority This is pissing me off thats why sadly I had to stop coming to this site because it just makes me angry im going 2 bed.
           </p>
           <p>
            Morality has become irrelevant and nothing seems to matter to anybody anymore I hope they all fucking die for what they did to those children its not entirely their fault though part of it is ours for allowing ourselves to become slaves. Ill do a prayer tonight because I feel like believing in a god. I need to believe some force out there greater then man will correct these evils and that some force greater than us will punish these men when they leave the physical plane.
           </p>
           <p>
            I dont want to believe that anybody can elude justice gof if you are real please do something about this is getting to out of hand, Its just breaking my fuckign heart to read this shit it really is I cant stand it anymore It wouldnt hurt so much if I felt something could be done about it it makes you question so much, Everything has been lie literally EVERYTHING.

             I'm with you. I can't sleep at night. I cry all the time. I keep praying, because that's all I can do anymore. I do have a story. Outside my house last week someone burned 3 candles, 3 different colors, in the woods. My son came home at 12:30 at night and saw the flame. He woke me up and we went out there but no one was there. I put out the flames so it wouldn't burn down the woods. I called the police the next day when I saw the candle wax, they sent a cruiser by. He said it was a Somalian cult- the Santa Maria cult? And that was a warning to someone that has done them wrong. I am a white, American female. We might have some Somalians in the neighborhood, but why near my house?? I've been investigating and researching the Pedogate and Pizzagate stuff for some time. I wonder if i am being targeted? Is this how deep it goes? I'm hoping I'm just paranoid. This has to end. We have to stop this evil, because it's real. Please stay safe everyone......

             You've just described my state of mind every day.
            </p>
            <p>
             I believe that the complacency is as simple as this:
            </p>
            <p>
             EVERYONE has a connection to pedophilia. So many people are afraid. Afraid that they'll be accused or outed. Afraid that their spouse will turn out to be a pedophile; or parent, child, or religious leader.
            </p>
            <p>
             We are afraid that we'll have to tell our mentally unstable mother that the trusted church elder molested us as he drove us to Sunday school; or tell our father that his brother molested us when we were five years old.
            </p>
            <p>
             Afraid that people will view us differently or not believe us, at all. Or afraid that we won't be able to help a victim who comes to us.
            </p>
            <p>
             This disease grips the entire world in fear; and it will take nothing short of a massive group movement of heroism to take it down. We'd have to start civilization from scratch and accept the loss of people we currently love and trust.
            </p>
            <p>
             It's a whole lot easier to take the kids to Disney and share pictures of your lunch or dogs on Facebook; and pretend like it doesn't exist.

             I hear ya and I know exactly what your going through.. however Im sadly also not trusting justice will be served beyond this physical plane.. Ive been researching all this for 25+ years now, covering every angle.. looking to understand what the hecks going on on this planet.. My conclusions are not great.. ive become quite cynical.. it seems this whole place is run from human emotions.. its like we are a farm of drama.. and the birth and death cycle is just part of it..what i mean is it doesnt stop after death.. The moon wasnt always here.. there are ancient legends of the pre moon time.. where things were much nicer here.. animals didnt have to kill each other to survive and no war etc.. I leave you with this article to ponder.. and look further.. its all about not going to the light!
I am seriously done with this planet and all the shit thats going on here.. its been going on for thousands and thousands of years.. Human sacrifice and blood letting, drama creation and farming our emotions of fear as food (loosh).. none of this is new AND...
The same frigging characters keep coming back again and again playing the same roles over and over .. the "good" and the "bad" guys.. you and me and them.. we all keep coming back like the suckers we are (have been, not me anymore).. getting told we have a "mission" to complete, souls to save or even just the excuse of OH, your having a nice rest in the next life, an easy ride for a change, and so on and so on.. any excuse to get ya back.. meanwhile you hang out in an astral plane illusion until your ready to come back to this illusion.. they got astral plane "heavens" made up for everyone, for every religion, and every spirits preferences.. But our true HOME lies beyond all of this and all these planes and spaces of creational dimensions. Seek out your own true light of home..
Read this article below and if it resonates then it might open a whole new field of possibility and also scary shit! Cause it ain't over when your body dies...

              "It ain't over when your body dies" - it's actually funny what an understatement this is. I had a massive accident and died, multiple times. When the string to the physical world gets cut, that's when you really come alive - we're so asleep in these bodies, with our little story line constantly playing in our brains, it's almost like we're drunk infants. Our consciousness, when freed from this world, becomes almost as large as God. I say almost because it seems infinite, and you feel as if you know/remember EVERYTHING, yet at the same time you are clearly a student, with the Creator, the source of Love, as the Father/teacher. (I think one reason perhaps that God has become known as "He" is the booming Voice you hear, like the sound of bass when it rattles your cells - that's what ti's like when the voice of God passes through you, not feminine at all ;)

             You're not alone in your disgust, outrage and anger. Most of us "awake" people here all feel the same way. I've had sleepless nights at first and it was difficult for me to "Go on", knowing that I couldn't do a single thing about it except pray and try and help investigators here. It is heart-wrenching to have to come to terms with the fact that children are being raped, tortured and killed and that most people don't know that this suffering and agony is going on every minute of every hour of every day. It pisses me off beyond belief.
We are at war. It's a spiritual war. And our mission is first and foremost to educate and wake up the unaware masses. When enough people have woken up, change will happen. We are making progress everyday. Don't give up hope. Count your blessings everyday, persevere, tough it out and rush on. We need to do this for the children. They need us. We're all they've got.

               It's unfortunately always a possibility. Some will get away with it, others won't. This evil obviously can't be completely eradicated. But it doesn't matter. If we can prevent it from happening at the same rate and slow it down, then it's a good thing. We have to be able to accept whatever small victories and progress we make along the way without expecting the impossible. It's a very long and arduous process and only the most tenacious and patient of investigators and concerned citizens will be able to fully witness and enjoy the fruits of our efforts. Many will, along the way, tire, get distracted, get pulled away, or simply drop out. So it's imperative that we continue to wake people up and invite them over to get them involved. We need people to take over the investigation when we feel we need a break.

             many people are working very hard to make sure some action happens due to these sorts of revelations. Just think - before pizzagate we weren't even talking about this, even though it's been going on forever. I had to watch the Franklin case get covered up, forgotten, I watched the Hampstead case covered up, never discussed... So for me the fact that we are dedicated to keeping this information at the forefront this time is a really good sign.
            </p>
            <p>
             But I know your pain. When I heard the Hampstead  children's testimonies, I was all alone. No one even from my church would listen or watch, I had no one to discuss it with, and clearly nothing would be done since no one would talk about it. The knowledge of what they'd been through just festered inside me until pizzagate came out. And now I'm not so alone in my disgust.
            </p>
            <p>
             I believe we've reached the tipping point. And from what I understand, there are multiple investigations ongoing into this. It's been going on forever, it won't be healed overnight or this year. But we are making huge progress even by just talking about it, and being willing to face the truth that these children have to face.

              they need to do SOMETHING publicly though.  this is taking too long.  we don't know for certain what's happening behind the scenes.  i'm trying my hardest to be patient, but then there are days like today, where I'm just furious and the patience isn't there

               Yep. A LOT of people are sounding like you these days. I had a good day yesterday, but most days I sound like you too, ever since late January when it became apparent Trump wasn't the great warrior we hoped for.

             Professorship is an extremely cushy gig. Good pay. Close to no work. Can't get fired. A dominant position to women just coming into their sexuality. It's like being a rock star with none of the talent or hard work

            This statement is a vast oversimplification which makes it false.
           </p>
           <p>
            I have known several very good, devoted and phenomenal professors who work daily to enrich the life of their students, and like any job, it isn't an easy one if it is done with heart and professionalism.
           </p>
           <p>
            Generalizing like this is where the idea of witchhunt starts, and I deplore seeing it.

            "All car mechanics are con men"
"The only dentists are failed doctors, and they are all depressed sadists."
"Who would want to be a teacher unless they were a letch for kids?"
"Every preacher is a wolf out to fleece his flock of sheep."
"Stewardesses are just in the job to land a husband from the wealthy travelers they meet."

            I could go on and on and on.  Are you comfortable being labeled a bigot?  If so, keep at it.  Otherwise you may want to look at your assumptions.  Labeling large population groups with generalizations is a lazy way to think.

             Look at what he said and what you repeated. He claimed it's a cushy job. (It is.) He claimed it had good pay. (It does.) He said there's close to no work. (That's debatable.) He said you can't get fired. (Tenure.)
            </p>
            <p>
             He said this was a good job. Federal judge fits the bill, too. You chose to interpret these perks as abuses. The reasons he stated are why people actually become professors. The scenarios you painted are much darker.

             Jeez, man... that's quite a generalization there. Should we hold Aristotle responsible for categorizations?

             The label was: professor is a desirable job. That's true.

            Thanks for bringing to our attention this incredible, devoted wortk on the part of Lori Handrahan.  I don't know how she has the constitution to deal with these stories as she does.   What a service to do because it just puts that spotlight right on the faces crimes and criminally light sentencing of these otherwise seemingly ordinary people.  It seems like these people get handslapped and no therapy or any counter abuse work at all and they are then just loose, with no job out there in the world to offend again in who knows what way.
           </p>
           <p>
            This brings home to me how really sick our culture is, and how we are not treating this illness, nor respecting the victims rights at all.  It is like having a terrible cancer and being in total denial of it.
           </p>
           <p>
            Is this phenomenon the death knell of American culture?

             Did you hear Putin's address at Christmas? (Now I wonder if this is why he's suddenly "enemy number one". He pretty much says that this phenomenon is indeed the downfall of the U.S.

              Yes. I've watched that Putin address more than once. That man is watching carefully and is very aware of what's going on. I wish we had him as Prime Minister instead of the empty-shell, clown, Trudeau we have right now (sigh).

               I would rather him as our leader too. At least we wouldn't have to wonder if our food is real or not. Putin banned GMO's and Monsanto from his country. And those of us who identify as Christian wouldn't have to feel like hiding that fact.

                Really? I didn't know that he banned GMO's and Monsanto from Russia. That is amazing! If so, then Chemtrails are probably not aloud either there. Ah! How I wish I could grow my own organic vegetables under clear blue skies!

                 That's a brilliant point! I am SURE he wouldn't allow them, plus they're foreign, unregistered aircraft and would be shot down immediately. It's funny, i never see pictures of Russia, but i'm going to look for them now, and check out the sky. There's no WAY he'd allow it. I know, i ache for that '70's sky i grew up with, that made everything so colorful. Now the sky is silver/white and everything is a muted greysih version of its former self. Notice that commercials have just adopted this as if it's a new fashion: all whited out and milky, only muted colors, nothing vivid except maybe their red lettering. Sometimes i watch old shitty TV shows just to enjoy the natural sun, the sharp shadows, and the brilliant colors.

                  How lovely those skies were way back when. I miss them too. We have to keep fighting and spreading the word around for the sake of our children and grandchildren. We can't stay quiet about the air we breathe. It must be stopped..!

            Agreed on the cushy aspect... but, I know 3 people that went on to become college professors and are all in their 30's... one of them is active on Voat. Certainly not a statistically significant sample, but, becoming a professor is not a "long shot". Becoming a top politician, CEO, head of a non-profit however? The odds are exponentially smaller.

            Not sure how to ask this, hopefully you all will know what i'm referring to - in the earlier days of
            <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/v/pizzagate">
             v/pizzagate
            </a>
            there were posts related to the systemic, all pervasive phenomenon of pedogate: that it has the practice of satanism at its core, the binding factor, and includes child trafficking, rape, torture and murder. Ted Gunderson certainly attested to this, and died for it. There were others who claim this too (detailed in past submissions). They say it involves all levels - to the very top of DC obviously, down to the local school board and police depts, city council etc.
           </p>
           <p>
            If you're 'in the club' and compromised by your pedophilia, you get good positions, or you don't loose your business. If you don't play along, the latter can happen, or you simply don't get that job you wanted.
           </p>
           <p>
            So I wonder if all these professors are a symptom of this very thing?

             I can't imagine someone would sell their soul for a position that can be semi-easily obtained... high spectrum politicians, musicians, actors, businessmen, heads of state, heads of NGO's with invisible budgets, etc... these positions of power/influence/wealth make sense to have a blackmail "control" mechanism in place.

             Teachers and Professors? I don't want to sound cold, but, my assumption is that the criminals that hold these titles are more inline with religious leaders that participate in the same crime. Not drawn by power or fame, but simply the presence of their victims.

               Agreed. I'm not arguing that this isn't happening - only that the blackmail/symptom/victim loop scenario may be less likely in the education and religion arenas.

                There are many questions... some aspects we've covered more than others - this is an area that needs more research, in my opinion.

             In this instance I DO mean to sound cold... why even waste tax dollars on these vile humans? They'll do it again. And as we've seen, the prison sentences are disturbingly light and there seems to even be methods used to remove oneself from the registry.

             One bullet per convicted pedophile.
            </p>
            <p>
             This "one bullet" policy applies specifically to adults praying on victims in a systematic, planned and calculated fashion. Such a harsh penalty wouldn't be appropriate for a 20 or 30 year old in a relationship with a 17 year old. While this is still illegal, I think a maximum age should be set for capital punishment - as this is a wholly different scenario. Unless that 17 year old is taken against their will and there is kidnapping and/or torture involved. Then I'd say it's fair to put the option back on the table.

              The sex drive is a tremendous force within the human psyche.  Once perverted, it becomes a tremendous force working against both the individual and society.
             </p>
             <p>
              You see it time and time again; people obviously capable of realizing the gravity of their actions, yet work against themselves by taking outrageous chances to satisfy their lusts.  Harsher penalties might be a deterrent to those who have yet to take that step beyond, but most aren't aware of that line, and it would do nothing to deter those who are fully entrapped.  The best argument in favor of the death penalty would be as an act of mercy towards those who've wholly corrupted the integrity of their being.
             </p>
             <p>
              It would also be a statement that society values its children over the lives of degenerates.

            Our Schools our becoming infested with these perverted rapists.  I don't have proof, but would not be surprised if they have been inserted to continue creating more pedophiles.  Remember there are good teachers still in school, but with less money and less teachers things are stretched to the limit and they are busy as heck.  I believe when their guard and the guard of the parent helpers are down due to fatigue, the others get away with their disgusting heinous acts. Parents are busy working too, and pay less attention.  This is a big problem, imo.
