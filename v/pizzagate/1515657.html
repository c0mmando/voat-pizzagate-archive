            Good stuff from Steele, maybe not all of it correct but then again who is? The part about the FBI sounds reasonable seeing as Hoover was such a pervert. We do need a complete overhaul of all of these intelligence agencies if not an outright dismantling, I too am a pissed off patriot who is neither Republican or Democrat, we desperately need an end to these two parties as well. It's a tall mountain to climb but it starts with the first step, we can only hope Trump makes a stab at it and they don't kill him when he does.

            This reaks of controlled opposition to me. At this point, every insider and redpilled soul out there knows the corruption is going to start being exposed starting 26 days from now. I think they have finally gotten past the denial stage and are working on limiting damage to the most crucial agencies, programs, and people of the globalist agenda. They'll retreat to the shadows, lick their wounds, and then come back smarter and wiser.

            This letter does a lot of finger pointing and blaming, yet look at who isn't being blamed: the CIA and the Federal Reserve.
           </p>
           <p>
            The CIA has repeatedly and willingly committed every atrocity and human rights violation known to man. They all deserve to hang.
           </p>
           <p>
            This guy tries to come off sounding like an economic policy expert and then gives some  [bad] advice on how to try to fix the economy before the impending collapse. Well, anybody with even a rudimentary understanding knows that there is only one possible outcome of a debt - based economy run by a private central bank. It ends in collapse, every single time. Inflation rises out of control because you have to print more money to pay the interest on the interest on the interest on the interest... These people will never even entertain the idea of ending the Fed because it puts trillions of dollars straight into the pockets of a small group of faceless, trillionaire banking families. Having our economy dependant on the Federal Reserve is like building  a skyscraper on quicksand and then constantly trying to build new floors faster than it is sinking into the sand.
           </p>
           <p>
            There are also other aspects of our government that have been completely corrupted yet are not mentioned in this letter,such as the DoJ and the State Dept.
           </p>
           <p>
            Screw this guy, for being a supposed former CIA agent, he sure doesn't know much. I don't trust him one bit.

            I had a Grandfather who was sort of high up in law enforcement. I vividly remember that whenever someone mentioned the CIA he would give a sort of
            <em>
             harrumph
            </em>
            .
           </p>
           <p>
            It was my feeling even as a child, that even though he never said it in so many words, (not within my earshot, anyway) that he had a deep disgust for them.
           </p>
           <p>
            I wish he was alive because besides missing him, I would LOVE to see what he'd have to say about all of this!

            Wow I can't believe I actually read that whole thing.  Thanks for posting.  I like the author's take on Trump being an "accidental" president.  Just really think about that.  The globalists had an accident happen.  Like a game of Chess, where it's the globalists vs the people. They were looking for the checkmate when Hillary got elected.  They were SO close.  Their pieces were all moving into place.  But as fate would have it, an accident of epic proportions occurred, and the people were given like 3 free moves.    Trump gets elected, Wikileaks spreads massive truths, and alt-media becomes the more trusted source of information.  Their sure victory now sits much further distance.   This letter makes some well thought out cases as to where Trump should move his next pieces, to move that victory even further out.

             it wasn't an accident. hillary was a terrible candidate. Anybody picked randomly from the phone book would have beat trump, but she had to be the one. She cheated against Bernie, the leaks happened, the lynch plane incident, the health issues, the comey letters, none of that was accidental...Anybody picked randomly out of the phone book could have beat Hillary, if the primary wasn't rigged, we'd have Bernie.

              Yes HIllary was a bad candidate, absolutely.  The accident though was this:  by bucking the two party system which is in effect what Trump and the people did, an anomaly was allowed in the system.  Something that shouldn't be.

              He ran republican, but how much rep support did he really have?  The 2-party system is really two sides of the same coin, right?  The outsider/outlier prevailed.  He snuck in as republican, but as a rino as far as its ties to the RNC go.  How could the powers that be allow their position of "queen" to be captured, which is what the position of a POTUS could be likened to in a global game of chess.
             </p>
             <p>
              This guy in the paper posted by OP has a good explanation for the phenomenon.  For those who didn't read, he suggests Trump quickly change the electoral process to ensure 3rd party candidates have any kind of chance in the future.  The current system is set up to preserve and protect the 2-party system, which is why nothing ever changes.

               I don't think this guy is ex cia. I didn't read his whole letter, but it started out sounding like a manic rant, that i couldn't take it seriously.  But also, the podsta emails show that the H campaign was asking MSM to push trump over the RNC-appoved candidates, so Trump didn't just sneak in, Hill wasn't going to beat any of the others, she needed Trump to knock them out. She didn't count on being less acceptable to voters than Trump. I don't see it as an accident, (its the word accident that i object to) I see it as super pisspoor bad judgment and being such a bad candidate that she deserved to lose. Those who had been gaming the system underestimated their ability to manipulate the vote.

             This would have naturally occurred even if hillary had won.. As technology progresses, it by nature forces out the old and obsolete ways of doing things.. This trend of alternative media becoming dominate and old traditional MSM becoming obsolete will continue until there is no more MSM..

             I've not ready to completely blindly trust Trump, but I'm not going to throw him under the bus yet. Will watch him with a close eye during the first year of his presidency, and be ready to speak out if need be... BUT, this could be a big moment in history, we shall see soon enough.

               Ever heard of Ray McGovern? He is proof that there are good guys in the CIA. But I still think it needs to be dismantled, too much water under that bridge.

I have  also  heard  of (what's the  guy who ran  a short  wave  program, predicted  9/11, was set  up  and  killed  by  the local cops?) but I can't say I trust them-they are limited  hangouts at  best, Luciferian child torturers at  their worst (can you tell me why we have Navy Seals and Aquino is still breathing???)

            Excellent letter. I especially agree on point #3 that Trump should avoid the Legacy Mockingbird Media entirely. Newt Gingrich made essentially this same point on Fox a couple of weeks ago

             he already is the the 1st PEOTUS that speaks directly to the people through twitter - I love the idea of turning the press room into a studio, but that I assure you it will lead to propaganda issues with the left.

             But I think he also needs to take Newt's input with a strong second opinion.  He is the one who came out this week and alluded to the point that Trump said he isn't going to drain the swamp after all, and he did not say that.
