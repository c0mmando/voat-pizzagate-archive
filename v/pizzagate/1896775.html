<blockquote>
<p>Q. Going through JP twitter but found nothing on the day Rich was killed, also couple of days before and after. What time frame should we look into?</p>
<p>A. Image - Podesta bus - <a href="https://imgtc.com/1PEA5AG">https://imgtc.com/1PEA5AG</a> there you go... look into SEIU hangouts around where Seth was murdered.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I\'ve been looking into the &quot;Podesta bus&quot; picture posted by NonFBIAnon, and it originated in a Tweet by John Podesta on May 29, 2015, where he is dressed in a red t-shirt picturing woman\'s dress with a pearl necklace (?). He tweets:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Ready to accessorize? <a href="http://hrc.io/1eDlzSw">http://hrc.io/1eDlzSw</a> </p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="http://archive.is/GXOAX">http://archive.is/GXOAX</a></p>
<p>It was only after reading the comments that I realized his t-shirt was of a woman\'s outfit. Initially, I thought it was a pizza deliveryman costume. I wasn\'t the only one to think so, judging by comments. The link he gives is to the Hillary campaign\'s web store.</p>
<p>A few days after the Tweet, a fawning Washington Post article came out, describing how the thrifty John Podesta decreed that staffers must take bus rides to commute from NY to Washington. The reporter glowingly details how the humble Podesta stands in line with a duffle bag of laundry and sits with the common people and rarely sees high-powered Washington people on his commutes.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2015/06/09/how-cheap-is-hillary-clintons-campaign-this-cheap/">https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2015/06/09/how-cheap-is-hillary-clintons-campaign-this-cheap/</a>?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The $30 bus fare on Vamoose is about a third of the cheapest Amtrak train ticket, and is less than the taxes alone on a coach seat on the NY-DC shuttle plane flight — which is why Clinton campaign manager Robby Mook (who proudly tells staffers and donors alike that he [Podesta] is “really, really cheap,” as in second-hand furniture and no-cab-rides cheap), has decreed that staffers must schlep back and forth between Washington and New York on the bus.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>(Interestingly enough, this WaPo article is the origin of the line: &quot;Usually cheerful, Podesta has a profane alter ego nicknamed Skippy you don’t want to meet&quot;.)</p>
<p>In the article, Podesta claimed the low-frills commute has built team spirit among his campaign staff. &quot;Ever the leader&quot; John Podesta conceived the idea of  posting a cardboard bus in the Brooklyn Clinton HQ with the names of bus-riding staffers as a way to honor them:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A cheap bus ride has become an inside joke and something of a merit badge for Clinton staffers, many of whom commute frequently for meetings and other work in Washington. There is a hand-lettered, bus-shaped honor roll on the wall at the campaign’s Brooklyn headquarters, listing those who have eschewed cushier train or plane rides customary for business travel.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The reporter is careful to note that, although there is a luxury bus available for the NY-Washington commute, &quot;As the most senior staffer, the ascetic Podesta embodies the new campaign’s tightfisted ethos&quot; and </p>
<blockquote>
<p>For the record, the fancier Vamoose Gold Bus — with leather seats and bottled water — is off limits at $60 a ticket.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>However, a quick look through the Podesta Wikileaks emails reveals quite the contrary. John Podesta takes the luxury Vamoose Gold Bus from Bethesda, MD, to NYC many times. Sample emails below:</p>
<p><a href="https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/16375">https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/16375</a></p>

<p>Favorable Twitter reactions to the WaPo article from  Podesta\'s friends were collected by his secretary and sent to him in this email:</p>

<p>How this relates to Seth Rich\'s murder is not clear at this time, although it does reveal that Podesta is disingenuous about taking the economy commute.</p>

            A good opportunity for the journalists to meet Skippy, so he can Show them Hillarys America. The Podesta bus is definitely a PR stunt from the Clinton camp, so they can show how "hard-working" and human they are in their News-letter when begging for mutch needed donations. And we do know that these people like multi-tasking, so what more then interviews did Skippy give the journalists?

            There was an extremely intriguing and interesting thread on 4Chan a couple of hours ago, looked like some anon posting info. I know, you
            <em>
             were

            saying you hoped for more clues, G ; )
           </p>
           <p>
            TONNES of clues here, the hottest yet.
           </p>
           <p>
            OP mentions the Mook Mafia and this abc article mentioned above. Lots of PG clues and revelations too,

            Thanks for the link: "Copies of a cache of the emails obtained by ABC News, and revealed publicly for the first time, show Mook and Marshall demonstrating an aggressive tone in rallying their friends behind political causes, in exchanges that are often self-mocking and sometimes border on being profane.
           </p>
           <p>
            They include rallying cries to, in Mook’s words,
            <strong>
             “smite Republicans mafia-style,”
            </strong>
            and, to quote Marshall, “punish those voters.” Mook sometimes calls himself “Deacon” in the emails, while Marshall, now a senior White House aide, refers to himself as “Reverend” in many of the exchanges."
Rhetorical question: I wonder if the "smiting mafia-style" applied to leakers like Seth Rich and brings to mind the JP communication about making an example of suspected leakers. When was that JP email? That email was part of the Wikileaks dump, IIRC.

            Well the timing fits for a coded message to the troops to prepare for the assassination and subsequent well orchestrated coverup. It's not proof that this is the message he intended, but certainly is consistent, IMO.
