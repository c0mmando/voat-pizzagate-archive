<p>Here is a good article on Burning Man Wikileaks and its connection to pizzagate. Written by a disgruntled or dissident insider/muckraker.</p>
<p>I was there in 2007 when Addis burned the Man early.  It was very strange on many levels, and my naturally conspiratorial mind connected some dots.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The signs leading up to the entrance gates spoke of jaded burners who had seen it all, but they haven\'t seen nothin yet type of shit.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There was a playa-wide rumor of a massive party at the trash fence, so most attendees were far from the Man Monday night when Addis torched it.  Safety third!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The scene was instantly cordoned off and a new Man was built in no time.  This is an art piece, should have been unique, but they had a double complete with neon tubes and everything.  No burners were allowed near it, frustratating many volunteer minded folks.  Burners love to help and donate supplies, and it was weird being disallowed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It always seemed strange to me that Addis was treated like a murderer or something but got off with a misdemeanor. I guess this wikileaks explains some of that, they tried to prosecute as felony arson.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Instantly, factions emerged pro Addis, and death to Addis.  I learned then that generating a social scene was the REAL ART MEDIUM, not paint on canvas or sculpted bronze or wood.  No, the formation of these masses of people thinking and feeling what you want to make them think and feel-- that\'s what artist Addis was sculpting.  FAKE NEWS.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Conclusion: I think the early burn was a curated art happening , BMorg knew and condoned it.</p>
<p>Burning Man has been completely co-opted by the rich and political.  It\'s interesting watching the whole thing collapse as elite playground camps like White Ocean get sabotaged.  I haven\'t gone since 2010, the police presence was just oppressive as fuck.</p>
<p>Anyways, I saw some rant on here about burning man beng a satanic festival with kids in the Man etc and wanted to clarify.  I do like how burners.me gives a fair account of pizzagate and burning man. Worth a read.</p>',

            Here is what I think about burning man tiday, and why I th8no it is relevant, besides this article explicitly discussing pizzagate and NAMBLA.
           </p>
           <p>
            Politicians and elites have co opted the hippie participant nature of the event in order to play with it as some type of social engineering think tank human experimentation Petri dish.
           </p>
           <p>
            As the article states, some are using it to further a lawless pirate state, "a pedophile dream".  The article goes on to state a number of child incidents.  I could add two more.  A member of the burned rockstar group Mutaytor was nabbed by Chris Hanson and Perverted Justice.  I discovered the NAMBLA connection at that time, and almost boycotted going, but instead went I a local event and met such awesome people I overrode that because supposedly NAMBLA was 86ed.  Anyhow...I also know a young lady who was seduced by a much older burner dude who trafficked her across state lines him to Nevada where she met the age of consent. This same young lady was exploited by another person in the community.  Two more underage girls I know were groomed and seduced by burner men at house parties.  Shit is real, and even though there are plenty of amazing people good to their core, who are activists and rangers.  But the "Radical Inclusion" principle is basically a terrible social fallacy because it makes it really hard to expell sexual predators from one's intimate social scene.
           </p>
           <p>
            Burner friendships tend to be very intense, often called "tribe" and "chosen family". So it really hurts in a spiritual abuse or domestic violence sort of way when someone in the community turns out to be an evildoer.  It is taking a long time for diehards to recognize the corruption.
           </p>

               Thanks.  I just saw today that Peter Theil tweeted that he was going to the burn in 2015...maybe I will search for various persons of interest + burning man.  Now that it's been utterly co-opted by these parasites, I belief they use it to farm "loosh" so to speak.  That event has extreme levels of human energy, and these people want to extract it like they stripmine or clear cut.

                 One I know of broke away and isn't a decompression anymore, people do call it a regional but I don't know if it technically is under the BMorg....
                </p>
                <p>
                 That one has gotten massive, and has kinda small minded control freaks running things, but I haven't heard of any shenanigans with the accounting. Just greed and ego.
                </p>
                <p>
                 I've attended others that keep it small and cozy. As cheap and accessible as possible, with size caps.

                 The regional model definitely seems to have the potential for abuse if run by a nasty person

                  omg the cliquish nature of some of the regionals is pretty astounding. I heard of one where the property owner completely wiped the board because of their egos and abusive bullshit.

                 <p>
                  So what's your take on it being a shitty cult? Who is the effigy burned to? An intoxicated mass gleefully giving up their energy toward the burning of an effigy built by people in hoods who conduct a whole ceremony for the ritual... to what end?

                   Cliquishness, certainly.  "Radical Inclusion" is basically a social fallacy.  You can't, nor should, include every person no matter what, because some people are toxic.  Either just when interacting with a clique, or just general predators and creeps toxicity.
                  </p>

                   As Outtrim explains in his YouTube series, it's a cult of no religion. Larry Harvey loves to say, "It's a self service cult. You have to wash your own brain."  I listened to episode 4 yesterday, it explains so much.

                   I personally have never seen hooded figures or devil worship. Just freaks and geeks love bombing everyone.  It is a blissful and transcendent feeling being on the playa with thousands of friends you haven't met yet.  Outtrim explains in the link above how this is laboratory grade cia mind control.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   I recently went to an informal burn in the desert, and asked my friends why they burn the man. Most of them had inspirational tales of love, light, and renewal.  Like a Phoenix myth.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   But like I said, Outtrim has removed the veil from my eyes, and I can see now that the nagging thoughts I have about BM not being upfront have a basis in fact.  The Borg only cares to assimilate us.

                    Never heard of Outtrim, I'll look that up. Also, Youtube seems to be down for me at the moment but I'll give that a look when it's back up.
