            Okay, so I'm revisiting my thread here after a few months away and none of the slimg links are working. It doesn't 404 or anything like that, but the pages/images seem stuck in a "loading" status.
           </p>
           <p>
            Has anyone had any problems with slimg recently? I don't want to jump to conclusions about my stuff being sabotaged somehow, but I'm really not sure what to think.

            I just wanted to add this after an anon on /pol/ found a shitload of adoption agencies with similar pedo logos: According to his FB, Gross started working at the Aleph Institute earlier this year. They have a program that sponsors summer camp for Jewish kids whose parents are incarcerated. Here's the link:

           <ul>
            <li>
             The butterfly logos, especially the one flying away from the phrase "partnership opportunities"; In the Flash movie at the top, the butterfly actually flies around and flaps its wings a few times after it lands

            <li>
             The way the word "DONATE" is emphasized by itself toward the top of the page, separate from the word "now." It almost comes off like ((((((DONATE)))))) now
            </li>
            <li>
             The image of the boy holding the oar next to the caption, "Best summer of my life."; Literally all the images

            Sunbiz.org is the best way to research FL corporations.

            Searching "FRAPES LLC" produces

             this bizarre page
            </a>
            . Is a Frape a real thing, or is this one of those secret squirrel sites? My cynical mind makes me believe that it's a play on "Florida Rapes".
Wish I could dig deeper. Maybe you'll find something more on this?

             Yeah, I've been wondering about the name "Frapes." Unfortunately, I haven't been able to find much of anything on it. The address is one of the same ones associated with Pizza Packet that goes to some office building, which is no surprise. I'm wondering what it's even for. Googling "frapes," I've found that it's a common term for posting things on someone else's Facebook page without their permission, like when a friend leaves himself logged in on your computer or something. "Facebook rape" = frape. Whatever he's doing with Frapes, LLC, it doesn't seem to have an "above ground" presence.

            Interesting. I've never seen a "barred-in" community like that. What the hell would be the purpose of that? What stood out to me was the man on the sidewalk who has a child with him and pretty clearly seems to be shielding the child's face from the Google maps truck.

             Because they're chareidi and hate technology, and unfamiliar intruders in their neighbourhood. Just because there are chareidi pedophiles doesn't mean all are. Chareidim avert their gaze for everything. They won't even look at women. 
Also, the neighbourhood isn't barred in, it's one apartment complex.

             edit: he's not even shielding, he's walking.
further edit: based on the fact that he's wearing a tie, it's a chag, so he doesn't want to have his photo taken as it breaks the shabbos.

            I was looking into the Hasidic Jewish community and their rates of underage sex crimes. I learned that Williamsburg in Brooklyn is dominated by the community, and that sexual assault on underage children is rampant. What made me want to look into this was the fact that that one address that was posted in regards to Itchi Gross at 533 Bedford Ave in Brooklyn was located next to a shut down hebrew school (or something along those lines if my memory serves correct).
           </p>

            The above link describes 2 ex-members of the hasidic jewish community that were abused sexually - one in his school at the United Talmudical Academy by his principal, and the other while he was in a "mikvah", a bath house. I went ahead and I looked up the different locations of synagogues and Talmudical Academies in the area as well as other cases of sex crimes against underage children from the hasidic jewish community focusing on the williamsburg, Brooklyn area. That lead me to find this article titled "The Child-Rape Assembly Line" about a hasidic jewish whistleblower that revealed just how rampant these crimes are:
           </p>
           <p>
            <a href="http://www.vice.com/read/the-child-rape-assembly-line-0000141-v20n11">
             http://www.vice.com/read/the-child-rape-assembly-line-0000141-v20n11
            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            This whistleblower, Rabbi Nuchem Rosenberg, witnessed these abhorrent crimes for the first time in a mikvah, a bath house. Because he revealed the systematic nature of these crimes, he was excised from his community and was even the target of a bleach attack in which he had to go to the hospital with burns, partially blinded.
           </p>
           <p>
            Although I haven't yielded any damning information yet, I'm wondering with that one building at 533 bedford ave connected to Itchi Gross in regards to the Hasidic Jewish community - is there any overlap? If so, where and with whom?

             Good work. Itchie Gross does very much appear to be a part of or associated with the Hasidic community in the area. Just look at his Facebook friends. I think there was a page somewhere about a Drizin family wedding with several photos, one of which had Gross in it, but did not name him. According to his FB, he started working at the Aleph Institute earlier this year. They have a summer camp program for kids whose parents are incarcerated. The page for it has two butterfly logos on it. I think I remember seeing a Chaim Drizin on his list of FB friends.

            That blackpilled page says that Itchie's wife is Jane and is mentioned in the WikiLeaks stuff. Did he remarry? On Facebook, his wife pretty clearly seems to be Nechama.

            I don't have time to go through all of your links; but I'm guessing that you've archived their website and all the pedo symbology (assuming they havn't removed it)?
           </p>
           <p>
            Also, check out their FB page. It's got a bunch of their clients listed (including a local one that I'm digging into).

            Remember the Hillary pizza pac logo, from the Podesta email?
           </p>
           <p>
            After this came out, the website was bought by the same owners of goathill.com.

             I've been archiving, yes. I have many other screenshots and things that I haven't uploaded yet. I also found a local pizza place that is a customer of Pizza Packet. It's actually very close.
            </p>
            <p>
             So, that registrant in Panama with the Whoisguard protection is the most recent info on pizzapac.com?

            <p>
             What was the significance of goathill.com? I'm fuzzy on that.

              , from an email that I'm not finding, right now, (Has "logo" in the title.) was an inside joke.

             <p>
              I mentioned (on old Pizzagate) that someone should buy the domain. It turned out that someone had just done so the day before. The person who looked it up said domain was purchased by owner of goat hill domain.
             </p>
             <p>
              You really should check the history of Goat Hill Pizza. There should be some threads in the archived Pizzagate. It's another one in DC with creepy stuff on the website (including a pedo symbol in a child's drawing). I actually traced the drawing to the FB page of the child (now a teen) and resisted the urge to contact her (of course).
             </p>
             <p>
              But Goat Hill is owned by Nancy Pelosi. It needs much more attention, IMHO. Sorry for the disjointed comment. I'd do better if I were on my computer.
