             Amanda Knox is an example of a
             <strong>
              normal
             </strong>
             case where an American citizen got in trouble with the law overseas.
            </p>
            <p>
             Here's what you're leaving out of your post:
            </p>
            <p>
             <strong>
              Bill Clinton didn't personally go to Italy to intervene in the Amanda Knox case
             </strong>
             .
            </p>
            <p>
             and Bill basically got Silsby off. She was originally charged with kidnapping, which could have gotten her jailed for years. Clinton got the charges reduced to 'irregular travel' charges and negotiated a 6 month slap on the wrist for her.
            </p>
            <p>
             Also, it was him who got the Haitians to release the other nine without charging them.
            </p>
            <p>
             <strong>
              And the thousand dollar question is: why was Laura Silsby so much more important to the Clintons than Amanda Knox, or the dozens of other Americans who get arrested on serious charges overseas
             </strong>
             ?

              You mistakenly comparing a normal case of an America arrested for murder and the arrest of 10 Baptist Missionaries claiming they were trying to do good.
             </p>
             <p>
              Did Amanda Knox have three current or former Presidents of America's Largest Protestant Denomination calling on President Obama for help?
              <a href="http://bpnews.net/32224">
               These 10 Baptists did.
              </a>
             </p>
             <blockquote>
              <p>
               An appeal to President Obama has been made by three Southern Baptist Convention leaders in behalf of the 10 Baptist volunteers currently being held in Haiti on kidnapping and criminal association charges.
              </p>
              <p>
               The Feb. 5 letter asks the president "that you do everything within the authority of your office to secure a safe return home for these brothers and sisters in Christ as soon as possible."
              </p>
              <p>
               The Baptist leaders affirmed "the diplomatic negotiations currently under way between your Administration and the Haitian government to resolve this matter … to bring about a solution that respects the rule of law, honors international agreements, and ensures the best possible care and full legal representation for these Baptist mission volunteers."
              </p>
              <p>
               The letter was sent to President Obama by the president of the Southern Baptist Convention's Executive Committee, Morris H. Chapman; the SBC's president, Johnny Hunt; and the SBC's immediate past president, Frank Page, who is a member of the president's Council on Faith Based and Neighborhood Partnerships.
              </p>
              <p>
               "We have closely monitored news reports that these Baptist mission volunteers have been arrested, detained, and charged by the Haitian government on allegations of child kidnapping," the Baptist leaders wrote to the president. "It is our understanding that these mission volunteers were attempting to transport 33 Haitian children into the Dominican Republic for humanitarian purposes. We do not know all of the facts of this case, but we are concerned that the continued detainment and possible conviction of these Baptist mission volunteers will distract the world's attention and undermine the relief efforts so desperately needed by the Haitian people....
              </p>
              <p>
               "It is possible that the Baptist mission volunteers currently detained in Haiti have acted with the noblest of intentions in a desperate situation to meet an immediate need. We pray that is the case."
              </p>
             </blockquote>
             <p>
              Did the New York Times broadcast Amanda Knox's pleas for help from prison along with emotional photographs of her in a dark, dirty jail cell?  Because they did with these ten Baptists.
             </p>
             <blockquote>
              <p>
               The 10 Americans detained on kidnapping charges are pleading for the United States government to do more on their behalf and for the news media to focus on them less.
“Help us,” one of the detainees, Carla Thompson, said Monday as she lay on a bed in a scorching Port-au-Prince jail cell of about 8 feet by 5 feet, her ankles bandaged from infected mosquito bites. “That’s the message I would give to Mr. Obama and the State Department. Start helping us.”
              </p>
              <p>
               Sitting on a dirty concrete floor in the cell, another detainee, Corinna Lankford, nodded in agreement, a frustrated look on her face. “I have faith in God,” Ms. Lankford said. “But maybe the U.S. government could help a little more, too.”
              </p>

              It's absolute mistake to make this all about Silsby and the not full 10 people and an absolute mistake to think these 10 Baptists didn't have people outside the government trying to intercede on their behalf.  And if you think stories and photos like the NY Times Published don't have an affect on the Haitian government, not just the US government, I think you're mistaken.
             </p>
             <p>
              As late as February 16, far from given special treatment, their lawyer was complaining he could barely meet with them.
             </p>
             <blockquote>
              <p>
               And a lawyer for nine of the defendants, Aviol Fleurant, complained that Haitian police were restricting his visits to the Americans. "The lawyers are only being allowed in for three or five minutes," he said.
              </p>
             </blockquote>
             <p>
              The Whole PizzagateNarrative of the Silsby case is completely exterior to how the case unfolded.
