             A sharp remark about a local fire sparked a physical brawl between two East Hampton business leaders last month, resulting in a wrestling match on the floor of one of the town’s most exclusive golf clubs. The scuffle resulted in wounded feelings, a tsunami of local gossip, and the writing of a six-figure check.
            </p>
            <p>
             Ben Krupinski is perhaps East Hampton’s best-known builder, with a client list that includes Billy Joel and Martha Stewart (with whom his daughter claims he had an affair). The other combatant, Robert Rattenni, owns properties on the town’s Main Street and is a business partner of Mark Smith, the owner of Nick and Toni’s restaurant, where premium tables are, according to the Times, “the most coveted summer property in the Hamptons.”  ,,,
            </p>
            <p>
             To relieve the stress, he headed to the East Hampton Golf Club, a pricey retreat owned by Krupinski’s family. (Among many other notables, Lorne Michaels, Jeff Zucker, and Lloyd Blankstein have been known to play there.)

            Now for Zucker? THE Zucker? Are we talkin' President of CNN ZUCKER? The ZUCKER FUCKER that used to be President and CEO of NBC Universal? Hmmmmm .... let's start with his wife filing for divorce over Zucker's ''OBSESSION'' with Trump! You know, those that cry the loudest have something to hide, right fucker Zucker?

             CNN boss Jeff Zucker and his wife, Caryn, have filed for divorce due to Zucker’s “obsession with Trump” that Caryn claims has destroyed their 21 year marriage.
            </p>
            <p>
             According to friends, the couple “grew apart” after Zuck focussed all of his energy on trying to “take down Donald Trump” and neglecting his wife and their kids in the pursuit of that goal.

            <p>
             We received an email tonight from an unconfirmed CNN insider.  Since we JUST received this information, we have not had time to fully vet everything, but we are currently working on confirming the source.
            </p>
            <p>
             What this insider has told us is:
            </p>
            <ul>
             <li>
              John McCain, Lindsey Graham, Tom Cotton and other republicans are in regular contact with Wolf Blitzer and Tapper, leaking negative info on Trump.
             </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
             The talking points against Trump are handed down by Jeff Zucker, and his lapdog is Brian Stelter. Everyone here is mad as hell at being accused of pushing fake news. But that is what they do.
            </p>
            <p>
             The insider claims on Sunday (2/19/17), the order came down to smear Trump with anti-semitic accusations.  The insider says “They decide what subject to smear Trump with and it’s always Zucker telling Stelter – and Stelter works with Wolf, Cuomo, and Tapper, and sometimes Gloria is consulted.”
            </p>
            <p>
             Our unconfirmed insider claims what they  (CNN) always discuss off camera is PizzaGate. CNN treats it like fake news, but they are all scared of it.   Our insider claims Anderson Cooper was seeing an 18 year old man in NYC not too long ago and was terrified this would get out.
            </p>
           </blockquote>
           <p>
            So Brian Stelter. is your lapdop, Zucker Fucker? What else does he do when he's in your lap? Anything you'd like in print? Or is it something else that's troubling you ... like the money you were going to get from SKANKLES giving you a lucrative piece of the pizza pie once she
            <s>
             took her throne
            </s>
            got in office?
           </p>
           <p>
            Yeah, not sure why it took this long for Zucker Fucker to get on our radar, but I'm sure there's lots more going on with this Krupinski guy.

            Not sure if any of this is related to the crash.

            The father of reported crash victim William Maerove is one of the four board members who fired Harvey Weinstein from The Weinstein Company, Lance Maerov.
           </p>
           <p>
            His son William was the Krupinskis' grandson:

            <p>
             Bernard Krupinski — who built sprawling homes for celebrities like Martha Stewart and Billy Joel — was in the plane with his wife, Bonnie Krupinski....their grandson, William Maerov, 22, and pilot Jon Dollard, 47....
            </p>
            <p>
             Maerov, a Georgetown grad, is son of the Krupinskis’ daughter, Laura and her ex-husband Lance Maerov....[who] was scrutinized for how he handled contract negotiations as a board member of portly pervert Harvey Weinstein’s scandal-ridden former company.

             Weinstein was reportedly notified of his termination in an email in early October. The New York Times reported that the company's four board members—Lance Maerov, Bob Weinstein (Harvey's brother), Richard Koenigsberg, and Tarak Ben Ammar—made the decision to fire him

            Wait.  Just because this is in the Hamptons, everyone needs to go full retard?  Regular working class people are the vast majority of residents in the Hamptons folks.  Stop buying into this "all wealthy people are automatically Satanpedo" bullshit.   Some people died in a plane crash, it happens, and it's actually very sad, not a conspiracy theory.

            wow !!  Red flags EVERYWHERE on this story from the reporter, the witness and the Police.
           </p>
           <p>
            Reporter: ' They are trying to locate the other two bodies that were on the BOAT.. '  uh... It was an airplane, dude.
           </p>
           <p>
            Witness -- Looks blatantly rehearsed, especially when describing the squall line that moved in. Appears to be attempting to gin up tears  and inject a sense of drama and 'prays there were no children on board'.
           </p>
           <p>
            Cop -- Stammering through the description of events with a series of 'UH's', and looks nervous and very unprofessional.
           </p>
           <p>
            Other RED FLAGS &gt;&gt;  They get a statement from Schneiderman who just resigned in disgrace and is being accused of violently beating women during sex?  'I'm devastated' Schneiderman, says.. Yeah, I bet you are, you sick fucker.
           </p>
           <p>
            From the text &gt;&gt; ' The Coast Guard found two bodies and are
            <strong>
             desperately
            </strong>
            looking for two more...'  Hyperbole much?
           </p>
           <p>
            Also, the article looks almost pre-written, including extensive quotes and research of the houses that were built by the victim.

             The article also noted that the family was estranged from the daughter because she made statements saying that her father and Martha Stewart were having an affair. He completely cut her off from receiving any money and contact as well. Hmm. Makes one wonder. If not for that.............plus what you have reported.  This def needs digging.  I and I assume others have long suspected the Hamptons.  Another Playground for the Rich.

               Wow.  That would be something if someone could remember or find it.  I vaguely remember something like that too.  Especially since it was not that long after.  I have always wondered what the pillows were for.  I

                being too busy with Grandkids to dig further . I use to think that most mods here were planted to divert the truth , but my problem was with MF ultimately. I had to learn the rules too and still have issues remembering them , especially when I'm busy or in a hurry because it always gets flaired , but that's my fault . This story has tons of legs and someone should repost it that has more time .

               : The rules were made by the community. You had the opportunity to chime in when the rules discussion sticky was up, in case you would have liked to propose changes.
              </p>
              <p>
               And I can tell you - I'm glad when I don't have to flair posts, and don't have to pull them. Means less work. :-)
              </p>
              <p>
               So I don't understand your comment, I'm afraid. I was the user who proposed to introduce a period of grace before post would be pulled, in order to give OPs the opportunity to amend / edit posts.
              </p>
              <p>
               While I initially thought of a period of grace of half an hour ;-),

                @Vindicator
               </a>
               suggested to leave up the posts for 24 hours, which we do now. So it's really sad that you insinuate we would be 'dedicated' to removing posts imo.
              </p>
              <p>
               If you're not sure whether a post might adhere to the rules, you can always ask us mods before, or submit to
               <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/v/pizzagatewhatever">
                v/pizzagatewhatever
               </a>
               first, ping the mods, and then crosspost to
               <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/v/pizzagate">
                v/pizzagate

            He was a contractor to the Stars !
"Southampton Supervisor Jay Schneiderman said he had known Krupinski and his family for more than 20 years, and Krupinski owned an office where Schneiderman once worked out of on the East End "

             contractor to the stars. Now that should tell us all something right there. Secret rooms, basements, tunnels. that are not on floor plans or have permits pulled etc. I know that there are contractors where i am from that talk about building secret spaces for rich people. they are asked to sign non disclosure agreements, etc. they are paid good to do it. I used to not question why that would happen, but knowing what i know now....

             It's not yet known which of the passengers' bodies have been found, besides that of Mr Krupinski. Schneiderman could not confirm whether Ms Krupinski had survived the crash.

            <p>
             The article also noted that the family was estranged from the daughter because she made statements saying that her father and Martha Stewart were having an affair.  He completely cut her off from receiving any money and contact as well.  Hmm. Makes one wonder.  If not for that.............

               Most definitely.  We will have to watch and see if he survives.  Also, we should dig much deeper into the Hamptons.  There is probably a treasure trove of weird stuff going on there.  Think of people like Matt Lauer.

                And any of the other talking heads .. I just think about what 911 did to millions of people . PG far surpasses the 911 job ! I had a delivery the other day from something I bought from a random person online and this person stayed for 2 hours talking about PG ! He was in his 30s and knew all about it ! I invited him to join us here on voat because he said he hasn't been able to focus on much else since 2016 😲 ..ha ! Oh how we know that feeling 🙂

                 We can always use those that are already in the know and can teach others.  What great news. So many now believe 911 was not what it seemed at the time.  So why don't they believe PG?  As you say, it far surpasses 911.  It is even harder to believe.

                  The 9/11 truther movement is sponsored by people who have a vested interest in you not knowing the truth about what happened on 9/11.  Probably a lot of Saudi money goes to that one.  Pizzagate, on the other hand, is a counter operation.  There is no viable "alternate theory" so the shills spend all their time squashing information and discussion, and targeting those who pursue the facts.

                   Well, yes and that is the reason we are swamped with shills on here, especially when we have found a really important part of our cause with evidence.  Something they keep trying to fight, but so far we are still here.
