            I don't think there would be much point going against small fry at this point, with pedo arrests going on all over the country, and Trump giving more and more signals that he is going to move.   Although you might dispense some shills to tell tales and scary stories to put a general damper on internet sleuths with very little effort.  Who knows, though?   It is hard to think like these people.   Somethingn like JA going off the rails at pizzagategear guy was counter-productive to his efforts to pretend he is the innocent pizza shop owner.

            May I make a recommendation?  Don't stop what you think they are harassing you for.  That's what they want.  There are only so many of them and keeping them busy will keep the harassment as light as possible for other members in your area.  Spread them out as thin as possible.  Think of a hamster in a wheel.  Keep them running so more information can get out.  Also, ask other people to contribute and open websites.  As they are worn out, they'll do something stupid that will get them caught.  Study your city or town's stalking laws and keep a well charged camera or cellphone handy at all time to aid authorities.  Their numbers will be decreasing and hiding as the busts continue.  Wear them down and don't give in!  Pedos are a well-organized crime ring, and keeping them busy saves children's lives and lessens abuse.  Stop these people by any means necessary.  Hamster them.

            Inb4 I need moar money guise. There are cops outside and they are going to send their drones and poison me with red food coloring until another fund goes up. Trust me guise, I'm going to run for congress with this big gold money and take a vacation right now because my toilet paper isn't soft enough here in Cali, thinking Canada has better toilet paper.
           </p>
           <p>
            Then I'll go to canada because there are cops outside again and they are always watching me protest gravity without sources. Also fuck Podesta, tomorrow my sources will take him down, you'll see elite arrests are coming next week, I mean next month, welp looks like I need more money to say fuck Hillary Clinton, buy more gold coins guise, I need a trip to Florida, I haven't slept very good because its cold here in canada, I'm thinking the weather is nicer in Florida, check out my view guise. Wait, FUCK JOHN PODESTA, FUCK HILLARY CLINTON, FUCK THE ELITES.TOMORROW THEY ARE GOING DOWN FOR SURE!!! It's very easy to use these gold coins guys, they even have cubes.
           </p>
           <p>
            I don't make any commision money. My hamster wheel is broken, could somebody fund it? Here is my Patreon. Thank you fans, I mean friends.

            Anyone that is tired of Mr. Semen's trickery. Follow these channels instead; George Webb:
            <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCrQ-wHKVi0JDWjQGcuoYnew">
             https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCrQ-wHKVi0JDWjQGcuoYnew
            </a>
            (this guy sources everything and asks for nothing, goes incredibly deep into the investigation, I suggest start from day 80 and work your way up to the current date)
           </p>
           <p>
            Also follow; Honeybee:
            <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCBvKlVzDz3611dvHHo_wGlA">
             https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCBvKlVzDz3611dvHHo_wGlA
            </a>
            (she also does a kick ass job of making huge connections that cannot and should not be ignored, she also doesn't ask for money) These 2 channels actually care about helping children without seeking to gain from it like the fucking media whore that David's Semen is. If anyone has more credible channels please comment and link them.

            If you believe you have been targeted by serious players. Understand that those who are engaged to apply pressure on you will be professionals. For the most part they do not work alone, surveillance and intimidation is always more effective done in teams of  3 or more. This means different cars and faces. Photos are your friend, they can confirm suspicions. Routines are your enemies, always use random directions and times for any trips to the store or what not. If you suspect you are being tailed and want to make it hard on them then turn your trip into an inner city road trip with no destination. After 10 to 15 miles of random street, driving in circles I have found the tails will give up or try to escalate to intimidation tactics. Intimidation is always a bad tactic against those who are ready to defend themselves. A small fender bender can reveal intel  if they stop, such as  name, home address and employer. Once that information is in your hands the pressure is on them after that. No one in their business likes a law suite, it is bad for business. If they don't stop their license number will put the cops on them for hit and run also bad for business. Either way takes them off the game board. If they are the different type of Pro then be prepared. This is a real fight not some school yard bully beat down. Watch your back and keep your nose clean, don't give them the ammo to destroy you. That means no hookers,  no drugs. :)

             Good. You know the drill. Also, any lock can be opened. Even a safety box in a bank can be accessed. These are pros with connections. Sounds crazy but it happened to me and no, no one else had a key other than the bank! I had a witness thankfully or this crazy shit is just too hard to explain or have verified. If you have someone you trust keep them close to you when you sense something could go down. 
Also, try to stay calm and don't assume everything means something. If you fall into paranoia you think everyone is in on it. They aren't

             I think you have a basic misunderstanding of what "proof" is.
            </p>
            <p>
             Connecting dots is not proof. Insinuation is not proof. Speculation is not proof.
            </p>
            <p>
             Either 1) The FBI is looking into this and YOU DON'T NEED TO KNOW ABOUT IT BECAUSE YOU'D BLOW THE FUCKING COVER.
            </p>
            <p>
             or
            </p>
            <p>
             2) The FBI doesn't care because there's nothing to see here.
            </p>
            <p>
             I'll even give you the benefit of the doubt for option three:
            </p>
            <p>
             3) The FBI doesn't care because they're part of the conspiracy.
            </p>
            <p>
             I'm guessing you're into number three. Do you have any actual reason for that?

                "burden of proof".........Really? So the fact that hospital in Oklahoma City is "not in good standing" has no relevance here?
               </p>
               <p>
                Sorry, you're going to have to explain how a non-University Hospital "not in good standing" for no organ audit trail isn't possibly related to Organ Harvesting.
               </p>
               <p>
                In the event you're not a shill and were hit in the head playing Little League: Organ Harvesting is only possible if there's no audit trail. If an Organ has no AUDIT TRAIL it could have come from anybody.
               </p>
               <p>
                It would be like you buying a used car and seeing the VIN number scratched out. That would be relevant wouldn't it? Same deal with Organs. If a Hospital is dealing in Organs it can't source that's not good.

            just in case you are a shill could you explain why you're shilling for organ harvesters and child rapists?

            If you find that you're a victim of gang stalking, the key is to not lash out at them. This is what they want. Trust me, I know. I was a victim of this. Just stay cool and ask the owner/bouncer/manager of whatever business you're at to take note of them and they'll be removed as soon as they make themselves obvious. If you're alone, go into a business and stay there and stay cool.

                Prove it, check my recent submissions.  For me this is spiritual warfare with the ruling elite who prey on our children and sacrificing them to devils, you best believe I'm taking this stuff seriously.  I'm sick and tired of injustice in this world and they think they can get away with it.

            I've started having some specific out-of-state (way out-of-state, not tri-state area) cars park around where I live, in line of site of my place, reversed into the parking spot, sit there for N period of time and then drive away. They don't get out, nobody goes to them, nothing.
           </p>
           <p>
            If it continues for more than a week in the same pattern, I'm going to take a camera and go up and question them.

             Go with a large friend who can also move quickly when required.   He can do the filming, you do the questions.

              Same car showed up again for 3rd time today. I tipped the police to them 30 minutes ago, they show up, next thing I know there are 4 cop cars here, turns out they are in a cross-state child type dispute with someone in the apartment complex and they were not supposed to be there. Now 4 cops are here trying to sort out the domestic dispute between this girl that lives here and out-of-state husband/boyfriend guy.

             <p>
              So, in this case, it was a coincidence...

               Good and as you can see not everything is as dire as 'they' are watching you. Keep a cool head is really important. I know it does happen but not everything is related and it's best to not jump to conclusions
