            No. It's about control and power and repetition compulsion.
How many priests have been involved in child sexual abuse so it's not all about elite conspiracy.

            Personally I think people like Jeffrey Epstein are often involved in black mail.

           <p>
            impossible? I don't understand how many teachers, coaches, etc have been in the news? IMO and research shows most predators were abused themselves but most victims don't become predators.

            I think pedophilia is a  combination of sexual drive, extreme narcissism, but  mostly CONTROL/POWER, many times with  brutality-all falling under the  category of sociopathology/psychopathology-
for  all  practical  purposes these  humans are  no  longer Homo-Sapien, but an offshoot that  has  to  be exterminated with  extreme  prejudice, the  Bad Seed

            Imagine also that you have a less than average male endowment, much less, and that a sexually experienced woman may not be particularly attracted or willing. A child, on the other hand, with no previous experience, has no basis for making any kind of comparison. What is, simply is.

            I think it is like all things -- the elite think that they are better than everyone else.  The "normal" rules don't apply to them.
           </p>
           <p>
            As for their deviancy leading to higher positions, yes and no.  No, it isn't merely sexual deviancy that leads them to their positions of power.  The fact is that most of the elite are psychopaths.  They have no qualms about rape, murder, cannibalism, etc. because they have no conscience.  The are incapable of feeling empathy or having concern for anyone but themselves.  Sexual deviancy (especially the rape of children) is the means to control those who may not be true psychopaths like themselves but who are willing to do immoral things because their love of money is the primary driving force in their lives.  They blackmail those people with tapes of pedophilia because pedophilia is the one sexual deviancy that is still taboo at this moment.  It is the only scandal that can still bring politicians down.  Well, that and criticizing Jews or Israel.  In fact, as far as the media is concerned, criticizing Jews or Israel is an even greater sin than pedophilia.
