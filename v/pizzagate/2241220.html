            My gay cousin was scouted by some saudi royal a few years back when he was around 16. I am guessing whilst out on the UK Gay scene. Anyway he was paid to go to Ibiza and live in a mansion with a bunch of other boys. He maintains that nothing happened with him, but the stipulation of the trip and payment is that they were available to his wishes whenever they were requested. My cousin said they would get a phonecall to say the Arab would be arriving for dinner and he would come and eat with them and leave, All young boys/men. Other times he would select them for 1-1 meetings but my cousin never stipulated what they were as he never had one himself before leaving early.
