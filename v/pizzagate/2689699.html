            "The report alludes to allegations from a Tacoma police officer that bribery may have played a role in the release of a prominent architect arrested last year after he allegedly defied a construction flagger and almost hit him with his car. Sgt. Robert Blystone ordered arresting Officer Joe Bundy to release architect Leroy Pardini after Pardini was heard to brag about his connections to city hall and asked, "What will it take to make this go away?" "

           <p>
            My name is Alexis Crawford. I am a whistle-blower trying to expose the Freemason Sex Trafficking Cult that operates in TACOMA, Washington. My family is full of Freemasons. My father Anthony Crawford is a Freemason leader. He and other members of my family work for the government. My family are involved in a cult that stalks, spies on, drugs, kidnaps, rapes, sex traffics and murders people including children. My family are responsible for men, women and children becoming missing persons. They are also responsible for the disappearance and sex trafficking of my girlfriend Amanda Christine O’Brien-Martinez.
           </p>
           <p>
            I was in a relationship with Amanda for 4 years when she suddenly went missing in late June 2016. Amanda’s disappearance occurred immediately after we were both DRUGGED and RAPED by my cousin MIGUEL SWAIN and my father ANTHONY CRAWFORD.
           </p>
           <p>
            I was sentenced to 14 months in the Washington Corrections Center for Women.
           </p>
           <p>
            Two Tacoma detectives visited me in jail and recorded an interview with me. During this, I informed police that my father was responsible for Amanda’s disappearance. I told them about the fake Facebook page, and the blood in my father’s house and truck. The police did not investigate my witness statement.
           </p>
           <p>
            During my incarceration, friends of my cousin Miguel, Faye Reynolds and Kaila Nicole Borgman-Seaward, both told me that my father ANTHONY CRAWFORD, my step brother JAMES LEON ARCHIE, my cousin MIGUEL SWAIN and Miguel’s friends GABE MORALES, DOLORES MORALES and MOONEY were in a human sex trafficking ring. They said this group of people kidnapped Amanda, took her to Miguel’s trailer where they repeatedly subjected her to drugging, torture, rape, and gang rape. They said the group video tapped themselves raping Amanda, and sex trafficking her.
           </p>
           <p>
            FAYE REYNOLDS and KAILA NICOLE BORGMAN-SEAWARD both told me in front of numerous witnesses, that they would assist with a police investigation into Amanda’s abduction. They both said they visited Miguel’s trailer numerous times and personally witnessed and spoke with Amanda at the trailer.
           </p>
           <p>
            In September 2017, I requested the prison contact the Police. Consequently, Deputy DAN WULICK from the PIERCE COUNTRY Sheriff’s Department visited the prison and took three witness statements from me regarding three separate crimes. The first report concerned Miguel drugging and raping Amanda and I in June 2016. The second report related to my father drugging and raping Amanda and I in June 2016. The third report concerned my father and cousin kidnapping, raping and sex trafficking Amanda.

            I have copied parts that had names in them but there is much more to this story here.  We should listen to this woman.  You may not agree with her lifestyle, but she is a human being and wants to do the right thing by outing these horrid people.  We know that many LE are Freemason.  She is putting her life on the line naming her family and their conspirators.

            Tacoma, Washington is the city by Puget Sound where Beebo flew his alleged suicide mission into an island, and not far from where that missile was launched out of Skunk Bay and then covered up.
           </p>
           <p>
            The island where the plane crashed has bunkers and CIA spooks all over it, apparently is a hangout for billionaires, and maybe a west coast equivalent of Epstein's Island.
           </p>
           <p>
            So in light of all of that, I find this accusation credible. If she's not personally legit then there is nonetheless still something very obviously fishy about this area.

             There's for sure something fishy about this area. I personally know a lady from port orchard who is an SRA survivor. She has multiple personalities and a drug problem but heard from associates that her son is involved in trafficking. I don't know if this is true or not but I know that this a port area that would be real easy to traffick someone from..

             don't forget the mayor of seattle being a pedo.
            </p>
            <p>
             i've made personal calls myself to tacoma police regarding there being a random rundown pickup truck parked in my old apartments parking lot for weeks.\ i would stay up at night watching from my window and see people living in this truck, saw them with needles, lighting bowls from the bottom like it was crack not weed, pissing on the wall of the building, throwing trash and cigs everywhere.. but to top it off there was a kid living in the truck too, couldnt have been older then 5-6 yrs old. i would continuously make phonecalls to 911 about this and they wouldnt even come look, they would say "we'll take note of it and have someone look when theyre in the area"... which would NEVER happen, not once. the last call i made before giving up the 911 responder said "you need to call apartment management, since its private property we cant do anything". that blew my mind, made absolutely no sense to me at the time.
apartment management was barely existent and crooked so they wouldn't do anything either. so the truck stayed and eventually left on their own after another 2 weeks or so.
            </p>
            <p>
             tacoma has some nice areas here and there, but its well known to be the more ghetto end of the seattle area. it can get very sketchy depending on which street youre on.

              I agree, I always get bad vibes from Tacoma. I will say there are some great police officers that work there and some not so good. I prefer to stay on the other side of the bridge ^_^

            Hi Factfinder2, I am going to flair this 'Unverified', since we don't have other sources for her claims (apart from reports about her trial and prison sentence). Thanks for understanding.
           </p>
           <p>
            Please keep up the excellent work!

             We post claims here. It does not have to prove anything. Why do you continually label things unverified and then promote Q hearsay? You are gatekeeping. Why not leave, we don't need you controlling the spin in here.

             I'm a v/ pizzagate researcher and offered the Truepeoplesearch.com info as a starting point for anyone who wants to help look into this person's claims.
            </p>
            <p>
             So far, her claim that a local newspaper printed the story of her arrest has checked out.

              I used to follow waynemadsenreport..He had a friend in  Spokane Washington...had gone out there to visit her. She reported extremely bizarre things happening on that visit, including a honey pot.At the time, I dismissed it as too bizarre to get into..although I trust their writing as much as any journalists. CounterPunch stated he was the last real journalist in the US.
