<p>I know they made the camera look the other way the day before their previous false flag; surely they know better than to try it for 2nd time..  
</p>
<p>Either way just wanted to make sure there was an awareness of the change and maybe we can find a way to petition the court or police department in order to find out who authorized it being repositioned and why.</p>
<p><strong>EDIT</strong> The 1st pic which shows a time of 1 AM should actually be 2017-01-25 7:32:35 AM EST (4 seconds before the change)  
</p>
<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> I downloaded all the DC area street cams as provided on <a href="http://www.trafficland.com/city/WAS5">http://www.trafficland.com/city/WAS5</a> and out of 177 feeds, 13 were down or unavailable; but guess which was the only one to not be looking at the street? yep the CPP was the only GOV owned street camera to not be looking at a street.

I haven\'t had a chance to go through all the downloaded frames but i just seen this one wtf..<br />
Here is a gif of the cars leaving, I\'ll upload the entire event soon. <a href="http://imgur.com/a/FnwDs">http://imgur.com/a/FnwDs</a>  
</p>
<p><strong>EDIT</strong> For anyone who wants to download the full captures. I only have partial data for the 22nd due to script errors.. and unfortunately I had broken things on the 26th and didn\'t realize it until just earlier and so because of that I only have images saved from 1.26.17-1.01.04-AM.EST to 1.26.17-6.59.57-AM.EST :(  
</p>
<p>I would have loved to have the frames showing them switching it back to default, but thank you <a href="https://voat.co/user/LadyGoldenVein">@LadyGoldenVein</a> for logging the time it was switched back at 8:54 AM (EST?)  
</p>
<p>Also or the 26th and after, the folder structure changes to show 3 different cams:  
</p>
<p>200118 - Connecticut Ave NW &amp; Oliver St NW ~6 miles north of cpp<br />
200119 - CPP<br />
200122 - Connecticut Ave &amp; Van Ness ~4 miles south of cpp

            For anyone who wants to download the full captures. I only have partial data for the 22nd due to script errors.. and unfortunately I had broken things on the 26th and didn't realize it until just earlier and so because of that I only have images saved from 1.26.17-1.01.04-AM.EST to 1.26.17-6.59.57-AM.EST :(
           </p>
           <p>
            I would have loved to have the frames showing them switching it back to default, but thank you

            for logging the time it was switched back at 8:54 AM (EST?)
           </p>
           <p>
            Also or the 26th and after, the folder structure changes to show 3 different cams:

            Well I don't agree with doing anything illegal or harrassing.  So that would have to be figured out prior to taking any physical action whatsoever.  You sound like someone who wants to discredit this investigation.  Bye bye.

            Whoever is going to start filming should also film the other nearby storefronts. CPP is one but don't forget Besta Pizza and Buck's and the other stores nearby as well.

            It should ring some pretty hardcore alarmbells in everyones head with those two SUVs. Not sure what to make of it, but I think suggestions of getting cameras in there is important and must be done immediately. It might be someone on the inside sending us a message to do excactly that.

            They want us to think they are investigating but they are not.
           </p>
           <p>
            Just like the white house petition which is on like 80 votes.
           </p>
           <p>
            It's more fraud then before. Before they would say: fuck you. Now they are faking shit like this camera with cars and the vote which has a formula like:
           </p>
           <p>
            realVoteCount / 1000 = (int) fakeVoteCount

            You can use various opensource software tools to monitor the traffic cam stream. I would use zoneminder.com but there are many others like motion.

            I'll be in D.C. this weekend. There was way too much going on with inauguration to even be around the city. That being said. I'll be in NW from 6am to about 3pm. And plan on taking recon photos I promised earlier. If you have anything in particular...you should PM me the details of what you need. I AM DELETING THIS ACCOUNT THIS WEEKEND- D.c.An0n

            I didnt look into that and while it's certainly possible, its just not something i'd be willing to spend much time one.. but here is the feed about 4 miles north of CPP:

            To make it easy, here is the link to the actual live-feed camera across the street from Comet Ping Pong (now pointing at the gas station):
            <a href="http://ie.trafficland.com/200119/full?system=trafficland-www&amp;pubtoken=4f066cd1df66e281b8d314b19d2af4fa0e222c58fe720dab893827a6adf87f33&amp;refreshRate=2000">

            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            The camera provides video, but when I look, it looks to only take a snapshot and freeze and does not refresh. Is there a way to get a live feed without manually refreshing the screen??

            That's interesting! I came across this website that had a lot of information about what's underground in Washington  DC. Don't know if anyone has checked it out before...http://untappedcities.com/2014/07/25/the-underground-city-beneath-the-u-s-capitol-and-library-of-congress/

             Wait, then... so what I am seeing is a 360 degree rotateable camera, which would be controlled electronically not by philysically turning it... how are you able to tell which way it's facing all I see is the glass bubble encasing it, I cant see which way it's facing..
            </p>
            <p>
             But that being said if I'm looking at the right camera, then there may be a way to send commands to it and rotate it, use their own tricks against them..

             I believe there is a red light camera which doesnt store recordings, and the one I posted is the only one I'm aware of. But I can assure you that this is legit which is why I posted before and after for both night time and day, just to help prove that it isn't photoshopped or anything like that.

              I have to point out that I fought off a red light camera ticket one time and I told the Administrative Judge that there's no possible way they aren't saving the recordings. They're constantly monitoring people. They record constantly, until they see something and then they save what they see. So they save what they want. Which I would venture to guess is everything. I could be wrong, but that judge dismissed my ticket on constitutional grounds and our city voted them out of town.

                That the red light cameras are a violation of the Fourth Amendment since the government has no right to spy on citizens on the street 24-7 and constantly record and then go back and decide if they want to keep the footage to "only" be looking for violations. That the police have to observe this in person because otherwise it's just 24-7 surveillance of everyone. That if they happen to see a guy shoot someone on the camera, you can bet they will save that footage but that doesn't make it legal. I'm sure this argument is probably negated by the Patriot Act but the Patriot Act would still be unconstitutional. I also said if they can spy on me on the street with cameras, what is to stop them from spying on me while I'm in my bedroom and then saving the footage IF I committed a crime. It was like 4 years ago so I'm not exactly sure what else I said. But just basic fourth amendment stuff.

                 IDK if I'm right, but I guess the administrative hearing judge agreed with me or just felt like dismissing it for some other unknown reason. Obviously I want them watching CPP but I feel that they have probable cause to do so. There is no reasonable suspicion that I'm going to be committing a crime by driving down the street, otherwise the cops would just run their dashcams 24-7 and sit outside of bars waiting for drunk people to leave but at least where I live, that's illegal. They have to wait until they see a violation before they start surveilling you with the dashcam I think.

              Did you look at the link I posted? If you zoom in, you can see two identical cameras. If you rotate the street view, you can see that those two cameras would offer the two views you have posted as before and after.

               There may be 2 cameras there, but even so there's only 1 publicly accessible one, so it might be possible that they switched of f one while switching on the other on, but my doubt there is that the site I used (which ill add to the top) assigns each camera a web_id and that hasn't changed for me.

            I wonder how they move it if it's a physical act or a electronic controller. If it's a physical act then can we just have someone move it back? Or if it's electronic maybe we can figure out how to move it online.

             If it needs to be moved physically, i've spotted a van pulling into the gas station 87 seconds after the angle changes. that would be enough time get back to his vehicle and pull around to the station.

              Cars are constantly pulling into gas stations throughout the day and night. The cops may have been trying to catch someone in that van. Or they are following whoever is in the black SUVs. Or it's just a coincidence. Or they wanted to get away from the street view of whoever is going in and out of CPP.

                Wait now I'm confused because the mod posted the street view and the camera I see is one of those electronically rotateable ones, not one that you physically rotate. Am I just looking at the wrong thing or something... do you guys not see that it's the typical security camera bubble that you see on the ceilings of stores etc?

            How does a traffic camera pointed at an Exxon station and the sidewalk benefit info about traffic?
Wondering if the original position which included CPP was near a stop light?
Why would it have been pointed directly at that business?
            <br/>
            Was there some interest in what was going on there?
I believe there was concern about it per Frank Winstead.

             Yeah, good point.. maybe they are doing exchanges of dirty things in those black SUVs at the gas station. Or waiting for a particular spy to show up.

             only found this

             Crisis Management Firm

             president of the company is Judy Smith

            - very interesting and seems like Alefutile would fit as one of her clients (having helped Michael Vick, Monica Lewinsky, and helped spin the L.A. riots -- she's a real winner, this one) Edit:

              Upvoat. To call it before it happens and watch it go down -- would be priceless and the satisfaction would be intoxicating. I've pondered before, to befriend a crisis actor and have intel on the hoax as it happens... Does anybody viewing these comments know any Crisis Actors? Treat 'em well. 'Keep your enemies closer than your friends.' That and Praise be to Kek!

             Judy Smith is the inspiration for the character Olivia Pope in the show
             <em>
              Scandal
             </em>
             where the fixer always operates just inside the grey area of the law to make things right for her high-paying, powerful clients...

            <blockquote>
             <p>

             Hmm...I wonder if this Judy Smith is any relation to John Smith, owner of pizzagate.com, who is lifting material wholesale from investigators here to populate his webpage, and trying to auction the domain for $12,500?

              no - she would be a client.  In interviews she talks about how she was bullied. She needed PR help.  Now she gives appearances talking about online bullying - no doubt uses a PR person for that.

                and they do a lot more than that.  They would be the "spin masters" for example that could do everything from say, putting Alefantis on with Megan Kelly - booking that interview - to planting the meme of fake/news pizzagate with specific reporters and bloggers, all the way to possibly hiring crises actors for "events".   Just depends on who their clients would be - CIA could be a client, (a specific operator in the CIA.)

                PR is perception management, and all that that might entail.  Fine line between that and propaganda.

                 The term 'Perception Management' should stop anyone in their tracks. Tavistock, SRI, Esalen... I can't stand the fact that there are other people out there that have nothing better to do than attempt to control someone's perceptions... getting paid for it to boot.

                AreYouSure is not a mod, and generally pokes out from his hideyhole only when a Truth is posted. So, arewesure has actually become a good barometer for this investigation. DIG IN.

              Not a clue. Haven't looked into it. It's doubtful, from what I remember but I wouldn't put it past them. I just noticed her name on "The Fixer's' bio page as being a client. Judy is as dirty as they come for spin -- having worked under the Bush administration (9/11) as
              <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judy_Smith">
               Deputy Press Secretary
              </a>
              (says it all). She also advised Sony Pictures Entertainment after their 2014 cyber attack -- and if I remember correctly there was a movie (coincidentally timed and the plot centered around North Korea, big budget Hollywood film, comedy), the hack was spun as coming from North Korea, and hackers later exposed it as coming from Maryland, I believe ( a little too close to the Alphabet Gangs). She's dirty.

            Excellent observation. My first thought was they will change it a few times. Then, when questioned as to why it was changed before the 'shooter' they can say it changes on a regular basis.

             I wonder if the camera has been switched many times before its just that no one notices till now...like every time they did shady shit in the past they probably turned the cameras away from the road.

            Either they're plotting another false flag (God I hope not) or they decided to leave it that way now as CYA when future questions arise about it being moved ("We just moved it to better assess an area. Just normal procedure, move along"). If asked why it moved back, they were "testing" the move's effects first.

            Someone should go and set up another camera to cover that area and then link to the live feed so people can check on it from all over the world 24/7. I know in London there are random people's web cams set up all over the place and there's a website on which you can search for a particular street and see if someone has a camera nearby and watch it live online.

             This! Cameras are so cheap these days, someone near the area really should do this. I'm really worried they might be planning something BIG, something that will completely discredit PG.
            </p>
            <p>
             Please, if you or someone you know lives near here, then go buy a cheap camera and record CPP. It doesn't have to be live streamed, as long as you provide the raw footage later, that works too. But someone needs to do this, if CPP does something really terrible then having footage could save this movement from being discredited.

               Why not? CPP has become a huge liability. It would be in their best interest to get rid of the place. And the way that they operate is to blow shit up and throw out some IDs of supposed "terrorists". They'll conjure up some deranged "Pizzagate Fanatic" and take the place out; so that Alefantis can get out from under the spotlight and cash in on a nice insurance claim.

              So assuming "someone" does this... what are the costs?
             </p>
             <p>
              So: Which GPRS/Cell data streaming cam is best and how can it be discreetly mounted such that the opposers to this idea would not be able to remove it? How legal is it? You'd need multiple cams - but the image it takes will give its location away.
             </p>
             <p>
              instead, a new system should be developed... a drone which will hover and take images... not video (unless told to but images)...

            This is the same location where the "stink bomb" was being planned by J20, on top of everything else...perhaps a concerned local citizen should setup a live feed to replace the missing shot, ala Frank Winstead.  He was warning people pretty vocally.

            Danger Danger....Trump needs to get the damn FBI or Federal Marshals or some such group to watch that place very very closely the next several days.   I hope he doesnt let them say some right winger went in there and killed folks.   We would never hear the end of it...but they got to know lots of folks wont believe their bullshit any longer.
