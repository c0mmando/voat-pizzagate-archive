            Has anyone done any research on Ted Christopher. Just doing the basic searches I can find nothing about his personal life. The articles don't mention where he is from in CT. Wiki page only lists racing accomplishments. The only obituary I found was, again, a recap of his racing. 
Even the articles about the plane crash are vague in that it doesn't state the 81yo was actually piloting the plane. What gives here?

              Good deal. I did little more digging this morning. A FB with a blank profile pic appears to be his.not much there. I did find an article about his relationship mentoring Keith Rocco, another known Mod driver from the that area. In that article, Rocco mentioned Christopher's shop in Plainville, CT.  That video I edited my other comment to include, that happened on 9/11/17 in none other than PLAINVILLE, CT.
             </p>
             <p>
              Another crash back in July in Plainville killed the pilot, James Seaver, who had a warrant sworn for his arrest the day before the crash, for raping a girl 2 yrs prior who was 12 at the time.
             </p>
             <p>
              I can't post links right now but I hope to this evening.
             </p>
             <p>
              Also, the name Rocco jumps out because a Rocco was one of the other auction bidders with Bemer for the Speed bowl racetrack.

            Upvoat for you. CT is famous for some other famous events involving small children....trauma based mind control a few years ago...FF
           </p>
           <p>
            When I hear a small plane goes down I immediately think of JFK jr. Whose plane just happened to crash in water killing him and all witnesses when he was on the eve of becoming Senator for New York...that is right just shy of the mark. Thank God Hillary Clinton was just leaving the Whitehouse as First Lady and could slide right over and capture the victory in the hands of defeat.
           </p>
           <p>
            Stunning since uncle suddenly died just years before as Bill was making his way to the Whitehouse. Even stranger is that Hilary would actually mention Uncle Kennedy tragic assasination while running against Barack Obama a few years later as the reason to hang in to the last moment.
           </p>
           <p>
            Most concerning is that JFK jr was determined to identify his fathers assasin. He was not buying the whole Warren Commission Dulles report since JFK had just fired Dulles for the Bay of Pigs debacle and stated he would break the CIA into a thousand pieces.
           </p>
           <p>
            Odd he would not trust Dulles to investigate his fathers death??
           </p>
           <p>
            JFK jr stated I know who killed my father and I am going to identify him.
Then suddenly he created a strange magazine and names it GEORGE....wonder why he chose that name?
           </p>
           <p>
            Well he died I guess it is a clue we have to learn from. 
Dead men of honor find ways of talking....

             I'm a little confused which uncle you mean. Maybe I am mistaken but I thought that uncle Teddy  and sister Caroline were some of first to endorse Obama when Obama ran against Hillary, and Ted died shortly into Obama's first year. Their endorsement surprised me at the time. Yes, certainly JJr would have known who killed his father, I can't imagine that his mother never discussed it and she had to have known. I mean how could she not? Bailey's Beach is all old OSS/CIA families. She was probably the one who told JFK much of what they secretly do.
            </p>
            <p>
             And yeah, CT is quite bad, of course the Bush family lived there before the move to TX and its home to all the hedgefunders, Comey, Manafort,

            doom. There's a lot going on in that state. An 81yo pilot? And the plane augers in nose first in the forest. Who knows if Christopher  and Bemer crossed paths during Christopher's career. Bemer followed short track racing for many years before purchasing the Speedbowl in 2014.  I've been keeping track of the  pre-trial dates for all 3 involved in the Bemer case. They just keep postponing them monthly.  At Bemer's first pre-trial appearance he was escorted to court by a body guard. Is he afraid of his "fellow elites"?

            CT is rife withe gang activity and drugs. Also, it's the Home of Yale, and Aaron Hernandez.

            I know there is more there with Ability Beyond, the company that runs the home where the individuals lived that were solicited. I just haven't had time for in depth research.

             Whiting Hospital (psyche ward) at Connecticut Valley Hospital has had the entire staff arrested and/or fired for harassing and tormenting patients in the past few months, about 35 employees. Crazy fucking shit going on. All these loose ends probably tie together somehow.

              I've driven past this place and it gives me a bad vibe.
So does the CT juvenile training school right next door and the riverview children's hospital.

            Anytime I hear about a plane crash, my mind automatically goes to the Clintons.  It would not surprise me one bit if there was indeed connections.

             There has been a lot of small plane crashes (at least ten, most fatal)  in CT in the past few years, I meant to look for my earlier completion of them since posting this but I had some real life intervene.  I would guess that these are either "customers" or potential court witnesses. Or maybe there is a aircraft mechanic in CT with a grudge?
