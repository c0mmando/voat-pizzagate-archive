<p>PETERSBURG, Ill. (ChurchMilitant.com) - Stephen Brady, founder and president of newly revived activist group Roman Catholic Faithful (RCF), is speaking out on the Church crisis.</p>
<p>In an exclusive interview with Church Militant last week, Brady discussed homosexual clergy, cowardly bishops and RCF\'s plans to expose the rot in the archdiocese of Chicago. </p>
<p>He described the sex abuse crisis as principally &quot;a homosexual issue,&quot; while faulting &quot;good bishops&quot; for their decades of silence on sexual sin. </p>
<p>&quot;The good bishops, the orthodox — they\'ve got to stand up, they\'ve got to stop respecting man more than they do God,&quot; Brady said. &quot;It\'s as if they fear man\'s law more than they do God\'s law, so you have to question whether or not they believe in damnation and Hell and what the Church teaches in that sense.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;God bless the former papal nuncio that stood up,&quot; he added, praising fugitive whistleblower Abp. Carlo Maria Viganò. &quot;If every good bishop had the courage he had, he would have so many soldiers behind him, fighting!&quot;</p>
<p>When asked by Voris why he thinks so few bishops are willing to stand up for Catholic truth, Brady replied: &quot;I think their faith is weak, for one thing.&quot;</p>
<p>He also suggested that luxury has bred an aversion to suffering among some members of the hierarchy: &quot;[O]bviously, they\'re living a lavish lifestyle, some of them, as a bishop, as a cardinal, and I think they fear losing that.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;But,&quot; he added, &quot;it\'s beyond my understanding as to why they won\'t stand up if they truly believe and accept the Catholic faith, and the fact that you have to carry your cross just as Christ did if you want to follow Christ.&quot;</p>
<p>Brady recounted: </p>
<pre><code>I did have a bishop who said I could never mention his name, gave me some private phone numbers and some information I could use in fighting some of these fights, but still, his exact words were, &quot;Steve, I\'ve got to sit next to these people sometimes&quot; — he meant the conferences in Washington, D.C. or wherever they held them. So again, it\'s sad that they don\'t seem to have that drive and motivation. It\'s just like you and me here — it should be two bishops here, standing up and saying, &quot;Come to us; we\'ll tell you who will do something, who won\'t,&quot; but I think if they did that, the powers that be would strip them of their authority and just throw them out into the street.
</code></pre>

<p>&quot;The Catholic Church has become nothing more than a billion-dollar bank for the homosexual movement to use,&quot; Brady reflected. &quot;They can\'t believe in the Catholic faith, because they couldn\'t believe in the Catholic faith and in the teaching of the Church and the fact that mortal sin and Hell exist and do what they do?&quot; </p>
<p>&quot;There are a lot of priests and bishops, we know, that don\'t accept the Catholic Church — they\'re imposters, and they need to be run out and exposed,&quot; he continued. &quot;The cardinal in Chicago, in my opinion, is one of them.&quot;</p>
<p>Brady explained the importance of flushing out corruption in the archdiocese of Chicago.</p>
<p>&quot;Chicago is such a big hub of the entire country,&quot; he said. &quot;Chicago, as Malachi Martin told me — so much money to the Vatican from this country comes through Chicago, and ... the big scandal with the Vatican Bank years ago started with Chicago priests.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Chicago plays a big role,&quot; he said, pointing to its impact on other U.S. dioceses. &quot;I hate to put it this way, but if you bring down Chicago, which we will do ... the rest may get in line.&quot;</p>
<p>To illustrate Chicago\'s influence on his own diocese, Brady recounted Roman Catholic Faithful\'s campaign against former Springfield Bp. Daniel Ryan, a notorious homosexual predator.</p>
<p>&quot;It\'s just like when we brought down Bp. Ryan,&quot; he said. &quot;I say that in a loving way because nobody loved Bp. Ryan enough to tell him the truth. Nobody loved that man [enough] to save his soul.&quot;</p>
<p>Illustrating Chicago\'s influence on Springfield, Brady continued:</p>
<pre><code>Bishop Ryan was known as a sexual abuser when he was a priest at Joliet before he was ever sent to Springfield. So here comes the hierarchical end of it. When you\'re promoted to the rank of bishop, a morality report has to be sent in to the papal nuncio. People have to verify your moral standing. He was publicly known as an alcoholic — I mean, that can happen to anybody, but you don\'t belong being a bishop if you\'ve got an alcohol problem. He was publicly known as a predatory homosexual back in Joliet when he was chancellor. So that just showed us back then how corrupt the hierarchy already was, and it all stemmed from Chicago and their influence on the entire country.
</code></pre>

<p>Brady and his team are launching a broad campaign to identify and uproot corruption in Chicago.</p>
<p>&quot;We\'re going to be contacting every priest within the archdiocese of Chicago,&quot; he said. &quot;We\'re going to go to every gay community hangout that we can. ... We want to contact these people — we\'re not condoning the lifestyle, but they deserve the truth too ... a lot of them were victims, as well.&quot;</p>
<p>Brady explained that once RCF talks to Chicago clergy and laity who &quot;know where the skeletons are buried,&quot; Cdl. Blase Cupich himself will be investigated.</p>
<p>&quot;We\'re going to do a background — and I want the cardinal to know this — we\'re going to do a background on the cardinal,&quot; Brady pledged. &quot;He\'s going to have a background check he\'s never had before.&quot;</p>
<p>Steven Brady may be the man to take down Chicago, but he has made then aware.  Not Good.  I am frightened for him.   Video Included.</p>

             Thanks so much.  Looking into it.   I am upset with the homosexual push and their allowing so many of them as priests to take over the Vatican as well.  But I do not want to exclude Catholic homosexuals from going to the Church or letting them know they are welcome.  Welcome though does not mean hanging rainbow banners over a Cross or in the Sacristy.  The takeover has to stop.  There has to be some kind of settlement on this.  Hatred for others should not be spread but the ones taking over the Church need to be stopped and put in their place.   Thanks again.  I loved the Traditional Mass with all the trimmings.  Am looking for a Church in my area  that still practices the Traditions. They are quickly fading. Hopefully the Speaking Out of Catholics and Demands of the Faithful will embolden Priests to step forward and go back to Tradition.  Stepping away from it made the Mass mundane and boring.

             Those that are Catholic should read this report.  It is long so skip around if you like. But it show the Narcissism of bergoglio when he changes the words at the end of the Our Father.  A prayer that has been around for 2K years and he takes it upon himself to change the words of Jesus.
            </p>
            <p>
             Let there be no mistake about it: Although he is hiding behind the pretext of a better translation, the fact is that Francis seeks to change the words of Christ Himself. Our Lord truly said, “Lead us not into temptation.” But perhaps Mr. Bergoglio will soon echo the claim recently made by the Jesuit Superior General “Fr.” Arturo Sosa, namely, that we don’t know what Christ really said since there was no tape recorder around.

             If you are not Catholic read a little of it to at least realize what is going on with this Jesuit that wants to change the teachings and prayers of the RCC.  Yours Church or House of Worship is doing the same.  This imo is a frightening time for all of us that believe in God.  We all must hang together to protect Our  Faiths.

             I know.  I said that to my husband last night.  Cupich is walking on a tight rope though.  Even if something happens to Brady, The group is committed.  There is plenty fueling their passion. It goes back 20 years.

            Yes, it's all part of the hidden gay agenda.
           </p>
           <p>
            I was completely fooled by the emphasis on people should be able to fall in love and marry who they choose. Fundamentalists warned about the ramifications of what opening the floodgate would bring, but I brushed it away. I knew/know gay people and knew/know they are good people. But they were used as the Trojan horse.
           </p>
           <p>
            This is a well-orchestrated plan. I remember a very detailed article I read about how this hidden gay agenda "normalized" the entire topic of people being gay. The article has been scrubbed as has the name of the man who constructed the plan of calling/accusing/outing everyone as gay. This was going back a few decades so people like Whitney Houston, Kelly McGillis, and everyone else in the entertainment industry was tagged with rumors about Whitney getting into a lover's spat with McGillis. The man admitted that it was the plan ... to dilute the power of saying someone were gay and it worked. If you think about it, it's the same strategy used in the #metoo movement. The strength of those original charges against Weinstein has all but disappeared under a barrage of meaningless whining.
           </p>
           <p>
            The Church was the perfect vehicle to use. It's cloaked in secrecy, has power, puts individuals into positions of working with children in an unsupervised setting, and is its own police force ... or believes it to be. Many people warned of the gay invasion into the priesthood. They also warned of black masses, etc. But this isn't about being gay per se, it's about the agenda and goal of this perversion of institutions, morality, and laying the groundwork for making an adult having a sexual relationship with a child legal.
           </p>
           <p>
            This was discussed in the 50s. I ran across a famous writer who used this theme of removing the stigma of being gay as a central plot point in a book he wrote. I believe I saved the links and was going to write a post, but never seem to have the time.
           </p>
           <p>
            Thanks for this post. I look forward to a follow up on this. I want to hear exactly what went on and have this scum and the scum's cabal exposed. I also wanted to mention that I saw a few gay men wearing freemason t-shirts lately. I wasn't expecting it and don't remember the inscriptions. Believe it mentioned a year and the lodge number on it. They were walking by at night and the symbolism caught my eye. Then I saw the lodge number and year of its founding.
           </p>
           <p>
            Just throwing that out there. I've infrequently seen freemason apparel ... and never seen any applicable to a gay lodge.

            The American group Legatus announced Thursday that it would withhold $1 million in donations in the midst of the controversy, saying that they want clarity on how the Church is going to proceed in investigating the abuse allegations.
