<p>pizzagate related for crimes and corruption conducted by Clinton as Secretary of State, contents of the hidden emails....</p>
<p>**
<strong>Documents reveal Clinton interest in visiting Venezuelan dictator Hugo Chavez, North Korea’s King Jung II</strong>**</p>
<blockquote>
<p>(Washington, DC) – Judicial Watch today released 1,606 pages of documents from the U.S. Department of State revealing repeated use of unsecured communications for classified information and numerous examples of Clinton Foundation donors receiving special favors from former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton’s staff.</p>
<p>The documents, containing emails from the unsecure, non-government account of Huma Abedin, Clinton’s then-deputy chief of staff, also show Clinton or her staff expressing interest in visiting Venezuelan dictator Hugo Chavez and North Korean dictator Kim Jung II.</p>
<p>The documents included 91 Clinton email exchanges not previously turned over to the State Department, bringing the known total to date to at least 530 emails that were not part of the 55,000 pages of emails that Clinton turned over to the State Department, and further contradicting a statement by Clinton that, “as far as she knew,” all of her government emails had been turned over to the State Department.</p>
<p>The documents were obtained in response to a court order from a May 5, 2015, lawsuit filed against the State Department (Judicial Watch, Inc. v. U.S. Department of State (No. 1:15-cv-00684)) after it failed to respond to a March 18, 2015, Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request seeking: “All emails of official State Department business received or sent by former Deputy Chief of Staff Huma Abedin from January 1, 2009 through February 1, 2013 using a non-‘state.gov’ email address.”... [includes descriptions of emails]....</p>
<p>“Pay to play, classified information mishandling, influence peddling, cover ups – these new emails show why the criminal investigation into Hillary Clinton’s conduct must be resumed,” stated Judicial Watch president Tom Fitton. “The Trump Justice Department and FBI need to reassure the American people they have finally stopped providing political protection to Hillary Clinton.”</p>

            One thing that seems apparent to me is that the Clinton machinery had/has an excessive control over the direction of media.

             Blumenthal advised Clinton that the White House “should use this on all the Sunday shows” and “Name Boehner. Force Boehner out.”

            Thank you for this!  Judicial Watch is the only Citizen's Group that seems to be protecting our interests and standing up for the American People.  They are requesting information that is our right to view but is difficult for most normal citizens to know how to obtain.  They are doing the hard work.  Congratulations
