            This was a five eyes meeting. Happens in NZ. They try to be sneaky but they are not. Comey got played. Trump waited until he testified before Grassley and perjured himself then went to LA for his glamor role. AG Sessions then went to FBI and seized his records and tapes including any recordings or videotapes.
           </p>
           <p>
            Sessions has them all that is why they freaked out. When Trump said "Tapes" that is what he meant. Including blackmail tapes. Howdy Doody time.

            That has been my question all along. If what Kim Dotcom says is true, wouldnt that make him unquestionably valuable to Trump? After all, theyre talking Impeachment over his supposed Russia ties, that started with the DNC/Podesta emails.

            Woohoo Howdy Doody, he really did? arrived early with no explanation... And isn't that where Kim Dotcom is?
           </p>
           <p>
            Your topic is high level reaching, and even if a lead, there's nothing we can do with this. But let's play, it's fun:
           </p>
           <p>
            Hypothesis: Comey knows the identity of dotcom
            <br/>
            Hypothesis: Comey doesn't know who he is
            <br/>
            Hypothesis: Comey is Kim Dotcom
           </p>
           <p>
            Pick your choice, and go on...
           </p>
           <p>
            Another: He met dotcom and helped him somehow
            <br/>
            Another: He met dotcom trying to mislead him
            <br/>
            Another: He met dotcom all right, but there was nothing related involved
            <br/>
            Another: He tried to meet him, but dotcom managed to escape
            <br/>
            Another: He managed to avoid meeting him, while dotcom tried to meet
            <br/>
            <em>
             (this is a funny one)
            </em>
            : He met dotcom, but didn't knew that he met dotcom
            <br/>
            <em>
             (having more fun)
            </em>

            <strong>
             is
            </strong>
            Dotcom, so they couldn't actually "meet"
            <br/>
            Another, just name it...

           <blockquote>

             The news, reliable ones, included: Director of FBI arrived in Queenstown, New Zealand on Sunday, April 23, 2017.

             Digging a bit deeper: A spokeswoman for New Zealand Prime Minister Bill English said New Zealand's government is hosting a conference

             The Pizzagate and Politics subverses are in love and would like to get married if that's ok with you. Why? Because they would like to have a child together and still be able to be covered with one insurance plan.

             If you're not ok with non-cis binary non-binary and by "binary" I mean literally a relationship based on 1's and 0's relationships then maybe you should consider reading more The Huffington Post articles.
