I suddenly remembered seeing a pic someone posted saying it was Tony Podesta\'s bedroom with his distinct artwork, box of tissues and teddy bears in the pic. The comment was why would a man with no children have teddy bears in his bedroom.   I thought it was odd that both men had the same set up.  Now I am thinking what Webb said about Epstein.

            So, I know this is a old thread, but has anyone else looked into Georges background? His linkedin says he's a tech salesman, but more on the networking end. He is son of the George Sweigert, an inventor who's life work was the radio you could fit in you're breast pocket nowadays called a cell phone. Pretty sure the guy's brother is David Sweigert.

            Sibel Edmonds, whistleblower and former FBI translator said back in the early 2000's that this is how people are blackmailed. They invite them to sex parties or plant pedo stuff on their computers.

‘The lady walked me straight through into the massage room. It was part of a suite – a shower room, a steam room and another closet-sized room where I later learned the sex toys were kept.

            what he, and others have stated was the teddy bears and artwork were where the cameras were placed, nanny-cam turned into pedo-cam. it helps if you digest what you read before farting it out.

            Webb is the man, for sure. I think I saw a pic like that from pedo island, but I can't find it. Tony's pic. of teddy is easy to find. Would be interesting to compare.
