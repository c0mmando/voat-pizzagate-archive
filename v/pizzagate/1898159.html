<p>On December 19, 2015, a Hillary Campaign worker named Milia Fisher (mfisher@hillaryclinton.com) transmitted to John Podesta (john.podesta@gmail.com) an article written by Amy Dacey, the former Chair of the DNC.  In the article, Ms. Dacey reports that the DNC\'s data was accessed by Bernie supporters and some of the data was exported.  THERE IS NO MENTION OF RUSSIANS OR PRESIDENT TRUMP.  According to the CEO of the DNC (Amy Dacey), the data was stolen by one or more Bernie Sanders supporters.</p>

<p><strong>HERE\'S WHAT HAPPENED WITH NGP VAN, THE SANDERS CAMPAIGN, AND THE CLINTON CAMPAIGN, And here are the steps we are taking to address the problem -- By AMY DACEY</strong></p>
<p>The Democratic National Committee, through its software partner NGP VAN, provides tools for Democratic campaigns that are invaluable and second to none. This week, there was error with that system, however, which led to an incident involving the Sanders campaign. </p>
<p><strong>We want to lay out exactly what happened</strong> so that people better understand why the DNC needed to suspend the Sanders campaign’s access to our system and how we’ve been working to fully resolve a serious problem — and get everyone back to work electing a Democrat to the White House in 2016. </p>
<p>On Wednesday morning, NGP VAN applied a new software patch to the DNC’s voter database system, and <strong>because of an error in the code, users were capable of accessing some limited, yet extremely valuable information belonging to other campaigns</strong> for a very brief window of time. Even though the glitch opened access, users still needed to take deliberate steps to seek out such information. </p>
<p>It’s important to make a few things clear from the start. At no point were donor records, financial information, or volunteer data exposed between campaigns. At no point was any data exposed to the public. With the correction of the glitch and further audits by NGP VAN, we are confident now that the data within the system is secure.</p>
<p>Once NGP VAN had taken steps to contain the glitch, <strong>the DNC directed NGP VAN to conduct a thorough analysis to:</strong> </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Identify any users who may have accessed information from another campaign inappropriately,</strong> </p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Pinpoint exactly what actions any such users took in the system, and</strong> </p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Report these findings to the DNC so we would know what, if any, data was actually acquired.</strong></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>As a result of this analysis, <strong>NGP VAN found that campaign staff on the Sanders campaign, <em>including the campaign’s national data director</em>, had accessed proprietary information about which voters were being targeted by the Clinton campaign — and in doing so violated their agreements with the DNC.</strong></p>
<p><strong>These staffers then saved this information in their personal folders on the system, and over the course of the next day, we learned that at least one staffer appeared to have generated reports and exported them from the system.</strong></p>
<p><strong>None of this is in dispute. It’s fully documented in the system logs.  And these details reveal nothing less than a serious violation of the agreements governing the use of this data.</strong>  Underscoring that fact is the point that the Sanders campaign has fired their national data director and indicated further disciplinary actions may be taken pending the results of their own investigation. </p>
<p>When we understood what initially happened, <strong>we asked the Sanders campaign to tell us who exactly accessed Hillary for America information, share their understanding of what data was accessed, describe what was done with that information, and detail how the campaign intended to discipline the staffers involved.</strong></p>
<p><strong>On Thursday, further NGP VAN analysis revealed that it was very likely that A USER HAD TAKEN DATA OUT OF THE SYSTEM DURING THE BREACH.</strong>  [emphasis added]  Upon learning that, the DNC had to suspend the Sanders campaign’s access to the voter file to ensure the integrity of the system.  This action was not taken to punish the Sanders campaign — it was necessary to ensure that the Sanders campaign took appropriate steps to resolve the issue and wasn’t unfairly using another campaign’s data. This temporary suspension was well within the DNC’s authority.  Moreover, the DNC was left with little choice in the matter when the Sanders campaign declined to respond in a timely manner to the requests for assistance with an investigation. </p>
<p>On Thursday, the Sanders campaign did move to fire its national data director.  But we still weren’t provided the information we needed from the campaign until late in the evening on Friday. Once they complied with our prior request and provided documentation that we were then able to review, we immediately restored the Sanders campaign’s access to the voter file — as was always our intention and as we had advised well before they sued the Committee. </p>
<p>And <strong>the information obtained so far shows that the DNC’s concern to have a full, thorough inquiry was fully justified:  As confirmed by the Sanders campaign in the account given the DNC Friday evening, one of the employees of the campaign involved in the misconduct tried to delete the notes they made recording their accessing of Clinton campaign data to hide his activities.</strong></p>
<p><strong>The next step is to continue to investigate the incident with the help of an independent auditor. This is necessary to confirm, as the Sanders campaign has assured us, that the data that was inappropriately accessed is no longer in possession of the Sanders campaign.</strong> The Sanders campaign has agreed to fully cooperate with the continuing DNC investigation of this breach. </p>
<p>The DNC has also instructed NGP VAN to conduct a review process of their internal procedures to identify how this mistake was allowed to happen and prevent further such mistakes. The DNC is currently beginning the process of securing an additional, independent audit by a data security firm of NGP VAN’s procedures. </p>
<p>We are glad that all parties are moving forward and that the candidates and Democrats can refocus on engaging voters to show how our party will continue growing the economy and keep Americans safe. </p>

            I think that even though this doesn't have to do with the DNC emails, it does prove that the Clinton camp was capable of RIGGING voter information in her favor- that's why Bernie lost out.  So yea, Russia wasn't responsible in the primaries, or ever.
           </p>
           <p>
            The DNC email hack may or may not have changed the mindset of voters of the overall election -  but that doesn't discount the fact that
RUSSIA WAS NOT THE CAUSE OF RIGGED VOTER INFORMATION IN THE PRIMARIES!  CLINTON WAS ALREADY DOING THAT TO WIN THE NOMINATION. How is that legal?

            Old news but all the internal talk clearly shows they knew it was being leaked. This means they knew Russia had nothing to do with it.

             , because a link to a "Politico" article is worthless.  Where is the solid proof that this was about the theft of ONLY voter information?  You have no proof.  The two emails to which I linked include the following phrases (in the words of Dacey and Palmieri):
            </p>
            <p>
             -- "users were capable of accessing some limited, yet extremely valuable information belonging to other campaigns"
            </p>
            <p>
             -- "the glitch opened access"
            </p>
            <p>
             -- "THE STAFFER THEY FIRED WASN'T EVEN THE PERSON INVOLVED IN ACCESSING THE MOST DATA."
            </p>
            <p>
             Palmieri refers to it as "the data breach."
            </p>
            <p>
             Neither Palmieri nor Dacey were specific about how much data (and what type) was stolen by the Bernie Bros.  Nobody should believe anything that Politico says, because Politico is a mouthpiece for the very people trying to obfuscate, hide the truth, and confuse the low-information citizenry.

            This is it. This is the smoking gun! This proves that the Russia hack story is bogus and that Seth Rich was murdered for being the leaker. They knew this since December 19, 2015.

            Amy Dacey served as dIrector of Government Relations at SEIU from January 2008 until sometime in 2010 when she hired on with Emily's List, then on to the D.N.C. Regardless of any female rivalries within
the D.N.C. the female dominated Committee was determined that a woman get elected as president.

            I read somewhere that Seth was a super nice person and had friends on both sides of the political aisle. Seth had helped Josh Yuretsky secure his position with the Bernie campaign which was identical to his job . Presumably both worked together when there was no conflict of interest and  presumably discussed the dirty tricks of the Hillary primary campaign and the D.N.C. I wonder if he has anything to say about Seth's role if any in leaking  to Wikileaks and Seth's subsequent death.

             .  I have heard Seth Rich was a nice guy, too.   It's so bloody telling that none of his colleagues at the DNC wants his murder solved.  I am not a criminal and I'm a bit of a simpleton.  But heck, even I would at least pretend to care if I were part of the DNC.  Sheesh,  if for no other reason than to try to appear to be a normal human with a soul.

            There is another significant email, taken from the Podesta Emails, in which **Jennifer Palmieri adds more detail about the Bernie Bros' hack of DNC data.  Palmieri claims that
            <strong>
             four Bernie guys were involved in the hack and "THE STAFFER THEY FIRED WASN'T EVEN THE PERSON INVOLVED IN ACCESSING THE MOST DATA."
            </strong>
           </p>
           <p>
            Palmieri then poses four questions to Sanders, and states, in the end,
            <strong>
             "THOSE ARE ALL FACTS.  NO AMOUNT OF MISDIRECTION CHANGES THOSE FACTS.

           <p>
            We’re glad that the Sanders campaign and DNC reached an agreement last night and that the Sanders campaign has agreed to an independent audit of the data breach.
           </p>
           <p>
            This saga - and having our campaign’s hard work violated by the Sanders’ campaign - has been disturbing to our campaign and the volunteers who worked hard to build a strong organization.  But it has also been a distraction from the issues that the American people care about.   We think those issues should be the focus of the debate tonight: issues like raising wages, access to healthcare, and keeping America safe.  However, given news that Senator Sanders and his team apparently want to make this topic the centerpiece of their debate strategy &lt;link to politico&gt;, here are some questions that should be on the table.
           </p>
           <p>
            <strong>
             1: Why'd your campaign say you didn't store anything?
            </strong>
            &lt;link to Washington Post&gt;
&lt;link to sidekick&gt;
           </p>
           <p>
            <strong>
             The Sanders campaign was able to access (and save) 24 different lists of proprietary Clinton campaign information, as seen in their NGPVAN activity logs.
            </strong>
            Here, for example, is a Sanders staffer searching for and saving &lt;link to Audit Sheet on Scribd&gt;a list
of voters that the Clinton campaign identified as persuadable in Iowa.

            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            Let’s be clear about how the VAN system works: when you look at the log, “saving” means an attempt to store the data to your own account–and there are reports that there were preliminary attempts to export the data into excel sheets.  They knew what they were doing.  Which brings me to my next point.
           </p>
           <p>
            <strong>
             2: Why'd your campaign claim it was an accident?
            </strong>
            In an interview with Bloomberg yesterday, Tad Devine claimed this was all a “mistake.”
&lt;link to Bloomberg&gt;
           </p>
           <p>
            A mistake?
           </p>
           <p>
            <strong>
             NGPVAN’s audit found that Sanders staffers conducted 25 targeted searches of Clinton campaign data, just like the example above.
            </strong>
            Let me reiterate what this being a “mistake” would mean.  Take a look at this pull out from the audit activity logs.
           </p>

            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            For this to be a “mistake,” the Sanders campaign would have had to  accidentally…
           </p>
           <ul>
            <li>
             Searched for the voters we've identified as being unlikely to support Hillary Clinton in the South Carolina primary
            </li>
            <li>
             Saved that list into their own account folder
            </li>
            <li>
             Searched for the voters we've identified as supporters who are very likely to turn out to vote in the South Carolina primary
            </li>
            <li>
             Saved that list into their own account folder
            </li>
            <li>
             Searched for the voters we've identified as supporters who are unlikely to turn out to vote in the South Carolina primary
            </li>
           </ul>
           <p>
            This is just a sample. They pulled
            <em>
             21 more lists.
            </em>
            That seems hardly accidental to me.
           </p>
           <p>
            <strong>
             3: Why did the Sanders campaign claim that only
            </strong>
            &lt;link to Gawker&gt;
            <strong>
             one staffer was involved
            </strong>
            &lt;link to Gawker&gt;
            <strong>
             in accessing Clinton campaign data?
            </strong>
           </p>
           <p>
            <strong>
             Contrary to their claims, there were four
            </strong>
            &lt;link to ABC&gt;
            <strong>
             staffers
            </strong>
            <strong>
             involved.  In fact, from the audit logs provided by NGPVAN, THE STAFFER THEY FIRED WASN'T EVEN THE PERSON INVOLVED IN ACCESSING THE MOST DATA
            </strong>
            [emphasis added]
           </p>
           <p>
            <strong>
             4. Why did your campaign claim that the "one staffer" was junior level?
            </strong>
            <a href="http://www.mprnews.org/story/2015/12/19/npr-bernie-sanders-access-restored">
             http://www.mprnews.org/story/2015/12/19/npr-bernie-sanders-access-restored
            </a>
            *
           </p>
           <p>
            In initial reports, the Sanders campaign claimed that the “single staffer” involved in accessing Clinton campaign data was at the junior level. Tad Devine even went so far as to say that he’d never met the guy.
           </p>
           <p>
            Josh Uretsky, the staffer who was fired, was the campaign’s most senior data strategist. &lt;link to Josh Utesky's LinkedIn page&gt;
           </p>
           <p>
            From his Linkedin page: [image: Capture (2)]
            <a href="https://m.hrc.onl/briefing/Capture-2.png">
             https://m.hrc.onl/briefing/Capture-2.png
            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            Our data director is involved in our strategic, day-to-day decision making. That’s a pretty broad interpretation of junior.
           </p>
           <p>
            In conclusion...
           </p>
           <p>
            To most voters, this will all seem pretty arcane. They care about raising wages for their family. They care about security for their family. They care about who’s going to keep them safe.  They certainly don’t spend much time thinking about campaign data theft.
           </p>
           <p>
            With that said,
            <strong>
             if Senator Sanders intends to make his campaign’s theft of our data a rallying point, he should have to answer these questions. His campaign took advantage of a security flaw to access and retain proprietary Clinton campaign information. We don’t know if they still have it. THOSE ARE ALL FACTS.  NO AMOUNT OF MISDIRECTION CHANGES THOSE FACTS.
            </strong>
            [emphasis added]
           </p>
           <p>
            We look forward to tonight’s debate.

           <p>
            This is a pretty convoluted story, here is what we learned from the press:
           </p>
           <p>
            TL;DR:
           </p>
           <h1>
            The system had already been breached in October
           </h1>
           <p>
            and when the Sanders campaign alerted the DNC, nothing was done. The DNC hired this company to run the software for both campaigns. So if info was accessed by the Sanders side, it was done by a parties hired by the organization proven to have rigged the election against him. It's conceivable that it was done to harm him.
           </p>
           <p>
            I know for certain that the Clinton campaign accessed Sanders data. I never give out my cell number, but i did give it to the Sanders campaign to receive text alerts. Once he dropped out of the race, i started getting texts and calls from Hillary campaign, though i absolutely never gave it to them, or the Democratic party.
           </p>
           <hr/>
           <p>
            From an article from someone who knows the software and the story well:
            <a href="https://www.jacobinmag.com/2015/12/bernie-sanders-hillary-clinton-data-breach-president-debate/">
             https://www.jacobinmag.com/2015/12/bernie-sanders-hillary-clinton-data-breach-president-debate/
            </a>
            n an interview with MSNBC’s Steve Kornacki, Uretsky justified the actions of Sanders staff this way:
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             Kornacki: “What we’re able to see from these documents is that people from your campaign — for over forty minutes – were able to access . . . were able to look at, search, and make copies of . . . Clinton supporter lists, from her side of the wall. What is the justification for doing that?”
            </p>
            <p>
             Uretsky: “. . . So I guess what I want to say is that we knew that what we were doing was trackable and we wanted to create a clear record of the problem before reporting it so we could make sure we weren’t crying wolf . . . so that the extent of the exposure of our data, to the other political entities . . . We had to assume that our data was equally exposed and updated reports prove . . . show that it was. We wanted to document and understand the scope of the problem so that we could report it accurately.”
            </p>
            <p>
             Similarly, Uretsky told CNN:
            </p>
            <p>
             In retrospect, I got a little panicky because our data was totally exposed, too. We had to have an assessment, and understand of how broad the exposure was and I had to document it so that I could try to calm down and think about what actually happened so that I could figure out how to protect our stuff.
            </p>

            [Sanders'] Campaign manager Jeff Weaver threatened to sue the Democratic National Committee  after it revoked Sanders' access to its database of voters. The DNC did that after Sanders' team improperly accessed data compiled by the campaign of top rival Hillary Clinton.
           </p>
           <p>
            "This is taking our campaign hostage," Weaver said in a press conference in Washington, a day before the next Democratic presidential debate.
           </p>
           <p>
            Later in the day, the campaign made good on that threat: The Sanders campaign filed a lawsuit in federal court to regain access to the voter data. In the suit, the Sanders campaign alleged that the suspension was costing the campaign at least $600,000 per day. The lawsuit also alleges that the DNC did not provide the Sanders campaign with notice or opportunity consistent with an earlier agreement between the campaigns and the committee.
           </p>
           <p>
            A summary of computer logs showed that four aides to Sanders' campaign accessed voter data compiled by Clinton's campaign, according to The Associated Press. Some of the aides reportedly saved the information. The Clinton campaign said its data was breached by the Sanders campaign in "25 searches by four different accounts," and that the data was saved into the Sanders campaign's account.
           </p>
           <p>
            "This breach is totally unacceptable and may have been a violation of the law," Clinton campaign manager Robby Mook said in a conference call with reporters Friday evening.
           </p>
           <p>
            ..."
           </p>
           <p>
            The Sanders campaign said it had fired a staffer at center of the breach incident — data director Josh Uretsky.
           </p>
           <p>
            Weaver blamed a vendor
            <strong>
             hired by the committee
            </strong>
            — political-data company NGP VAN — for what he alleged was continued "dangerous incompetence." He said he was confident that months ago, some of the Sanders campaign's own data was lost to another campaign.
           </p>
           <p>
            "First, as I pointed out earlier,
            <strong>
             this is not the first time that the vendor hired by the DNC … has allowed serious failures to occur. On more than one occasion they have dropped the firewall between the data of competing Democratic campaigns
            </strong>
            . This is dangerous incompetence.
            <strong>
             It was our campaign months ago that alerted the DNC to the fact that the campaign data was being made available to other campaigns
            </strong>
            ," he said.
           </p>
           <p>
            He added: "Once again, the
            <strong>
             sensitive and important data was compromise because the DNC and its vendor failed to protect it. We have invested enormous campaign resources in acquiring the rights to use this proprietary data
            </strong>
            . But the DNC, in an inappropriate overreaction, has denied us access to our very own data. This is data collected by hundreds of thousands of volunteers across America."
           </p>
           <p>
            Uretsky told CNN Friday that he was only trying to "understand how badly the Sanders campaign's data was exposed" and not attempting to take any of the Clinton campaign's data.

            They knew at that point it was not a hack. All of them knew. They knew not only was Russia never involved it was an inside job and Amy Dacey even suspended activity to make damn sure they figured out who had access to the data. They knew it was exported which means removed to either encryption via (KimDotCom) or on seperate files such as thumbdrives passed off to Craig Murray at American University to Wikileaks or both.

            The FBI knew it that is why they never examined the DNC servers. Seth Rich was unmasked.

            Correct and well spotted. The guy who accessed the data from Sanders' side was one Josh Uretsky who was originally recommended to Bernie by none other than

             .  You're right, it's not any different from what came out in the campaign.   But I never saw it discussed in the Podesta emails by the likes of Davey and Palmieri until today.  In addition, my memory is bad.  I had forgotten about the details cuz so much has transpired since the Democrats' primary.  Coupled with the left's intentional confusion with Russia, I just thought we would all get a jolt from seeing the words straight out of Dacey and Palmieri.

             HIS NAME WAS SETH RICH and, oh by the way, IT WASN'T RUSSIA.

             It's not different, and this has no relation to any of the email hacks. In fact, this wasn't a 'hack'. It was a 'breach'. The door was open and members of Sanders' team walked across the  divide in the database they
             <em>
              mutually
             </em>

             True but not significant. The NGP-VAN system is just a voter database, not an email system. It was only rouge staffers from the Bernie campaign, not a proper conspiracy. This is a nothing burger. I remember the voter info not being available shortly after Iowa.

               No, this is a voter data breach by a possible plant within the Sanders campaign, whom was immediately fired. My understanding is this could have been the entry point needed to get SANDERS' voter data but was made to look like it was wrongdoing on his part. The door was open both ways, and we are asked to believe reports by DNC connected groups saying only Clintons data was accessed, even if just briefly(The Sanders campaign did immediately tell the DNC/NGP-VAN of the glitch/open firewall, btw.)
              </p>
              <p>
               But why would Team Hillary want the data on who was supporting Sanders? Oh right, the MASSIVE unregistering campaign of 2016 that forced an untold number of Dems onto Provisional Ballots that were uncounted or challenged and thrown away in yuge numbers all through the primary. 126,000 in Brooklyn alone. I wonder what the numbers were nationwide. I saw Bernie Delegates get turned away as having just changed their affiliation to Republican or just were gone from the system. That makes no sense. I saw people that had voted Dem for 40-50 years get turned away as not eligible to vote in the primary because it wasn't an "open primary" and they were now all of a sudden registered Republicans.
