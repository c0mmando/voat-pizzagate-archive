<p>A little history - Gillibrand\'s father is Doug Rutnik, a lobbyist who married into an influential Albany, NY family though he later divorced Gillibrand\'s mother.  Rutnik, an attorney, was employed for 4 months by NXIVM, was later sued by Raniere with the case eventually settled for $100,000 (a mere drop in the bucket to these people).  NXIVM is the group that describes itself as a self-help organization but which has been described by others as a cult and multilevel marketing scam.  <a href="http://mobile.wnd.com/2018/03/clintons-received-cash-from-cult-leaders-who-brainwashed-sex-slaves/">http://mobile.wnd.com/2018/03/clintons-received-cash-from-cult-leaders-who-brainwashed-sex-slaves/</a>  We are aware that Raniere was recently arrested in Mexico and charged in a complaint that was unsealed on 03/26/18 with blackmailing and financilaly coercing a subgroup of female followers referred to as &quot;sex slaves.&quot;  
</p>
<p>How is it that Gillibrand\'s father or anybody else connected to her did not have any idea in 2004 that NXIVM involved a secret sex-slavery component, when in 2003, a Forbes article had already publicized allegations that Raniere\'s operation was a &quot;cult,&quot; and an earlier company Raniere had founded had been sued in 1993 by the New York AG who alleged that it was a pyramid scheme?</p>
<p>Chele Farley is the Republican running a longshot 2020 campaign for Democratic NY Senator Kirsten Gillibrand\'s seat.  Farley attacked Gillibrand for claiming ignorance about the exisitence of NXIVM and her father\'s ties to the group.  Farley stated, &quot;For Kristen Gillibrand, the self-procalimed #MeToo Senator, to claim ignorance about a notorious sex-slave cult in her own backyard, is simply hard to believe.&quot;

<p>Gillibrand currently promotes herself as a bold next-generation progressive, however her political career began with working for Republican NY Senator Al D\'Amato and current Democratic Governor, Andrew Cuomo, AND Hillary Clinton. D\'Amato and Cuomo were family connections.</p>
<p>Regarding Gillibrand\'s association with Hillary, 2 accounts of the story say two different things.  One account asserts that Gillibrand\'s father helped her get a job with Hillary\'s 2000 campaign and that Gillibrand was not &quot;on the inside track&quot; with HRC until a cocktail party conversation between Clinton and her father. The second account asserts that Hillibrand came to Hillary\'s attention by volunteering and fundraising for the 2000 campaign and that the cocktail party conversation happened after the campaign was started.

<p>On 03/27/18, a Gillibrand spokesman reiterated a November statement to the Post claiming that she knew nothing about the lawsuit between Raniere and NXIVM - &quot;Senator Gillibrand had never heard of this group until she recently read about them in the newspaper. She is glad that federal and state prosecutors have taken action in this case.&quot;
<a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-5552571/New-York-Senator-Kirsten-Gillibrands-father-tied-sex-cult-leader-just-arrested.html">http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-5552571/New-York-Senator-Kirsten-Gillibrands-father-tied-sex-cult-leader-just-arrested.html</a></p>
<p>Let\'s face it, Chele Farley is right.  How can someone whose home town is Albany, and everybody in Albany has known about NXIVM as it has been blasted on front page headlines in the past say they never heard of it?</p>
<p>And the NCXIVM case continues to become more strange.  According to the criminal complaint against Raniere, the sex-slavery cult within NXIVM was called &quot;Dominos Obsequious Sororium&quot; (DOS), which loosely translates to &quot;Lord/Master of the Obedient Female Companions&quot; or &quot;Master Over the Slave Women.&quot;  Founded in 2015, DOS collected &quot;collateral&quot; from each member - such as damaging personal information or nude photographs - and threatened to release it if members did not have sex with Raniere.  It has also been reported that Raniere targeted &quot;young, vulnerable women.&quot;</p>
<p>One of the highest-ranking members of DOS is reported to be the 35-year old actress, Allison Mack, best known for playing &quot;Chloe Sullivan&quot; on the CW series, &quot;Smallville.&quot;  According to the NY Post, Mack was recruited into NXIVM in the mid 2000\'s by her &quot;Smallville&quot; costar, Krisitn Kreuk, who subsequently left the organization.  Mack reportedly stayed on and became part of Raniere\'s inner circle, used by Raniere to lure other women into the cult.  Cellphone footage of Raniere\'s Puerto Vallarta, Mexico arrest shows Mack and other women planning to follow a police vehicle as it takes Raniere away.

<p>It has been estimated that at least 12,000 people have attended NXIVM classes.  Notable clients are Richard Branson, Antonio Novello (former Surgeon General), and Vincente Fox\'s daughetr, Ana Fox.

<p>Here is the legal Complaint against Raniere:

<p>On Tuesday, 03/27/18, Raniere did not make an argument for bail during his initial court appearance in Fort Worh, TX, clearing the way for his transportation to Brooklyn to face bail and preliminary hearings.  Raniere will be &quot;removed to the Eastern District of New York in the custody of the United States Marshal Service,&quot; said a spokesman for the US Attorney\'s Office.

<p>Parts of the government application to Judge Gold reads:
&quot;According to confidential sources, the defendant had repeated sexual encounters with multiple teenage girls in the mid-to-late 1980\'s and early 1990\'s.  In one instance, the defendant met a 15-year old girl while he was in his 20\'s and had repeated sexual contact with her.  
</p>
<p>In another instance, the defendant met a twelve-year old girl whose mother worked for the defendant and began tutoring her.  Shortly thereafter, the defendant began having regular sexual intercourse with her, including at his home where he lived with multiple adult sexual partners.  One of those partners hired the girl to walk her dog, giving the defendant daily access to the girl.  The defendant told one of the DOS slaves he believed the age of consent was too rigid and that it should be lowered to when a child\'s parent says the child is capable of consent.&quot;

            Good angle on potential political fallout from this story.
           </p>
           <p>
            I want to quibble a bit with this though:
           </p>
           <p>
            'How is it that Gillibrand's father or anybody else connected to her did not have any idea in 2004 that NXIVM involved a secret sex-slavery component, when in 2003, a Forbes article had already publicized allegations that Raniere's operation was a "cult," and an earlier company Raniere had founded had been sued in 1993 by the New York AG who alleged that it was a pyramid scheme?'
           </p>
           <p>
            Raniere's 90's company was a classical pyramid scheme, more about economic exploitation than sexual. The sex slavery component of DOS only got revealed recently, a few months ago. I think the branding and coerced sexual behavior of these supposed empowered feminists really captured the public imagination.
           </p>
           <p>
            By the way, I think the name DOS for his sex slave club might have been a programmer's joke (Disk Operating System, the clunky operating system for the original PC, before Windows).

             Interesting list. Frank Parlato (sp?) appears to have the inside dirt on DOS.

             Wasn't aware really there were so many male slaves also and cuckolds. What a fucked up bunch of people.

             I wonder if this was the guy with the "get any girl" ad in the back of the magazines?  Seriously, for the most part, those are very attractive, very successful women.  They were groomed early, their careers nurtured and protected.  And now they are the ones that didn't get rendered into adenochrome or pizza sauce.  White girls....
