            Bah...conspiracy theory....a satanic shadow government intricately tied to the media programming? Why that's preposterous...we all know that church Crowley was part of, attended by politicians and entertainers....they quietly closed their doors many years ago and gave up their aspirations of corrupting and ruling the world. All that talk in Crowley's books about Human sacrifice and exhibitions of depravity to gain magical powers...even though Ms. Abromovic who performs those weird parties entertainers and poltiicians today attend, claims to practice Crowley magic....the notion is preposterous. I mean if they were controlling the media industry and politics...then they would certainly let us know through those venues if they were doing evil behind the scenes and using the dark arts of deception they practice. By the very name of their church....the occult, which means hidden; it would be obvious if they were operating in society.  (sarcasm)

             I said nothing about controlling the media and politics although thanks for that. I have had personal experience with this and I can tell you that many influential people practice ritual abuse.Guess you may need to check out Michael Aquino

             </a>
             or better yet look into this documentary a German film  crew made on ritual abuse in France and Belgium. Granted it is long but the interviews with victims is bone crushing and you will never again see things the same.

              "It takes courage to change your mind on a subject, but when evidence is overwhelming, you can't be blind anymore unless one chooses ignorance"  - Tell me about it.  There are still people who think these guys are really up on an international space station, even with those obvious solar flare after effects added to the illusion, they can't seem to make the realization this is an actor on a studio set here on earth....

              or this isn't really a video taken by a space ship on its 30 million mile journey to Mars...from way, way up there in the sky...

             </p>
             <p>
              Or that this guy is an actor...he did not witness a bullet as big as your finger sticking out of someone's leg at the shooting seen on TV.
              <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VaH6cL0E4k8&amp;feature=youtu.be">

              </a>
              Nor did this doctor pull bullets bigger than the usual gunshot wounds out of the victims...wonder if he's pulled any bullets out of anything if he thinks the bullets from an AR 15 are bigger than the average bullets he pulls out of people?  The .223 has about the smallest bullets used by the public....more than half the size of most 9mm pistol rounds.  Might also note the greenscreen at the beginning.

               Yes, we will never be truly free until all of the truth comes out.
              </p>
              <p>
               And as dramatic as the political theatre is in the public sphere, at some level, these elite are all working together to suppress knowledge and enslave the masses.
              </p>
              <p>
               The paedophilia and human slavery needs to be addressed and ended immediately, but it will be when people realize the true nature of this earth, that we will see permanent, positive change in this world.

            More and more will come out and I notice even people here are reluctant to believe this could be going on.I was once resistant to believe it as well but there is too much evidence and I wish more investigators took this seriously.
