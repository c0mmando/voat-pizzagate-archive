<p><strong>Excerpts from the article:</strong></p>
<p>Two teachers union presidents in New Jersey have been reportedly suspended after an undercover exposé appeared to reveal they have covered up child abuse by teachers in schools.</p>
<p>Project Veritas released a video Wednesday that appears to identify <strong>Hamilton Township Education Association President Dr. David R. Perry</strong>, who is depicted as <strong>saying, “I’m here to defend even the worst people.”</strong></p>
<p>The video, which Project Veritas states was recorded on March 27, appears to show <strong>Perry explaining to an undercover journalist how he would protect a teacher who had physically abused or threatened middle school students from termination</strong>.</p>
<p>According to the video, <strong>Perry says a teacher accused of abuse must not tell anyone about the incident, but should see him in order to create a story about the abuse that would best protect the teacher.</strong></p>
<p>Perry said his strategy of altering the facts of the incident would “bring it down a level.”</p>
<p>“We do turn [these reports] around to where, if it was a physical punch, it wasn’t a punch. It was a shove,“ Perry appears to say in the video.</p>
<p>“If [the teacher] comes to me tomorrow, I’m gonna date the report to the day after the incident,” he also is depicted as saying.</p>
<p><strong>Perry states he needs the physically abusive teacher to tell him everything because he “need[s] to know the truth so that we can bend the truth.”</strong></p>
<hr />
<p>In a second video, Project Veritas appears to show <strong>Union City Education Association President Kathleen Valencia explaining that the union has assisted a teacher who allegedly had sex with a teen girl from being fired.</strong> Valencia is depicted as stating she would also help a teacher accused of physically abusing a student in the same way.</p>
<p>On March 27, Valencia tells the Project Veritas undercover journalist why a teacher accused of bruising a student in school would not receive a reprimand.</p>
<p>“Did the kid’s parent come in? No? Nothing happened… There’s no video? Nothing happened… [The teacher] is fine,” Valencia appears to say.</p>
<p>If a student speaks out about the alleged incident, Valencia says, “God forbid the kid decides to tell the principal. It happened two weeks ago, he’s not [going to tell.] Let’s say the kid does. [The teacher] is going to be like… ‘kid tripped and fell.’”</p>
<p><strong>Valencia also tells the Project Veritas journalist she has “a file right here … from a teacher who had sex with a student … This file is about whether or not the teacher gets to keep his pension. Is he going to jail? No. How come? Because the child’s not pressing charges. There’s no proof.”</strong></p>
<hr />
<p>NOTE:  I don\'t know how the undercover journalist kept a straight face when Valencia said in an intense whisper, <strong>&quot;Let\'s remember, there is no video.  There\'s no accusation.  There\'s no witness.  That equals no problem.&quot;</strong>  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qCCIJ0tKpIw&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=787">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qCCIJ0tKpIw&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=787</a>  
</p>
<p>Ha!  And is it just me or is she flashing an illuminati hand sign over her left eye when she says &quot;that equals no problem&quot;? </p>

             CCP is Comment Contribution Points. Voat requires a little bit of participation in discussion prior to submission to protect against spam and bot attacks, and make sure folks are somewhat familiar with the culture...Voat isn't quite like anywhere else on the internet. :-) You get one point for each comment, and people can up or downvote you. I'm upvoting your comment to help you get started. Welcome!
