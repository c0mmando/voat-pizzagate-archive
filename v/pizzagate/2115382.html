            Thanks for posting this.  The more we bring up the criminal corruption of Racine the more people learn.  People that have never read of what is going on there.  Many of us have read the reports of the Truth Speaker but not enough.

            Great comment - this is very interesting and involves officials and their associates who are known to be engaged in extreme criminal activity and cover-ups. We can attest that nothing in Racine is done for good, only for show. It is a completely controlled community. The chain of command is Rothschilds &gt; Rockefellers &gt; Johnsons (Racine, WI) through the Pilgrims Society and other networks involved.

            Thanks for the information. That's so creepy, I have an intense distrust of these types of campaigns. If you dig down a bit they always have an ulterior motive. Always.

            This is normal for Racine. Women and children go missing, are murdered, and are abused regularly in the area. It is a cesspool of extreme corruption, trafficking and abuse.
           </p>
           <p>
            Racine and Wisconsin are the "Root" and model of the entire global network. Some main reasons for this involve Paul Ryan and a long-standing coalition between corrupt members of both parties going back to Les Aspin, Jack Lew, the Clintons, McCain, Romney and many others, as well as coalitions among corrupt religious groups including the Vatican, coalitions among corrupt foundations, coalitions among corrupt clubs and organizations including Rotary and United Way, coalitions among various mafia groups including dominicans, franciscans, the Dixie mafia and many others, coalitions among corrupt secret societies including Knights of Pythias, Freemasons, Pilgrims Society, and others, and coalitions among corrupt corporations including SC Johnson, CNH, Cargill, Bayer, Monsanto, ConAgra, Dow, DuPont, Nestle and many others. Racine is the central hub where they can all meet in secret, and where they fully control the harbor, interstate and international airport with its own customs office.
           </p>
           <p>
            We are investigating this, and initial leads point to contacts involved in mafia-related racketeering, trafficking and bid rigging for construction companies in the area. Shockingly, this is not even the most important news story of the day in Racine. There are 2 others that are more important, plus a "jaw bone was found" on a road by Lake Michigan which is strange.
           </p>
           <p>
            One is that another corrupt city council member is resigning from the Racine Development Authority who was involved in racketeering, rigged development deals and contracts, crony handouts and kickback schemes, fraud, embezzlement, extortion, bribery, abuse of power, misconduct in office, misprision, open meeting law violations, open records violations, and many other crimes. The two most recent corrupt deals involve a Machinery Row development that was a string of fraudulent activities and kickbacks to friends and associates, and the new Arena deal involving some of the most prominent businesspeople in the area who were linked to illegal campaign contributions and a network of extreme corruption.
           </p>
           <p>
            The other is - Human Trafficking Campaign Wraps Up
           </p>
           <p>
            We exposed this farce long ago, and it has since fallen apart. Now they are winding it down after a complete failure. This was a cover up from the start involving the same groups that are tied to the extreme levels of corruption, trafficking, harvesting and racketeering in the area. These groups are linked to Ashton Kutcher, John McCain, the Clintons, Podestas, Tom DeLonge, Janine Lindemulder, Penn State University, Arizona State University, and many shady corporations, organizations, churches, clubs, foundations and secret societies.
           </p>
           <p>
            Racine is the model for the real Truth and the real Agenda that leads to Global Enslavement built through the lie of sustainability, and the Mark of the Beast enforced through AI and community policing. Clintons were instrumental in using Racine as a model for these programs and many others. The FBI and DOJ were directly involved in obstructing criminal investigations in Racine, and there is no hope for justice in a completely broken and corrupt system. The world needs to know the Truth before it is too late.

              We will never give up, and we are working on something bigger to expose the real Truth and the real Agenda. The only question is whether people want to be Saved, or Enslaved. That is a much more complex and difficult question than most people understand. Please help in any way you can. Shine the light on Racine, Wisconsin - the "Root" of all Evil.

              .  I am consistently on awe of your indefatigable spirit and your commitment to justice.  I drove through Wisconsin a while back and was thrilled by how markedly different the place seemed to be, compared to Illinois.  I am so saddened to learn about Racine and the hideous underbelly of our government.  I applaud you. I wish I could do more to save all the victims.  I wish this were not our reality. . . .

               Racine is a cesspool, but do not be mistaken.  Illinois is within close proximity and they are connected to what is happening in Racine.  All the big players in Illinois and Chicago are playing the same game.  I did a lot of research on St. Louis and a little on Illinois (but not much) but they are connected.  It is really sad.  We have to do the best we can to help expose what is going on in Racine.  Racine is their little model city for their big plan.  I marvel at the courage of

               and am glad they are making some progress.  But we have to assist in the take down before they take down us.

              Just figured I'd swoop in and say thank you for inadvertently outing defango as a shill. I had seen you drop in on one of his streams name dropping racine and you were instantly kicked out of chat. That's all I needed to see.

               Thank you for noticing. We gave Defango many opportunities to come clean, and he never would. He has no response about Racine and short-circuited, because he doesn't know how he is supposed to respond. He is a CIA asset, and Racine is the ultimate Litmus test to find out who is following a controlled narrative. He is one of many we have exposed along the way. We have a deep strategy in play, and are working on some bigger developments. It is difficult to find those who can be trusted. There are some who know the Truth here, and some on various other forums and channels, but they are few and far between. This is very serious, very real, and very dangerous.
              </p>
              <p>
               When someone exposes the Real Truth about Racine - we will be the first to tell you, and we have intimate knowledge and connections to prove whether they are legit or not.

                At the risk of sounding like a broken record, thank you! Am doing what I can to spread the word about Racine. As you know, the frustration is that it falls on somnambulic ears.

             It is the grand-daughter of the woman involved in the abuse, who was living with the man involved in the abuse. There was a sibling there as well, and they found a hidden wall with a pot growing room, so it was likely a drug and child trafficking group. There are many in the area. They are likely related to a group that is known to be involved in mafia-related activities and rigged development deals. The parents are nowhere to be found, and the grandmother is likely hiding or lying about what they did with the children. Racine has a history of pedo crimes, shady foster programs, trafficking, abuse, abductions and kidnappings, ransoms, child torture, murder, and satanic ritual abuse.
            </p>
            <p>
             The concern is that the kids will end up in one abusive situation after the next. Those involved in the child and family services programs in Racine are known to be corrupt or complicit to corruption and abuse.
            </p>
            <p>
             This all happened the same day they announced they are ending the failed cover-up anti-trafficking groups that were linked to Ashton (Chris) Kutcher, John McCain, Tom DeLonge, Caron Butler, Kristin Bauer van Straten and others involved. These groups were called The Fight to End Exploitation, the I-94 Project and Racine Coalition Against Human Trafficking. Those groups were also linked with the development of Sanctuary Cities and Social Justice programs.
            </p>
            <p>
             Everyone needs to know the real Truth about Racine and the secret "Root" of the entire network.

              Yes, I have heard about Racine before, along with the Masonic influence.  Is anyone involved a Mason?

               Many involved are Masons including the past corrupt criminal mayors and city administrators who resigned, the corrupt criminal District Attorney and city attorneys who resigned, members of the corrupt Racine Development Authority who resigned, County Executives and Supervisors who resigned, many corrupt judges and attorneys (some of which ended up dead), corrupt police chiefs and other law enforcement, and the corrupt Attorney General of Wisconsin.

               They all play their role, but the real leaders and puppet masters are much more powerful than all of them combined. The elite control all levels of government, business, religion, and nearly every aspect of life through a complex network of many layers. Everyone is a slave to the system at varying degrees, and no one will do anything to expose it.
              </p>
              <p>
               At the "Root" of Freemasonry, Jesuits, LDS, Kabbalah, Scientology, OTO and all of the other groups involved lies the same ultimate Truth - Racine, Wisconsin is the hub that connects them all, and is the weak link to the entire system that the world needs to know to be Saved before we are all Enslaved.

             They do not usually release the name of the child, to protect the innocent.  But certainly we all know that there is much other information missing.  More info about the parents and where the child was taken.  Is he now in CPS. That would not be good, especially in a town like Racine.

               I see now what you mean.  Yes, that is a huge possibility.  Since they did not release the name it could be for another reason entirely.  Maybe the occupants of the home kept him there to "entertain" officials.  Disgusting happenings that occur in Racine for sure.  We know how sleazy and corrupt they are. Poor child.

                 I don't trust them.  I don't think there are good things in store for that child. I hate to even write those words, but knowing how vicious and vile they are there, we can expect that they will only cause him more suffering.  I am hoping that there are some good left there and he will be saved.

             The Sheriff and local police are DIRECTLY INVOLVED with the networks in Racine tied to trafficking, organ harvesting, and extreme levels of corruption and abuse. They have allowed it all to go on under their noses, and have been bought off along the way.
            </p>
            <p>
             This case is NOTHING compared to the real Truth they are hiding in Racine. The Sheriff is complicit to extreme criminal corruption among his fellow officials and their associates. There is complicity at all levels, and they have partnered with the very people involved in the circles that control the ratlines, mafia, secret societies and groups tied to the networks of corruption, racketeering, trafficking, and other crimes.
            </p>
            <p>
             Since we began exposing the real Truth, an alarming number of officials have suddenly resigned, retired or changed positions with the most recent being the criminally corrupt mayor and his cousin who he hired as the city administrator. They follow the corrupt city attorney, the corrupt criminal District Attorney, the last corrupt mayor and city administrator who tried to commit suicide, a prominent judge who was "suicided", corrupt county executives and supervisors, corrupt city council members, corrupt police officers and chief of police, and many others.
            </p>
            <p>
             Read our other comments about this case. This is very disturbing, however it is minor compared to the real story, real Truth and real Agenda linked to Racine and Wisconsin.

              I know of other ways online to publicize Racine. Most who've not been following closely and don't have the time/ability to do an individual investigation are totally unaware.  Please contact me privately for more.

               That is because we are already dead.
              </p>
              <p>
               We will explain later, and would now if not for our well-founded fear for others' safety. If you stop hearing about Racine, you will know everything we said is True. It is not a distraction or disinformation. It is the ultimate Truth.
              </p>
              <p>
               We know many others have been murdered, tortured, ruined, silenced and abused along the way, and over the course of many investigations and unique circumstances we have discovered certain truths that have connected along the way. Everything leads back to the same very disturbing agenda and network that has infiltrated and infected all of our communities, of which Racine is the model. Nothing is isolated. Everything is linked to a another part of the puzzle. They cannot be underestimated, and have layers upon layers of contingency plans, but time is running out and people need to know the real Truth before it is too late. We are not alone. Others here and in other places know the Truth but few know how Racine is the real "Root" to everything.
              </p>
              <p>
               Some on YouTube have repeated what we have stated - Trump is the literal Trump card for the global agenda. He is directly involved, and compromised through various means. If anyone can prove otherwise and get him to announce a Grand Jury investigation into criminal corruption in Racine, Wisconsin, we would help him expose everything, but that will never happen. He is part of the system. He is a Freemason and connected to many who are involved, including his mafia ties. In Wisconsin, he just signed off on the "Huge" Foxconn deal which is part of the agenda toward global enslavement that we can prove to the world. Amazon was the other most recent. Now the Emanuels are trying to entice Amazon to expand in the area also. They are all working together. Notice how no one ever brings up the Emanuels and how they are middle men to the elite who control major players in DC, Chicago, and Hollywood?
              </p>
              <p>
               Now look at lists of the wealthiest Americans, and see where the Podestas, Emanuels, John McCain, Paul Ryan and others are. What about Ashton Kutcher, Guy Oseary, and Ron Burkle? Try the Clintons. Now try Donald Trump. He must be powerful as President, with so many successful corporations and investments. He is nobody. He could be Somebody if he exposed the real Truth about Racine and the model for Global Enslavement, but he never will.
              </p>
              <p>
               Now go way up the list and see who the top families are, and how they are connected to Racine, Wisconsin. These are the people who are involved, and who controls all of the players down the line. They all do business with each other in various ways - look at who supports "Sustainability" for example. This is Dixie Mafia rules - whoever has the most money and power at any moment is who is in charge. Those who run Racine know their place in the chain of command, but they made some mistakes along the way, and never counted on anyone finding out or having the courage to expose it.
              </p>
              <p>
               Who else is going to expose the real Truth? We are rightfully concerned that no one ever will. George Webb may be a limited hangout but he is about the only one even trying. InfoWars we exposed as controlled long ago. Snowden and Assange certainly aren't exposing the whole truth. Sessions we all knew was compromised. Bernie Sanders we knew was compromised. Hillary we directly knew was involved. Comey we directly knew was involved allong with Loretta Lynch, Peter Kadzik, Andrew McCabe and others down to the Wisconsin Attorney General and corrupt criminal Racine District Attorney.
              </p>
              <p>
               No one is going to do anything unless we Save Ourselves by telling the world the Real Truth and the Real Agenda. This is not about parties or nations or religions. This is about Enslavement and the end of all Hope. Why would we allow this to happen when the answer is so simple. We can't drain the swamp unless we eliminate the "Root" of the problem and expose the Truth through their own model - Racine, Wisconsin.
              </p>
              <p>
               Pizzagate may be the last and best chance for people to understand how deep and evil the Truth really is. We have exhausted all levels of authority - local, county, state and federal. There is no law. There is no order. Once they figure out who is connected and how deep it goes, everything changes. There are so many layers to how this is all connected, that it is easy to see who is being truthful based on how many layers back you peel before they expose themselves as either afraid, compromised, complicit, or involved.
              </p>
              <p>
               We are only afraid for others, and we know who is involved and what extreme measures they willingly go to. There will NEVER be justice. This is much too deep. It is at all levels, and there is no answer except for the entire world to know the truth before they and AI control us all.
              </p>
              <p>
               Musk and Putin are almost right about one thing - whoever controls AI will control the world, but they are leaving out the real Truth. It's about who controls those who control AI. Most corporations, especially public companies, are controlled by their investors and the team is replaceable. These companies are shells for their true masters. They have means to control everyone, and eliminate anyone. You can find out a lot about many of these companies through research, but what about privately-held companies?
              </p>
              <p>
               What is one the largest privately held companies in the world with access to governments and distribution channels in every major trafficking hub in the world? Who are their partners? What do they sell and trade? Most people have no clue what is really going on in the world right now and what is at stake. It is going on right under everyone's noses. On their TV. In their backyard. In their bedrooms, bathrooms and kitchens. They control everything we consume. This is not a conspiracy theory. This is the ultimate True conspiracy. There is no turning back. We need to identify the Truth, the Agenda, and those who are involved at all levels.
              </p>
              <p>
               Time is running out. We need the help of anyone and everyone that cares about the history, present and future of the world. This is the ultimate battle of Good vs. Evil, with the fate of everyone and everything on the line. Only the Truth shall set us Free.

            I have a sinking feeling there i s a lot more of that going on in Racine.  There is so much more as well as we know.  This is not the worst of it as the policeman says.  As sad and sick as it is to lock a boy in a cage, there are way more vile things going on.  Racine is Seedy AND Sick and Corrupt as

              They get away with it because Politicians keep voting their way.  Total Corruption. They keep allowing them to do whatever they want because they get campaign donations and maybe also because they are forced to.  Blackmail can also be used.

               Blackmail, of course. Heard on solid intel Trump was threatened with a JFK ending to his term of POTUS, as well as most of his family and grandchildren especially. Think clearly. Would Hillary or the current VP be an improvement?
