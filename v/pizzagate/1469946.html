            The only debunking that we can consider is the one straigh from the horses mouth. We need counter claims and evidence from James Alefantis, John Podesta and everyone that is implicated. I am afraid people like the Clintons are out of our reach. They are way too powerful  for us, only Trump can deal with them.

             I think they're quiet for a reason.  Anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law.

            <p>
             Note that that doesn't necessarily imply guilt, just that they're playing it safe.  This would be a horrible time for one of them to misspeak even if they are totally innocent.

            I've only looked at a few articles, and not one has mentioned the most controversial findings.  It's obvious that the goal is to make a decision for people who wouldn't be inclined to dig deeper.  They obviously couldn't post the Instagram pics, Heavy Breathing pics, etc., and just hand wave that Pizzagate is fake.

             I was going to say the same thing.  They typically run with the "it's a conspiracy theory by the alt-right that they unveiled just before the election that states that Hillary runs a pedo child trafficking ring out of a small pizza place in DC."
            </p>
            <p>
             How many of those videos or articles give any of the info from the Podesta emails?  None that I've seen because they never looked and they don't care to.

             They've all be completely dismissive and the writers seem to have been following orders.  The orders have been to promote the concept of "FAKE NEWS" (create a 'crisis' to take advantage of the crisis --&gt; censorship).   The lack of journalistic integrity is extraordinary.   Shows why New Media (us) kicked ass this past election.
