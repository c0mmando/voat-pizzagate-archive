<p>Washington (CNN)A federal grand jury in Washington, DC, on Friday approved the first charges in the investigation led by special counsel Robert Mueller, according to sources briefed on the matter.</p>
<p>The charges are still sealed under orders from a federal judge. Plans were prepared Friday for anyone charged to be taken into custody as soon as Monday, the sources said. It is unclear what the charges are.
A spokesman for the special counsel\'s office declined to comment.
Mueller was appointed in May to lead the investigation into Russian meddling in the 2016 election.
Under the regulations governing special counsel investigations, Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, who has oversight over the Russia investigation, would have been made aware of any charges before they were taken before the grand jury for approval, according to people familiar with the matter.</p>
<p>On Friday, top lawyers who are helping to lead the Mueller probe, including veteran prosecutor Andrew Weissmann, were seen entering the court room at the DC federal court where the grand jury meets to hear testimony in the Russia investigation.
Reporters present saw a flurry of activity at the grand jury room, but officials made no announcements....</p>

            Manafort will be arrested if we are lucky so will the Podesta brothers. Forget about Hillary ever being arrested she is Queen of the Cabal but maybe if we are very lucky she will be suicided and it will be made to look like a natural death. That is the best we can hope for with her. She will never be arrested or prosecuted for anything ever. Same with Obama.

             Hillary is used up...she has nothing to offer the cabal anymore....so is as likely to be thrown under the bus as anyone....
            </p>
            <p>
             What worries me most is even if they take some down this will revolve around uranium and Russia.....but it will be business as usual as far as people trafficking and child rape is concerned

             There's a difference being a "subject" of investigation and a target.   Target is almost certain to be indicted.  Paul Manafort had a search warrant served on his house.  He is almost certainly a target and almost certainly facing indictment.  Subjects may end up getting indictment.  Being a witness before a grand jury usually means you are in no legal danger.  So subject is the middle category.
            </p>
            <p>
             Also interesting timing on the new fake uranium scandal.  Almost like Team Trump knew these indictments were coming and needed for their team to be screaming and pointing fingers.

              Well, I actually agree with you. It will be Paul Manafort which will lead to the indictment of Tony Podesta. Can we get your thoughts on the FBI informant that has just been cleared to talk to Congress about the "fake uranium" scandal in which he reportedly has hard evidence including audio and video recordings?

              He's the guy that broke the Howdy Doody story about Comey as you may know. Youtube has taken it down and the Dr. is in youtube jail but still able to post clips. He's been saying he's going to DC for a special meeting that would be sensational apparently. I think it was at the FBI bldg. I just watched the clip tonight. I believe he really has sources. Look how Trump talks about "tapes" floating around, "governmental" tapes, in reference to Comey. He's threatening him. Trump knows about the Howdy Doody stuff, I would bet money on it.

                Yeah, I believe it has to do w/ pedo blackmail still. I have a gut sense that the Dr. is for real about his sources.

                 Fascinating! And yes, homosexuality back then was such a taboo it would have made an easy blackmailing tool.

            Hey m'friend, got some goooooooooood news on this front!! Our MegaAnon has delivered again and just said this ---

Haha! Yes, you're right! He's gotta make it look good for the cameras, y'all! I told you this.
           </p>
           <p>
            Trump will never be indicted for anything. Everyone corrupt will and yes, the corruption and swamp is bi-partisan! Manafort worked for Dems longer than Trump and Trump briefly and purposefully brought him in for a very specific reason and no, it's NOT the reason you think.
           </p>
           <p>
            You're going to see establishment Dems AND Repubs go as part of this "investigation", but it won't touch Trump. All the Repubs. who will go down were never Trump supporters. They'll be the John McCain's, Lindsay Graham's, etc. of the establishment.
           </p>
           <p>
            Stop responding to the shills, you're wasting your time. Instead, enjoy your weekends, y'all! You're going to get the rest of JFK, Hillary's emails from the State Department and a new "head of the FED"!
