<p>The time is NOW to call Representatives. This is the first day of NO PAYCHECK from government shutdown.

<p>Currently, the SHUTDOWN is blocking the FRAUD INVESTIGATION REGARDING VACCINES AND AUTISM.

The timing of the release of this sworn affidavit and the government SHUTDOWN is SUSPECT. This will affect every child in America.

<p>&quot;Israel Speeds Up Underground Border Wall To Block Gaza Tunnels&quot; January 24, 20189:08 AM ET</p>
<p>&quot;The Israeli military is speeding up construction of its first underground border wall. The 40-mile-long wall will run the length of Israel\'s border with the Gaza Strip to counter tunnels that Palestinian militants have dug into Israeli territory. Dozens of tunnels, reportedly running dozens of miles long, have been constructed in attempts to infiltrate Israeli territory and carry out attacks, according to the Israeli military. &quot;This is now a significant game changer,&quot; said Israeli military spokesman Lt. Col. Jonathan Conricus. Work on the &quot;obstacle,&quot; as the military dubs it, began last summer. About 2.5 miles are already complete. Now the military says it is accelerating construction, working 24 hours a day, six days a week — breaking only for the Sabbath — to complete the wall by mid-2019.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;On top of the underground barrier, Israel is also building an aboveground border fence. The government is installing sensor technology to detect when militants are tunneling close to the border, the military says.&quot; <a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/parallels/2018/01/24/579180146/israel-speeds-up-underground-border-wall-to-block-gaza-tunnels">https://www.npr.org/sections/parallels/2018/01/24/579180146/israel-speeds-up-underground-border-wall-to-block-gaza-tunnels</a></p>

            If GHW Bush was flying kids and drugs into the airport adjacent to the Branch Davidian Compound in Waco and WJ Clinton was flying cocaine (and more?) into Arkansas, then clearly a Border Wall is not the complete solution. The only thing an above ground border wall does is destroy the CIA's competition. BTW: If you are Deep State, don't worry... I'm completely intoxicated. Nobody will take me seriously! :)

             Obama's Kalorama $8 million mansion (just down the road from seedy Comet Ping Pong and 2 doors down from Tony Podesta) is now a WALLED FORTRESS. Yet, Obama doesn't want Trump to build a border wall. I WONDER WHY? What is the source of his new income?
            </p>
            <p>
             "The Obamas’ purchase of the Kalorama home reflects an extreme example of the upward trend in big-ticket sales around the area, according to Maxwell Rabin, a broker for TTR Sotheby’s International Realty.
“That’s a big number,” he wrote in an email about the home. “It sold in 2014 for $5.3 million.”
Residents have complained of protests against Trump, a deluge of parking problems and photographers that stake out the home of Ms. Trump and Mr. Kushner. But they tend to praise one crucial neighborhood amenity: Crawling with Secret Service agents, Kalorama is really — really — safe.
“Thinking of canceling my alarm service,” the lobbyist Tony Podesta, who lives two doors down from the Obamas, wrote in an email."

Can you document that? That was a long time ago. Maybe they just use TUNNELS now. Besides, TUNNELS BRING IN NOTHING GOOD. Even ISRAEL wants to block them, and they are the SECURITY PROS.  Just building an underground wall gives good excuse and money for the military to be there and continue to thwart the "caravans."

              I support an UNDERGROUND WALL. 
I do like Pink Floyd's tune:
              <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5IpYOF4Hi6Q">
               https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5IpYOF4Hi6Q
              </a>
             </p>
             <p>
              Of course "the wall" is a reference to a school building used for citizen mind control. Keep their mind in a politically correct box. 
An UNDERGROUND WALL is thinking outside the box. SOME OF THE EARLIEST PIZZAGATE RESEARCH WAS ABOUT TUNNELS. Perhaps you have a vested interest in drugs and children coming UNDER THE BORDER, yes?

            "TRUMP'S MEXICO WALL COULD DRAW ON GAZA STRIP BARRIER, ISRAELI MINISTER SAYS AFTER NIELSEN VISIT"
           </p>
           <p>
            "Israel’s barrier includes an underground wall designed to block Hamas tunnels built to allow its fighters to infiltrate Israel. The structure also has sensors to detect nearby digging activity. Similar tunnels exist under the U.S.-Mexico border, used by criminal gangs to smuggle drugs, weapons and even people between the two countries. If Trump’s wall ever gets built, it may use underground barriers to nullify such routes."

            "Israel’s barriers are largely aimed at keeping terrorists out, but another major priority has been to stem the flow of illegal African migrants attempting to cross into the Jewish state along the Israel-Egypt border. To that effect, Israel in 2013 completed construction of a border fence along the Israel-Egypt border, and the numbers of illegals crossing the border massively decreased."

            “If you really want to find out how effective a wall is, just ask Israel,” Trump said. “[It’s] 99.9 percent effective and our wall will be every bit as good as that, if not better.”
           </p>
           <p>
            "A third wall, built with sophisticated tunnel detection technologies, has been established along the border with the Hamas-run Gaza Strip. Israel is also building a similar wall along its border with Lebanon in the north to prevent attacks from Lebanese terror group Hezbollah.
