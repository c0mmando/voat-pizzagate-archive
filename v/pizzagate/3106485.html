<p>The blood-soaked body of a private detective who linked John and Tony Podesta to the disappearance of Madeleine McCann has been found at a mansion in Surrey, England.</p>
<p>Mystery surrounds the death of Washington D.C. based Kevin Halligen, 56, who presented himself as a ‘cloak-and-dagger, James Bond-style spy’ who took on the most difficult cases. Surrey Police confirmed Saturday that a probe has been launched into his death.</p>
<p>FOUL PLAY SUSPECTED</p>
<p>Kevin Halligen took over the private investigation into the Madeleine McCann case in May 2008 and was responsible for linking John and Tony Podesta to the disappearance of the 3-year-old girl in Portugal, sparking frenzied speculation that the brothers, both high-level Democratic Party operatives, were responsible for her murder.</p>
<p>The 56-year-old detective and his partner <a href="https://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/2013/10/27/madeleine-mccann-kate-gerry-mi5_n_4167645.html?guccounter=1">Henri Exton were responsible for the two e-fit sketches</a>, {note - this link only mentions Exton, doesnt name Halligen} that were released in the search for the Madeline McCann abductor(s), and which bore more than a passing resemblance to John and Tony Podesta.</p>
<p>Kevin Halligen’s investigative work into the disappearance of Madeleine McCann revealed that one of the men pictured in the e-fit sketches was seen carrying a young child that resembled the 3-year-old child on a beach in Praia da Luz, Portugal, a popular beach holiday location where Halligen also proved the Podesta brothers were holidaying at the time.</p>
<p>HALLIGAN HAD ‘DIRT’ ON THE PODESTAS</p>
<p>Mainstream media attempted to convince everyone that it was a co-incidence. However the 56-year-old private detective knew more about the Podesta brothers and their secrets than many initially assumed. The British investigator was D.C. based, and worked for Oakley International, an intelligence operation that considered the Podesta Group to be its natural enemy.</p>
<p>Oakley International was based out of 2550 M Street, NW, Washington, DC. This address is also the office of Patton Boggs, Washington’s most politically-connected law firm and lobbyist organization. When Halligan first moved to D.C. in 2005, he hired Patton Boggs to help set up his new business.</p>
<p>Through his close connection with Patton Boggs, Kevin Halligen was more than familiar with The Podesta Group. They are closely connected. Tony Podesta has gone on record on multiple occasions praising Tommy Boggs of Patton Boggs: “He’s a brilliant guy who invented what a lot of us do.” </p>
<p>Nick Allard, Patton Boggs co-chairman also returns the praise for Tony Podesta: “Tony and his group are the right people at the right time in the right place…Tom Boggs invented the lawyer-lobbyist model and Tony perfected it. They are probably the two giants of the modern practice. There is no one else in the same zip code.“</p>
<p>So there is no question Halligen knew about the Podestas and their reputation. Why did he link them to Madeleine McCann’s disappearance in Portugal? What dirt did Halligan have on the two powerful Democratic operatives?</p>
<p>Why did Kevin Halligen, hired by the McCann’s to investigate their daughter’s disappearance, produce e-fits closely resembling (beyond reasonable doubt) his client’s (Patton Boggs) biggest rivals?</p>
<p>Who persuaded – and why – Gerry and Kate McCann to put their faith in a random Washington DC-based private detective, and pay him $500,000, after he reached out to them telling them he could find their daughter?</p>
<p>And why was Gerry McCann pictured <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-471365/After-long-months-daughter--McCanns.html">laughing and joking his way around Washington D.C.</a>, in July 2007 (less than three months after his daughter Madeleine disappeared), lobbying statesmen on child trafficking, kissing Laura Bush’s dog, and generally enjoying the limelight?</p>
<p>Kevin Halligen’s blood-soaked death in Surrey, England this week stinks to high heaven. The man who linked the Podestas to the disappearance of Madeleine McCann appears to have paid the ultimate price for something he did during his 56 years on this earth. Many believe linking the powerful Podestas to the disappearance of the 3-year-old was the moment he signed his death warrant.</p>',

            I think I posted a thread on Kevin Halligen. His close ties to the Podestas is such a bizarre coincidence matched with the e-fits. Then his odd death. He was reported by staff at a bar or restaurant in Washington to come in and drink all day. Drinkers like that don't constantly fall over at home to leave blood everywhere.
           </p>
           <p>
            I also remember when he was arrested and sent to America for trial he desperately wanted to serve his sentence in England. Is this because he feared certain people could get to him in an American prison?

            "Oakley International, an intelligence operation that considered the Podesta Group to be its natural enemy." Patton Boggs. Seems contradictory. Not saying that uzzfeed or Ynews wire are entirely fake. but when I her David Icke as a sometime contributor, I walk away. Sometimes there is much truth, or truth to be had, in the disinformation. David Icke is Sir Richard Branson in Prosthetics.

            CLEMENT FREUD :
           </p>
           <p>
            Clement Freud was a Knight of the Realm like  Jimmy Savile.
‘Sir Clement Freud made a huge contribution to public life in many different ways,’ declared the then Prime Minister Gordon Brown, who got to know Freud when 
he was Rector of the University of Edinburgh and Freud was Rector of Dundee University.
Eight days later, at the funeral at St Bride’s, in Fleet Street, Brown read the lesson from St John’s Gospel and gave an address to a starry congregation that included Stephen Fry, rock star Bono and an assortment of Freud’s fellow panellists from Radio 4’s enduring panel game Just a Minute.
He (Freud) was a familiar, larger-than-life figure punting heavily at the races
(He had an )ostensibly happy marriage that produced five children (and nearly 20 grandchildren) including multi-millionaire PR guru Matthew Freud, whose former wife was Rupert Murdoch’s daughter Elisabeth.
Matthew has certainly followed the family’s dissolute, libidinous path. While married to his second wife Elisabeth, with whom he has a son and a daughter,
 he had another child with one of her close friends. Elisabeth even cradled the child in her arms, not knowing the father was her husband.
Another of Clement’s children is Emma Freud, TV presenter and partner of Four Weddings And A Funeral filmmaker Richard Curtis.Emma and Matthew’s other siblings were Nicola, Dominic and Ashley.
           </p>
           <p>
            His early life
           </p>
           <p>
            The grandson of psychoanalyst Sigmund Freud and brother of artist Lucian, Clement was born in Berlin in 1924, but fled to Britain with his Jewish family when the Nazis came to power.
After the war he trained as a chef at London’s Dorchester, before being made manager of the glamorous Martinez Hotel in Cannes.
His rise to fame
With his finger on the capital's showbiz pulse, he helped propel a number of young acts to stardom and later boasted of being the first person to book the now disgraced entertainer, Rolf Harris.
As one of the country’s first celebrity chefs, he became a regular on TV and became a household name thanks to a series of dog food adverts in which he starred alongside a bloodhound called Henry.
Political power
He later moved into journalism before beginning a 14-year career in the House of Commons in 1973, where he shared an office with Cyril Smith, who was subsequently exposed as a serial paedophile.
Accusations of grooming and sexual abuse
Two separate women came forward to allege that he groomed and sexually abused them when they were young girls.
Freud spent years abusing a girl who he brought up as a daughter, and violently raped a teenager while he was an MP.
His widow, Lady Freud, has apologised to his victims.
           </p>
           <p>
            The western Algarve, with its bucket-and-spade resorts, wide-open verandas and patios, and laid-back security, had become a teeming hive of paedophile activity.
One investigator said he knew of 38 child sex abusers living in the area; and between 2005 and 2009, the children of seven holidaying families were reportedly subjected to sex attacks — five before three-year-old Madeleine was taken from Apartment 5A at the Ocean Club, and two afterwards.

            How Clement Freud invited Kate and Gerry McCann for lunch after Madeleine disappeared

            Madeleine McCann Detective Accuses ex-PM Gordon Brown and MI5 of Epic Cover-up — The Podesta Connection
A former detective who led the initial investigation into the disappearance of Madeleine McCann has sensationally claimed that MI5 helped cover up her death.
Portuguese former police chief Goncalo Amaral, 56, told an Australian documentary that British secret agents “for sure had an involvement” when Maddie vanished at the age of 3 in 2007.
Mr Amaral also astonishingly claimed that former Prime Minister Gordon Brown was involved in the cover up.
The former cop worked on the case when Maddie went missing from the apartment the McCanns were staying in in Praia da Luz while Kate and Gerry ate dinner with friends.
He resigned six months after being removed from the case but wrote a book using police files as he put forward a theory she had died in the apartment.
The McCanns have dismissed this comments and Mr Amaral produced no evidence to support his claims about either the former Prime Minister or the British security services.
The documentary, billed as a “landmark television event”, also suggested that a new key witness – who worked at the Praia da Luz resort at the time of Maddie’s disappearance – was being sought.
The Podestas were staying close-by, at a pedophile friend’s villa and match Police sketches of kidnappers
Police sketches of two suspects believed to be involved in the disappearance of Madeleine McCann, that took place in Portugal on May 3rd, 2007, have made their way around the Internet recently, and they depict what appears to be a drawing of the Podesta brothers.

            This individual, Kevin Halligen was clearly a shady character, and he may have made a number of enemies over the years. However, his association with Gerry and Kate McCann, suspected by many of concealing facts about their daughter's disappearance, is bound to raise questions. Did Halligen learn the truth, and was he threatening to reveal it? Speculation, obviously, but his gruesome sounding death is another strange chapter in this ongoing McCann story.

            Gerry and Kate rented Maddie to the Podestas then they took her without paying full price for her. The parents covered up everything and most likely Maddie was killed but mom and dad knew exactly who took her and where she was disposed of.
           </p>
           <p>
            I very much agree.  This was a Bloody Mess of a Murder no matter when it occurred. We had discovered in the past that Maddy had coloboma and so did G Soros.  Didn't we also discover that her mom had been inseminated?  Who's baby really was Maddy?  Who was the real father?  I propose that's why Gerry didn't mind giving her up.  She wasn't his.But that may just be speculation on my part.  Also I remember that Gerry had a policeman friend that cleaned CP out of Gerry's computer.  Still so many questions without answers.

            I am interested that this article states he linked the podestas to portugal at the time. I recall that they were in a conference in portugal near the time alright but the internet was scrubbed of that fairly quickly ( that or I went down a rabbit hole I cant find since, and trust me I looked )

            don't despair this particular topic is covered on multiple sites and quite a bit of the digging here works its way over.

            We're coming back into election season and sure as shit Maddie comes back up again with this new season on Netflix all while JP is in NZ before the shooting. Maddie is like a dog whistle to these guys. This all started at the same time Obama went to run for office and the efits of the podestas came out just before John took a job with Obama years later. Watch this space we will hear more on this story in the next 12 months 100% guarantee.

             No sauce, but I recall seeing that too....an actual picture of a Podesta (might have been Tony) in Portugal, as you say for a conference, in someone's social media, though I think it was a while before Maddie was taken...I seem to recall that it was dug up from one of the early podesta emails that mentions a trip to europe
            </p>
            <p>
             There was also lots of speculation around them staying with Clement Freud, or being there on the actual date of her disappearence, but no real evidence of that was ever found....though it's clear they knew Freud

             I have not seen a piece of evidence which decisively links Podesta(s) to Praia da Luz around the time of McCann's disappearance.  The association with Clement Freud is highly suspicious.  The e-Fits were damning.  Chances are a hit was put out on Halligen when he released the NSY e-Fits to Daily Mail (?).
            </p>
            <p>
             The e-Fits are evidence which stands on it's on merits.  No one has remotely come close to debunking it.

              There was something I had read....that Podestas emails mention him leaving the country at just the right time. I don't think it specifically mentions Portugal, though. Does anyone recall this? I'm talking like, pg 2016 speculations here.

               I'm pretty sure your recollection is right.  I believe that there was an email between JP and his assistant (maybe) with some basic travel info, referencing a return trip from somewhere.  To the best of my knowledge, there has been no overt links between Podesta and travel to Portugal around the date of McCann's disappearance.

              I guess I'm wondering if the efits were a Fusion GPS "piss dossier" type operation, against the Podestas. This sounds like Halligan knew about them before the efits were created. That's suspicious.

               I have wondered about that too. I mean, they had Tony down TO THE MOLE ON HIS CHEEK. That was what convinced that those efits were the Podesta Bros.I'd love to talk to the e-fit artist, wouldn't you? I. Have. So. Many. Questions.

                I've said all along -- not likely two guys as rich as those two would abduct a kid themselves. As a boater, I've had some interaction with very wealthy people. They have minions for everything. I just don't see it. I've never really been convinced by the efits.

               Check this source out in the OP please. Newspunch are the same people behind clickbait / fake news sites YourNewsWire, NeonNettle, TopBuzz etc.

               Any articles by Baxter Dmitry or Sean Adl-Tabatabai are usually total honeypot, clickbait garbage.

             Thanks.  I'm being sarcastic as I ranted about this event until I was blue in the face when it went down.  I'm curious why it is re-emerging.

             Thanks for the links. Do you have any more verification on the hacking of comet ping pong?
            </p>
            <p>
             My theory is that the efits were deliberately drawn to resemble the brothers. To highlight to those watching the case that the pizzagate pedo ring has her. She will be very valuable to them due to her eye marking they can verify to the elite rich punters that she is madeline mcann. It has helped the pedo ring that she is now so famous. Is this why the government keep throwing millions at them? There is an undercurrent here. I think these detectives knew and the efits were their way of showing the world the REAL culprits.

             you seem pretty archival. Did you ever catch a screengrab of that MI5 or MI6 document showing that UK intelligence confirmed the Podesta's being at Clement Freud's house?

             If only Podesta's wikileaks cache started a few weeks earlier we might have another source for verification....
