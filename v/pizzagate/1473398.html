            One of the problems with this idea is that #pizzagate is completely decentralized and disheveled at this point, and social media is trying really hard to keep it that way by various means. That makes it impossible for newcomers to discern what to look at first. If it's too much of a headache, people won't take the time. So we need a centralized hub of pizza-related material geared for consumption by noobs, not research by weaponized autism.
           </p>
           <p>
            A thought: How about something like a wiki page with an organized index and topics/sub-topics and cross-linking. It's a big ordeal, but imagine passing out flyers with a URL/qrcode that goes straight to a place people can quickly and incrementally learn about everything we know.
           </p>
           <p>
            It would also rule out censorship. Twit, fakebook and utube would have a harder time justifying

            Speaking of evidence searching, I go on to search for micro cameras, is there anything now days, smaller than the Exxon Valdez? 
I had smaller cameras at work 30 years ago.
           </p>
           <p>
            Anyway, I was thinking at this point, our law is out of order and we have to take measures into our own hands that we need to take special steps to catch these people because they sure as hell ain't gonna let us just catch them and we could build a mountain of circumstantial evidence.. Or a planet of it for that matter.. And no matter what, our entire gov is fully invalidated. We are the law now!

            Yeah. Flyers might be good. I engage everyone I know at some level: not necessarily the current research but the long history of child abuse by powerful people. I focus on proven cases and and connections to lay a foundation and then present the speculation.
           </p>
           <p>
            And I use social media - it's not totally censored yet but it'll get you fired I'm sure. Clinton is spinning this right now, and the legacy News is using the FakeNews narrative to its advantage in some ways. I tag old cases of child abuse and such as "FakeNews" from so-called reputable news sources to illustrate how they're ignoring they're own reports.
           </p>
           <p>
            We have to chip away at the mass psyche that basically doesn't want to deal with this information. We have to do this while shills and impatient people will undermine our position. I stress rational arguments and allowing people to,come to terms with it with a bit of patience. This is the last taboo, really.
