<p>The entire premise of #pizzagate is that there is a cabal of evil politicians, probably centered around Hillary Clinton, the Podesta brothers, and the Clinton Foundation. They seem to be involved with child trafficking, and potentially Satanism (&quot;Thelema,&quot; &quot;Moloch,&quot; &quot;Minerva&quot; - all from Wikileaks emails) and cannibalism (Podesta artwork, several other Instagrams).</p>
<p>Well, nobody knows for sure if #pizzagate, as described above, is actually real. But, if it IS real, then we can\'t expect these people to go down without a fight. They are probably licking their wounds from the election night. But, if they are willing to engage in this level of evil (child trafficking), then we would also be willing to do other acts of horrible evil to maintain power.</p>
<p>We are all familiar with FBIanon (who allegedly wrote that everything now is a distraction from the imminent threat of war with Russia) and also with the great youtube videos of George Webb. Webb has been publishing daily videos asking &quot;Where Is Eric Braverman?&quot; who was the CEO of the Clinton Foundation who resigned and seemed to be a whistleblower (&quot;follow the money&quot;).</p>
<p>I have been exchanging messages with Webb on youtube comments, and he recently indicated that he thinks the Clinton/CIA cabal will try to assassinate Trump. In this thread, in the comments, Webb wrote:</p>
<p>&quot;Yes, I believe Trump will be assassinated during Davos, January 17-20th. They will all be in Austria with cover stories.﻿&quot;
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECJhrDoA6Ms">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECJhrDoA6Ms</a></p>
<p>He also said similar things during his day 63 videos (three different parts, released on Christmas day).</p>
<p>Webb went into a scary level of detail. He predicts that a Mexican drug cartel, like La Raza or associated groups, will use Stinger missiles, to shoot down Trump\'s plan. He predicts that this will happen during the Davos economic forum in the three days before inauguration.</p>
<p>Where did Webb get these specific details? Why is he so confident? I don\'t know. Webb seems to be confident that the recent crash of the Russian military jet yesterday was caused by these Stinger missiles, and that it will only get worse.</p>
<p>My question is: how can we get this information to Trump and help prevent his assassination? This has already happened before! JFK fired CIA Director Dulles and then later was allegedly shot by Oswald, who was proven to have associations with the CIA (right?).</p>
<p>How can we get a Twitter hashtag trending (#TrumpBeSafe #TrumpNoFly #TrumpAvoidStingers, etc.)? I am saying this very sincerely, because I find it hard to sleep at night thinking that the President elect could be killed like JFK and then all of the pizzagate people would stay in power.</p>
<p>On the bright side, people like Trump and Steve Pieczenik seem happy and confident. They have much better intellience and insight than we do. On the other hand, Webb seems to really know his stuff, and is basically recreating the entire FBI investigation into the Clinton Foundation on Youtube every day. I don\'t want to overreact, but I want to do my part. Ideas? Advice?</p>',

            Don't forget Trump has top military Generals working with him...men well versed in the arts of war....I'm guessing far beyond any of us.  If they are planning to out PIzzagate....then we won't know a thing about it until the public announcements are made.  Trump's security is some of the best in the world and at this point, they must recognize what they're up against.

             I really want you to be right. The fact that Trump seems happy, calm, and confident is (somewhat) reassuring.
            </p>
            <p>
             The fact that George Webb seems very confident that they will take a shot at Trump is terrifying.

            I've been saying the same thing for a while.  If this "thing" is as huge as I think it is, The Clinton/Podesta orbit has nation/state resources at their disposal.  Especially since world leaders' asses are on the line.  And, it would be a handy excuse to blame it on Russia, kill the Internet, and declare marshal law and nullify the election/inauguration all in one fell swoop.

             Exactly. This is the kind of thing that Webb worries about. The thing that gives me so comfort is that Trump and his people don't seem worried at all.

              Well, when you think about it, they have nothing to lose and everything to lose.  With the complicit MSM, it would be easy to spin the narrative to implicate the Russians.  Just like the forewarning about "fake news" coming soon.  It boggles the mind...

              Anyhow, don't think for a second that these people can't lay hands on a handful of Stingers (or better) SAMs.  Any explosive is at their disposal, as is an array of nasty chemicals and potions.  But the one that worries me the most, is a nuclear weapon or an EMP.  The EMP doesn't worry me as much as it would only be a limited radius device.  To get the full EMP effect, the payload would have to be delivered via ICBM.  This being said, I'm not sure what the endgame would be.  Only that these are very, very dangerous people who will stop at nothing to make #pizzagate go away - from the public's eye.

            I doubt Webb has a specific tip or inside info to support his stinger missile theory.  He does know that the US special forces captured TONS of stinger missiles when Killary ordered the overthrow of Qaddafi.  So Webb surmises that her cabal may well have full control over these weapons and be willing to use them on Trump.  This seems like a possibility to me.  But that would only one on many ways they would consider killing Trump.  A particularly BLATANT one however, so not likely in my view.

            Webb said in a YouTube comment that he is not a pro journalist but rather a citizen journalist whose day job is software sales.

             He also alludes to a confrontation with McCaib at the FBI and previous work leaking USB drives to retired FBI officers. I think has some previous LEO connection, but he has never answered my many questions about this.

            In the days leading up to the inauguration I would imagine Trump and the SS would employ some very covert tactics to travel in hopes that in case something does go wrong, he is not harmed. For instance the trump plane getting shot down but only a pilot being onboard meanwhile he rented a private jet and arrived anyways etc. Assange himself said Trump would not be allowed to become president so this is all coming to a climax soon.

            Anything we know he should know as well. If he gets assassinated (which I am afraid of happening), it will likely happen in a way we don't foresee. My two cents anyway.

            If we just start telegraphing it out over there, asking in our posts for others to create new posts themselves, and pretty soon the whole place will light up.  Someone from that camp has to still be keeping a watch on things.  We'll keep it up until they get it.
           </p>
           <p>
            What I need, in order to do that is something concise.  A long narrative will not be effective.  If anyone is skilled at tight writing, can get the facts that need to be relayed, and will create a new post in here that we'll all see, we can take it from there.

             No, Trump isn't going to Davos - everybody who wants him dead is going to Davos, so they will have an alibi (as if they'd really actually do it themselves). They'll pay Mexican drug lords to shoot him down with stingers and commentators will speculate/suggest/state that it's because they took offence to what he said about Mexicans as reported in MSM or something completely ridiculous and unbelievable like that. But everyone will believe it, because fucknuggets.

              Trump met a few days ago with Carlos Slim, Mexican billionaire who is supposedly a drug lord or at least controls the cartels to some extent (also owns the NY Times which Trump calls out as being dishonest.)  Trump tweeted that Slim asked for the meeting at Mar a Lago and that it went well.  Maybe if Webb's theory is correct Trump told Slim he knows what's on the table (assassination by cartels) and made a deal to avert it.

             Please research before you add and create disinfo. Listen to Webb. He also gave out a dead mans switch about a week ago. Giving his full identity and location in case he goes missing. He also filed. FOIA to the FBI asking them to publish all files relating to him to public prior to starting to tell the story. He has even mentioned they will not be happy with me in Quantico (FBI) HQ's! He did not say Trump would be inDavros. He will be preparing for inauguration. Research who will be in Davros and why? What is there? What meeting? Why would most power in world be in Davros during  inauguration of a new President? Who needs an alibi? Why have no former Presidents RSVP to inauguration? Will they be together in Davros? Why? Research?

            I think Steve Pieczenik is a disinfo agent. He plugs Sandy Hook as a real event and that is one of the laziest false flags I have ever seen.  I was shocked when I heard him insist it was real. I do not trust anything he says now.

             He is sometimes mentioning he attempts to get in (email) contact with FBI or people in the Justice Dep. I am quite sure he will take his responsibility where possible. Also rest assured Trump is fully aware of the dangers facing him. He may have people appointed following information dispersed through social media these days. I have been watching George Webb's videos the last couple days now. His videos are a must and will in a very organized way lay out the fundaments of the entire criminal organization run through the CF. This man may eventually become an important actor in the total break up of this criminal cartel.

             Trump is a Pedophile. Trump/Epstien provided mob casinos for 20+ years with 12 year old girls to fuck.
            </p>

             Trump has Netanyahu so far up his ass that Bibi's cock shows its ugly face in Trump's mouth.
            </p>
            <p>
             Will BIBI ( JEW MAFIA ) kill Trump? R U fucking NUTZ They created Trump.
            </p>
            <p>
             Jew Mafia killed JFK cuz JFK was Irish-MOB, since Giuliani NYC and post JFK the Jew mafia has erradicated Irish &amp; italian mob from NYC, now the USA is 100% Jew-MAFIA, and trump is their Golden FUCK-GOY
            </p>
            <p>
             Jew Mafia killed JFK in 1963 because JFK wanted to ban AIPAC ( then Israel Affairs from USA soil ).
            </p>
            <hr/>
            <p>
             Nobody is going to kill the PEDO Trump
            </p>
            <p>
             JFK demanded a ban on "israel affairs" operating on USA soil, in one month he was dead, and they renamed themselves "AIPAC" after that event.
            </p>
            <p>
             The rest is history. Today AIPAC rule's WASH-DC with Politicians compromised by pedophilia.
            </p>
            <p>
             J Edgar Hoover for 50 years worked with ADL,JDL, and all the other Zionist-Mafia fronts to OWN USA politicians.
            </p>
            <p>
             JFK was Irish mafia, and the Jewish mafia hates competition. Note that Roy Cohn head lawyer at that time for Jewish mob in NYC, is/was the MENTOR for Donald Trump for 20+ years.

             He posts tons of videos of whats "really happening." Hes got pretty good intel and facts presented. Not a bad guy to watch but realize 15%-25% of what he is saying depending on the video is just theorized. Not bad theories but just take that into account. This guy is also well versed in the occult and sacred geometry/numerology so that is where he gets some of his info.

             Highly recommend looking up sacred geometry. Will teach you a lot about the pizzagate occult.
