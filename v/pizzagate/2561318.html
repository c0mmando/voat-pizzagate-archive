You can see an analysis of some disturbing music videos by Katy Perry here, as well as see documentaries detailing child sex abuse in Hollywood, Franklin Nebraska, and Belgium here.

            This world no longer loves nor respects the rights of children.  They care more about having their movies and music and CP and Adult Porn.  Yes, many move from Adult Porn to CP.  It's no longer satisfying enough, they need that Extra Fix.  So Disgusting Beyond Words.

             You're absolutely right! It's crazy how people can go down that path. I talked to a guy once who told me that his buddy slept with tons of women because he was a good looking, rich bachelor living in Newport Beach in CA living a flashy lifestyle. Then one night, they were at dinner and the guy started talking about how he was getting tired of women and alluded to "experimenting" with men. And then proceeded to hit on the guy I was talking to. He was creeped out by it. I told him that it's a spiritual thing, and that demonic spirits are very real, and with enough hedonistic living, you can become a monster due to the fact that humans also have the tendency to be desensitized to things after enough exposure, and that even the most perverse things can become normalized.
            </p>
            <p>
             I have to pray to G-d often just to keep my heart and spirit right and just and uncorrupted with all this exposure to the pedophilic and satanic practices the elites partake in. May God have mercy on us and help us expose these sick and evil creatures...

              Most def people can become desensitized.  Think of all the violence we see and hear about.  I did not grow up with that.  But people are so use to it, it is now normal fare.  What started it all I believe, was the slow creeping violence into movies.  Children now go to the most irreverent movies and also with violence.  It desensitizes them as well.  So now it is much easier for them to bully. Yes, that guy that is into guys now, may step up to the most disgusting abuse ever.  Children.  He has been desensitized. 
The only way to get back to Square 1 is Intervention.  Most people will not even see the road they are on til it is too late.

              Love too, Yes.  But let's hope it never happens.  We have to have more child rapists outed.  I just read a blind on CDAN and people were guessing the name.  One person said, Oh please don't let it be Carol O'Connor.  HELLO.  They have all done something unsavory.  It's the Fee for being Famous.  People!  Give up your Idols.  I feel so much better.

                Yep.  I don't idolize anyone anymore.  Especially actors and politicians and religious leaders.  NONE.  There is one I still listen to, as in music, but do not idolize, I will be prepared if necessary.  I have handled all the others.    Opie, Tom Hanks, Captain Kangaroo, and others.

                 A past fellow researcher friend was friends with Dr. Judith Reisman who wrote Kinsey,Sex, and Fraud exposing his fraudulent "scientific research" on human sexuality. I was searching for info on Captain Kangaroo and came upon this amazing article: 
"Ex-songwriter for 'Captain Kangaroo' testifies against Mapplethorpe photos"
                </p>
                <p>
                 "CINCINNATI -- A former songwriter for "Captain Kangaroo" told jurors in the Robert Mapplethorpe obscenity trial yesterday that the photographer's sexually explicit works should not be displayed in museums because they promote sadomasochism and sexual abuse of children.
                </p>
                <p>
                 Mass media analyst Judith Reisman was permitted to testify in the case against the Contemporary Arts Center and director Dennis Barrie over the objections of defense attorneys, who challenged her ability to evaluate either art or obscenity."
                 <a href="http://articles.baltimoresun.com/1990-10-05/news/1990278079_1_reisman-robert-mapplethorpe-captain-kangaroo">

                </p>
                <p>
                 I had no idea that Judith was a song-writer, much less one for the Captain, before she earned a PHD and became an early Pizzagator, exposing Alfred Kinsey. HOW ODD! She has made an immense contribution through her books on the subject.
                </p>
                <p>
                 The rest of her story and research can be found here:

                 I think I met her once. She is quite passionate about protecting children and exposing these scumbags.

                  Do you remember that there was a case about an old racist politician, I believe in Tenn. that was found to own a few day cares with Bob Keeshan and there was something going on there, it is pretty fuzzy.  It was last year I believe.  I was trying to find the article but cannot in our Search.
