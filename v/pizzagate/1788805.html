             This links the problem to high profile officials. There's a reason the judges didn't find sufficient evidence. The reason is pizzagate - the evidence is either hidden, destroyed, ignored or played away by lawyers. In this case the true evidence was an internal U.N report, leaked. Revealing pizzagate was just fowarded via this post - awareness grew, as one person more knows about it. Or more.
            </p>
            <p>
             Any "normal" judge would have convicted these crimes. But the pizzagate, it prevents, hides, so muchin so many different ways. We can't know if the judges were corrupted, insiders, threatened or even blackmailed. Awareness of this is very important - please spread. U.N. has been alleged on 2000 child abuse cases all over the world. Once, one soldier was convicted for 1 year somewhere in Sri Lanka. People doesn't really know that, as nobody tells them. Pizzagate prevents also healthy journalism in the mass media. Owners of the media are either insiders, corrupted, threatened or even blackmailed. Via that, even journalists who'd like to have no change to report - or they loose their job.
            </p>
            <p>
             I personally hate such journalists, as they shouldn't agree to do so. In a way, they support the problem ongoing. Knowing.
            </p>
            <p>
             Same with ppl who are aware but just keep their mouths shut, for example being afraid that they loose some friends or status. They support the problem ongoing, knowing (but "forgetting"). They care more about themselves.
            </p>
            <p>
             While I wrote this, another 4 childer were being raped. One young princess sold by auction for high price. It's that big. I hope I got one more person into spreading the awareness.

              There was a journalist from Wall Street Journal, Claudia Rosett, did a great job exposing the child raping by the Blue Berets of the UN. She wrote a book exposing the corruption of the peacekeepers from the UN. Of course, nothing was ever done. Another journalist, Betsy McCaughey from New York Post also slammed the UN for their corruption and was glad a Trump was threatening to withdraw and cut funds. Trump knows the crap that is going on.  US gives 22 % to the UN budget. Nobody knows how much that equals. Could be billions. It is another cesspool for corruption. UN President John Ashe died a week before he was set to go to trial for accepting at least $3 million in bribes. He had a barbell fall on his neck while exercising in his gym. You can't make this shit up! Bird was going to sing I expect.
