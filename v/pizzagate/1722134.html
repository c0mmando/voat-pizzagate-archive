IF youwatch the beginning MR PYE states someone put pressure on the Haitian official to release him, this had to have been the STATE Department .. HR Clinton was Secretary of STATE back 2011 .. So, if the STATE dept was releasing a KNOWN pedophile from prison what future potential could this arrest mean for the CABAL in DC?? I think MR PYE is the 1st official domino of many to fall concerning PIZZAGATE and HUMAN TRAFFICKING I Expect a lot more resignations and arrests in the future .. From what I know of the LAW to reopen a 6 yr old case dealing with an American who committed a crime in a foreign country and then have the case reopened 6 yrs later requires THE APPROVAL of the STATE DEPT and Attorney GENERAL (have not been able to verify this) This Daniel PYE arrest is big news for PIZZAGATE and the Pedophile Cabal we\'ve all been hoping to go down SINCE THE BEGINNING OF PIZZAGATE .. SO, this arrest is a big deal and I expect more to come in the near future that are relevant to PEDOGATE DC corruption .. Blackmailed corrupt policy makers and MEDIA HEADS are a big problem for the AMerican people.. I have mined other disturbing evidence that I will release at some point if this PANS out in the near future that will expose THE MSM and INTEL AGENCIES that work hand in hand with them .. Stay tuned..﻿

            Daniel Pye was arrested in Haiti in October 2010, nearly 8 months after Laura Silsby was released.

            I haven't found any connection between Daniel Pye and Laura Silsby at all, except for that video that was pieced together from 3 different TV shows. It is a big deal that Pye was arrested on US soil this month, but I don't see any connection to Laura Silsby at all.

             This guy was just arrested again.  He was with Laura Silsby when she was arrested in Haiti for child trafficking.  He was arrested too then, and they both were let go (at different times) because of pressure from Hillary Clinton.  Their situation is mentioned numerous times in the Podesta Emails.

              Pye says he was arrested in October 2010. Laura Silsby was arrested in February 2010. I haven't seen any evidence that Pye was one of the people with Laura Silsby. 8 of the 10 people who were arrested with Silsby were released brefore her, and only Laura Silsby and her nanny, Charisa Coutler were still in custody on Feb 17, 2010.

              Silsby was mentioned numerous times in Hillary's e-mails, but Daniel Pye was not.

               No, he wasn't. But he says in his interview that "people are helping" to get him out.
              </p>
              <p>
               "It took a combined efforts from lawyers, missionary friends, Haitian senators, the country’s Ministry of Justice and the U.S. Embassy to free him."

               Any attention on him was not good.  But you're right, he wasn't with her specific group.

                OK, but 52 people have upvoated this post with an incorrect headline, and now they probably all believe that Daniel Pye was in Laura Silsby's group which appears to be untrue.

             The difficulty of reopening any case with decent evidence is always the removal of leadership involved in Obstruction of Justice.
Blackmailed Judges are another matter.
