            What if this is all centered around LIVE child porn/ child rape films? (in addition to and or in place of CT) And those pizza parties these elites in the Podesta emails are so obsessed with are CP LIVE filming parties? Not sure about DC, but these do occur among some perverse wealthy, well connected elites in Hollywood where I live. Satanic Cults almost always film their ritual abuse as well. Also a thing in Tinseltown. (they don't call it Hollywood Babylon for nothing.) Sometimes, no, I would say most often, these two are combined in a grisly Eyes Wide Shut kind of production. But you have to be 'in the club' to watch or partake in it. I understand it's also a thing in Germany. Though of course all these parties are very, very underground and from my understanding very expensive to attend. Disgusting depravity that knows no bounds. To stand or sit beside your friends and colleagues whilst watching the torture and abuse of an innocent child. Think about it. Wouldn't they go to great lengths to keep these fetishes secret?

             I have just heard discussion about them since I am an actress but not famous or part of the Elite so not privy to these particular parties. Though I have seen enough with the ones I have been to. Things that can't be unseen.

              But serious, stay safe, if you'v already encountered those "type" things. Dont endanger your life, but do find out anything you can, that's more solid for us. If you attained media-evidence., Im confident you cant get bids from user, public/private news, etc.

            The problem with this thinking is that we are discussing the elite. People known at every level to prefer live performances. And the video's are available online free and for sale. If the elite were discussing viewing videos they would most likely use a code language like 'movie night' &amp; 'pizza' connected. Not just about pizza. And the movies would need to be made. Like any other entertainment that is recorded, being a part of the live audience is where the exclusivity and adrenaline rush is.
This theory is definitely worth exploring as I do believe movies are sold, recommended, passed around, etc. But where the elite are concerned, my bet is they would only put this kind of emphasis on live shows and the real thing.

             i guess you did not understand what i wrote clearly or diden't read it in it's entirety.. I am talking about live shows! Elites could care less about online crap. I just inserted the word LIVE in caps so no confusion.

              The title of your deleted post is 'What if cheese pizza is child porn'. You refer to what if this is child porn multiple times in the post. For future reference, pornography is defined as IMAGES, photographic, film, online, etc. Pornography does not refer to and is specifically defined as that other than in person acts and observations. Child pornography is not live. It is outside the definition of pornography.

                In that case, people are not viewing 'live child pornography'. They are 'witnessing pedophilia'. All it takes is a legal dictionary to explain that one.  You will find the serious researchers here aren't tards, we just care about accuracy. That's ok. You'll learn. Stick with it awhile.
