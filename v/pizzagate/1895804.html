<p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/26/opinion/sunday/it-was-forced-on-me-child-marriage-in-the-us.html?_r=2">https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/26/opinion/sunday/it-was-forced-on-me-child-marriage-in-the-us.html?_r=2</a></p>
<p>The article also details information about child marriages in America generally.  Often, it is the child\'s family that wants the marriage.</p>
<p>It provides a graph of minors who married in 38 states from 2000 to 2010.  The three states with highest numbers were Texas, Florida and Kentucky.</p>
<p>Another graph provides the youngest age allowed to be legally wed for all 50 states.  More than half the states have no minimum age!</p>
<p>Child marriage in the US seems to be a way to avoid statutory rape laws.</p>
<p>From the article:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Globally, a girl marries before the age of 15 every seven seconds, according to estimates by Save the Children. As in Africa and Asia, the reasons for such marriages in the U.S. are often cultural or religious; the American families follow <strong>conservative Christian</strong>, Muslim or Jewish traditions, and judges sometimes feel that they shouldn’t intrude on other cultures.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Also, more interesting information about her background.  In terms of relevance to Pizza/pedogate, she was not the only church member to be victimized by multiple pastors at her church:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Johnson, the former 11-year-old unwitting bride who is now fighting for Florida to set a minimum marriage age (there is none now), says that her family attended a conservative Pentecostal church and that other girls of a similar age periodically also married. Often, she says, this was to hide rapes by church elders.</p>
<p>She says she was raped by both a minister and a parishioner and gave birth to a daughter when she was just 10 (the birth certificate confirms that). A judge approved the marriage to end the rape investigation, she says, telling her, “What we want is for you to get married.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Another black eye for organized religion.</p>
<p>Also interesting in that the NYT enabled comments for the article, for which there are now over 1200 of them.</p>',

            Of course. I was shocked when there was a story damaging to Dems last year, I think it was even one of the early pizzagate stories they did, and there was no way to comment.
           </p>
           <p>
            CNN has done the same thing. Doing away with comments.

            So many in churches are gentle, caring people leading God-fearing lives, though. And Christians overall support social views like the self-evident truth that pedo-exploitation is wrong, while secular humanists advocate on both sides of the issue.

            The New York Times publishes this article on the child marriage, for example, but it also printed glowing reviews of a film called "Diary of a Teenage Girl" (2015), which was about a 15-year-old girl who was sexually exploited by her mother's boyfriend who is 25 years older. Reviewers at the New York Times and other outlets, though, loved that the film didn't actually portray the girl as victimized, but as sexually empowered, and the man as not really that much of a rapist:
           </p>
           <p>
            "What you call Monroe, other than an expletive, depends on what you call a man having sex with a 15-year-old girl. “The Diary of a Teenage Girl” takes place in 1976, when the age of consent in California was 18 (it still is), but it unfolds in an anything-goes milieu in which Monroe might be branded more of an opportunist than a creep..."
           </p>
           <p>
            <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/07/movies/review-in-the-diary-of-a-teenage-girl-a-hormone-bomb-waiting-to-explode.html">

            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            The liberal media here no doubt also want to paint the problem as widespread among all religions because there has been an issue with Islamic refugees coming into Europe with child brides, and some support for keeping the child brides with their "husbands".

            Child sex abuse no doubt expanded when the foster care system became monetized so  I like this idea of monetizing the abuse itself by way of person injury lawsuits where the burden of proof is preponderance  of evidence instead of beyond reasonable doubt as in the criminal process. This only works if there are suffiencient monies to go after. For instance the lawyers representing Jeffrey Epstiens victim had to have made  some sizeable fees off the settlement awards.
           </p>
           <p>
            Judgement collection laws could be changed to enable ongoing garnishment of wages or retirement benefits that would provide an income stream for the victim and lawyer alike and thereby encourage such lawsuits. Personal injury suits could prove a very useful tool in combating sexual exploitation of children. Lawyers really need to put their heads together at nationwide conferences to learn how to handle such cases and to propose legislation at the state level that would facilitate such litigation.

             So, what are all these organizations that collect money from people doing? I am listening to you, but when that does not pan out quick like, I am going to spit some beechnut in that dude's eye and shoot him with my old 45. Some old Coast Guard/Navy/Frog guns actually shoot flare shots with a 10/12 gauge in pistol form. We are here on Voat to stop pedos, not think about them a bit and ponder on. Poor people get raped. Old Story. You could help by giving a list of lawyers that have successfully won cases for child abuse victims with contact #'s.

            Judges must follow the law of the land.  They do not get to follow their own religion, that of their wife or relatives or the bribes of the politicians. I saw on here the other day that Hillary should start now to start looking for the 90 yr. old man that will marry her 8 yr. old grand daughter, Charlotte.  Priceless.

             Even though all mainstream media is controlled, some of what they print or say is true.  Even the BBC puts out stories on pedophilia, despite shamelessly trying to coverup the Jimmy Savile scandal.
            </p>
            <p>
             And many of the comments do seem to be bashing Christians, conservatives and Republicans lol...
            </p>
            <p>
             Which is why I have mentioned in the past why conservative Christians can NOT be the face of this investigation.  It's because the testimonies and statistics in this article will be used to discredit the Pizzagate community, whose major demographic are Evangelicals who voted for Trump.  And the sad thing is that they not wrong for the most part.

              what is considered "true"? if it means honest, then corporate media reporting certainly isn't that. leaving out inconvenient facts in order to create a (mis)perception is disingenuous, to say the least. articles on Savile say that the he escaped detection by exploiting his "position of trust and authority."
             </p>
             <blockquote>
              <p>
               Anne-Marie McAlinden, an expert on sexual abuse at Queen’s University Belfast, said Savile had used his influence to groom not just his victims but also anyone who might take a closer look at the suspicions around him.
She said: "Not only did he abuse his position of trust and authority, which was amplified because he was a celebrity, he extended it to the whole organisation, to the BBC and even the press."
              </p>
             </blockquote>
             <p>
              is this what you'd call "true"?

              As I wrote to someone else, a great many Christians are kind, God-fearing people, and Christians also on the whole support the social view that pedo-exploitation is a crime. That's not the case with secular humanists, who dominate the media. They work on both sides of the issue. The New York Times published this article, but they also help in the effort to normalize pedo-exploitation in other ways. For example, it printed glowing reviews of a 2015 film called "Diary of a Teenage Girl," which was about a 15-year-old girl who was sexually exploited by her mother's boyfriend who is 25 years older. Reviewers at the New York Times and other outlets, though, loved that the film didn't actually portray the girl as victimized, but as "sexually empowered," and the man as not really that much of a rapist:
             </p>
             <p>
              "What you call Monroe, other than an expletive, depends on what you call a man having sex with a 15-year-old girl. “The Diary of a Teenage Girl” takes place in 1976, when the age of consent in California was 18 (it still is), but it unfolds in an anything-goes milieu in which Monroe might be branded more of an opportunist than a creep..."
