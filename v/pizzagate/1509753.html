<h1>CONSPIRACY THEORY</h1>
<hr />
<p>I wanted to write this post for a while, because it is something that bothers me and I see it repeated on here by well-meaning folks who have never given it much thought or understood what it was all about.  I am talking about the term CONSPIRACY THEORIST and the implications and inferences that this term is designed to stir up in the minds of both the receiver, and those who are quick to bandy it about.</p>
<p>In short, it is a politically correct \'thoughtcrime\' label, much in the way Racist / Islamophobe / Xenophobe / Nazi have become. </p>
<p>PizzaGate is a conspiracy theory. FACT. It is both a conspiracy (two or more people plotting do do something underhand / illegal / subversive that they do not wish others to know about), and a theory (in that it has not yet been exposed full let alone proven in a court of law). The Elites have sought to make this neutral term - conspiracy theorist - a negative, and in so doing deter or shame people into never examining the hidden motives of those in powerful positions.</p>
<p>I often see comments here and elsewhere which are \'disclaimers\' by people who have inadvertently bought into the \'conspiracy theory lie\'. By that I mean they preface, or apologise, for something they are about to say like they are embarrassed and/or trying to distance themselves from something they feel will bring them ridicule or will delegitimise what they are about to say</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;I\'m not a conspiracy theorist, BUT...&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I\'m not wearing a tinfoil hat, BUT...&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;We shouldn\'t speculate on XYZ, because people will think we are a conspiracy theorist loon...&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Straight away you are playing into a game, the rules of which have been set in the 60s, by the very power structure who is seeking to delegitimise PizzaGate today.</p>
<p>Below is the start of an article i wrote on my blog and a link to the rest of it. I\'d appreciate your thoughts. But before I start, let me say this. We have to stop playing by their rules. Isn\'t this why Trump won? he refused to play by the lobbyist, powerbroker, mainstream media gatekeeper rules. He went straight to the people, bypassing the age-old power structures and gatekeepers, and essentially hijacked a corrupt party with his populist back-to-Americana message. He spoke from the heart (political correctness be damned), and didn\'t flower or temper his words based on fears of \'PC shaming\'. This was both a strength and a weakness, but it was a calculated and deliberate gamble.  He was attacked for it, but he understood people are fed up with PC-bullying, State ninnying and interference, and the \'appeal to authority\' arguments that academics / media pundits / politicians are the sole arbiters of truth and the custodians of our children\'s futures.  THE PEOPLE HAVE HAD ENOUGH. </p>
<p>And understand too, this is not a partisan statement. I am British - a populist yes - but I a making a factual observation of the dynamics underlying Trumps epic victory in which he overcame - against incredible odds - 14 or so candidates in his own party, sabotage and dirty tricks by the Neocon Globalists who ran the Republican party, he overcame \'gifted nomination votes\' against him, rule changes, endless character assassination, a media campaign which has induced almost a national mental illness epidemic of panic that this 70yr old was \'Literally Hitler\' and despite being in the media eye for decades with never 1% of the accusations levelled against him. He overcame a corrupt media-Establishment combine which sought to use riots, race-baiting, fomenting assassination, dodgy recounts, mass fraud, Soros-run vote machines, and even threatening of Electors to overturn the democratic will of the people. He overcame the entertainment industry and Hollywood trying to psyop the people, billionaires ad oligarchs, heads of multinationals and banks, foreign leaders - every power structure told YOU THE PEOPLE - &quot;Yo cannot vote for this man&quot;.</p>
<p>If there was even a halfway-free Hollywood or Media - people would be recognising this as the most incredible underdog story in politics not just in American history, but the political history of the West. Who has overcome more obstacles, defeated more enemies, in such an insane election year as THIS?!</p>
<p>Even if you are anti-Trump - which is fine by me - you have to recognise that this is what happened. Take a step back and remove partisan or political goggles and analyse what just happened.  If the Left, media and Establishment-types were not consumed by hubris - they could learn from this, adapt and come back. Instead they are doubling-down, and ensuring their own demise all the quicker.</p>
<p>And it ultimately boils down to the people having HAD ENOUGH of being lectured and shoehorned and labelled and belittled... treated as compliant serfs to a New Aristocracy run by a Corporatocratic Globalist New World Order which has subverted the heads of major parties throughout the west into a Uniparty elite which ensures democracy is a sham, for you get the same cabal coming into power regardless of voting.  
</p>
<p>Trump changed all that because many people instinctively understood that, if not on an intellectual level - on a gut level. Your fine country, and incredible Constitution and Bill of Rights which are still to this day the most amazing documents ever written by man - was SO LOSE to being lost forever.</p>
<p>Rant over. Understand that on a psychological level it is about the words, narratives and memes injected into our vocabulary and popular culture which shape out future.</p>

<h1>PIZZAGATE AS A CONSPIRACY THEORY</h1>
<hr />
<p>Just like the term \'conspiracy theory\', you can see this process in action over PizzaGate. They sought to define it in narrow terms - to build a strawman which they could then destroy.  This is Alinsky\'s &quot;<em>Rules For Radicals</em>&quot; Rule 12:</p>
<blockquote>
<ol>
<li>“Pick the target, freeze it, personalize it, and polarize it.” Cut off the support network and isolate the target from sympathy. Go after people and not institutions; people hurt faster than institutions.</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<p>They want to define it as ONE pizza shop, and a \'conspiracy theory\' by online cyber-bullies and sad people with no life, who believe Hillary spiritcooks and rapes little kids in the Comet Ping Pong basement. They sought to CRYSTALISE this definition with a false flag gunman which ticked every box of their strawman. They have then attached blame and personalised it by spreading THOUSANDS of articles blaming InfoWars as the \'originator\' of the conspiracy. Why? so they can claim this crazy conspiracy theory is putting lives at risk and is an example of why we need to \'stop fake news\' (IE, the corporate controlled mainstream media class will be the sole arbiters of not only what is \'true\', but also what you are allowed to talk about. PURE ORWELL).</p>
<p>This way they can create precedents for censorship (if they can take down InfoWars, nobody is safe). They want to crystallise what PizzaGate is in the minds of the uninformed masses, and therefore make it toxic so that people will refuse to listen or investigate further. It is an exercise in the &quot;Conspiracy Theory Thoughtcrime Label&quot;</p>
<p>Back to Conspiracy Theory.  Embrace the term and define it properly.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>PizzaGate is an international citizen investigation, nonpartisan in nature, which seeks to expose Elite paedophile and child trafficking rings, and the power structures and media class which seek to protect the perpetrators. We are doing this because the State and Media is compromised and we want to force them - through exposing criminality or shaming them through public pressure - into doing their jobs &quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To defeat the enemy we must understand the enemy, that means reading Orwell\'s &quot;<em>1984</em>&quot; (a blueprint not a fiction), Alinsky\'s &quot;<em>Rules for Radicals<em>&quot;, and even Edward Bernay\'s 1928 classic &quot;</em>Propaganda</em>&quot; - a quote from which i will leave you with</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“The conscious and intelligent manipulation of the organized habits and opinions of the masses is an important element in democratic society. Those who manipulate this unseen mechanism of society constitute an invisible government which is the true ruling power of our country.</p>
<p>...We are governed, our minds are molded, our tastes formed, our ideas suggested, largely by men we have never heard of. This is a logical result of the way in which our democratic society is organized. Vast numbers of human beings must cooperate in this manner if they are to live together as a smoothly functioning society. </p>
<p>...In almost every act of our daily lives, whether in the sphere of politics or business, in our social conduct or our ethical thinking, we are dominated by the relatively small number of persons...who understand the mental processes and social patterns of the masses. It is they who pull the wires which control the public mind.”</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<h1>CONSPIRACY THEORIST: JUST ANOTHER PC THOUGHTCRIME LABEL</h1>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>Not all situations labelled ‘conspiracy theories’ are wild fantasies. Sometimes they are actually ‘conspiracies’ and turn out to be fact.</p>
<p>Not all people who express a shocking opinion you disagree with, are ‘loons’, or members of the ‘tin-foil hat brigade’. Sometimes they are simply better informed and/or more open-minded than the person using flippant label to disparage them.</p>
<p>This is a comment meant for all, but especially the people who are quick to play the ‘conspiracy theorist loon’ card. In fact – if someone accuses you of this – send them this link.  Who knows – it may make them reconsider their position (unlikely), or at the very least, they may self-censor when they feel compelled to blurt out this accusation on impulse.</p>
<p>First of all – let’s examine the definition: <a href="https://redgreenalliance.com/2016/03/30/conspiracy-theorist-just-another-pc-thoughtcrime-label/">CONTINUES HERE</a></p>

            Nice post, and your use of
            <em>
             Rules for Radicals
            </em>
            Rule 12 is exactly what we need to think of when we conduct investigations such as this. I've literally just posted about Barrett Brown and I've posted before about how we must remain an anonymous collective force if we are to succeed in this most difficult of tasks.

            the real dichotomy facing us is between authoritarian and libertarian, and you get those extremes in all political groups

            A conspiracy is merely an agreement between people to do something illegal.  People are convicted of conspiracy all the time.
           </p>
           <p>
            For example, watching the entire mainstream media obscure the PG evidence with mosaics and cropping, or ignore it completely, is what I would call a massive conspiracy to obstruct justice.

            I am hopeful a lot of the rhetoric some feel as divisive was a device, and that once in, he will aim to bring greater unity. It is what he has been saying - that it is time to come together - but we will only really know once in several months. But its up to us as individuals as much (if not more so) than those in power.

            The great awakening. Hopefully all sides of the political divide will wake up to the fact they have been deliberately tribalised ("you red tribe, me blue tribe") - in order for the power Elites to play a grand game of Divide and Conquer.
