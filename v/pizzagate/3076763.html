           <p>
            AlertSense was behind that!?
           </p>
           <p>
            The Wikipedia page cites an unnamed, unlinked Hawaii Star Advertizer article as the source of that information. Could not find one mentioning the name of either company during that date rage using their search engine but
            <a href="https://www.staradvertiser.com/search/missile/?advance=true&amp;before=2018-03-31&amp;after=2017-12-22&amp;s=missile&amp;">
             here are all the results mentioning "missile"
            </a>
            . Maybe someone else has time to dig through them.
           </p>
           <p>
            I did find
            <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/alertsense-announces-company-name-change-to-konexus-300621246.html">
             a sanitized PR Newswire mention

            of the name change.

             This notice

           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             Rapoza was adamant that a simple human mistake caused the false alert. And it looked not just possible but easy to make the mistake in the screenshot the agency released, with the link for “Test Missile Alert” close to, and nearly indistinguishable from, the link for “Missile Alert.”
            </p>
            <p>
             The Hawaiian agency later modified its story, probably in response to complaints from the software manufacturer—which the Hawaiian television station KHON2 has identified as an Idaho company named AlertSense. The Emergency Management Agency replaced its first screenshot with a second, showing a Windows-style drop-down menu instead of a 1990s-era set of hotlinks. And, the agency confessed, the employee also had to make a second bad choice, clicking “Yes” on a confirmation pop-up. While not admitting to be the manufacturer, AlertSense has given demonstrations of its software to KHON2 and The Verge in recent days, by way of suggesting that the Hawaiian employee had, in fact, to go through multiple menus and clicks to send out the false alert, beginning with choosing what the company called a “wrong template option.”

            <p>
             The information referenced has been removed twice, more than one year before the most current time(for a total of 3). Now, I hate gatekeeping on wiki too (
             <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/v/pizzagate/3072826/17140367/1/">
              as I have recently expressed
             </a>
             ), but the reasons given for the removals here, relate to sourcing issues (lack of adequate sources) and are not indicative of (a): regular efforts to censor OR (b): that AlertSense is directly responsible.
             <strong>
              That said, perhaps a "citation needed" edit would be more appropriate and less inflammatory.
             </strong>
            </p>
            <p>
             However, the person who most recently re-added the info along with the claim that AlertSense is behind the removals, offers
             <em>
              nothing
             </em>
             to support that claim. Also, while they have included 'sources' this time, said sources don't actually link to corroborating information. They're basically just telling you to go google shit.
            </p>
            <p>
             While the information may be true and sources may exist, the person(s) adding it to the wiki is/are clearly unwilling to source the claims properly - resulting in the removals.
            </p>
            <p>
             Now, I've tried as best I can to verify the claims that Laura Gayner is Laura Silsby - there's enough out there to present the case that this is likely to be true,
             <strong>
              so why
             </strong>
             <strong>
              <em>
               repeatedly
              </em>
             </strong>
             <strong>
              botch adding the info to wiki?

             I'm not in the slightest bit happy about the deletion reason, but with the above in mind, something stinks about the botched MYSTATEUS, Inc./AlertSense edits and the subsequent accusation being made about the removals.
            </p>
            <p>
             Again, I've pretty much been able to verify that Silsby = Gayler = was/is involved with MYSTATEUSA, Inc. and AlertSense, but what exactly is so hard about coherently adding the information to the wiki entry, with sufficient sourcing(which does appear to exist)?
            </p>
            <hr/>
            <p>
             In summary, while it does appear that the claims being made (other than the claim that AlertSense is behind the "regular" deletion of the information) are mostly verifiable, I suspect that
             <em>
              a certain someone
             </em>
             is deliberately* causing a commotion which will inevitably have a negative blowback on pizzagate researchers.
            </p>
            <p>
             *Alternatively, if my suspicions are correct, the person making these edits may be a bit... uh... how do I put this politely... perhaps they're not thinking enough about what they're doing... they may have good intentions, but are otherwise defeating their own cause.

           <p>
            Here’s how Hawaii’s emergency alert design led to a false alarm
           </p>
           <p>
            Officials soon released a timeline of events, saying the state’s software contained a menu option that allowed a live alert to be sent in place of a test, a problem that several people quickly categorized as a design failure. The state released an image that showed a list with options for test and live alerts next to each other. Officials later said the image did not accurately portray the system, and released what it characterized as a “representation” of the system, but said that it could not share an actual screenshot.
           </p>
           <p>
            While the state has not named its software provider, evidence suggests it is an Idaho-based company called AlertSense, a FEMA-approved company that says it works with clients in states around the country. The audio version of the alert broadcast in Hawaii was posted on the company’s website. The first image released by Hawaii also appears similar to example software provided to The Verge by AlertSense. For instance, the word “templates” appears above the alert options in AlertSense’s software, and is barely visible in the first image issued by the state. (A local TV station in Hawaii independently came to the same conclusion.) The Verge’s review of the program suggests that functionally there is only a one-click difference between sending a test and a live alert.
           </p>
           <p>
            AlertSense would not confirm whether it was the vendor of the software, but in an interview with The Verge, it provided a presentation that outlines how its system works. (The Hawaii Emergency Management Agency declined to comment.)
           </p>
           <p>
            AlertSense CTO Randy Grohs explained that there are essentially two paths to send an alert using the system. In one, an alert is created from scratch. The user of the software fills in information for the alert, like where it’s being sent, what the message says, and crucially, whether it’s a test or live alert.
           </p>
           <p>
            AlertSense describes the system as an eight-step process. If you select a template, some of those steps include scrolling through and checking auto-filled information, but even so, the company says, it requires more than one click to send an alert. In Idaho, the company points out, a news segment ran this week about AlertSense having safeguards to prevent what happened in Hawaii.
           </p>
           <p>
            News Segment
            <a href="https://www.ktvb.com/article/news/local/how-idahos-emergency-alert-system-works/277-508611180">
             https://www.ktvb.com/article/news/local/how-idahos-emergency-alert-system-works/277-508611180
            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            But effectively, when using a template, there are three clicks, whether a live message or test is sent. If the information in those templates isn’t double-checked, the versions would look essentially the same. The main difference is whether the user clicks the test template option or the real one. The company says it may now alter the final pop-up confirmation to be different for test and live alerts.
           </p>
           <p>
            “If you don’t follow best practices, the difference between sending live and a demo can be configured to be a small difference,” Grohs says.
           </p>

            This system is Totally Irresponsible.  I am not swift when it comes to getting this stuff, but even I know that.
