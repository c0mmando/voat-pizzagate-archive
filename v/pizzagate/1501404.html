<p>Look at donald trump he ASS-FUCKED little girls for years looking for whore to feed his casinos, he didn\'t want to damage the goods vaginally as people pay big money for intact HYMEN,</p>

<p>There are no good people, everyone has the potential to be a monster.</p>
<p>Society created religion to solve this problem where the sheep could believe in GOD and follow the good book ( yet note the entire bible is about rape, torture, and mutilation )</p>
<p>We all want change, but is like the &quot;Batman Movie&quot;, &quot;I told you I would take you places, ... I never said they were good places&quot; </p>

<p>GOOD? for whom?</p>
<p>IMHO largely pizzagate was created to selectively take out opposition to the TRUMP MAFIA, so they could have a free rein in redesigning the USA,</p>
<p>Note this is what they did in NYC, GIULIANI took out the Italian mafia, and now NYC is 100% Talmud mafia, TRUMP intends to do that for all of the USA and maybe the world</p>

            You judge people by what they did in the past. Since 1960's everyone of Trump's mentors was the KOHN Mafia ( RUSSIAN MOB Brought to USA in 1960's ), after they killed JFK, they brought in a ton of people to re-design the power in NYC. JFK had deals with Irish/Italian mob going back to Joe Kennedy running whores and whiskey.
           </p>
           <p>
            Trump's Mentors all ran whore houses and casinos, Trump's mentors all served time in prison for murder.
           </p>
           <hr/>
           <p>
            A person is know by the company he keeps, people don't change, anybody saying "GIVE TRUMP A CHANCE" is a fool.
           </p>
           <p>
            A Good Person can't defend TRUMP his history is just too fucking god damn evil, the man has spent his entire life living with the DEVIL.

            We know exactly what TRUMP is going to do. Look at his cabinet selection GOLDMAN-SACKS 100% the people who raped the world and caused 2008 collapse, now even have more power.
           </p>
           <p>
            Even OBAMA didn't have the balls to give GS all the keys to the PEDO  HOUSE.
           </p>
           <p>
            Trump is a FASCIST cops love his ass, PRIVATE prison stocks are sky-rocketing.
           </p>
           <p>
            TRUMP will Prove to be the TURNING point where USA citizens were rounded up and sent to CAMP FEMA to be fucked to death.

            Dude, I know its bleak.
But put it this way
           </p>
           <p>
            By all accounts this shit has been going on for centuries, with little interruption.
           </p>
           <p>
            But something has changed. Julian Assange and the tools he and we use.
           </p>
           <p>
            I will eat my hat if somewhere some ancient dynastic families aren't having screaming matches in their parlour rooms saying 'I told you not to give internet to the plebs!'
           </p>
           <p>
            But as for your trump allegations - you gotta put up or shut up. Yes he has some shady associations, but you own a billion dollar empire and all sorts of pricks own shares in your enterprises. You cant account for their characters.
Yes he was close to Epstein for a while. Maybe he saw the path Epstein took and was so reviled it gave him the impetus to one day become President and flush these demons out. Maybe that's why he seemed to be a democrat for years then switched ticket - he might have presumed that the paedo mafia was initially stronger in the republicans, until the Clinton Foundation gave him cause to make jokes at high society dinners about Hillary taking a few villages of children from Haiti.
           </p>
           <p>
            That doesnt sound to me like a guy engaged in a cover up. Hell, maybe in his time he fucked a few 16 year old girls and thought that was ok. Back in the 60s and 70s it pretty much was, provided you werent too much older yourself. But maybe he has a line, and Epstein crossed it
