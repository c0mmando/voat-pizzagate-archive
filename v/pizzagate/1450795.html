<p>He was arrested for abducting and raping 5 kids, but was sentenced to just 13 years and served only 3. He got out and kidnapped two more kids. He was arrested a second time for stealing cars and while police were searching his home, he had the two girls chained in his basement.</p>
<p>A locksmith who was present during the search told the officers that he heard children\'s voices coming from somewhere in the house, but was told to ignore it. The two girls died of starvation while Dutroux was in custody.</p>
<p>Two months after his release he kidnapped another young girl and then 3 months later he kidnapped another. He was arrested several days later on suspicion of the kidnappings and confessed to police. He led them to the girls, who were still alive and chained in his basement. He also led them to two of his other houses where he had buried previous victims.</p>
<p>He told investigators he was part of a national pedophile ring that included high-ranking members of police force and government. 11 previous victims came forward and some told how they were used by Dutroux as underage prostitutes for elite business men and politicians at sex parties.</p>
<p>The Judge in charge of the investigation, who was actually going to put these people on trial, was dismissed from the case because he had attended a fund-raising dinner for one of the victims\' parents and the investigation was ended on grounds of conflict of interest. The judge himself believed the Mafia had taken over the case.</p>
<p>Twenty people connected with the Dutroux case died under suspicious circumstances. </p>
<p>Thousands of Belgians were outraged by what they believed was a cover-up, and 300,000 people marched in Brussels with demands for reforms of the  Police and Justice system. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_March">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_March</a></p>

            Yep i've known about the story for years. Tried to tell people about it many times but of course was looked at as crazy. It is another very important case to make sure the public is aware of. It's a great feeling re-educating the dumbed down masses and finally witnessing many waking up and getting mad!

            Can you confirm what you are referring to exactly when you say "NSFW"? If the page you link contains any child porn, even as an exhibit of a legal case, following the link would still be an offence in many jurisdictions.

            We are the light. It's up to us to dig all that crap out and try to make as many people as possible take the red pill. Once the movement reaches a critical mass and starts being able to create real damage in the elite circle, people who are not guilty of pedophilia but covering up because they fear for their career or life will start speaking out. I'm sure a large majority of people currently involved in covering up have deep moral qualms and wish they could speak out. I'm sure some will find the courage to speak out when they see that the tide is turning.

            Looked at his blog and he seems to have a pro-democrat / anti-republican political bias that is getting in the way of his being objective about #pizzagate. Look at his latest blog about #pizzagate, it's all about Trump's interest in teenagers and why Trump supporters are wrong ... Fine, but the election is over, no-one is researching pizzagate to get a political angle. That has absolutely nothing to do with pizzagate. Why rope Trump in in spite of the fact he is neither a democrat nor a DC resident and couldn't possibly be involved in pizzagate? Why bring politics at all in the story? If you are a decent human being, politics shouldn't be relevant when it comes to innocent children being raped and murdered. Pizzagate is one thing. Trump's misdoings another. Both can be investigated separately. I really don't see how whatever Trump is doing affects at all the legitimacy of the #pizzagate effort.

             Aangirfan, aka Aanirfan, Is a Fraudster
Aangirfan makes a big thing about exposing paedophiles. Here, in a recent post, are a couple of pictures with Aangirfan's original caption, or absence of caption:
             <a href="https://canspeccy.blogspot.com/2016/02/aangirfan-aka-aanirfan-is-fraudster.html">
              http://canspeccy.blogspot.com/2016/02/aangirfan-aka-aanirfan-is-fraudster.html
             </a>
             You don't have to be a Trump supporter to despise this kind of garbage.
            </p>
            <p>
             Whether Aangirfan was always a lying scumbag is not quite clear. A few months ago, Aangirfan changed his domain from aangirfan.blogspot.com to aanirfan.blogspot.com. The change corresponded with a switch from mostly rather short posts, which however far-fetched, seemed to have some basis in fact and reason, to tediously long and incoherent posts that seem to serve no purpose except to smear someone or to spin fantastic and ridiculous conspiracy theories about almost everything, with the object, perhaps, of inculcating the idea that all conspiracy theories must be nonsense.
            </p>
            <p>
             The case of Aangirfan, alias Aanirfan, provides a useful warning that the Internet is a source not of information, but of images and verbiage, which may or may not convey real information, and which have been placed at your disposal for reasons you know nothing about, but which may be intended greatly to your detriment.

              Too much information kills information. Saying everything and its contrary equivs to saying nothing. That's why counter-intelligence is actively creating noise around facts to cancel the facts. Reputation is the only way to discriminate information from noise. Something stated by someone without a reputation that isn't backed by a proof or doesn't stand on its own merit is essentially worthless and should be ignored.

             I read his site as well, I also came to the same conclusion as well. very biased. people have to LOOK for signs of people putting red herrings out. It is not always easy to spot it takes a very critical eye.

            Do you have some reliable sources (in French or English) that exposes the cover up? The
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_March">
             wikipedia page
            </a>
            strangely doesn't make any allusion to a deliberate cover up by the police and mainstream media. The more I dig, the more it seems that the entire global elite is guilty of pedophilia. This is really crazy.

            Wow! Good find. My guess, know what I have read about #PizzaGate, I have no doubt this is part of it. They don't allow witnesses. I'd give you an up vote) but apparently I have reached my limit for the day. I just joined voat, so not sure how it all works, but seems pretty crazy to not be able to up vote all the #PizzaGate finds.

            I'm thinking the poster meant..Dutroux was the "fall guy" in the sense that he got all the blame on him while many many others he was involved with, perhaps richer? never saw a day in prison.

            Dutroux and Franklin should be mandatory reading before delving into the newer stuff.   Michael Nihoul, Marc Dutroux's handler said this:  "I control the government. … Everyone has compromising dossiers on one another, to be used as leverage in the right situation. … This is the Belgian disease. …"  The tiny country of Belgium seems particularly infested with these monsters, the government, businesspeoples and ancient families all involved.  And you know what else is in Belgium...NATO of course.

              I'm telling you guys these cops are disgusting pedophiles and killers themselves. Trust nothing that comes out of their mouths.

            I assume he meant that it was sad because nabbing him was only the tip of the iceberg, and it didn't bring the entire ring down.

            You misunderstood me. He is one of the nastiest pedos for sure, but other more powerful evil pedos are still outside running. For example, Michel Nihoul.

            I was sceptic about PizzaGate initially, as a lot of people would be, I guess. After reading and watching into the Dutroux case, the very suspicious suicides and car crashes, I knew something was really wrong there. From there on I started to take PizzaGate more serious. I do not dare to say it's is 100% the truth at the moment, that there would be absolutely no other possibilities, but if this all it turns out completely something else, I would be equally confused as when I had discovered PizzaGate.

            Sad thing is he clearly was thrown under the bus in order to protect the whole ring. I read some of the articles suggesting that he was just a small cog.
