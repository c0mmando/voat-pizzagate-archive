             Alex Jones is a CIA shill. Pizzagate, well that of Besta-Pizza is largely about 'Arab Needs', having the arabs come forward is a very important part of the coming narrative.
            </p>
            <p>
             Who better than a fucking lawyer? Arab lawyer to boot. Probably the same lawyer that represents the Saudi's that own the entire block.
            </p>
            <p>
             What about Bigg's? He blew the whistle on the SNUFF-APP where besta-pizza was selling video-time where people in real-time could watch children murdered. Alex Jones doesn't want this discussed. Biggs is gone.
            </p>
            <p>
             Best customer for watching white baby's murdered is Saudi Arabia/Dubai, they love that shit.
            </p>
            <p>
             I predict you will see Arab's by the 100's come on Alex Jones TV and portray themselves as victims of pizzagate.
            </p>
            <p>
             ....
            </p>
            <p>
             Pizzagate announces that Arab's (SAUDI/DUBAI) owns the PEDO-BLOCK, Owners send a ARAB-LAWYER to investigate, with his family, during the meal, a mad gun-man ( alex jones fan ) shoots the place up, and the same arab lawyer later appears on Alex Jones show.
Insane? Yep

              That was a fake document debunked a few days before reddit pizzagate got shut down. Total misinformation. It was originally purported to have come off wethepizza's website. It's a long and drawn out 2 day process of how that file came about, from a larper/troll, and it was immediately debunked.

               show up in 1 nanosecond to protect Andrew-Kline(DOJ) or defend this story about the Snuff-APP is highly suspicious.
              </p>
              <p>
               Bigg's covered this story, you think as a SOLDIER who knows about SNUFF-FILMS you think he didn't verify this story?

                I watched it unfold in real time when it first came out. It was 2 guys that had the most popular thread on
                <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/pizzagate">
                 /r/pizzagate
                </a>
                for 2 days. They started cracking when being pressured by the community for real evidence, kept postponing proof, talked about sharing 2gb of encrypted files that they supposedly stole from inside some pizza shop (wethepizza) they claimed was being used for child trafficking. Constantly changed their story and backtracked, avoiding answering any real questions. Then they said the cloned the pizza shops hard drive and were going to share the torrent of the encrypted hard drive. Over the course of two days they led the community on a wild goose chase, then apparently posted real CP (which was moronic). I'm not saying you have to believe it's fake, but everyone, including the the most prominent investigators/researchers came to the logical conclusion that they were either shills trying to get the subreddit shut down, or larpers just leading everyone on. Here is a file from the pizzagate archives, read the threads and come to your own conclusions. But I watched it all unfold over two days, and personally believe it was fake as well.
               </p>

               <p>
                That is a link to all the threads from the reddit archive involving the story with that menu. Do the research yourself. Biggs wasn't there apparently when it was first released over almost a month before he picked up on it, and with a totally different story of how it was obtained. It's literally over the top obsurd.
               </p>
               <p>
                I don't know why/how Biggs was duped, and I'm not questioning his intelligence, I'm just saying I believe he's wrong. Read the threads yourself.
