Enjoy:</p>
<p>&quot;Pizzagate is the tip of a very fucked up iceberg. You don\'t have to believe in any of this occult stuff, but understand that the world is ruled by people who believe and practice it. Plan accordingly. Prepare for war.</p>
<p>Check this out. There is a rare eye defect caused coloboma which occurs in less than 1/10,000th of the general population, but is much more common among the pizzagate population (both perps and victims). The gene which sometimes causes coloboma is associated with mental disorders, increased intelligence, delayed puberty, and an enlarged pituitary gland. The pituitary gland is a vestigial Reptilian 3rd eye, &quot;the seat of the soul&quot;, a source of DMT, a target of mass poisoning via fluoride, and a tasty treat for satanists. Remember that scene from Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas? It wasn\'t a joke.</p>
<p>Here are some people who supposedly have coloboma. I haven\'t checked out most of them: Madeleine McCann George Soros Jeb Bush Bush Sr. Andrew Sorkin, one of Clinton\'s flying monkeys at the NYT Jacob Rothschild Dianne Feinstein Henry Kissinger(?) Aldous Huxley Lucian Greaves, spokesman of the satanic temple (?) A bunch of kids on Alefantis\'s instagram account <a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1458452">https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1458452</a> Alefantis\'s test-tube godson The kid in the heavy breathing video (abused by Podesta?) The shellshocked kid in the Podesta card game photo. Possibly Madeleine herself. The muslim antichrist is supposed to have a deformed eye. I always seems to be the right eye. Probably an occult reason for this. The left eye represents the eye of lucifer.</p>
<p>Here are some theories relating to coloboma. An occult fetish, a taste for pineals, a sign of easy MKultra programming, some kind of Mark of the Puppetmaster, the puppetmasters sowing their wild oats in sperm banks to spread sociopathy throughout the West, or the puppetmasters sowing their wild oats so they can harvest compatible blood and organs later (McCann was a test tube baby, and devouring ones\' own children is a known satanic thing, passed down from the myth of Saturn).</p>

<p>Don\'t expect it to make sense at first. We\'re more clueless than Papuan villagers during WWII. Our brains do not physically have the connections needed to understand the whole truth. Trying to understand the entire &quot;Cthulhu Mythos&quot; is an impossible task and a ticket to a padded cell, or worse.</p>
<p>Suffice to say that the persistence, manipulation, and sheer evil required to guide history to this point would be beyond anything normal humans are capable of. They have off-world help. Telepathic, genetic, or both. They would say both. The real puppetmasters use our local puppetmasters as gloves in a glove box. Our entire civilization is the devil\'s farm.</p>
<p>The Good News is that we also have friends in high places, if we just stop listening to all the messages telling us not to listen.&quot;</p>',
