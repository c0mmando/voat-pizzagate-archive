            Because to be completely free of them and have your account deleted and email deleted you need to phone them.  Talk to a supervisor and have them remove all of your information, otherwise they keep you on file.  I wanted my apple ID account gone forever and this is what I had to do.  I was on the phone for at least 3/4 hour with apple in which they asked me question after question.  I ended up hanging up on amazon after screaming at them.  They would not do what I wanted.  It's all in the terms and conditions that you agree to when getting and apple ID or amazon account and I'm sure it's the same with other accounts in which you have to agree to certain terms and conditions.

            Get rid of Facebook and Twitter etc.  Cancel your cable subscription.  Anything can easily be pirated online.  DVD movie screenings always get leaked.  I prefer watching movies at home anyways.  Also install ad-block.
           </p>
           <p>
            All those are very simple.

            , you know this is an unsourced discussion post that belongs in
            <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/v/pizzagatewhatever">
             v/pizzagatewhatever
            </a>
            , and I have to remove it per Rule 4. Please repost it there. What I don't get is why you just give the finger to the submission guidelines? You've been here a lot and contributed a lot. You are not a shill. But instead of showing the new folks how to make a post we can leave up, you make one we have to take down, which will feed the "mods are compromised" shill narrative that wants to create dischord and distrust. Why? Why waste everyone's time?
           </p>
           <p>
            You could have thrown in a couple of links to articles about how to conduct successful boycotts. You could of linked to WHO to boycott. You could have linked to recent successful boycotts (Target comes to mind). Instead, this.

            You assume I can afford to be on grid in the first place.  Secondly you assume I won't rob you.  Then third you think bc you have kids I care...I care less in that situation.

            Been trying to get that message out myself --
Stop cooperating with capitalism which is an evil which cannot be regulated.
           </p>
           <p>
            Notice that it begins with our Founders (Masters of Deceit) having created an Elite patriarchy
which has always been underpinned by organized patriarchal religion.
            <br/>
            Stop supporting male-supremacist religion which has for two thousand years has been at war with
Jews, Women, Children, Homosexuals and Nature.
           </p>
           <p>
            "Manifest Destiny" and "Man's Dominion Over Nature" are the licenses to exploit nature, animal-life
and even other human beings according to various myths of inferiority.
           </p>
           <p>
            One of the major harms done to our planet comes from animal-eating and you can do your own body
and the planet a great deal of good by stopping that chain of violence.
           </p>
           <p>
            Keep pushing to end the Drug War, legalize marijuana, grow hemp which actually helps the planet
and the ozone layer.
           </p>
           <p>
            And anytime you are all ready for an issue large enough, let's all at one time pull the plug on cable TV.
           </p>
           <p>
            Most of all, remember whatever we do it must remain non-violent because violence will only benefit these
already very violent people.  In fact, the only way they've been able to rise is via violence of assassination,
coups, intimidation, threats, torture.  That's always been true and it is still true today.
           </p>
           <p>
            Thank you!
           </p>
           <p>
            And most of all, keep on tellin' it -- :)
           </p>
           <p>
            PS:  Move your money to credit unions -- an idea that began a few years ago.

            Yes yes and more yes. I advice everyone to become as self sufficient as possible as this is what really hurts them, grow your own foods get some solar panels and learn to build things. Build and grow as much as you can and avoid corporate anything, you're life, and health, psychical and mental will also improve.

            I think in order to do this successfully we will have to find some alternatives. I don't foresee anyone "doing without" these days.
           </p>
           <p>
            Do we have any reputable substitutions for those not willing to go cold turkey? In the past year I've gotten down to only one credit union account (no fb, cell phone, or tv) and it's actually harder then one might think.

            I say boycott ALL of the Globalist companies. Tell em you're boycotting because you oppose globalism, monopolies and GREED. Stossel says greed is good, but he's confused. Profit is good, not greed. Greed is trying to get more than you need in prudent reserves, including by cheating others.

            Yes, yes and yes.  Finally, there is this post.  This is what can make a huge, huge difference.
When I found out about all of this way back when, that is exactly what I did.  I will have nothing to do with any large corporation.  It makes life slightly less convenient but that is all.  It can be done and life is much better knowing you are not supporting the wealthy nonsense.

            Been doing this for years. Only reason I have Amazon Prime is for The Grand Tour and even then I'm disgusted with Jeff Bezos to the point I'd rather torrent them and cancel my subscription. Depending on the effects of the NDAA I may be cutting my social interaction online to very specific places to divulge the truth and for limited self interest because of small business. I buy my 4 dollar shirts in bulk. I've been over most forms of materialism for a long time. I'm checked out besides using the internet to disseminate what I can of the truth.  #AutisticAsFuck

            It's a cool idea, but, people have been cutting ties and rescinding from the mainstream for decades now. Sadly... the sheeple are not how "they" are making their money. Massively leveraged investments, banking/tax loopholes, proxy wars, infrastructure development in recently shifted foreign governments, organ/human trafficking...
           </p>
           <p>
            Any "public" money - movies, entertainment, media, groceries, consumer goods, etc... while those individual markets can be impacted by boycotts - none of this really impacts how "they" earn a living. Hedge funds, offshore accounts, huge percentage gains, limited paper trails... look at the Panama Papers leak. Even that was successfully silenced for the most part due to the involvement of the powers that be. And that leak was successfully executed without exposing those who were in charge/standing to gain the most.
           </p>
           <p>
            Our only available currency is information. Without it, without hard-hitting evidence, we have nothing and can impact very little.
           </p>
           <p>
            If the sources of leaks/evidence have all been compromised and gagged - we are quite simply screwed.
           </p>
           <p>

             Yes I have been 'cutting and rescinding' (not as much as I should - get better every week though.)

             We need to try to figure out how to unbrainwash the police and military. If you could make friends with them red pilling might be easier for both parties.
            </p>
            <p>
             I like the videos of people watching/filming cops do their job and when the cops get suspicious they throw out red pills (ie 'I'm filming you steal a car on behalf of a stranger because they didn't pay a stranger to travel from A-B').

            etsy is also a good place for handmade items in America.  There is a filter you can use to only see American sellers.  I can tell some are reselling chinese crap but most are honest.  lots of stuff like clothes, sock, gifts for kids.  Time we put the money back into the American people.

            Yea, divide delay conquer strategy is in effect.
Everyday is a breaking story that doesn't break, it's been almost half a year song PG broke. How many children murdered to molech in that time?

            Boycott divest.
Max Keiser had a great idea about boycotting coke a cola products. It's such a big company and involved internationally yet margins in food are low. So a few percentage of people boycotting products really does damage. It's already happening with Starbucks over that immigration issue.

            Buy local, support local shows plays artists musicians, credit unions. Starve the beast. Sadly the very act of existing in this country feeds and supports these pedos.

            Same with alternative news and listening to youtubers shout "this is a call for an uprising" every day is going to get you nowhere as a lot of these youtubers and alt news are there to "keep you in a loop" of doing nothing.  We have to avoid getting caught in a loop of nothing happening when we are the ones to make the change happen.

            Guess What?  We are already banking in a credit union, We cut the cord 2 yrs. ago and the only movie we saw last year was Snowden. We try to shop at small shops except for our groceries.  Even those we buy produce at farmer's markets etc.  This is the way folks.  I hate big box stores anyway.  Also if you really want to hurt the really big investors and TPTB divest from  the pipeline being done by Enbridge.  All of the Congress people are invested in it.  If your friends and family hate fracking, tell them to do it too, that way you will be able to get people to boycott for our cause with out telling them it is for pizzagate.  This will save you the backlash from those that do not believe.  This is a great idea and will hurt them in the pocketbook.  That is what they really care about.

            I totally agree about shutting down the MSM completely.
           </p>
           <p>
            Even regardless of Pizagate, the MSM is pure propaganda and slanted 90% towards one side (Neo-Liberal/globalist).
           </p>
           <p>
            That alone will likely spark a kinetic, civil war in this county.

           <p>
            Everything that they cover is what the political elites, CIA, or their globalist owners want them to cover.

             Don't ever watch commercials -- as soon as they come on make sure you switch to another channel
and/or mute the TV.  Disconnect from MSM "news" which will increase the frustration that builds cause
they know they've lost huge numbers of viewers already who no longer are absorbing their propaganda.

              I even do this in YouTube. If an ad starts to play, I refresh until I get just the video. If they won't me, then I don't watch the video.

               Right -- and that was little commented on as commercials/ads moved onto these videos.
I presume that it is YouTube that does it -- though possibly some ads may support individual investigators?
Though I don't think so cause there is also a side campaign against YouTube/google complaining that ads by
Pepsi and Starbucks -- can't remember another company -- coupled with "extreme videos."
              </p>
              <p>
               Personally I think the ads should go and that an informed public should decide what is legitimate news.
              </p>
              <p>
               PLUS, no communication should any longer be a one-way street -- all messages to the public must 
have a way for the public to reply to them.  Otherwise, don't read the message.
