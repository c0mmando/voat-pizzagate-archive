            Also, the Tuam home case has nothing to do with Libya, and the NYT article doesn't even mention Denis O'Brien. I don't see how he is connected to the Tuam case.

            If you would like to point out to which conclusions your brainstorming has led you, please do so mainly in the comments. By using more concise headlines, your posts will get more traction.

           <p>
            The deceased children seem to have died of diseases, malnurishment and maltreatment, which is bad enough. I haven't seen legit sources that proved that they were killed on purpose or due to torture connected to possible sexual abuse, or even that there was sexual abuse at the home.
           </p>
           <p>
            It is worthwhile looking into this case nevertheless, it is a borderline/grey area topic we could accept imo. But we need legit sources that show the relevance for pizzagate.

            Sorry but there's no connection between Tuam babies and Denis O'Brien, much as I hate the man, or the IRA. Kincora is another story altogether

            anyone know more...so far I have found...If you have noticed lately there has been numerous articles about child abuse cases in Vatican and now we have the same situation going on in British Royal family and among high politicians in England. And I think, that for example pedophile Jimmy Savile was only the peak of the iceberg and there’s going to be a lot more. Here are just a couple of links, which have come into the light lately:

            wiki quote There also existed an MI6 honeypot for active pedophiles at Kincora boy's home during the 1970 .... 'Kincora Home' and such places were blackmail spots holding dirt on British loyalist terrorists and Irish Catholic terrorists, they were used to blackmail and subvert prominent establishment figures in Northern Ireland via surveillance.... The horrific revelations in recent years about high-level pedophile networks in the British ‘establishment’ have direct links to Northern Ireland. Central to those allegations is the Kincora boys’ home in Belfast that operated from 1958-1980. One of the Kincora house masters, William McGrath, was sentenced to four years in jail in 1981 for systematic sexual abuse of children in his care. McGrath was a member of the Orange Order and a far right ‘loyalist’ group known as ‘Tara‘ that sought to radicalize Northern Irish Protestantism in preparation for what he called a ‘doomsday’ scenario of outright civil war with Catholics.
           </p>
           <p>
            McGrath’s activities must, however, be placed in the context of his role as an MI5 agent. Evidence suggests that in the late 1960s McGrath’s pedophilia became known to MI5, and from then on he served only one master. It is likely that McGrath’s appointment as house master at Kincora in 1971 was also at the behest of his MI5 handlers who used McGrath and Kincora (and other children’s homes) to provide an outlet for their own sadistic pleasure and that of many prominent Northern Irish and British political and paramilitary figures. According to victim Richard Kerr, boys from Kincora (and other homes) were regularly trafficked to London for the enjoyment of British politicians in places like Dolphin Square and the Elm Guest House. Control of these individuals through knowledge and evidence of their crimes was likely the main goal, along with pushing forward MI5’s ‘low level civil war’ agenda.
           </p>
           <p>
            John McKeague, for example, was one of the founders of the Red Hand Commando, a loyalist paramilitary group that was responsible for dozens of murders of innocent Catholics in Northern Ireland in the 70s, 80s and 90s. McKeague was reportedly a regular participant in the child-raping sessions at Kincora. Shortly after being interviewed in 1982 by detectives investigating his involvement in Kincora, he was shot by the INLA, a Catholic nationalist paramilitary group. Two Irish and British journalists, Jack Holland and Henry McDonald have, however, stated that McKeague was killed by MI5 agents to prevent him naming Kincora regulars.

            By appointment of her majesty the Queen: pedophile, racist and all round good chap, Lord Mountbatten
           </p>
           <p>
            Former Chief of British Defence Staff and cousin to Her Majesty the Queen, Lord Mountbatten, has also been accused of child sexual abuse at Kincora and other homes north and south of the Irish border. While enjoying his yearly imperial holiday off the coast of Ireland’s County Mayo in the summer of 1979, Mountbatten was killed by an IRA bomb placed on his boat. Unless, of course, MI5 did it to silence him.....https://joequinn.net/2015/08/14/death-squads-pedophiles-and-psychopaths-inside-the-british-establishment/ The pedophile elite London had branches in the Netherlands - English version by Donde Vamos

            A week ago, we learned that a Conservative MP (d. 1995) Geoffrey Dickens warned the firm about Thatcher choking business pedophile. Which earned him direct threats and burglaries soon as he started talking about some people .
           </p>
           <p>
            From 1981 to 1985, Dickens tried to alert the Parliament on a pedophile who was in the film distribution pédopornos. But these remarks had no echo at the time.

            However, he cited a downright Peter Hayman, a diplomat and a member of MI6, as a pedophile who had escaped prosecution although he got caught with equipment pédoporno. In 1983, Dickens spoke of a pedophile network that involved personalities, “people in positions of power, influence and have responsibilities,” he threatened people swinging in Parliament....mi6....mi5...terrorists...the Roman Catholic Church...Libya....Ireland.....and 700 babies
