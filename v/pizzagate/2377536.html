<p>On December 13, 2017, Assistant Chief District Judge Honorable Tamara Yon of 9th Minnesota Judicial District vacated prior orders of the court that restricted Timothy Charles Holmseth’s (HOLMSETH) investigative journalism. The Order was based upon “a significant amount of evidence” HOLMSETH submitted in support of a MOTION TO VACATE.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Introduction to HOLMSETH’S Motion said: PETITIONER brings this MOTION TO VACATE because NEW EVIDENCE that was not available at the time of trial shows adverse parties within Minnesota law enforcement and the larger interstate judicial community, criminally and civilly conspired with agents of a private corporation that received support from the U.S. Military to strategically create life-threatening conflict in the life of Parties’ minor child REDACTED; conflict that would be used to justify court actions against Plaintiff’s constitutional rights for the illegal purpose of protecting a criminal enterprise of child sex trafficking and child pornography.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The delay in submitting the evidence, which HOLMSETH began acquiring in 2009, was caused by the seizure and destruction of HOLMSETH’S computer and hard drive by the East Grand Forks Police Department and Minnesota Pine to Prairie Gang and Drug Force in 2012.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The court hearing was held in the Family Division because HOLMSETH\'S parenting rights had been questioned amidst a conspiracy against HOLMSETH to cover up evidence of organized crime HOLMSETH acquired through his journalism.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The conspiracy was a ‘best interest of the child’ scheme intended to extort HOLMSETH into silence about what he learned, while simultaneously serving to discredit HOLMSETH in the public eye.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The evidence HOLMSETH submitted to the court included digital audio recordings of journalistic interviews, as well as other audio and documents obtained by HOLMSETH, that exposed key figures in an international baby and child sales operation involving operatives of the CIA, FBI, Department of Children and Families, private detectives, law enforcement, judicial officers, and other public officials.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The evidence HOLMSETH submitted contained actual conspiratorial communications between the East Grand Forks Police Department and CNN operative Art Harris who was working as a media agent for CIA operatives that were selling babies and children internationally.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The evidence contained in HOLMSETH’S MOTION TO VACATE revealed a massive conspiracy against HOLMSETH\'S rights and the cover-up of crimes against children.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The evidence showed HOLMSETH had obtained evidence from witnesses of international child sex trafficking and nefarious activity that involved high profile figures including Hillary Clinton, Marco Rubio, Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi, convicted Ponzi schemer Scott W. Rothstein, convicted pedophile Jeffrey Epstein, Attorney Gloria Allred, and a vast network of shadow government operatives staging out of Florida, Indiana, Minnesota, Colorado, and California.</p>

<p>This presentation is an expanded reflection of the very detailed timeline and fact pattern set forth in HOLMSETH’S MOTION TO VACATE, AFFIDAVITS/EXHIBITS, and AUDIOS</p>

            This headline on this submission is utter misleading bullshit. Timothy was working on this long before Q came along and it has nothing to do with "the storm." Timothy has been grinding away on this for years.

            Hello, I want to do further investigation into Podestas pig farm or (maybe bohemian grove, pegasus museum). I cant post for some reason so Im going to leave this comment here.
  (which he reportedly does the killing from 12pm to 4am) and set up a live stream for it on youtube. The problem is 1 I dont have a drone and 2 I dont live within the DC area (btw theres a resturant like Comet Ping Pong in the DC Area but even worse! Its also advertised as "family friendly". I was wondering if we could find some people who have drones or could set up hidden cameras (like the ones from this is why im broke.com) and try to actually get some footage to finally blow the lid off this pizzagate investigation and we could do drones AND cameras but you guys would have to take off the tracking numbers. So I thought it would be a great idea if the stream could start from multiple channels, have multpile drones/cameras, and start filming around these times. How many people on here have a youtube channel or own a drone? Theres strength in numbers also the hidden cameras are cheap so anyone living in the dc area could even just do that but you would have to be careful going out at night alone. We need to somehow get evidence, actual evidence that this pig farm/Pegasus/or Bohemian Grove actually use their hunting grounds to kill people which Ive heard many stories of, even one being on dr.phil. At Pegasus Museum there is spray paint with the word Kid and an arrow pointing down as if it were letting us know there are kids underground (which sizzlepie the pizzeria made a reference to the movie IT when Pennywise grabs the kids into the sewer underground and eats them! Yeah REALLY FUCKING WEIRD RIGHT?!)
 I hope in Jesus Name we can help these children somehow because I hate how people think its just a theory when they refuse to look into it and the fact that 800,000 kids a year go missing out of nowhere! Clearly child trafficking is something that is still happening and when the memos released it said the FBI was spying on the American People and they had a plot to overthrow trump! If the FBI can keep secrets like that, then why couldnt they keep a secret like Child Trafficking? Im honestly tired of the thought of Clinton or Podesta hurting another child. We need to expose these people.
My youtube Channel is Justiceingeneral and I have the photos from the restaurant there too.
