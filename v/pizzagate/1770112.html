            As I've said in every post I've made about the matter, it's not that I don't think we should take time to look into it if people think we should. I'm not disagreeing with that sentiment.

            You could be right, however what do we do when we find a dox containing all PG related people? Not dig? I believe we
            <em>
             will
            </em>
            be thrown off the scent, and that comes with the territory, surely?  How do we decide before we investigate, if it's related or not, a psyop or not?
           </p>
           <p>
            Imho we're digging just now, and have uncovered important information.  As

           <p>
            This appears to be a MK ULTRA type of tool box, imho.  MK ULTRA is important to us, and if we uncover tools, extremely important to us.
We found mentions of Madeline McCann and John Podesta.  Should we not have investigated?

             I haven't dug into the site-too chicken because I've already had to have my computer swept 3 times now digging in stuff from Wiki, but I'd be very curious if there's anything in that mess that talks about Max Spiers. He was exposing MK Ultra stuff and then mysteriously dies.

            I get why some would think this is a big psyop but wasn't this first discovered back in like 2006 on another forum from some guy who found a piece of paper on a bulletin board? If that's true, then how is PG/CPP known back then?
           </p>
           <p>
            Or are you saying someone who has control of this throws in every year's "new conspiracy theory" for each generation to stumble across? Doesn't make sense. There's apparently lists/phone numbers to very connected people. If those numbers are real, I think there's more to this than some random theories.

            I have the same feeling. There is very little actual information, just a lot of random strange stuff that takes time to go through. Would be interesting to know if those phone numbers work though.

             The phone numbers work apparently.  Various people tested them yesterday, one got through to Bill Clinton's secretary, another the office of George Soros. Many more.  Check the original thread for info.

              Ok. The contact info seemed legit, so im not surprised that the numbers work. It was just my gut feeling from all that random shit that it's a diversion. It will be looked through and then we'll know.

               Yea, it is random, but there's some extremely interesting information in there. You can see on the threads whats been found already. Here's a question. Assuming we will, as an investigation come across diversions, how do we know something's a diversion before we investigate?

                You are right. Im not saying it shouldn't be investigated. I was just saying my gut feeling out loud.
I even said in some topic that my money is on it being a diversion. As in making bets..

             I recently left a comment to that effect on the tread itself. While it felt mind-boggling when I first stumbled upon it, I must admit that now it seems very likely that much of the text was generated by a bot, that it does contain a great deal of conspiracy buzzwords inserted to seemingly no end, and that it's peculiar to have been discovered before without ever having led anywhere (especially considering how deep this hole appears to be). So yeah, not sold.

             This video feels like some sort of conspiracy-themed vaporwave (music genre).

               I said as much in the og thread and was told that someone reported already having done so in the very thread. Clinton's n Soros' secretaries supposedly answered at their offices. Can't say I blame whomever, if they in fact called, for not trying the Clintons on their home line. Lol.

            No the OPs point is its a general disinfo rabbit hole, where TPTB can just update and spread to catch and divert investigations into a morass of bullshit. I think ;-)

More people say it was found before, which is true.

             , however the website has evolved since then.  It's recently came online again, and is linked to a few other sites now too.  We're finding new information on them, previously undiscovered.

              . I respect that. I'm leaving the tentative warning up on the other thread just to keep people on their toes. Please ping me if someone finds something really solid that would lead me to switch the flair to "Potential Lead". I am willing to do it, if there is good reason to.

               !  I messaged you on that thread too with information that we found mentions of John Podesta and Madeline McCann on those sites. The dox also contains all PG related people, including Tamara Luzzetto and another Luzzetto we're trying to identify.  These points have me thinking that we have leads here.
              </p>
              <p>
               I hope you feel that this info is strong enough to change the flair to 'Potential Lead'.  Either way, thanks for your great support as always : )

                I commented in that thread also. Keep digging, but keep in mind that the doxing may be bait as well to incite a witchhunt by "crazy puritanical Christians". This fits the Share Blue disinfo campaign.
