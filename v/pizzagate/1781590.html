            If this is indeed true, the fact that he "went dark" for several weeks or at the very least covered his tracks is very strong circumstancial evidence.

           <p>
            If the emails were deleted, then the data might still exist on some Cloud like system, just like how some of the Hillary emails were discovered.

           <p>
            This is relevant to one of my theories for it made me realize what we might need to do. We need to find some "White Hats" in the intelligence community and seek their cooperation for they have the skills we need to find hard evidence.

            Human Cloning can be seen as an extension of the perverse pursuits of Nazi scientists, as one facet of a multifaceted occult oligarchy of all sectors of human life.
           </p>
           <p>
            We find pizza gate in the themes of popular culture, the literal dolls of a lifetime of programming, in the nefariously candy coated institute of the Disney Club. Is it any surprise we find Jack Dorsey, self-proclaimed Satanist, upon the board of it's directors? (Silicon Valley)
           </p>
           <p>
            Yes the secretive 33 club nestled in the magic kingdom, as a private members club, should peak the esoteric enthusiasts interest, for you see... There is a thread which will connect all of these institutions with the CIA and that of course, is the Tavistock institute.
           </p>
           <p>
            Military culture, political culture... The unnerving charm bracelet pizza bead sent to Obama... The rantings of a bipolar enamoured by the Bush girl, MKUltra victim on the Stratfor emails...
           </p>
           <p>
            The story of Madeleine McCann... Why was this girl chosen, of all the missing children... Was it because of the mark in her eye, which once was prophesied in viking times? The "Snake In The Eye", of the red haired descendants of Dan?
           </p>
           <p>
            (Factoid: Henry Kissinger's favourite film is China Town directed by Roman Polanski, which is a story of incest and an enigmatic mark within the eye which relates to the East... China Town.)
           </p>
           <p>
            Now with this in mind, we must ask ourselves, why should this girl's particular eye marking, continuously change? Sometimes, having been photoshopped out and other times, having changed position. source:

           <p>
            Another interesting observation, are the starkly varying ages of Kate McCann with the child.
           </p>
           <p>
            As well as this, in which way exactly does this connect to pizza gate?
           </p>
           <p>
            Well, I think you will find it most interesting that some of the fellows of George Washington University have successfully cloned people via embryo splitting methods.

           </p>
           <p>
            We ALL know, Madeleine was produced via IVF. This is not a conspiracy by any stretch of the imagination.
           </p>
           <p>
            Over the river from George Washington University, Gerry McCann was welcomed by Obama, to the White House.
            <a href="http://www.gerrymccannsblogs.co.uk/W24_7_7/gerry-mccann-gerry-mccann-visits-the-whitehouse-july-24-2007-0dx3BO.jpg">

            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            (Factoid: The Nazi's were obsessed with cloning... So much so, one Brazilian village was known to host a peculiar number of twins... It was the site where Mengele is alleged to have continued his work. Dr Green, or "Papa" as some of his victims still recall him.)
           </p>
           <p>
            How does George Washington University connect to pizza gate? Well, it is the work place of Amanda Kleinman of course! The university of Podesta... Purveyor of perversity for the pseudo intellectual classes, in their ill fitting designer suits.
           </p>
           <p>
            (Q. How on earth did Amanda Kleinman get a counselling/teaching post at George Washington University when she makes such controversial music?)
           </p>
           <p>
            So one of the main alleged culprits within the Pizzagate Saga, has no father listed in her family tree and teaches at a university where human cloning took place. Attended by John Podesta, who trained to be a Jesuit priest and who's brother, worked on brain research at MIT, before embarking on a career in politics.
           </p>
           <p>
            Oh my, doesn't the manchurian candidate just come to mind?
           </p>
           <p>
            Confirmed eye mark carriers: George Soros, Jacob Rothschild, George Webb, Kate Middleton
           </p>
           <p>
            Reeling in from the realms of bolt from the blue ideas, I hope I have successfully planted a seed of curiosity in your mind, which is palpable in a garden once consigned to the realms of fiction.
           </p>
           <p>
            Good Luck.

             Very interesting question. I don't think anyone has tried to find a correlation. I am not remotely up to speed as to what emails are even available from Hillary or anyone else of interest, but it would be remarkable if there were similar anomalies of missing blocks of emails around the same time.

            Wow. The shillery/anti-shillery is strong in this thread! There's very likely something to the genetic aspect of Maddie McCain's abduction. If what certain posters claim is true, then something in their genetic makeup is attractive to certain others, who obviously lack said genes. Pax 6, I believe...
           </p>
           <p>
            But that's not the point of PizzaGate. It's a separate issue, perhaps related in the abduction sense. But we're talking here about ritual rape, torture, and murder of children. We're not talking about cloning, or harvesting genetic material. Maybe in a Venn diagram, these two sets of sick fucks intersect. However, they are exclusive and we are after the child rape, torture, and murder faction of the global elite scum sick fucks.

             Actually, the child rape &amp; murder is the center with SRA, trafficking, organ harvesting, ect. intersecting. So, it is necessary to include all extensions to really see the big ugly picture.  The factions spread far &amp; wide like a malignant cancer.

                  You do realize they put RFID chips in dogs that are the size of the grain of rice. So why would a company not put aside some money for R&amp;D and make something smaller than the size of a bobby pin or the size of a stamp? Hell, why not make it flesh colored to blend in with his head? Why not even put it under the skin so you eliminate the chance of a picture like this?

            This is a bait and switch shill post. OP has been a member long enough to look legit. He re-posts something that he knows certain others here have an interest in. He has shill buddies that come in and play. Then he mocks (or he himself tries to remain legit looking and his buddies do the mocking).

            is it possible sonic hedge hog is being sincere but all these previous shills that have been on here today have come in and confused things? My feeling is he is NOT being sincere??

               We must fight these teams (yes they seem to be working in teams) I will keep exposing them! Sometimes people even go into all the BS they litter VOAT with.. This damages this investigation into looking an investigation done by morons. (wich can later easilly be debunked by MSM) Therefore it is important people are alerted that is BS-post by a Shill.

                I don't see that option... anywhere.   Idk.  Okay I will just ask it here. I have just recently been red pilled.. and I'm trying to take in everything the best that I can... but today has me completely lost and spinning in circles!!!  The_crux posted earlier saying that Amanda kleinman of majestic ape was actually not the same Amanda producing the art.. that it was an imposter and Amanda should sue them!! The fact that this art was from 2008 and her name on the art page was majestic ape seems really weird!!!! I thought I was literally talking to Amanda!!! It was creepy! Look into thr_crux and all of her submissions have been about this person, band etc. It's weird . Next sound_of_silence... he seems legit looking into his voat details and is heavily against the mods??? Is there something I'm missing??? Idk... I'm spinning in circles at the moment... then this guy named kevdude messaged me on the same thread of sound_of_silence did and told me not to trust this guy...this guy does not seem all that great according to his voat details..  like wtf?? I'm so confused and not sure what to believe.. I just need advice or comfort or something... idk?!?
               </p>
               <p>
                Edit: Amanda's art was pre-pizzagate so why would anyone try to frame her?? It also aligns with the band name change

                  Do your own research/cross reference everything and just ignore the shills ... or if it bothers you that much make a post about them...

                  Your question does not make sense, but I am now keenly interested in your viewpoint. When you say call me out, do mean when he says "Thanks to rwb, one of the best voters" in the thread body? If so, my conjecture would be that SonicHedgeHog has read some of my more elaborate posts, and merely appreciates my line of thinking. Can you elaborate on why this would be a cause for concern?

            Sonic, just to get this right, are you highlighting the fact that JP stopped writing or answering his mails from the day before McCann's disappearance, until 6 weeks after?  (as per the info // leaks we have)?

                No, not you in the least. Sometimes the flow of thought just goes right over my head, and I just turned to the first normal poster in the thread I could spy. For what it's worth, I've just finished reading the OP's comment history. There is  nothing that leads me to believe anything other than good intention. The OP felt my observation was important enough to warrant a stand alone thread, and was free to exercise their VOAT prerogative in posting it.

                 Oh I'm glad, thanks for clarifying. It's been a night of craziness on here I feel, and I'm glad I haven't offended you unintentionally. And yes, I checked the OP's posts and like you, felt they were genuine, idk. I'm lost with it all actually!

                   myself and others have been in a rabbit hole investigating into odd genetic research and things similar to MK Ultra .  The science gets complicated so people like

                   become confused and discredit the extensive efforts into these things.  The metabolic pathways and gene expressions associated to M. Mccann's disorder are allegedly of interest to people seeking mind control &amp; or blood extracts for genetic studies etc.   The sick shit begins to expose itself when investigating intent driven torture for increased production of things like adrenaline, melanin, serotonin and or other endocrine system produced fluids.

                    has a very big brain and caused others to look even deeper into areas such as genetics causation. For anyone who has studied history you will know this is exactly what was being studied prior to WW11.

                   <p>
                    Prior to WW11 just as the intensity of genetics and blood chemistry studied were intensifying psychological trauma was also being studied.
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    As a direct result of WW1 when Stockholm Syndrome was first observed. Sigmeund Freud played a role in this study. They did not study this to help soldiers though, they studied this because they were on the cusp of seeing trauma based dissociation. Freud was actually a brutal pedophile who blamed children, even infants for sexually desires.

                    For those who say he was discounted or Dr. Jung had different ideas I would ask why do they still have s statue in his honor at "the lab" And Dr. Jung was an intelligence agent that worked directly with Allen Dulles...."founder" of CIA.

                   <p>
                    They set out to master trauma based mind control which involved intentionally "altering" a child through horrific trauma between age two and four splitting the consciousness and programming.

                    Okay.. I understand.  I am a sexual abuse victim at the age of 3. I have been diagnosed with borderline personality disorder which is the same as dissociative disorder... So I know the implications that these people have... I have ptsd as well... I was not a government trafficking victim thank God!!! But I still suffer daily... :(  I would suggest adding border line personality disorder to your research... It has actually been dubbed a new current disorder as multiple personality disorder and I have now recently been named chronic depressive disorder... perhaps that will help your investigation??? Not sure.. hope I helped.  Pedophiles are pure evil and ruin our lives forever!!!!!!! They must be stopped!!

                     I have So many things to say. And not the time now.  Thanks for being part of this community as we've got to work together with good attitudes.  Thought patterns cause chemical changes in the  body and understanding how to balance is helpful.

                     I'm so sorry you've gone through this. Do you happen to know your blood type?

                     I ask just because I'm keeping a list of folks I find that have been victims and seeing if there is a blood type correlation.

                     You don't get it. That is fine.  Maybe some higher education may help.  Try chemistry and genetics if you want to understand this.

                         So are you saying none of this has to do with mind control or genetics.  Is there no such thing as A REAL LIFE MANCHURIAN CANDIDATE?

                            become confused and discredit the extensive efforts into these things." AND "You don't get it. That is fine. Maybe some higher education may help." Maybe its time for you and your higly educated genetics expert group to get out of that Flat Earth rabbithole away from the aliens. Now who is the problem? Me pointing out a Shill that damages this investigation with Alien genetics bullshit? (but believe me i have many many more signals he is a SHILL!) or maybe you, trying to defend this Obvious Shill?

                              It was me all about an Obvious Shill, who is on a differend mission here. To post about things to make this investigation look like its done by morons, so can easily be debunked by MSM. These people need to be exposed, not defended. So that was not very nice what you said about me, needing higher education because i did not get it like you said. This is not my language, so possibly comes over differend.. But i am not a stuppid guy and not many have that high IQ, i can tell you that. When i make an accusation of someone being a shill, i looked at that person.
