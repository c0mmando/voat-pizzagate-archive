<p>Media Matters, established by David Brock in 2004, has never made a secret of its loyalties. It attacks Fox and other conservative outlets on behalf of the Clintons. Period. It got Glenn Beck fired from Fox, for example. With around $8-12 million per year in funding and 70-90 employees, it is one of the biggest dedicated Clinton-controlled operations in existence. If the Clintons are engaged in drug trafficking or sex slavery or treason, then Media Matters will be protecting them on those things too.</p>
<p>As a start, I encourage everyone to read <a href="http://nymag.com/news/media/david-brock-media-matters-2011-5/">this pro-Brock piece</a>. It\'s longish but it gives a vivid picture of how Media Matters came to exist and how normies on the left perceive Brock, his very close relationship with the Clintons, and his non-relationship with Obama.</p>
<p>For a much less admiring view of Brock and Media Matters, you can then go <a href="https://www.activistfacts.com/organizations/media-matters-for-america/">here</a>. Notice that even his closest friends and co-workers think he\'s paranoid and unstable. 
But as ActivistFacts can only do so much, let me add a couple of additional facts about Brock. He is also engaged in <a href="https://www.change.org/p/united-states-department-of-justice-audit-david-brock-s-media-matters-conglomerate">a complex multi-level skim of the funds donated to Media Matters</a>, through 14 different front organizations. (See Item #5 especially.)  And in 2011, <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2107394/Media-Matters-founder-David-Brock-accuses-gay-ex-lover-blackmailing-850K.html">he paid $850,000 in blackmail</a> to an ex-lover to conceal his various fraud schemes.</p>
<p>Could Brock himself be HLI?  Brock knows an incredible number of secrets, about the left and the right. He\'s obsessed with information domination, a &quot;scope dope&quot; who spends 16 hours per day on details. But he has huge fundraising and managerial responsibilities, and he is just too much of a public figure to do the dirty work involved.</p>
<p>For this operation, you must have someone else who knows the whole ugly truth -- such as who is a willing pedo, who was blackmailed with an underage girl, who takes bribes, where the sex slaves come from, which countries are buying foreign policy favors, and so on. That person then crafts memes and rumors (reviewed and approved by Brock) that are often more outrageous than the truth, but that consistently and subtly point away from it. If they\'re actually getting their slaves from Haiti, then maybe he says they\'re kidnapping middle-class white girls from Disneyland. And so on. He fills up the anti-Clinton online space with false leads and confusion. I say this to all the folks who think Obama is CIA, or there\'s a Nazi base in Antarctica, or the British Royal Family runs the world: Consider where you first heard that idea. There\'s a good chance it came, via some convoluted route, from this guy. Or at least, he tried hard to ensure you heard that story instead of something else. (There\'s also someone who does this job for the Bush family. They\'ve been at this a looong time.)</p>
<p>This person has to be highly educated, not just in politics and current affairs, but in every sort of wacky conspiracy theory and urban legend. This includes an encyclopedic knowledge of freemasonry and mystery cults, <a href="https://voat.co/v/CAJI/2173213">something which HLI shows off regularly</a>. He would have to be quick and self-confident, a good writer and off-the-cuff speaker, because there won\'t always be time in a chat room or AMA to go look stuff up. And of course, he would have to be a sadistic, lying psychopath who likes working for other sadistic, lying psychopaths. This person might not be a pedo himself, but he will have seen and done enough soul-destroying shit that he can be trusted to do this very dangerous and delicate job.</p>
<p>I know one question that will be on people\'s minds: Where is the actual government while all of this is happening? What about the CIA and the mockingbird press and all that? I will cover that in an upcoming segment, but for now just understand that none of these people trust each other, and with good reason. Hillary would never rely on the CIA or NSA or anyone she didn\'t control directly to do work like this. Nor would Brock. The guy has armed bodyguards. He\'s a paranoid\'s paranoid.</p>
<p>In all likelihood, there is only one person doing this specific job in the Clinton machine. It\'s a hard job to fill, and in a rational security setup, he wouldn\'t have junior assistants working for $15 an hour. He would need direct access to the gigantic Media Matters database, but it would need to be anonymous access. There\'s no vague job title that would work here; he can\'t be tucked away in a cubicle in the corner. He\'s a contractor, working remotely, and very likely nobody deals with him apart from Brock himself, and occasionally someone in IT.</p>
<p>He will not come cheap. Just for the skill set alone, we\'re talking at least $150K per year. Remember, this is a 24/7 job. He has to jump on developing trends within hours, stay up all night in chat rooms, whatever it takes. And he is liable under the RICO statutes for all the human trafficking and bribery and treason that he is covering for, whether he witnessed it or not.</p>
<p>Now here we catch a big break, because a group of citizen investigators has established that Media Matters <a href="http://www.zerohedge.com/news/2016-12-14/david-brocks-media-matters-has-hidden-1052500-irs-2010">has been hiding a money pot of just the right size to fund this guy</a> since 2010. Brock also has a front organization, the Bonner Group, that skims off a large portion of the incoming donations before they get to MM (again, see Item #5 mentioned above). I can\'t prove that HLI gets paid out of either slush fund, of course, but he has to get paid from somewhere, and that money won\'t be coming out of Brock\'s personal pocket, or Hillary\'s. Let the liberal investors in MM pay him!</p>
<p>What I\'m trying to get across here is that if you believe what is written about MM and Brock, and you believe in Pizzagate, then it\'s like the old saying about God: If HLI did not exist, it would be necessary to invent him. Someone like him is absolutely inevitable in our world.</p>
<p>All this is a lot to digest during a fast-moving news cycle -- wow, so much good news these days! -- but I hope you will take the time. It will strengthen your understanding of everything around you.</p>

            You got something wrong. There are two "High Level Insiders". The first one is the one who started posting on 4chan in 2016 yet originated prior to that date on Reddit (different name) starting around 2013. The one you see on Voat and Reddit using the "HighLevelInsider" name is a con.
