              Take a look at Hemophilia B and the royal family. Its genetic. Also google "Kerth Barker blood drinking addiction" 
It appears to have been drank for health reasons and its also as addictive as crack according to Kerth Barker. Some people are sexually turned on by the smell of blood. They like to rub it on themselves and rape children. Its a sick world.

               The AshkeNazi have more genetic disorders than any other people, more than 28 if I recall. Tay sachs( cured by blood and marrow transfusions from the children), Blooms, and so many others. Their bodies and souls are so foul they are degenerating faster than any other race of mankind. There is a reason Israel is one of the biggest Organ Harvesting countries, jews need their spare parts. So many secret societies of blood consuming freaks, The jews and goyim who do this shit are a sure sign that the rot of this world is advancing much too fast. When fucking cannibalism becomes normal, whats next?

                Thats why they often dry the blood to a powdered form and save it for long term use. i read a "fictional" story once of people going into back room blood transfusion setup, shellout some shekels, getting their transfusion, and going about their day as if its just a normal thing. This is why in the historical records the blood was always "shared with others." Apparently they had a network of killing, butchering, and distribution.

                Jacob Astor (i think its jacob) of the infamous Astor family was a poor "butcher" by trade when he came to the U.S. He then miraculously cornered the market in the fur trade and became one of the wealthiest people in the world.

                 The original founder of the Astor fortune was John Jacob Astor (1763-1848). John Jacob Astor was born in Walldorf, Duchy of Baden (Germany) from a Jewish bloodline. The Jewish origins have been hidden, and quite a number of various ideas of the Astor’s heritage have been put into circulation by the Astors. John Jacob Astor was a butcher in Walldorf.

                <p>
                 In 1784, he came to America after a stop over in London, England. Although the story is that he came to America penniless--and that may be true--he soon joined the Masonic Lodge, and within 2-3 years had become the Master of the Holland Lodge No. 8 in N.Y. City. (This Holland Lodge is a prominent lodge in that many of its members have good connections to the Illuminati elite(Jewish Freemasonry invented by Weishaupt). An example of just one Lodge #8 member is Archibald Russell, 1811 - 1871, whose father was President of a real hotbed of Illuminati action for many years: The Royal Society of Edinburgh).
                </p>
                <p>
                 By 1788, Astor was a master of Masonic lodge#8. This is rather interesting considering Astor could not speak English when he arrived in America, and supposedly was very poor. John Jacob Astor was always very famous for being coldhearted, anti-social, “a man who didn’t have charm, wit or grace.” (This quote comes even from a relative of the DuPont family who wrote a sympathetic Biography entitled The Astor Family.) If this man lacked social graces and was so cold, and was so poor during his first years in the U.S., why did he rise to such prominence in Freemasonry?
                </p>
                <p>
                 Certainly not because of his social graces. For instance, one time later in life at a meal given for elites, when his hands got dirty at the table he reached over and used the shirt of the man beside him to wipe his hands. The original financial break came by carrying out a series of shady and crooked real estate deals in the N.Y. city area.
                </p>
                <p>
                 The next break came when two men who are now known to have been in the Illuminati gave John Jacob Astor a special government privilege. The two men were Pres. Jefferson and Secretary Gallatin--both Illuminati members. The United States government had placed an embargo on all U.S. ships from sailing with goods in 1807. But Astor got special permission from these two men for his ship to sail with its cargo.
                </p>
                <p>
                 His ship sailed and made close to a $200,000 profit in that day’s money. Astor strangely profited greatly from the War of 1812, which crippled almost all the other American shippers. Astor also worked together with George Clinton, another member of the Illuminati, on land deals. Even at that period in history, British intelligence worked for the Committee of 300 and for the Thirteen Top Families, it is interesting then, that John Coleman who had access as an intelligence agent to secret documents, discovered that the original John Jacob Astor was also a British secret agent.
                </p>
                <p>
                 The Thirteen Families have very intimate roles with the American and British intelligence cults.

                  And the final ironic twist is that these people are not really "jews" at all. They are a criminal clique that very likely originated from somewhere in Eastern Europe who claim to be jews in order to hide behind a religious doctrine. Their religion is nothing more than a criminal evolutionary strategy of depravity.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  One of the most interesting theories I have seen as to their origin is that they may have survived the last ice age on the leeward side of the Pyraneese Mountain range. Leeward meaning leeward of the wind. On that side of the mountain range some sort of temperature inversion happens and causes it to be several degrees warmer. I have no idea if that is true but its interesting.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  Another theory is that they may have orginated in the steppe lands of China and were chased away by the Chinese for their disgusting behavior and inability to stop stealing, lying, fucking animals, and drinking the blood of children.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  Whatever their origin most agree that they ended up in the area of the Black and Caspian seas and established the Khazar Empire. Their King Bulan adopted the Talmud (converted to jews) and Bred with the Turks and became a Mongol Turko Edomite mixture of some sort. Their desire to drink blood was so strong that Ceasar reported that they drank the blood of their own horses.

                   They have been at this a long time, the ancient Habiru(hebrew) were slavers, murderers, whores, and thieves.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   All their texts even the OT have an obsession with blood and murder. The newer stuff like the Talmud, Zohar, Kaballah, all of it has the same notes of Jewish Supremecy and hatred for non jews, and how to subvert and abuse them for power. Especially the Talmud with its detailed laws on how to rape children over 3 years and 1 day old, sick evil people. They were and still are Asiatics of arabic descent, the Khazars interbred with them to some extent and that gave us the Ashkenazi as far as I can tell, although they may have taken on that phenotype when interbreeding with Romans or other European peoples, as they are always looking to "upgrade" their inbred and diseased DNA for health reasons and to subvert their host nations.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   The sephardi and mizrahi look exactly like their arabic brethren. I guess my point is they were always vile, back stabbing, murderous, nation wrecking, wretched people and time has not made them any less bloodthirsty, infact the Khazarians or White looking Ashkenazi seem to have made it worse as they can sometimes pass for a White man or woman, and subvert any good or positive change. I agree with much of what you said, it is hard finding out the truth behind the history of the greatest liars and plagiarists ever. Thanks for the links btw, I am aware of Eustace Mullins and his works.

              The Rabbi's son Ariel Toaff who wrote about it as well as numerous others, and many others over 3,000 years agree. These stupid fuckers were sacrificing children to Moloch more than 2,000 years ago. But the disingenuous kikes and shills always pop up to argue verifiable facts with nothing but their worthless opinion and critical theory., These facts they do not want Publicly Known, evil bastards covering for this type of behaviour, they willfully cover for pedo's and murderers it is revolting..Spirit Cooking by jewess Marina Abramovitch and Skippys Pizza parties, to Talmudic gentile murder and blood letting its all connected by hooked snouts and rubbing hands.

               "Propaganda" ? No doubt you've spent many years studying unrelated accounts of jewish ritual murder and found them baseless, right? 
Well, a Jewish-Italian scholar and historian, Ariel Toaff (himself son of the chief rabbi of Rome) begs to disagree with you. His books "Blood Passover" proves meticulously that various groups of  Ashkenazi joos did actually steal and crucify christian children, and after draining their blood, used it for religious rituals. Toaff focuses in particular on the case of Simon of Trent. Simon was only 2-year-old when on the eve of Passover 1475, he was kidnapped by Ashkenazi Jews from his home in the Italian town of Trent. Simon was murdered, his body mutilated and crucified head down. Needless to say, Prof. Toaff was "crucified" himself by his fellow tribesmen and ADL.  Yet, he lived to apologize, retract and republish a revised edition of his work.

                 I know, you are the smartest mongrel in your yeshiva since you know many non-Yiddish words. But words a tribe has used to minimize or deny its crimes don't matter. What matters is the signified, not the signifier. To translate in a language you'd understand (using a dictionary): a murder of a child is a murder no matter how the murderer refers to it. Do you have a comment on the historicity of the human sacrifice practices described by Dr. Toaff? Was my comment over your head?
