<p>Hold onto your hats, folks, the Storm is upon us and Patrick Byrne is helping it sweep out the Deep State scum. He hinted at the FBI having a cabal of Deep State agents within the FBI ... and focused on one in particular who gave him \'\'fishy orders\'\' that didn\'t seem right. Well, now he\'s resigned from his company amidst threats that it, and his life, would be ground into dust and revealed the name of this Deep State agents on FOX and the name is: PETER STRZOK!</p>
<p>Holy shit! For those of you who thought this didn\'t have legs, this should prove the validity of what Byrne is talking about. There would be no way in hell he\'d resign from the company he built and dare put himself up against the very well-connected STRZOK without a very good reason to do so. It\'s not a position anyone would choose to be in because they were launching a new bitcoin stock?!!! No, I do not think so. </p>
<p>Byrne is the man! I say, &quot;Go, Patrick Byrne!\'\' If he really does have the goods on that asshole Strzok, he\'s just passed it onto AG Barr and that\'s good for all of us. It\'s the hook to get to senior people over Strzok and the beginning of some pretty interesting arrests. </p>

<p>I\'m sure there are some that are still skeptical, but think of the way the Deep State works in putting wrap-up smears out to discredit people. They\'ve already down it with Byrne in news reports that label him as slightly loony. How the hell does a guy who creates a multi-million dollar business get labeled a loony tune?

            Thanks for the research!
           </p>

            Ok. So if your theory is valid, which it very well may be, put it to the test. If your theory is correct that this story has legs then what is your prediction as to who will be arrested and when.? For example if this story is significant which it may be then Peter strzok has to be arrested with others above and below him. If not this goes in the memory hole.
           </p>
           <p>
            Don't get me wrong it proves once again that the shadow government is alive and well or at least was and that all us conspiracy nuts are correct. But the Deep State doesn't care how much people know about the Deep state. In fact the very phrase deep state is now being used by MSM, probably without any compensation to Peter Dale Scott.
           </p>
           <p>
            Consider me skeptical. Why is that? Well consider Julian Assange and Wikileaks Edward Snowden and the revelation of prism and Mass surveillance think of all the dirt that people know about Hillary and Bill, all the murders suicides Etc and then 2 the top it all off pizzagate is being fully revealed in front of the sheeples eyes! With mainstream news sounding like Prison Planet what do we get? That's right ... absolutely nothing besides vindication. And the Deep State doesn't give a shit about how we feel whether we feel right wrong Vindicated excetera.
           </p>
           <p>
            Now they're telling us there's going to be cannibalism alongside pedophilia and God knows what else! What will waken the people to action? And I'm here to tell you that nothing will until their children can't go to college house is it being foreclosed upon on a mass level Law &amp; Order breaks down the transit system fails people can't get to work there is no work xcetera ...that situation will be the game changer. It's all about the economy. So my theory is this this is just a burp. No changes will occur to the infrastructure of the deep State until the economy changes. People will be looking for scapegoats and solutions that's what people likes Peter strzok's will be arrested.

             My prediction? My prediction would be that this story runs along the same fault line as those FISA reports ... you know ... the ones they're still battling about releasing and the ones that -- allegedly -- carry damning information about Strzok. They're part and parcel of getting those out and, most likely, bolster a lot of of what's in there in exposing this ''destructive Deep State''. The documents Byrne turned over could be the needed justification for digging deeper and into making those records public. You know, the records Wray does not want you to see. Here are two links concerning Wray battling to keep ''Team Comey'' safe and secure because remember ... this would not only give us Strzok ... it would give us Comey on a plate.

             So do Byrnes' documents give leverage and perform heavy lifting? Oh, yes, I think they do.
            </p>
            <p>
             And, no, I do not agree with your assessment of what will wake the sleeping masses up. You've got to take into account that everyone has been masterfully indoctrinated for years. Every since Watergate, Dems have been wearing that crown ... that halo of fighting the evil empire and being beyond reproach. They're carefully crafted heroes that have cloven feet. Use Bill Cosby as an example. He was so freakin' beloved and iconic, that when the sex allegations arose, people used the excuse of The Cosby Show being so important to civil rights, that the charges should be overlooked? Well, that turned around quickly AFTER reputable witnesses and stories arose. The whole House of Cards fell and Mr. Cosby went to prison. It was barely a story at that point.
            </p>
            <p>
             So if evidence ... and I'm talking PROOF not theories advanced in forums like these ... comes out about pedophilia and cannibalism amongst the rich and famous, you best believe America ... and the world ... will wake the hell up! This is global. We all know that, but does everyone else? No. Hence the #GreatAwakening. And that statement about conspiracy theory sites is not a slam against the wonderful patriots who spend hours doing investigative work to unbury deep dark secrets and bring them to life. It's because of this army of unpaid journalists that this is being exposed. The legitimate news couldn't touch the stories, but we did. We not only touched on them, we speculated and posted some pretty brilliant submissions.
            </p>
            <p>
             So thanks for the post. Stay skeptical. Stay vigilant. And we'll see.

              Your optimism is refreshing. There's also a third scenario. Declassified files I watch for a false flag MCE to dominate the news for a week. Story goes away. I much prefer your scenario so I will think positively along those lines I agree especially the researchers on pizzagate some of the best research I've ever read and I only have great admiration for you and others who had the time and the desire to bring the stuff to light keep up the great work Patriot!

               No. There's no way he'd bring in the CIA if this wasn't true. They are scary, scary men and no one would want them up their butt hole so they could have a little press.

                Is it the CIA not allowed to do domestic stuff still? What's it like to take away from the church committee? Anyway this Overstock guy his Revelations are exactly what people have been talking about right from the beginning.

                 I do not think they're allowed, but they do all the time anyway. It's off the topic of pizzagate, but the CIA drains money from companies all the time by setting up "phony" companies to act as vendors. They get idiots to do the work for half-price and pocket the rest. Lord knows what they're investing that cash in.
