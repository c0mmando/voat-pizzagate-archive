            Maybe get some stickers printed up and just lean up against places where you place them (hands behind back) so no one can see.

            Hum, sounds like it would have to be someone who knew you were posting flyers and live in your neighborhood for it to be pizzagate related. 
Is the brother's business transaction a hostile takeover? angry employees? 
Did any other neighbors have slashed tires? 
Have there been any other weird things happening with either of you?
           </p>
           <p>
            Do a search for register sex offenders in your area so you atleast know where they are and don't park near them. Maybe wear a hat and glasses when you are out doing this, keep a camera handy in case anyone confronts you,   bring a friend or dog with you. if things get worse, post again. stay safe!

             I did post some within like a mile of our place I think the first or second time I distributed some out. So you're right maybe we do know them.
            </p>
            <p>
             It's not an intense type of business (its not like a law firm or something) but I think some people are peeved they didn't get the offer? I'm not entirely sure, I kind of wanted to figure out if that was what happened before I told him about my PG suspicion. Because, well, I bet he'll think I'm insane or something. But our safety is more important than that.
            </p>
            <p>
             That's a really good idea about maybe wearing some stuff to conceal my ID, and we do seem to have a lot of sex offenders around us because we live in the city. Thank you so much for your reply!

              I totally admire what you are doing, but do not put yourself in danger. I would try to rule out your brothers people first since it is his car and slashing tires seems a directed attack.  can you keep the car in the garage? call the police and ask if this happening to other people near you.
             </p>
             <p>
              the thing about pizzagate is that these people are predators with no remorse and are consistently above the law in most of their activity, they are dangerous like a wild animal so DO be paranoid. hopefully it was just neighborhood kids on a drunken spree.

             So I should tell him my suspicions and stop distributing flyers? Man, I feel like an idiot.

              Don’t feel like an idiot.  Big up to you for the effort, but you have to ensure your safety.  You may have a job convincing your brother though, depends how awake he is.  It may be a case of coincidence but I’d err on the side of caution  because if this is something related it would be better he knows.

               Yeah, you're totally right. I need to man up and tell him. He's about as woke as the general population, he's a Trump supporter at least and knows the fucked up shit the Clintons have done. But I mean I don't think anyone would take this news well. Damn. Thank you for the reply!
