This is extremely important suppressed knowledge. It cannot be overstated how much we all need to learn the Trivium Method. It is still taught to this day, but only in ivy league prep schools ($$$) and military/DOD (because they want critical thinkers)(I have personally spoken with sons and daughters of DOD officials over the years and confirmed this). It is not taught in public education (no $) any longer and was taken out of public education (as far as I know) sometime around the 1900\'s here in the US anyway. It is taught in $$$ schools which produce critically thinking individuals who go on to become CEOs, Presidents, International lawyers, etc. (people who make lots of $$$ with critical thinking skills regardless of their moral integrity). It is not taught in public education, where most tradesmen come from. For millenia, we as humans have embraced what we know as the Servile Arts such as a Carpenter (most know the trades or tradesmen or the Servile trades; notice the term Servile), the Liberal Arts (to Liberate, look it up) such as Lawyers, and the Fine Arts such as painting. I don\'t know about any of you, but I haven\'t had any time to do any painting because I\'ve been too busy being a tradesmen slave. Our oppressors have been able to keep us in a state of self-hypnotic child-like arrested development by witholding the tools necessary to allow people to process information (as well as one giant appeal to authority for valid truth).Now we have Common Core which spits out robots for corporations. People, parents and teachers have been saying for years this is a problem. Few know of the Trivium although it is very widely used.</p>

This brings me to Logical Fallacies. As far as I can tell, logical fallacies are about 90% of all the shillery going on around here. You can see clearly an example of fallacious reasoning (as well as NLP(neuro-linguistic programming) and NVC(non-violent communication)) here:
 <a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1470365/7123113">https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1470365/7123113</a>     and my reply:   <a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1470365/7135342">https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1470365/7135342</a> 
I highly recommend viewing some of the initial arguments made in the first few comments... <a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1470365">https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1470365</a>
 Regardless of what you believe about the shooter, this is blatantly obvious fallacious reasoning. Fallacies are either intentional or unintentional. But the important part here is that we\'re not just listing in a sea of sophistry (where one can\'t know anything, essentially. Kantian bullshit. Sophistry has been around for millenia, too) where we can\'t find the truth. These fallacies have been labeled and outlined and dicussed and broken down and explained for millenia. Most, simply don\'t know how often. For instance, if one has a legitimate argument and another comes along and says, \'I don\'t  believe you because you\'re an idiot,\' that would be an obvious fallacy called ad hominem attack (some of this is basic journalism). To simply attack the character of the person instead of confronting the argument with logic. Knowing this, one can simply identify it for what it is and declare the person guilty of using such and such fallacy and move on thereby discrediting the persons claim rendering them dejected until they can come up with another one that we\'ll love \'em for...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now, I\'m not suggesting that we all take time to solely devote our time to learning the trivium for it would detract from life and this research, etc. But, as I\'m a slave and work all the time, I have been able to fit in at least one hour a day to this and I can tell you with confidence how much this has increased my ability to process information in real time and be able to not only see through logical fallacies in peoples\' arguments but also to help them understand where they\'re wrong so that they can grow and develop, too. If they are obstinate, then you know what to do...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Speaking of the Liberal Arts... as a carpenter I always knew of the \'Carpenter\'s triangle,\'  or that\'s what I had always heard it called. How to determine square with little reference. It\'s the 3-4-5  ratio of finding 90 degrees. Well, that\'s actually the Trivium. The 3 represents the Trivium, the 4 represents the Quadrivium (arithmetic which is number, geometry which is number + space, music which is number + time, and cosmology which is number + space + time) and the 5 represents man\'s (or woman\'s) five senses or how man (or woman) comes to know the truth in the reality around him, er, her. The trivium and quadrivium together make up the seven liberal arts: Grammar, Logic, Rhetoric, Arithmetic, Geometry, Music, Cosmology). There is so much more but for research purposes, learn the Trivium and learn about logical fallacies. Good luck, folks; The collecive beating heart of humanity.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Excuse my bad grammar, please. Yes, I know, trivium. I\'m still learning. And if I have anything incorrect, please point it out.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And Phobos, I\'m using you as an example so quit your shit...and don\'t try to marginalize this.</p>',

            The manuals used by intelligence agencies to modify internet forum communications have been leaked and people on the internet figured out most of the techniques ages prior to that. All that's required is diligence and a sense of civic duty toward your public spaces (internet forums).  Have the discipline to not feed the trolls, have the courage to call them out as you see them, have the energy to mark them down if your forum allows it.  Have the persistence to not be distracted, or have your conversation derailed.  Have the awareness to know who your enemy is and what their intentions are, then have the clarity to proceed regardless.  They're easy to beat in a fair match - they only win when they buy the house.  Voat isn't owned by them.

            There is no logical fallacy in advocating that there be no promotion of violence within this forum.  If you see one, you need to make it crystal clear.

             Perhaps you misunderstood... The logical fallacy began with Phobos' assertion that I '... disliked a post about not being violent.' See for yourself:
             <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/v/pizzagate/1470365/7130262">
              https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1470365/7130262
             </a>
             One can clearly see from my rebuttal,
             <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/v/pizzagate/1470365/7135342">
              https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1470365/7135342
             </a>
             , that 'I stated quite clearly that I agree about no violence but disagree with acknowledgement of gunman.' Seems to be a form of the 'begging the question' fallacy. I don't make this stuff up because I'm hurt. On the contrary, it is because I do
             <strong>
              <em>
               not
              </em>
             </strong>
             use
             <strong>
              <em>
               emotions
              </em>
             </strong>
             to guide my logic that I am able to see through these logical fallacies. This stuff was already made up by humans long before I arrived, both fallacies and their deliverance, logic. In regards to your second statement: No disrespect, but I shouldn't have to point this out. That is the beauty in learning the Trivium; you can spot the fallacies and thus it will become crystal clear. Good luck to you.

             How is spreading word of one of the greatest tools of critical thinking for humans considered SPAM? I always noticed a pattern of negative behaviour, hasty generalization (which is a fallacy), and spreading misinformation to be SPAM... You?

              That's like massively disconnected from the investigation.
             </p>
             <p>
              You can make the argument that it's in line because you need logic to investigate.  But, if it's not the shills posting the vast majority are logical people on this site.
             </p>
             <p>
              Then you have the fact that what in essence is being taught is linguistic logic rules.  Nobody needs to read a 60 page doc (much less a whole course) to understand that TRUE XOR FALSE -&gt; TRUE then apply those rules to language.  Just go look at some truth tables learn some basic discreet math, and get on with your day.

               Normally, I would agree to disagree. But I must make exception in your case...
Like, a massive disconnection would be if I had posted something pertaining to Fly larva being used to feed the homeless which are giving birth to the orphans who are victimized here and it is that very larva which has caused typhoid to break out in Namibia, which in turn... you get the point. I did in fact make the argument that logic is necessary for sound reasoning in research... 
'But, if it's not the shills posting the vast majority are logical people on this site.' -- For one, I can't tell what you mean. For another, if I were to assume that I did, then it seems you are making an improvable assertion. Namely that the vast majority are logical people on this site... whiich itself is a logical fallacy, the fallacy of argumentum ad ignorantium. To assert that 'the vast majority are logical people on this site' is appealing to ignorance in that it is impossible to prove. It is unnecessary to try and prove that which does not exist.
'Then you have the fact that what in essence is being taught is linguistic logic rules' -- the claimant has the onus of proof. Ball's in your court, there. However, it sounds like you're using binary logic. Which is fine for computing, theory in arithmetic and cosmology, etc. but not for reasoning. If humans were to use binary logic to fulfill all of our tasks and solve our problems we would be automatons. It is for the reason of man's volition, that Aristotelian logic is needed.
