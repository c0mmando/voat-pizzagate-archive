<p>The former Sparta mayor and police captain who went missing in Vermont last week sent a suicide note and personal items to family after leaving New Jersey, local police said.</p>
<p>Brian Brady, 57, was reported missing on May 30, the day before Vermont State Police found his rental car in a parking lot near the Champlain Bridge in Addison, Vermont, police said. Police divers subsequently and unsuccessfully searched Lake Champlain for two days.</p>
<p>...Brady, a Sparta town councilman from 2006 to 2010, also served as mayor from 2008 to 2009. <strong>A former police officer with the New Jersey Department of Human Services, Brady has been involved in criminal court proceedings since May 2011.</strong> </p>
<p>Charged that month with criminal misconduct, Brady was later sentenced to a year of probation for asking a dispatcher to perform unauthorized background checks, court records show. A state appeal of that March 2015 sentence had Brady set for resentencing on May 31, Superior Court records from Mercer County show. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Acting Attorney General John J. Hoffman announced that a suspended police captain with the New Jersey Human Services Police has been convicted at trial on charges that he misused police databases for personal purposes.</p>
<p>Brian Brady, 52, of Sparta, was found guilty by Superior Court Judge Andrew J. Smithson following a six-week bench trial in Mercer County.  Judge Smithson found Brady guilty of second-degree counts of official misconduct and computer theft.  Each of those charges carries a sentence of five to 10 years in state prison.</p>
<p>.....Judge Smithson acquitted Brady of other counts of official misconduct, theft by deception and tampering with public records.  Those charges related to allegations that Brady submitted fraudulent time sheets that indicated he was working when he was traveling for personal pleasure or business, and that he used a state vehicle, state gas card and state-issued E-Z Pass on the personal trips.  They also related to allegations that he filed fraudulent firearms qualification certificates. </p>
<p>..Brady, formerly a councilman and mayor in Sparta, was the third highest ranking officer in the Human Services Police, reporting to the chief and the director.  DHS immediately suspended Brady when he was charged by complaint in May 2011. The Human Services Police provide police services at the <strong>developmental centers and psychiatric hospitals operated by the Department of Human Services</strong>.  They also are assigned to protect offices and case workers for the <strong>Division of Youth and Family Services</strong>. </p>
<p>..The state presented testimony and evidence at trial that Brady directed a subordinate employee to conduct background checks on members of his minor league baseball team using the FBI’s National Crime Information Center (NCIC) database, a secure database that is strictly regulated and restricted for police purposes.  He also directed subordinate officers to use the police database and state databases to run a background check on a home health aide he was considering hiring for his mother. </p>

<p>My issue is with really with <strong>njchildsupport-org</strong> They have been withdrawing extra money from my paychecks. I called a bunch of times both times angry people telling me a case manager will call and no-one ever calls. I have wage garnishment that makes me feel like a criminal. I can not get a case manager on the phone to talk to. You can\'t email anyone through the site. In fact I ordered an audit online of my alimony finances and two different ones came with two different finance information which tells me this system is screwed up. This site does not show the payments made to the custodial parent. It just says how much they collect from the non custodial parent. My hard earned money is going to someone and I can\'t figure out to who. When I get more time I want to devote time to this problem in NJ because its a truly terrible experience both online and with the courts and lawyers. I was part on NJ alimony reform but it needs to improve more.

            , the majority of people on Voat do not use Facebook for security reasons. Could you please provide screenshots and/or archives of the comments you've copypasted so people can see what you see? It's also good in case Facebook censors it or the page gets scrubbed. Thanks.

            <p>
             William Aramony (July 27, 1927 – November 11, 2011) was CEO of United Way of America for more than twenty years and helped build the organization into the largest charity in the United States.[1] He retired in 1992
             <strong>
              amid criminal charges of fraud and financial mismanagement
             </strong>
             , for which he was subsequently convicted and sentenced to prison.

             Uhm, I hear there was a scandal with a yacht and underaged girls?

           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             William J. Aramony was born in Jewett City, Connecticut. His parents, Russell &amp; Nazley Farrah Aramony, emigrated to the United States from Lebanon, and he was the youngest of their five children...Aramony married the former Bebe Ann Nojeim, and the union produced three children, William, Susan and Robert.[5] Son Robert was at one time president of Sales Service/America Inc., a for-profit subsidiary of UWA.
            </p>
            <p>
             He was hired as CEO of the national governing body, the United Community Funds and Council of America (UCFCA)[8] in 1970.[4] He began an organizational makeover and the group was renamed, United Way of America (UWA), and moved from New York City to Alexandria, Virginia in 1971. A common stated purpose and standard name (United Way of ...) was established for local affiliates....Next, he
             <strong>
              formed a partnership with the National Football League
             </strong>
             in 1973, whereby "players and coaches made public service announcements about their involvement with United Way chapters"[9] which were broadcast during NFL games at no charge.

             Aramony was awarded the Silver Buffalo Award in 1988 by the National council of the

             Scandal begins - Aramony and his wife, Bebe were separated in 1988.[5] In 1990, there were UWA office rumors about Aramony's liaisons with a teenage girlfriend on vacations in Paris, London and Cairo. An anonymous note on UWA letterhead was sent in late 1990 to UWA's chairman, Edward A. Brennan, who was the chairman of Sears, Roebuck &amp; Company. The letter alleged that the charity was being looted by its president, who was romancing a young woman...

             Putting the Clinton Foundation in Context: Corruption Plain on the Face of It
            </a>

           <blockquote>
            <p>
             Politifact asserted that the Clinton Foundation is “doing the same thing” through a training school for youth in Cartagena, Colombia. Actually, I’m going to give our friends at Politifact “4 Pinocchios” for that, since the Colombia “benefits” from the Clinton Foundation are likely much less than those received by residents of Malawi or Haiti.
            </p>
            <p>
             <strong>
              Colombia is a center for action with Bill Clinton and Frank Giustra and their Clinton-Giustra Enterprise Partnership
             </strong>
             . American Exceptionalists likely think of Colombia as a poor, backward South American country that was the heart of massive drug trafficking in prior decades.
            </p>
            <p>
             I covered the Accesso Training Center in Cartagena in my first article about the Clinton Foundation...
            </p>
            <p>
             ... I’ve never heard of anything quite like it before. It makes the 1980s United Way scandal look like nothing. I started out my career working for the United Way and after meeting jailed, disgraced former United Way of America founder William Aramony and being forced to buy his book by way of keeping my job, I knew there was “something wrong” so I left to do what I considered “real charitable work” actually helping people.
            </p>
            <p>
             The United Way did survive that scandal, which merely consisted of Aramony mis-using a couple of $million to fund his sexual affairs with underage girls, pay for a yacht on the Potomac, etc.

             represented two major arms of the coalition with the Jesuits and Mormons. Religion is one form of control as is employment, service groups and clubs, secret societies, food, water, housing, currency, media, and pizzagate. They created the Racine Interfaith Coalition as the model for religions to unite to push their corrupt and deceitful agenda.

             Scientology (such as Kristin Bauer van Straten et al), OTO (Abramovic et al), and Kabbalah (Ashton Kutcher et al) are also key elements of the coalition along with all arms of the mafia (even the Dixie mafia is in Wisconsin). There are others involved such as new age Christian groups Living Light Community Church and older groups Beth Israel Sinai and many Catholic churches.

            There are further connections with Raniere, Global Technologies and the aerospace agency.  See how deep this thing goes?
