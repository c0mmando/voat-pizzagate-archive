<p>there was a drawing of a person in a crate with people in uniform around the crate looking at it.  i think it was referencing shipping people in crates.  i had it ready to screenshoot but then accidentally unpaused it and i couldn\'t get the cursor to the right spot again. </p>
<p>there was also a pic of a little boy in front of some speakers maybe- some sort of equipment stacked high.  there was a pic of the chuckie cheese bear.  a pic of some people in a church with leis on - Hawaii maybe.  
</p>
<p>the people in the drawings look Asian and sasha lord or majestic ape or whatever her name is said Youth in Asia at the comet party.  she or he or whatever it is was talking about how he had to kill a newborn baby because it cried too much.  he said euthanasia.  but then he said each syllable slowly and purposefully to say Youth in Asia.  there was a pic of kids in a circle lying on the ground with a guitar player.  there was a pic of some guy with an afro, an old lady, a bunny looking into a basket of newborn bunnies, a cat nursing her young, a painting of a little girl with pigtails, a child in a ghost costume, a skipping girl, a retro blond lady smiling, some weird model of a human head in gold, and a cartoon picture of a cloaked and hooded dark force being with no face in dark clouds of red and black. </p>
<p>after these weird images are all flashed a red faced man reads a sick version of twas the night before Christmas to some red faced children with a pig in a cage next to the fire.  it\'s a mockery of twas the night before Christmas.  at the very end of the video he says &quot;february 19th ghost games&quot;.  it seems like he\'s advertising for something called ghost games that will/has taken place on Feb 19th.</p>',

            I'm so disturbed.
           </p>
           <p>
            There really is NO other explanation for the horrendous actions of these people besides evil.  Satan was IN them.  Just like he's IN these baby raper murderers.
           </p>
           <p>
            That is the only explanation.  Human beings with souls do not do things like this.  The souls of these people have been sold to the devil.
           </p>
           <p>
            And why a band would put this stuff in their video is beyond me?

            Look st their faces - the girls all lined up.  You can feel their emotion.  They know that someone is coming to the abuse them more.  One 2nd to last looks ticked off and you can see the hate she feels for whomever is coming.  The 3 in the middle look afraid and one of them looks to be thinking who is it this time.  Then the far left and far right seem to have lost hope.  I'm so mad by all this.  Ive lost 7lbss since this news broke.  I literally cannot eat sometimes.

            yep you're right. i thought i had seen this before. thanks for the info. looks like they might have googled some of these pictures. if someone could reverse image search the torture pics it could possibly debunk this lead.

            This is one of the bands James Alefantis owner of Comet Ping Pong Pizza calls "Family Friendly Entertainment"! The woman who made this is allowed to work with Children at a school! And  Girlscouts, and disabled children.

            Why the pic of a baby dressed as pizza amongst images of rape sodomy torture? These two things should never be in the same sentence much less the same video! The Majority is not DOWN WITH THIS!

             Here's video in Comet ping pong of this majestic ape person.  It's a long video.  It starts off with something about celebrating the birth our lord (who EVER their lord is) on Jan 1st or maybe December 31st- can't remember. Go to 5 minutes to hear part about killing the baby.

             the band is named heavy breathing.  The music video with the torture pics is a heavy breathing video.  Sasha Lord and Amanda Kline are in the band too.  Some of them may be the same person??  Other voaters, am I getting this right?

            Good work! Someone with more skill than me should analyze these videos;
           </p>
           <p>
            Check out the art work for Heavy Breathing on soundcloud;
            <a href="https://soundcloud.com/heavybreathing">
             https://soundcloud.com/heavybreathing
            </a>
            . Also if you check out the youtube videos for the Apes, a group Amanda Keinman also was in you can clearly see from various images that she is indeed Majestic Ape ;https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCZUHQtm89f_0ccFmnZwby8w. The vidoe of the live show in Leeds there is a very clear view of Amanda telling a joke before a show.
           </p>
           <p>
            A group on Heavy Breathings label, electric cowbell records, is called Superhuman Happiness. Check this creepy video out. The band members look like they are about to cause incredible harm to the children. There is nothing happy about them. All their videos they look ghoulish. The only smiles are forced smiles.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZO1AhBTAYNI&amp;list=PL0E38EA13C5F03187&amp;index=6
           </p>
           <p>
            In this video one of the band members smears lipstick on his mouth;
            <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sILpQJEyUxU">
             https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sILpQJEyUxU
            </a>
            and then in this video a little boy in his underwear smears lipstick on his mouth in the same way;
            <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3K8i5HTeCc&amp;index=12&amp;list=PL0E38EA13C5F03187">
             https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3K8i5HTeCc&amp;index=12&amp;list=PL0E38EA13C5F03187
            </a>
            plus image of a kid dragging a dead or unconscious kid in front of a playground dome gym set.  Someone should analyze the symbols in these guys videos. Lots of pedophile imagery and little kids. Lots of stuff in this groups videos.  Small heart in big heart image for "second heart" video.
           </p>
           <p>
            Also pedophile symbol at 5:58?

             when I was a kid, our teachers took us on a night trip to abrush filled field and played "snipe hunt" in the dark, we were running around getting chased and scared by the teachers as well.

            EDIT: saw someone else did the work and posted all the pics.  lest search YOUTUBE and find more of these videos, this can't be the only one.
           </p>
           <p>
            i downloaded the video, went frame by frame in premiere.  confirmed, and there a couple more shots that are creepy as well (well all are creepy)  should i repost or add to this thread.
           </p>
           <p>
            if anyone can do a search to find out more videos that do this frame jump, post the link and i will download and do a report on this

             I agree that the mouth during the "story" reading looks like alefantis'.  It's definitely a man's mouth - you can see stubble

             Maybe it's Amanda sometimes and Alefantis other times?

              there are times, though where you can see Ape/Amanda full body and you can tell she is a female by her hips, body shape.

            Baba also means grandmother in Russian. Baba Yaga in Russian folk tales is a witch who eats children. She is very well-known. You may remember her best from her hut that walks on chicken legs.

            I know it's hard but you have to be patient. Any charges that are brought against any of these people right now would be immediately pardoned by Obama. I'm positive this is why the elite are desperately trying to swing the electoral college, they know their days are numbered. All Trump has to do is appoint a special prosecutor to really investigate and they are screwed. January, I'm hanging on for January.

            Here are all of the images from Neutered Noel. Just noticed the same eye deformation as Soros and Mccann in one of them.

            2nd and 6th pics are from Chinese Falun Gong  dissidents, depict police torture believers.

            2nd pic: police said "too painful to die" 
6th pic: probably waterboarding, police said "this is to save you", "poke through you to death today".

            Wow. Good find. If you're having trouble stopping at a particular frame to capture an image, you can use Freemake Video Downloader to download the video from YT and then just do a frame-by-frame advance in VLC or something. It would also probably be good to have copies of these videos in case they get taken down. I have the one of Majestic Ape's little "roast" spiel saved, among a couple of others.

            I looked at the first one and I cannot stomach looking at the rest, it is beyond my level.  This is really sick crap and somehow should be given to the police.  I just don't know who to trust anymore.

              The first and only picture I looked at I am afraid to say immediately made me think of some pedophile have anal sex with a child.  It was disgusting and I could only look for a few seconds.  It was heart wrenching because of what came to my mind.  I am stomaching a few things because I want to help solve this insane and disgusting crap these morons are doing. It would be good if someone else had seen it.
