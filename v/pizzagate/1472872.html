            This is also a very good answer :
Evil often stems from people who are empty. When one abandons conscience, one also in many respects abandons empathy and love.  Without these elements of our psyche there is no happiness. Without them, there is nothing left but desire and gluttony.
           </p>
           <p>
            Narcissists in particular are prone to use other people as forms of entertainment and fulfillment without concern for their humanity.  They can be vicious in nature, and when taken to the level of psychopathy, they are prone to target and abuse the most helpless of victims in order to generate a feeling of personal power.
           </p>
           <p>
            Add in sexual addiction and aggression and narcissists become predatory in the extreme. Nothing ever truly satisfies them. When they grow tired of the normal, they quickly turn to the abnormal and eventually the criminal.  I would say that pedophilia is a natural progression of the elitist mindset; for children are the easiest and most innocent victim source, not to mention the most aberrant and forbidden, and thus the most desirable for a psychopathic deviant embracing evil impulses.

            The lure of the forbidden. If you watch documentaries about the lives of the superrich, one thing you learn is that they will pay almost anything to be able to have things that ordinary people can't have. Some just want a rare cognac, others want children to abuse (which is not to say you can't have both). The amounts they will pay for these things are absolutely staggering. There was a good documentary on the superrich in London made recently in which a segment was about a woman who sold truffles to them that she couldn't afford to eat herself. Another segment was about superrich interest in rare wines and liquors. The fundamental lesson to be learned from the doco was that (1) to the superrich the entire point of wealth is that it enables you to have things that ordinary people can't have and (2) they will pay spectacular prices to be able to have them. That mentality will apply to sexual perversions as much as anything else.

            Stalin said "give me the boy before the age of 8 and I can make him into anything I want". To condition someone for this type of behavior, you must indoctrinate them when they are young and still developing.
           </p>
           <p>
            Why do you think it is culturally acceptable in other countries? Because its learned behavior passed down.

            We already know full well that psychopaths are attracted to power positions. So would it be a stretch to say that occasionally psychopaths do make it to these high power positions and if enough psychopaths made it to the highest power positions that they could then get their circle of psychopath buddies into similar positions? This is what they say happened with papa bush and people involved in franklin/contra scandal.

            Get it?  Once you have submitted to compromising yourself (photos are taken for proof as well as other proof exists - possibly the DNA sperm on the "hankerchiefs" which are the "map" to identify you legally), you get put in positions, get paid a lot and are on the inside.  You just have to crush your soul and those of others to get that.  Once in, you can never regain what you've lost.  Some develop a taste for it probably.   There is a real reason why Satanism is involved - it steps in as a substitute for a spiritual system and brings some order (ritual) to the armeggedon of the soul.  It gives meaning, no matter how perverted or ridiculous.
           </p>
           <p>
            We all know that simple axiom that psychopaths will relentlessly rulthlessly pursue whatever they want regardless of the consequences, but we somehow forget day to day that these people running things are the psychopaths of our society attracted to hubs of personal gain and dominance.  When your personality is that perverted, torturing innocence is just part of the lay of the land.  I also think some of them revert to a juvenile state and try to pretend they are kids again during some of the "courtship" of kids, but babies doesn't fit into that.

            White sex slave trade would be huge. From what I've heard, especially in Israel, Saudi Arabia, and the UAE.

            There is no settling answer to this.
I'll get flak for this, but, I cannot yet share what I know/believe to be said answer - as I'm not yet sure of the authenticity and accuracy.

            Nothing is as it seems, the depravity knows no bounds.
(I'm not a shill, the why is just as morbid and kryptic as I'm being with this post, so far as I can tell)

             I will be waiting to hear. I have been researching it a long time, and know a lot, but still really not why. Being told to look up psychology of pedophilia is a slap in the face.

            This is far more complicated than a single post on here can explain.  Many are abused as children themselves.  It's a sexual deviancy where they are attracted to a certain age and not adults.  I don't think you really want to know the details of what they do but many children who are babies die from this type of abuse.  Google psychology of pedophelioa if you want to learn about it.
