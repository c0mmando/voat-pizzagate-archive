This is the first time UK nationals have made up the majority of cases identifying children and adults who are &quot;at the mercy&quot; of slave drivers and traffickers.  The reason?  It comes partly down to fears of children being exploited in a drug distribution model known as &quot;county lines,&quot; where city gangs branch out into county and coastal towns to sell heroin and crack.  In 2017 the number was up 35% from 2016 and almost tripled since 2013.</p>
<p>There were hundreds of reports of sexual exploitation, domestic servitude and three cases of organ harvesting.  116 nationalities reported, and the largerst group was UK citiizens.  
</p>
<p>The National Referral Mechanism (NRM) is a framework for identifying victims of human trafficking and modern slavery, but not all individuals who are referred are ultimately assessed to be modern slavery victims.  NRM\'s director, Will Kerr, stated:  
</p>
<p>&quot;It is our assessment that the increase we are seeing here is driven by an increased awareness and greater reporting of modern slavery and that is to be welcomed.&quot;  (Really????  Maybe it\'s because this is becoming the norm, and governments turn their backs on it because of the elites and law enforcements agencies.  We are only hearing about the tip of the iceberg)!  Kerr further states, &quot;However, it also adds further evidence to our view that the figures almost certainly represent an underestimate of the true scale of slavery and trafficking in the UK.&quot;  (Thank you).  Kerr warned authorities that they are dealing with an &quot;evolving threat&quot; as criminals go into &quot;online spaces&quot; to enable the crime.  He said, &quot;We are also seeing increasing crossovers between slavery and organized immigration crime outside the UK.  Often the same criminal networks are involved in transportation, and migrants themselves are vulnerable to labor and sexual exploitation during their journeys and after.  Particularly concerning to us is the rise in young people being exploited for sexual purposes or drug trafficking.  The number of drugs using \'county lines\' drugs distribution has risen amid increasing turf wars and a crackdown by inner city police who can identify gang members.&quot;</p>
<p>Devon and Cornwall Chief Constable Shaun Sawyer, the national policing lead for modern slavery, stated:</p>
<p>&quot;It means police are identifying more victims of modern slavery than ever before, ensuring they get the support they need and exploitation is stopped.&quot;  He goes on to say, &quot;Stealing years from someone\'s life, abusing them to believing they are subhuman, denying them employment opportunities, not enabling them to have healthcare, demeaning and destroying ther education...it\'s pretty high for me.&quot;

<p>I researched back a few years to 2012, and of course no big surprise, nothing has changed.  &quot;Human Trafficking to UK Rising.&quot;  This time it\'s blamed on trafficking gangs in China, Vietnam, Nigeria and eastern Europe.  (Well, a large percentage of these &quot;gangs&quot; have since migrated to the UK)  Anyway, the UK government said in 2012 that better coordination between its departments and with authorities abroad was &quot;key.&quot;  Also in 2012, there were an estimated 92 organized crime groups in the UK with known involvement in human trafficking.  
</p>
<p>Dr. Aiden McQuade, then director of Anti-Slavery International, stated, &quot;We must face up to the fact&quot; that the problem was worsening &quot;because of fundamental policy failures.&quot;  He said the government viewed the problem &quot;through the lens of immigration,&quot; and had allowed rights for migrant workers to slip from &quot;best practice.&quot;  (smart man, but nobody listened).

<p>There has also been a claim from a mother in Seattle that &quot;child sex trafficking is as easy as ordering a pizza&quot; according to a 2017 article.  A mother said said it when she found out about her daughter being sold as a sex slave for 108 days.<br />

<p>Sex trafficiking of children is an international epidemic, the fastest growing business of organized crime, and the third largest criminal enterprise in the world.

            The UK government-military-media complex run the drugs and sex slave trade. Why do you think they call it "modern" slavery? They are selling its acceptance like Tony Blair sold Labour's acceptance by renaming his party New Labour. Get it yet? Modern = New; Slavery = Labour.
           </p>
           <p>
            They have people who run all the little gangs and drug dealers too - they're called the police.

             Also in Lockstep with their NWO.  New World Order.  New is the Key Hint I believe.  They are making everything Old, New Again.  It's always been there but they are doing a Switcheroo.  Yes, what's really modern about it?  They have improved upon it.  Much more sleek and efficient.  Not like the Old Model.  They are using a PR Campaign on us of sorts.  Sickening.

            The child trafficking and drug trafficking connections are often through pakistanis. I know that pakistani organized crime is responsible for both through out asia. it issuspected that the British government has been aiding them.  There are too many articles on this for me to count, I do know that the rotterham sex ring is connected to a pakistan sex ring from 2015.
           </p>
           <p>
            I will do some more digging and give you the dox and sources for this later. This is not a pleasant rabbit hole, and it does tie into terrorism.

              You are not familiar with this topic are you? The pakistani sex traffickers ARE connected to the UK government, and the US government.
             </p>
             <p>
              There are connections via rotterham, FIFA, And the Obama administration. One of the uglier things that stood out was that these pakistani connections were investigated by Orbis Business Intelligence over FIFA bribes. Orbis business intelligence is owned by Christopher Steele, the man behind the piss dossier.
             </p>
             <p>
              Its a very deep rabbit hole. It appears that pakistani organized crime is heavily involved in drug trafficking, bribery in the middle east, and human trafficking. They expanded greatly during the war on terror, because apparently they got a huge infusion of cash from western governments.

               Well, you're right. I'm not familiar with this topic because I haven't been aware of the connections you are making.  Another rabbit hole to go down.

               Would you have some links? Thank you. I always wondered what the connection might be of the British elites and the Pakistani child trafficking gangs.

                It will take a bit. Remind me if you don't hear from me in a few days. This is not a rabbit hole, it is a rabbit warren.

                To give you an idea about how bad it is over there, this is a recent article written in January over an incident, that names pizzagate.

                This was not the one i was looking for. There was an incident from a few years ago, where they not only were making child pornography, but they were also black mailing the kids with the tapes. That gang was connected to rottherham AND people in the rotterham city government.
