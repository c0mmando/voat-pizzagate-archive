            Research who founded bitcoin in Hollywood? What is he accused/known for? Also there are leaks happening of E. Schmidt of Google and "young models"

           <p>
            Also AnonScan has just tweeted the beginning of the Biden takedown &amp; now an actual recording of threats to Trump with a Buzzfeed link. Something is going down.

             Was this stuff from AnonScan pretty much verified to be true? Has the recording with Trump been released? Shit if that is out it explains why Trump has been relenting to the globalists. What the hell is happening.

            Yes, modeling and what's going on is a huge lead. There was a sensationalize case of a model that jumped out a high rise apartment committing suicide a few years back. I was suspicious and started digging around. Now here's this "top model" and yet I found her name on this really scummy beauty pageant  DATING site! Yeah, men could connect with the girls entered in this pageant and date them? I was like, WTH is this model doing entering a two-bit beauty pageant? It made no sense. The thing was that that the entire thing was scrubbed from the internet within hours. When I went to find it again, gone!
           </p>
           <p>
            I did more digging and found out that this model who appeared on every cover of every major fashion magazine in the world was BROKE! The apartment was being paid for by her agency and she was begging everyone for money and starving. She was also big on the internet and telling everyone on social media that she was "bad", "evil", and a "witch". Put the whole thing together and you have someone that is basically being trafficked.

             Was this the Russian teen model? I remember that case a while back as it was so odd. They said she was super depressed and took her life and there was not much to be found. I knew there was more too. Modelling agencies for years sold the girls to dates with wealthy men. They just had to call the agency booker and arrange it. The agencies also made sure the girls were constantly in debt. So fucking sad.

              Don't think it was Russia per se. It was from some country where girls were noted for beauty by how long they grew their hair. When she was discovered, her hair reached her knees. Did a search. It was Rushlana Korshunova.

              </a>
              Strange. Just found another article that says her hair was cut off before she jumped ... ???? That was never mentioned. Isn't that sort of a big thing?
              <a href="http://www.pravdareport.com/society/stories/22-09-2009/109425-korshunova-0/">

              They also don't mention that she kept saying she was a witch and evil.Okay, this is the one that mentions her writing the witch stuff.

               Yes that is the same girl. Really strange. Did the cops ever find her hair in the apartment? Probably not. I think she was murdered. So sad. I wonder who the private island creep was. Rose of the World is likely an Illuminati spin off of some sort.

                In other words, someone wanted to destroy her. I think it was the Rose of the World that might have had that site up where men could bid for dates with the "contestants." Methinks the journalists (ha! since when are there journalists searching for the truth?) never even bothered doing a story on this. Note her friends said she was working all the time. Somebody's lying. Either she wasn't working or she was. I think a lot of people are lying. And lookie here! I followed up on the billionaire on the island clue and what do you know? Jeffrey Epstein's name pops up? This is actually a great link. I agree that it had to do with human trafficking. I know her name was down there as a "contestant" and men were bidding on dating her.

                 Exactly. When I copied the part about the wealthy guy with a private island Jeffrey Epstein is immediately who I thought of. Sure enough... she was likely on that shitty island and saw a lot of shit happen. She was murdered in broad daylight in that manner to send a message to the other girls to keep their mouth shut. The hair was taken as a sick souvenir. Likely someone in the Epstein circle if not directly related to him. Sick bastard. The police not investigating and ruling it a suicide tells u right there she was murked. All the articles are saying different things, except the truth but if u read between the lines it's so clear to see.

                  Totally agree. They had no intention of finding out the truth. It's what billionaire pervs can do. No doubt it was a souvenir. Probably tied it to that dentist chair. Or there could have been someone jealous of her ... someone like The Cannibal Queen. She probably gets off on collecting those types of souvenirs. The whole thing gets me ill. She was a nice girl and ran into these sickos. Hopefully, these bastards will get what they deserve and end up in jail.

                   This story is really getting to me. There is so much speculation about other things on different sites under the comments sections. People are saying it was the Russian Mafia because in Russia that's how they kill people throwing them off balconies. However, "friends" say she told them about a lawsuit and she was suing someone. More people say yes she was suing her agent because they were taking huge portions of her earnings, as much as $500k. I don't see an agency killing their money machine, the agent hiring someone, I don't know... but cutting off her hair before death, NO.  The hair cutting is key. It is only mentioned by the middle eastern man who was the door security who seems credible in quotes because he mentioned no one even wanted to interview him, no one talked to him except the media and he saw her come and go right before her death. He saw her hair cut off instantly. Get this though: under the comments on a blog a friend close to her looking for justice says she was pregnant and had complained of stomach trouble and pains. Imagine IF she was indeed pregnant by the wealthy illuminati asshole and she wanted the baby and he demanded an abortion. This is plausible but, to me, it's either that or, most likely, she had ALOT of dirt on Epstein. He didn't want another lawsuit. Perhaps she witnessed a sacrifice or something sinister. Also, there was another foreign model connected to the Rose of the World who was murdered. This is fucked. I also think 'they' put a lot of disinformation out there about her, like her so called blog and what she wrote. This suicide murder reeks of a silence technique to keep the girls quiet. This is maddening...

                    Something came back to me about this story ... there was something occult going on. I found this article from Australia saying she'd joined a cult:
                    <a href="http://www.news.com.au/entertainment/celebrity-life/supermodel-ruslana-korshunova-had-joined-dehumanising-cult-before-jumping-to-death-author-claims/news-story/b22717d480ddcb56c32cefae0626eece">
                     http://www.news.com.au/entertainment/celebrity-life/supermodel-ruslana-korshunova-had-joined-dehumanising-cult-before-jumping-to-death-author-claims/news-story/b22717d480ddcb56c32cefae0626eece
                    </a>
                    but that wouldn't begin to describe what was going on. What I remembered was that there was a "fashion" spread in Paris Vogue (Anna Wintour was responsible). It was roundly criticized since it really was about devil worshipping. But the really disturbing thing is that the model they selected to be in the spread, was a Ruslana lookalike. They put extensions in her hair to make her resemble her even more. Further, the model was posed to look as if she'd fallen and was dead on the ground. She was even holding the tarot Death card. I don't know if people are aware, but dressing someone in someone else's image is powerful black magick. It's a step further than the voodoo doll. In having this other model mimic Ruslana in this death "fallen" pose, Ruslana was hexed. Whether Ruslana was involved in witchcraft, or was made part of it, I don't know, but there it is. I knew there was something else to this. It's why it was so weird and got my attention when it happened. Here's the spread:

                    I totally appreciate your frustration. This story is so screwed up with so many missing pieces that it's ridiculous. The disinfo makes it more so. As for the doorman/security, yeah, no ... you can't trust him either. I say this because if she was involved in human trafficking and put up in this apartment, the doormen usually work for the organizations and are used to spy and keep tabs on the girls and report back where they go, who they see, etc., etc. We don't even know for sure if she made those remarks on social media. However, it is a coincidence that a witch's power was thought to be her hair. It was one reason why it was cut. That life coach sounds suspicious also. Was he someone planted in her life? Did she reveal secrets to him? And all her money was given to her mother? We don't know that either. She might have just said that. I mean, what would she say if she was trying to borrow money? She'd have to say she didn't have any because she was sending it home. The same with all those assignments. Were they actually "dates" with these men that bought her time? Did she say she was working as a cover, or was she actually working? And no one named the billionaire with the island she was seeing? I mean, if she was dating Kanye, they'd certainly blast his name all over the place, but they don't even mention the guy's name? Why if it's the truth? So many questions, and no answers. Would love a actual investigative journalist to get involved in that story, but there are none out there so why am I even wasting my breath.

                     Hi quantokitty yes u are correct about the door security watching and hired by the wrong people. I remember a story of a Freemason who hired the door guy at a certain high end apartment in NY with the master keys and they planted evidence in certain people's homes without their knowledge. The reason I think this particular security guy was truthful in his observations and may be different is because this girl was an actual model in major magazines and big name contracts I've seen some of the ads and runway stuff so she definitely was more of a working model than just a human trafficking sex slave, however, I think the agencies have a major hand in sending the girls out on dates with big money men and celebrities. I don't believe the social media stuff it could easily have been planted and faked without her knowledge. Sooo many unanswered questions. Someone said something about her mother absolutely does not believe she suicided herself and was going to file some suit against the police, again this is hearsay though. The island billionaire is so telling and when I read Prince Andrew and Virginia the underage girl he was having sex with, it said it was a fucking orgy with 11 or 12 people participating!! That in itself tells me that if ruslana was on that shitty island she would be privy to this kind of stuff and Epstein probably is careful because of the press with Virginia that he doesn't want loose ends with info floating around. Your other post about vogue magazine is chilling, so blatant with the satanic shit and yes the model is almost identical to ruslana. I would not even be surprised if they used ruslanas hair to make a hair piece for ceremonies to be worn by someone or even the possibility of that model wearing her hair piece in the shoot, again, that is speculation but plausible considering how they operate. There were rumours about her being into witchcraft etc and that she had all kinds of books and her apartment was full of that stuff but her friends said her apartment was filled with stuffed animals and trinkets. Why are they making her out to be some satanic high priestess? This case reeks and the chiefs of police around the country are comprimised its blatantly obvious and alarming. Thanks for ur responses.

            I dont know how to archive. I am really ignorant with technology, and I dont want to try and archive something if it even might be illegal. I have heard enough horror stories to be really leery. Anyways how do you archive something? Sorry if I sound like a complete idiot.

            Back in my SEO days we used to lookup what websites were linking to our competitors. I wonder if a reverse lookup for buzzfeed or their facebook page would throw up any interesting results. I no longer have access to the tools to do this.
           </p>
           <p>
            These guys must have a way to find each other, something that links them without needing a darknet list etc.

             I think you are close to something. Speaking of facebook, do you remember those twitter accounts that pizzagate investigators busted, and they got in trouble for it? I wonder if they use that kind of crap.

              I know who did that @ Eclipse_OW now defunct, never actually involved in PG itself but was active when all this was breaking, but I have a lead back into them if needed. Afaik they actually analysed the content on those accounts, good old fashioned number crunching Eclipse also only broke half of his 'stash'  he was left with 20k accounts that were all 100% CP and another 20k that he was not sure enough to dump given the expected repercussions.  He was half right at least

            Great find, excellent sleuthing!  However this appears to be the kind of lead that only someone with significant technical experience and nous in covering one's tracks should pursue.

             man I would not touch it now that other investigators here have said to have found child porn on these sites and the authorities have been contacted. I hope they actually shut this shit down asap.

             do NOT go to those sites! It was reported to the authorities already. Let them take care of it. There is nothing more we can do. I would suggest reporting to the FBI as well if you have seen anything so that they know you did not intentionally try to see anything.

              If it is this bad, I would suggest mods put up some heavy duty signing of this being extremely dangerous to investigate and out of our hands. I would suggest others report to the FBI as well. This sounds like a real case now.

            <p>
             Click on their instagram and it will take you to BUZZFEED'S instagram. Connection? Or just another front to make the recipe website appear more legit. It bring big questions considering buzzfeeds absolute opposition to Trump. It would not surprise me if Buzzfeed is actively participating in this behavior. One of their other other social media links takes you to the food network. Not surprising considering hollywoods connection to pedophilia.

            It just looks like the owner of this website put whatever social media accounts at the bottom of their page (Food Network, Twitter Food, Everyday Food, Food.com, Buzzfeed Food). There probably is no connection between this website and those social media accounts. Maybe I'm wrong?
           </p>
           <p>
            What I found interesting was on "Salad Recipes" profile on The Recipe Club – they have 69 posts but I can only see 10 of them. Even if there are 69, still adds to the weirdness of everything, even if coincidental.

            Please ping me if evidence is found the Buzzfeed connection turns out to be legit, and I will give this a "New Evidence" flair. Due to that possibility, I am giving this a "Potential Lead" flair

             it looks like to me they just have buzzfeed and other social media links to look more authentic but it is absolutely a fake site. I'm still  investigating but their new site is
             <a href="https://teenmodels4bitcoin.com">
              https://teenmodels4bitcoin.com
             </a>

             It doesn't feel like a honeypot to me, but there does seem to be a lot of info here, usernames and comments at least.

              Thanks for sharing that, and the risk warning. If you could add some screenshots showing the use of food code and any report to authorities of any CP actually found, in a comment documenting the connection of the two, that would be helpful. And, you could make a separate post about your findings with a headline that would be more searchable, for posterity and the purposes of Tweeting this out. If you feel comfortable doing so.

               what are the rules on posting the owners info? name, birthday, email address(es), phone, address, and several of his passwords. i was actually able to login to his new site but unfortunately he had two factor auth enabled so i couldn't get any further than that.
              </p>
              <p>
               all of his info except address and passwords he actually has listed on public forums unrelated to any of his sites.
              </p>
              <p>
               i'll get some screenshots prepared and as far proving the use of food as code, i haven't seen anything directly proving that, but i can prove that he has a network of underage teen model sites that all route to therecipe.club when logging in, as well as the prices being the same as the prices on his new site, as well as the fact that he is the owner of the recipe site.

                You are fine with publishing anything publicly available (not necessarily posted by him) as long as it's not about someone who is a Voat user. I would put it in an image and link to it, though, so it doesn't pop up in search engines and give away the farm.

              This might sound dumb, but has anybody thought of coming up with guidelines or a set of protocols on how to deal with data that comes in? How this place will handle it, and what should be done, and what channels the info will go through? I posted this info here because I honestly was not sure what to think at first.

              Think of a virtual machine aa a terminal computer you would work on at work (in most cases, locked down machines). Only your computer is the server the terminals connect to.
             </p>
             <p>
              It just opens another window on your computer (the teeminal) and you get to determine the permissions.

              It will get this more exposure and people seeing this is how they operate.

             stratfor, dyncorp, and those types genuinely scare me. they are apart of the secret armies of these NWO types. the stories that are told about their reach, methods, and the shit they have pulled is really bad.

              Just goes to show how sneaky these people really are. If it wasn't for pizzagate, I don't think a connection like this would have ever been found.

            Someone  Comments: " Those websites should not have been posted here. That is the kind of stuff that shut down pizzagate investigation from reddit."    It sounds like a site that has teen models and they use food and desserts to describe them?  At least that is my impression and then you pay with bitcoin.   Yuck.  This  sounds like "Jail Bait" Girls To Order.  Really bad and disgusting.

             Yeah, It would not hurt to call them.  Better safe than sorry?  It sure sounds scummy.  Buying girls with something that leaves no tracks?  Double bad.

               Any local law enforcement officers you know and trust to ask advice re who to contact? Alphabet agencies probably run this op.
