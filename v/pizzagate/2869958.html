<p>Blind Items Revealed #8 - Anniversary Month</p>
<p>January 9, 2018  Today\'s Blind Items - P Is For Pervert</p>
<p>Ahh, I miss <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2017/12/29/entertainment/sue-grafton-obit/index.html">Sue Grafton</a> already, so why not pay a little tribute to her in the headline.</p>
<p>This behind the scenes power in Hollywood has been a serial molester of young boys for the past couple decades.  Let\'s call him &quot;P&quot;.</p>
<p>For the past few decades, this man has turned one client into dozens of some of the most powerful players in Hollywood. Back when he first started, this man, who we will call P, was not very shy about the way he molested tweens and teens. In fact, one of his A+ list clients at the time used to join in these sick events. That A+ list client, we will call M. If there is anyone who has seemingly got away with long term child molesting it is M. All of you know M. Most of you have probably read about his abuse of tweens and teens and children and adults. Most of you have read about his love of child porn. Most of you have read rumors of him assaulting people on and off sets.</p>
<p>With the wave of publicity that is looking for these horrible people, both M and P have gone underground. What they used to do fairly openly relatively speaking, they now do mainly through online webcams.</p>
<p>Several decades ago, when P was first starting out, he had a very public confrontation with one of his victims. It was in the parking lot outside where a very hit network sitcom was shot. Members of the cast and crew witnessed the interaction. It was a member of that cast that introduced P to his victim.</p>
<p>Another of P\'s victims was 12 years old at the time. P lured him back to his apartment. Once there, he plied him with pot and booze and made him watch porn before molesting him.</p>
<p>It is time for P to be exposed. It is time for others to step forward and pass along their stories. If you don\'t want to send them to me, then send them to that group that makes films exposing these awful people.</p>
<p><strong>P - Jeff Ballard</strong></p>

           already, so why not pay a little tribute to her in the headline.

          <p>
           This behind the scenes power in Hollywood has been a serial molester of young boys for the past couple decades.  Let's call him "P".
          </p>
          <p>
           For the past few decades, this man has turned one client into dozens of some of the most powerful players in Hollywood.

          </p>
          <p>
           With the wave of publicity that is looking for these horrible people, both M and P have gone underground. What they used to do fairly openly relatively speaking, they now do mainly through online webcams.

            I lived in LA several years ago, and at the time, my older roommate (in her 50s) told me how she went to visit her friend who is a private nurse to celebrities and went to Denise Richards’ house and hung out with them. This was shortly after she had the public divorce from Charlie. And my roommate told me that Charlie paid her a shit ton of money to keep quiet about his child porn addiction after she discovered it and divorced him over it. She also got custody of their kids I think because of her knowledge of it. I was shocked at the time but totally forgot about it until now.
           </p>
           <p>
            AND, I just realized, his brother, Emilio Estevez was in all the Mighty Ducks movies and the lead kid in that was Brock Pierce, member of that convicted pedo Hollywood group, DEN. There should be investigation on all their movies and cast members now that I think about it...

            I have been waiting for C Thomas Howell to come out with a story bc I have always thought there had to be something there. He went from the top of the acting world to way below where he belonged. He was and is a great actor- so what happened? Something had to happen and I hope he comes forward eventually.
