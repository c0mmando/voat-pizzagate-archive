            What sticks out most, to me, is the partisan attitude people have about this.  I wish we could remove the politics and realize that this is far bigger and that politics only exist as theater.  In the end, it is the same people who are supplying these children, who bring us fractional reserve banking, drug trafficking, gun running, religion, legalese and other horrors.  What they have done is masterful.  Children are being stolen, raped, tortured, killed and EATEN and we are discussing Milo.   F&amp;^K Milo and everyone else, who is not a child victim.  None of these things matter.  We need to focus on unity for these kids.  I was a kid, Staunch liberals do not hate kids, as a rule.  Alt-Right voters do not want kids hurt.  The people who are supposed to represent our ideals are the ones who want to harm kids.  Why support them?

             I agree. I'm tired of seeing thing portrayed as left vs right thing, the only reason for that is because it was Hillarys freaking campaign manager who got pegged first and is obviously going to be a deserved "scapegoat" while they try to cover up the rest before it gets worse. That doesn't mean this is a thing to "get the left" or liberals or what the **** ever, it just means we have a screwed up set of people in power with all sorts of affiliations with too much to cover up and that's just not right.
            </p>
            <p>
             I knew this could lead to something way beyond what it seems and it's enough to make you feel like you've lost your mind, so that just tells me that we're either very much on to something or god-help us there's an even crazier explanation. Pedophilia amongst higher-ups has always unfortunately been a thing, why? I don't ******* know but power does the corrupting-thing and then there's no going back, so it does make sense that they're scrambling now.
            </p>
            <p>
             We have to handle this carefully and not do anything drastic, they already proved that with the "shooter who shot the PC tower" incident, we just really need to research and archive and keep going.
            </p>
            <p>
             I know I'm new but I've been archiving everything too, I just don't feel informed enough (it's only been a few weeks) to delve into research on my own but once I do I'll let you all know.

            4chan had been all but unusable for weeks.  Tons of threads would be locked after 8-10 posts and then vanish.  You couldn't even refresh page without everything interesting disappearing to be replaced with 10s of threads on benefits of interracial breeding, anti-trump, and what kinds of pets make the best assassins.  Just garbage.

            I too browse 4chan occasionally hoping to find a supposed insider again.  Well last night there was a new first time insider, again supposedly.  I didn't follow the thread completely as I dropped off while it was still in progress, but it is supicious that this happened now
           </p>
           <p>
            Also, i Just checked 4chan and they have an announcement that they are recovering from a site issue.

            First of all, we want to know what is going on there - no apologies, don't care if we love or hate it.  4chan represents the last outpost of the totally free, even heinously free, internet wild west.  It is an integral part of internet cultural heritage.

            This is not new. 4chan outright banned GamerGate, why did you think they would allow pizzagate ? They've been shilled for a long time, now. Go on 8chan, at this point everyone has moved to it.

             8 chan.net doesn't have the volume of 4 chan but it is Schillens free...4 chan has had hella schills but higher volume of woke folks...
Remember 2 Sundays ago watching the workdcorpo video thread in real time...exciting stuff but the threads were being removed every ten minutes...I gues archiving is the answer (although i don't know how to do that). It seems the Schills only show up around major events like the Milo takedown

              8chan is not shill-free. See the pinned thread on /pol/. But it has enough volume for discussions to happen without being flooded easily by shills (look how many pizzagate threads there are).

              Why is 8 chan not disgussing?  I am not gonna ask but v. Little mention.  New thread suggests appropriate topics and behavior for anyone migrating...none of which include popular threads.

               Well, when Reddit shut down pizzagate...there was a sticky for a while telling folks to migrate to VOAT...not sure if that would work for 8 chan...also likely to bring Schills over.  Lots of 8 chan anons look down on 'half chan' also

            I think this might be an experiment for the effectiveness of this technique. Literally flood /pol/ so much that nothing can really be said.
           </p>
           <p>
            We grew up on psyops and shitposting so there are only two options to mitigate /pol/ and our kind of community.
           </p>
           <p>
            1) Convince us with a valid argument
           </p>
           <p>
            2) Prevent us from talking but don't shut /pol/ down or we'll leak and maybe make a new /pol/ under our own leadership.
           </p>
           <p>
            I'm concerned that shills will see that this is effective and start doing it whenever there is a happening.

            They do this with everything, they infiltrate and buy whatever platform is a threat. They can then control the narrative. Milo they could not control so look what happened. I am seeing them take over meetup to organize resistance against trump and  I am in a heavily republican area. We need to brainstorm next steps. To be successful a business needs a  business plan. This is not a business but without a plan with out a vision this will go nowhere.  For this investigation to gain traction we are going to need to go beyond simple investigation. We need a plan, a mission statement, spokespeople, a marketing plan, fund raising, I don't know what else. We need facts, we need to raise awareness, we need prosecutors, judges need to be under scrutiny, protests laws need to be passed, security to protect witnesses from getting assasinated (this is a big one) Right now the pedofile network are more organized and well funded. So far all we have is voat and 4chan and some amazing investigators a few reporters. I don't pretend to know anything about this, but maybe a brainstorming session needs to be called. And be very paranoid and watchful, this site is infiltrated and they are going to try to create chaos and discord. Thank goodness kek is god of chaos!

            You're scared with good reason. This is the ultimate scandal, the perfect storm that may bring down our whole system and wreak havoc through our civilization if improperly handled. You're not even authorized to be aware of what's going on, the simple fact that you are makes you a potential threat, an enemy for people whom you never met but inadvertently became aware of their actions.
    These people would exterminate you without hesitation to cover their child rape circus. Why do you think there is a push for censorship? You have to be silenced. There can't be a risk for these things to be exposed.

              Organization is a bad idea. An organized movement would be infiltrated and corrupted. All of this information has been revealed and exposed in a decentralized manner, which is why it has been so effective. Everyone knows what they need to do. We don't need a leader. The revolution will not be televised.

              <p>
               there has to happen something , just sitting behind your pcscreen, "finding" "leads" &amp; "evidence"  doing NOTHING will play directly in their cards :
keep you nice &amp; quit , while they control the narritive (msm) 
i was just talking about dates &amp; times , this pedo thing is happening everywhere not only in usa , so thats far from organized movement , more
the ppl who stand up ( from behind their pcscreens) &amp; demand real change. Infiltration &amp; corruption happens when you work in the shadows &amp; bringing it to the streets
is the exact opposite of that !

                You mention people "sitting behind their PC screens" as if they're not making a difference. If you think it would be more effective to stand on corners holding signs, or rioting like the left is currently doing, have at it. But it looks like what is happening right now is far more effective. The information is finding its way to people who can bring these people to justice (white hats in law enforcement, FBI, etc.). And again, this is so effective because it is decentralized, and thus hard to infiltrate and misguide.

                 in the msm pizzagate is as dead as a dodo.
it only "lives" online. it feels more like a way of conditioning ppl into the possibility of pedogate in order to control them.
society is all about control. thats what the eilte wants. control/power . thats what pedophelia is all about : power. thats the reason why allot of ppl with "power" positions 
are : priests,teachers,lawyers,judges,kings,queens,policemen,etc... 
im saying the NEXT  step after this "digging" is massive protests. so EVERYONE  is aware WITHOUT  the control &amp; help from MSM.
if we do our job right the pizzarelated subverses will be obsolete.
and if someone "finds" some abuse case that has allready happened behind his pc screen , whats the progress in that ? 
think about the next step , dont fear corruption or infiltration , specially when you have nothing to hide &amp; small detail , when your not ALONE.
but i must say that i get allot of the same reactions : no protests , not working together with ppl from other countries , just stick at home &amp; pc. fucking insane.

                  TPTB are running scared because of what is happening online. It's clear that people in the system who can make a difference are monitoring Reddit, Voat, 4chan. Without the investigative research being done online, no one would be talking about the possibility of these guys going to jail. It's not over yet. One thing you can be sure of, they would love for us to go out and protest, to form an organized movement that they can control through deceit and bribery of its leaders. Occupy Wall Street and the Tea Party are good examples. I know it would be more bad ass to paint our faces and storm the castle like Brave Heart, but that will accomplish absolutely nothing. Standing in front of a court house shouting "Arrest the Pedo's! Arrest the Pedo's!" will accomplish nothing. Providing well documented evidence of all this sick and twisted corruption to people inside and outside of the system will ultimately do the job.

                   can you please stop with terms like "leaders" &amp; shit ? have you in you "digging" read about the white march in belgium where ppl WITHOUT A LEADER 
came TOGETHER &amp; started marching DEMANDING  JUSTICE . im talking about this on a worldwide scale. when ppl or slaves are not doing their thing anymore
(being a slave) the elite has a problem. who is going to listen to their msm ? who is going to help them gain control when most of policeforces starting to see
that they are also slaves &amp; victims of the powerlust from the elite. you're right i never said stop looking for "evidence" &amp; "leads" but this alone is NOT  enough.
and those ppl you mentioned reddit,voat,4chan , are probbably pedos infested places anyway , what better cloak of camouflage then to pose as a fighter of pedocrime ?
the elite likes control so much they will always be on both sides. thats why we must do something together with the ppl from the world.

                     The White March
On October 20 about 300,000 people (estimates range from 275,000 to 325,000, around 3% of Belgium's population)[1][2] marched through Brussels. Many Belgians who lived outside Brussels came to the city to take part in the march. This demonstration, called the "The White March", was the largest one Brussels had ever seen. Everyone was carrying something white: a balloon, a cloak, etc.; some had painted their face white. White was meant symbolically, as the color of hope. This symbolism had grown after Queen Fabiola wore white at the funeral of her husband. During the march, the fire brigade turned their hoses on the Federal Parliament buildings to symbolically cleanse it. With the demonstration, the Belgian public opinion wanted to indicate something had to change in Belgium and that the justice system and the police had to show more attention to children.

                     im talking something about this on a worldwide scale . i dont know how it will work out , i do know
that you will eliminate the chance of the event being called "fakenews" , the problem of awareness , all the people will find common ground
and come together for a common goal ( something the elite offcourse dont want , thats why we're so divided in the world today )

                     at the time the official narrative was that there were no networks !!! 
so only a few were arrested. now with pizzagate its very clear that there are networks !!!
u begin to see my motivation ?

                      Take a look at what happened in S. KOREA last month. 1 m+ spontaneously in the streets for about a month.  This ousted the president because everyone found out she was in a satanic occult (S Korea is very xtian).  Now the head of Samsung in prison...both sides of this argument are right.  I believe there will be a tipping point in a major city (NY/DC/LA) where people start street protesting like in Seoul.  The problem is these cities largely believe the MSM.  How can we redpill large number of folks in these cities...idk, but the internet is what we have now as well as a few high profile voices (hopefully Trump is one)...they have MSM, CIA, and assassins willing to take out high profile voices. We have to keep digging and pushing on line.

                       yes i "know" about s korea , but could not verify the occultism only corruption , samsung same haven't found occultism
i never said stop with "digging" but we must i think , think about the next step. in the end this is really a control thing ,
everybody stays nice &amp; quite behind his/hers pc screen , which is only good for the ones in power ( politicians / elite / ... )
for there is a "need" to get "justice" done , in a controlled matter , by "their" hands &amp; rules , which will result in prisontime ( if lucky)
&amp; the ppl will pay for this , its insane . the main focus is control but that will not bring true justice &amp; true change.
i will check those last two videos , thanks

                         well in belgium ppl have experienced pizzagate mini , so they have seen the effect of protesting , several ppl got
arrested but because of the denial of networks &amp; the elite still in charge behind the scene allot did'nt get arrested.
thats why there must be an global effort to stop this everywhere , every child is innocent . 
you need more then just the far left to believe , like i said before , we need the rest of the world , this affects humanity globaly.
btw the link you provided , no s korea "evidence" of satanism , one video was hillarywon video &amp; the other about obama. having a close relationship with someone is not hard evidence,
what the ppl did in skorea has to happen everywhere.

                           thanks for the effort but thats what i mean , no hard evidences , she claimed to have stated , "satanic" , "satanic cult" , 
if you clink a link called according to sources , it directs to financial times &amp; you have to pay to see it.then halfway the page theres a youtube video with a german girl who survived satanic abuse , which has nothing to do with skorea . but she does connects to dutroux case in belgium.
                          </p>
                          <p>
                           and theres someone always stepping down , in skorea the president , but the system remains the same.
                          </p>
                          <p>
                           no change. and thats what i think is the goal of the whole effort (voat &amp; other places alike); in the end no real change , eveything stays the same.
i wouldnt be surprised this place is full of pedos &amp; secret service.
                          </p>
                          <p>
                           the ppl in belgium had way less evidence as we do now. yet noone wants to think about long term changes &amp; effect ? how is this possible ?

                            Thanks for the insight...esp regarding Belgium.  I do remember reading about that uproar.  It did have some effect, but Belgium is worse with elite Pedos now than it was when that broke (Dutrix case?).  I have been focused on some kind of uprising (similar to Korea, which we k own happened, regardless of the reason or 'hard evidentce' etc), but I agree - what did it really change?  If nothing else, it shows the moral health of the country.  Ultimately my worldview is filtered through my faith as a Christian. The end of that Christain story only leads to a world run by Satanists, death, destruction and war i.e. End-times.  Regardless, with pizzagate, I would like to see an uprising due to citizen awareness that ultimately a spiritual awakening due to mass disgust that takes our country away from the grips of the evil monied NWO Freaks.

                             dutroux actually worked for the masons. and because the official narrative denied any knowledge about any networks , national or international , 
allot of pedophiles stayed in place.
the uproar in skorea didn't change much because it was contained. humanity is divided in many ways , but this abuse of the innocent
is a common factor for the whole of humanity , here although we are very different , we find common ground.
this will strenghten us in a uprise to stand together against the "illuminati" , thats why massive global protests are mandatory to
experience true freedom &amp; justice , this will bring a new spiritual awakening.

             Which is why i have a loaded AR15 and several pistols loaded sitting around my house.  If they kill Trump and start a Coup I figure a turning point in Civilization has taken place and I could not live with myself years from now if I just sat by and let it happen.  If if goes down.....rally to the sound of the guns....and take some Illuminati child killers with you.  If your not willing to fight against a Global Sadistic Satanic child raping and killing and eating Cult....then frankly your not much of a human.  So just stay out of our way.

              Honestly, given that we know "they" read voat etc occasionally and that they judge public opinion based off internet discussion, let's be as fucking clear and loud about this as possible. It is ABSOLUTE EXISTENTIAL WAR if this doesn't get exposed or if attempts to expose it are met with force. Let's show them exactly how well we understand the threat. We know who you are, Sabbatean-Frankist weirdoes at the top of this whole sham. We have the lists of Black Nobility family names and Council of 300. We know who the problem is. If things don't start changing soon, there will be a resistance.

            Holy shit. Shit is getting real people.I know it seems counter intuitive but after feeling REALLY despondent about Pedo/PizzaGate for the last 24 hours, this gives me hope as I just have a feeling this nut is about to crack wide open...and so the cockroaches are running for cover.

            Pizzagate/pedogate is all anyone wants to talk about on /pol/, obviously because it's the only thing that matters right now in terms of politics, I can guarantee you this, but if you head over there there isn't a single pizzagate thread, any thread that mentions it gets slid immediately or just straight up deleted, the only threads up are obvious shareblue shill threads. 4chan is on its last legs, Hiro has probably been threatened, the site will probably be gone within the month. Amazing...

             It will destroy the country, when people realize both sides (Obama and Trump and Reid and McConnel and Clinton and just about every other politician) have fucked kids to gain the offices which they have used to rape the world.

               He/She is right. There is no left/right/black/white. That is all a lie. What there is - is control mechanisms in place in order to maintain control of financial,political,social societies. Once you realize that and see why they keep everyone fighting you start to fight back. Now you go off on david brock and all other shit that is meaningless why?
              </p>
              <p>
               This whole thing is to expose who and what mechanisms are in control and release that so the people can regain control. Pedos are being controlled. They are also the ones in power right now. We need to get that info to the people. Doing what you just did doesnt help that one bit.

            I hate to take credit (and none is probably due), and my little tidbit might be total BS, but I posted on some pizza threads about a porn vid on xhamster that might have been taken in Comet. Then pol started getting whacky. Please tell me I'm wrong and check out the vid. Go to xhamster.com. Videos. Search: "My friend fucking my girlfriend in my restaurant." Sorry bout the language. It's a "amateur" sex scene. Short. Don't worry the gal looks of age. But there are toys and a coloring book near her head, which is a pedo theme not mentioned in the description of the vid. Look at the carpet/ blanket/ pallet. Anyone recognize it from pics from inside Comet?

             Dude you cant see crap from that video....I dont think it is related unless you have more to tell us?  But I will say you can not tell how old the girl is either....she isnt a pre teen but she could be below the age of 17 so I suggest no one go there.

             I believe zeronet is the best we have now for decentralized reddit; eventually the best solution will be a dapp on ethereum.

             places like raw story on FB needs us to like the page so it shows up on your feed, so when they run the right story "ivanka trump dissapointed she is not going to make money of the presidency" then you meme Clinton foundation monies.....and how they dry up, when she lost...then pedo busts after they leave...i dunno just a thought.
            </p>
            <p>
             they have literally lots of followers, i was once one.....i would say that many of them are decent people. once faced with the horrible truth, they will come to a decision.....i will say leave the god stuff out of it...that wont get you anywhere.
