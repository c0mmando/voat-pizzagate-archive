<p>Weird, so this same exact address is linked to a Child Day Care Center. Not sure if it\'s still in use. Appears that the Pee Wee\'s Playhouse is an extension. All windows are boarded up. </p>

           Weird, so this same exact address is linked to a Child Day Care Center. Not sure if it's still in use. Appears that the Pee Wee's Playhouse is an extension. All windows are boarded up.
