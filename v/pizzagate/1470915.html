<p>*** This one is a doozy: the priest and Catholic Church openly admitted to satanic ritual abuse* **</p>
<p><strong>Priest Did ‘Ritual Killing’</strong> The Courier Mail (May 26, 2006) by Gary Hughes</p>
<p>A CATHOLIC priest took part in satanic murders and rituals that included child sexual abuse. The Catholic Church’s Melbourne Archdiocese has accepted claims about the rituals as “substantially true” and paid $33,000 compensation to a man who was a victim of the rituals as a child. </p>
<p><strong>‘Extraordinary’ claims true: Catholic Church, NEWS.com.au (May 26, 2006, 12:02) by Gary Hughes</strong></p>
<p>The most extraordinary thing about today’s allegations of murders during satanic rituals involving a Melbourne priest is not that they’ve been made, but that the Catholic Church admitted in writing that it accepted they were substantially true. </p>

<p><strong>Ritual abuse victim responds to critics</strong>, NEWS.com.au, (May 29, 2006, 12:02) by Gary Hughes</p>
<p>“First of all, thank you to all the commenters for taking the time to read Gary Hughes’ article on my situation and for giving your reactions. A number of issues have been raised and I would like to respond to them in turn. These issues as I see them are:</p>
<p>the time I took to bring forth the allegations;
the issue of missing persons not triggering police investigations;
whether these “memories” are recovered by hypnosis or other means;
what evidence can I produce to support these claims;
did the Church pay out only for the sexual abuse of that priest or did it include payment for the ritual abuse;
what caused the Church to acknowledge my claim;
and whether the priest was acting outside his role as a Catholic priest.
To take the last point first, very clearly the priest was acting against the teachings of the Catholic Church…&quot;</p>

<p><strong>Chanting, spells and sex orgies at St Stanislaus College</strong>, Herald Sun (August 27, 2008) by Gemma Jones</p>
<p>POLICE are investigating claims that up to 40 boys were sexually abused by a pedophile ring of priests and teachers at an exclusive NSW school… A former priest at the school has been charged with 33 counts, a former teacher has already been convicted of several offences and two other teachers are under investigation.</p>
<p>In his first interview, a brave young man who used the internet to expose the abuse revealed the full extent of the horror at the school. He is one of two victims who have told The Daily Telegraph how they were herded into a prayer room by a priest chanting “hypnotic” spells in tongues. Inside the prayer room, the boarders who attended the school in the 1980s said they were subjected to horrendous sexual abuse or forced to assault each other…</p>
<p>... Police last night confirmed 13 alleged victims had already come forward.</p>
<p><strong>Priests and justice</strong>,  Sydney Morning Herald (January 9, 2010) by David Marr</p>
<p>After two years of investigation, charges of pedophilia at St Stanislaus’ College, Bathurst, are moving to trial.</p>
<p>One winter day a couple of years ago, a troubled man walked the streets of Bathurst, handing out leaflets accusing a priest of sexual abuse. Tor Steven Nielsen’s life was a mess. A few weeks before this dash to Bathurst he had posted on his website a grim résumé of his 35 years: “As it stands now I am a convicted criminal who has been certified as delusional.</p>
<p>“I have no education, no house, no job, no job references, no licence, no car, no super, no savings. To this day, they are putting Drugs in my food and I find it very distressing…my life has been completely destroyed.”</p>
<p>Twenty years earlier, Nielsen had boarded for a few terms at Bathurst’s St Stanislaus’ College, where he was sexually abused by a teacher....</p>

<p><strong>Liberal senator Bill Heffernan says <em>former prime minister</em> a suspected paedophile</strong>, Sydney Morning Herald (October 21, 2015) by Jane Lee
(A Prime Minister is Australia\'s equivalent to America\'s President)</p>
<p>A former Australian prime minister is on a list of “alleged pedophiles” that Liberal senator Bill Heffernan claims forms part of a police document.  
</p>
<p>Senator Heffernan used a Senate estimates committee hearing on Tuesday to discuss the list of 28 people, which he said formed part of police documents that had been “signed off” by Gary Crooke, QC, the former senior counsel assisting NSW’s Wood royal commission into police corruption in the 1990s. Mr Crooke declined to comment when contacted by Fairfax Media on Tuesday.   
</p>
<p>Many of the people on the list and otherwise named in the documents were “prominent”, including a former prime minister, Senator Heffernan said: “They were delivered to me by a police agency some time ago because no one seems to want to deal with them.”  Every Commonwealth attorney-general since Philip Ruddock had seen the list, Senator Heffernan said… </p>

<p><strong>Brisbane Grammar counsellor ritually abused students, royal commission told</strong>, The Guardian (4 November, 2015 08:00) by Joshua Robertson</p>
<p>A counsellor at a prestigious Queensland private school ritually hypnotised students before masturbating them, slapping them in the face and putting acupuncture needles in one child’s genitals, the royal commission into institutional responses to child sex abuse has heard. The scores of alleged victims of Kevin Lynch at Brisbane Grammar school included a boy who was sexually abused in a grief counselling session given after learning his father had committed suicide… </p>

           In his first interview, a brave young man who used the internet to expose the abuse revealed the full extent of the horror at the school. He is one of two victims who have told The Daily Telegraph how they were herded into a prayer room by a priest chanting “hypnotic” spells in tongues. Inside the prayer room, the boarders who attended the school in the 1980s said they were subjected to horrendous sexual abuse or forced to assault each other…

           After two years of investigation, charges of pedophilia at St Stanislaus’ College, Bathurst, are moving to trial.

          <p>
           One winter day a couple of years ago, a troubled man walked the streets of Bathurst, handing out leaflets accusing a priest of sexual abuse. Tor Steven Nielsen’s life was a mess. A few weeks before this dash to Bathurst he had posted on his website a grim résumé of his 35 years: “As it stands now I am a convicted criminal who has been certified as delusional.
          </p>
          <p>
           “I have no education, no house, no job, no job references, no licence, no car, no super, no savings. To this day, they are putting Drugs in my food and I find it very distressing…my life has been completely destroyed.”
          </p>

           Twenty years earlier, Nielsen had boarded for a few terms at Bathurst’s St Stanislaus’ College, where he was sexually abused by a teacher....

           A former Australian prime minister is on a list of “alleged pedophiles” that Liberal senator Bill Heffernan claims forms part of a police document.
          </p>
          <p>
           Senator Heffernan used a Senate estimates committee hearing on Tuesday to discuss the list of 28 people, which he said formed part of police documents that had been “signed off” by Gary Crooke, QC, the former senior counsel assisting NSW’s Wood royal commission into police corruption in the 1990s. Mr Crooke declined to comment when contacted by Fairfax Media on Tuesday.
          </p>
          <p>
           Many of the people on the list and otherwise named in the documents were “prominent”, including a former prime minister, Senator Heffernan said: “They were delivered to me by a police agency some time ago because no one seems to want to deal with them.”  Every Commonwealth attorney-general since Philip Ruddock had seen the list, Senator Heffernan said…

          <p>
           A counsellor at a prestigious Queensland private school ritually hypnotised students before masturbating them, slapping them in the face and putting acupuncture needles in one child’s genitals, the royal commission into institutional responses to child sex abuse has heard. The scores of alleged victims of Kevin Lynch at Brisbane Grammar school included a boy who was sexually abused in a grief counselling session given after learning his father had committed suicide…

            Thank you for posting. The world needs to know that #pizzagate / pedophilia is a global problem that must be exposed. The shame is on those who hide from knowing and exposing the truth.

             all new threads seem to be copping a standard downvote at the moment.. doesnt really matter, people are clever enough to see merit and upvote it. downvotes on good content are futile.
