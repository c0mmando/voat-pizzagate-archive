<p>First off, I want to mention there is a long list of dead bankers, going back almost a decade now.

<p>This woman\'s blog, has many(if not all) of these names.

<p>We get up to the time of the Panama Papers release. Right around the same time as pizzagate broke.
<a href="https://www.icij.org/investigations/panama-papers/">https://www.icij.org/investigations/panama-papers/</a></p>
<p>The Panama Papers are still being investigated. There are very few stories that I find in MSM relating directly to bringing justice to ALL OF US. We are the victims of these peoples mismanagement of money.</p>
<p>Recently, China has gained controlling interest of the Panama Canal, itself. AFTER the Panama Papers were released.
<a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-panama-canal-land-idUSKBN16Y13J">https://www.reuters.com/article/us-panama-canal-land-idUSKBN16Y13J</a></p>
<p>The Panama Canal is the key trade route between the Eastern America\'s and the Far East. If you understand this, you\'ll see how important it could be in trafficking ANYTHING.</p>
<p>Finding connections between NXIVM members of political South American nations, is also an aspect of this.</p>
<p>Lastly, I want to ask help from anyone with the time and skills to lend.
We need to find any and all possible personal connections between these thousands of names and the flight logs of Jeffrey Epstein\'s, Lolita Express.

<p>This is all a logical leap and obviously seems connected, at least to me.</p>
<p>Thank you for your time reading this. Know that there have been many &quot;suicides&quot; relating to people investigating many aspects of what I have mentioned above. People such as Nancy Schaefer and Max Max Spiers, can\'t be forgotten for what little they knew and tried to bring to light.</p>',

            Ok well norapandora it's a nice long list but I'm sure you realise not all of these people are going to be linked.. I mean I changed jobs or "stepped down" around that timeframe and that doesn't mean I had anything to do with this..
For example.. Julian Assange stepped down.. if he had anything to hide stepping down wouldn't protect him in any way.. 
Many of those listed could have some connection to Panama papers etc.. and well it's somewhere to start..
BTW I'm New Zealand our Prime Minister at the time Jon Key suddenly without warning quit his job "to spend more time with his family" which was a huge surprise to many considering his normal character.. basically it was totally out of character.. plus he has a bad reputation for having no conscience at all and also some allegations of sexual misconduct.
Plus his daughter promotes satansim on Instagram so yea he is as dodgy as it comes and I'm certain Jon Key is a key player (no pun intended) in the Panama stuff with his connections..
People need to investigate Jon Key!! Banker/Mason and CIA agent.

             I know not all names will connect in a meaningful way. I just have always felt there is some connections between the releasing of the Panama Papers and the emails from HRC and Weiner. There has been a long list of dead bankers for years now and I'm guessing when they finish investigating the Panama Papers, some of those dead bankers may be vindicated. Someday, all of the trillions of dollars missing from the Pentagon, will likely somehow connect to a few of the key people involved in all of this.

            HSBC direct connection.

            This article mentions Jeffrey Epstein using HSBC.

           <p>
            Looking back almost two decades, you can find there are a few strange banker deaths, just with HSBC alone.

              Up top where Socialist China gets 40 years concessions to the Panama Canal. That would not fly under the Monroe Doctrine, and furthermore there would be no militarized Chinese fishing vessels plundering our seas and selling it right back to us. Two or more birds with one stone.

               Okay, I see where you were going then. I was thinking perhaps some other connection. Yes, China will be doing all of this and more. I'm just curious if they leaned on our government to change the doctrine due to the amount of debt they own of ours, or if they blackmailed the right people.

               They'll likely turn land into agricultural. They may try to build their own man-made islands in international waters, around there as well. I can see some other aspects of what they may do.

                Johnny Horton - The Battle Of New Orleans - when the cowboy sings. If you look at history, both the Tsar of Russia, and China, gave the revolutionaries Gold for the War of Independence. The Czar and his family were executed and tortured. Russia got taken over by the most brutal socialist dictatorship since Egypt? They are full on slave collar. What does the rest of the world not understand?. Back then they were vying for control. Not, or nyet you. We paid China back a billion times with all the fireworks. Royal Family paid with their lives, and the commoner peasants suffered much worse.. It is time to start making fireworks back home.

             The woman in this article, had her name changed and she was detained by the Egyptian government for running a child brothel in Egypt. The list of her clients is why the Egyptian government wanted nothing to do with her case. She was handed over to Trump.
            </p>
            <p>
             Does she possess goods on the likes of Soros and his kinsmen? Does she possess goods on people named in the Panama Papers?
