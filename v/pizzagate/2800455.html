<p>Kamala Harris Covered Up For San Francisco Archdiocese Sex Abuse</p>
<p>More than eight years ago in 2010, Kamala Harris, then-San Francisco District Attorney, was running for California Attorney General. And for some reason, her record of covering up sex abuse records belonging to the San Francisco Archdiocese was never part of the political news of her record. Today, Harris is a United States Senator, with an eye for running for President in 2020.</p>
<p>She was San Francisco District Attorney from 2003 until her election in 2010 to State Attorney General.</p>
<p>Reporter Matt Smith at San Francisco Weekly reported in 2010 that Harris rebuffed reporters’ efforts for five years to view her office’s files on Catholic clergy sex abuse under the state Public Records Act, despite statements by former San Francisco DA Terence Hallinan saying they should be released.</p>
<p>The files in question involve the San Francisco Archdiocese files on clergy abuse, and contain details of how the church dealt internally with alleged pederast, homosexual and pedophile priests going back as far as 80 years,according to a second SF Weekly article. Cardinal William Levada was archbishop of San Francisco until 2005.</p>
<p>Matt Smith reported:</p>
<p>Portions of this record came to light in stories by then—SF Weekly staff writer Ron Russell in 2005 and in a May 5 story in The New York Times that recounted elements of Russell’s reporting. By sifting through documents made public as a result of lawsuits, Russell learned that during the 1990s and 2000s, Levada helped keep allegations against pedophile priests shrouded in secrecy. Alleged abusers included Salesian Brother Salvatore Billante, who police alleged had sexual relations with at least 24 children, but charges were dropped after the California Supreme Court overturned a state law extending the statute of limitations for pedophiles. And so the full contents of archdiocese clergy abuse files obtained by prosecutors were never revealed at trial.</p>
<p>Relatively unscathed by his San Francisco legacy, now-Cardinal Levada is the chief Vatican official charged with responding to global allegations of clergy abuse.</p>
<p>Blanket secrecy privilege</p>
<p>In response to Smith’s Public Records Request, Harris’s office said her investigative files were not subject to California’s Public Records Act, and claimed her office essentially enjoys a blanket secrecy privilege.</p>
<p>Smith sent Harris’ response to California Newspaper Publishers Association legal counsel Jim Ewert. “That’s flatly untrue,” Ewert said. The District Attorney’s office “can release them if they want to. But they have decided not to.”</p>
<p>As of 2010, the Archdiocese of San Francisco settled 101 abuse cases and paid $68 million in settlements since 2003, the New York Times reported.</p>
<p>An official accounting of accused priests in the Bay Area has never been made public, but an organization that collects news and data about clergy abuse lists the names of 86 publicly accused priests among dioceses in San Francisco (37), Oakland (25), Santa Rosa (14) and San Jose (10). Many of those named have settled lawsuits out of court, and most are not in prison, the New York Times reported.</p>
<p>Kamala Harris could have legally intervened, but did not. Inquiring minds want to know why she did not?</p>
<p>Kamala\'s Misplaced Priorities</p>
<p>As District Attorney, Harris ran into some other ethical difficulties as well: In 2010, a California superior court judge excoriated Harris’ office for failing to notify defense lawyers of known misconduct by a drug lab technician that later led the San Francisco police to shut down an entire section of the lab.</p>
<p>As California Attorney General Kamala Harris ordered a raid on the home of David Daledin, who in 2015 exposed Planned Parenthood officials openly discussing buying and selling the body parts and organs from aborted babies for research, through Undercover videos, I reported in 2017. Rather than opening an investigation into Planned Parenthood for trafficking in human body parts, California’s then-Attorney General Kamala Harris, a Democrat, filed charges against the undercover investigators, David Daleiden and Sandra Merritt of the Center for Medical Progress. Harris ordered Daleiden’s home to be raided, and using 11 agents, confiscated video research and evidence, in an attempt to prevent millions of people from seeing what actually goes on inside Planned Parenthood.</p>
<p>Diocese Payouts To Sex Abuse Victims</p>
<p>The Roman Catholic Diocese of Sacramento, which covers 20 counties from the San Francisco Bay Area to the Oregon border, came under fire in 2005 when 33 people accused 10 priests of sexual assault from decades earlier. The diocese settled the lawsuit, offering $35 million to victims one day before a civil trial was to begin, USA Today reported.</p>
<p>Since the mid-1980s Catholic dioceses and religious orders have paid out nearly $3 billion in out of court settlements and court orders awards, according to the watchdog group Bishopaccountability.org.</p>
<p>These are the major awards and settlements since 2000 of the San Francisco Archdiocese, according to National Catholic Reporter—all while Kamala Harris was District Attorney:</p>
<p>2005-04-20—San Francisco, California—$5.8 million—4</p>
<p>2005-06-10—San Francisco, California—$21.2 million—15</p>
<p>2005-07-08—San Francisco, California—$16.0 million—12</p>
<p>2005-10-11—San Francisco, California—$2.6million—2</p>
<p>Warnings Shelved and Ignored</p>
<p>An NCR cover story reported that in 1985, a 92-page report on clergy sex abuse was distributed to U.S. bishops concerning more than 100 lawsuits that could predictably cost a billion dollars.</p>
<p>The Rev. Thomas Doyle, a Vatican canon lawyer; Raymond Mouton Jr., a Louisiana criminal lawyer who defended the Rev. Gilbert Gauthe, a notorious pedophile priest; and the Rev. Michael Peterson, a psychiatrist, produced the strongly worded document that argued for immediate action to deal with sexual molestation in the church.</p>
<p>The New York Times reported:</p>
<p>In 1985, Cardinal Levada, then a young auxiliary bishop from Los Angeles, was sent by church leaders to meet with the men. The meeting at a Chicago airport hotel went on all day, Father Doyle and Mr. Mouton said recently, with Bishop Levada going through their report almost line by line. They said he seemed enthusiastic about their proposals.</p>
<p>Two weeks later, however, the bishop called Father Doyle and told him that their report was being shelved and that the bishops would convene their own committee to examine the issue. But no such group materialized.</p>
<p>Two decades later, in various sworn depositions, Cardinal Levada would assert that he recalled little from the meeting. But his detailed briefing would have given him a far deeper awareness of the issue than a vast majority of church officials at the time.</p>
<p>It is difficult not to believe in a magnificent conspiracy to cover up the sexual abuse, pederasty and homosexual priests and seminarians. It is also not difficult to connect human trafficking rings to this conspiracy.</p>

              This is very important and I wish everyone would know and understand that when u send in your DNA to those 23 N Me and Ancestry DNA they look for certain DNA of people connected to those in power centuries back in history. Tammy Reif has such DNA and she stated that she believed they were waiting for before her son was born to take him because of her family ancestry. She even stated that the CIA has a division that tracks these people and they know who and where they are. I do 100% believe this and this is extremely frightening. Jonah Reif lineage is of French royalty spanning back centuries. It sounds as though they want to groom him to become some kind of leader in the future whether political or the likes. This case is corrupt to the very core with even HLN tv network airing a national story that Jonah was kidnaped by his mom to find him when she hid him from that Sullivan pedofile. Unbelievable this case is shocking.

            This "lady" is at the center of many things. She was reprimanded because "the secret Masonic police force" was being ran out of her political office but, her staff went down with her somehow being innocent but her staff was arrested.

            Turns out no one was convicted even though there was plenty of guilt to go around because their leader faked his own death INSIDE of the courtroom. He supposedly had a heart attack in court so all the charges got dropped.

             I have a feeling they have marked her from early on to run for President and no matter what she does or gets in trouble for, they will ignore it all and cover for her.  There has to be a concerted effort to yell out loud about what she has done.  She is their future candidate no matter what.  They will push her like they did BO and it will have to be up to us to get all the dirt out.  Yes, the Female Obama is how she will be sold.  I voted for him twice and we both rue the day.  But then both choices were horrid.  Mitt Romney would have pushed the Mormon Mafia.  These are scary times.

            "As California Attorney General Kamala Harris ordered a raid on the home of David Daledin, who in 2015 exposed Planned Parenthood officials openly discussing buying and selling the body parts and organs from aborted babies for research, through Undercover videos, I reported in 2017. Rather than opening an investigation into Planned Parenthood for trafficking in human body parts, California’s then-Attorney General Kamala Harris, a Democrat, filed charges against the undercover investigators, David Daleiden and Sandra Merritt of the Center for Medical Progress. Harris ordered Daleiden’s home to be raided, and using 11 agents, confiscated video research and evidence, in an attempt to prevent millions of people from seeing what actually goes on inside Planned Parenthood."
SHE SHOULD BE ARRESTED AND TRIED FOR OBSTRUCTION OF JUSTICE!

             15 Felony Charges Against David Daleiden in California Are Bogus, Former Prosecutors Say
            </p>
            <p>
             Two former Los Angeles area prosecutors have said that California's attorney general was wrong to charge pro-life activist David Daleiden and his associate with 15 felony charges for their undercover work that exposed Planned Parenthood's illegal aborted baby body parts reimbursement practices.
            </p>
            <p>
             If she runs for anything again and especially for the office of President of the US, this case and her hiding of the sexual abuse cases for the RCC should be blasted over the airwaves.  Seems like she as a hatred for Whistle Blowers.

"Cuddalore, Tamil Nadu, Nov 30 (UNI) The nondescript village of Thazhanguda in this coastal district is awaiting the arrival of Former US President Bill Clinton tomorrow. This will be his final visit to tsunami-affected regions as the UN Special Envoy for Tsunami Recovery. Mr Clinton, who is expected to complete his two-year tenure as Special Envoy this year-end, will arrive here at 1000 hrs during his first leg of the tour to review the progress in tsunami recovery efforts over the last two years. He will drive straight to the worst hit Thazhanguda Village where the 2004 tsunami orphaned 480 children and widowed 787 women are living. He will visit a new housing complex there constructed for affected fisherfolk, and a rehabilitated school."

               That certainly sounds plausible.  Very close to his name.   We should not be surprised that they were connected to the Panama Papers either.  I really did not think of them as quite High Level as John P or his brother Tony.  Evidently they are and now we know how evil she really is  Holding back the information that could lead to the justice that so many Victims and Survivors have been waiting for.  Greedy Wench.

                She operated with a bizarre secret police department.

                She is inextricably tied to the laundering of money by the Clinton cabal via Maya Harris, Alefantis, the Podestas, etc.

                She is deserving of research because they are going to put her at the forefront of the Democratic party and it is best for everyone if that incriminating information gets out as fast as possible.

                 Yes, well Hillary is too tainted and too old so they must find a new Cc. She is already following in her footsteps and she also has BO's skin color.  Money laundering.  Yes.  They have trained her well to take over for Hillary.  The rest of them are all proficient in it as well.  Biden seems to be taking charge right now, but I will not be surprised if he is just a dark horse for the moment.  A type of Smoke Screen until they unveil her possibly.  If not this time around she will definitely get her turn.  These facts have really woken my up.

                  Since Harris is almost certain to end up on the ticket, raising awareness about  her foul connections early will yield an appropriate response.

             "It’s a matter of public record, though not loudly trumpeted, that she cheated to win the job as Attorney General. The Saturday papers reported, casually enough, that her campaign “paid a fine” for illegal campaign spending, specifically violating a city-mandated spending cap. It is not questionable if an election in which one side wins after spending more money than is legally allowed is, indeed, a valid election? Though, seeing as how she was now the Attorney General, she evidently elected not to prosecute herself. … Deep, deep, deep pockets. There’s a specifically San Francisco irony in knowingly breaking the law in order to become the city’s top prosecutor."

             Believe it or not, I have some Dem friends that are on to her.  I don't think they know about this hiding of abuse records, but they are not into her  So she is going to have to do a lot of work and if they pound this into people over and over, well I think she is dead in the water. Hoping so, anyway.

           <p>
            who police alleged had sexual relations with at least 24 children,     Now I didn't catch it the first time around, but adults and children don't have sexual relations.  Adults have sexual relations.  When it concerns a priest and a child it is called Rape.  A Freudian Slip?

             age of consent is different worldwide

            <p>
             The lowest Age of Consent in the world is 11, in Nigeria. The age of consent is 12 in the Philippines and Angola, and 13 in Burkina Faso, Comoros, Niger, and Japan.
            </p>
            <p>
             The highest Age of Consent in the world is 21 in Bahrain. The second-highest age of consent is 20 in South Korea

            <p>
             several Middle Eastern and African countries have no legal age of consent, but ban all sexual relations outside of marriage. This has raised concerns by many international organizations, especially in some countries where girls are married at as young as 9 or 10 years old.

              Good God, 21?  Maybe that is too old, but I would definitely pick it over the younger ages.  I think 18 is a pretty good decision, if it is enforced.  I think something like that should be the same all over the country not different in each state.  Yeah, we still have some young ages here too.  Many have gotten married here to at 13 still.  I think NJ had a problem with that and they tried to vote it out but Christy would not sign it.  Yeah I am SMH too.

                marriage with parents?  Wow.  Well, this country really is going to HE77 in a hand basket.  We must start pushing for changes.  We must start taking it the other way and that is a great way to start.
