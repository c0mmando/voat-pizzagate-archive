<p>On the outside she seems to be your typical 20 something model with 100K followers on her instagram, but she claims to have much more to share... Two days ago she began posting hints about \'undercover work\' , \'CIA Headquarters\' , and inside knowledge about powerful sexual predators.

<p>She then posts :</p>

<p>and finally about 4 hrs ago: </p>
<blockquote>

<p>She then presumably posts the Expose in the form of a &quot;Story&quot; which (as you can tell) FAILS TO LOAD! <a href="https://www.instagram.com/stories/highlights/18106680454032950/">https://www.instagram.com/stories/highlights/18106680454032950/</a></p>
<p>CENSORED within an hour of the post.  This tells me whatever information contained was very sensitive, or at the very least has a significant enough following to cause concern from the predators.</p>
<p>If that was all, I would probably would not asked for you Goats help- people get censored every day. </p>
<p>BUT,</p>
<p>When followers asked about the dead link and <em>if she had been censored</em>, she responded: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>yes</p>
<p>i will repost when i am out of my house</p>
<p><strong>i need protection</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Goats, I think <strong>this woman needs our help</strong>. </p>
<p>I know there is not much to go on but this is happening now, so if I can get the A team to Archive whatever she is able to get out, Dig on what exists, and help with any ideas to make sure she is okay- we might be able to make a difference. </p>

            Well , that's odd. Only a week ago, she called him 'Mr. Snuggles', and thanked him for providing the room where the photo was taken.

           <p>
            It's almost as if she had read my comments about her praising Ratner, or someone alerted her to it. ;-) So maybe she realized it would undermine her credibility if she gave a shoutout to Ratner. Weird.

             It is definitely weird. While I am still approaching this cautiously as a potential 'honeypot for survivors' or researchers, and it
             <em>
              is
             </em>
             possible that she switched the narrative after reading something, I believe she was being sarcastic/threatening when thanking Ratner and calling him Mr. Snuggles, knowing she would soon be outing him shortly. Not a wise tactic to use sarcasm in text (thank you), or alert the accused of your intent (tagging Brett), however it  seems (after such a damning caption) more likely to be referencing his preferred predatory method to scare him. This likely backfired i.e. censorship, and "I NEED PROTECTION" -but is where I am leaning after she released (on her story / sorry don't know how to archive that) screenshots of texts between them where he asks repeatedly to "snuggle".  In the comments of her latest related post, she talks about the party/incident at the Hillhaven Lodge, where Brett was 'following her around' until she felt uncomfortable 'thanked them for the acid, and left'. Perhaps this is the reason for the thank you for the location?
            </p>
            <p>
             That being said, I do not see any guilt of a crime beyond sexual harassment for Ratner: "I was not raped",  she has not added any names to the list of high ranking predators, nor expanded on her claim that they target underage women. While I hope justice is served, perhaps our efforts are better allocated elsewhere.

               You're not wrong about the red flags though... Really wonder about the Lodge, and Ratner, which I would have completely missed if it weren't for you. Appreciate you weighing in on this.

              Everybody in Hollywood knows about the sexual harassment allegations against Ratner.

             <p>
              That she is teaming up with him is proof that she isn't legit imo.

               Claims Brett introduced this much younger actress to future boyfriend Mick Jagger (25 and 73)  who is rumored to now be dating Clint Eastwood. WTF. Maybe this Rat is more integral than we think.

              It’s called transgenderuniverse down the page on a google search. The blurb about “her” is quite telling as I posted it above. I knew something was off looking at the IG pics. The bikini body photos are way too muscular for a female so thin, usually a woman is more bulky with a lot of definition. Also, Christina Lawrence was a contestant featured in A Shot At Love an MTV show obviously to humiliate the two Jersey Shore guys. The real question is, why would anyone posting serious matters about child trafficking and then start posting products they are selling right after and their personal gym membership stuff if they were serious and in danger? This person does seem serious and then rants on numerous posts about being in the CIA and working for the gov... come on, why say that? I haven’t seen the proof or the info on what Chris was talking about in the first place or the list of name he complied.

               After going through her pics, I agree that she might be a biologicial male. (Although Pilates can do amazing things to your muscles ;-)).

               She isn't the 'ChristinaDreams' transperson on the website you found though, that's someone else.

                The photo on that website isn’t her I know but the description fits perfectly including the ethnicity. I absolutely 100% do not believe Christina is a natural born female at all. She is a HE. Also this person makes a living as a high priced escort, so now out of the blue he is rattling out big name johns? All the while claiming he is CIA working for the gov? None of what is coming out of this persons mouth makes any sense. Have you seen the evidence or video that was the proof? I have not but would like to view it to see if there is anything to the children being trafficked.

                 No, she didn't post any evidence. Please check out OP's edit of the post. I called her out for giving a shoutout to alleged sexual predator Brett Ratner, and now she changed her story about him.

             Fair enough. I wanted your opinion, and your proficiency archiving if indeed she did post a
             <em>
              list
             </em>
             or other relevant evidence. None as of yet, so I probably should have posted this to whatever.

            <p>
             I read :
            </p>
            <blockquote>
             <p>
              These men sexually exploit underage girls and young women
             </p>
             <p>
              ...and thought it looked like their M.O.

              I could be wrong.

           </p>
           <p>
            Couldn't sign into my own computer with my own password. Had to do a hard reset. Chrome screen flickering and opening new windows without me clicking. I know,
            <em>
             chrome
            </em>
            . Coincidence or over/i'm the target?

                Look srayzie, it’s all good. I don’t give a fuck one way or the other.I don’t think you handled yourself well when things got uncomfortable, I don’t think anyone involved did. It’s over (atleast for me).inho which is all it is nobody took the high road and as a result the whole site suffered.moving on be the voat you want it to be.

                   I appreciate that. Mostly just so you don't waste that juicy feud between you and mystery Srayzie, on me. Though now I am curious, I totally understand your skepticism. This one is sketchy at best...

                   Is her acct really hacked? Sorry, I am a little 'simp' today and have no pretense, or desire to make your experience here suffer.

             It's best if you don't delete, but instead edit your post with whatever was uncovered, and we flair to "Debunked" (if there's proof) or "Accuracy?" if there isn't so that folks who search for this person in the future will see what was discovered and know not to get roped in.
            </p>
            <p>
             I'm not certain we are actually to that point, yet. I looked at her pics, and that is not the skeletal structure of a biological male. I don't see any evidence of the "tranny" claim. That may be further attempts to censor/debunk her assertions to frame her as a fraud.
            </p>
            <p>
             Regarding the computer issues you developed, a very similar thing happened to me during the Podesta email investigation, before I was careful about whose sites I visited.

             How did this capture your attention in the first place, just out of curiousity?
