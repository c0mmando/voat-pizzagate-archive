<p>The research into this shows that beginning in 1973 or so, a movement was formed to gain legal status for pedophiliacs.

<p>And then there was the &quot;Wonderland Club&quot; that was a network of people who exchanged child sex pictures and videos. To join the club you had to submit original pictures of children. It was not just pictures. It was videos. It was sounds. It was the sounds of children being raped. And the children became like STARS in the network. Some people would travel to take pictures with their favorite &quot;stars.&quot;

<p>And so, I am suggesting that many of the pizzagate pictures with children are actually trophies of admirers of the sex videos and pictures the &quot;stars&quot; are in. And as is said in the video, when they broke up the Wonderland Club, it just found another venue. It is called the Wonderland Club after Alice in Wonderland. Lewis Carroll fell in love with his 4-year old student, Alice. Now there is an &quot;Alice Day&quot; in which pedophiles wear pink. Some say it is April 25, some July 4. April 25 is the day Lewis Carroll met Alice. July 4 is the day he took Alice and her sisters on a canoe trip and told them stories that he later made into Alice In Wonderland.</p>
<p>I believe that to understand this whole investigation, one must understand the pedophile world and what they believe, and what they do.</p>

            HRC's "Children Under the Law" of course was written by a lawyer, her.  If you read it, it may not sound all that harmful, but to a lawyer it could of course be argued many ways.  That is the whole purpose.  To twist and turn it so that they can have their way with our children. Remember her first case.  The 15 year old girl that was raped.  The rapist was her client and she won the case.

              Thanks for that.  Forgot.  You are right she was 12.  I and Wolftrail7272 have been doing deep research on this and other doings around Wonderland.  We believe that there was something developed to replace it.  Do not think for one moment that they would just give up on something so lucrative nor give up their perverted pleasures.  Why do you think they called it Operation Cathedral? That is a clue.

            The thing that doesn't make sense about pedos stating that children can consent to having any contact with an adult is that most pedos are the stalkers and harrassers of children. Like a predatory animal, once they see a potential victim they go in for the kill.

             so agree. I If children were to "consent" as they call it, it would be because they have been tricked.  Tricked by people they trust.  Children trust adults that are close to them or in a higher authority to have their backs.  Thus they can easily be tricked into consenting to things that are wrong.  Thus these sick perverts brain wash themselves into believing these children are lusting after them.  Wrong.    EDIT: "They will regroup, and become as big as they were."  Statement by an Interviewed pedophile.  It has regrouped and is somewhere here in the USA.  I propose it is possibly near the last one.  St. Charles Mo.  There is a reason it was names (operation Cathedral) LE was sending a message.

            At 36:40 in this video the policeman says -- "A lot of these kids are the equivalent of movie stars. They're famous. They're celebrities. All their pictures are well known. Their abuse will continue for the rest of their life. That documentation of their abuse is going to be part of their life forever."

            I understand all I need to about pedo's and their "look the other way wives" It's like asking people to understand a bear . You don't get into the head of a man that holds you down and rapes you at 8 how could anyone understand keeping an erection while a little girl cries and begs. . Do you really want to understand him? Do you want to know how a man can talk to a little girls parents like he is a friend while secretly stealing their childs soul?  It's a good piece and I don't mean to trash you in anyway but you need to understand a lot of us are hurting and don't care what the sick monsters who hurt us think or feel we just want them stopped

             Understood. However, my point was that many of these people DO NOT consider sex a crime. They have rationalized away the damage, blaming it on puritanical morality. They believe children should have sex just like adults do. This is the definition of their sociopathic mentalities. It was not that many years ago that new brides hid in the bathroom on their wedding nights. Was it "Coalminer's Daughter"? Her husband forced himself on her because she was shy. (I haven't seen the movie for years, but it is how I remember it. Maybe I've mixed it up with another movie.)
            </p>
            <p>
             I've also heard stories that in some South American countries if a girl hadn't lost her virginity by the age of 13 her father raped her to remove her shame. This is hearsay and I need to research it.
            </p>
            <p>
             This crime against innocence is different from robbery or violent assault. It includes the element of pleasure, which in the mind of a sociopath makes it acceptable. This is why -- coming to my point -- that these people are so brazen and shameless. Pleasure is not a crime to them. They put the blame on puritanical morality and not on themselves. And they are addicted just as surely as drug addicts are addicted to heroin. They have become twisted and sick.

              I truly get what you are saying, but my point is, you , can't get into their head . My abuser was a " child like" man in his abuses We played hide and seek, and sang silly songs ,I saw a friend , my parents saw a nice man who was the father of one of my friends .  They are wired differently . By nature or nurture is still being fought but they are different creatures than us

              A father raping her daughter to remove her shame. That is the kinda machismo retard  mentality youll find south of the border.  I believe that does occur. Ive met women who were sexually abused by their fathers and raped as well. It fucked them up for life

               I am still looking for a reference to this practice. I did discover that incest is a serious issue in Latino culture. 95% of girls getting pregnant under 15 were victims of incest.

               the father will use a cloth on a finger to take his daughters virginity, and if it is proven that she is not a virgin she will be stoned to death for her shame --

                There was no "finger" in that passage! The cloth that is being mentioned is the bedding underneath where the marriage was consummated. Obviously the assumption being a virgin will blead, therefore the proof of her virginity will be on the cloth. Did you really need that explained to you? Sheesh! don't make stuff up and don't believe crap on obscure websites!
