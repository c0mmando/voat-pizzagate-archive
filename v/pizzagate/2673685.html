             True, but keep in mind Arizona has a very large population of 55+ with no kids... there are entire giant cities of adults only... no schools, no children... Sun City for example... so seeing a lot of medical in a state full of old people is pretty normal. Most dentist will usually treat children as well. The amount and size of these places specializing in ONLY children seems weird here.

            Just like Glacier Dental in Achorage, Alaska. Terrible reviews. Adrenachrome hotspot.
           </p>
           <p>
            Rumor has it that dentist chairs are ideal for the extraction of Adrenachrome.
           </p>
           <p>
            Look around the area for pet crematorium/hospitals with awful reviews and eye care centers too. Organ harvesters usually have a network nearby.

            Always wondered about dentists, not just for kids, constantly pushing the fluoride.  No better than the medical system, pushing big pharma and somehow always going to Africa for safaris.

            One detail that I have found with these dental/trafficking schemes is that they pick up many kids from schools at the same time using buses and vans. They take the children off of school campus without the parents being present. Parents authorize them to pick the children up ahead of time but once they picked my sibling up without permission. It would be very easy to drug a child and take them somewhere else. As long as there is a dental chair present (Epstein house) the child will think they went to a dentist.
            <br/>
            On an unrelated note,  the dentist that tortured me as a child through one of these type of programs also drove a hummer. Altogether your post hits very close to home for me. Good finds

            If there are dentists and dental technicians practicing dentistry without a license they can get into serious trouble. I wonder if anyone has reported them. Usually people's suspicions  are right.

            I'm from Tucson, yes the swirl is an indian symbol, but it has many swirls while the pedo one has two to do the big little thing. Not sure about the dental thing. We have some of the big places like that and they do suck because they hire dentists right out of school. As soon as they can afford to, they go open their own practice.

            Remember that Glacier Dental place (was it in Wisconsin?) that was super shady that had crematoriums next to the building and storage containers and it had that review from that girl who said they forced her to stay and get dental work done and basically made her stay against her will???!!!  I don’t remember how people found it but 4chan did and it was a definite part of the puzzle

            I don't know if what you found is nefarious or not and I have no opinion on it. We have found some weird connections between dental offices and this pedophile network in the past. But I do know...

            The pedos did not invent these symbols,
            <strong>
             they co-opted them
            </strong>
            just like they did the Swastika. The Swastika can be found on things like Buddhist Temples thousands of years old.
            <strong>
             The pedos adopt these symbols and invert the meaning.

            I was affiliated with the dental industry for many years and it is common in pediatric dentistry to keep the parents out of the operatory because the children behave better and cooperate more when the parents stay out. I know that sounds weird but its true. They also have to hold the children down sometimes, physically, and its just better when the parents stay out. I have seen it many times.

            Not saying you didn't find something nefarious because maybe you did. But these are just details I know.

             Exactly. I have seen the swirl symbol on Indian art. The kids dental places do just seem odd to me... so many of them and so large. The main point about keep the parents in the waiting room and watching kids through the windows... I understand the dentists do not want parents back there.. but from the picture it seems like all dental chairs are lined up with a window in front of each chair, so technically the parents can see other kids too. It just seems like a really odd layout. Every dentist I have been as a child still had individual rooms... it doesnt seem sanitary? See this photo:

              I used to be in the dental business. Some of those dental offices in the Southwest treat tons of Mexicans and they get money from the government to buy equipment. They also get subsidies to treat those people. So, what they do is set up a high volume dental mill. The more people they can run through those chairs the more money they make. They set it up like a cattle chute. Our company loved those offices because they bought TONS of equipment from us.

               That makes sense... I've tried to keep an eye and have never seen cars parked at these at night... Some are on very busy streets so it would be noticeable if something was going on or a bunch of cars parked there. I figured something was up and that makes sense about subsidies etc. They just seem way too big with way too many chairs etc for the amount of children they see. Hopefully the dentists aren't doing anything fishy when they bring those 100s of kids up from Mexico/C.America to have dental work done... still kinda weird the yelp rating about them "being out of sedation gas." That's a crucial element to their business and I just cant see them not having a backup supply? Like McDonalds running out of ketchup.

                Every dental office I ever saw had one of the dental assistants doing all the supply ordering. It is amazing how many different things they order in the course of business. Dental offices run out of stuff on a fairly regular basis because the assistant doing the ordering didn't notice that it needed to be ordered. I have seen them run out of gas, tooth filling material, and everything else you can think of.
