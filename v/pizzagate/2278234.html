            Bitcoin was less than a penny when this guy made his offer for two pizzas.  For your story to work, he had to know that bitcoin would reach its present values. And there's no way he could have known that.  Bitcoin prices have spiked and have dropped in the past.

            Essentially, you are viewing choices made in 2010 through the information you could have only gotten in 2017.

             I happen to agree with this. The value of all the bitcoin in circulation until very recently has not been enough to be used to pay for nefarios and usually expensive things such as organs, drugs or cheese pizza.......

             Bitcoin is a massive waste of energy right now.   Using up more energy than many countries.
            </p>
            <blockquote>
             <p>
              Today, each bitcoin transaction requires the same amount of energy used to power nine homes in the US for one day. And miners are constantly installing more and faster computers. Already, the aggregate computing power of the bitcoin network is nearly 100,000 times larger than the worldâ€™s 500 fastest supercomputers combined.
             </p>
             <p>
              The total energy use of this web of hardware is hugeâ€”an estimated 31 terawatt-hours per year. More than 150 individual countries in the world consume less energy annually. And that power-hungry network is currently increasing its energy use every day by about 450 gigawatt-hours, roughly the same amount of electricity the entire country of Haiti uses in a year.

            supposedly this was actually for two pizzas, it was like $20 in bitcoin at the time. if it wasn't such a famous case, i would be more suspect. i didn't realize it went up so much so quickly, 10x in 5 days, wow.

             It did not go up 10x in five days... it has gone up from around 10k to 14k though and won't stop any time soon.  John McAfee promised if its not over $500,000 in three years, he'll suck himself off on live video..... unfortunately (or fortunately if you own bitcoin), we won't be seeing John sucking himself off :/

             Yeah, I even vaguely remember when the story was reported at the time.  But, after the past 1+ year, I don't take anything at face value.  Almost everything we hear on the news or read from official sources is a lie or a half truth.  Why not a story of buying a beer or uber ride or hamburger or haircut?  Somebody wanted to start the legend of the biggest financial project of the decade over pizza.  Even if no goods changed hands other than a flat Italian pie, the imagery is suspicious.  A dog whistle to the customers?  Telling them that bitcoin would be accepted as payment in (((pizza parlours))), which would make bitcoin worth something.
