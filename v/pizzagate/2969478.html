<p>David Frodsham, discharged from duty due to “sexual harassment” behavior and an assessment by the military that he had an unalterable personality disorder, has been arrested and convicted of operating a pornographic pedophile ring based out of his state-approved foster home. Two-year-old Devani was taken from her home and placed in Frodsham\'s care where she was repeatedly raped and passed around. Frodsham was arrested. Devani was placed into another foster home where she was burned on 80 per cent of her body, which resulted in the amputation of her toes.  Devani lived with her mother, who loved her.

<p>An 18-year-old victim of Frodsham has now come forward detailing how he was imprisoned, tortured, and repeatedly raped and trafficked by him. CPS had evidence of the abuse but did nothing. The victim is now suing, saying:</p>

<p>David Frodsham utilized the State of Arizona and the foster care system to funnel innocent, vulnerable children into his home, so he could run a pedophile ring.</p>
<p>John Doe [victim] was sexually and physically abused by David Frodsham countless times both inside and outside the home while Frodsham’s wife, Barbara witnessed this abuse, and physically abused John Doe herself.</p>
<p>Mr. Frodsham also acted as John Doe’s pimp, prostituting John Doe to other men, for their sexual enjoyment, and for money for himself.
Frodsham often participated in these sexual meetups. Frodsham helped enable a network of pedophiles in the Sierra Vista area and these men participated in further sexual abuse against John Doe.</p>

<p>Why was Frodsham accepted by CPS as a foster parent when he had been thrown out of Afghanistan for sexually abusing boys?</p>
<p>The victim was forced to live outside the home. He was not fed or clothed.  He was beaten by Mrs Frodsham.</p>

            Great post. This needs as much exposure as possible. Hard to read and be aware of, but the only route to vigilance. This link in your article is also telling. Of all the s___ happening on the planet this is the most needful topic.

            Arizona cps has been closed.  They call the new office social services or something.  Everyone got fired.  They are rewriting the policy and procedure manual.  Good !  Arizona is very behind the times. The state was settled by retirees. There was a small pocket of Hispanics south.  In the past decade or so over 100k people have moved there.  Hopefully the new admin will catch up.  The state has become much more liberal.  Not because of the Californians .
            <br/>
            In either case cps admits it’s a matter of supply and demand.  Over worked social employees.  Grab the nearest available parent .............In most courts , judges will not hear or throw out cases against cps based on how over worked they are.  That’s no excuse to me. Citizens must give their children a voice or nothing will change.

             A Rothschild is  Mayor of Tucson. He needs to go or things won’t get better. Tucson is a large trafficking gateway. I am sure he is helping things run smoothly. With no name gone though maybe there is hope.

             It is a question of supply and demand ....
Supply and demand for pedophiles..
Children generate money ...if there is a low supply of children then prices for sexual abuse of children will rise..
To keep prices low there needs to be a controlled supply of children..
Child protection service..
Look up legal defintion of protection under mercwntile law..
The sovereign subsidises the storage of commodities so as to control the internal domestic price of a commodity.
            </p>
            <p>
             So when the Fed privides funds to state run child protectiin serivce ..what they r really doing for the deep state freemaosnic rings that are in every district demanding a suppply of children ...is to subsidise the price for these networks..
            </p>
            <p>
             Its only fair to take care of freemasonic networks and their demands is it not ...Are they not to be rewarded for their hard work in running the deep state debt networks all across the planet and in washington..
            </p>
            <p>
             Its a service to provide protection for the value of the child..Child Protectiin Service..
            </p>
            <p>
             Its all a debt game ...and we r their players wanted to fund this , their debt game ..

            About 30%, if not more, of rescued children from FBI cross country sweeps, are foster kids. Around 20% of the people arrested are foster parents. But good luck trying to get a FOIA request granted, to get the actual FBI stats on this.

              It's for "personal info" reasons, that they refuse to release any stats. Only stats mind you. No one is asking for names of victims. Just want to know the exact number of rescued that were not only runaways from foster care, but were in foster care at the time of the bust.

              I've searched as well. I've been trying to keep a tab on the cross country sweeps the FBI do and I have noticed when articles would mention foster parents busted. I only guesstimate the numbers. I know the FBI flat out refuses any and all FOIA requests involving this info.

               I have seen an uptick in Pedo ring arrests etc but mostly in local media. If this was a concern for Msm or politicians it would be front page. The omission is telling for me.

                Since pizzagate broke, I've been trying to tell people. This is what is called social stress testing. They are gauging societies reaction and slowly normalizing the concept of pedophilia as they bust small fry rings. It's cornering the market.

            I don't want kids (or pets) because I'm such a sucker. I'm TOO nice. I want to PLEASE. They would DESTROY me with their manipulations. I'm autistic, so I'm EASILY, initially deceived. SO many opportunties these days for pets and people to squander ALL of your resources on their interests, regardless of viability. Thanks liberals for the parasitic mindfuck.
