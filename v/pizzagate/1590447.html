            is suggesting the neighborhood playground was used for viewing the goods also, that all the apartments around the park are owned by someone connected , basically the neighborhood is like an international shopping market for kids .

             I complete agree with the playground being a viewing area for kids and Pegasus the viewing platform. They needed to buy up all the surrounding residential properties to create control of the environment. I'm thinking the location was operational for at least 1.5 to 2 years before PG broke in October 2016. This actually creates a pretty large window of evidence and I would not be surprised if the nearby residents have a few interesting accounts of the on-goings at Pegasus.

              Restaurants, homes, park, possibly tunnels &amp; CIA neighbors etc... It seems alot of time , effort &amp; equity went into this pedo ring neighborhood .If they have to dismantle it all they have to be mad.Curious to see if they keep it active.

            Nice hypothesis, my guess was that Pegasus was some kind of pick up/transport station.  This takes it a step further.  Good work!  Remember that CIA and their assets don't really change what they do, just where they do it.

             Thanks. Also, I found the group's 'excitement' about the Pegasus building during construction to be very revealing. It's like they are the only people who knew what they were looking at and they were giddy over holes and trenches. As for the sliding platform interior, Scott Cummings has totally removed all photos of it from his website.  I guess he is not as excited about it, now.
