            i am not sure what you are referring to specifically... but I think it is in reference to 'alters' come out and take over prior to performance. This is either mind control induced 'alters' or demonic possession. Or both. Disassociation is a common side effect of ritual abuse and mind control programming (ala MK Ultra) I also firmly believe that there are demonic forces at play here. They could have all been to the crossroads along with Robert Johnson LOL..... But what do I know... just my impressions. It is certainly not outside of the realm of the current reality we live in.

                 I actually have severe adrenal fatigue. I had severe sciatica for a few years and back problems (until I discoverd Dr.John Sarno and TMS - its all repressed emotions) . I have healed that mostly (except the adrenal fatigue) I work really hard to control my stress reactions. I used to be so solid and steady. I now do QIgong and live in the most beatiful part of the country far far away from everything. I am happier and healthier. Stress can destroy your life. I also owned a restaurant, which is worse. I apparently used to be a masochist. No longer. I am a bit delicate now and carefully control my environment. Nature is the answer. I used to dream of rivers, streams and mountains when I was working 16 hours a day. Now I have that and it is wonderful. Mainstream america can kiss my ass. I am a much happier person now but I stilll carry the scars. I was good at it so I thought it was worth it. No amount of money or travel is worth that level of stress. YOu have to be an actor/imposter every single day of your life doing that work.

                   you know that is funny. about talking to your kids. I do that as a volunteer now. I dont believe in traditional schooling as it brainwashes kids. I am an advoczte of community based home schooling and learning trades vs corporate paper pusher jobs or technology jobs. Figure out your values first. Find your passions first. We live in a rural community with a bunch of farm kids. Many of them want something 'else' or something 'more' than country living. I now volunteer and provide coaching and 'big sister' work. My focus is absolutely about finding your passion. Learn a trade. Develop a skill. embrace what you have (like being the child of a farmer or a cattle rancher) THIS is the types of work/lifestyle that equates to a happy life. But you are right, hindsight is 20/20. I just tell kids my story in that money and career do not equal happiness. Find your passion first. Dont do anything just because society tells you it is right. Find and make your own way in the world and discover your special gifts. I teach art, photography, mushroom &amp; plant identification, foraging, etc... creative pursuits that teach kids about something other than video games, tv and mind control. You would be surprised how many country kids never want to leave the house because of internet and video games. they have no idea how lucky they are..... I am here to tell them. LOL. My career is the reason I dont have kids, and likely it is now too late. Sad but true. Luckily my husband is ok with no kids. But I did lose that opportunity because of all those years of dedication to career. If I did it now I would be one old granny by the time they graduated highschool.

             obviously a picture only provies I was there with him. The NLP stuff was my observation as I used to be in corporate leadership development and I was trained in that (in business at that level it is a standard) The wine was referring to Bill Coby not clinton. That was BEFORE the cosby alllegations of drugging women came out.  I was not surprised AT ALL. due to my experience. MY point is there are alot of fucking sick fucks in powerful positions in the world and people worship evil people without knowing anything about them. I have seen alot.

            Can you tell us more about how Bill Clinton was an expert in hypnotic suggestion? How do you know? Also, if you worked for Obama, you said he's a dark eyed fuck. What happened that makes you say that? Can you share that picture you mentioned?

              I did READ. You said "I had to get special clearance to work with Clinton and Obama. I organized for Obama twice...pre and post election." Why so defensive?? Ok worked WITH instead of FOR. Is that worded better for you?

                 how so? because I have been places and seen things that many havent? My issues are the same as the rest of us... being controllled by psychopaths. I just know more about how things actually work than the average person. It is dicks like you that make me hesitate to share things. Keep it moving buddy.. you know not what you say.

                  No. I'm talking about how you acted over the wording of my question. Now, you throw out your narcissistic comments about what you've been thru, as if people are jealous of you. If you're gonna be a wench, then don't share. Who cares? It's not like we know if you're telling the truth, or even if that pic is really you. "Keep it moving buddy...You know not what to say".  What the hell is that about? Oh and I'm a dick now too. I'm not ven male 🤔

                   well  i am already getting attacked for sharing...and i know no one cares. Why would they? Who cares if no one believes me. Anyone who isnt respectful at this point will get that from me. I hav had enough and if it is relevant to anyone that is up to them. None of this is even relevant to the discussion... they are just experiences and observations. Take it for what it is worth, otherwise move along. Works for me... I do it every day.

              It does say enticement. That would mean he tried to entice her to meet for sex. But either way hes fucked.

            I used to be an event planner and organized speaking engagements. I had to get special clearance to work with Clinton and Obama - I organized for Obama twice...pre and post election. He was a dark eyed fuck. I could tell you a lot. But what was interesting was Clinton's secret service. They were all very good looking and very sexually predatory. At least 3 of my catering girls had sex with secret service agents. They took them all to strip clubs and got them drunk. One felt she was raped. It was a fiasco. She quit as a result. They were like a pack of wolves. I did not complain but I wanted to. Bill was an expert at hypnotic suggestion NLP and commands a room. I have a picture with him as proof of you don't believe me. Funny thing about that time is Monica Lewinsky lived in my city.  She worked on advertising. I went to lunch with her via some friends who knew her. She was very worried about being in the same city as Bill and took a leave of absence while he was in town. She seemed terrified and unwilling to talk about it. I never saw her again. It was all strange. And don't get me started on the pig Bill Cosby. He offered to pay me to dance for him in his green room post show. He offered me wine. I told him no and left the room but I was shaking with fear. He scared the shot out of me
 I would only let the guys take care of his hospitality service after that. So many of the 'famous' people are evil pigs.

              smell like sulpher? not that I know of? strange question. I am talking about darkness in the eyes. A change in appearance. Have you never seen this in anyone? Psychopaths do it all the time. So do those that have 'alters'. They change. I noticed it and i didnt know anything about that stuff then.

               Look up the obama and hillary smell like sulphur by secret service agents online.  They think they are demon possessed.  I was just wondering by your dark eyed comment. Iam familiar with the behavior and mannerism of psychopaths but usually they are so keen at looking normal which is what they strive for that it is interesting you noticed this in obummer. I believe he is

                i didnt know about the sulphur. that could be a byproduct of cannibalism. or evil. i actually just think he is mind controlled. they differences are so vast from one moment to the next. I have always been a good observer of human behavior and he was a total anomaly to me. He is controlled and I think he has alters. It makes sense knowing what I know now. I wish I would have smelled him LOL.  Bill didnt smell. I was up close and personal and I wanted to like him. Even though I didnt.... I found it odd howe good he was and drawing people in.. better than anyone i have ever seen in my life. I did ask him one question: Do you have any regrets from your time as president? He said Rwanda. He could have done more. Then he repeated that in his Q&amp;A..so obviously that was a canned response. I thought that was interesting.

                  I know he is. Remember that video clip from Kissinger in the 80's referring to him? I will see if I can find it....i know it still exists but is hard to find. I have seen it. i found this reference
                  <a href="https://fellowshipoftheminds.com/2015/03/16/kissinger-obamas-task-is-to-create-a-new-world-order/">

                  In 2011…I found a video which was about 1-2 hours long and Henry Kissinger was talking to a man name unknown – Kissinger said to this man “we are grooming a young man to be president one day his name is Barack Obama”. This was said during the 1980 convention…. My mouth fell wide open. This would have made Obie about 19-20 years old. Kissinger was wearing a mustard yellow v neck sweater with shirt and tie. Common dress for the 1980’s. I saved the video to my youtube and I saved it as well to my videos on my computer. It is gone. No where to be found. Everything is planned. It is all evil…..

                    TOTALLY true. He was really into the girls on the team and was very very flirty. When we took the pic he held me closer than he should have and for just a little longer than he needed to. That is how it is... most of the women LOVED It. Slick willy is the perfect nickname.

                     Yes. Roger Stone calls him a serial rapist and a biter (on the mouth) ... I've known for a long time he's a sex addict. As they say, the biggest part of Bill Clinton is his ... that's what he's in it for mainly.

                      sounds about right. I know he was 15 minutes late going on stage and the organizers were FREAKING OUT. He wanted to spend time with us backstage chatting and taking pictures before he went on. He could give a shit if people were waiting. As an organizer it made me anxious but I found it curious and thought he was just really appreciating all of our hard work. It was mostly cute girls on our team. He took his time with each of us... he LOVES the admiration. He barely looked at or spoke to either of the 2 guys on the team.

                        not sure what that means really. But I do know that the average person is starstruck VERY easily. That is true. Once you have seen enough it is the opposite. Lots of girls hooked up with people after event gigs. I never did. Which is likely why I was management. I used to have a famous boyfriend when i was in my early 20's. A very well known reggae artist. That pretty much cured me after a few months of touring with him. We are still friends to this day, 23 years later. We are both married now but have a great friendship. Groupies are Gross. ( I met him through a mutual friend so it was not a groupie hook up... he was very very nice to me) there were just women hiding behind every corner ready to get down. it gets old and they seem desperate.

                         Thanks, yeah I just meant groupies as in those who follow rock bands, didn't mean you. And yeah you can get pretty "un" star struck once you meet them. My folks met Woody Allen and said he was dirty and disgusting, dunno. lol  And I've met a few.

                actually... not exactly. He seemed like he had superhuman powers to command a room and everyone in it. The elite of our city were slobbering like hungry dogs just to be in the same room with him. Lined up for pictures like sheep and paid ALOT of money to be at this private reception. They all got photos etc. Just as he was about to go on stage he made sure to get pictures with each of us because we took care of him and his crew all day. he was quite magnetic.... but then Icontinued to watch him and when I got next to him he re directed my attention from him to a button I was wearing. It was hard to decribe but slick as shit. I knew he was skilled at handling people but unfortunetly he was VERY liekable and went to great lengths on an individual basis to connect. He is a master. Obama on the other hand is a FAKE. He turns on and off at will. His eyes when no one is watching were DARK and scary. His energy was awrful, until he stepped on stage or in front of the press. That  was pre-election adn I knew at that moment he was evil. You could feel it. I didnt vote for him and didnt like him and my friends and family thought I was crazy. I was right. TO this day no one believes me with the stories I tell from those 2 days I spent with him (one pre election and one post election) That guys radiates darkness. Bill wasnt so transparent. Everyone loves him, he cultivates that.

                  mostly observations. that smile he puts on is fake as fuck for the public. behind the scenes he is very different. secretive. dark. He steps on stage and becomes ANOTHER PERSON. That is why I think he is manchurian/MK'd.   He has handlers. For sure. I wish I would have paid more attention to the names of the handlers but it was a long time ago and I wasnt fully woke yet. This led to getting woke. For sure. In the "comand room"  is where the real happens (green room I was responsible for stocking/staffing) Only management level planners can be present. All most have secret service clearance in advance of events.  Other observations had to do with body language, eating habits and general stuff that struck me as odd. Nothing relevant unless you were there to witness. I already expose myself personally by sharing this (not that it matters much) but I really am not in the mood to deal with attacks from shills on irrellevant observations. Already getting pm'd stupidity. Listen, I could give a shit if anyone believes me and how important is my tiny experience anyways??? (at least to the big picture) these are anecdotes to you guys, and experiences for me. I actually have ALOT more dirt I could share on my work in the Executive LEadership Development program administrator years. I worked for CFR/Globalists and traveled the world with them doing "globalization" work and leadership p rograms. FOrtune 50 companies. Right before the banking crisis and just after 2001. I have met and been in the room with every single CEO of every single company that eventually went down. This is how they determine who is down with the NWO program and who isnt. This is how they share information and obtain the goals they wish to achieve. THAT stuff is where the real meat is... but I am still afraid to talk to much about it for fear of revealing myself fully. I quit because it made me sick once I figured it out. 9/11 red pilled me but it still took time to figure out how all this stuff fit into the bigger picture. I can give you ONE name to look at if you ever want to know where the NWO are headed. That name is Stephen Rhinesmith. They scurbbed all traces of the company partnership that I worked for...it was dissolved somewhere around 2008 after the work was done. As a result of working in this industry and traveling the world for 5 years I know more than most and have for a very long time. It involved all the major industries Banking, Pharmaceutical, Consumer Products and Healthcare... special emphasis on banking. If you look at Rhinesmiths current focus you will know who we are jacking next.  I signed an NDA and received a large cash settlement when I quit. Who does that? They know I know. Period. I wish I could elaborate more but I did sign that agreement so I am vulnerable.

              in relation to these guys or in general? if in general i could tell LOTS of stories... but not related to this thread. I would go to another sub for that....if it was relevant. Its not.  I have worked with TONS of famous people. They are mostly idiots or rude. Lots of stripper stories, drug stories, funny stories... etc the little  details about the people above arent really important beyond what I shared and even those are just observations. The one exception to the jerk-off rule was Harry Connick Jr. He was the nicest of them all. A true gentleman. Some funny stories and anecdotes but nothing anyone would really care about or find useful.

                  dont know about any of that directly.  not surprised.... i know about how much he loves cocaine from different things I have read. He did not drink any alcohol at the reception. Just soda water. I have read Huma has a lesbian relationship with Hillary but who the fuck knows. gross to even think about. I dont know much, just my own observations for those brief periods of time. Anecdotes really.... not important.

            Time to remind people that the Franklin Coverup Scandal alleged that the secret service were complicit and operating while the President and officials were attending child sex parties.
Quite possibly epstein's Lolita island as well if I recall correctly, although I heard Clinton might have also have been dodgeying his detail while enjoying the "festivities".
