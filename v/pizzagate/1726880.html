            Hillary made a visit to make sure that everything was running just fine and dandy.  All those trips she made while SOS where not just to collect spoons.  Her visits are highly suspect.

            <p>
             "Those arrested included the owners of the clinics, midwives, doctors, owners of the charities, as well as court clerks"
