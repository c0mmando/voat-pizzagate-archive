<p>It is about a children\'s book with the main subject being secret pizza parties. Disgusting book, good video. 15:20 in they show a &quot;Pizza Party&quot; play-doh box set which I notice has a pedo symbol at the bottom. So from the Hasbro website I was able to grab a photo with decent resolution...</p>

<p>The symbol at the bottom of the box is some kind of certification from the TUVReinland corp.  I searched through images of all other play-doh box sets and was only able to find this symbol on the &quot;Pizza Party&quot; box. </p>
<p>Who is TUV Reinland?  I haven\'t dug in yet but from all appearances they look like a globalist corp with their tentacles in everything.

<p>I don\'t know if the pizza related connections are just coincidental or not. Just wanted to share.</p>',
