<p>It is about a children\'s book with the main subject being secret pizza parties. Disgusting book, good video. 15:20 in they show a &quot;Pizza Party&quot; play-doh box set which I notice has a pedo symbol at the bottom. So from the Hasbro website I was able to grab a photo with decent resolution...</p>

<p>I don\'t know if the pizza related connections are just coincidental or not. Just wanted to share.</p>',
