<h1><strong>Why Should You Care?</strong></h1>
<p>The first reason Pizzagate should be of interest to everyone in the world because of the way the USA is treating the topic; Censorship. Misinformation. Hired Internet shills. Disinformation. Attempts to infiltrate. Death threats. And Worse.</p>
<p>The second reason is that, through the lens of Pizzagate, it can be deduced that the average person is being lied to about the level of corruption within our governments. All of our governments.</p>
<p>The most immediate reason everyone should be concerned is because slavery is alive and well in the world and it can only flourish with the cooperation of government officials and the media. Forced labor. Domestic servitude. Sexual Servitude. Political servitude. And Worse.</p>

<h1><strong>On The Scent</strong></h1>
<p>For many people, Pizzagate is a jumping off point. It started with spirit cooking, the pizza code and the Instagram account of jimmycomet. However, these accusations have been around for a long time.</p>
<p>Andrew Breitbart accused John Podesta, specifically, of running an underage sex slave operation: <a href="https://sli.mg/PFG356.jpg">https://sli.mg/PFG356.jpg</a></p>
<p>Guccifer attributed his work to the personal mission to reveal that Hillary Clinton and others were occult ritualists who were sacrificing children: <a href="https://sli.mg/zy0czt.jpg">https://sli.mg/zy0czt.jpg</a></p>
<p>There is something so concerning that people have been dedicating their lives, even in the face of imprisonment and death, to attempt to bring the truth to the light of day. Whatever you believe about what goes on in the basement of Comet Ping Pong, the money trail still leads back to human trafficking in 100 different ways.</p>
<p>Let\'s follow the trail of the average Pizzagate Investigator:</p>
<p>Spirit Cooking: <a href="https://sli.mg/5tqDrg.jpg">https://sli.mg/5tqDrg.jpg</a> <a href="https://sli.mg/DnRcTx.png">https://sli.mg/DnRcTx.png</a> <a href="https://sli.mg/u6ZJ8q.jpg">https://sli.mg/u6ZJ8q.jpg</a> <a href="https://sli.mg/nrupF4.jpg">https://sli.mg/nrupF4.jpg</a> </p>

<p>Satanic Pizza Pedophilia: <a href="https://sli.mg/M2bOUw.png">https://sli.mg/M2bOUw.png</a> <a href="https://sli.mg/EsQtOu.png">https://sli.mg/EsQtOu.png</a> <a href="https://sli.mg/cxPZrn.jpg">https://sli.mg/cxPZrn.jpg</a> </p>
<p>Convicted Pedophiles: <a href="https://sli.mg/ddFwzS.jpg">https://sli.mg/ddFwzS.jpg</a></p>
<p>That was enough for most people to be convinced that the Podestas and James Alefantis are 100% confirmed to be hanging around and being supportive of convicted pedophiles, have a penchant for art involving pedophilia and known symbology from pedophile culture and that they cast spells by writing on the wall with blood.</p>
<p>James Alefantis immediately reacted by calling everyone racist, homophobic before switching to \'conspiracy theorist.\' Insults without addressing the evidence. Trump supporters were treated exactly the same way, watching the media “swiftboat” Trump 24 hours a day, while being called homophobic and racist. People are tired of \'victim status\' being used as a shield against common sense. So, the investigation digs in.</p>
<p>Immediately, it is revealed that <strong>Alefantis is connected to David Brock, who works with Hillary Clinton to astroturf the Internet</strong> by paying people to post pro-Hillary comments, infiltrate Trump groups to create concern, anxiety and doubt, and to insult people on the Internet, if they disagree with Hillary. It is part of their script.</p>
<p>Now, the Pizzagate investigators have zeroed in on a media machine that is, apparently, connected to all of this protected political pedophilia. <strong>Maybe even at the heart of it.</strong></p>
<p>The reason you have so much confusing information regarding Pizzagate is, one, there is so much damning evidence that it is impossible to sum up in a single post. Two, <strong>Correct the Record and similar organizations have infiltrated investigating groups to intentionally insert false leads to discredit the movement.</strong></p>
<p>People have been trained to trust the media and avoid looking at primary sources. However, the primary sources that have been leaked over the last couple of years overwhelmingly reveal <strong>a massive web of organized crime of a type that is difficult to comprehend</strong> without digging through it, yourself.</p>
<h1><strong>Welcome To The Investigation</strong></h1>
<p>Being able to reproduce your trail of evidence so that other people can make the same conclusions is supremely important.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Know your leaks: Wikileaks, Offshore Leaks, DC Leaks, Guccifer, Cryptome.org</p>

<h1><strong>What About The Human Trafficking Connections?</strong></h1>
<p>Here are a lot of leads: <a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1466894">https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1466894</a></p>
<p>What we are looking at, though, are political NGO\'s (like the Clinton Foundation or American Security Council Foundation) that pretend to be charities, but actually are only designed to cut deals with whoever is necessary in order to help mining interests extract raw materials from the earth.</p>
<p><a href="https://lmgtfy.com/?q=human+trafficking+mining">https://lmgtfy.com/?q=human+trafficking+mining</a></p>
<p>What we see is that these mining operations that the Clinton Foundation are involved in ALL REQUIRE SLAVES. aka Forced Human Labor. Frank Giustra. Marc Rich. VCS Mining. Uranium One. Glencore.</p>
<p>There are a lot of illegal activities that use the same exact infrastructure to funnel people across the world for the purposes of slavery. Pimps. Pedophiles. Construction contractors. People are willing to pay for people and sellers don\'t care what it is for.</p>
<p>How does Comet Ping Pong tie in to human trafficking? Other than seemingly participating in the pedophilia, Alefantis has a web of small businesses to launder money through. He is breaking down larger sums of money to disguise the source. He sells crappy satanic art through Transformer and other fronts far above their value. All of their money is flowing through each other. George Soros, Podestas, the Kremlin, the Clinton Foundation, Saudi Arabia, Qatar... the list goes on and on. The financial web is the most revealing because it suggests that there is a lot more to this than just having sex with kids.</p>
<p>That is why everyone needs to keep investigating.</p>
<p><strong>The manipulation of public perception has occurred on a massive scale to convince people they need to be worried about conflicts that have nothing to do with solving the basic problem of eliminating slavery.</strong></p>
<p>Pizzagate is a window into how the \'elite\' utilize the media and government apparatus to distract, confuse and help people forget what is important.</p>
<p>Pizzagate is a window into the existential crisis of humankind; organizing a society without slavery.</p>
<p>Please, keep raising awareness. Please, keep investigating.</p>
<p>The pieces are coming together.</p>',

            What About The Human Trafficking Connections?
           </strong>
          </h1>
          <p>
           Here are a lot of leads:
           <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/v/pizzagate/1466894">
            https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1466894
           </a>
          </p>
          <p>
           What we are looking at, though, are political NGO's (like the Clinton Foundation or American Security Council Foundation) that pretend to be charities, but actually are only designed to cut deals with whoever is necessary in order to help mining interests extract raw materials from the earth.
          </p>
          <p>
           <a href="https://lmgtfy.com/?q=human+trafficking+mining">
            https://lmgtfy.com/?q=human+trafficking+mining
           </a>
          </p>
          <p>
           What we see is that these mining operations that the Clinton Foundation are involved in ALL REQUIRE SLAVES. aka Forced Human Labor. Frank Giustra. Marc Rich. VCS Mining. Uranium One. Glencore.
          </p>
          <p>
           There are a lot of illegal activities that use the same exact infrastructure to funnel people across the world for the purposes of slavery. Pimps. Pedophiles. Construction contractors. People are willing to pay for people and sellers don't care what it is for.
          </p>
          <p>
           How does Comet Ping Pong tie in to human trafficking? Other than seemingly participating in the pedophilia, Alefantis has a web of small businesses to launder money through. He is breaking down larger sums of money to disguise the source. He sells crappy satanic art through Transformer and other fronts far above their value. All of their money is flowing through each other. George Soros, Podestas, the Kremlin, the Clinton Foundation, Saudi Arabia, Qatar... the list goes on and on. The financial web is the most revealing because it suggests that there is a lot more to this than just having sex with kids.
          </p>
          <p>
           That is why everyone needs to keep investigating.
          </p>
          <p>
           <strong>
            The manipulation of public perception has occurred on a massive scale to convince people they need to be worried about conflicts that have nothing to do with solving the basic problem of eliminating slavery.
           </strong>
          </p>
          <p>
           Pizzagate is a window into how the 'elite' utilize the media and government apparatus to distract, confuse and help people forget what is important.
          </p>
          <p>
           Pizzagate is a window into the existential crisis of humankind; organizing a society without slavery.
          </p>
          <p>
           Please, keep raising awareness. Please, keep investigating.

The founder of Pizza Fest is a satanist as well.

            New to this pizzagate thing. I saw some mentions of it on Reddit, then saw it massively censored, which got me curious. This is a well sourced post. Do you mind if I share it outside of voat?

            Arrington de Dionyso is marginally more talented than Marina Abramovic.  He does have the ability to paint simplistic renditions of naked people with slightly better results than a first-timer would achieve.

            Shitty art though.

            Hi guys, this could be an important part of this world wide paedophile ring. Just noticed this sign near my home, with the international paedophiles symbol (like a triangle) YWCA Jesmond House, in Newcastle Upon Tyne, England (Clayton Road, Newcastle Upon Tyne NE2 1UJ ) 
This building is in an affluent part of the city, and is a hostel that caters for vulnerable single people and recently released prisoners. Check out the symbol at the top of their web site
            <a href="http://www.neywca.co.uk/jesmond-house.php">
             http://www.neywca.co.uk/jesmond-house.php
            </a>
            Interestingly this place was opened by H.R.H. Princess Alexandrea on 27 sept 1984.
 This is the sign I seen from the street

            </a>
            I Pray and Hope someone with more know-how then me be able to dig some more, little children could be at risk now.Thank you. 
I would also like to thank Victurus Libertas VL, for recently making this video about this matter

            Please look into this: An (alleged, although he's proving it in the 1. part) insider exposing the cult, which we investigate now as #pizzagate. His stuff sounds reasonable for anybody that is familiar with the topic, but its very tough for somebody that's not. So, please be open minded.

            Nice, I've passed the link here on, I've been mostly sharing the wp site and I share this place with those I know don't think I've completely lost it. I make sure to add, PG is but the tip, the root of it all is what we're trying to yank out so everyone can see. Deep roots, so I tell people bring shovels and prepare to start diggin it out. Think of it as a diseased tree, cutting it down, leaves a stump, an ugly stump, you'd rather they get the roots so you can put something nice in it's place. Truth is the nice that I'd like to put in it's place, and transparency to keep it a growin' tall. We shouldn't have to distrust our government.
           </p>
           <p>
            I'm blessed that most of my friends know I don't willy nilly go believing everything I read, many ask if I've read anything of interest. You can find truth among the theories yourself, picking and choosing which to believe based on evidence. While most wont dig with me, because of it's nature, they ARE helping get the truth out. I print facts like what's in here, the most compelling. I leave the print offs in random areas...every toilet stall...even carts. I hated going shopping before, but putting it out there like that, there's going to be a few curious people, at least. I saw that churches were bringing in pamphlets and what not and decided, hm why not leave pamphlets too? We are curious by our very nature.
           </p>
           <p>
            Curiosity got the best of me, and here I am. I wasn't going to do anything but just look at things posted here. Now I'm searching for things myself, and doing so much reading that my eyes get sore. It's hard to put down the internet now, before I had to step back often through the day. Not growing a tolerance to the disgusting things I've learned but disgusted to the point of acting on it. Getting the word out in ways that aren't side eyed, is good, very good. The song and dance they're doing to cover it has now piqued curiousity of those that had ignored it previously. Hell, the Megyn Kelly interview made people gasp, because they SAW the body language. If only websleuths folks would c'mon over and share their knowledge of that end, the true crime community would be in a complete uproar too. Before long they can't call everyone else crazy when they're standing alone in their own puddle of LIES.

           <p>
            Read the tweets again.  He accused Podesta of covering up a sex slave operation, not running it.  Podesta is the media guy and the damage control guy.  This is called in the biz 'a fixer'.

            One thing I've found is that D. Corydon Hammond, the professor/psychiatrist/psychoanalyst who originally discovered the Satanic ritual abuse programming in his MPD/DID patients (in the 90s) tends to be very convincing, it seriously redpilled me.

            jozsefkacsa3 weeks ago The Scary shit about "Gyuri" Soros, is that he's 87 yrs old, but he have people Basically "Coned" with his DNA, and Genealogy, so they can Harvest Major Organs and Organ Systems, growing in the Bodies of Healthy, purchased Slave Children, and when Georgie, needs a New Liver, a New Kidney, in every 2-5 yrs they're just Murder (Humanely) one of these Children or Young Human Specimen. There's a Private Sanatorium , in a Remote and Extremely High Security Castle,in Siklos Hungary used to e owned, by Count &amp; Countess Szechenyi on the Beautiful,Mount Siklos. I know a Cousin of min who runs his Brother in Law's Security Firm and he was looking after, one section of the Castle where he, was the Foreman for 20-25 Security Agent's in 3 Shifts, This Cousin of my was a seriously highly tRained Professional Soldier and then Officer in the, Hungarian Armed Forces, for 20 yrs or so. Anyway he told me Good old Georges shows up every 2-3 months and they replace every drop of his Blood in about 3-5 days. He will receive Organ Transplan Surgeries ever 3-5 yrs, once they established the DNA and Genes in these Children or Young Man Specimen, and grow Soros' DNA in thei bodies , the Organs are, the same as his so there are no chance for rejection! He also receives billions of Stem Cell therapy monthly etc! That is why he's so healthy.You ppl might think I'm a FUCKED UP Conspiracy Theorist, but because what my COZ told me, i know this is true! My Coz is a real, straight up Dude and does not lie! He's still sick and a shame FOR HE WAS WORKING IN THE SZECHENYI Castle for Soros and could hardly live with himself,especially haunt him the Bodies of dead Children after they were used and Abused! He quit couple yrs ego!﻿

            He's a weirdo for sure and probably a satanist who hides behind appropriated culture references from Hinduism and Greek Mythology. I did a post a few days ago about one of his music videos where he sings about drinking blood and sperm.

            will show you how to investigate the tax and fec documentation of privately traded companies, and 501c3 organizations.  Most will fully report their money trail because they are assuming nobody will read it.

            is amazing for determining who donated to which politicians.
           </p>
           <p>
            I also advise you to learn how to use Microsoft Office Access, or Open Office base.  Excel is fine, but base is a relational database tool.  "RELATIONAL" it's designed for what we are doing.

            I wonder how many generations have passed that believed in the morality of the human spirit could become morality for those who have any governance. There is so little morality in politics, if someone can get away with this shit in public, imagine how much worse things are in private. This seems to be so integrated into our lives we cannot comprehend it's vastness. This abuse is astounding, the ability to control not only the populace, but the narrative, and have us so blinded that even seeing it, we deny it. Wasn't MKULTRA about brainwashing people into super soldiers?

             Mk Ultra was the prescursor to being able to create a Manchurian Candidate.
            </p>
            <p>
             A split personality that could be triggered back and forth.
            </p>
            <p>
             Multiple personality is real. Rare is a two personality split, but Tavistock began to study the troops returning from war to learn people's breaking point.
            </p>
            <p>
             Eventually, they learned that trauma, combined with drugs, like scopolamine, and hypnosis techniques could be used to split someone's personality.
            </p>
            <p>
             Mostly, you get broken people. Useless.
            </p>
            <p>
             If you torture enough of them, you will eventually get a person who can survive the split, operate in society as a functional person, and then be triggered, once they are in a strategic position.
            </p>
            <p>
             Still, you need to have them in a position where they believe you have total control over them. What better than aliens, satanic cults and lizard people? These are convenient fictions to control the slaves and ensure any testimony in court makes them seem crazy.

             I know the satanic stuff appears loosely connected at first glance.  I know that it makes us look crazy.  And, I also know that attacking the finances is the best method to taking these people down.
            </p>
            <p>
             But, understanding the motive assists in following the method.  Please do not undermine that line of thought too much, but also do not let others run too far a field with what appears to be loose conjecture either.
            </p>
            <p>
             (I've seen the satanic connections, but they have not been properly illustrated to the portion of the group which finds it a stretch.  That is on us, not you to correct.  To bad I'm really bad at explaining things.)

              What if the satanic rituals are a coverup for organ harvesting?  Or just another page in the blackmail folder.

               Both are valid ideas, and should be considered for investigation.  But, we have located in podesta emails signs of the acult which lines with satanism.  So, out of the three we are running with that one till we either run out of leads there, or are proven incorrect.  But, to tell the truth all of these should be considered and probably all have as much grounds for consideration at this point.  (Organ harvesting goes on in china, could be happening here.  Blackmail is a well known tool in the kit of politics.  And, the emails point to satanic rituals.  All have about the same level of suspicion in my books.)

             Soros is Jewish.  Epstein is Jewish.  Roman Polanski is Jewish.  Jimmy Seville is Jewish.  Corey Feldman is Jewish.  The Hollywood paedophile rings are Jewish.  And many many more.

             Here's the first Satanic band called Coven.

             They're also the band that started using the devil horn hand gesture.

             Well guess what, their producer Bill Traut was Jewish, as were at least two of the band members.

             Guess what else? He wrote songs for them including a 13 min black mass.
            </p>
            <p>
             "The album concluded with a 13-minute track of chanting and Satanic prayers called "Satanic Mass" (written by their producer, Bill Traut, of Dunwich Productions, and described as "the first Black Mass to be recorded, either in written words or in audio")."

             So now I've just proven that Jews started the Satanic music scene, which isn't surprising considering the fact that Satanic occultists are primarily Jews.
            </p>
            <p>
             I'm still going to do more research into all this, but I already know what's up. Jews are Satanists. Jews worship the devil. The Torah Jews are the common Jews which listen to the Rabbis that study the Talmud (Rabbinical Judaism) and the top Rabbis are selected to study Khaballism, which is Satanism.
            </p>
            <p>
             The Torah Jews are puppets to the Talmudists who are puppets to the Khaballists. Jews are Satanic.
            </p>
            <p>
             I'm not religious, but look what Jesus said, who was a Jew btw.
            </p>
            <p>
             " You belong to your father, the devil, and you want to carry out your father's desires. He was a murderer from the beginning, not holding to the truth, for there is no truth in him. When he lies, he speaks his native language, for he is a liar and the father of lies."
            </p>
            <p>

              http://biblehub.com/john/8-44.htm
             </a>
            </p>
            <p>
             Ignoring all this religious stuff, the fact still remains that Jews invented Satanic music and the majority of Satanists are Jews.
            </p>
            <p>
             Now here's a lead for you guys to investigate. The singer of Coven Jinx Dawson gave an interview where she admits her family is involved in the occult and politics and even names them.
            </p>
            <p>
             <a href="http://popcultureaddict.com/interviews/jinxdawson/">
              http://popcultureaddict.com/interviews/jinxdawson/
             </a>
            </p>
            <p>
             She ultimately says that her Grandfather was a Free Mason and it's common knowledge that Free Masonry is a front for Judaism. I can show you statements made by both Rabbis and Masons where they admit that Free Masonry is based upon Judaism.
            </p>
            <p>
             Let's take a look at their lyrics now.
            </p>
            <p>
             " Infants' flesh they did offer For the prince to devour. Covens join, all combine, Powers strong, thoughts align. "
            </p>
            <p>
             " The cheif of the circle, Known as Malchius drank the blood of a young baby Offered unto him. "
            </p>
            <p>
             Malchus is a servant to a Jewish high priest.

             Mkultra is a dangerous topic because much of what we know about is the techniques that don't work.  Thus a casual reader would think anyone talking about it is nuts.

              The truth is never a dangerous topic when the context is relevant. No one believed the crazies who tried to talk about MKULTRA, because no one believed anything that scale or insanity could be protected for decades, while it was. This child abuse has been talked about for my entire life, from all over the fucking world and it is still beyond what anyone can accept as valid truth, or at least valid. Don't ask people to censor themselves, but to think for themselves.

               Which is extracted from the plant Datura Stramonium. If anyone cared to check. It is reported ,this plant was used in the middle ages by witches. Along with a mixture of belladonna and a few others. The hallucinations as reported in the vaults of euriwid, will definitely take you to another land.

             Yeah, I think keep it as it is for now. Once people have become curious that there could be something more to this, they'll investigate a bit, see how real it is, and then their minds will be more open to that stuff, I think you don't want to overload people with too much at once that might make them close off and run away.

             Grooming and gas lighting a civilization is another issue, though still connected. Pizzagate is a spoke in the wheel of human trafficking, most vehicles have four wheels and a chassis.

             Nope. False flag lone gunmen have to come from somewhere. They don't just happen at random.
