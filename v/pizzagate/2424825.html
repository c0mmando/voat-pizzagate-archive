            Thank you for this post,

            . It is certainly worthwhile to remember and to look into these incidents.
           </p>
           <p>
            I would like to ask you to edit and also to add some info, please.
           </p>
           <h1>
           </h1>
           <p>
            The headline could be confusing for readers outside of the US who are not familiar with the incidents at Waco and Ruby Ridge. Also, it is not clear whether 'they' refers to the residents of Waco and Ruby Ridge, or ' group(s) operating within the Federal government'.
           </p>
           <p>
            Remember, the Waco residents were accused of sexual abuse, but later it was claimed that they were innocent, but a CIA group (according to one theory) was involved in drug trafficking and human trafficking.  --
           </p>
           <h1>
           </h1>
           <p>
            Please add a paragraph at the top of the post and explain what happened at Waco and Ruby Ridge. You might want to add links to Wikipedia pages.
           </p>
           <p>
            'That's why people were involved with both operations' - please make clear what exactly you mean by 'people' - the same sniper, the same government employees, the same politicians?
           </p>
           <p>
            '...used by the IC to traffic various things (drugs, people etc.)' - please add 'allegedly', you also might want to link to an article or a previous Voat post (searchvoat.co =&gt; will turn up old threads).
           </p>
           <p>
            'The allegation of sex with children came after the raid had begun.' - please add who was accused of sexual abuse
           </p>
           <p>
            'They didn't because they weren't concerned with the safety of the children they assumed that the raid would be an easy by the book affair.' - please add 'imo'
           </p>
           <p>
            'Pic related, the FBI did that to children with their CS gas:' - please add 'very graphic' or a 'trigger warning'
           </p>
           <p>
            Thank you! :-)
           </p>
