<blockquote>
<p>We all know Carole as the chef of Buck\'s Fishing and Camping, and also from Comet Ping Pong, but how did she get to where she is now?</p>
<p>Carole was born in Manhattan, and lived in suburban New York until she was ten, when she moved to the Washington, DC area. Attending high school at W. T. Woodson, she then went to the University of Richmond where she got her B.A. in Political Science. She bumped around graduate school and law school, working on various statewide and national politcal campaigns, before becoming disenchanted with the whole thing, realizing that art and music were the aesthetics that allowed her to sleep at night.</p>
<p><strong>She had attended Blue Lake and Interlochen music camps in Michigan, and to this day plays the piano and double bass</strong> (!). At the University of Richmond, she studied sculpture with Demetrios Mavroudis, subsequently continuing her studies at Corcoran. She was a member of Margaret Boozer\'s seminar at Red Dirt Studios in Mount Rainier.</p>

<p>So the story begins with Mark Toigo, a trusted friend and co-conspirator, who tried and tried to talk me into buying all of his tomatoes at the end of the season to make the pizza sauce.</p>
<p>My table is very atypical of my beloved city, Washington, D.C. Often, <strong>the uninitiated</strong> Washingtonian doesn\'t want to bask in the tables communal glow. They think they would prefer the &quot;privacy&quot; of a separate table. And so, <em>it\'s magic cannot become theirs. Sometimes I use my power to create new communities.</em> At my table I have fed and sat with the monks sent by <strong>The Dalai Llama</strong> to create the healing mandala at <strong>The Sackler Gallery after September 11th.</strong> During that day, my son and I went to the gallery to watch them meticulously place grains of sand in complex patterns, working with the knowledge that the elaborate sculpture would eventually be swept up and thrown into The Potomac River.</p>
