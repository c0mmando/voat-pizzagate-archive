<p>Spirit Cooking showed that Podesta, Hillary, and their friends were interested in \'art\' which was obviously Satanic in nature (go watch the videos).   Once you understand the occult interest and practices, the Satanic ritualistic sexual abuse of children isn\'t an unexpected consequence.</p>
<p>Marina Abramovic was asked in a Reddit AMA if there was a difference between art and ritual.  She explained that it depends on the context.  Museum it is art.  Presumably at Tony Podesta\'s house it was a ritual.</p>
<p>Then there\'s the bizarre art collection of Tony Podesta.  Since removed, WaPo mentioned that the Podesta\'s had photos of naked teens in their master bedroom - all part of an art collection.  The collection also included &quot;long pig art&quot; (go google that if you dare) with humans dressed as pigs.</p>
<p>The MSM is hoping they can use top down tactics of the PRAVDA media days of old.   Media stories, likely coordinated through David Brock the ex-lover of James Alefantis, adopted the strategy of \'key word media\' using phrases like false, fake, utterly untrue, etc. without addressing any of the bizarre behavior.</p>
<p>The Spirit Cooking story had over 1.1 video hits.  The number has since been purged to 339,000.   The memes created detailing it were shared widely.</p>
<p>The determination has been made by Brock &amp; company that they can\'t explain the Instagram sick photos and comments, bands like Heavy Breathing (see page 6 of their website) who play at the \'family restaurant\' (they now have resorted to calling Comet a &quot;bar&quot; in recent media), or the since-removed art which decorated the walls at Comet.  
</p>
<p>They can\'t address any of these, so instead they are trying to keep the \'Overton Wndow\' where even mentioning Satanism or child sexual abuse is immediately dismissed.</p>
<p>It\'s an interesting tactic for them to take.  They have a compliant media, but the public now trusts the media less than any time since the question has been polled.  
</p>
<p>I think the strongest way for us to shift the window (re-frame the narrative) is to use IMAGES.</p>
<p>The photos from Spirit Cooking, Podesta\'s art collection, the Instagram account / bands / walls are the easiest way for people to \'get it.\'   Memes are ideal for this.</p>

            Today's NYTimes piece included an image of the code words, but doesn't make mention of whether there was any source to back it up.  I think this is still the weakest link in the case;  we're weeks into it but no source has emerged for the "code talk" except 4Chan.
