<p>This &quot;suicide&quot; didn\'t sit well with many of you</p>
<p>we thought there was more to the story </p>
<p>cover up maybe?</p>
<p>Some of this stuff sounds hokey, but you ask me, These Satanic cults believe this stuff, not hokey to them </p>
<p>this is one of those articles I like to skim</p>
<p>this site gets into the heavy symbolic history of the cult, that\'s were skimming comes in </p>
<p>but it does give a lot of info and connections of the Hart Family </p>
<p>HIS EYE IS ON THE SPARROW, DEVONTE AND THE HART WITCHES, LIES, CIA OCCULT BUREAU &amp; JONESTOWN</p>
<p>In Search of Black Assassins</p>
<p>anyone with doubt, you cant deny the pictures, which a lot of this I didn\'t know </p>
<p>sure makes you go hmmmm</p>
<p>The Goonies</p>
<p>All of the Hart adopted children were initiated into the kid’s Goonie Secret Cult.</p>
<p>For their blood oath covenants of secrecy, they had been promised a pirates’ adventure, a hidden treasure of riches, fame and LIGHT at the end of long secret dark subterranean tunnels. They lied to the children. Their Masonic blood covenants weren’t play, a game or fantasy. They were for real. They wanted them enslaved to Lucifer. They wanted their SOULS. Devonte led the children in resistance. He wouldn’t give his up.</p>
<p>As far as I can find,  Jen and Sarah Hart had no prior history, background or connection to the State of Texas before entering their foster care system, and Texas officials ain’t talking very much at all. Also, the children’s parents and love ones haven’t or can’t come forward to be identified or talk.</p>
<p>The Hart Witches joined the congregation, outer circle, and or the inner circle of the Harmony Park, Clark’s Grove, Minnesota. </p>
<p>It appears that all the 6 six [Hart ?] children were forced to be humiliated, used and abused in all the the grove’s pagan and satanic rites and festivals, particularly, Earth Project and Shanghai La Fest. There were also Oaktobefest, October 5, and Bella Fiore, May 24.</p>
<p>The Hart Witches forced the children to Wiccan Circle Dance for hours until possessed with demons and spirits. Joni Mitchell got involved in the Bohemian thing in Paris and finally she behaved so badly according to the people of Paris, with the DEVIL’s witchcraft and all- that she was kicked out of Paris. They did it very politely by refusing to renew her passport.</p>
<p>The DARK SUV that the Mendocino County Sheriff’s Department said that Jennifer Hart was driving was also a big LIE! They knew the license plate numbers, and exact and precise color of the SUV.</p>
<p>Someone were able to determine the Patsy Stand- In for Jennifer Hart with the ILLUMINATI pyramid symbol bought 5 (five) bananas for 5 (five) people in the SUV pushed over the cliff.</p>
<p>It was also no incidence that Jennifer and Sarah landed in Woodland just outside of Portland, Oregon from Minnesota for cover.</p>
<p>Bruce answered. He thought Hannah was 7 or 8 because she was missing her two front teeth, he told reporters. Bruce was stunned to find out she was nearly a teenager. The DeKalbs told The Washington Post that Hannah Hart dashed inside the house and made her way upstairs after Bruce opened the door. She woke up Dana DeKalb, and the Hart Tribe soon came to look for the girl claiming that she was disturbed after her cat was killed. Hannah was crouching between the DeKalbs’ bed and a dresser.</p>
<p>Hannah &amp; Devonte were Determined to Fight for their Souls, Lives, and the Other Children</p>
<p>Abigail, Sierra &amp; Hannah All  Appear to Have Their Teeth Knocked Out</p>
<p>Portland is a major outpost for Pizzagate Pedophile Rings. One recent study has found that Portland is a hub of child sex trafficking. It is also a hub for satanic pedophile rings.</p>
<p>One of the most satanic themed (and most illogically-located) businesses in the world has got to be “Voodoo Donuts” in Portland.</p>
<p>The business, located right next to two deviant hellholes, one of them being Dante’s [Hell] Satanic Strip Club, as well as being right on top of the confirmed infamous Child Trafficking SHANGHAI TUNNELS.</p>
<p>THE HART WITCHES ESCAPE TO WITCH (MENDOCINO) COUNTY</p>
<p>From Woodland,Portland, Oregon to Fort Bragg, Mendocino County, CA, it was no coincidence either.</p>
<p>The CIA Occult Bureau and MK ULTRA also setup Fort Bragg and Mendocino County as an outpost and haven for witch covens</p>

            , It's been two days, so I'm going to have to pull this post now, since you were not able to add links to evidence the women are "witches" who put the kids in a cult and decided to leave this claim presented as an established fact. The link provided did not present evidence of this, either; merely speculation. I am removing this per Rule 2. It's a great post for

            My boss showed me the article of the event, and instantly i said out loud it must be satanice related. I said this not knowing of their history, I merely saw a picture. I investigate pizzagate often however and as soon as this was in the news I immediately wondered if the date it happene had any significance? My boss was acting as though something like this is terrible and how could it happen, and my response was that its happening a lot more often this year...or you see a lot of effort to focus news on anything but this topic.

            thank you for explaining

             On of the BIGGEST reasons I stopped posting so much is this CONTINUAL WAVE of NEW LEARNERS THAT DON"T REALIZE THIS SATANIC WEB IS ABSOLUTELY EVERYWHERE AND WEAVED INTO THE VERY FABRIC OF YOUR VERY EXISTENCE.
            </p>
            <p>
             Although so many are "Woke" they still do not see how entirely enveloped in the system we are and it's going to take a hell of alot more awareness and a whole lot less of everyone being shocked and in disbelief of articles like Prince Rays MCBA... ALL OF THIS SHIT IS VERY, VERY REAL.

             Drinking the Kool-Aid: A Survivor Remembers Jim Jones
            </p>
            <p>
             As O'Shea tells it, Jones's idealism was a large part of what made him so lethal. He tapped into the zeitgeist of the late 1960s and 1970s, feeding on people's fears and promising to create a "rainbow family" where everyone would truly be equal. He was charismatic enough to lure hundreds of people to a South American jungle, where he cut off all their ties with the outside world

              Wow, Jim Jones promised to create a "rainbow family"?  That's very interesting.

              Jen Hart may not have known Fantuzzi well, nor other Rainbow Family members, but they are very suspicious.

            Lots of intriguing stuff here, New4now, but you need to have linked sources for each claim. I'm giving this the 24 Hour edit flair so you can add sources. Please reply to this comment when you've done so, and I will remove the flair.

             so by condensing what was in the article, I have to have other sources to these claims?

            <p>

              There are a number of problems here, n4n. One is that it is not clear which parts of your submission are quotes or paraphrases from the linked source, and which are not, since you didn't offset them with quote formatting (button 4).
             </p>
             <p>
              The other problem is the link you've provided is not an article, it's a speculative blog that gives no verifiable sources that I could find for its claims that the Hart moms are "witches" who initiated the kids into a cult. Now, it's an exceedingly long and rambling piece, so I may have missed the source of those claims. That would be the part you should pull out and direct quote in your submission for this to be a research post rather than a speculative one (which would belong in
              <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/v/pizzagatewhatever">
               v/pizzagatewhatever

               </blockquote>
               <p>
                so that it will be clear what is a direct quote, and what are your thoughts.

              I think many states are missing a lot of kids.  Some more than others, but I believe the count is much higher than believed.

                Bad news is always worse, I think, for they surely don't want people to know the real number.  If people new, I think they would be out in the streets.  Hmm.  I don't think they would be dancing.

                  I would think that since it is posted under discuss now, that it should be up to the reader to decide or research themselves.  I have always been of the mind that we all have different views and that it is open, so yeah, I don't understand the warning either.  I guess we have to wait for MSM to announce it Vital Evidence.  It's good to know that that there are many that were questioning the evidence posted by LE.

                      Yes, and I believe most people believe that there are way to many unanswered questions and too many things that make you scratch your head about this case.  One of the main things being LE trying to pass off the wrong woman.  Also the story changed too many times at the beginning.  If we were to do that it would be called CT.  Well, the point is that there should be much more discussion on this.  That is usually how we find more answers. We may not uncover all the answers, but we have some pretty smart people on here.

               Sorry.  Just saw your comment, did not get it in my messages.  Hmm.  That sure is an interesting theory.  Yes, I remember cummings and his coffins.  He used to have a biz on etsy.com but I have not checked if still there.  Saw that months ago. Possibly with the donut place too.  Those donuts are really suspect and the pizza place  This stuff is really sick.  WOW  Am I glad I stopped to type that in, and look at this!  His wife should be looked at too.

              I agree it needs more research if it was in that article.  I can't even remember who told me that, but I do put much stock in those that were abused.  I also know there are two Fort Braggs which someone told me in a former post. So possibly that is where the confusion lies.

                When stuff like this is read it could possibly pose suspicions:     Following World War II, the 82nd Airborne Division was permanently stationed at Fort Bragg, the only large unit there for some time. In July 1951, the XVIII Airborne Corps was reactivated at Fort Bragg. Fort Bragg became a center for unconventional warfare, with the creation of the Psychological Warfare Center in April 1952, followed by the 10th Special Forces Group.[10]       Psychological Warfare Center.   Also, though,  many are highly suspicious of things we have read about reports of what has happened on some AF Bases.  At least that is what I have read on voat  before.   So possibly that is where some of this stems from.

                 82 airborne are at ft Bragg in NC, home of JSOC and allegedly where Osama bin laden was trained.  I guess there is a ft bragg in CA but I know nothing about it.

                  I think that is where the confusion comes in, because there are two of them.  I guess the one in Cali has not been operating since 1916.

                    Wow.  Yes.  Does it not boggle the mind about what has happened in this country since JFK?  It hurts my head to run through it all.  I don't pretend to know all of it, but of what I do know, it is unbelievable.  Can you imagine trying to explain what we, being red pilled, to Newcomers?  Yes, people have to find out incrementally.  It could for real, blow someone's mind.

                 That's what I am saying.  The Special Warfare school for training Green Berets is at Bragg.  I've been there.  It's not a black site.  Delta trains there and their compound is there.  Again, good guys.

                  Presidio and Aquino.  Aquino is known to retaliate when he is written about.  He is a dangerous man.  And is good at retaliating.

              I  did not bring it up this time.  It was in the article posted within the post.  I was told by another member that they have researched it for years due to past abuse.  That is my reason.   I know there are some that do not agree.
