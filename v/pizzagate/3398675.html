<pre><code>ABC and Vanity Fair interviewed girls who said they were sexually abused by Jeffrey Epstein but never published the interviews.

Maria and Annie Farmer said that Epstein’s longtime associate, Ghislaine Maxwell, met them and convinced them to meet Epstein.

They said Maria was sexually assaulted by both Epstein and Maxwell and that Annie, 15 at the time, was sexually assaulted by Epstein at his ranch in New Mexico.

The girls were interviewed by Vanity Fair but the story the outlet published on Epstein included no mention of the girls.

Before it was published, Epstein himself had shown up at the Vanity Fair offices and spoke to then-editor-in-chief Graydon Carter, reported NPR.
