<p>SAN FRANCISCO, Nov. 15— The Army announced it is closing and demolishing a child-care center at its base at the Presidio after allegations that as many as 60 youngsters were sexually abused there.</p>
<p>Maj. Greg Rixon, an Army spokesman at the Pentagon, said the Presidio Child Development Center would be closed Friday and a new center would be opened by April.</p>
<p>A Presidio spokesman, Bob Mahoney, said the closing, which was disclosed Saturday, was for \'\'health, safety and sanitation reasons, and not as a result of allegations of child abuse.\'\'</p>

            The presidio pedo scandal can be directly tied into the franklin scandal through Col. Michael Aquino. Victims from the franklin case relayed how high Aquino was in the operation and he was also alleged to have abused the kids at presido as he was stationed there. He's one weird, sick freak
