            The weeks before the presidential election seem like a lifetime ago to me now. When I got to the polling place I just sat in my car and cried. I didn't truly wake up though until I saw the picture of the little girl whose arms were taped to the table with the adult man standing directly behind her. That was when I sat bolt upright and realized, "It's all true." This was shortly before the migration to Voat. Haven't looked back since. November of 2016? I'm not even the same person anymore.

            It all began when faced with immortality. Personal in ways beyond explanation. Having attained knowledge &amp; success &amp; power it did not shield from immortality. Loss drops you to you knees and crushes your soul. Being a trapped Silent Witness is the essence of cruelty. Asking for answers led to REvealtions in the pages of Revelations? Forgiveness asked as acceptance of the true sacrifice was revealed.
           </p>
           <p>
            Spent 7 years later trying to understand the mind through the greatest of "teachers" and certified as a scholar an expert on Truama and how to help even as my own PTSD screamed for Justice. Learned Freud &amp; Jung and everyone theory model known nothing satisfied.
           </p>
           <p>
            Then met a figure straight out of history by chance or divine appointment. World famous artist who was a child German child of Hitler's inner circle. Now at 80 yrs. in the US she trusted me to share the truth about Nazi Germany about the SS which she joined as a youth of Hitler at age 8 willingly with complete dedication. Her father high ranking SS that owned all the theaters in Berlin and Germany where the children and soldiers of the SS were indoctrinated. She explained the prominence of the Vatican in enforcing Hitler's plans. Watched Jewish children and families taken to camps.
           </p>
           <p>
            As the American soldiers broke through to Berlin she was overwhelmed with their moral protection. She met the first African American solider who scooped her and siblings up to be protected as her father was captured. They protected her and tried to help her escape the cinema where the US soldiers took over and began to unindoctrinate the Germans. She found out her whole family lied the whole country lied.
           </p>
           <p>
            She was taken captive in a psychiatric hospital as young girl witnessed horrific experiments. A nurse helped her flee into Sweden through labor camps for years to service.
           </p>
           <p>
            She began to paint about her horror and trauma. Became famous left on one of first ships to Ellis Island. Became acclaimed artist. Paintings in museums and locations around the world. She spent ten years in jungian analysis.
           </p>
           <p>
            Met her out miracle in 2009 she shared her story at age 80 that had never been told to anyone. She allowed me the blessing of holding a safe place for releasing all the evil she had endured. She cried in my arms for three days straight as she was dying. I told her God was not who had been depicted to her. He loved her and forgave her as she asked. She revealed a final painting to me of the cross. The sacrifice for all. She died in my arms in 2010. Never shared her story as I wanted fully understand and am only now in past year and month especially has her story allowed me to connect the CIA with help from the Vatican to fully understand. Research Zionism and Ashkenazi Jews and geneology. This is the real story. It connects Tavistock to Escalen a place personally visited. Trust that the story is deeper than one can imagine. Hope to share her story someday to help others connect some dots. Aware of manuscript never been published and is protected. Read it. 
Not saying this lightly never told her story before do not know how it will play out. History is different than we thought in so many ways.

             Very interesting story.  The trauma that children had to endure during that time is heartbreaking. I would appreciate you sharing her story sometime when the time is right for you to share.

              Yes I would like to share when appropriate believe it or not it would shock most historians. They have always heard stories about the 
Jewish holocaust victims and survivors. It is horrifying beyond belief but when you meet a human being who as a child had access to the inner occult of the SS and was of German bloodline pure and simple. Hearing it from the perspective of her at age 80 with brilliance and full faulty and her attempts to warn the political elite a in America were saying and being worshipped in 2009.  &amp; 2010 and looking me dead in the eye to explain the rise of Hitler to the current political climate of that time. Worship of a political figure sawing the youth with promise of free things and inclusion. Looked at me dead in the eye to say this is exactly what happened to the German youth and then came PC. Censored speech and so on. She died asking me to promise I would tell the truth when it came time about the deception. To tell history. She was in direct Jungian Analysis for ten years. This connects to Tav. And Escalen now. The inner workings of Dr. Mengele and Operation Paperclip. The Vatican in charge. So much deception and I was humbled and blessed as to why she would trust me with this hidden pain and truth. I held her for 72 hours sraight in my arms as she was bedridden and allowed her to cry unconsolobly as if that 8 year old had never been safe to tell the truth and never been accepted and shown she was worthy of Gods love. It was my honor. She died on my birthday after suffering a massive brain stem stroke. Her last words after a call to 911 to try and rescue her was in an emergency room where doctors had just informed and showed pictures of brain stem stroke. She was "shut in" and was told could no longer communicate or have any movement and would die soon. I knelt by her bed placed my hands in hers and told her God loves her and so do I. She awoke suddenly gained her facilities grasped my hand and said "J*
              <strong>
               <em>
                na the German way to say my first name. She said J
               </em>
              </strong>
              na it is your birthday! Looked at me in the eyes pulled me to her face and belted out the "Happy Birthday" sons to me in the ICU we and then smiled gave me a secret message to call her only child, a 60 year old professor who had not had contact with her in over 10 years.
             </p>
             <p>
              The neurologist, nurses, medical staff stepped back in aghast at this moment stating it was impossible only 5 minutes before proved on MRI pictures of full brain stem stroke and bleed, paralysis of her body. These were the last words or movement she ever made.
             </p>
             <p>
              I am not sensationalize. I would never to that and can only attest to what  mI and others witnessed. I was the only one who she had ever told her truth too. Spent two to three days aweek for upto four hours at a time just listening and practicing acceptance and grace.
             </p>
             <p>
              I am nothing special in this story and there are many factors that give me additional insight but I know God granted me (who is nothing special except a deep understanding of trauma on the soul. And trapped Silent victims as well as witnesses.
             </p>
             <p>
              I kept the story in my heart not knowing what it all meant but knowing there might be a time I can help connect some dots to see deep into the truth and help others see it as God would allow.
             </p>
             <p>
              I only share now to say there are untold stories and misinformation about most of this. There of course is more to release that might help shed light on how Freud, Hitler, Stalin etc were in Vienna just prior to WW11.
             </p>
             <p>
              Just hope others will be open to the possibility that history is deeper than we think. Many have twisted the story of WW11. They do not understand how it relates to scripture. I am of course a representative some of this. Just asked to not be shutdown by questioning my faith or motivations. Truth is what we all seek right. Not a apologist or hater of anyone. Simply will not cast stones or make accusations that are knowingly false. Welcome all questions all commentaries, all different perspectives. Let's get it out in the open and the miracle of truth will set people free.
             </p>
             <p>
              These perversions of evil need exposure and truth to help foster openess to previously taboo topics. It is time

            I, too poured over each wikileaks drop that month of October.  It was so exciting going through them hoping to find the "smoking gun". I did this while at work, in the car while my son practiced football..All while texting with a friend as she did the same. Simultaneously seeing what was being found through twitter.  I remember us texting about the pizza and the handkerchief...wtf?  I was just about to go to bed one night and I saw a twitter post and video from Brittany Pettibone or Reality Calls...with the spirit cooking email. Didn't get much sleep that night or many nights after that.
           </p>
           <p>
            The enormity of it is overwhelming. The fact that so many people get off on causing pain, torturing children. And it makes me feel bitter when I can get 40 likes on fb when I post a pic of my cat, but I can post about rampant pedophilia and it's crickets.

            It started for me when Bill Clinton was elected. And then when Janet Reno burned up those Branch Dividian children.
           </p>
           <p>
            Then all those day care abusers got a free ride because the kids talked about ritual abuse.

           <p>
            Then the Catholic church started basically coming right out and raping boys in public.

            Read Rev. 17 &amp; 18. The end for these creeps is coming and the side you want to be on is the side of the Lord's.

            Just read the KJV though, all those other versions are watered down.

             Isaiah 9:10 and the connection to 9/11.
            </p>
            <p>
             And 9/11 was what made me look at our leaders differently. I was a political liberal on a left-wing forum when someone posted about Salman Rushdie being barred from flying for some mysterious reason around the time of 9/11. I remember they linked to a Toronto newspaper article about him being banned for security reasons. The article was dated 9/11/01 and I read it all, waiting for the attacks to be mentioned, and surprised when I finished it but they weren't. At that point, the first week after the attacks, just about everything you read and heard was about 9/11. Then it hit me that the article had been written before the attacks and was published in print on 9/11 itself.  I don't remember coming across any conspiracy theory talk about 9/11 before Salman Rushdie was raised, but it was continuous after that, of people questioning this and that. Pizzagate reminds me of it, that there are endless revelations that are so troubling and hard to believe, but apparently true.

            Yup. My own awakening was the Wikileaks AMA on Reddit, I think either the day of, or the day after, the election. Reading through, someone asked "What do you think about the CPP situation?" I still remember that Wikileaks responded simple with:
           </p>
           <p>
            "We don't know what to make of it. It is interesting."
           </p>
           <p>
            My first thought was "CPP? What the hell is that?" So, I went and looked it up, and found the pizzagate subreddit. From there...yeah...life's been a lot different for the last few months.

            I found out on Oct 29th from Anon through a series of links. I haven't slept a good night since. I just keep digging. The worst, is nobody I know believes this. They don't want to acknowledge it at all.

            There has been undeniable proof of high level DC participation in these blood/sex cults since at least the 1980s with the revelations in The Franklin Coverup.  Earliest credible reports on these cults are from around 3k years ago with the God of Israel promising to scatter them to the 4 winds for sacrificing their children to Molech.  From those days until now people who tell the plain obvious truth are ridiculed and all proof ignored.  Maybe this will be what changes all that.  I hope so.

            I spent October poring through the WikiLeaks emails and sending to various news outlets, much to the detriment of my bank account. When I ran across the pizza related hanky email and the dominoes on cheese email I was like... Well that was weird. Had not seen the pedo connection at the time. When WikiLeaks sent out the spirit cooking tweet, it all blew up.

            I got on Reddit about a month before election.  Followed the Donald and that let to pizzagate then here. My dad had a run in with the illuminati elites back in the 80's so I knew they were screwed up just didn't know how horrible they really are.  It's hard to discount so many victims who tell the same story over and over.

            i remember seeing part of a video by the MKUltra victim Cathy O'Brien.  I was so sickened.  Normally I pass things off as crazy but it just stuck with me.  Then very shortly, days after that, Podesta pizza e-mails on Wikileaks.  It just can't be denied.  So I look at the deniers and wonder what is up with them.  Red flags

             I had seen Cathy years ago.....didnt believe a word...it was so fucking nuts....involved both Parties and years and years of sex torture....involving her dad getting caught for incest and the Government liking it and giving him money to take his daughter?   Oh how naive I was.  I couldnt believe it....
            </p>
            <p>
             Much like I coulnt believe 9/11 was an inside job I couldnt imagine the Government being involved in killing 3000 of their own citizens.  But put in the fact the Leaders of the world are a Cult of Satanic assholes and the whole 9/11 was just a giant spell cast on the world and that they LIKE the death and destruction.
            </p>
            <p>
             And the documentary ¨Making a Murder¨ I understood they framed the dude the first time...but the murder of the poor lady just to frame him again and to take the pressure off the local government?   NO WAY...the cops would kill an innocent woman just to set up a guy......LOL what a dumbass I was....for sure they would.....the whole damn town is likely run by a Satanic Coven that was very pissed his Lawyers were getting very close to putting some of them in jail or costing them millions and millions.   They dont care about the innocent woman......she is just a GOYIM....a tool that they needed.....of course they would kill an innocent if that was what it took....

            I signed up at Reddit about 3-4 days before the voat migration.  I almost didn't follow, but I was intrigued. And I'm still here, sputtering out pieces of information here and there.  I remember someone posting a video of the band playing from the titanic movie right before the ship went down.

            There are many days when I wish I could go back to the land of not knowing.  Every time I see a pedo swirl, I wish I had an iv with anti-nausea meds. It sickens me to the core. But my just rewards are waiting on me.  Let me save a child while I'm holding on to this earth. It's the least I can do.

            Finding out about pizzagate on 4chan and reddit the week before the term 'fake news' even came out redpilled me, and when those pages got scrubbed and shilled I was completely convinced.

            I don't know which is worse, the child abuse or organ harvesting, the extent of both of these revealed in these past few months is mind boggling, and I had seen Sibel Edmond's videos years ago, I know victims of the catholic church abuse and I was really pissed when the DNC fucked with bernie. It feels like there isn't anything left that isn't some kind of con, scam or outright abuse.

            It started for me years back when I used to read about the Bush family and the child hunting games.  I could only rely on written literature from the library and such as there was no Internet back then.  I was always suspiscious of the workings of the Government, etc, but never would have imagined this level of fucked-upness.  They say life begins at 40, in my case I feel like I have entered the f*cking twilight zone.

            I take comfort that the masses are waking up, power in numbers ...light will always prevail ... eventually.

            That was pretty much it for me too - ZH has taught me a lot over the years. Ive been on it for over 7 years, about 9 months after it first started

            Here's a little history.  When all of this was breaking I went onto YT and searched "pizzagate". That day only 1 vid popped up.  I squeezed my eyes really tightly closed and then begged the universe to please please please get things going on YT. If they had shut it down then we would never be where we are today.
           </p>
           <p>
            I went through that little ritual every day.  It took two days to get to 3. Another 2 days to get to 5. The next day 8, then 20  then....well, within a week there were maybe 2500, by the following week about 10,000 and it rose from there.  Maybe around 100k,  people started getting takedowns but it was .....too....late.
           </p>
           <p>
            About 150k they started really dicking with the numbers so it got harder to tell what was going on but my sense wad that it was exponential and I think it just keeps spreading wider and wider.
           </p>
           <p>
            Those early Seaman vids, for example, are still being shared on other channels.  They don't  direct back to David, they must show up on other channels.   Same with lots of other well known vids. Do the same thing.  Those views aren't even counted.

             "About 150k...".......I love that Math zzvoat. Exponential growth is a wonderful thing when it gets going. And it's barely gotten started. I'm freaking out this could turn into "The Reign Of Terror". I don't own a gun and never will. I don't believe in violence ever. But I'm just one person. If people find out the Bush's, Clinton's and Cheney and whoever the fuck else were making child pornography snuff films I don't know what your average red neck will do. The fucking psychopaths behind this dodged an 88mm anti-tank round with the Franklin Scandal. The internet won't allow them the same luck today, oops.
            </p>
            <p>
             There's going to be a point in the next 6 months when this fucker hits a critical mass and it'll either melt the internet or reverse the magnetic poles .......or both.

              If said magnetic poles reverse, you may wish you owned a gun...especially if you live in a big city.

              But, hey, to each his own.  I like my odds in bumblefuck nowhereville much better.

             <p>
              And before you jump to the assumption (seems like you already have) that all gun owners are uneducated rednecks...I lived in NYC and SF for 15 years, have friends of all stripes and colors, am college educated, and was making mid-six figures for a long time before realizing there was no fucking way I as raising my kids in one of the urban cesspools in our country...

               But for the kids, my life mirrors yours very closely. And yet, despite having moved to the middle of somewhere as I like to call it, here we are-- on Voat and part of the group who would like nothing more than to see the pedos with cuffs on and charges that stick. A pole shift, Satanists, pedophiles, Planet X, reptillians-- spirit cookers-- I feel like I jumped the turnstile and took the wrong train.

               I honestly don't think it would get that bad. However on the topic of dishing out Old Testament justice for child rapists I've gotta go with the Krupp 88mm AntiTank gun. Or AntiAircraft gun, either or. Come to think of it AntiAircraft gun with a proximity fuze set to detonate 1 foot from its target. There'd be nothing left but a pink mist.

                The next financial collapse is going to be the mother of them all. Central banks have blown the biggest bubble in modern history. It won't and well.

               <p>
                Just how bad it gets is open for debate, by it IS coming. The longer they delay it with more money printing, the worse the fallout will be.

                 I think you're awfulizing. Nothing could top the financial collapse of 2008, that was 1 in 100 years. Plus the markets are doing really well lately:

                  I'll save these debates for Naked Capitalism, Seeking Alpha, and Zerohedge. But if you believe the financial crisis is over, then you've bought into some of the same corporate media lies that are also covering for pedogate. We never recovered...financial fuckery....the big one is coming...

                    Deflation of all risk assets (stocks, real estate, certain commodities), then hyperinflation after the central banks go all in with their final explosion of money-printing. After the next inevitsbke correction, QE4 is coming...they may call it something else, but more of the same...and this one will be the mother of all QE. Guess we will see.

                   <p>
                    On another note, I find it somewhat interesting/refreshing that this whole pizzagate thing has brought together people from so many walks of life and different ideologies to combat a single problem...the exploitation of children.

                 Good point bopper. The Old Testament justice I'm thinking of is the fire and brimstone variety, real old school wrath of God type shit. You can get hit by a few rocks in the head and die in one piece. Or you can get hit with a 45 lbs chunk of brimstone or the equivalent an 88mm anti-aircraft round with a proximity fuze.

              You're not alone.  Despite decades of so-called conspiracy theorists suggesting it for years, it's like suddenly finding yourself on a new world.  If you'd told me ten years ago David Icke would largely be vindicated, I'd have laughed and said you were crazy.  Amazing how things can change.

               Yup. That awkward moment when you realize the so-called right-wing conspiracy nuts aren't actually so crazy. I'd heard about this stuff for SO many years, but it was this evil pedogate stuff that woke me up and brought me to my knees. I can never go back and will never see anything about the world the same way again. It's hard to be awake but weirdly freeing at the same time.

              Then definitely don't watch Kay Griggs. It made my blood boil listening to her explain things we only started learning about recently when she did her interview in '96. Ugh. So infuriating and scary.

              For me it was kind of the opposite. Such a big relief to see a chance to take this scum go down, after watching them for over 15 years. Would be very long list to name all the police men, journalists, investigators and witnesses they killed over the years.

              I think I had a bit of a breakdown when I first accepted the possibility this was all true. Came down with a month long cold &amp; severe depression. Then I got pissed &amp; decided I could not allow this to continue. I will do everything I can to save victims &amp; bring justice to perps.

               In early December I was freaking out....told my teenage daughter to watch me I was worried I was going nuts.....but that only lasted about two days.....WE both are convinced it is all true....and that we live in a world way more evil and dark than we ever imagined before.   My friend told me that we are actually in HELL already on Earth....it kind of feels that way.

            It began for me when I found out that Bill hung out with Epstein. Then all the conspiracies I always thought where interesting all lined up and clicked together.

             I was 20 when WJC was elected and I cried!!! My spirit knew something was very wrong even though I didn't know much about him. I was deceived by bush and now I am an independent who no longer believes that my government has the best interest of the American People at heart.

             Pedogate, was, for me, a process. I had known of serial killers like Albert Gray and John Wayne Gacy. I had, over my process of political conversion starting around August 2014, learned of the crimes of the Clintons. During the previous election, I had before learned no greater magnitude of depravity and turpitude than I did learn at that time. I was convinced of the Clinton Body Count's veracity; mainstream media gave up their fake air of impartiality. Each leak convinced me of the greater degeneration of the political apparatus.
            </p>
            <p>
             It's only because of hindsight bias, but I can now see adumbrations of Pedogate.

              Isnt if kind of funny that the LEFT Is now scared of Russia?   When they have a long history in the FAKE cold war of being close to the Marxist?Leninist and spying for the USSR against America?   It kind of makes me laugh......like the scene in the book 1984 when the Government announces they are at war with their past allies and allied with their past enemies...and then their media declares it has always been this way....the people are just confused.....dont believe their memories....believe the fucking TV NOW&gt;...LOL....

              I think this is what is WAKING people up finally.....the obvious fact that the MEDIA is all controlled.  It is truly the MINISTRY OF TRUTH.....

              What is really scary is that the Book and Movie 1984 and the Movie V for Vendetta.......are movies that tell you that this is what may happen in the FUTURE&gt;....But the real understanding of both movies....is this is actually what is happening right NOW.   Not in the future.....NOW in fact.   When you realize that.....it will freak you out...they are telling you about our world right NOW&gt;

               It's bizarre. And while they're talking Russia back up into the Soviet Empire, something that only people who actually didn't live through the Cold War or didn't pay attention to it might believe, they ignore and even buddy up to the country that really is the obvious threat, and is making no secret about it, China. It's practically come out and said it won't give up its communist dictatorship and wants to replace the U.S. as the world's most powerful nation, and the media reports daily on the steps it's taking to do so. Yet the left wants us to prepare for a Russian invasion and perhaps a Russian nuclear attack.
