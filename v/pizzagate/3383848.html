<p>&quot;Ronald (\'62) is a socially responsible entrepreneur. His background is economy, psychology, architecture and theology. For 30 years he worked independently in a variety of branches. In the financial sector it was asset management, currency- and deposit trade. He is well known in several EU countries. His mission is \'A Good Steward- ship of All Life.\' For him it\'s foremost about the children worldwide. The children are our future. More info can be found here!&quot;</p>
<p>I combined the interviews he had when he admits he was invited to sacrifice children.</p>
