He used to be loved by the French MSM, as he was a symbol of anti-racism (he\'s black). Then one day of December 2003, during a gig on live TV, he <a href="http://www.dailymotion.com/video/x9ghlo_dieudonne-chez-fogiel-sketch-scanda_webcam">dared dress up</a> as an Iraeli settler and make fun of the &quot;axis of good&quot;, the &quot;Americano-Zionist axis&quot; (the Irak war was raging). Everyone on the set &amp; in the audience laughed when he did it. But the backlash was immense. </p>
<p>Long story short, he was called an antisemite, said it wasn\'t so and refused to apologize, and was thereafter ostracized. So he doubled-down on Zionism, and has been public enemy No. 1 ever since (the French PM Manuel Valls gave entire speeches on how he\'ll bring him down). Dieudonné regularly utters heretical pronunciations such as &quot;I\'m agnostic on the Holocaust&quot; or &quot;I\'m not currently an antisemite, I don\'t really have time for it, but I\'m not ruling it out for the future&quot;. He is regularly slandered, banned, harassed, prosecuted and detained. Without any mainstream exposure, he however fills up huge theaters (he gathers the largest audiences by far among French stand-up comedians). His videos on Youtube (200k subscribers) gather massive audiences; 400k+ views on a regular basis; to understand how big this is remember there are less than 200 million French speakers in the world, and <a href="https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Francophonie#/media/File:New-Map-Francophone_World.PNG">most of them are</a> in Africa.</p>
<hr />
<p>A few years ago Dieudonné hosted the (grown-up) children of high magistrate Pierre Roche, who recalled in every sordid detail the deathbed testimony of their dad, Pierre Roche, a famous French high-magistrate whose name was cited in the <a href="https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patrice_Al%C3%A8gre">Allègre criminal case.</a>.</p>
<p>They describe child abuse, torture and ritual sacrifice. Everything that was ever alleged in Pizzagate is confirmed here by two credible witnesses as happening in France. Needless to say no investigation followed the release of that testimony, nor was there any media coverage of it. Add to that the <a href="https://www.amazon.fr/Dutroux-pervers-isol%C3%A9-Xavier-Magn%C3%A9e/dp/2702135633">book</a> written by Dutroux\' lawyer, describing the same kind of widespread institutional practice, and you have corroborated evidence of a pedocriminal French State.</p>
<hr />
<p>Here is the video of Charles-Louis &amp; Diane Roche\'s testimony (French): <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7_NtyXNwxE">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7_NtyXNwxE</a></p>
<p>I found a version that says has English subtitles (can\'t seem to see them, posting anyway) : <a href="https://vimeo.com/119549906">https://vimeo.com/119549906</a></p>
<p>Here is the text introduction I translated:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>On February 21 2002, Patrice Allègre was sentenced to life in jail for the murder of several young girls, savagely assassinated in the region of Toulouse. </p>
<p>His trial, widely covered by the media, revealed through multiple witness accounts an entreprise much larger; that of a veritable criminal organization involving influential political &amp; judicial personalities, such as Dominique Baudis or the high magistrate Pierre Roche.</p>
<p>Notably, the testimony of two prostitutes, close to the main defendant, told of sado-masochistic parties during which horrible crimes were played out in a sordid and cruel way, by a group comprising people with positions of high responsibility.</p>
<p>Since the sentencing of Allègre, the issue has stalled, and the two prostitutes even recanted their testimonies, thus erasing in the eyes of the justice system the story of a criminal organization within the highest spheres of power.</p>
<p>However the sudden and unexplained death of the magistrate Pierre Roche contributed in reigniting the issue of a vast criminal network and its unsavory practices.</p>
<p>Shortly before his death, confirmed by the idea he knew too much, Pierre Roch told his two children, Diane and Charles-Louis, about his experience participating in these surreal parties.</p>
<p>Here is the testimony as given by his two children in September 2005.</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<p>French Pizzagate in alive and well, but no similar crowd-sourced investigation is happening here. Yet we have the same overt manifestations as you do. Here pedocriminal &quot;art&quot; exhibitions are <a href="http://www.sudouest.fr/2015/09/08/la-mouette-denonce-un-catalogue-d-oeuvres-pedophiles-2117625-2780.php">organized and subsidized.</a>. If you want a small glimpse of it look into American artist <a href="http://www.stumead.com/">Stu Mead</a>, he is a sick freak and exposes his subsidized &quot;art&quot; everywhere in Europe.</p>
<p>Last time I looked I hadn\'t found any connection to your main defendants, so I refrained from posting anything. But that was last year, and since then you guys identified many other persons of interest. Perhaps you can now connect Stu Mead to your main defendants, IDK. In any case I recommend you watch the Roche testimony, it might provide clues and insight.</p>',

            The vimeo video of the Charles and Diane Roche interview that OP embedded does have English subtitles, you just have to enable them by clicking on the "CC" close caption button at the bottom right of the vid and then selecting English. 
Also, great vid OP, the brother and sister both seem very intelligent and perceptive, and all the more credible for it. For example, they stick to just stating the facts about the parties/rituals that were related to them by their father and avoid using the satanic(and other) labels, even when prodded by the interviewer to do so. They also seem truly disturbed by what they were told/found out, and this is reflected in how they will try to generalize and not go into gory, specific details, which goes a long way towards this not seeming like a sensationalized story they're putting out there for their own gain. Lessons to be learned from how they handle themselves in this

            Charles &amp; Diane are describing Pizzagate/Pedogate. Their testimony is from 2005. Like the Dutroux affair, the main suspect served as a scapegoat. The justice covered the case in order to hide the whole network.
           </p>
           <p>
            If you listen to their testimony, everything is perfectly clear, described, and echoes many other testimonies from abused children. The internationalization of this network is a reality. But at this stage, the purpose of this madness was pretty obscure, unexplained, with no ties in the world geopolitical context.
           </p>
           <p>
            However, although the sectarian aspect seems to predominate, these practices are neither more nor less than cases of blackmail. By unbridling the participants, they make them commit the worst abominations. So, "you are different, you are the chosen one, you must do this or that..." And we will videotape you. Just in case.
           </p>
           <p>
            Upvote the thread, the entrapment method and the horror show described in their testimony deserve to be heard. It is one of the major affair involving the french elite.

            Thanks so much for pointing out the "global" problem to us.  Here in America, we think the sun rises and sets on our problems.  Not this time.  Keep reminding us!  It's important.  FYI, everyone I know in America that studies Pizzagate is hoping Marine Le Pen takes power.  It's possible she will work with Trump where many others will not.
