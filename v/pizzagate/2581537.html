<p>First, there are 3 reporters credited on this article. That\'s a bit odd. Usually there\'s just one, and sometimes two, but I\'ve never seen three unless it\'s some undercover investigative piece, and even 3 is a stretch for those types of articles. </p>
<p>Second, the article states that he was there to delivery PASTA to the Sergeant who is later described in the article as &quot;spaghetti-loving&quot;. </p>
<p>Third, the pizza delivery guy is married to an American woman with two daughters. Although, nowhere in the article does it say that the delivery guy fathered these girls. It\'s only implied. The wife is quoted as saying, “It’s cruel that they’re going to separate <strong>my daughters</strong> from him. He’s supporting the family and now I’m going to be by myself with them.&quot; </p>
<p>Under the photo, it states, &quot;wife of Pablo, with <strong>her</strong> children&quot;</p>
<p>Remember that &quot;pasta&quot; is code for &quot;little girl&quot;.</p>
<p>Another thing I noticed strange is that the wife\'s last name just happens to be \'Chico\', which means &quot;boy&quot; in Spanish. BUT, her name is spelled \'Chico\' in the description under the photo of them, but in the article below this, it states her last name is Chica, which would be Spanish for &quot;little girl&quot;. </p>
<p>Aaannddd there\'s a clown in this story, too, who obviously knows the pizza delivery guy well. &quot;He\'s a really good guy,” said Cyrus Zavieh, 48, a professional clown whom Villavicencio booked to perform at his daughter’s birthday party next month. </p>
<p>He must be really good friends with this clown because the clown states that pizza dude has delivered to the base many times with no problem. </p>
<p>For the finale, the article ends with the Pentagon commenting and bickering between a Republican and a Democrat about liberals and keeping our streets safe now that a pizza delivery guy is off the streets. And all of this is happening at an Army base. </p>
<p>I mean, is this seriously a real news story? I\'m calling fake news here. Maybe it\'s been created as code for something, but just the facts alone that they needed three people to write this lame article, it\'s rife with symbolism, and to top it off they\'re actually interviewing a clown (jester) screams fake news. I mean, where did they find this guy? Of all the people these three journalists could think to interview and they pick the kid\'s birthday entertainment who just happens to know that the pizza guy goes to the base often? </p>
<p>I didn\'t quote much of the article as I usually do because I want people to actually read it for themselves to get the full scope. </p>
<p>As an aside, I\'m noticing a lot of 8s and 3s. </p>
<p>So, am I seeing stuff that\'s not there, or are you thinking what I\'m thinking? Could this be a fake news story, and/or was it written to send a message to those in the know? I\'m not sure at this point, and I\'m very interested in what you all think. I guess it could be a real thing happening. I mean, stranger things have happened, right? </p>
<p>Oh, yeah. I forgot to mention it\'s the NY Times.</p>

            I agree, it is an odd story, but we need to see a stronger connection to #pg (as defined in Rule 1) in order to allow this to stay up.

             Hi, Ben, and thanks for agreeing this is strange, but I think I've covered the bases for rule #1. I can edit my post if you'd like me to come right out and say that this news article is code for traffickers and pedos. Maybe the daughters are being pimped out. Maybe it's to put creepers at the Army bases on notice that they shouldn't be ordering in any CP. I don't know, but considering this is a developing story, if they do post any updates, this needs to stay here because of all of the symbols. After all, why would it even be important to mention how much to sergeant loves PASTA?
            </p>
            <p>
             Thanks for spotting a 4th journalist. I'm planning on looking into these so-called professionals later and post what I find. I just don't have time right now.

              We'd need some more hints here that the story is suspicious.

            Three journalists means they probably went to different locations.  One to the base, one to the pizzeria, which is misspelled as well, and one out to Queens.  They just get assigned different aspects of the story.

            You can get some of the best pizza in america at neighborhood joints right by that Army Base.

              One of them is a sit down joint with a coal oven.  Ever have coal-oven pizza?  They're fantastic.  The oven can get to 900 degrees, cooks the dough real fast, the tomato sauce doesn't need to be cooked beforehand.  A very different flavor from a gas oven.
             </p>
             <p>
              The other place is just a small neighborhood joint with some booths for seating, but they do a particular style there, like an old-fashioned Sicilian pizza you would make at home, that's the best I've had of that style.  Just looked up a review of it, and they call this place, a narrow little gem, their pizza is excellent with more tomato flavor than usual in the sauce, they say their version of the margarita is a masterpiece.

            Looking back at the article, the close up of the pizza guy includes part of the little girl's jean jacket and it has a watermelon on it. It's late and I can't recall for sure, but wasn't watermelon a pedo code? I remember it being in Katy Perry's creepy video
