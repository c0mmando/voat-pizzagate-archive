<p>Lord Janvrin became a Trustee in 2009 and as Chairman has guided the Royal Foundation from its inception to become the main charitable platform for The Duke, The Duchess and Prince Harry. During this time the Foundation has developed innovative projects in all of its core areas of focus – supporting children and young people, promoting the welfare of those who have served in the military and their families, and conservation projects. Leading examples of these include <strong>the Invictus Games</strong>, United for Wildlife, the Endeavour Fund and the sports apprenticeship programme Coach Core. </p>

<p>I have for some time believed that MI5 have been involved in the gagging of the media over the £1bn HSBC fraud. Current HSBC Director Jonathan Evans is ex-head of MI5 and was made a Lord at the time HSBC director Rona Fairhead was corruptly appointed Chair of the BBC Trust.</p>

<p>Let\'s not forget:</p>
<p><strong>FBI Director Comey was board member of HSBC</strong> – Clinton Foundation &amp; Drug Cartel ‘bank of choice’
 <a href="https://geopolitics.co/2017/03/21/fbi-dir-james-comey-board-member-of-hsbc-clinton-foundation-drug-cartel-launderer/">https://geopolitics.co/2017/03/21/fbi-dir-james-comey-board-member-of-hsbc-clinton-foundation-drug-cartel-launderer/</a></p>
<p>Clinton foundation received up to $81m from clients of controversial HSBC bank</p>
<p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/feb/10/hillary-clinton-foundation-donors-hsbc-swiss-bank">https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/feb/10/hillary-clinton-foundation-donors-hsbc-swiss-bank</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>They include <strong>Frank Giustra</strong>, a Canadian mining magnate and one of the foundation’s biggest financial backers, and Richard Caring, the British retail magnate who, the bank’s internal records show, used his tax-free Geneva account to transfer $1m into the New York-based foundation. </p>
<p>Another Clinton foundation donor who had a HSBC account in the tax haven is <strong>Jeffrey Epstein</strong>, the hedge fund manager and convicted sex offender who once flew the former president on his private jet for charity events in Africa. </p>
<p>Other HSBC Geneva clients who donated $1m or more to the Clinton foundation include ex-Formula One racing driver Michael Schumacher, billionaire businessman Eli Broad, and the French hedge-fund manager Arpad Busson.</p>

<p><strong>Arpad Busson</strong> <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/comment/personal-view/8570184/A-rich-man-but-a-pretty-poor-playboy.html">https://www.telegraph.co.uk/comment/personal-view/8570184/A-rich-man-but-a-pretty-poor-playboy.html</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>In the past week Busson – &quot;Arki&quot; to his friends – came in for a sustained drubbing in some sections of the media, which accused him of presiding over an evening of &quot;ostentatious vulgarity&quot; that is considered ill-timed in this era of economic austerity. The event? The 10th ARK (Absolute Return for Kids) charity gala auction, held last Thursday, during which the fabulously rich bid thousands for a range of luxury lots. And managed to raise eye-watering millions (£17.2 million) for an array of children\'s health and education projects in the UK and abroad. This year\'s guests of honour just happened to be the newly married Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, who announced a £5 million partnership between the Prince\'s Foundation and ARK, which will fund Outward Bound trips for British youngsters living in inner cities, as well as supporting projects in Africa.</p>

<p><a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1500330">Another piece of the big picture. ARK/Child and organ trafficking/Dutroux affair. Big connections.</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Kouchner was also the head of UNMIK (UN mission in Kosovo). Considering his role, there is absolutely NO WAY he was not aware what was going on with the KLA (Kosovo Liberation Army) - human/child/arms/organ trafficking. Multiple sources state that Kouchner was not only aware of what was going on with the KLA, but was also involved in it. Prime Minister of Kosovo- Hashim Thaci was actually found to be the HEAD of an organ/arms (weapons, not appendages- haha- have to make a joke every now and then to keep from losing it) ring. </p>
<p>Kouchner is also tied to A.R.K., through Bernard Sabrier\'s organization &quot;Children Action&quot;. <strong>A.R.K. is a major CF/CGI donor.</strong></p>
<p>A.R.K. is founded by Arpad Busson. Arpad Busson also founded E.I.M. There are multiple claims (some on WikiLeaks) that E.I.M. is tied to the Dutroux affair, through chairman Jean-Pierre Etter - implicated by multiple witnesses as being one of the child abusers/rapists.</p>
<p>&quot;Children Action&quot; is also tied to Arpad Busson, through his ex/mother of his children- <strong>Elle MacPherson, who held fundraisers for Children Action.</strong></p>
<p>Keep in mind, as well, that ARK funded &quot;Teens and Toddlers&quot;, which started &quot;Project Caressing&quot; - an effort for children to touch old men and vice versa- for therapeutic reasons.</p>

            HSBC has branches in Mexico. Big companies multinational companies that operate in Mexico, like Laureate Unversities use them. They want every scrap of info about you when you open an account. I was starting to get worried that the would ask me for a lock of hair or maybe try for a colonoscopy or something.

              Eric Gill (1882-1940) was born in Brighton, England, to a minister of a small Protestant sect. He eventually became an artist, well known for his sculptures, engravings, sketches, writings, and type fonts. He married in 1904 and joined the Fabian Socialist Society in 1905. As is noted in Distributist Perspectives, he is one of the founding members of the Distributist worker community at Ditchling, Sussex. It was there that he entered the Catholic Church in 1913. In his lifetime, he would found two more worker communities. He would receive many important and prestigious commissions, including works for Westminster Cathedral, the League of Nations,

              Contrary to popular opinion, it is not “demand” from the world’s population which creates the mind destroying drug trade. Rather, it is the world financial oligarchy, looking for massive profits and the destruction of the minds of the population it is determined to dominate, which organized the drug trade. The case of HSBC underscores that point. Serving as the central bank of this global apparatus, is HSBC.

             As the opium and other trade with China expanded, Britain’s new territory of Hong Kong became a major imperial commercial center. The opium dealers gathered together to form a bank, the Hongkong and Shanghai Bank, as the financial flagship of the British opium trade. Over time, the bank—now known as HSBC—would extend its reach into the drug fields of the Middle East and Ibero-America, as befitting its role as the financial kingpin of Dope, Inc.

             In 1783 Lord Shelbourne launched the Chinese opium trade with Scottish merchants from the East India Company and members of the House of Windsor-allied Knights of St. John Jerusalem.

            <p>
             Shelbourne’s chief propagandist was Adam Smith who worked for East India Company, which emerged from the slave-trading Levant Company and later became known as Chatham House, home to the powerful Royal Institute for International Affairs (RIIA). In 1776 the high seas pirate Adam Smith wrote Wealth of Nations, which became the bible of international capitalism....

            Post all the digging and dirt on British banks and financial institutions too they're all involved too and i think a lot of this goes back to Brexit, Rotherham sex abuse, Telford sex abuse, Westminster sex abuse, the great recession, the first tech bubble burst, and ImClone and the ImClone scandal, and 9/11/01, and Bernie Madoff, and all of the stuff with Halliburton and Cheney and the oil and defense companies, all of it, everything you can possibly post, all of it, It's all connected. This whole thing is connected and it involves basically the biggest pyramid scheme in history. Everything about about all of it is intertwined. All of it. And it all involves cheese pizza, pedophilia, human and sex trafficking, slave trafficking, racketeering, money laundering, extortion, coercion, fraud, bribery, embezzling. Financial and sexual crimes the likes of which you cant ever begin to even imagine. And drug and arms trafficking, and all of the false flags and terrorism and proxy wars and the stupid Afghanistan and Iraq wars too link to it too. And the other things that links to it all too are the shit show in Syria, Egypt, Libya, and maybe Vietnam war and Gulf war 1 and the Korean war and Ukraine war. And all the drug cartels too.

            post about Hunter Biden's Coloboma
           </p>
           <p>
            The pic sure looks like it, and do you think that Joe had to give up his wife and daughter in that accident, and then Beau to cancer and has a son with coloboma. Is there something about Beau's wife that would be an advantage to marry Hunter with the coloboma eye?
           </p>
           <p>
            So does anyone have the proper background or learned info to let us know, is there an advantage that the widow could have by marrying Hunter?  What if they had a child?  What does the widow have that would create an advantage with Breeding.

            Post everything you can about the Panama Papers and Paradise Papers. Some one post everything possible about the Panama Papers and Paradise Papers and post everything about he Vatican and/or Vatican city's connections and links to all of this racketeering, money laundering, extortion, coercion, fraud, bribery, embezzling. It's all connected and even MI5/MI6 and the royal British family is involved with all of this.

            "Think about the amount of public funding these organizations represent. Think about how much of that is going into their pockets. 
Now add the private funding and extortion proceeds they're all getting.
I'm going to call it. This shit is all ultimately going to be provably prosecutable under RICO. This is an extortion, racketeering, money laundering, and embezzling ring. There's probably actionable drug trafficking and child abuse therein too. The mafia would be proud." "These SJWs are masterful at pulling in multiple streams of revenue through grant writing and employment in political groups.
They all seem to have multiple board seats and non profit employers. I wonder what they're paying in taxes.
How many of them are guilty of fraud and tax evasion? How many of these groups do anything but exist to funnel money and write more grants to start more groups so they can funnel more money?
It's almost as if there's some sort of enormous publicly funded SJW pyramid scheme that is terrified that GG will uncover them.
Hmm. That would explain a lot." I knew i was onto something i knew i missed something. Yes.

            This Michael Schumacher gave 5-10 million $ according to the CF donor list.

              PRINCESS Marie-Chantal of Greece says she deeply regrets that pictures of her daughter’s “ostentatious” birthday party were posted on Instagram in July and has moved her family to New York to keep a lower profile.

             <p>
              The European royal’s private life was raked over by the press this summer after photos of a lavish party - thrown for both her 21-year-old daughter, Princess Maria-Olympia and her dad Pavlos, Crown Prince of Greece- in Gloucestershire emerged on photo-sharing site Instagram.
             </p>
             <p>
              High-profile guests from King Felipe of Spain, Prince Charles's goddaughter India Hicks, and Paris and Nicky Rothschild were told to “revolutionise black tie” and what followed was a host of pictures showing off the lavish bash.
             </p>
             <p>
              Prince Charles's goddaughter India Hicks had a dress shirt painted on her naked body.

              FBI’s Comey has a history as a political and corporate fixer
             </a>
            </p>
            <blockquote>
             <p>
              Comey was first appointed to the Justice Department by the Bush-Cheney administration. After they had launched the second Iraq war and committed billions to it, he was hired as consigliere and chief fixer by defense giant Lockheed Martin LMT, -1.90% . (Oh, and Lockheed has now deleted the web page announcing the appointment. How cute. Alas for them, the page has been archived.)
             </p>
             <p>
              Why would a defense contractor in Washington give a top job to a hack with no knowledge of engineering or defense work, and no military experience? You got it.
             </p>
             <p>
              For most of those years, Lockheed — and Comey — successfully hid how much he earned. But in 2009, due to some oversight, they had to disclose it in a public filing. His pay for that year alone? Try $6.1 million. No, really....
             </p>
             <p>
              ...In March, 2013, Comey was even hired as a board director by global investment bank HSBC. This was just three months after the bank had been whacked by the U.S. Justice Department for a staggering $1.3 billion for international money laundering, and faced criminal charges as well.
             </p>
             <p>
              Yes, really. Just three months.
             </p>
             <p>
              Why would a global investment bank, which desperately needed to launder its reputation in Washington, hire a political hack with no expertise in international banking? Yep. You got it.

              You forgot to add that LORETTA LYNCH was one of the federal attorneys who gave HSBC a nice monetary fine SLAP ON THE WRIST (no jail time for Mexican drug cartel money laundering). She and Comey were rewarded with FBI Chief and Attorney General!
             </p>
             <p>
              "“Today we announce the filing of criminal charges against HSBC, one of the largest financial institutions in the world,” said U.S. ATTORNEY LYNCH.  “HSBC’s blatant failure to implement proper anti-money laundering controls facilitated the laundering of at least $881 million in drug proceeds through the U.S. financial system.  HSBC’s willful flouting of U.S. sanctions laws and regulations resulted in the processing of hundreds of millions of dollars in OFAC-prohibited transactions.  Today’s historic agreement, which imposes the largest penalty in any BSA prosecution to date, makes it clear that all corporate citizens, no matter how large, must be held accountable for their actions.” "
             </p>
             <p>
              "According to court documents, from 2006 to 2010, HSBC Bank USA severely understaffed its AML compliance function and failed to implement an anti-money laundering program capable of adequately monitoring suspicious transactions and activities from HSBC Group Affilliates, particularly HSBC Mexico, one of HSBC Bank USA’s largest Mexican customers.  This included a failure to monitor billions of dollars in purchases of physical U.S. dollars, or “banknotes,” from these affiliates.  Despite evidence of serious money laundering risks associated with doing business in Mexico, from at least 2006 to 2009, HSBC Bank USA rated Mexico as “standard” risk, its lowest AML risk category.  As a result, HSBC Bank USA failed to monitor over $670 billion in wire transfers and over $9.4 billion in purchases of physical U.S. dollars from HSBC Mexico during this period, when HSBC Mexico’s own lax AML controls caused it to be the preferred financial institution for drug cartels and money launderers.
             </p>
             <p>
              A significant portion of the laundered drug trafficking proceeds were involved in the Black Market Peso Exchange (BMPE), a complex money laundering system that is designed to move the proceeds from the sale of illegal drugs in the United States to drug cartels outside of the United States, often in Colombia.  According to court documents, beginning in 2008, an investigation conducted by ICE Homeland Security Investigation’s (HSI’s) El Dorado Task Force, in conjunction with the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Eastern District of New York, identified multiple HSBC Mexico accounts associated with BMPE activity and revealed that drug traffickers were depositing hundreds of thousands of dollars in bulk U.S. currency each day into HSBC Mexico accounts.  Since 2009, the investigation has resulted in the arrest, extradition, and conviction of numerous individuals illegally using HSBC Mexico accounts in furtherance of BMPE activity.

             <p>
              As a result of HSBC Bank USA’s AML failures, at least $881 million in drug trafficking proceeds – including proceeds of drug trafficking by the Sinaloa Cartel in Mexico and the Norte del Valle Cartel in Colombia – were laundered through HSBC Bank USA.  HSBC Group admitted it did not inform HSBC Bank USA of significant AML deficiencies at HSBC Mexico, despite knowing of these problems and their effect on the potential flow of illicit funds through HSBC Bank USA."

             THANK YOU! I've posted about this before. HSBC was established by jewish Iraqi opium lord David Sassoon to bank all of their China opium trade money. The bank is incorporated in The City of London.  NOTHING HAS CHANGED. The current descendant (his Rothschild ancestor married David Sassoon) is Baron Lord James Meyer Sassoon. He was previously the head of the British Exchequer, is on the Board for the East India Company replacement, Jardine Matheson, who was involved in the China Opium Wars and is involved with China-British trade.

               "Arguably the most famous Sassoon of all is not related to Sir David’s illustrious dynasty. Vidal Sassoon (1928-2012), the legendary hair stylist who revolutionized the women’s beauty salon business with his Los Angeles-based hair products empire, grew up in the Jewish slum of London’s East End. Evacuated to the countryside during the Blitz, in 1948 he volunteered to fight with Machal (Overseas Volunteers) in the fledgling Israel Defence Force where he saw service against the Egyptian army in the Negev Desert."

                 Really stuck out to me because jeans are made of cotton, rabbinicist carpetbaggers destroyed the cotton industry in the South, and the Vanderbilt connection. The progenitor of the Vanderbilt family was Jan Aertszoon or Aertson (1620–1705).  Aert means pea in Dutch. Gloria's son, Anderson Cooper, is a Peabody Award-winning journalist, author, and television producer and personality. In Rosemary's baby, by Roman Polanski, the devils mistress came back with a haircut from Vidal Sassoon, and the husband remarked" you paid for that?" Something along those lines. Worth a re-watch for signs.

                Set up (3) is that if any of this goes down, Penn will drop them even if they are part of the cabal. Heck, they may have administration getting paid right now that are under understandable investigation. I would imagine that there are more than a few countries on the planet that would be willing to drop a dime on any information that could help.

                 These morons (Joe and Zeke) need to be brought down off their high horse.  They all think they can rule the world and everyone is falling for grooming tactics, which many are.  But how long can this go on?  Centuries ago,  the Old Cabal was close to being brought done, but they rose up again.  It's going to take a lot to get to that point again, to try to take them down.

                   30% of the world is very evil.  That's hard to take.  But probably true, especially now.

                     I know what you mean.  They make things the way the are for us, so they can have the power.  I will never know what it's like to be rich.  Not even close. But thank God I don't do what they do.

                        Understanding what true value is, before the market realizes it, is the key to riches. The hard part is having the liquidity to wait that long, unless you really pay attention to market forces and act accordingly.

               The Patriarch
              </p>
              <p>
               Benjamin M. Emanuel (né Auerbach) is a Chicago pediatrician and former member of Irgun. He is the father of NIH bioethicist Ezekiel J. Emanuel, U.S. Congressman and White House Chief of Staff-designate Rahm Emanuel, talent agent Ari Emanuel, and adopted daughter Shoshana. Benjamin Auerbach was born in Jerusalem in 1927, the son of pharmacists who left Russia for Palestina. The family adopted the surname Emanuel in 1933, after Benjamin’s brother, Emanuel Auerbach, was killed in a skirmish with Arabs in Jerusalem. In the 1940s, Benjamin Emanuel interrupted his medical school training in Switzerland to take part in an unsuccessful scheme to smuggle guns from Czechoslovakia to the Israeli underground. He later served as a medic in the 1948 Israeli war of stealing Palestina from its righteous inhabitants.
              </p>
              <p>
               In 1953, his medical training brought him to Chicago's Mount Sinai hospital, where he met X-ray technician Marsha Smulevitz, the daughter of a Moldavian immigrant and union organizer. The couple married and briefly lived in Israel before returning to Chicago. They had three sons within four years, and according to Benjamin Emanuel, named their second son in honor of Rahamim, a Lehi combatant who was killed. They later moved to Wilmette and adopted their daughter. Benjamin sent his sons to summer camp in Israel, and Marsha insisted they take ballet lessons and accompany her to civil rights protests, where she was arrested three times. Dr. Emanuel's pediatrics practice grew to one of the largest in Chicago.
              </p>
              <p>
               Rahm Emanuel has Dual Citizenship.  I bet they all do.

              I agree.  There's more going on 'between the lines' of that article.  Biden's relationship with Penn University has always been a red flag with me - don't know why.

              Agree it needs to be looked into. I'll have a look tomorrow (if I remember). For now, other posts:

               Delaware is a Cesspool.  I will look into this.  His connection with Penn also sets off Alarm Bells for me.  Especially since Ezekiel Emanuel is also there.  Possibly creating some kind of NWO Grouping.  There is Jill with the Gender thing,  Joe with Global Sustainability  and Ezekiel is a whole other problem.  Zeke helped write the ACA for Obama.  Gulp.

               There is an Ice Cream Place that Biden goes to as well, that has been posted on here.

               Hot sauce Hall of Famer Chip Hearn, who owns the Ice Cream Store in Rehoboth, expects the same. Biden is a noted ice cream fan. On the walls inside Hearn's ice cream shop are pictures of Biden from previous summers, smiling big with workers young and old.
              </p>
              <p>
               The Ice Cream Store is located on The Boardwalk

               Close proximity to Washington, D.C., Philadelphia and Baltimore: Only a short drive from several cities that have large gay communities, it’s easy to see why Gay Rehoboth Beach has become such a popular spot for gays and lesbians on the east coast.
              </p>
              <p>
               Rehoboth Beach is located in Delaware, as popular for it tax shelter status as it is for its clean beaches and gay friendly status. There are hundreds of gay owned and operated businesses patronized by a population that swells in the summer months. The BOARDWALK  is a great place to people watch at night and there are several nightlife options. Make sure to check-in to one of the many gay friendly B&amp;B’s and check out the gay beaches to get that tan!

             Does Hunter have Coloboma?  Possibly.  The whole mess with Beau dying of Brain Cancer and his brother Hunter marrying Beau's Widow sounds like some Mexican Novella.  Could we even make that up?  There has got to be more to that story.

             Also, there is something fishy about  Joe moving over to Penn campus.  Of all people.  Will he have any connection to the old Sandysky Charity Second Mile?  Hmm.  I will look.

              If only people knew what they were up to.  Actually sinful.  Stealing money from the rich is alright with me, most of them are not doing any good, but the poor, especially Children, that is a Crime Against God.

                The have no intention of following The Golden Rule.  They are TPTB. I am glad they are miserable.  Imagine what it is like pretending constantly in front of your rich friends, how happy you are.  What a life.
