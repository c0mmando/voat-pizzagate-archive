<blockquote>
<p>Trump intends to appoint Feinberg, the co-founder and co-chief executive officer of Cerberus Capital Management in New York, to chair the President’s Intelligence Advisory Board, which plays a role in overseeing the intelligence community, deriving its influence from direct access to the president and his senior staff.</p>
<p>Among Cerberus’ holdings is the military contractor <a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1562363">DynCorp International</a>, which receives the vast majority of its $3 billion in annual revenues from the federal government.</p>
<p>The New York Times reported last July that Steve Bannon, then the White House chief strategist, and Jared Kushner, the president’s son-in-law and adviser, had asked Feinberg, as well as Blackwater founder Erik Prince, for proposals to send private-sector workers to Afghanistan in place of American troops. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>To be sure, that Trump is putting someone in charge of the Presidential Intelligence Advisory Board is potentially a good thing. As Foreign Policy noted, Trump had failed to nominate anyone to the board until recently. There have been reports the president might tap another billionaire — venture capitalist Peter Thiel — to the oversight role, but apparently he didn’t get the job.  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Cerberus Capital, one of Wall Street’s most notoriously ruthless leveraged-buyout firms (or “private equity firms” in PC-speak), recently made a $1.8 billion killing on its human plasma investment, a company called Talecris. Talecris was purchased for a mere $82.5 million just four years earlier, meaning Cerberus made 23 times its investment on human plasma. This was accomplished by the most savage, heartless means possible: by paying peanuts to impoverished human plasma donors, who increasingly come from Mexican border towns to blood-pumping stations set up on the American side, jacking up the price of plasma by restricting supply (a lawsuit filed by the Federal Trade Commission accusedCerberus Plasma Holdings of “operat[ing] as an oligopoly”), and then selling the refined products to the most desperately ill—patients suffering from hemophilia, severe burns, multiple sclerosis and autoimmune deficiencies. The products cost so much—one, IVIG (intravenous immunoglobulin) cost twice the price of gold as of last summer—that American health insurance companies have been dropping or denying their policyholders in increasing numbers, endangering untold numbers of people.</p>

<p>There are many examples of this among the elite that need some digging, from Peter Thiel investing in and reportedly receiving transfusion of young blood to rumors of Keith Richards receiving full blood transplants, to allegations that Al Gore had bags of his own andrenalized blood at an airport.
The oxidation of epinephrine, which occurs in human blood when adrenaline is introduced, is called Adrenochrome, and is thought to have euphoric and psychoactive effects when ingested. It is theorized that the elite satanists torture and abuse their victims to create adrenaline in their blood, which is then ingested or removed from the spinal column as adrenochrome.</p>

            Ugh.  Roald Dahl. I used to give out his books to kids when I volunteered at a school.  Now it makes me sick.  The kids loved him, so I picked his books.  So sickening.  Feinberg over Thiel is it any better?  Yes, what does it all mean.

              Thirty years ago, as much of the world was being ravaged by horrific diseases like HIV/AIDS and tuberculosis, three remarkable young people, barely out of their teens—Jim Yong Kim, Paul Farmer, Ophelia Dahl—came together in a squatter settlement in Haiti.
             </p>
             <p>
              They managed to bring together the resources to build real health clinics in areas that had been ignored by everyone else—where patients were as likely to arrive by donkey as by ambulance—and stocked them with the same medical supplies that could be found in places like Harvard Medical School. (Indeed, in some cases, supplies that were found at Harvard made their way to Haiti.)

             <p>
              It’s been one year since the UN imported cholera to Haiti. Nearly 500,000 Haitians have been infected and over 6, 500 have been killed. But UN representative, Paul Farmer, is obviously the “impartial one” the Associated Press is going to as “expert” to speak on the situation.
             </p>
             <p>
              In the October 18, AP Interview , after Paul ”the god – Farmer relieves himself on Haiti’s dying cholera victims, Trenton Daniels of the AP continues in the same vein, to say, that the negligence of the UN contractor (Haitian, of course) caused the contamination of the Meye River. Just for kicks, I figure I’ll take the time and point out the Nepalese soldiers crap was leaking STRAIGHT from their toilets into the Meye River. (See the UN Final Report, May 5, 2011.)

             And while I am at it, for those dying of Farmer’s UN cholera in Port au Prince right now, why not also point out that the &gt;Nepalese contingent, never quarantined or punished, continued this year to poison Haiti’s waterways as seen in these pictures and video:

               For many years, the children in the town of Mirebalais; located 34.4 miles from Port-Au-Prince, have been disappearing; and most of them have fallen victim of rampant organ harvesting; constant flow of kidnappings; and child exploitation, after the January 12, 2010 earthquake.

              <p>
               At the center of the organ harvesting business is a hospital in the town of Mirebalais. That hospital has rapidly become the focus of a growth organ transplant industry center; an onsite health service; a sort of slaughterhouse; where the organs of unsuspecting Haitians are harvested and sold.

              Vomit.  Vomit.  That's all I feel like after reading some of these links and your report.  Sick and Disgusted Beyond Words!!!  Haiti has been completely taken over by Criminal Mafia Actors since the Clintons first arrived on the Island on their Honeymoon and their eyes must have Lit Up when they thought of the Golden Opportunities.  Here is a piece from the Cholera Link:
             </p>
             <p>
              Of course said UN representative is telling all and sundry that Haiti is dirty and that’s why the outbreak is so ‘freaking’ severe. Not that lives would have been saved if clean water and sanitation, which the UN says is a human right, had been a funded relief priority perhaps as soon as the outbreak began, or maybe even seven years ago when the UN “peacekeepers” came to “help” Haitians? Or, maybe sometime before when President Aristide tried to bring desperately needed water and sanitation to Haiti but first the Clinton Administration and then the George W. Bush Administration forced the already approved Inter-American Development Bank (IDB) loans to Haiti to be blocked.
             </p>
             <p>
              Shame Shame Shame.  They and those that have ignored the history of Haiti must all hang their heads in Shame.  But they must all be thrown in a Cell and Left To Rot.

                Disgusting.  This is Bill Clinton's plan with Sustainability.  Not only does Haiti not have clean water, they are pulling this garbage all over starting with Detroit and Flint Mi.  and Benton Harbor as well.  Many states now are loaded with lead in their water as well.  I read the other day that the Rothschilds hold all rights to all global water.  This is Beyond Frightening.  They are trying to get people to fall for putting some water meters pushed by large cities that claim to save money on water when in reality they cost more.  This will lead to privatization of our Water Supply.   Dangerous.

                  In a 2016 document, the Defense Department named 393 installations known or are suspected of being contaminated with cancer-causing chemicals. This included six North Carolina’s Fort Bragg, Cherry Point, Charlotte Air National Guard Base, Seymour Johnson Air Force Base, and Stanly County Airport. This prompted the government to spend over $800,000 to look into the problems in these areas.

                  The issue is not limited to North Carolina alone. The Navy is conducting tests and cleanup at Whidbey Island Naval Air Station near Seattle, at the former Warminster Naval Air Warefare Center and the former Naval Air Station Willow Grove near Philadelphia and other facilities all over the U.S. (Related: Now Detroit is dealing with toxic chemicals in the drinking water.)

                  Someone is Spiking Our Water.  I don't think hiring the head of Dyncorp will solve this problem.  Isnt there proof of Welch and his father having been in Haiti?  Anyone with connections to Haiti can also be suspected of doing almost anything, especially having connections to Cape Fear as well.  Also the Military is not exempt. The Navy and the Army like the US Army Corps of Engineers I am sure have been used by unsavory characters.  Like in Katrina.

            We are winning, Trump picks a Dyncorp investor! This goes nice with his Rothschild, Rockefeller, CIA, Zionist, Jesuit, Clinton and Epstein connections, not to mention his mentor the late great Roy Cohn. He is so good at fighting for us, that there are zero PG arrest, and the public thinks it is fake news. We are winning!

             He also just signed some legislation that will try to force Poland to pay "holocaust" reparations. He personally did a 100 billion dollar weapons deal with Saudia Arabia so that they can continue to terrorize Israel's enemies and continue the "Greater Israel" project.

             Why did the Cockatoo-in-Chief renege on the Iran deal deeply prized by Russia, China, France, Germany, England, and the European Union? Why did he deliberately damage relations with Europe and cost American workers many thousands of jobs at Boeing among others? Why do all of this to hurt a country that poses no danger to the United States?

             The oxidation of epinephrine, which occurs in human blood when adrenaline is introduced, is called Adrenochrome, and is thought to have euphoric and psychoactive effects when ingested. It is theorized that the elite satanists torture and abuse their victims to create adrenaline in their blood, which is then ingested or removed from the spinal column as adrenochrome.

            There is no proof/scientific working theory regarding adrenochrome. But parabiosis is something that should be looked into.

             A mod comes in here to do damage control. You have to work on picking your spots, we know you will rush in here like this. Save it for the big stuff. We do know that 'they" seem to think it is true about adrenochrome, and they are about symbolism, not truth.

              Oh, I have been trying to think of that name for a while.  Epstein has been after finding the solution to Eternal Life for some time.  Yes P Thiel is a perfect accomplice.  I also found this abut Epstein:     He dresses casually -- jeans, open-necked shirts, and sneakers -- and is rarely seen in a tie. Indeed, those close to him say the reason he quit his board seat at the Rockefeller Institute was that he hated wearing a suit. "It feels like a dress," he told one friend.  Board Seat at the Rockefeller Institute.  Either I never knew this or had forgotten it.   I feel there could be some nefarious and illegal experiments being performed at this Lifeboat Found.  Blood.  Children.  What in the world are they doing there?
