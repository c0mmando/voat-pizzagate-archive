<blockquote>
<p>What we now call “intergenerational fairness” has suffered a lot lately, and it’s not about to be improved by the news that the Baby Boomers are sucking the blood of the young. Although, in fairness, they are only after the plasma...Ambrosia, the vampiric startup concerned, is run by a 32-year-old doctor called Jesse Karmazin, who bills $8,000 (£6,200) a pop for participation in what he has dubbed a “study”. So far, he has 600 clients, with a median age of 60. The blood is collected from local blood banks, then separated and combined – it takes multiple donors to make one package.</p>
<p>Mike Judge’s Silicon Valley sitcom recently parodied the notion, with arch-tech guru Gavin Belson relying on a “blood boy” following him around to donate pints of sticky red at inopportune moments.
That fictionalised account may well be based on the real-life adventures of Peter Thiel, the PayPal founder, who has expressed interest in having transfusions (Gawker even reported that he was spending $40,000 (£31,000) a quarter on regular transfusions from 18-year-olds). He, and various other thinkers who radiate out towards the <strong>death-evading “transhumanist” movement</strong>, are fascinated by <strong>“heterochronic parabiosis”</strong> – the sewing together of two animals in order to create a living chimera.  Studies going back decades show the regenerative effects of one organism being joined to another. In the 17th century, Robert Boyle – he of Boyle’s Law – suggested <strong>“replacing the blood of the old with the blood of the young”</strong>.</p>
<p>In 2012, the University of Cambridge’s Dr Robin Franklin led a group that showed blood from young mice could replace myelin sheaths – crucial for combatting MS in older mice. But it was a 2014 Harvard report that seems to have kickstarted the present revival of interest in transfusions. </p>

<p>The UN and the Solvay drug family castle in Belgium had all kinds of rituals and kids, hunting parties, MK Ultra and the altar in the backyard with <strong>1000 points of lights</strong>. However, google has scrubbed a lot of the Solvay castle off the internet. The Mothers of Darkness castle. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Closely tied to Solvay are Abbott who purchased the company years ago, and SC Johnson who is a major player in elite global corruption. The &quot;root&quot; of all Evil is in Racine, Wisconsin which behind the real agenda of global enslavement and the Mark of the Beast.</p>
<p>One of the key elements they are pushing now is mental health, also tied to global education reform. Racine, Wisconsin is where these programs and models are all developed.</p>

            Nice roundup of past research, LDT. We need more such.

            I think one of the reasons we see so much crazy, unsourced shit pushed about "adrenochrome" is because those paid to muddy the waters here are trying to build a "foil" for parabiosis -- which actually has scientific support, and poses a MUCH more logical and tempting reason to genotype and "harvest" children (as young as possible, no less). The tactic is called a "flooding fake". They're also trying to normalize the idea with stuff like "vampire facials".

            Robert Boyle and corpuscular alchemy - 2006 article :

           <blockquote>
            <p>
             Every survey of the scientific revolution highlights the importance of Boyle's mechanical philosophy, but the precise relationship of this doctrine to the immediate matter theory that it replaced has until now received uniformly short shrift. Few historians have appreciated the fact that the mechanical philosophy, as formulated by Robert Boyle, was itself the capstone to a preexisting tradition employing alchemy to recast scholastic theories of mixture, an attempt at reform whose roots extended well into the Middle Ages. Nor do we find a common awareness of the fact that Boyle's most significant experimental evidence for the persistence of microlevel corpuscles and for the mechanical character of the accidental qualities induced upon and removed from those corpuscles stemmed from the reduction to the pristine state originating in the alchemical tradition and made famous in the early seventeenth century by Daniel Sennert. The radical character of these claims justifies some comment from a methodological perspective. Despite the novelty of its results, the picture that this book paints of medieval and early modern matter theory employs traditional tools of textual scholarship and intellectual history to subvert the complacent story that has become canonical in the existing surveys of the scientific revolution.

            <p>
             In optics, the corpuscular theory of light, arguably set forward by Descartes (1637) states that light is made up of small discrete particles called "corpuscles" (little particles) which travel in a straight line with a finite velocity and possess impetus. This was based on an alternate description of atomism of the time period. This theory cannot explain refraction, diffraction, interference and polarization.
            </p>
            <p>
             Isaac Newton was a pioneer of this theory, ..
            </p>
            <p>
             Robert Boyle was a strong proponent of corpuscularianism and used the theory to exemplify the differences between a vacuum and a plenum, by which he aimed to further support his mechanical philosophy and overall atomist theory.[2] About a half-century after Gassendi, Isaac Newton used existing corpuscular theories to develop his particle theory of the physics of light.[3]

             <blockquote>
              <p>
               Theory of Colours (German: Zur Farbenlehre) is a book by Johann Wolfgang von Goethe about the poet's views on the nature of colours and how these are perceived by humans. It was published in German in 1810 and in English in 1840.[2] The book contains detailed descriptions of phenomena such as coloured shadows, refraction, and chromatic aberration.
              </p>
              <p>
               The work originated in Goethe's occupation with painting and mainly exerted an influence on the arts (Philipp Otto Runge, J. M. W. Turner, the Pre-Raphaelites, Wassily Kandinsky). The book is a successor to two short essays entitled "Contributions to Optics".

             Burroughs Wellcome and Tavistock are linked. Burroughs Wellcome out of UK has had a HQ in Raleigh NC at the research triangle. Near by are two very large state mental hospitals and two very large prisons. ..(one mental hospital closed down) BUT Comet Ping Pong has had two doors with Well on one and Come on the other ....Ft Bragg close by has been mentioned for  MKUltra programming as well as Duke University.Burroughs Wellcome has merged with Glaxco Smith Kline."investigation into financials shows that the Rothschilds, Rockefellers are major funders of Wellcome and have worked as researchers for them. An international art therapy program operating out of Baltimore and Switzerland links Tony Podesta to the former and Alefantis to the latter.
            </p>
            <p>
             Links show Jimmy Savile was also involved in this program at the hospital where he abused hundreds, and that Kim Noble was one of its victims."https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/7ww58g/evidence_links_tony_podesta_james_alefantis_jimmy/"
