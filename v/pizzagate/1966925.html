<p>GOP operative worked with hackers to get Clinton\'s emails dies 10 days after press asks him about it.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Mr. Smith died at age 81 on May 14, which was about 10 days after the Journal interviewed him. His account of the email search is believed to be his only public comment on it.</p>
<p>Before the 2016 presidential election, a longtime Republican opposition researcher mounted an independent campaign to obtain emails he believed were stolen from Hillary Clinton’s private server, likely by Russian hackers.
In conversations with members of his circle and with others he tried to recruit to help him, the GOP operative, Peter W. Smith, implied he was working with retired Lt. Gen. Mike Flynn, at the time a senior adviser to then-candidate Donald Trump.
“He said, ‘I’m talking to Michael Flynn about this—if you find anything, can you let me know?’” said Eric York, a computer-security expert from Atlanta who searched hacker forums on Mr. Smith’s behalf for people who might have access to the emails.
.......,..We told all the groups to give them to WikiLeaks,” he said. WikiLeaks has never published those emails or claimed to have them.
.....
Emails written by Mr. Smith and one of his associates show that his small group considered Mr. Flynn and his consulting company, Flynn Intel Group, to be allies in their quest 
What role, if any, Mr. Flynn may have played in Mr. Smith’s project is unclear. In an interview with The Wall Street Journal, Mr. Smith said he knew Mr. Flynn, but he never stated that Mr. Flynn was involved.
Mr. Flynn didn’t respond to requests for comment.</p>

             He has a ton of connections to the Russian mob.    And since that started in the Soviet days.  The biggest Russian mobster is Ukranian, the Russia thing is really the ex Soviet thing.
            </p>
            <p>
             He also knew a bunch of NY mobsters too.  His biggest client at his casino was a mob associate and Trump gave him the royal treatment including socializing with him, flying with him in his helicopter from NYC to AC and removing any black or women dealers when he came to gamble..  He was involved in business with a construction racketeer named Dan Sullivan.  Trump used to brag that Sullivan killed Jimmy Hoffa. Trump Tower is said the be one of the tallest buildings in NY that used mainly ready-mix concrete.  He built it at a time when everyone knew concrete prices in NY were inflated due to the mafia cartel and ready-mix meant any labor stoppage was incredibly costly.  He bought his concrete from a company owned by Fat Tony Salerno and Paul Castellano.  He also had a subcontractor using Illegal Polish immigrants do the demolition on the previous building.   There was basically no way non-union workers would get on a high-profile Manhattan construction site unless someone was paid off. In this case, Fat Tony controlled that union.
            </p>
            <p>
             His entry into New York Society was helped by his mentor Roy Cohn (who also mentored Roger Stone.) Cohn was famous as McCarthy's aide during 50's, but by the 70s and 80s he was Fat Tony's lawyer.  My suspicion is Trump cut a deal, if I get part of the skim, I'll buy a lot more concrete from you.
            </p>
            <p>
             He bought the property for his first casino from the Philadelphia mob.  One of the Seller's father's was memorialized in the Bruce Springsteen song Atlantic City.
            </p>
            <p>
             <em>
              Well they blew up the

              and the blew up his house too
             </em>
            </p>
            <p>
             When he applied for a casino license, he lied on the application about some of his unsavory associates.  The guy who ran his helicopter service was charged with cocaine trafficking, Trump vouched for his character in a letter to the court.   Later when a reporter asked about him, Trump say he barely knew the guy.
            </p>

             Trump's Taj Mahal had to pay the biggest fine ever for money-laundering violations by a casino.  Two years ago, they paid the biggest fine again.   I believe both times the Russian mob was involved.  By the second time, he had nothing to do with the casino.

             I don't know what the Russian Jewish mafia is, but the East European mobster who was closest to Trump, Felix Sater is Russian-Jewish.  He was involved in the type of Wall Street pump and dump stock schemes they showed in the Wolf of Wall Street.  He was working most of the NY mafia families on that scheme.  There's a very detailed website online about that scam if you're interested.
            </p>
            <p>
             Sater went on to become a cooperating witness in that case.  After that he went to work for the company that was financing a lot of Trump's projects including Trump Soho

             Donald claimed not to know who he was in a 2008 deposition.
             <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/former-mafia-linked-figure-describes-association-with-trump/2016/05/17/cec6c2c6-16d3-11e6-aa55-670cabef46e0_story.html?utm_term=.dfa46e7c6db9">
              Video here.

            <p>
             Sater is on the right here.  He is currently in a fight with the the other man in this picture, Tevfik Arif, who also ex-Soviet.  He is demanded to be compensated for $3.5 million in legal fees or else he will release some information he has.  He claims this info will lead to headlines like:
The Kazakh Gangster and President Trump
            </p>
            <p>
             This year he gave a Trump's Lawyer Cohen a plan to lift sanctions on Russia.  Cohen gave that to Michael Flynn before he was fired.
            </p>
            <p>
             Cohen's business partner Evgeny Freidman was just arrested on tax fraud.  There was also a mass arrest of a Russian gambling ring in NYC with some big names arrested.  People speculate these two are connected.
            </p>
            <p>
             We New Yorkers knew Trump was never going to drain the swamp, we know what he is.  He's a fugazy.

             AreWeSure you're just setting yourself up for a massive disappointment later this year. The BEST evidence you guys had was Russian Hookers giving golden showers and that lasted about a New York Minute. In fact it's worse than that it completely destroyed your credibility.

              You know you've been telling this for months now right?  Like you told me this before Trump lawyered up, before Sessions lawyered up, before Kushner lawyered up, before Kushner Lawyered up again.   He just added another lawyer, a top notch trial lawyer to his team, Abbe Lowell.
             </p>
             <p>
              Hell this was even before Trump's lawyer lawyered up.
             </p>
             <p>
              It was before Flynn cleaned up his status and registered as a foreign agent, before Manafort cleaned up his status and registered as a foreign agent.

               More bad news AreWeSure. Charles Ortel just ripped the ass out of your Clinton Foundation defense:

              </p>
              <p>
               Sorry about that, it looks like it's game over for Hillary Clinton. We knew this already but I didn't realize there were so many laws in place to prevent exactly what the Clinton Foundation ended up doing. Charles Ortel goes over the myriad of violations and it's not going to be pretty when Hillary gets in front of a judge and jury.

               I want to find out what Charles Ortel knows, sounds juicy. Who's he? He's kind of like Peter Schweizer but Jewish. The similarity being the fact they're both

               Ortel famously said:

              <blockquote>
               <p>
                “Terry McAuliffe made it possible for the Clinton’s to buy their house in Chappaqua. That’s a significant financial relationship that should have been disclosed in the 990’s (tax return) and was not. And has never been corrected”
               </p>
              </blockquote>
              <p>
               Actually a lot of people have given up their membership to the Bill and Hillary Clinton fan club. Did you see the paragraph about Liberal Activist Peter Wertheimer? It's about his outrage regarding Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe's $1.35 million "gift" to Bill and Hillary to buy their house in Chappaqua NY.
              </p>
              <p>
               Why do I get the feeling you don't consider that a problem? Oh I know! It was kind of like when you didn't think it was a problem Terry McAuliffe gave

               "lawyered up"
              </p>
              <p>
               After 9 continuous months of accusing Trump of paying Russians to hack into the DNC the former head of the FBI said there is no evidence to support the charge. THE FORMER HEAD OF THE FBI said that along with numerous other intelligence and Law Enforcement officials.
              </p>
              <p>
               Any rational person would conclude, duh, there is no evidence. So the Deep State pressing this investigation very much looks like a Witch Hunt. Remember what a Witch Hunt is? You used that very same term to describe what was happening to James Alefantis and Comet Ping Pong. And you were right! There was no evidence to support the charge.
              </p>
              <p>
               Therefor if the Deep State persists at this point this is now officially a Witch Hunt and "lawyering up" is exactly what any sane person would do when they learn people are trying to frame them.

            " In an interview with The Wall Street Journal, Mr. Smith said he knew Mr. Flynn, but he never stated that Mr. Flynn was involved. "
           </p>
           <p>
            Again with the Russian hackers. AreWeSure James Comey, Andrew McCabe and John Brennan have all said there's no evidence Trump was involved in "Russian Hacking".
           </p>
           <p>
            The head of intelligence and the FBI at the time repeatedly state over and over again there is nothing to the story. Even Barack Obama felt there wasn't enough evidence to launch an investigation.
           </p>
           <p>
            And even the WSJ quotes the "witness" as saying "he never stated that Mr. Flynn was involved.". How desperate can you people get? The star witness is dead and he even is quoted in a major national newspaper saying he never claimed Flynn was involved!

            I'd say you people are on a Witch Hunt but that would insult witch hunting. You're on a delusional tin foil hat expedition.
