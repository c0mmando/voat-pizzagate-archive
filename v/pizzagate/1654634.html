            Cathy Agnew Twitter Account – Examining the Possibilities of whether Cathy is making the 2017 Tweets
           </p>
           <p>
            Let’s examine the number of possibilities that exist with the Cathy Agnew Twitter accounts.
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             Scenario 1: 
2011 Tweets were made by Cathy Agnew.
2017 Tweets were not made by Cathy Agnew.
            </p>
            <p>
             Scenario 2:
2011 Tweets were made by Cathy Agnew.
2017 Tweets were made by Cathy Agnew.
            </p>
            <p>
             Scenario 3:
2011 Tweets were not made by Cathy Agnew.
2017 Tweets were not made by Cathy Agnew.
            </p>
           </blockquote>
           <p>
            <strong>
             Let’s consider Scenario 3 first. (2011=No, Cathy, 2017=No, Cathy)
            </strong>
           </p>
           <p>
            If the Tweets were not made by Cathy Agnew in 2011, what would have been the point of someone else making these tweets?
If these Tweets were in fact “backdated” by Twitter, then why? What purpose would be accomplished by doing this? Would anyone benefit from this?
Why would the fake tweeter choose Cathy Agnew as the tweeter for the 2011 tweets? Why Cathy’s identity?
           </p>
           <p>
            <strong>
             Scenario 2
            </strong>
            Analysis (2011=Yes, Cathy, 2017=Yes, Cathy):-
           </p>
           <p>
            Cathy was alerted to interest in her tweets when someone tweeted one of the old accounts. Cathy began anew to communicate with limited resources.  She does not cross contaminate the accounts on her mobile device.  Her writing style has changed over the last six years, just as her mental and physical health could have waxed and waned over the same time period.
           </p>
           <p>
            <strong>
             Scenario 3 Analysis (2011=Yes, Cathy, 2017=No, Cathy):
            </strong>
           </p>
           <p>
            We are assuming that 2011 Tweets are Cathy.
            <br/>
            Assuming that the 2017 Tweets are not Cathy, we have the following possibilities:
           </p>
           <ul>
            <li>
             A.	The 2017 Tweets are shill or troll people.
            </li>
            <li>
             B.	The 2017 Tweets are to inform people.
            </li>
           </ul>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             Possibility A:  Shills/Trolls are using this account.  What purpose would it serve?
             <br/>
             To send researchers on a wild goose chase? (distraction)
To misdirect researchers away from the 2011 tweets? (misdirection)
To plant information that is not true? (misinformation)
            </p>
            <p>
             Possibility B:
             <br/>
             Someone with information about the case is using this opportunity to leak information to researchers under the guise of Cathy’s identity. 
Someone is using this account to get the information out to the general public via Twitter so that more people are exposed to the information, and perhaps get it trending.
            </p>
           </blockquote>
           <p>
            In order to determine the greater likelihood of possibility of A or B, you can apply the following questions:
Does the content of the 2017 tweets support or add to the information in the 2011 tweets? Then the possibility of B is more likely.
Does the content of the 2017 tweets distract from or contradict the 2011 information? Then the possibility of A is more likely.
           </p>
           <p>
            If the content furthers the investigation, then there is a serious possibility that we have an anon leaker that is communicating with researchers.
           </p>
           <p>
            AND-even if it is determined that 2017 Tweets are Trolls/Shills, does that invalidate the information communicated in the 2011 Tweets?

            Sorry, I feel like I'm spamming this post in a couple of boards but it is only because I really believe I know who Catherine Agnew is. Hear me out:
           </p>
           <p>
            I think I know who Catherine Agnew is (or I least have seen her a few times).
           </p>
           <p>
            Back in 2010/2011 I was finishing my engineering degree and would often study at the Sachem Public Library (mentioned in Tweets). I would often use the Internet cafe for hours on end. There was a older white women who would walked into the cafe, sit down at the computer and type long messages, she seemed mentally unhealthy, distraught sometimes, talking out loud to the whole cafe as she typed. I always thought she was homeless, because she was at the library as much as I was.
           </p>
           <p>
            I have a strong suspicion this is Ms Agnew.
           </p>
           <p>
            I bet you money, if she could still be using that Internet cafe.

            I found another Twitter account I've been reading. All the information before the new year has been deleted or scrubbed. It is quite odd what she posts, I think it's worth looking at but I don't know how to archive.  She also sounds multiple personality or schizo and she tweets and tweets and no one responds. Ever.  Should I post her twitter handle?

            She also says the state of Florida owes her $100 billion dollars. And then she says $300 billion so she is more than a little off if there is any truth to any of it. But a lot of it seems a bit too specific to be just pulled out of thin air.

Google is finally showing results:

            So looks like either these Twitter accounts are new, or the caching only started because of us linking to those accounts just now....

            The scrambled nature of the writing is typical for people claiming to be TI (targeted individuals). Years ago I happened upon a collection of blogs by an ex MI-5/6 that have the same scattered random typing style and incomplete thoughts. They were allegedly by ex MI-5 Chief Eliza Manningham-Buller and described in detail intel org satanic meetings. At the time it was the weirdest thing I've ever read on the web and although I was pretty red-pilled the details in the blogs seemed too outlandish. But after PG it all seems very possible. The tl;dr is that  even the heads of the spy agencies are MK'd and sometimes their minds shatter and they spill all the secrets but in a shizoid way so they just seem crazy. But this lady wasn't a nobody and the blogs stayed up and multiplied with similar names/titles much the same way OP describes. She claims to be the real author of Harry Potter.
           </p>
           <p>
            I checked around and it seems they might still be online if anyone is curious. I try to go there and I get the message "firefox says insecure connection". I did find a list at makow's site henrymakow.com/mi-5_and_mi-6_wreak_havoc_for.html which I'll paste below.
           </p>
           <p>
            Sensitive people who might feel a bit shaky with all this PG info might want to give it a pass, if it's the same stuff I read, it's gruesome and fucking weird. But braver people might find familiar names or details that can inform the investigation. The whole list on makow's site is here and includes other intelligence leaders who've gone the same route.

             Stella Rimington, a director of MI-5 in the 1990's is a former secretary who did sexual entrapment for MI-5 before becoming a S/M lesbian. She had her agents steal the MI-6 mind control codes and used them to break out of her own mind control and "attack the system from outside." When she started assassinating MI-6 agents who annoyed her, she was ungracefully retired. "She has been involved in child trafficking and prostitution ever since."

             This topic is exactly about that: we should confirm or disprove that they are actually from 2011. Could be someone working for Twitter faking these. We need some other cache outside of twitter to timestamp them.

            This exact possibility occurred to me.  Her tweets sound like she is a schizo, lots of all caps, words running together, sometimes indecipherable.  She says
            <a href="https://twitter.com/catherineagnew1/status/115161685903409152">
             all kinds of crazy shit
            </a>
            .  This could easily be a disinfo campaign to get us discredited for promoting what seem like the ramblings of a lunatic.  We know Twitter has been censoring pizzagate, so it's definitely possible they are allowing a spook to pull shenanigans.
           </p>
           <p>
            It's also possible that the only reason she's alive is that she sounds nuts, but we need to be really careful with this one.  Flairing this post as important.
