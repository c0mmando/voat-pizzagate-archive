            I'll bet anything the "Russian adoptions" story is just as horrifying, if not more so. I wonder if the arrest of the head of a Russian crime syndicate, Razhden Shulaya, on June 7, 2017, had anything to do with the subsequent revelation a few weeks later of the Donald Trump Jr meeting at the Trump Tower with the Russian lawyer.
           </p>
           <p>
            If you recall, Don Trump Jr gave a statement on July 8, 2017, and described the meeting thus:
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             We primarily discussed a program about the adoption of Russian children that was active and popular with American families years ago and was since ended by the Russian government,
            </p>
           </blockquote>
           <p>
            <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/donald-trump-jr-statement-adoptions-putin-meeting-2017-8">
             <em>
              Business Insider
             </em>
            </a>
            claims Donald Trump Jr's statement was crafted by his father one day after the President met with Vladimir Putin at the G10 summit on July 7 in Hamburg:
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             And it was crafted by the president one day after he discussed "adoptions" with Russian President Vladimir Putin during a dinner at the G20 summit.
            </p>
           </blockquote>
           <p>
            Asked about the G20 summit meeting with Putin, Trump said they talked about "Russian adoptions"
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             Asked about that dinner later, Trump told the New York Times that he and Putin "just talked about things. Actually, it was very interesting; we talked about adoptions.
            </p>
           </blockquote>
           <p>
            The Kremlin confirmed that "Russian adoptions" were the topic of discussion between Trump and Putin:
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             Russian President Vladimir Putin and US President Donald Trump discussed the issue of adoptions at the G20 summit dinner two weeks ago, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Thursday.
            </p>
            <p>
             "I can confirm indeed this topic was touched upon. I cannot say more than that," Peskov said.
            </p>
           </blockquote>
           <p>
            However, Peskov emphasized that lifting the ban on Russian adoptions was NOT what was discussed:
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             When asked whether the law banning adoptions of Russian children by US citizens could be reconsidered, the Kremlin spokesman said "this is not under discussion."
            </p>
           </blockquote>
           <p>
            Were Trump and Putin discussing the Russian Mafia's crime syndicate's human trafficking network? Was Donald Trump Jr's statement a warning to the rest of the child trafficking network that they were on Trump's radar?

            CNN needs to get ahead of the story by making it look like it's about adoption. Sure, plenty of people buy children the same way you might buy a dog. They want to give a child a home, but the selectiveness and bias of the adoption system (so as to funnel orphans into the trafficking industry and worse) prevents them from adopting in the conventional way, so they have to wave some money around. The problem is that more children are likely sold in shadier places, looked at in a less loving way.

            And some still are kept by the CIA, tortured for no reason but to induce a psychotic break, given fake life stories and fake names and fake paperwork to back it all up, and groomed and brainwashed into the perfect agent. These broken husks of young men and women continue a cycle of abuse that creates a steady flow of loyal CIA pawns that at a moment's notice can be made to cease to exist. The same thing happens in the cartels and terror outfits the CIA runs. The same thing happens in the businesses they use as fronts. The same thing happens in the newsrooms they control.

            Where did all this pedophilia come from? Our nation was built on the Roman model, and countless Roman leaders had a boy or two that they kept hidden away. It's not what made Rome spin or anything, but it's certainly what their elite did for fun. That twisted tradition was carried to England, where I'm sure the royalty and the old aristocracy in their castles keep people like livestock to this very day. But here in the states, the Deep State is infatuated with it. Drug and human trafficking is more than a side endeavor for them. It's how they run the country.

            Read the thread under my pinned tweet and you'll come across a tweet with some of the NGO's and charites involved in preying on the slums of Uganda for organ harvesting and paedophilia.
           </p>
           <p>
            What CNN are doing is replacing it's viewers memories with an alternate reality that brings them to a different view of Uganda. They are basically trying to keep this flow of orphans-to-organs "traffic" moving along.

            CNN is controlled media, don't forget that. So this is what's called in the PR world "getting ahead of it." It's the Deep State softening the blow so that people are somewhat conditioned to the idea of human trafficking involving white Americans (read: upstanding community members). Look for more conditioning and if the dam doesn't break but rather leaks, look for PG news to break in chunks, with each one "softened" ahead of time.

            This is not a time for us to kick back and celebrate. We've got the ball and need to make the last drive into the red zone before the two-minute warning. We need to take the ball home.

            not 'like Pizzagate' but 'is Pizzagate'. Pizzagate is not about a Pizza place in DC, it is about global human trafficking enabled by the Clintons and political elite.

             I agree. They are being proactive and trying to circumvent what and who is exposed. Usually whoever confesses first is believed. Like when you make a mistake at work if you admit it first they are likely to be more understanding, but if you wait until you get caught it's a different reaction.

             My prediction - they will virtue signal that they have uncovered a human trafficking ring without expanding the story to include Haiti or the Clintons. A bit like reporting on Weinstein (late) but not going after anybody else because Weinstein was 'the story' as opposed to 'the tip of the iceberg'
