            Seth Rich wasn't being made "an example". The stuff Podesta is talking about are just annoyances they are dealing with and firing someone on the mere suspicion that someone leaked little details in the run-up to the Hillary campaign. If Rich was murdered by the Democrats, it was because his continued living would have been a huge problem. The theory and perhaps evidence that Rich leaked the DNC emails would have been a disaster because the Russian excuse was already underway. Other parts of the timeline would imply that if Rich did leak, lots of people became aware about it before the hit. A hit on Rich at that point could have also come by way of Russia as reverse psychology hit.

            Refusing to let the FBI check their computers and hand picking some shill outfit to do the investigation, and then leaking the results to Reuters day after day would imply that the US media wouldn't touch it because they knew the thing could explode and their fingerprints would be on the cover-up.
