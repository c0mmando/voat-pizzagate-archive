<p>Facebook sent a doctor on a secret mission to ask hospitals to share patient data</p>
<ul>
<li>Facebook was in talks with top hospitals and other medical groups as recently as last month about a proposal to share data about the social networks of their most vulnerable patients.</li>
<li>The idea was to build profiles of people that included their medical conditions, information that health systems have, as well as social and economic factors gleaned from Facebook.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>What a brilliant idea? What could go wrong? </p>
<p>More:&gt;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>But as recently as last month, the company was talking to several health organizations, including Stanford Medical School and American College of Cardiology, about signing the data-sharing agreement.</p>
<p>While the data shared would obscure personally identifiable information, such as the patient\'s name, Facebook proposed using a common computer science technique called &quot;hashing&quot; to match individuals who existed in both sets. Facebook says the data would have been used only for research conducted by the medical community</p>
<p>Facebook\'s pitch, according to two people who heard it and one who is familiar with the project, was to combine what a health system knows about its patients (such as: person has heart disease, is age 50, takes 2 medications and made 3 trips to the hospital this year) with what Facebook knows (such as: user is age 50, married with 3 kids, English isn\'t a primary language, actively engages with the community by sending a lot of messages).</p>
<p>The project would then figure out if this combined information could improve patient care, initially with a focus on cardiovascular health. For instance, if Facebook could determine that an elderly patient doesn\'t have many nearby close friends or much community support, the health system might decide to send over a nurse to check in after a major surgery.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The person in charge of this? &gt;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The exploratory effort to share medical-related data was led by an interventional cardiologist called Freddy Abnousi, who describes his role on LinkedIn as &quot;leading top-secret projects.&quot; It was under the purview of Regina Dugan, the head of Facebook\'s &quot;Building 8&quot; experiment projects group, before she left in October 2017.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In case you missed it:</p>
<h1>FREDDY ABNOUSI</h1>
<p>And here comes the tie in with Soros. </p>

<p>What follows is the bio of Celina Yong, a member of the Paul &amp; Daisy Soros Fellowship for New Americans. But look at this:</p>
<blockquote>
<h1>Celina is married to Freddy Abnousi. Celina and Freddy founded a medical device company called Sense Therapeutics, with the goal of creating cost-effective devices for critical medical needs.</h1>

            An easy route to find the next "Caris James"  If they know everyone's medical, you can't escape ill intentions these companies have in mind. Quite sickening.

             Very true. Users are posting pics of newborns all the time.

             To normal people, they're just babies. But to the sickos? Potential victims.

            Yet again, 100% of the posts in this thread are from women and they are completely clueless:

             WTH is Zuckerface? It seems that this was part of an agenda. Perhaps the stealing of the program was because he saw it as the vehicle to put in place all these other add-ons. Zucker has got to be a puppet carrying out a Soros' global agenda. Nothing else makes any sense.
            </p>
           </blockquote>
           <p>
            "Zuckerface" is a JEW.  SOROS is a JEW.  Google, YouTube, and Facebook are the world's top three most used websites and they're ALL run by JEWS.
           </p>
           <p>
            The term "globalist" was recently deemed an anti-JEWISH slur by a JEWISH advocacy group

            congratulations, you women are more hesitant to Name the guilty party than actual the guilty party itself.  LMAO HOLY SHIT that is embarrassing.

             So many of my friends on FB have talked about operations, etc. It seemed so innocent. Meanwhile, Zuckerface is collecting and documenting it?

              people use the 'check in' feature at that particular doctors office/hospital too, making it all the more easier for Fuckerberg to stalk em.

               Hey, thanks! Always appreciate the support.
              </p>

               There also those online appt setters. Wonder if those were being "secretly" contacted.

                I'm sure its a simple case of hacking. Also those "data privacy breached" issues that pop up every so often (one happened with Experian a few months back) are so telling....

             They were all set up to become Organ Central. It's why this had to always have been part of their agenda. The Cannibal Elite thinks years ... decades in advance and FB was the vehicle. It's why Zuckerface stole it. He got the implications.

            If this isn’t already CREZY ILLEGAL then it should be. I wonder if Facebook ever disclosed this to users??? If it was even mentioned in privacy and/or user agreement?

            Frightening yes but I don't think they have gotten too far yet. Most hospital departments don't share individual's data with each other much less a huge database. How many times have you gone to see a  specialist doctor that is in the same medical system as your primary care physician? Do they ask for the same information that is "supposedly" on record (via computer)? Your list of meds "should" be on file in the "master" system but they want the list from you again. Most of them can't even keep a list of what they prescribed much less another provider. Soros and his cronies will be defeated because none of us will go gentle into that good night without a good fight.

             That’s not the case in the U.K.  all patient medical records  data has been shared with all agencies for some time now.  There was an opt out option but not very well publicised.  Banking, employment driving licence (and driving record) as well as vehicle ownership and social welfare statuses are also stored in a shared system.  There will no doubt be more, I’m sure.

             Shouldn't your name be Gaslight? Seems you're trying awfully hard to normalize this.

            <p>
             Of couse, there was no huge database. This was in the planning stages. The scandal with Cambridge Analytics stopped the implementation of it. Here's the quote:
            </p>
            <blockquote>
             <p>
              The proposal never went past the planning phases and has been put on pause after the Cambridge Analytica data leak scandal raised public concerns over how Facebook and others collect and use detailed information about Facebook users.
             </p>
             <p>
              "This work has not progressed past the planning phase, and we have not received, shared, or analyzed anyone's data," a Facebook spokesperson told CNBC.
             </p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>
             Further, the medical communities were not rejecting the idea. They were in talks with FB as late as last month. Why would they even be talking about it? But here's the quote: &gt;
            </p>
            <blockquote>
             <p>
              But as recently as last month, the company was talking to several health organizations, including Stanford Medical School and American College of Cardiology, about signing the data-sharing agreement.
             </p>
             <p>
              While the data shared would obscure personally identifiable information, such as the patient's name, Facebook proposed using a common computer science technique called "hashing" to match individuals who existed in both sets. Facebook says the data would have been used only for research conducted by the medical community
             </p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>
             Of course, they say it's only going to be used for research conducted by the medical community, but then when are they going through FB? FB is going to be the gatekeeper of this info? Why? And they contradict themselves on what they were going to do in the next quote about matching user data to alert hospitals.
            </p>
            <blockquote>
             <p>
              How many times have you gone to see a specialist doctor that is in the same medical system as your primary care physician? Do they ask for the same information that is "supposedly" on record (via computer)? Your list of meds "should" be on file in the "master" system but they want the list from you again. Most of them can't even keep a list of what they prescribed much less another provider.
             </p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>
             This is entirely not on topic. The question is should Facebook, a private corporation, have your medical information on file and be using it to cross-reference your posts so it can alert the hospitals. The direct quote:
            </p>
            <blockquote>
             <p>
              “Facebook was intending to match it up with user data it had collected, and help the hospitals figure out which patients might need special care or treatment”
             </p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>
             I'm always suspicious when someone replies off topic. I'm even more suspicious when they normalize a Big Brother broach of private information.
            </p>
            <p>
             This is NOT normal. What your doctor does or doen't do in an initial examination is not pertinent. This is a social media company. SOCIAL MEDIA ... not INTRUSIVE MEDICAL.

             Yeah that may sound nicely nice on the surface, but even if it's true do we really need Facebook (and hospitals) treating us like we are little children? If I as an adult need care, I will seek it out myself! I don't need to be monitored and told what to do for my health! This is just another Intrusion into our lives. Their goal is ultimate control of us all

             WTH is Zuckerface? It seems that this was part of an agenda. Perhaps the stealing of the program was because he saw it as the vehicle to put in place all these other add-ons. Zucker has got to be a puppet carrying out a Soros' global agenda. Nothing else makes any sense.

               This means the fix was in from the beginning! I already posted about Kozinski and how the outing of his inappropriate sexual activity was revenge for Kosinzki slamming Kamaltoe Harris!

                Prominent appeals court Judge Alex Kozinski accused of sexual misconduct
               </p>
               <p>
                former clerk for Judge Alex Kozinski said the powerful and well-known jurist, who for many years served as chief judge on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit, called her into his office several times and pulled up pornography on his computer, asking if she thought it was photoshopped or if it aroused her sexually.

               He's on the infamous 9th circuit court.

               <p>
                They argued that Facebook had deceived them about the original value of the settlement, and the court roundly rejected their claims. Yet the sharply worded decision, written by Alex Kozinski, the chief judge of the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, apparently, has not persuaded the twins to give up. They said through their lawyers that they planned to ask that their case be heard by the entire appeals court.
               </p>
               <p>
                Judge Kozinski wrote: “The Winklevosses are not the first parties bested by a competitor who then seek to gain through litigation what they were unable to achieve in the marketplace. With the help of a team of lawyers and a financial adviser, they made a deal that appears quite favorable in light of recent market activity.”
               </p>
               <p>
                Judge Kozinski added: “For whatever reason, they now want to back out. Like the district court, we see no basis for allowing them to do so. At some point, litigation must come to an end. That point has now been reached.”

               I’ve thought about that.  I’m inclined to think it turned into a monster but I think he had ‘help’ to make it so.  I think the potential was spotted and exploited.  I also wonder then how much say Fuckerberg has really had in all of it or if he’s had no choice?

                Somebody needs to look up that case. Find out who the judge was, etc. Have a feeling that he was on the lookout for this kind of idea. It was never social media he was after. He was after social media because people chat and say too much.

              Definitely.  I’ve just opened a random FB page and posted the hell out of it with caps and exclamations (even more than a Carm at her most excited!). I’ve begged everyone to get the hell out - now!  Have to say, there’s always been something about Fuckerberg that’s creeped me.  His sterile stare, obvious lack of proper social skills and overly stretched smooth skin reminds me of that android who got SA citizenship.  He’s like a robot.  (And that wouldn’t surprise me either!). Was talking about this harvesting stuff last night and a friend tells me that a dating site here called ‘Grinder’ has also sold in data but included those who had disclosed their HIV status and they’re now being bombarded with calls from ‘specialist insurers’.  It’s getting out of control - very fast.

               People are just too trusting. They always think that because THEY wouldn't do something like that... Narcissists just love sucking up data on people to use latter against them.

               And think about on FB. People DM and exchange the most personal information. Guess who has all that? It even came out that -- for SOME reason --- FB keeps personal video that the poster has deleted. It makes no sense. Why would they keep personal videos?

               This guy is a monster. Hope his company is dissolved into ruin. He's not normal. He's a plant. He was meant to create this globalization data mining company all along. The social media is just a cover.

                 Absolutely.
                </p>
                <p>
                 There was always an agenda. It was the Trojan horse.
                </p>
                <p>
                 I worked for a high level ad agency in the past and, not surprisingly, they used to have test groups give their opinions on products. It was valuable feedback, but a psychologist figured out that random strangers selected to be in a group didn't necessarily equate with honest answers. But that if that group of people was comprised of FRIENDS, the dynamic changed. When friends talked, the truth came out and all those things we suppress when in the company of strangers were verbalized because of the flow. Suddenly, the exchange became more profoundly meaningful and everything the select group thought was verbalized.
                </p>
                <p>
                 This has to be what FB is based on. By having multiple social groups exchanging information on everything to personal matters to politicals, we're baring our souls and making ourselves vulnerable to the ultimate predator.

            Sense Therapeutics
           </p>
           <p>
            Sensory integration is therapeutic approach that addresses imbalances in how we receive and process sensory information from our bodies and the environment. Sensory integration was initially developed in the late 60s and 70s by Jean Ayres, an occupational therapist and psychologist who mainly worked with children who had sensory and developmental difficulties.
           </p>
           <p>
            Many adults suffer from sensory imbalances too, however, this is rarely addressed in therapy due to the initial focus for research by Jane Ayres being centered around treatment of children. Our fast-paced, competitive and chaotic society has created the perfect recipe for sensory overload, making it difficult for adults and children alike to move through daily life with ease.  For this reason, I have developed a unique approach in working with adults who have sensory imbalances.
           </p>
           <p>
            Sensory integration imbalances arise from the 8 senses, 5 of which we are fairly familiar with -- sight, hearing, smell, touch and taste. The other 3 are proprioception, vestibular and interoception, these are defined below.
           </p>
           <p>
            Proprioception:  Ones sense of self and movement, including body position, strength being employed in movement and kinesthetic perception.
           </p>
           <p>
            Vestibular: Ones sense of balance and spatial orientation.
           </p>
           <p>
            Interoception: This sense is how our body tells our brain what is going on inside our body. For example, the sensations of being hungry, having butterflies in your stomach and your heart beating fast.  This awareness is intimately linked to self-identity, the sense of being "me"

             Hell, yes, it's scaring me! This is a reveal of part of the plan for everything being integrated in a way where there's a net thrown over us. They could harvest, cull, decide who was being irrational through social media posts. Example: Jane Doe vents on FB. Zucker's monitors decide that this is abnormal behavior. They call Hospital B and talk to the physician in charge and tell them about Jane Doe's irrational behavior and suggest modifications added to her list of prescription drugs to keep her calmer. Physician agrees and changes prescription to help Jane Doe calm down.
            </p>
            <p>
             There's so many things wrong with this scenario that I can't properly enumerate them all. FB is social media. So the overview is: A SOCIAL MEDIA COMPANY IS HARVESTING AND SHARING YOUR PERSONAL MEDICAL INFORMATION AND TYING THEM INTO YOUR POSTS!

             <p>
              Just because the doctor prescribes it doesn't mean you have to listen to him. NEVER accept a prescription without doing your own research about it and how it might interact with other prescriptions. Do not blindly rely on medical staff. They fuck up every day.

               You would be surprised at how trusting people are of their doctors. It's ridiculous. This co-worker had shoulder pain so she went to her orthopaedic surgeon who recommended a shoulder replacement. Even though, she expressly didn't want one, she went along. I told her to get a second opinion, but she went right ahead and did what the doctor said.

               This would be another nail in the coffin. People post pics of their kids all the time. This is just scary. Very Big Brother. Hope that interview they're having with Zuckerface contains questions about this. How is it legal for hospitals to be sharing patient information with private corporations? Is it buried in that "sharing information" page they have you sign? The doctors/hospitals say it's for other doctors and other clinics associated with the hospital to share, but is there a clause that would make it legal for them to do this? Are we giving them permission?

                 Yes. Very possibly, but I just took a walk and when the oxygen hit my brain I think I figured out how they could do it.

                <p>
                 The article said the info would be given quote ANONYMOUSLY unquote and that FB would match the info to the user. I'll bet anything there's a clause or caveat that states they can sell or share info if it's done anonymously. But in this case, they're giving it to FB that could identify the patient. But giving it anonymously would be skirting the law and keep it legal.

                 Well, they said it was in the planning phase. Doesn't mean they're not lying and that things were signed, but if it's the truth, they probably don't have anything signed. But it should be illegal to even discuss this. I wonder if that Freddy Abnousi involved made a difference?
