<p>Bondi urges victims to tell their stories as state investigates sexual abuse by priests </p>
<p>Attorney General Pam Bondi has launched a tip site that is part of a statewide investigation of past sex abuse by Catholic priests, she announced Thursday.</p>
<p>Bondi said she’s taking any and all stories about sexual abuse at the website — even if the incidents happened decades ago.</p>
<p>This new way to report clerical abuse was sparked when a Pennsylvania grand jury found that more than 1,000 children had been abused by 301 priests over a 70-year-period, while the higher authorities in the church covered it up, Bondi said.</p>

<p>“When (news about) the case aired, I could not sleep that night,” Bondi said, explaining the number of cases is likely to be higher in Florida because it’s a bigger state than Pennsylvania.</p>
<p>A Boca Raton priest who assisted at Ascension Catholic Church between 2007 and 2011 is among the 301 Pennsylvania priests accused in that investigation. Monsignor Thomas Benestad used holy water to rinse out the boy\'s mouth after having him perform oral sex on the priest, the report said.</p>

<p>The Archdiocese of Miami issued a statement in reaction to Bondi’s Thursday news conference applauding the investigation and pledging the cooperation it’s been extending to law enforcement officials for the past 16 years.</p>
<p>The archdiocese has its own hotline for any complaints, and has established safe environment” policies in keeping with a “zero tolerance” policy for such abuse, the archdiocese’s state said.</p>
<p>“When an allegation of sexual abuse of a child or a vulnerable adult by a member of the clergy or church personnel is received, it is immediately reported to the appropriate county state attorney’s office,” the statement from the archdiocese’s spokeswoman said.</p>
<p>The Diocese of Palm Beach did not issue a formal statement regarding Bondi’s announcement. One of its priests, in 2017, filed a libel suit against the diocese for retaliating against him for going to authorities about a sexual abuse case.</p>
<p>The Rev. John Gallagher said the diocese had branded him a liar for his role in the case involving a visiting priest who showed a teenager pornographic material. As a result, he could not find another flock to lead, according to his claim.</p>
<p>The case was dismissed in May.</p>
<p>The Rev. Jose Palimatttom, a visiting priest at Holy Name of Jesus Catholic Church in West Palm Beach, pled guilty to showing obscene material to a minor in 2015. He served six months in jail and was deported back to India.</p>
<p>Bondi said she was not necessarily looking for the Catholic church’s misdeeds, but all institutional abuses. Still, after the Pennsylvania news came out, she said that more than 15 people have come forward with stories about what happened to them in a similar setting, in Florida.</p>
<p>“Even if you live in another state now, even if years have passed, we want to hear from you,” she said.</p>

              I remember that during Trump’s presidential campaign he thought he would bring Bondi onboard, and I immediately thought, “would you look at that, bringing that corrupt bitch onboard and they are two peas in a pod” because MSM repeatedly said Trump University, which did a bait and switch too. This was the main reason I did not vote for Trump. I am putting the cart before the horse, so I will dive in on Bondi now.
             </p>
             <p>
              I got partially scammed by a school in Florida. Partially meaning they got some of the student loan money. A person who was about to graduate found out they were doing a bait and switch on the certification, so I dropped out, halfway through the course. Not only that, but another student was bragging about lying to get unemployment, which in this course, we were taught not to look the other way when fraud is discovered in our future careers.
             </p>
             <p>
              I sent a letter with all the evidence I collected of the school bait and switch and how the school was turning a blind eye to the student’s fraud. Months went by before and Bondi contacted me and said, there was not enough evidence to go forward with case.
             </p>
             <p>
              Then I was really pissed when Betsy Devos was confirmed because she stonewalled the whole hearing but not answering questions about anything. this is basically a job interview, but as usual the crooked government confirmed her. Then she repealed Obozo student protections against for-profit schools to make a claim to ask the student loan be forgiven due to schiesty scams like bait and switch.
             </p>
             <p>
              This was before Q came along and the reason Trump knows the the family is because Eric Prince is her brother, and he handles Trump’s security detail and their are billionaires because they are the ones who invented the lighted mirror that are on sun visors in vehicles.

               What a disgusting turn of events.  I can't stand Devos myself and have long know about Prince and his Blackwater co.  So this is a fine mess we have here.  I really don't trust any of the AGs really, they will have to prove themselves to me.  I know a Victim and she said Shapiro of Pen. was to be trusted and he did good.  But that was a blessing.  So far we have outed Kamala Harris, Karl Racine and Lisa Murray Madigan.  Madigan was adopted at the age of 20 and her real father was a Mafioso from Jersey and is now dead.  We are not on good footing so far.   Thank you for your candid report.

The comment was deleted but in a nutshell she provided info about Bondi and that she is not a good person, she thought she was good and that she said she was involved in a school that was bilking it's students and when she contacted her, she pretty much left her high and dry and refused to help under the guise that it did not apply.  She said she found out she is not who she claims to be.  Not a good report imo.  She deleted her comment because if tended to dox her. I was pretty tired last night when I read it and now am a little fuzzy on what she said, but it did not bode well for Bondi.  I am afraid she will put a spell on this sex abuse report and be easily swayed by the Church.

               BTW, I try not to mention Pence in public circles since I'm not certain.
              </p>
              <p>
               If he is clean and not who Timothy Homselth and some other think he is, I don't want to mar what is there for President Trump.
              </p>
              <p>
               I don't believe Trump is aware.
              </p>
              <p>
               The other take is, if Pence is dirty, I believe Trump was forced to take him in order to run.
              </p>
              <p>
               I usually just talk about Pence with people I trust and tell them I'm not sure and I hope the speculation is wrong.  I really want it to be wrong.

               Far more to this.  Hoping to do a steemit article on it soon as there is so much involved.

               Did you see the Timothy Holmseth info?  I couldn't believe it.  Very hard for me.
              </p>
              <p>
               I'm familiar with some of the departments he spoke about being involved in trafficking.
              </p>
              <p>
               I keep praying he is off base with his connections of Pence being involved.  If Pence looked the other way, and was involved in other activities like knowledge of the Blue House, pretty horrible.  Hard to rectify.  I always hope Pence isn't there as a Deep Stater ready to take Trump's place for them.
              </p>
              <p>
               His daughter got married at what appears to be a Scottish Rite Temple, so that isn't a good sign.
              </p>
              <p>
               I know people can say they believe in God and talk about God and be lying to your face.  I hope Holmseth has that part wrong.
              </p>
              <p>
               Pence good friends with Bondi and many feel there is a trafficking route there in FL and Pence helped feed it.
              </p>
              <p>
               Sorry for rambling.  Still hard for me to deal with Pence.  I really feel I'm on the fence with him.  I go back and forth.

                Well, I sure can understand why you would be on the fence.  We have been lied to so often by so many when we hear things like this, we don't know what to think.  I think it's important to put this out there just for research sake.  We need to get at it and possibly do some really deep investigating into Pence and Bondi.  I am hoping not to find anything nefarious, but we really do need to know.  God this was a shock.

                 I had done a lot of research into Epstein, so we all know horrible things go on there in Florida due to their location.
                </p>
                <p>
                 Even doctors giving papers to have kids flown all over internationally by citing medical conditions among other diagnosis.
                </p>
                <p>
                 What these wicked people do is nothing short of horrible.  The problem on some of these boards is people say it's old news.
                </p>
                <p>
                 It happened years ago, but has never been dealt with fully, so these same types of people continue to get back with their evil abuses and torture of these children.

                  I am now worried about what kind of investigation she is going to run.  Benestad is a violent rapist and he has been known to visit gay bars  That was posted by someone in a post I did on StcharlesSeminary.  He committed satanic ritual abuse on her and the little boy he made drink holy water.  I hope she is not going to give him a pass.  She had better wise up.
