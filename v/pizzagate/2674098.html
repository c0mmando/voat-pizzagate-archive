<p>&quot;I can\'t believe it\'s come to this. I\'m as grieved and hurt as I possibly could be,&quot; Moore, a former president of the Tracy Police Officers Association, said moments before her plea. &quot;It\'s beyond words to describe the depth of sorrow I have for the department I love and the city I grew up in ... that it has gone to this level.&quot;</p>
<p>Moore, a former athlete who was diagnosed with the eating disorder anorexia nervosa, said she suffered a lower-back injury in January 2002 when she jumped on a suspect while in pursuit. She re-injured the area more than a year later while restraining a suspect.</p>
<p>According to her lawyer, Lawrence Bohm of Sacramento, a magnetic resonance imaging screen, performed after the second incident, showed degeneration in three lumbar vertebrae. Moore underwent disc-replacement surgery at the University of California, San Francisco, on Oct. 12, 2004.</p>
<p>&quot;They believe Jenny is lying about the extent of her pain. They\'re claiming she allowed doctors to cut a 6-inch gash in her abdomen and insert metal disks in her spine for financial gain,&quot; Bohm said.</p>
<p>Deputy District Attorney Eual Blansett Jr. filed the charges Jan. 21, although an arrest warrant wasn\'t issued.</p>
<p>Blansett said 11 of the 12 counts Moore faces stem from withholding information or making false statements to her physicians, Dr. Anh Lee and Dr. Randall Armstrong.</p>
<p>&quot;It doesn\'t make a difference if you tell one doctor the truth; you\'re supposed to tell everyone the truth all the way through the process,&quot; Blansett said.</p>
<p>In August, Moore filed a civil complaint against the city of Tracy for defamation, fraud, disability harassment and violating the Police Officer Procedural Bill of Rights. In a letter dated July 29, Bohm wrote then-City Manager Fred Diaz that Moore was unfairly placed on unpaid administrative leave and had her workers\' compensation benefits terminated</p>
<p>About the same time, Bohm wrote, the city stopped paying her insurance premiums and launched an internal investigation into Moore\'s conduct after the second back injury.</p>
<p>Moore\'s civil complaint was rejected by the City Council in December.</p>
<p>&quot;It is interesting to note that no charges were filed until we pursued the civil case against the city of Tracy,&quot; Bohm said.</p>
<p>Tracy City Attorney Debra Corbett said she couldn\'t comment on the criminal charges against Moore because it\'s a county issue.</p>

            Obviously the charges were retaliation to try and harass her for her whistleblowing. Standard protocol. That's what always happens to TIs.

            It seems in this evil day and age that there might be paid killers that say get a percentage of what your payout would be to silence you...I mean stranger things are happening in this world. People EATING CHILDREN post abusing them. Why not a little wet works rewarding with a bird dog of your settlement. Not saying this did happen but hey...it could be.

              I feel bad because I just read a text where she said something about him having her back and it made me kind of sad how women especially will not see things in their desire to be needed protected and a part of a team group or family. We are all guilty of it but women being mothers I think do this to a larger degree. Peace JEM I hope that if it was something nefarious that you will have justice.

              It isn't suspicious if you look at a map. Tracy CA is located in a triangle of 3 major highways. There is a Seattle suburb (Renton) whose slogan is "ahead of the curve" because it is located before the s-curves on the 405. It's normal.

               Most of us on here get roped into doing other stuff.  lol.  We are just that way.  There is something so very wrong, I will say it again.  So the post you did with that article about her back.  What does that mean?  I am so confused now.   Could it be any more confusing?

                just trying to find what I can, backtracking
               </p>
               <p>
                Is she dead, I dont know, I dont even know if Seth Rich is dead
               </p>
               <p>
                I just seem to be questioning a lot that pops up
               </p>
               <p>
                I researching to help me see bigger picture
               </p>
               <p>
                so hard to trust these days what I read
               </p>
               <p>
                makes sense she was in California
               </p>
               <p>
                at sometime she came across info on Obama, and seems to have reached out to victims of abuse and specific Clinton
               </p>
               <p>
                she has been in contact with George Webb for considerable time
               </p>
               <p>
                but only remember vague stuff on him
               </p>
               <p>
                some liked him some didnt
               </p>
               <p>
                I just have a lot of questions and trying to find answers
               </p>
               <p>
                thought others might be looking too, so I share what I find
               </p>
               <p>
                most Jem post have been looked at, so made it a post
               </p>
               <p>
                again, not sure why you are confused
               </p>
               <p>
                it is what it is, confirmation on what she told us
               </p>
               <p>
                I didnt know Jem personally, so I starting where I can and working forward
               </p>
               <p>
                wrote no judgement because I having looked over enough stuff yet
               </p>
               <p>
                Jem had said she was on the run, but hearing she died, well I looking and hoping she not
               </p>
               <p>
                I didnt know WIC a group, thought he some kind of insider
               </p>
               <p>
                I've looked into a lot of WIC stuff and usually hit brick walls, things covered very well
               </p>
               <p>
                the Google, twitter, FB etc stuff he was right on
               </p>
               <p>
                its the same I did with Seth
               </p>
               <p>
                post was not made to be confusing

                 It wasn't anything about your post.  It is the whole thing surrounding her and GW.  She was not that close to him, at least not in my thinking. Yet, there is a picture posted of her with him and he was the one that was the first to announce her death.  He seemed to know so much about her, but I think she spent more time helping Our Children than helping him.  Who would want to kill her - the hanging thread..............

                  I also know a lot of her posts got deleted because it was more for whatever then PG, same when my posts got deleted

                   The George Show started with an article from TP back in 2016 (spring I think) about Eric Braverman which kicked off his first season "Where is Eric Braverman?" The show really didn't gain momentum til pg tho, more accurately voat pg since his videos were shared a lot here. A few months later there was a whole network of personalities and outlets, and Tom Pain and TP of course associated themselves with these new outlets like crowdsource the truth as well as goerge himself.

                       All I know: Lots of things G  and TP hv said (early on at least) I was able to verify, lots and lots was confidential sourced based (like russiagate),  and there has been some lies and redirection. They really haven't been tested by the media either besides the bomb hoax, which his brother wrote a white paper on describing the threat of social media conspiracists to national security. So not saying anything is not real or anything, just I'd like to see any sort of news or report from outside this infoloop that didn't exist a couple of years ago.

                        he didnt get info all the time, thats why he had so many bombs, but he did get them and then he was back up

                       <p>
                        True Pundit is the same as George, either up or washed out
                       </p>
                       <p>
                        what is George relationship with Thomas Paine?
                       </p>
                       <p>
                        a lot to look into and if this  is some spook thing, answers wont be coming from web
                       </p>
                       <p>
                        I watching George on all his media platform
                       </p>
                       <p>
                        he sure does like attention and he does talk alot, maybe find clues there
                       </p>
                       <p>
                        some have said Jenny was with him for a long time
                       </p>
                       <p>
                        is this where she got her info or was George trying to get it from her?
                       </p>

                   What scares me about her being dead is the lawsuit against Bill C.  I too hope she still lives.  But they are Blood Curdling Evil.  I too think there should be looking into Robin and George.  Robin may not be as true blue as she seems or may be ok  and we know George is not.

            But that's not the whole story.  The judge dropped the charges.  Then she sued the DA.  Not sure of the outcome tho.

            Former Tracy police Officer Jenny Moore filed a tort claim with San Joaquin County on Thursday against Deputy District Attorney Eual Blansett Jr. in his attempt to prosecute Moore for workers’ compensation and insurance fraud....
            <strong>
             The charges against Moore were dismissed
            </strong>
            in June, and Superior Court Judge Peter Saiers declared her “factually innocent” of illegally attempting to collect workers’ compensation insurance payments after two lower-back injuries she suffered in the line of duty.

             That would be a good motivator to fully taint ones perspective on the supposedly ‘good guys’ and launch a mission and use her skills to go after corruption. The fact that she went to ICE div to include DHS (as being claimed) a few weeks back, and got no help makes you wonder if the good guys are in control. There’s a cancer that needs to be nuked.

              I agree, she would have an insiders perspective on different levels of LE and how they protect their own, sometimes pander to elite interests etc.  I haven't had a chance to look into her friend Robyn Gritz - FBI agent fired by McCabe.  I bet there's more to this angle of the story in that direction.

                Sounds like a snow job to get rid of her, and if we need to guess her area of interest (we don't, she became close friends with Jem after all) we can see why.  Thanks for the research.

               Robyn is on LinkedIn... 16 @ FBI years is fairly significant experience. That’s going to you some serious training. Perhaps this lady spent some time in Quantico at their center that heads human trafficking.

              Must be 100s of workman’s comps filed by 5-0  everyday in every major city. Even Feds gotta file if a deranged jackass Antifa decides to lodge a canister across lines and does damage. A back surgery even 10 years back is going to be 50 plus grand to include permanent disability... suit should be 800k plus... didint read, but if she finally won a settlement of that magnitude, she could persue FT investigation on her time. How was she earning a living chasing down leads, flying around and interviewing... ?

            How long has Jem been fighting these sick pieces of shit? For all we know this could be a hit piece on her. She was the president of the freaken Tracy Police Officers Association. The fact that she felt like she could trust none of her fellow officers for protection is so sad. Jem should of had Federal and Police protection.
