            I was doing a bit of light research on the Kidguard app - check out the search phrase suggested by Google:
            <a href="https://imgur.com/a/JCSmV7d">

           <p>
            Guess that goes along with this NY Times article:
            <strong>
             Hundreds of Apps Can Empower Stalkers to Track Their Victims
            </strong>

           <blockquote>
            <p>
             <strong>
              KidGuard is a phone app that markets itself as a tool for keeping tabs on children. But it has also promoted its surveillance for other purposes and run blog posts with headlines like “How to Read Deleted Texts on Your Lover’s Phone.”
             </strong>
            </p>
            <p>
             As digital tools that gather cellphone data for tracking children, friends or lost phones have multiplied in recent years, so have the options for people who abuse the technology to track others without consent.
            </p>
            <p>
             More than 200 apps and services offer would-be stalkers a variety of capabilities, from basic location tracking to harvesting texts and even secretly recording video, according to a new academic study.
            </p>
            <p>
             But data breaches at two surveillance companies last year — revealing accounts of more than 100,000 users, according to the technology site
             <strong>
              Motherboard
             </strong>
             — gave some sense of the scale. The tracking app company mSpy told The New York Times that it sold subscriptions to more than 27,000 users in the United States in the first quarter of this year.

            I haven't read the whole article yet but  apparently they've done a whole series of articles on tracker software.  I'm wondering exactly who it is they are trying to educate.

             Your right on target IMO . I’ve been researching them too since this post . I’ve also been researching the comments that were removed from Notinmyworld website  like this one 
“ how did you like how I told the story, how we had to sacrifice somebody? “ and look ..https://imgur.com/a/sz1N6Sp
This comment was in fact on that website but it was removed or hidden ? It shows up in the search results as coming from “ Notinmyworld” I want

Also this ( stared sourly at the corpse of the young blonde woman. Her tongue looking like grape flavored bubble gum stuffed in her mouth. Her eyes had rolled back in her head. )

                You had to have been there, LOL.  Here's a wordpress website that was set up around the Hampstead case - different scenario (on the surface), similar vibe. Check out the comments section on the blogs.  Look at the way they interact with each other.  In the UK, we call it 'pissing around'.

               To be clear , I’m not saying HB is connected to this organization , but it was her retweet of AOH that landed us here . She most likely didn’t know ( at least that’s what I hope for) but now that it’s been brought to our attention , we can’t just ignore it .

            , well done for your mini battle with this lot.  Your thread has been deleted despite the obvious need for further research by this community.  But many have seen that.  Your post served it purpose and this is another example where TPTB re this forum, have shot themselves in the foot.  This post certainly drew my attention to a few more pieces of the puzzle.  Thank you.

             I have gathered more info and will put up another post tomorrow.  Yes, I could have set put the facts better but I was in a hurry.  However it's now clear to me what's going on here at Voat and it saddens me.  I want to thank you and others like.

             who saw the post for what it was--- an honest statement of shock that some of us are now colluding with child traffickers while taking money from innocent people who believe they're donating to a worthy cause.

              Good ! I can’t wait to see it . If what’s happening here on voat is what we think it is , then it’s very sad. I’ve been scolded here too before .  Having all those mods and then the owner mod chime in really gave me a whole different feel here .  I’ve been saying this since 2016 they have “ compartmentalized “ us all !

              . I don't follow HB on Twitter so I wasn't aware of this Ark of Hope for Children thing.  I was stunned by the obvious fakery and also, tongue-in-cheek satire, of the whole cheap and shoddy setup while so-called well known figures of the alt truth community (all who were previously on my own personal list of probable intelligence assets) were supporting the whole sorry outfit. It's really striking how dumbed down people are. And it's no wonder that articles are beginning to appear in the MSM about the 'moral panic' of the alt right.  That was clearly the next step in the script and it's these types of shite operations that were put in place for that.

              Luciferians delight in that type of trickery. However, the 'duper's delight' is quite evident in the

            , I will remove the post now per mods' comments, since it wasn't edited. My suggestion would be to look into 'notinmyworld', you could try to find old versions of their website using the wayback machine at archive.org. Please note that when doing a post abou them you would have to back up comment quotes with working links that show the comment (like an archive would).

             In fact, it was edited. I was asked to prove that honeybee had retweeted arkofhope, and I added a screenshot. I was also asked to provide evidence that aoh was in league with Tracy beanz and hagmann report and I added a screen shot of that.  What you're doing is sad.

              While I agree that it is weird that they call the 'notinmyworld' guys affiliates, and the AoH charity
              <em>
               might
              </em>
              be shady, we need some
              <em>
               evidence
              </em>
              that they are pedos. This has already been pointed out before, see also the lengthy comment I wrote yesterday, and also
              <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/user/Crensch">

              As I said, it's totally fine to look into these two organizsations, but we'd need
              <strong>
               proof
              </strong>
              . This is why I suggested to do a new post, focusing on notinmyworld.

            I see where Notinmyworld links to AoH, but not the other way around.

            The rest of your post is about Notinmyworld, not AoH, which is the focus of all of this.  You have a one-way link here so far, from what I've seen.

            Here is the OP's original post about Ark of Hope. It's 1.4 years old and nobody had a problem with him having a problem with them back then.

            He even applauded the Honeybee in the top of his post. So his question here in this post makes sense, why are they associating themselves?

            I don't think anyone here is an authority on all organizations by any means but it's not like he is just pulling this one out of thin air, he's had concerns for 1.4 years.

             Last week, I was surprised to see I’d been nominated by Amanda over at ARomerTherapy for the Sisterhood of the World Bloggers Award. I have to admit, I’d never heard of it before and had to rely on good old Google to see what it was all about. The award is based on peer nominations and recognises women within the travel blogging community. It’s a way of engaging with other bloggers and for our readers to find out more about us! I’m flattered to be chosen; it’s great to hear that people are enjoying reading my posts

            "Darkness to Light" was coincidentally the name of a Childhood Sexual Abuse training I went through recently that was being offered by CPS or some affiliated agency. After I was harassed for my journalism and someone reported me to CPS for "exposing my children to the dangers of journalism," CPS sided with me and referred me to it. Didn't know it was affiliated with the Bidens, that's pretty obvious for pedo affiliation. The presenter actually slipped up and used the term "little friend" which is another pedo code word. THESE PEOPLE ARE SICK.

            After having been banned by the courts of Assen (The Netherlands) in July 2012, the appeals court has now decided to lift the ban against Martijn.
The Dutch government has removed their ban of an organization called MARTIJN that fights for their “right” to have sex with children of any age.” For years they, along with groups such as NAMBLA and PNVD have sought to normalize sexual attraction to young boys and girls internationally. Victimization of very young to teen boys and girls is happening behind closed doors around the world, all over the social networks and in your community. Whether as blatant as child trafficking, by a teacher at your child’s grade school or by a well hidden neighbor down the street, it is happening near you.
           </p>
           <p>
            The cancer of child victimization is growing and we have become too desensitized to it. I help survivors of all forms of child abuse on a daily basis. Whether abused physically or sexually by a “close friend of the family” or having “survived” the most abhorred and ignored varieties like institutional abuse, the lifelong damage can be so severe that we simply cannot turn a blind eye any longer.
           </p>
           <p>
            Martijn is an association known for their glorification of sexual relationships between children and adults. Martijn advocates that “erotic contacts between adults and children of any age, that are pleasurable and consensual, should be accepted by society.” After having been banned by the courts of Assen (The Netherlands) in July 2012, the appeals court has now decided to lift the ban against Martijn.
           </p>
           <p>
            Ring The Alarm is calling on the Dutch government for the re-banning of Martijn. It seeks legislation to prevent child sex advocacy activities by Martijn or other organizations from victimizing children by violating Article 34 of the United Nation Convention on the Rights of the Child (UNCRC) and more. Ark of Hope for Children is helping raise the voices of APLE Cambodia and OBB South Africa and ask you to join us.

             Bruce D. Perry is an American psychiatrist, currently the Senior Fellow of the Child Trauma Academy in Houston, Texas and an Adjunct Professor of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences at the Feinberg School of Medicine in Chicago, Illinois.
            </p>
            <p>
             Bruce Perry was born in 1955 in Bismarck, ND, the second of four children. His father, Duncan Richard Perry, was a dentist and his mother, Donna (Henry) Perry, a homemaker. Perry attended Amherst College in Amherst, Massachusetts but didn't graduate.[1] He took classes that interested him but did not fulfill requirements for a bachelor's degree.[2] Even without a bachelor's degree,[3] he earned a M.D. and Ph.D. at Northwestern University. He completed a residency, from 1984 through 1987, in psychiatry at Yale University School of Medicine. In 1987, Perry did a fellowship in Child and Adolescent Psychiatry at the University of Chicago.
            </p>
            <p>
             Perry has served as a consultant and expert witness on many high-profile incidents involving traumatized children, including the Columbine High School massacre, the Oklahoma City bombing, the Waco siege, and the YFZ Ranch custody cases.
            </p>
            <p>
             Perry's first wife, Arlis Perry, was murdered in Stanford Memorial Church on the grounds of Stanford University in California on October 12, 1974.

Arlis told her husband she wanted to pray alone inside the church, and they parted.[3] Bruce became concerned when his wife hadn't returned home by 3 a.m. He called the Stanford Police and reported her missing. Officers from the Santa Clara County Sheriff's Office went to the church and reported all the outer doors were locked.

            <p>
             Arlis Perry was brutally slain in Stanford University's church in 1974. This morning, the Santa Clara County Sheriff's Office served a warrant for someone who has been a suspect for a long time. Apparently they had long suspected him, but hadn't had concrete DNA evidence until recently. They knocked on the door and identified themselves, then heard a single gunshot from the other side of the door.
            </p>
            <p>
             UPDATE: The Sheriffs Department is scheduled to make a statement at 5 p.m., but from what we can tell, it looks like the suspect is Stephen Crawford (the security guard who conveniently was also the one to discover Perry's body).

             At least this finally exonerates Dr.Perry. He was so utterly railroaded by the police. That story he told on This American Life about them lying about a witness to try and get him to confess upset me so much.

             Convicted killer David Berkowitz -- more famous as the "Son of Sam" who terrorized New York in 1976 and '77 -- has also professed membership in the Four Pi cult, revealing inside knowledge of a California homicide allegedly committed by the group. In 1979, Berkowitz smuggled a book on witchcraft out of his prison cell, with passages on Manson and the Four Pi movement underlined. One page bore a cryptic notation in the killer's own handwriting : "Arlis Perry. Hunted, stalked, and slain. Followed to California." As researched by Maury Terry, the Berkowitz note points directly to an unsolved murder committed at Stanford University in mid-October 1974.

                I think these fake charities like Ark of Hope and Notinmyworld are putting  out feelers for vulnerable and homeless kids, taking them in and then using them for nefarious purposes.  I'm so disappointed in honeybee.

                 With their 'Christian' emphasis they are also appealing to the alt right side of the political spectrum.  The irony is that one or two degrees of separation away we have the same crowd we are supposedly investigating:  all I found with your thread were dodgy wordpress websites (reminded me so much of the Hampstead case); New Age jargon used by the Tavistock/Harvard lot and their trauma based psychology which is actually mindfucking the public and links back to the Open Society and the UN Agenda 21 via cyber military groups that have been in operation, albeit in other names, since World War II and maybe, earlier.  These social media characters (who still don't realize that the voat crowd is not like the simpleton followers on Twitter) are simply coralling the alt right crowd back into another form of 'social justice', similar to the cult like following of the leftie SJWs. Peace out.

                Yes, I think so.  Not going to spend too much time with this because there's obviously a flown blown psyop going on here for sheeple.  I'm more interested in the meta picture and the top.  They are connected to the the MKUltra, Tavistock programming... Harvard et al...

             The Earth Charter and the Ark of Hope
            </a>
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             In the late 1990's, a document called the "Earth Charter" was drafted by a group of prominent Humanist-Socialists including:
            </p>
            <p>
             Steven Rockefeller, Maurice Strong, Mikhail Gorbachev
            </p>
            <p>
             In place of the simple elegance of the rules for self-government and social stability expressed above, the Earth Charter calls for the imposition of a global tyranny over every aspect of human activity which becomes evident once you strip away the rhetorical devices and eco-socialist jargon.

             The Earth Charter was inscribed on papyrus paper and enshrined in a wooden box called the "Ark of Hope" which was decorated with neo-pagan, politically correct artwork and paraded around the world by a troupe of believers. According to the official description, the carrying poles for the Ark are "unicorn horns" which ward off evil spirits (I'm not making this up, see for yourself).

             , the Earth Charter needs to be looked into. It leads back to the UN Sustainability Agenda, the Lucis Trust and a number of dodgy characters and psyops...eg: the Hampstead case.  (No wonder you're getting such push back, I can't believe the scale of this thing. No time today to explain further about that .) Quick rundown re Hampstead:

The full moon (with the sun in Libra) was late in the evening of Sunday, the final day of the Summit. And it was not just any full moon – popularly called a ‘Supermoon’ the moon was especially close to earth so it appeared much larger in the night sky than usual. And there was a full lunar eclipse producing a red effect on the moon.

              Agree that the Earth Charter should be looked into, but wasn't that a different Ark of Hope? Would be interesting to find out whether they named themselves after the UN Ark of Hope though.

              omg.  thank you.   I had seen (but have been unable to find it again) a comment by Blair Corbett, the founder of Ark of Hope, saying that the authorities had shut him down after they found kids in his basement.

             NGO, and think it's good to looked into them, like we did with so many other anti-child trafficking organizations. It seems that
             <em>
              Ark of Hope
             </em>
             provides info, and offers chat rooms for survivors of abuse. This

              might
             </em>
             be shady, since it offers the opportunity to collect money without in fact doing any real work apart from setting up a website and put some info about sexual abuse on it.

            <p>
             However, I don't see any

              proof
             </strong>
             that they are a pedo group, and while they
             <em>
              might
             </em>
             be a fake charity, this also would need to be proved. It's good to look into them, but more research should be done before before claiming

            <blockquote>

             Re the 'notinmyworld' site: Yesterday they showed a pic of two white rabbits when I accessed the site - this pic is gone now, instead it shows two eagles with a chick. (Strange.)

             Considering they also show an owl on their main page, this organization should be researched.

             Why not wait until Honeybee_  would have replied to Piscina's Twitter message beore doing a post here?

                OMGoodness, has anyone watched this talk for Pro-Paedophiles? Their agenda seems to make us 'normal people' feel bad if we exclude or judge them because they are 'born like that and cannot help it' - so sick of this push to normalise child abuse. They state Paedophilia is NOT the same as Child Abuse? ------- **TED Conference by Mirjam Heine (ff 6:20 mins) The Paedophile Agenda -

                As of January 2018, over 2600 TED talks had been posted.[16] Every week 5-7 new talks are published. In January 2009, the then number of videos had been viewed 50 million times. In June 2011, the number of views totaled 500 million,[56] and on November 13, 2012, TED reached its billionth video view.[18] Chris Anderson in an interview in March 2012:
A snippeT about TED is scary, so far as the amount of people they 'reach' spreading this crap.
                <br/>
                It used to be 800 people getting together once a year; now it's about a million people a day watching TED Talks online. When we first put up a few of the talks as an experiment, we got such impassioned responses that we decided to flip the organization on its head and think of ourselves not so much as a conference but as "ideas worth spreading," building a big website around it. The conference is still the engine, but the website is the amplifier that takes the ideas to the world. - from:

            , this is quite the string of logical leaps you've threaded together here, coincidentally the very same day we are getting hit by an obvious forum sliding attack studded with attacks on other well known Pizzagate names. Let me summarize your "argument":
           </p>
           <p>
            Thesis:
            <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/user/Honeybee_">

            is not to be trusted, the supposed child abuse activist is a pedo enabler.
Evidence: Child abuse activist retweeted a meme urging people to "volunteer" to "help survivors thrive" by an organization that fights child abuse
Claim ("Ark of Hope is a very shady organization that purports to be anti-child-trafficking but in reality does nothing except perhaps signal to other pedos that they are in the same business"): It's a fake organization that caters to pedos. Evidence: No direct evidence given that this organization is not helping kids.
           </p>
           <p>
            This lack of evidence supporting your claim is neatly hidden under a string of side claims beginning with the organization's founder that implies he is not protecting kids ("Ark of Hope is a very shady organisation...Ark of Hope's founder is Blair Corbett...You will see that he has posted an article on a Dutch court legalising a 'child love' (aka pedophilia) group.") without supplying any actual direct links to specific evidence of this, just a general link to his bio. A look
            <a href="https://goodmenproject.com/good-feed-blog/dutch-courts-lift-ban-on-child-love-group/">
             at the article in question
            </a>
            makes it very clear Corbett is raising awareness about government enabled abuse by pedo groups:
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             "The Dutch government has removed their ban of an organization called MARTIJN that fights for their “right” to have sex with children of any age.” For years they, along with groups such as NAMBLA and PNVD have sought to normalize sexual attraction to young boys and girls internationally. Victimization of very young to teen boys and girls is happening behind closed doors around the world, all over the social networks and in your community. Whether as blatant as child trafficking, by a teacher at your child’s grade school or by a well hidden neighbor down the street, it is happening near you. The cancer of child victimization is growing and we have become too desensitized to it. I help survivors of all forms of child abuse on a daily basis."
            </p>
           </blockquote>
           <p>
            The article you linked is actually evidence Ark of Hope/Corbett ARE doing something -- namely informing the public about pro-pedo government policies. Yet you act as if this link -- which you mention but did not provide -- supports your negative you are trying to prove.
           </p>
           <p>
            Next Claim: Ark of Hope guy "affiliated" (whatever that means, you don't say) with another organization you say is doing nothing to fight pedos ("Ark of Hope is affiliated with Robert Strongbow - Notinmyworld
            <a href="https://notinmyworld.org/">

            which calls itself a 'resource centre', although again it does nothing in reality.") Again, you give no evidence they "do nothing in reality." Instead you take us around Robinhood's barn which somehow strings Beau Biden to King Gustav of Sweden.
           </p>
           <p>

             No, I am saying wtf is going on when a charity that has clear links to some Satanism shit is being promoted (and, yes, it's promoted if its retweeted to her 32,000 followers) by her.
            </p>
            <p>
             You can say what you like about me, but anyone who goes back and looks over my threads will see that I have not prevaricated; I have not defended shady organisations; and I don't have a horse in the race.   Perhaps HoneyBee didn't know about AOH dodgy links, but now she does and she's still defending. I don't get it.

               This is a perfect example of the way you interact with people. You attempt to discredit them when they ask a reasonable question. Newsflash:  that makes YOU look bad, not anyone else. Why are you so hateful?  Here you are accusing me of being full of disinfo because I made a mistake.  You should admit you didn't look into Ark of Hope before you retweeted them. Otherwise the simple conclusion to draw is that you did, and you know that they're a BS charity. btw, their financial show that they collected no donations and spent NO money on any charity work.

             Wow, I am a long time poster here.    I point out the following:
            </p>
            <ol>
             <li>
              I never accused HoneyBee of anything; I asked her to explain some issues. I did not draw a conclusion until her reply.
             </li>
             <li>
              <p>
               I am a small nobody on the other side of the world. I am not seeking an audience; I'm not asking for money. I have been here from the get-go for the children, and I think my posts will attest to that.
              </p>
             </li>
             <li>
              <p>
               Despite all your claims, there is not one shred of evidence that points to ArkofHope is a charity.
              </p>
             </li>
             <li>
              <p>
               What happened to all the great detectives we had at the beginning of pizzagate.  Now I see no one doing any critical thinking and a lot of ad hom attacks. What's happening?
              </p>
             </li>
             <li>
              <p>
               As I said, I had the utmost respect for HoneyBee, but I have to say that something is not right. Blind Freddie can see that ArkofHope is a BS charity and that it has links to Satanist BlackHorn33 with his MAKEITULTRA psychologist for vulnerable kids.
              </p>
             </li>
             <li>
              <p>
               Again, reputable charities will ALWAYS provide info on their websites about their outreach work and their objectives.  But there is nothing on AOH or any of its connected 'charities'.

              Nice Alinsky move there. You post an entire thread that is an ad hom attack, one making numerous unsubstantiated claims that totally give the finger to the submission rules and you wonder what is happening. SMH.

            Hey Pisscina, I reported NCMEC to FBI for not showing images of children when they reported them missing and also for blocking citizens, not sure why one day I was unblocked, maybe because I scared them. NCMEC is definitely a clearing house for CP and tracking assets, not sure what Ark of Hopes Connection to them is, just because they have stats and make reports to them like we all do, doesn't mean they work togther, maybe show some proof of your claims that AOH=Pedophilia

             THank you for your reply.  I'm surprised you would say to post the claims, when there's plenty of information above and in the attachments to prove that something is not right.
            </p>
            <p>
             First, as Ark of Hope is registered as a charity, can you please post its financials seeing as your are somewhat affiliated?
            </p>
            <p>
             Second, can you provide evidence of ANY charity work that Ark of Hope does.  I can find none.  That information is very easily found if it's a real charity. As I said, Ark provides nothing on it's 'charity' activities. The only thing I can recall is a note from its founder, Blair Corbett, saying that he was closed down by the authorities for keeping kids in his basement.  I will try to find that message and attach it.
            </p>
            <p>
             As clearly shown above, Ark's ambassador is Robert Strongbow, whose notinmyworld features an owl. Strongbow goes by the name of Blackhorn33.  Again, this is another fake charity.
            </p>
            <p>
             You say you don't know what Ark of Hope's connection to NCMEC is, and yet YOU are the one retweeting Ark and Ark's website clearly provides a link to NCMEC.
            </p>
            <p>
             You are being deliberately obtuse and that surprises me considering how on-point and sharp you were during the initial stages of your investigations. Something has changed. Your are now affiliated with NCMEC by a few degrees of separation.

              I'm not affiliated with anyone, and if you actually looked at Ark of Hope's website, you would see what they are doing, I don't demonize every non profit that tries to help kids. Ark of Hope provides live chatrooms with volunteers who also take calls and emails to listen to survivors stories, they also do major awareness campaigns through social media providing information, resources, and

               Thank you for that info about the chat lines and their 990s.  Your statement about my whole post being bs is unfortunate.  I still don't understand why, after all your agitation and foot-stomping about mcmec, you would choose to endorse aoh and its ambassador, Strongbow aka Blackhorn33.  I have noticed that since last year's post he has removed his referral to MAKEITULTRA.

              <p>
               If this is coming down to a RT not being in support of anyone, then that is what should be said, but it's kind of a weak defense. We've been relying on follows and RTs, etc. as a way of proving relationships, and most of these trails turn out to be accurate. So IF someone does RT something because it purports to be helping children, they should make that clear. It's difficult to remember every freakin' organization involved in this shit, so that would be the way to go.
              </p>
              <p>
               Because that's not the way either of you went, I can only conclude this is another example of unfairness in getting rid of thread you don't like, and that's too damn bad. You're supposed to offer free speech, and refuting thing is fine, but not when you take advantage of your positions here and delete threads on the basis of conjecture and miscategorizing something as having ''no proof'' when it did offer ''proof by way of quotes and links''.

              <p>
               You're encouraged to disagree, but burying something isn't the way to go.

             <p>
              How does retweeting a positive message by someone on Twitter make anyone "somewhat affiliated"? That's just complete bullshit.
             </p>
             <p>
              Also, just saying these guys are fake because you haven't seen X or Y doesn't make them fake. You need to provide linked evidence they are not divulging something required of organizations claiming similar status. Yet here you are, making a false claim Honeybee_ is "affiliated" and then requiring her to provide financials you say are required and missing (with no evidence). This is the logical equivalent of asking her "Are you still beating your children?" No matter how she responds, you've framed her. It's completely dishonest.

               Vindicator, I would absolutely LOVE for Melissa to prove me wrong, but she hasn't. When she retweets AOF, she is in fact signalling that she approves of what they do.  She has 30,000+ followers. If they are blindly following, which I imagine most are, they will immediately assume that AOH is legit, which at the moment is not the case.  There is NOTHING on its website that is evidence of its legitimacy, but there are tonnes of red flags that it is a sham.
              </p>
              <p>
               If you bothered to read my post, you would see that I have not 'claiming' anything. I am asking a question: why is HoneyBee retweeting AOH considering they're sketchy (and there's plenty of evidence that they are).  She has not been able to answer me.
              </p>
              <p>
               I am asking her to provide financials because, unlike a legit charity, there is nothing that I can find regarding the finances of AOH.  Perhaps HoneyBee has access to information that the rest of us are not privy to, and I would love that to be the case.  She has a fantastic opportunity here to clear the air and give us the facts.  But instead I see her sidestepping and giving a very defensive answer.  As I have said, I had a huge amount of respect for her, but this is as shady af.

                "Considering they're sketchy" is a claim, and you have not provided any evidence of it. The very first thing I did was look to see if you had made any previous posts about Ark of Hope. I expected to see a solid thread providing all kinds of evidence about them. But all I found was the very same year-old thread you linked at the end of your post...which low and behold is a copypasta word for word of the vast majority of this thread...with all of the same problems. Circular argumentation. Repeating yourself is not evidence and doesn't meet the Rule 2 requirements of this subverse.

            I could be totally wrong, but I am just not seeing anything here at all that suggests pedophilia, have you asked Honeybee about any of this?

              Well I said I could be wrong. I definitely am not the best researcher. The problem is this post isn't very clear and hard to follow and I have found a few contradictions in the opinions stated.  Like this:
             </p>
             <p>
              <a href="https://notinmyworld.org/">
               https://notinmyworld.org/
              </a>
              'how did you like how I told the story, how we had to sacrifice somebody????'
             </p>
             <p>
              (Where exactly is that comment I just can't find it?)
             </p>
             <p>
              Click on another link and this is what you find:
             </p>
             <p>

                 Ok I don’t know why this guy seems like all the rest . I nearly had an anxiety attack at the end of this “ testimony “ from AOH when he was asking for “ donations “ basically .  The testimony was a letter he read from a child he helped break away from an abusive family .
                 <a href="https://youtu.be/ltfs_XF8BCI">
                  https://youtu.be/ltfs_XF8BCI
                 </a>
                 I’m sorry , maybe I just don’t trust anyone claiming to help children who ask for money anymore . Non profits that claim to help children have always been suspicious to us . So now all of the sudden we are supposed to trust them? You see where I’m coming from ? At this point I’m more interested in checking out more details on AOH and all affiliates than I am about honeybee knowing they’re shady . I just have had the utmost respect for her and when I saw this post  , I felt completely sideswiped !

An unidentified former vice-president of SnapNames.com, which is a subsidiary of Oversee.Net, Inc., manipulated the auction and drove up prices for domain name purchasers by making the shill bids, contends a lawsuit filed today in Miami-Dade Circuit Court by the Cueto law firm.

             <p>
              Because people sign up for the app for a $1 then get a bill for $34 dollars. Every complaint is that, like with so many apps today. Tracking apps are used by parents, spouses, employers and are actually very common. Pedo's probably do use them as well, those compliants don't reflect that, or anything close.

Where are they sheltering these 'victims'? 
Where are the financials for this organisation? None appear on its website. 
Where does Ark talk about ANY of its charity work?  I can find none.

              Why would they ever state were victims come from, if their protecting them from harmful situations ?
             </p>
             <p>
              They very well could be sheltering these victims, in the 8 bedroom house they own.

                     Everything about those people gives me the creeps . I went to their FB and seriously, the pics of them and all their adopted kids , some were disabled , it all just sent me a bad vibe . They are totally pushing the whole “ main stream Christianity “ theme that goes along with being that “ special “ couple that will fool many behind the guise of “ Jesus “ and get to adopt as many kids as they want because hey , they have been abused as kids too and since statistics show that a very large number of abused turn into abusers themselves then let’s find as many victims to adopt more victims to continue this degenerative cycle !

                       I’m wondering the same thing here ? It bothers me that you never got a reply on twitter ? It bothers me that they say you provided no evidence .  Oh and the chastising is very unsettling.  I don’t feel you were targeting HB . If I saw that tweet as you did , and I remembered that over a year ago I did research on said shady organization, I would have said what is this all about too !

                         Oh then I’m mistaken. I didn’t see if or when you did reply .  So have you had a chance to check out AOH and friends ? Still doesn’t look a bit shady ?

            Atko the majority of people on this forum think the mods are pedos, can we replace them by a "voat"?  The Pizzagate Mods forum is obviously also compromised so would be a redundant avenue to pursue.  Atko can you help us?

             We further have reason to believe the Mods are Mossad and your corporation in uncovering potential war crimes

             Psychological warfare perpetrated upon an apparently free citizenry undermines the rule of law and decency and violates the Geneva Convention as well as Federal and State laws.  Please keep this in mind as you reach your decision regarding the Mods.

            Honeybee is one of the pedo protecting mods here, so you should have known this thread was going to get a warning. That was automatic. Honeybee tells people the FBI is legit, get evidence to them, and offers FBI criminal complaint forms. Honeybee has been called out for profiting from PG, and trying to be a personality.  I don't understand why those who are supposedly red pilled get caught up with these suddenly appearing personalities that coax you to follow them and praise them. There is nothing I like or repect about that disingenuous opportunistic individual. I put here in the company of PizzagateGear, Seaman, Titus Frost and the rest of the online beggars and scammers.

             I have always respected HoneyBee.  That's why I'm shocked that she's promoting this organisation.    Your language and lack of critical thinking says more about you than it does about anyone else.  And you do HoneyBee no favours whatsoever with your ignorant comment.

             I didn't say they were shills.  I am asking for an explanation, especially now that they will be made aware of the facts.

            Very disturbing info, but a lot of very big names are exposing themselves. Either people are going to wake the hell up or just go along for a trip that is in the opposite direction of the truth.

              David Koresh was rumored to be sexually abusing minors.
             </p>
             <p>
              He really does resemble Keith Raniere. Think they're working on prototypes in creating these cult leaders. I guess my question now is whether the compound was destroyed because of sex trafficking. Was Koresh farming out these children to polticians, etc.? I haven't heard that brought up, but knowing what we do now, might be good to explore and either prove and disprove whether that was involved.

               Not just politicians, but to Military, too. The kids were also subject to SRA abuse and studies were being performed on the effects of sexual abuse and how it could be weaponized.  Fort Hood was used as a staging area during the siege.  No coincidence, because Fort Hood is the location where most of the children were abused.  The entire Waco incident was a witness elimination mission.  Were children abused at the compound?  Maybe. But it's much more likely that the children were leased out to the military and the Branch Davidians were financed by Uncle Sam. When the children began to tell their parents, that is when the program was cleaned.

                Yes, I'm thinking along those lines. It was the early prototype of what they're doing now. Only NXIVM was more sophisticated in terms of getting these sex slaves in positions of power. Probably, Playboy and Hefner previously held that role.

             If you're referring to the pinned tweet, it's not the video of Ark of Hope.  It's a video made by No Restrictions Entertainment, and the trio listed, of which Ark of Hope supported the creation of.

                Ark of Hope's pinned tweet may be for a movie, but they are clearly associating themselves with:
   (a)  Tracy Beanz;
   (b)  Hagmann Report;
   (c) Asian American Hotel Owners Association;
   (d)  SGT Report

               , could you please edit your post and add a link to Honeybee_'s tweet of July 29?
              </p>
              <p>
               Also, could you explain in a sentence or two in which way Tracy Beanz and the Hagman Report support Ark of Hope or Ark of Hope supported the creation of the video, and who did it?

                 repeated his claims
                </a>

               <p>
                He claims to be just asking questions to give Honeybee_ a chance to explain (without ever actually proving anything NEEDS to be explained), but then

                 deepens the attack

                 , I suggest you take the rules and the mods seriously here, because if you choose not to, you'd better hope your posts and arguments are airtight.  If they're not, I'll dismantle you and everything you've posted here in a way that makes you regret making your account.
                </p>
                <p>
                 I trust my mods to ping me when necessary, but I do
                 <em>
                  not
                 </em>
                 like being pinged.
                </p>
                <p>
                 Since I'm feeling EXTREMELY charitable right now, I'll give you a small dose of what you'll find in response to far more of your content than you would ever imagine.

                 It is NOT on ANYONE ELSE to prove that ArkofHope is a charity.  It is on YOU to prove that it is NOT.  YOU are the one making the claim, and attempting to push the burden of proof onto someone else to prove the opposite is

                 I'm reserving my judgement for the time being. I'd like to hear an explanation though. HoneyBee has not responded to me on twitter.  I have also tweeted Tracy Beanz and Hagmann Report, neither of whom have as yet responded (but I tweeted them only an hour ago).

                    True voaters know you are the genuine real deal and will have your back.  Best solution is to reply once then ignore.  Trolls just like to steal you time from the real work you are doing.  It is SO important what you do.......just continue being the lovely you that you are! Q. If He ☝🏻 is for us who can be against us? A. No one  🙏

                  Do your job and stop putting in question legit threads. If you must label everything to control the spin, go label Q threads, "posiible larp disinfo". Or, "unverified anonymous hearsay". Resign, take Vindicator with you. Leave AreWeShill, I'll handle that one.

               The question was for Melissa . In  2016 she had everyone who was banned for tweeting to NCEMC put on a list . I was under the impression she was going to do something with that and maybe get us unbanned? I just want to know what the purpose was? She is active on twitter and never helped us get our accounts back . Just wonder why ?

                It was Melissa who was one of the first to go after and investigate NCMEC. It clearly states on Ark of Hope's website that they are associated with NCMEC.  Doesn't make sense that she would now be associated with an organisation linking itself to NCMEC

                 , Piscina here is the one "associating" Melissa with NCMEC and Ark of Hope. You are commenting on his thread...did you actually read his linked "evidence"? What if he uses another account in six months to attack you for "associating" with Piscina who he claims you are affiliated with? This thread is loaded to the gills with shill tactics all designed to smear with nothing more than innuendo. Now you are thinking she has something to do with your account getting banned from Twitter??? After all the hell we've been through with disinfo pushers on

                  It was because of Melissa Honeybee and David Seaman that I even heard of pizzagate.  I watched every one of her videos, she is a die hard reporter of child abuse/trafficking and exposing the peods.  I don't know whats going on but how can people turn on her in a second? I am shocked.  Let her explain, if she has not replied yet she is obviously busy.  She has NOT turned away from her initial goal, I don't believe all the things people are saying until we hear from her.  C'mon guys.

                   I understand that is the case for a lot of people. I was looking into pizzagate before those two so my experience and perspective are a bit different. I agree that both Melissa and Seaman have brought attention to the pizzagate issue through their open online presence and there is much value in that, which I recognize.  But I am a different type of researcher and one of the functions (I believe) of people like me is to draw attention to something if it does not look or feel right. I have some experience of the 'games people play' in the online research community. We don't always get it right, it's not fun to be critical of someone else, especially if they are putting themselves 'out there'  but  sometimes critics perform a needed levelling function. There's much more I could say on this particular issue but I won't because I don't enjoy being part of any discord.  Piscina's post though is a valuable one as we all need 'quality checks' occasionally.

                 Exactly why I’m so curious to find out what her plans were for that list . My account was 10 years old and it was for work only . Pizzagate broke out and I used it to red pill over 500 clients . The people who followed me were business related and I lost all of them and was told they would not reinstate my account ! They gave me NO reason ! That’s just what they decided to do after tweeting to Laura Silsby .

               I HAVE asked her on twitter.  Yesterday and today repeatedly.  She didn't respond, although Ark did with a snide comment.

              Okay.  In my trawling of Google search engine, Ark of Hope has supported THEM, not the other way around.   It's possible they are sharing the support back, without realizing what you've unearthed?  I mean I really hope that's the case.  I'd hate to think we were being dragged around by fake people.

               Tracy Beanz is a fraud. She knew that Pamphlet from CBTS Patriot Stream was larping as Q and scamming people out of their money. When she got called out she said "I didn't think it was responsibility to tell people who Q is."

               But you are always being dragged around by fake people. Because you get behind internet heroes. That individual is the happiest person I have ever seen talking about PG, besides that other pig Simply whatever her names is and her fake delicate act. Tell me, what has HoneyBee revealed?

               No, Melissa is retweeting Ark of Hope--as I said, on 29th of July.

               I have had the utmost respect for Melissa, but she's either been paid off or she's been duped.  I hope she responds here or on twitter.
