<p>&quot;Sen. Rand Paul (R-KY) last week tried to block billions in U.S. taxpayer funds from going to the Afghan military and police forces unless its units stopped sexually abusing young boys, but he was opposed by Senate Foreign Relations Committee leaders.</p>
<p><strong>During a committee business meeting last Wednesday considering the reauthorization of the Trafficking Victims Protection Act of 2000, Paul proposed an amendment to withhold all U.S. funding for all Afghan security forces unless the U.S. government’s watchdog in Afghanistan could verify those forces were not using children as child soldiers or sex slaves.</strong></p>
<p>The U.S. is slated to provide Afghan security forces — military and police — with $4.92 billion in 2019 for equipment, training, supplies, services, infrastructure repair and other funding.</p>
<p>Paul told other members, according to a transcript of the business meeting first obtained by Breitbart News: “I think that the committee is right to be gravely concerned with sexual trafficking and abuse of young people around the world in a variety of countries. I think we shouldn’t turn a blind eye towards when our allies are responsible for this, as well.”</p>
<p><strong>Specifically, Paul referred to the common Afghan practice of “bacha bazi” — or using boys as young as 10 years old for sex. Some U.S. troops who have deployed to Afghanistan have tried to stop instances of sexual abuse when they have come across it, but have been punished for doing so, according to reports.</strong></p>
<p><strong>He brought up the case of former Army Special Forces Capt. Dan Quinn, who beat up an Afghan commander for keeping an approximately 10-year-old boy chained to his bed as a sex slave and beating up his mother when she tried to rescue him. Quinn was relieved of command as a result.</strong></p>
<p>“His complaint was we’re putting people into power who could do things even far worse than things the Taliban did, and that these views were expressed to him as he traveled throughout Afghanistan,” Paul said during the committee meeting.</p>
<p>“My amendment would say that no Afghan entity is allowed to receive funds from the U.S. until the Special Inspector General (SIGAR) verifies that there are no child soldiers or sex slaves, commonly known as bacha bazi, being utilized by any individual or unit within the department,” he said.</p>
<p><strong>However, Chairman Bob Corker (R-TN) and Ranking Member Bob Menendez (D-NJ) backed a counter-amendment to require the Departments of Defense and State to report on implementation of recommendations made by SIGAR on ending the practice.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Corker said he had “major concerns” with Paul’s approach, calling it unachievable.</strong></p>
<p>“While I enthusiastically support the spirit of Senator Paul’s amendment, and understand what he’s trying to do, I have major concerns with the approach his amendment takes. It would guarantee the withdraw of U.S. support for Afghanistan by setting an unachievable standard requiring the SIGAR verification that there are zero cases of sexual slavery or the utilization of child soldiers by any unit or even individual within the Afghan military or police forces,” he said.</p>
<p>Corker added that such a withdrawal of U.S. support would be problematic from a “broad U.S. national security standpoint,” but eliminate the U.S.’s ability to try to end the practice.</p>
<p>Paul argued that blocking U.S. funds would provide some punishment for the practice and have some effect, whereas requiring a report would have “no effect.”</p>
<p>“Having a report on this will have no effect, and I think essentially turns a blind eye to a horrific practice that’s going on there,” he said. “I think many of us here would say we should have zero tolerance for having sex slaves.”</p>
<p>“We can’t have zero tolerance for sex slaves? Sure, we should, and if there’s evidence of it, they shouldn’t be getting any of our money. And so I absolutely think that we need a stronger version of it, and that the second degree would gut it and make it meaningless and in essence show tacit support for allowing the practice to continue,” he added.</p>
<p><strong>Paul’s amendment failed, while Corker’s passed.</strong></p>
<p><strong>The current Leahy Law already requires U.S. military aid to be cut off to any foreign military unit implicated in gross human rights violations, which includes bacha bazi. But another U.S. law states that military aid should be provided to Afghanistan “notwithstanding any other provision of law,” which has been used to evade cutting off that aid.</strong></p>
<p>Quinn is not the only former service member who had been punished for trying to stop instances of bachi bazi they encountered. His fellow Army Green Beret Sgt. First Class Charles Martland was nearly discharged for participating in the beating up of the commander.</p>
<p>A 2015 New York Times article told the story of Marine Lance Corporal Gregory Buckley Jr., who told his father he was instructed to look the other way on bacha bazi. He was later killed by one of a group of boys living in barracks with an Afghan police commander, one floor below where the Marines slept.</p>
<p>Another Marine, Maj. Jason Brezler, who had known of the Afghan commander from a previous deployment was punished and nearly discharged for trying to warn a Marine unit about the same Afghan police commander, by emailing a classified report on the Afghan commander to fellow Marines over his personal email to fellow Marines who were deployed.</p>
<p>SIGAR earlier this year said in a report that there was no formal policy instructing troops to ignore the practice, but said the U.S.’s continuing to provide assistance to Afghan units for which there is credible information of a gross violation of human rights “undermines efforts by U.S. government officials to engage with the Afghan government on the importance of respect for human rights and rule of law.” &quot;</p>',

            I’ve thought for a long time that one of the reasons why ptsd is seemingly so much more prevalent today than in say ww2 is that witness of child rape is part of it. I've heard of a few stories now where soldiers would hear children moaning and screaming at night when they were stationed right next to Afghani military bases, and they knew what was going on but were told to ignore it. Makes you wonder though why the green beret didn't just kill the guy, though. That's what he is trained for, and as their slogan goes- de opresso Libre- to free the oppressed... He must have been scared shitless by someone into not pulling the trigger

            I hate Robert Menendez so much. I spent a few years rallying the troops to fight a bill of his but we ultimately lost when it passed in the MOTHERS Act. It was supposed to be mandatory mental health screening of all women in the country during pregnancy and after birth, along with funding for programs to drug moms. It ended up passing as a non mandatory screening and funding of PPD agencies in Obamacare. This is passed in NJ as mandatory screening for all women. Brooke Shields was the celebrity proponent of it. Turns out she starred in a film role as a child prostitute and was actually mostly nude in it. I have always wondered if she was actually MK Ultra'ed. Seems like it.

            I was really super disappointed that he did not get convicted. He is also really annoying and obnoxious and I don't understand his appeal with voters. Must be all the pharma companies in NJ that keep him in office.

             I think he'll go down eventually.  His slime trail connects to all kinds of bad actors, at least some of whom are without doubt the subjects of secret grand jury investigations.

           </p>
           <p>
            "Sens. Mark Kirk (R-Ill.) and Robert Menendez (D-N.J.) on Tuesday evening unveiled their bill to impose new sanctions on Iran if international negotiators fail to reach a deal by June 30 on Tehran's nuclear program.
           </p>
           <p>
            Fourteen other senators co-sponsored the the Nuclear Weapon Free Iran Act of 2015  — eight Republicans and six Democrats: Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.), and Sens. Charles Schumer (D-N.Y.), Kelly Ayotte (R-N.H.), Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.), Dan Coats (R-Ind.), Gary Peters (D-Mich.), Marco Rubio (R-Fla.), Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.), Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.), Joe Donnelly (D-Ind.), Ted Cruz (R-Texas), Bob Casey Jr. (D-Pa.), Richard Burr (R-N.C.) and Roy Blunt (R-Mo.). 
...The bill allows the president to continuously waive sanctions for a 30 days at a time, if a deal is near.
...It also requires the administration to formally submit the text of any new nuclear agreement or extension of talks to Congress within five days."

            “The announcement this week by the Justice Department that they were bringing charges against Bob Menendez — I will point out that the timing seems awfully coincidental that … in the very week that Bob Menendez showed incredible courage to speak out and call out President Obama for the damage that his policy is doing to our national security … the Justice Department announces they’re moving forward with the criminal prosecution,” Cruz said.
           </p>
           <p>
            “It raises the suggestion to other Democrats that if you dare part from the Obama White House, that criminal prosecutions will be used potentially as a political weapon against you as well,” he added.

            A new report on pervasive child sexual abuse among Afghan security personnel, prepared by the independent Special Inspector General for Afghanistan Reconstruction (SIGAR), is being suppressed by Pentagon officials. In its place, the Defense Department has issued a highly technical report, which laments procedural shortcomings but omits a full account of the systematic pederasty by Afghan officers that American forces have basically ignored for 15 years.
           </p>
           <p>
            “The results of SIGAR’s unreleased inquiry, which was requested by 93 members of Congress in 2015, remains classified at the Pentagon’s direction, raising questions about the military’s transparency and the extent to which it is complying with laws meant to curb such behavior,” according to the Washington Post.
           </p>
           <p>
            Selling and using young boys (often dressed as girls) for sex—known colloquially as bacha bazi, or “boy play”—has deep roots in Afghanistan and has been widely practiced for generations. A State Department report in 2010 described the extent of the problem: “Child abuse was endemic throughout the country, based on cultural beliefs about child-rearing, and included general neglect, physical abuse, sexual abuse, abandonment, and confined forced labor to pay off family debts.” It also noted that “most child sexual abusers were not arrested.” American officers, who share quarters with Afghan ones, report boys screaming in agony, which they were instructed to ignore.
           </p>
           <p>
            In 2010, I called on the Obama administration to acknowledge the problem and draw a clear moral line: “The president should inform our representatives in Afghanistan that although we shall continue to put up with much that we do not condone, there are limits to our accommodations. We shall neither finance nor protect a regime that refuses to act against large-scale sexual abuse of children.” I renewed this call in 2012 and 2016.
           </p>
           <p>
            Formally, bacha bazi is illegal in Afghanistan. And according to the State Department’s 2017 report on human trafficking, the Afghan government has recently started to pursue criminal cases against those involved in bacha bazi, including several Afghan soldiers and police officials; however—the majority of these few cases had their charges dropped. That’s partly because, the report notes, “most who engage in bacha baazi paid bribes to, or had relationships with, law enforcement, prosecutors, or judges that effectively exempted them from prosecution.” Exactly how widespread this problem is remains unknown, as scant data is available, which makes reports like SIGAR’s all the more crucial. It leaves no doubt that the vile practice is pervasive. American officials often argue that we sink blood and hundreds of billions of dollars into this Godforsaken country—“where empires go to die”—in order to foster human rights and democracy, not just to curb terrorism. It points with pride to the many girls who have been enrolled in schools since the US ousted the Taliban. Nevertheless, it is widely acknowledged that Afghanistan is one of the most corrupt nations in the world, and produces about 90% of the world’s heroin. One should add to this list of troubling failures—the continued mass, institutionalized pedophilia, practiced by the Afghan elites.

            There is no excuse for this.  None.  I don't care what they say or come up with.  15 yrs.  As the boys suffered in agony.  They are looking the other way as the men have their way with 10 yr. old boys   My brain can't even process this.  The DOD ignored their people viewing CP on their laptops and now they are ignoring the rape of young boys.  I can't even........

              I have seen that and it confirmed what I had already thought about the Weasel.  There is also a video of him with Nora O'Donnell explaining how DEW works.  Direct Electronic Weapon   I think it might be scrubbed by now.  It's how they have been starting the fires all over the country.   These guys are dying out soon.  We have to make sure they are not replaced.

               Oh I would have loved to see that video. I’m glad you are aware of the DEWs and understand that these are what is causing the fires around the world, California, Alberta, Greece, etc.  One thing I am stuck on is whether it is HAARP or the DEWs doing the flooding, tsunamis, tornados, etc. This shit makes me sick and even sicker when no one knows the truth of the matter. I recall reading about Alberta Canada wildfires and their gov was taking CASH DONATIONS to help those who had no where to go and lost everything. They raised something like $66 million dollars and absolutely nothing to show where that money went and those people never saw the cash raised. Same with The Red Cross saying they were going to pay out people who had to flee and give them $1k each but no one received a dime. Unbelievable to say the least.

              A local reported that the growing of poppies and dancing boys had been eradicated under the Taliban with penalty of death. US started both back up. The situation went from bad to worse.

              Well, I was wondering about Rand Paul.  I knew Corker and Bob M were Deep State.  One more we can count on.  They make new laws to cancel out old laws that are still in place.  Laws that people don't even know exist.   Nice to see you around.

               Could the "dancing boys" be one of the reasons so many of our veterans are committing suicide after serving in Afghanistan? They are repulsed by the rapes of children by men who they had been taught to respect?

                Wondered this myself. Got a work friend with PTSD who will tell me lots of war storied but he absolutely refuses to talk about one specific thing. Something tells me it's something of this nature. Dear Heavenly Father, how much longer will you suffer the blood of your innocents to be spilt in this way!? Please make things right.

                YES!  Exactly and why many have PTSD.  I would not be surprised if the really young men get raped by the elders in charge.  17 yr olds are probably highly prized.  It's all so sick.  The Military needs a complete overhaul.  COMPLETE.

              Aga khan has set up five star hotels in war zones ..why..? Blackmail operations to control war zone administration like in afghanistan..
I bet he is the control point to child trafficking in afghanistan and thr planet...i bet the afghan commanders are trafficking these kids to taliban in exchange for information or vice versa..
Pakistan afghanistan india...the ughhh of the deep state for centuries

               Excellent theory I totally agree with you. Sounds exactly like something they would do. Isn’t Aga Khan one of Canada’s ring masters? He was there for some kind of speech a year back and people came by the droves praising him and how wonderful he is, what a moral upstanding citizen, a man with integrity. It was sickening to hear.

                I thiink the sppech ure talking about is his speech to the Canadian parliament...during the speech he brings the topic of training children , and he pauses and.sneers at the mp's ...as if he just shared an inside joke with them..
He and hisnpredecessors are mi6 deep state actors...he was instrumental in the initian of the indian muslik league that instigated the formation of pakistan..an mi6 deep state asset in tue thirld world..
Pakistan and deep.state actors in inida like dawood ibrahimn are goffers for aga khan and mi6 criminal networks..
They transfer counterfeit currency in exchange for. Services like human trafficking and child.prostitution networks run in inida..
