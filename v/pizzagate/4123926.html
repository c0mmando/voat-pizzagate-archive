Last year, a post by entylawyer on Crazy Days and Nights explained that Heather O\'Rourke was basically raped after filming Rocky Road (which was cancelled after 6 episodes were quickly filmed in order to cover this incident up). This incident was the root cause of her death. Warning, this is a very stomach churning lead!</p>

<p>This chapter dives into a from Enty Lawyer. The timelime of the crime has changed.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.crazydaysandnights.net/2020/11/four-for-friday-tomb.html?m=1">https://www.crazydaysandnights.net/2020/11/four-for-friday-tomb.html?m=1</a> A horriffic story brought to my attention by <a href="https://voat.co/u/millennial_vulcan">@millennial_vulcan</a>. The details of this Blind Item have proven to be a significant new lead. Also verifies what Maccauly Culkin claimed regarding the red shoes (by solidifying the timeline). The messages &quot;ALL WORN OUT - RR&quot; (&quot;Rocky Road&quot;) (episode: &quot;Moscow on the Boardwalk&quot;) and &quot;BK KILLED ME&quot; (Bruce Kane- developer of Rocky Road) were sprayed on her tomb in red spray paint. In addition, her tomb has been exhumed twice. 1991 and 1992.</p>
<p>All Worn Out is code for the typical fate of pedo ring victims who are frequently passed around.</p>
<p>Given how aggressively Tammy O’Rourke tries to deny that Heather was a Pedowood victim, it is entirely possible that the O’Rourke family received threats on that fateful day in 1989.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/education/2002/mar/19/arts.highereducation">https://www.theguardian.com/education/2002/mar/19/arts.highereducation</a> Is Plastination how the corpse swap was done while looking so well preserved? The technique was around since 1977, meaning that Hollywood big shots could afford to pull it off.</p>
<p>Anons, given how Heather’s corpse was gone from her tomb for three days, I have to put out a truly awful theory. You may have to get your barf bags ready.</p>
<p>Since these hell spawn are willing to dig up a child’s grave to skin the corpse to make red shoes, it is entirely possible that Heather’s corpse may have been violated in more than one way. I’m refering to necrophilia. </p>
<p>Timeline: </p>
<p>-Poltergeist Series. Three incidents over a period of 5 years ranging from 1982 to summer of 1987. The crimes themselves occured in Simi Valley, California, Culver City, CA, Altadena, CA, and Chicago, Illinois. Suspects: Steven Spielberg, Frank Marshall, Tobe Hooper (dead), Gary Sherman.</p>
<p>Accomplices: Judy Wix</p>
<p>-Happy Days: Most Likely Suspects: Garry Marshall (dead), Bobby Hoffman (dead), Henry Winkler, Tom Hanks, Rob Reiner. Accomplice: Penny Marshall (dead).</p>
<p>-The Fatal Incident. Note that this incident is the START of Heather\'s fatal down turn rather than a quick death. Location: On the set of Rocky Road. Hollywood, California.</p>
<p>Time: November 7, 1986. The incident backstage involved anally violating her with a foreign object. 3 men were involved. Execs flocked to the studio, so its possible for a culprit to be one of the flockers. A medic was called in likely because what they did perforated her colon. The injury was severe enough that it also inflicted either penetrative or blunt force trauma on her small intestine, more specifically, her ileum. For this reason, I suspect that the object itself was a hard object. Possibly made of metal or some other hard material. I’d say the object in question was about 10-14” long. Heather\'s illness (the one that was covered up) first started to manifest around December 1986. I suspect that the Chrons diagnosis was the cover up. The episode was released in May of 1987. She was on medication throughout filming of Poltergeist 3 as her condition worsened. Heather\'s health took its fatal downward spiral on 1/31/1988 before she died on 2/1/1988. The funeral was an open casket event on 2/5/1988. Heather’s family is threatened in 1989? The &quot;skinning&quot; wasin 1991. Heather was interred in an above ground mausolium according to accounts of those who attended the funeral. </p>
<p>Suspects (Rocky Road): Gene Abravaya, Bruce Kane (C),  Arthur Annecharico, Chris Colombus, Richard Vane (C),  Lewis Arquette. (C) confirmed.</p>
<p>Accomplice (others): Wesley Staples. Corey Feldman. He actively covers for the big pedowood names and their crimes, which would make him an accomplice. Other accomplices include the MSM, Patrick Little and Tom Steyer due to their involvement in the attempted false flag along with Gabe Hoffman for protecting Steven Spielberg. Ted Turner. Fredrick Brennan for deplatforming 8chan, a site that was providing informants in this case. Richard Bretzing.</p>
<p>-Cause of Death: Sepsis infection and intestinal stenosis of the ileum (last 1/3 of small intestine) due to repeated anal rape related injuries and infections. The main incident responsible was the injury to her small intestines as a result</p>',

           . The details of this Blind Item have proven to be a significant new lead. Also verifies what Maccauly Culkin claimed regarding the red shoes (by solidifying the timeline). The messages "ALL WORN OUT - RR" ("Rocky Road") (episode: "Moscow on the Boardwalk") and "BK KILLED ME" (Bruce Kane- developer of Rocky Road) were sprayed on her tomb in red spray paint. In addition, her tomb has been exhumed twice. 1991 and 1992.
          </p>
          <p>
           All Worn Out is code for the typical fate of pedo ring victims who are frequently passed around.
          </p>
          <p>
           Given how aggressively Tammy O’Rourke tries to deny that Heather was a Pedowood victim, it is entirely possible that the O’Rourke family received threats on that fateful day in 1989.

           Can’t believe I have to go back to this horrible topic yet again. Details on how leather is made. Note that preservatives are nessecary for the leather making process. In theory this would also include preserving a dead body.

           Is Plastination how the corpse swap was done while looking so well preserved? The technique was around since 1977, meaning that Hollywood big shots could afford to pull it off.
          </p>
          <p>
           Anons, given how Heather’s corpse was gone from her tomb for three days, I have to put out a truly awful theory. You may have to get your barf bags ready.
          </p>
          <p>
           Since these hell spawn are willing to dig up a child’s grave to skin the corpse to make red shoes, it is entirely possible that Heather’s corpse may have been violated in more than one way. I’m refering to necrophilia.
          </p>

           Timeline:
          </p>
          <p>
           -Poltergeist Series. Three incidents over a period of 5 years ranging from 1982 to summer of 1987. The crimes themselves occured in Simi Valley, California, Culver City, CA, Altadena, CA, and Chicago, Illinois. Suspects: Steven Spielberg, Frank Marshall, Tobe Hooper (dead), Gary Sherman.
          </p>
          <p>
           Accomplices: Judy Wix
          </p>
          <p>
           -Happy Days: Most Likely Suspects: Garry Marshall (dead), Bobby Hoffman (dead), Henry Winkler, Tom Hanks, Rob Reiner. Accomplice: Penny Marshall (dead).
          </p>
          <p>
           -The Fatal Incident. Note that this incident is the START of Heather's fatal down turn rather than a quick death. Location: On the set of Rocky Road. Hollywood, California.
          </p>
          <p>
           Time: November 7, 1986. The incident backstage involved anally violating her with a foreign object. 3 men were involved. Execs flocked to the studio, so its possible for a culprit to be one of the flockers. A medic was called in likely because what they did perforated her colon. The injury was severe enough that it also inflicted either penetrative or blunt force trauma on her small intestine, more specifically, her ileum. For this reason, I suspect that the object itself was a hard object. Possibly made of metal or some other hard material. I’d say the object in question was about 10-14” long. Heather's illness (the one that was covered up) first started to manifest around December 1986. I suspect that the Chrons diagnosis was the cover up. The episode was released in May of 1987. She was on medication throughout filming of Poltergeist 3 as her condition worsened. Heather's health took its fatal downward spiral on 1/31/1988 before she died on 2/1/1988. The funeral was an open casket event on 2/5/1988. Heather’s family is threatened in 1989? The "skinning" wasin 1991. Heather was interred in an above ground mausolium according to accounts of those who attended the funeral.
          </p>
          <p>
           Suspects (Rocky Road): Gene Abravaya, Bruce Kane (C),  Arthur Annecharico, Chris Colombus, Richard Vane (C),  Lewis Arquette. (C) confirmed.
          </p>
          <p>
           Accomplice (others): Wesley Staples. Corey Feldman. He actively covers for the big pedowood names and their crimes, which would make him an accomplice. Other accomplices include the MSM, Patrick Little and Tom Steyer due to their involvement in the attempted false flag along with Gabe Hoffman for protecting Steven Spielberg. Ted Turner. Fredrick Brennan for deplatforming 8chan, a site that was providing informants in this case. Richard Bretzing.
          </p>
          <p>
           -Cause of Death: Sepsis infection and intestinal stenosis of the ileum (last 1/3 of small intestine) due to repeated anal rape related injuries and infections. The main incident responsible was the injury to her small intestines as a result

            <strong>
             Has Leather Made from Human Skin ever been Sold?
            </strong>
           </p>
           <p>
            <strong>
             Yes, leather made from human skin has been sold in today’s society. There’s a website/company that make fashion products out of human skin (belts, wallets, etc), and that company is “Human Leather”. They state that the skin come from willing participants or donors who have signed off (before death) on turning their bodies into these items after they’ve passed away.
            </strong>
           </p>
           <p>
            <strong>
             The company shares that’s there’s prime parts of the body for making such products such as the back and abdomen because these areas have a good amount of uninterrupted “material” and is best for processing into human leather.
            </strong>
           </p>
           <p>
            <strong>
             The company’s products are very expensive (wallets starting at $14,000 and $27,000 for human leather footwear). The company is serious about privacy and don’t post photos of their finished products and there’s even a waiting list of their products.

           <p>
            <strong>
             The tanning process for human skin is the same as the traditional tanning process for animal leathers, and apparently, human leather is the finest grain leather and is the smoothest and softest leather on Earth.

             Human Leather is not the only one with their hands in human skin fashion pot. There’s a designer, Tina Gorjanc, who proposes to grow Alexander McQueen’s skin (McQueen was a couture designer who passed away in 2010) to create handbags and other designer accessories. She’s filed a patent for the method that would grow cell cultures from his DNA, and tan the resulting remake of McQueen’s skin into leather for luxury goods.

             Although all this may sound morbid, I wonder if we’re getting to a point in fashion where we can clone and/or grow celebrity flesh to make and sell fashion to the public. Maybe the famous question on the carpet “Who are you wearing?” (in terms of the designer of the clothing being worn) may later be a literal question. I mean… at least, in this day and age… it does sound weird to think that I could carry around Justin Timberlake right on my arm… or Lady Gaga on my waist, Kim Kardashian on my feet, and put my money and debit/credit cards in… Donald Trump. Maybe making skin in the lab will become more popular in the future. I guess the demand may come from those who are obsessed with their favorite celebrity and the famous in general.

            DK, we ought to dig up a working link to the original source of the Culkin shoes claim, for newbs who might stumble onto this and not know what you're referencing.
           </p>
           <p>
            Also, did we ever actually verify that was a real interview he gave? Or was that one of those can't prove/disprove items?
           </p>
           <p>
            Lastly, you should crosspost the link to this submission to the comments of CDaN. I'm sure the readers there would find your encyclopedic research very interesting!

              As I recall, it was allegedly in a European tabloid of some kind (Continental, not UK). Or perhaps it was a radio interview. I tried to track down the source a few years ago and only found screenshots and memes/graphics, not the original. I don't think I tried to scour Wayback and Archive.is though. Also, at the time, our search engine here was more limited and didn't allow Comment Search. SearchVoat added that my request, because so much of our research is buried in the comments when folks start collaborating. If I get time this week, I will take another look and see what I can track down.

                I did some digging through our original submissions on this topic. All sources were sketchy. Many of the original posts mentioned this was an interview Culkin did that was reported in the French financial magazine Les Echos. They also all say it was deleted when it went viral. There are dozens of stories debunking it as fake, in multiple different countries besides the US, including France and Germany. Just Google "Culkin Les Echos". I didn't dig deep enough to see if Les Echos also said it was fake.

                I did find this interesting article from Esquire, though:

                He eats blood sausage and says he didn't have it bad as a kid, and specifically says he wasn't sexually abused.

             Here’s a blind item reveal that basically confirms that certain stories about him are actively being suppressed. Given the date he received those threats, Enty is talking about Culkin’s red shoe story.
            </p>
            <p>
             The fact that “they” are so aggressive in scrubbing it and sending threats is pretty damning evidence he’s telling the truth.

              There was a comment or BI few years back (really trying to find/might have been scrubbed) that talked about how MC constantly breaks down to his girlfriend/fiancée
              <strong>
               Brenda Song

              and goes into major druggy episodes screaming out loud the names of who molested him. She has to drag him to isolation/rehab in case anyone overhears.
