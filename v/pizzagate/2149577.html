            The video for this post was unavailable, so I took it as an opportunity to state an opinion without distracting from PG research.  My original comment was down voated, and it's hard to see, so here it is again.  I challenge PG researchers to stop treating Flat Earthers the same way the elite treat PG victims, with insults, disrespect and disregard.  I am not a "troll," I am the victim of childhood sexual abuse, and I was married to a man who was raped by his own father and passed around to his father's friends, so PG is personal for me, and I'm just trying to warn people of
            <em>
             more
            </em>
            deception coming from the elite.
           </p>
           <hr/>
           <p>
            Original comment:  Well duh "Facebook" is censoring truth videos.  Otherwise we would have the truth much more often.
           </p>
           <p>
            Like how Flat and motionless the land we are standing on is.  Spinning in space.  Pfffft
           </p>
           <p>
            Not in this dome.  It's flat, and the skies move.
           </p>
           <p>
            If you are PG researchers, you should know that we are just trying to warn you of other satanic worshippers we happened to find while keeping a lookout.
           </p>
           <p>
            Stop treating Flat Earthers with disrespect before hearing what they have to say.  Because that's how victims are further victimized in this country.
           </p>
           <p>
            Geez, we just wanted to talk about math and film and forensic evidence.
           </p>
           <p>
            Go look at the space contraptions they said they landed on the moon in.  Honestly tell me you would let them pick you up 10 feet in that thing.
           </p>
           <p>
            The globe is a deception.  How do they hypnotize people?  With a circular pattern round and round, back and forth.  Sounds like a manual for how the torture and confuse victims.  Most likely PG victims.

            YELLOW SUBMARINE  is coming to my mind alot in the last couple of days. As  if a mind control program were so  capable, could this be the moment it  was always intended for?  We all live in a yellow submarine....facebook, online, sky of blue sea of green...flat earth.... antartica...Haiti....gratefully for some reason I detested the Beatles, sing song melodys that made me feel unsafe. I'd like to be under the sea...octopuss garden, suffocation, another freaky song. That Im feeling the impact of its meaning today

            Holy shit, just saw a PG/Flat Earth video.  I wish you guys would just listen for a minute to a victim trying to explain what some satanic sickos have been doing to us.

            Please, don't let them win this because we couldn't come together as a truth community.  PizzaGate and Flat Earth together could actually have a chance of draining the swamp.  It could do wonders for this world.

              Seriously, which one sounds more like a psyop?  Our flat land where the skies move, or theories about spinning through a vacuum, but the magic gravity makes it so you can't feel it?
             </p>
             <p>
              It's seriously like a religion the BS you have to imagine is happening.
             </p>

              They keep telling you your God given senses are deceiving you.  You think the land you are standing on is spinning 1000 mph, but magically you can't feel it?
             </p>
             <p>
              Numerous tests prove the land isn't moving.
             </p>
             <p>
              Where exactly do you think this 1000 mph is?  The atmosphere moves with the land??  Okay, so how come we don't have hundreds of cameras showing the shuttle being launched, like all angles, left, right, etc.  No, we get facing down at earth, and that's it.
             </p>
             <p>
              Watch every single launch ever, it's a real rocket going up, then a camera switch to CGI.  Every time.
             </p>
             <p>
              God, there have been pizza clues in movies and shows and commercials and books, but considering the hypnotic spinning globe that is EVERYWHERE in the media is telling us the truth?
             </p>
             <p>
              Seriously, which one sounds like a freak religion?  These satanists came in and fed us a bunch of bullshit, AND they got you to disrespect and disregard the simple measurements we can do for ourselves.
             </p>
             <p>
              The Bolivian Salt Flats is like 4000 square miles of flat.  Kansas is flatter than a pancake.  Here in Florida, it's flat AF.  So tell me where this ball makes up the curvature to keep the land spherical?
              <em>
               Where
              </em>
              is the curvature?  Cause I've only seen fish eye lens curves.
             </p>
             <p>
              People have sent weather balloons up 120,000 feet, and the horizon is flat AF.  So how far up do we have to be to see curvature??  Shouldn't this be standard knowledge in this day and age?
             </p>
             <p>
              The 100 mile long bridge in China should have 7000 feet of curvature in it, but it's flat, it was built flat, the blue prints for these kinds of structures assume a flat earth.
             </p>
             <p>
              Stop letting these bullshit artists tell you that the curve is there, but you have to imagine it in your head, or it's too small you can't notice it.  That's not science, it's lies.
             </p>
             <p>
              Stop being surprised they lied to us about this.  As someone below said, it's the biggest lie, and the easiest to prove a lie.  But you've seen that damn globe MILLIONS of times.  I know your brain thinks it's sure because it's seen many examples of it, ingrained over your whole life, but they are ALL cartoons.
             </p>
             <p>
              Just google "pictures of earth from space," and if you can't tell they are cartoons right away, then watch a Flat Earth video, and learn how America shouldn't change how big it is that much all the time.  The colors shouldn't change that much over time.  The amount of curve shouldn't change as much as it does.  It shouldn't have photoshopped clouds, which you can see when you zoom in.  The clouds shouldn't obviously spell sex, just like the cover of Little Mermaid shouldn't have a dildo on the front.
             </p>
             <p>
              Look up parallax, and tell me how the stars have been perfectly rotating around Polaris day after day, year after year.
             </p>
             <p>
              Gosh, just use some common sense and give yourself a chance to ask some questions before you make a decision on whether you really believe the globe.
             </p>
             <p>
              You can't say someone would have blown the whistle.  Cause that someone could have been a Seth Rich.
             </p>
             <p>
              They treat Flat Earth exactly like they treat PizzaGate, and I'm ashamed you people would rather insult truthers than have a look at the evidence for yourself.

                Not sure why you gave me architects and engineers for 9/11 truth.  I don't think you can call yourself a truther if you haven't thoroughly researched 9/11 and seen how much bunk science they've tried to feed us.
               </p>
               <p>
                Actually, 9/11 is a great example of how science is a religion.  The believers have FAITH in the official story, and refuse to listen to reason, and actually attack people who want to discuss the math.  Like, hmmmm, just how you are treating me.

                  This is what I'm saying.  The official narrative of the globe can be proven to be a fake and a fraud, just like 9/11.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  Try "200 Proofs Earth is Not a Spinning Ball" by Eric Dubay on YouTube.  There are so many inconsistencies and lies in the official story of this magical spinning ball.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  How did they calculate 1000 mph rotation?  What test did they use?  Because over and over again, Earth is found to be stationary.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  We see the same tactics being used against Flat earthers that they used against 9/11 truthers.  I'm not sure why you can't consider this possibility.

                 The math is irrelevant. Two timezones spaced is enough to obtain the indicative result. The reference stars are so far away that the curve will be noticeable by the offset of the reference stars in the simultaneously taken pictures.

                  Sorry, I still don't get it.  Are they pointing the camera straight up?  Straight at the stars?  A slight change of the camera angle is going to change everything, right?  I don't get how this proves flat vs round.

                  Plus "time zones" should work like the clock dome in Hunger Games Catching Fire.  But they aren't.  We use arbitrary lines for these time zones, when we should be making a pie cut into pieces with the center being the North Star.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  You don't wonder at all how the stars do absolutely perfect circles around Polaris, but somehow we are on a tilt rotating, while rotating around the sun.  The stars should be changing and moving all over the place.  We should be seeing stars depending on where we are around the sun.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  I've had enough of the optical illusion arguments.  That's not science.  Those stars are close to us and close together.  They are lights, and they move in a uniform pattern day after day, year after year.  That shouldn't happen in the heliocentric theory.

                   A kindergarten dropout already. The image is more than clear enough. It shows you the line-of-sights of each of the cameras and show you how the Pythagoras theorem forms the basis for creating the offset of the picked reference stars of the A and B cams. If you can't even understand the picture then you have no legitimacy trying to tell otherwise either.

                   The 3 pictures below the test-rig setup show the outcomes for the cam for a globe earth. The lines in the test-rig setup show WHY the pictures will look like shown. Now GTFO.

                    The Pythagorean theory is based on triangles, right?  And triangles have straight sides, right?   So how are you basing your measurements off this when you supposedly have curved lines below you?  How are you taking into account curvature?  How are you measuring anything based off this curve.
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    There really is no reason for insults.  I'm not insulting you, I'm challenging your experiment.  I don't understand how you are determining that the land below you is curved based on what the stars look like.  Moving away from each other on a flat plane would also change the angle of the stars.
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    Wouldn't the stars look "offset" from 3 people on a flat plane too?  How are you measuring curvature with this?  Wouldn't the angles be similar on a flat plane?  It's like you have to prove your friend is further away from the star because he is down a curve.
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    How much "curve" is this experiment proving there is on the globe?

                     The distance to the nearest star is several light-years away. The distance between two timezones is ~ 3300KM. 3300KM is virtually nothing compared to the nearest star (4.1 Light years) = 4.013337e+13km =  40,130,000,000,000km. That is why they won't look offset on a flat plane and all look centered.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     The dashed straight lines form the triangles, drawn for each cam. The curve causes an angle between the line-of-sights of the cams. See picture. Then a perpendular line across each line-of-sight shows how the reference stars will show up on the picture. Each cam has its own colored triangular dashed lines.

                     <li>

                       Place bottle of beer at farthest end of your livingroom/kitchen.

                     </li>
                     <li>
                      <p>
                       Go to opposite farthest end. Place phones on side, side-by side as if they were on a flat plane.
                      </p>
                     </li>
                     <li>
                      <p>
                       Bottle appears near centered on both.

                       Turn phones slightly away from each other, forming an arrow head. Watch bottle of beer offset.

                      Sorry, I still don't get it.  Honestly you sound like CIA cause you're trying to sound all super authority and smart while spitting out numbers none of us can test or repeat.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                      Give me a break with that light year stuff.  Whatever fancy equation you used to get that ridiculous number has never been verified.  You are guessing.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                      I still don't understand your picture.  The 3 examples look the same, except where they are on the picture.  The way the stars look is he same in all 3.  You just changed which was the camera was facing.  So if I'm directly under and take a picture straight up, the stars will be in the middle of the frame.  If I walk left and take a picture straight up, then the stars will be in the right side of the frame.  I can stand anywhere that can see the group of stars and point my camera my camera in different directions, but no matter how many I take, it doesn't prove what the land below me is doing.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                      If you're not CIA, then try using common sense before spouting pretend numbers about light years.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                      You know what proves a close sun?  The rays, coming through the clouds at angles.  The sun is close enough to the clouds to shine down through it at angles.  That is not how the light of the sun would work if it's 93 million miles away.  However, it's exactly how it would look if it was 3000 miles away.  It's a local spot light.  There is no denying this, and I don't want to hear ridiculous theories about light magically bending through the atmosphere to cause this.  We know how light works.  We can test and repeat it.  And there's no way the sun works in a heliocentric theory.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                      In fact, if stars were what they say they are, then the sky should be lit all over given the combination of all the lights supposedly out there.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                      Do you really think the stars just happen to make these patterns, when really they are supposedly millions of miles away?
                     </p>
                     <p>
                      I told you to look up parallax.  The stars should not be uniformly rotating around in perfect patterns.  The angles between them should change as we spin, we should see changes all the time in how the star patterns appear.

                      But we don't.  Because they are electromagnetic type lights in the dome.  Check out Nikon P900 footage of the stars.  Our skies are much more amazing than they led us to believe.

                       Just go do the experiment. Whether I am CIA or not or whether those distance numbers can be verified by you and me (without equipment) does not matter to the experiment. Just go do the experiment instead of trying to convince everyone of stuff with Yet Another Video.

                        I don't understand this experiment or how it proves anything.  Take pictures of the sky, then make an assumption about the land I'm standing on based off of them?  Give me a break.  Just watching those stars rotate is enough to convince me that the heliocentric model is BS.

                       <p>
                        Go research the moon landings.  Educate yourself about payloads and weight and rockets and craters and video editing.  Tell me you would let them take you off the ground in one of those homeless shelters they call a lunar lander.

                        The lies are right in your face.  Go spend some time at NASA.gov and come back and tell if you saw real science or a bunch of cartoon representations.

                        Seriously, go to NASA.gov, and let me know how many real pictures you see vs cartoons.

             Perhaps we could take the 20 BILLION dollars we give NASA every year and build some homes for the people in jail, so we can put the real criminals in the jails of their own making.

               Geez, I can't set up some cameras far away and make some measurements assuming the land is flat?  Why would you assume a globe beneath you and your friends.  Where is the science in this stupid picture?
              </p>
              <p>
               Where are some numbers where people actually tried this, and what are the numbers that prove it's a globe vs a flat plane.  What about the numbers proves the globe vs flat?
              </p>
              <p>
               If you can zoom in and see your friends, then it's probably because the land you're on is FLAT.
              </p>
              <p>
               Have you calculated curvature?  How much do you think the earth curves?
              </p>
              <p>
               How come I can see a mountain 300 miles away in a picture, even though it should be under the curve where I can't see it anymore?

                 For the Pythagorean, I need 2 sides to determine the third, but do you have the height of one of those stars?  How are you making any calculations without the exact distance of the star you guys are all pointing at?  What angels are you getting?  And how are they proving that you are on a ball rather than a flat plane?

                 Who looks more like the paid Soros disinfo troll?  You're just repeating your "science" that solely consists of a cartoon representation of what might really happen.  A cartoon that reminds me of the BS computer model for how Building 7 fell actually.

                 If I can't get to Antarctica, how can I speculate what's beyond it?  I don't know.  This isn't a religion.  The

               Did you do a little research into how much NASA gets every year?  Because otherwise your comment didn't help.  You said you were surprised, but then you brought up religion and race, spreading the hatred.
              </p>
              <p>
               That's what disinfo trolls do.  I'm trying to talk science, but now someone reading this thinks the Flat Earth discussion has to involve hating on people.

               I'm with Martin Luther King when he said he dreams of a world where people aren't judged by the color of their skin, but the content of their character.
              </p>
              <p>
               I don't care what religion or race you are.  It has nothing to do with the discussion, and I would appreciate it if you would leave it out of the discussion.

                That is why women aren't welcome in these matters.  It's like playing a sport while half your team refuses to accept theres even a game going on.  You are obviously white, too: no other races think race isn't important, because it hasn't been forcibly extirpated from their minds by Jewish brainwashing.  All Western nations venerate the other and denigrate white history and culture -- this logically can only be Hispanic immigrants' political influence or Jews, as it benefits them, so take a guess.

                Youve just proven it: A white woman today hears "white" and immediately associates it with HATRED AND AGGRESSION!

                 You are damaging a truth movement with your sexist and racist remarks.  Take them somewhere else.  This is supposed to be a discussion about science, and science doesn't give a flying fuck about gender or race or religion.

                  Right, that's why the govt has to encourage non-whites to donate organs because there's a huge shortage. Not only then is it a fact that race IS science and medicine, but race also seems to affect rates of ALTRIUSM -- or is there some socially conditioned reason blacks don't tick a box printed on the same drivers license form whites fill out?  LMAO.

                   Yeah man.  There's a humongous problem in organ trafficking.  That's why you're in the PG forum, right?
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   What if the elite literally grow humans just to test on.  Slaves used for many different purposes, whatever you train them to be, taking their organs just so they can live longer.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   Yeah, these people would lie to me about what I'm standing on and how far we can go up into the skies and down into the ground.

                   I just can't with 93 million miles away.  That's ridiculous.  And the moon 238,000 miles, and the atmosphere somehow magically causing perfect eclipses, even though one is supposedly 4 times bigger and 4 times further away.  🙄

                   Omg, yes, there are scientific differences between people.  DUH.

                  <p>
                   Would you like to discuss some of the evidence of Flat Earth?  Or are you a drama queen who feeds off negative energy, so you spread it like wildfire?
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   Or are you a CIA troll who needs to hide Flat Earth, so you're here to fill the thread with hatred and capital letters and sensitive subjects, therefore discouraging people to join the discussion and look at the evidence?

                  <p>
                   Flat Earthers are not the enemy.  The elite sicko pedophiles are, so stop letting them divide us.

                    I'm with you Rebekah, took me a while, but now I can't deny the truth. Extremely difficult to get anyone to even look into it. The very ones that think they're so redpilled. The truth is very liberating, an understatement. It started for me when I saw Zero Hedge commenters going at it, fighting. I thought it was the most ridiculous thing ever ... then you see that flat earthers are dead serious, and they're intelligent people.

                     Thanks bopper.  That's what frustrates me about my family.  They know I have intelligence.  I graduated with my bachelors with a 3.95 GPA.  But my family treats me like I'm insane.   It's like geez!  You know I'm smart!  Shut up and listen to some of the evidence!
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     I really take offense sometimes.  It's like they are calling me dumb.  They don't realize that I wouldn't believe it unless there was good evidence for it..
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     I just want them to try to prove the globe, because we all know what happens to people who actually try to debunk Flat earth ;)

                      You made me laugh. I know. It's funny, my son is an engineer at one of the biggest oil company's in the world. He keeps running into other engineers who are embracing it and I can tell he's getting flustered trying to prove them wrong. On Facebook. I have to let him discover it himself. I've already given my "presentation" to the family and it was a disaster. That's the only way it happens for people (open mind, discovering it themselves ... it's a beautiful thing when the light comes on). Eventually he will be worn down and fess up. I'm hoping. Man that is one Matrix that is hard to break out of. I look up now at the skies more than I ever have. In wonder.

                     Hi there.  That's cool one of the Don Quixote accounts hates you.  I like you already 🙋
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     Sounds like you've heard some about Flat Earth.  I've watched tons of stuff and could give you a list of YouTube channels I watch.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     I don't always agree with people, but I've seen so much evidence that I can look at and decide for myself.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     Really I think my mission is to tell NASA to STFU.  They have so been exposed as being full of shit. If you need that, I really like a channel called ThePottersClay.  I like the "A Flat Earth Picture is Worth a Thousand Words" section.  But exposing the ISS needs to be done if you haven't seen it.  Those people are not in orbit floating around.  It's wires and harnesses and green screen.  The hair on the women is usually just hair sprayed.  But it should flow around naturally in what we think is space, right?
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     Anyhoo, let me know if you need more suggestions, because I could write a list of channels I trust and why, and if I don't trust them, but watch them anyway, etc.  Whatever you do, stay away from Flat Earth Society.  They are only there to make us look dumb.
                    </p>

                     The same way Welch was only there to make PG researchers seem violent.

                       So good right?  I really like that channel.  :)
                      </p>
                      <p>
                       I think everyone learns differently, and it's hard to present the right video to friends and family sometimes.  But that's a good channel that people will actually watch with me.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                       I suggest Darren Nesbit too.   He has a channel called DazNez.  I don't agree with him on quite a few things, but he has some some great presentations.  It's hard to get this information out without sounding insane, but he does it quite well.  :)

                       Here's a good one.  It's kind of long, but for me personally, yes, I have time to ponder our home and our existence.

                      Thanks! I’ll check all that out. I’m glad you said that about the Flat earth society tho. They were lame. I’m questioning a lot of things tho because of what I’ve already learned. I never would have thought I would. But, if someone is willing to open their mind and try to forget what has been taught to them their whole lives, and research something and come up with their own opinion, I think that is great. It’s really hard to do.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                      I think of it like this... This place has opened a door for so many to see that we’ve been lied to by everyone. The deeper you dig, the more you see how big their lies really are. Even our American History books in school are full of lies. Evolution... lies. So why take the shape of the earth as fact by these very same people? I would rather open my mind to the possibilities and never trust what I’m told again. You’re right. NASA needs to STFU lol.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                      Thanks again. I look forward to checking all this out.

               The flat earth deception is the biggest and most easiest to prove. It makes all other 'conspiracie theories' like pizzagate easier to accept. We have all been collectively brainwashed for centuries. It's fascinatingly unbelievable.

               People have been saying science is a religion for a long time.  And we stereotyped the truthers as "mad scientists."

              <p>
               I also think it matters because the spinning globe is a tool for hypnosis.  I'm tired of hearing that subliminal programming doesn't effect people.  The globe is making all the other lies harder for people to see.

                 I love science.  I'm talking about "science."  Like the "science" NIST tried to sell about how Buikding 7 fell.
                </p>
                <p>
                 They told us bunk science, right?  And people believe them like it's a religion.  They refuse to hear other arguments, because they have faith in the mainstream "science," and can't fathom a world where the TV is lying to them.  Nah, they think, someone would have had a reality show about it by now.
                </p>
                <p>
                 "Science" is a religion.

            Well duh "Facebook" is censoring truth videos.  Otherwise we would have the truth much more often.
           </p>

            Like how Flat and motionless the land we are standing on is.  Spinning in space.  Pfffft

            If you are PG researchers, you should know that we are just trying to warn you of other satanic worshippers we happened to find while keeping a lookout.
           </p>
           <p>
            Stop treating Flat Earthers with disrespect before hearing what they have to say.  Because that's how victims are further victimized in this country.

           <p>
            Geez, we just wanted to talk about math and film and forensic evidence.

           <p>
            Go look at the space contraptions they said they landed on the moon in.  Honestly tell me you would let them pick you up 10 feet in that thing.
           </p>
           <p>
            The globe is a deception.  How do they hypnotize people?  With a circular pattern round and round, back and forth.  Sounds like a manual for how the torture and confuse victims.  Most likely PG victims.

             All I am saying is, the flat earth is really just a way of saying the world is no shape at all until we observe the photons which become particles and the physical manifestation of what would otherwise be, light waves.

              Yes, but that sounds like a theoretical hypothesis rather than something I can test and repeat.
             </p>
             <p>
              But I can observe and test the 100 mile long bridge in China, that should have 7000 feet of "curvature" in it, but it's flat, with flat beams, with no measurable curvature.  They can't tell you how they factored in the curve of the earth.  The architects will tell you that the blue prints assumed a flat plane below it.  Not a curving earth.

              a) I do agree with verifying all facts. You shouldn't even believe that the world is round if the government tells you it is until you verify it and think deeply about it yourself. That's a point that will be lost on many folks.
             </p>
             <p>
              b) This again, is another discussion that is not a good fit here, but I do not believe that a particle called a photon exists. Everything in the universe is a field. If this is a topic you're interested about Ken Wheeler on YouTube has hundreds of hours of discussions on magnetism, gravity, light, matter, etc.
             </p>
             <p>
              c) It's a little odd to respond from another account with no other posts, isn't it? That's the type of thing that might get one accused of being a shill.
             </p>
             <p>
              d) If you care about Pizzagate, this is the type of discussion that should go elsewhere on Voat IMO. Despite plenty of pedophile rings being discovered, normies have a hard enough time even conceptualizing this, let alone being able to consider other conspiracies.

               Just sayin, 1984 is hypnotizing you with that spinning globe.  Not sure if it kills you, but I don't think the effects are nominal or too small for our pea brains to see or comprehend.

               Thanks for your post and recommendations.  I am referring to the double slit experiment of course, Schroedinger was something of a Poet as well as a Physicist and he asked the most pertinent question of the millennia -  Do Electrons Think?
I think this is the most thought provoking question, with regards to the nature of our world

               As for the segregation of knowledge, it is completely at odds with the educational model of the new world order, in which the boundaries and compartmentalisation of subjects is removed and a single field of knowledge is developed upon, incorporating the whole spectrum of subjects, when required.

             While I don't believe in flat earth, I think flat earth theories need to be taken much more seriously as people are pointing things out about space, the moon landing, the ISS, and many other things that NASA lies to us about. That being said, I disagree with this post, and confess to down voting it. It's hard enough to get pizza gate taken seriously without dealing with flat earth and other conspiracy topics that instantly turn off normies and make it easy to make all of us look crazy.
            </p>
            <p>
             I'm not going to accuse you of being a shill because this post is great and I think your heart is in the right place, but if I was some deep state agency and wanted to shut down pizza gate discussion online, I'd start spamming their message boards with all kinds of flat earth, chem-trails, and other out there topics that would make them look like nuts to the vast majority of people who are not willing to open their minds up at all.
            </p>
            <p>
             PS: I would recommend looking into the concave earth theory. It's harder conceptually to wrap your head around, but explains much more about reality when you consider that light actually bends.

              I'm fine if people just get rid of NASA.  Unfortunately that means you have to get rid of cable, because no one hypnotizes people more with the spinning globe than TV.   Sports, politics, movies, everyone wants to use their millionth version of the spinning globe.  Hypnotization works best with a willing participant.  Stop inviting the vampire in your home.

               The first thing you see in every young kid's classroom is a globe. There definitely is some level of propaganda and manipulation at play here.

               It is is worth thinking about and discussing, I just think Pizzagate isn't the place for this type of thing.
