<blockquote>
<p>Michael Jackson \'was running most sophisticated paedophile operation world has known\' and \'sexually abusing kids all the way up until the day he died\', according to a lawsuit.
Lawyer Vince Finaldi - who is representing Jackson\'s latest accusers Wade Robson, 36, and James Safechuck, 40 - believes the star set up two companies as a front for \'luring\' children.</p>
<p>&quot;The thinly-veiled, covert second purpose of these business was to operate as a child sexual abuse operation, specifically designed to locate, attract, lure and seduce child sex abuse victims,&quot; the court documents published by The Sun read.
...
His dad took his own life when Robson was 20, because the allegations were &quot;a huge source of anxiety and depression,&quot; the legal papers claim.</p>

<p>-</p>
<p>I\'ve been saying this forever... Michael Jackson did NOT just molest a few kids. Michael Jackson ran a sophisticated child pornography and child trafficking ring - probably one of the biggest in the USA if not the world. </p>
<p>How interesting that Wade\'s father committed &quot;suicide,&quot; just like Jordie Chandler\'s father committed &quot;suicide.&quot; Move over Hillary Clinton, Michael Jackson is going to take your spot for &quot;most suicided&quot; victims of all time. Talking about Michael Jackson is Dangerous business. </p>
<p>People do not fucking realize how hard it is for victims to come forward, let alone for their story to be heard. By the time a kid is able to voice what happen to him, him and his family are already under 24 hour surveillance by a shady Private Investigator who knows everyone and everything about the kid and his family. Bring in the criminal elements like Anthony Pellicano who have access to wiretap families and FBI agents, and you have the recipe for no living man willing to tell on a serial pedophile like Michael Jackson. Pellicano was arrested in 2004 and is due to be released in late 2019. <strong>Michael Jackson\'s private investigator was not only was able to wiretap FBI investigators INVESTIGATING HIM</strong>, but also was in possession of C4 explosives. It does not take a Nobel Prize winner to see how Michael Jackson was able to silence those who spoke the truth - in some cases the silence is permanent.</p>
<p>I do not want to ever hear or read again that Michael Jackson was maybe a pedophile. There is no question. </p>
<p>It should also be of interest that fans and extended Jackson family members are making open threats towards Wade, including:</p>
<p><strong><em>&quot;so to be clear, W</em>de STILL has not been knocked out? nobodies shown him their hands? not a single one of y\'all. he\'s still walking around with face intact?&quot;</strong>*</p>
<p>I have saved screenshots but will not post them here <em>yet,</em> while they are being investigated by the proper authorities.
Never forget the &quot;suicide&quot; of Jordan Chandler\'s father in 2009. Jordy Chandler \'could not be found\' to testify in the Santa Barbara case. Amazing the coincidences and tragedies that befall Jackson\'s victims and their families.</p>

            Jackson was exposed as a way to divert attention on to him alone he was such a weird freak it was easy to expose him.
           </p>
           <p>
            The twist ending is he was found Not Guilty by a jury and he never went to prison. But he also never exposed any of the others. He could have brought down all of Hollywood and all of Motown the music biz if he wanted to.
           </p>
           <p>
            Same reason they threw Harvey Weinstein under the bus last year he was an easy fat soft target for the media to focus on.

            Michael Jackson was killed and replaced by a doppelganger between the albums "Off The Wall" and "Thriller" in this period the doppelganger did a few duets with Paul McCartney who himself was a doppelganger replacement - as were all The Beatles.
           </p>
           <p>
            One of the duets was called "Say Say Say". In Italian "sei sei sei" means "six six six" in the video the two doppelganger replaCIAments play a couple of con-artists

           </p>
           <p>
            I have no doubt the replacement was a pedo who lured children. This would have been well known to intel agencies and law enforcement and was probably used to control him and therefore his audience.

               Completely different skin tones. Nose does look different, but not messed up. JOSEPHXII - I think you may be right. Hopefully the real MJ can defend himself when the Hollyweird death fakers officially go public.

                He probably was killed when he was replaced. It's happened to dozens I know of already.

            Expect a flood of lawsuits from other victims that will forever tar Michael Jackson's reputation while opening the eyes of his rabid fans who denied the pop star's guilt to the last.
           </p>
           <p>
            Nope, there is No Maybe about it.  I agree.  Why is M Culkin so messed up?  The famous star is messed up too I imagine.  I hope to God a few of them speak out in detail.  As disgusting it will be to read and hear the details, this is what is needed to bring those stupid air head fans of his to their knees.  They perpetuated the pervert rapist all those years.  Little boys messed up all their lives.  Jackson took the easy way out.  Or they offed him.  Either way he got off without harming a hair, imo.

             I would not think it out of reality that the true number of victims of Michael Jackson is actually in the hundreds, if not thousands.
            </p>
            <p>
             There is much that cannot be written on a public forum without fear of reprisal. But I am confident all of it will come out soon enough. Just because Michael Jackson is dead, does not mean his legions of fellow conspirators are not trying to cover their asses.

              Yes, they want to protect their rears but also they want to keep raking in the cash.  He was a Monster Pedo.  I agree their are a huge number of Victims out there.  The number will be mind boggling when all is told.  They will be crawling out of the woodwork.  He had connections to two other pedos as well.  GL and SS.

             I really think pedophiles rally to his defense every time something critical is posted of him.

             They have 'fan club' webforums where they post links to articles and other forums so they can post their 'MJ is innocent! REEEEEEEEEEE!' bullshit.

            I believe every word of it. Jackson was groomed as a child star and learned how to take advantage of young kids seeking fame. They add another link to the pedo chain.

            Fuck off you pedophile apologist scum. This is not a forum for defending pedophiles like Michael Jackson. I have a hypothesis that the majority of people that defend Michael Jackson are pedophiles, is it true?

            You're right. Also take into account his conversion so islam. The Shekel Squad couldn't have liked that too much, given his amount of global influence. The tribe has every reason to slander MJ.

              I think I was more than fair in saying I don't know what happened. He very well could have groped a lot of kids.

              If you have a smoking gun, I'd love to see it. Maybe you're one of the kids he fucked?
