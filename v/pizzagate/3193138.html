<p>CRYSTAL LAKE, Ill. (AP) - Authorities searching for a missing 5-year-old Illinois boy who had lived in deplorable conditions dug up his body Wednesday and charged his parents with murder, sadly declaring that the youngster would &quot;no longer have to suffer.&quot;</p>
<p>The body, believed to be that of Andrew &quot;AJ&quot; Freund, was wrapped in plastic and buried in a shallow grave in a rural area of Woodstock in McHenry County, Crystal Lake police Chief James Black said.</p>
<p>Black said investigators went to the site after they interviewed the boy\'s parents overnight and presented them with cellphone evidence. Woodstock is about 50 miles (80 kilometers) northwest of Chicago and a few miles from the family\'s home in Crystal Lake.</p>

<p>&quot;This is not the outcome that we want to talk about ... but it is the unfortunate result,&quot; said Jeffrey Sallet, who runs the FBI in northern Illinois.</p>
<p>The parents, Andrew Freund Sr. and JoAnn Cunningham, each face charges of first-degree murder and other crimes. An email seeking comment was sent to Cunningham\'s lawyer. It wasn\'t immediately known if Freund has a lawyer.</p>
<p>The couple reported AJ missing last Thursday, telling officers they had last seen him at bedtime the previous night. Freund told a dispatcher that they\'d checked &quot;closets, the basement, the garage, everywhere,&quot; but investigators quickly knocked down the possibility of a kidnapping.</p>
<p>Speaking to reporters, Black had a message for AJ\'s relatives: &quot;It is my hope that you may have some solace in knowing that AJ is no longer suffering and his killers have been brought to justice.&quot;</p>
<p>Crystal Lake police had visited the house over the years, according to records released by the department. One report described the home as littered with dog feces and urine, including a child\'s bedroom where the &quot;smell of feces was overwhelming.&quot; Another report said the house was &quot;cluttered, dirty and in disrepair,&quot; and sometimes without electricity.</p>
<p>The Illinois Department of Children and Family Services, known as DCFS, had contact with the family since AJ was born with opiates in his body in 2013. The Northwest Herald said he was in foster care for two years before being returned to his parents. A younger brother was removed from the home last week.</p>
<p>Black said the cause of AJ\'s death remains under investigation. Police removed several items from the home, including a shovel, mattress, paper bags and a plastic storage tub.</p>
<p>&quot;We know you are at peace playing in heaven\'s playground and are happy you no longer have to suffer,&quot; the police chief said in a public message intended for the boy.</p>
<p>DCFS acting director Marc Smith said AJ\'s death was &quot;heartbreaking.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;After a nearly week-long search for missing Andrew &quot;A.J.” Freund, law enforcement officials today confirmed his death. This news is heartbreaking. Protecting vulnerable children who come to our attention is at the core of our mission at DCFS. All of us feel this loss. Our priority is the care and safety of Andrew’s younger sibling. We will continue to cooperate with law enforcement in their ongoing investigation. The Department is committed to conducting a comprehensive review of the entirety of our work with Andrew’s family to understand our shortcomings and to be fully transparent with the public on any steps we are taking to address the issues,&quot; Smith said in a written statement.</p>
<p>Gov. J.B. Pritzker in March ordered an independent review of DCFS after the deaths of a 2-year-old girl in Decatur and a 2-year-old boy in Chicago. Child welfare workers had contacts with both families.</p>
<p>State Sen. Julie Morrison, a Deerfield Democrat, immediately called for &quot;an independent, comprehensive audit of the DCFS hotline.&quot;</p>

<ol>
<li>Cunningham’s Mother, Lorelei Hughes, Filed a Petition Against Cunningham &amp; Andrew Sr., Accusing Them of Neglect</li>
</ol>
<p>In 2013, Cunningham’s mother, Lorelei Hughes, filed a petition for an order of protection for her grandson, Freund, accusing Cunningham and Andrew Sr. of neglecting him in the form of refusing to provide him medical care, food, and more.</p>
<p>In the document, which you can read above in full, Hughes maintained in part that Freund “was not provided food on a regular basis, eating a meal on approximately four of the seven days of the week and a remainder of the time there was no food int he house…the child was sent to school daily with no food and no money to purchase a lunch…there was no food in the residence and the child had only marshmallows and water to eat.”</p>
<ol>
<li>Freund Was Born With Opiates in His System; Family Services Had On &amp; Off Contact With the Freunds From 2013-2018</li>
</ol>
<p>The Illinois Department of Children and Family Services has a long history of visits with the Freunds. Last Tuesday, after filing a Freedom of Information Act, Crystal Lake Police acquired and then released five years of police reports on the Freunds. You can read them here, though much of it is redacted.</p>
<p>In total, protective services visited the Freund home 17 times over five years.  (Read the rest of what they found in the home) Disgusting.</p>
<ol>
<li>Cunningham’s Other, Younger Son Has Been Placed in Protective Custody</li>
</ol>
<p>The Freunds have another, younger son, whose named has not been released. The boy has since been placed in protective custody.</p>
<p>The Grandmother Lorelei also has custody of another son that was older than AJ.  She has done her part but also has been failed miserably by DCFS.  17 times they had contact with the family but here we have a Sweet Little Boy that was brutally murdered by his 2 parents. Tragic.</p>

<p>Letter - Prosecutor In Freund Case Has Complained About DCFS </p>
<p>WOODSTOCK, Ill. (AP) - Records show the prosecutor in the Illinois county where a 5-year-old boy\'s parents are charged in his death previously complained about the state\'s child welfare agency.</p>
<p>The Chicago Tribune reports McHenry County State\'s Attorney Patrick Kenneally wrote a letter to Illinois Department of Children and Family Services officials nearly a year ago. In the letter, Kenneally details three other separate cases in which he alleges caseworkers failed to act or were uncooperative with his office.</p>
<p>Kenneally\'s office last week charged Andrew &quot;AJ&quot; Freund\'s parents with murder in the boy\'s death. Records have shown DCFS interacted with the family since AJ was born. The Crystal Lake boy was found wrapped in plastic and buried in a shallow grave.</p>
<p>DCFS spokesman Jassen Strokosch says the agency has been meeting with prosecutors to address the issues and welcomes &quot;criticisms that help us do a better job.&quot;</p>

             I agree.  I am not a violent person.  Actually I used to be against the death penalty, but these two, I have no mercy for them.  DCFS and CPS are an abomination as well.

               I agree.  It's just all so sad.  Having to realize that his own parents did it I guess.  Yes, they deserve the worst punishment allowed really.  Reading how it happened and what they did, there should be no mercy shown.

                Right? The behavior issues they say he had are a result of their shit parenting, but they went ahead and took it all out on him. My blood boils.

                 Yes, that's what people do when they can't admit that they problems they have were created by they themselves.  Infuriating when it causes the death of a Child and so hard for us, people that Love Children so much, to understand.   It defies comprehension.

             I have been following this story, knew when I saw first article the parents were at fault
            </p>
            <p>
             Why do they choose one child?
            </p>
            <p>
             Got sick again, so trying to keep up
            </p>
            <p>
             Some days it's all I can do to check my news
            </p>
            <p>
             Carm, there are just too many children dying at the hands of people that are suppose to love them and take care of them
            </p>
            <p>
             My news feed is full of them, and in only a few cases, do they get serious time
            </p>
            <p>
             All this talk about immigrant children, when our children, born here, are being murdered left and right
            </p>
            <p>
             I'm not even talking about the missing ones
            </p>
            <p>
             When is a politician going to step up to the plate and fight for OUR children?
            </p>
            <p>
             When has it gotten to be ok to kill children?
            </p>
            <p>
             Where is the outcry?
            </p>

             Whether in the womb, or has been born, there is a crisis
            </p>
            <p>
             US children are being murdered every day, do we really need more children here when we can't even prevent ours from dying?
            </p>
            <p>
             You would think that the one thing that would bring everyone together would be the children

              children seem to lack a voice.  This similar situation happened right here.  It was that one child who got the abuse.

              I could not have said it better, that's why I called on you.  The politicians want us to focus on other Children, so we take our eyes off of ours.  Yes, there are Children being killed everyday.  Dying from abortions, by the hands of pedophiles and parents, and just from total carelessness.  It sickens me, as I know it sickens you.  My feeling is that DCFS and CPS are causing much of the deaths due to foster care placement.  We know all too well what the problems are  As far as choosing one child, I believe the drugs had taken hold to the point of no return.  Also she was pregnant with another baby.  Anger and frustration about how they would care for another Child surely added to the problems.  I am not excusing either one of them in any way.  But just trying to find an answer myself.  I am hoping with all my heart that in some way they find a way to get the older boy that is with his Grandmother, together with the younger boy and to add their dog to the mix.  There should be a way to help that Grandma have both of those boys.  There is money.  There is so much waste in that dept.  RIP AJ +

                The govt. plays a big part, and imo it is on purpose.  This was their plan.  Also the opioids from Big Pharma have been passed out like candy.  An easy fix they tell them.  Then they are hooked for life.  Idk how we can stop the merry go round.  One thing at a time.  It took a long time getting here.  Sadly many will die until fixed.  It's sad yes.  I agree that increasing sentences would help. Many would think twice before committing the crimes.  It's a start.  You and I have done research and posting on this before.  Tired of it yes, but we have to keep going.  TPTB would love for us to hang it up.

            Newly Released Documents Reveal GRAPHIC DETAILS About AJ Freund Case
           </p>
           <p>
            **WARNING: Documents contain graphic and disturbing details.   Click and View Gallery  There are 10 Images

           <p>
            CRYSTAL LAKE, Ill. — In newly released documents from court records, McHenry County detectives detailed the findings of their investigation into the Andrew “AJ” Freund case.
           </p>
           <p>
            The 5-year-old’s parents, Andrew “Drew” Freund and JoAnn Cunningham were charged with his murder. A few days after AJ was reported missing on April 18, investigators suspected foul play.
           </p>
           <p>
            After K-9s soon established that AJ did not leave his Crystal Lake home, the focus turned to his parents in the days and hours leading up to his disappearance. Already well-known to the Department of Child and Family Services for reported cases of abuse, cases that were found by DCFS to be unfounded, police found the home to be dirty and in a hoarder-like condition.
           </p>
           <p>
            Their story began to unravel when Drew Freund consented to a search of his cellphone in the early morning hours of April 15. It was then that investigators learned there was a Google search for “Child CPR” on April 15.
           </p>
           <p>
            They also found a picture of a shopping list that was taken on April 17. According to the documents, several items of note on the shopping list were duct tape, plastic gloves, air freshener and bleach. The items were purchased at the local Jewel-Osco.
           </p>
           <p>
            In the home, police found laundry that smelled of bleach and at least four bleach bottles. They also found Drew Freund’s gym shoes with dripping wet mud.
           </p>
           <p>
            Under questioning from detectives, the couple tried to explain away the shopping list. They said tape was going to be used for hanging pictures. The bleach was to clean the premises — they said they went through at least one bottle a week. Detectives were skeptical of that information.
           </p>
           <p>
            In regard to the CPR search in the middle of the night, Drew Freund said perhaps Cunningham was searching CPR for babies in anticipation of her future child. Cunningham is seven months pregnant. In addition to AJ, she is also the mother of his brother, 4-year-old Parker.
           </p>
           <p>
            Days later on April 23, With the help of the FBI, investigators were able to recover a deleted video on Cunningham’s cellphone and a two-minute video of her berating AJ for urinating on his bed. In the video, AJ can be seen naked except for a few bandages around his wrists and hips.
           </p>
           <p>
            Drew Freund told investigators that Cunningham believed AJ had “oppositional defiance disorder or ODD and AJ thinks of himself as the leader of the home and is therefore defiant to his parents, lies, disobeys and thinks things should go his way.”
           </p>
           <p>
            He went on to detail how AJ, for example, would be punished for improperly washing and stacking dishes and lying.
           </p>
           <p>
            Under mounting evidence, the couple confessed to the murder on the morning of April 24 and admitted that on April 15, AJ had lied about soiled underwear so he was subjected to a cold shower for about 20 minutes. After putting him to bed, Cunningham checked on AJ sometime later where she discovered he had died.
           </p>
           <p>
            Drew Freund said, “the next day he took AJ’s body to the basement and stored him in a tote. He said on 4/17/19 he placed AJ inside several trash bags, placed the body in the trunk of his car and drove him in an area in Woodstock.”
           </p>
           <p>
            He allegedly dug a shallow grave and placed the child in it and covered it with straw and left.
           </p>
           <p>
            Both parents agreed to let the state’s child welfare agency care for their younger son.
           </p>
           <p>
            FYI - There is also an older son that Grandma Lorelei is already caring for.  No word as to whom the father is.  All together Joann Cunningham will have given birth to 4 Children after she has the one she is carrying now.  She is 7 mos. pregnant.  They are giving Andrew Freund a paternity test to verify if he is the father.  This is beyond anything my mind can process.   Extremely hard for me right now.

              Wash this the older son, that is living with the Grandmother?  I never dream, but I had to toss and turn quite a bit the night I posted it.  So upsetting.  After what I have been through I did not want to post.  But the DCFS aspect drove me to do it.  I wanted it put out there.  17 visits and they found nothing wrong?  Something must change and NOW.
