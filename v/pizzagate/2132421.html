            What? No... I'm arguing the validity of this topic, in this thread. I never claimed Julian has direct evidence of pedo activities. But I do believe that we will find a link within the PG/Russian developments. Both are related informational warfare... involving hidden communications, with overlapping perpetrators in some cases.

            All of these leaks hit around the same time... they've condemned false sources, went heavy on the anti-PR for all of the leaks (Russia and Pizzagate being the most fervent), questioned the validity, escaped any conviction despite the content itself and a "full" FBI investigation.
           </p>
           <p>
            Anything "leak" related that implicates some of the overlapped perpetrators in both PizzaGate and/or RussiaGate should be on the table.

            POTUS Trump would be a hero if he pardons Assange. Look at the hero that fraud anti-American Obama is for pardoning that it traitor Brad Chelsea Manning. Trump should definitely pardon Assange and give him the best security possible.

            , you rock for sharing such good news on a Friday night.  I, for one, would be a-okay with President Trump pardoning Julian Arrange.  I'd also love to see Assange given a good ole Green Card and a pathway to citizenship so that he and his kitty cat can get the Hell out of that embassy.
           </p>
           <p>
            Not only can Assange clear up the DemocRATS' Russia bullshit, once and for all, but he could also rip the bloody lid off the Seth Rich murder "mystery."   If it is what we all think it is, then those filthy murderers would be busted.
           </p>
           <p>
            Never forget, people, that Assange risked his life in exposing the Clinton Crime Family.  Hillary wanted to drone the guy years ago.  He's a national hero for posting the truth about the psychopaths who govern us.
           </p>
           <p>
            So having said all that, LET THE PARDON RIP.

            If the FBI &amp; DOJ (not compromised like Comey, Mueller, McCabe) does not talk to Assange and obtain the best evidence in a case of this magnitude involving a potential murder of American citizen for political assasination it is a complete abdication of their duties. They are required to get best evidence. The very fact Mueller has not contacted Wikileaks attorney's and Kimdotcom attorney's as of yet is a disgrace.

              Isn't Mueller supposedly investigating Russian interference in the 2016 Presidential election? Isn't the main "interference" the release of the DNC &amp; Podesta emails? Why the hell wouldn't he question the leader of Wikileaks, who disseminated the emails?
             </p>
             <p>
              Let me correct myself, it's only the DNC emails in question. The DNI report never actually mentions the Podesta emails. They just conflate the two incidences to make the public think Russia hacked Podesta.

               The Russians spearfished Podesta which is a different type of cyber attack.  The spearfishing operation that targeted Podesta targeted over 4,000 people worldwide.  Colin Powell was spearfished, here's the spearfishing email that a member of the Clinton campaign received.  These spearfishing emails were customized and targeted to specific individuals.

               Well before the DNC emails were released, the Russians created the DCLeaks domain.  The malware servers used in these hacking campaign also hacked the German Parliament, NATO, Polish government officials, etc and had been previously tied to Russian intelligence.  The State Board of Elections systems were targeted in at least 20 states, including Arizona and Illinois.  A company that makes voting machine software was hacked as part of this same campaign.  Later these same hackers were behind Macron Leaks.  In fact these hacking teams have been known to researched for at least a decade before the DNC announced they were targeted by them.  Researchers know them as Advanced Persistent Threat 28 and 29.

               I'm sure Mueller would love to have Assange in front of a grand jury where Assange would be under oath under penalty of perjury, but this is not what Assange is offering.

              <blockquote>

                Isn't the main "interference" the release of the DNC &amp; Podesta emails?
               </p>
              </blockquote>
              <p>
               I would argue this is not the main interference.  I would say manipulation and influence campaigns on social media including bots and targeted dark ads were the main interference.  The Podesta/DNC emails were a subset of this.  A data researcher found some interesting things when looking at the key words used on Reddit's thedonald forum.  Words like Clinton or Trump would be used at the same rate all throughout the day.  The words Podesta and Wikileaks were not used at the same rate.  They were used at much higher rates during working hours for the St. Petersburg time zone.  They would rise at the same time month after month and then quickly fall off at the same time month after month.
              </p>
              <p>
               As for what Wikileaks knows.  Wikileaks has said their system to upload a leak is completely anonymous even to them.  It would not be difficult at all for Russia (or any other intelligence agency) to simply upload a hack from a cyber cafe in a in a different country and use other methods to hide their tracks.
              </p>
              <p>
               Also we have arrested a few Russian hackers in recent months and are trying to expedite them to the US.  A Ukrainian author of malware and hacking tools is cooperating with the FBI.  I would guess Mueller is far more interesting in learning about them Julian Assange's lawyer and Kimdotocom.

               Russia &amp; Racism have been their "ping pong" conflation match since September of 2016. Think about the power it has? I'm not being sarcastic... people literally believe that
               <strong>
                all Trump supporters
               </strong>
               are racist and supporting a Russian employee as our POTUS.
              </p>
              <p>
               I'll repeat. They believe that. And it has an impact, as they are their politician's constituents.

                Question for you.  What do you make of the extraordinary number of contacts between the Trump family and ex-Soviet countries, the Trump Organization and ex-Soviet Countries and the Trump Campaign and ex-Soviet countries.
               </p>
               <p>
                The reason I say ex-Soviet is Ukraine is a giant, giant part of Trump's dealings as is Kazakhstan. I'll get to this in a bit.
               </p>
               <p>
                But Trump has made a number of surprising personnel decisions.  Carter Page, an unknown was named a foreign policy expert,  Paul Manafort who hadn't worked in American politics in 20 years took over as campaign manager, Rex Tillerson an oil executive was named Secretary of State.  The common denominator between these men is Russia.  Page was known the FBI for years who in 2013 warned him the Russians he was dealing with were spies and were attempting to recruit him.  Manafort worked for the Pro Russian Ukranian kleptocrat Yanukovych who stole millions from Ukraine.  Tillerson didn't even donate to Trump's campaign, but all of sudden he was Secretary of State?  What were his credentials was a director at US/Russian company Exxon Neftegas and was awarded Russian Order of Friendship medal.
               </p>
               <p>
                The most powerful gangster in the "Russian Mob" is Semion Mogilevich who is actually Ukrainian.  He helped set up the Russian mob in New York City.  The two areas most associated with the Russian Mob in the US is Brighton Beach, Brooklyn, a Russian Neighborhood known as little Odessa and Trump Tower, which has been the home to surprising number of Russian Criminals and crime schemes. The third place might be Atlantic City.  Nowadays the fourth place is in Florida.
               </p>
               <p>
                Felix Sater, the convicted felon who worked at the Trump organization is said to part of Mogilevich's crime family, his father is said by the FBI to a soldier for Mogelevich.  We do know that Sater worked on the Trump Soho project as Felix Satter, we know Trump publicly cut ties with him when the NY Times in 2007 revealed he was really Felix Sater and was convicted of assault and $40 million dollar stock fraud, we know that later Sater was working in Trump Organization with his own Trump business cards, we know that Sater and Trump's lawyer Michael Cohen worked on deal to lift Sanctions they delivered this January to NSA Michael Flynn and we just found Trump was working on building a tower in Moscow and Sater was part of it and the funding was going to be from a Russian government bank.

                 That all sounds very damning... my question back to you is this:
                </p>
                <p>
                 <strong>
                  When the tiniest details of potential collusion pop up, it becomes a media circus. If the ties are this strong and direct... where is the perpetual CNN coverage?
                 </strong>
                </p>
                <p>
                 One possible reason: The MSM is fully aware that the public is dealing w/ "Russia Fatigue"... people were getting sick of hearing about it. So, they stay quiet until it is time to drop the hammer.
                </p>
                <p>
                 My official answer:
                 <strong>
                  Even if there is dead-to-rights evidence against Trump re: Russia.
                 </strong>
                 Outside of the implication of Seth Rich/Russian "hacks" we currently assume are being covered up... it takes none of the significance away from what was discovered to date re: PizzaGate, Podesta Leaks, Awan/DNC/Congress, Unmasking, Clinton's email server, etc...
                </p>
                <p>
                 If your scenario is true, "both sides share blame".

                  Just before you seemed to dismissing the Russian investigation, not as a real issue.  That this did not come organically, but that some forces were behind it, that the "Fix was in" and the media was in on it.   After I laid out for you, just some of many, many, many Trump connections to Russia and why legitimate questions are being raised.  You don't actually want to explore them at all.  You give it a cursory dismissal and then turn back to a classic case of Whattaboutism.
                  <br/>
                  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whataboutism">
                   https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whataboutism
                  </a>
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  Whattaboutism was very popular in the Soviet Union.  They didn't want to defend their human rights records, so they would try to dismiss it and create a false moral equivalence.  One common phrase they used if criticized by America, was "What about the lynching of Negros?"
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  You also seem to have a contradiction in your argument, you claim that the tiniest detail of collusion becomes a media circus, but that the media is also staying quiet.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  I also completely disagree with your conclusion.  "If your scenario is true, "both sides share blame."  Share blame makes it sound like they are both in on the same things together.  I think what you are saying is both sides have marks against them.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  But I completely disagree that there would be a balance.
                  <br/>
                  Clinton's email's has already been investigated.  Other than that what do you have?
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  You have Awan. Do you know what the one charge Awan faces is?
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  Unmasking, was always basically a fake scandal churned up to create some sort of talking point Trump fans could use during the Russia scandal and to support Trump's lie that Obama wiretapped him and it has already fallen completely apart.
                  <br/>
                  Why was this fake?  Susan Rice doesn't have the authority to unmask anyone.  She has to request it and has to have a legitimate reason for this.  This is why folks on the Intel committees and the National Security Advisor have said she did nothing wrong.   Why did it fall apart?  Because we now know what she asked to be unmasked.  The crown prince of the United Arab Emirates tried to secretly enter the country.  She was trying to figure out why.  Normal procedure is to alert us when high level government officials are coming into the country.  Could you imagine what would happen if there was some security incident involving him on American Soil.  Well it turned out he was having a secret meeting with Trump folks.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  So the question is why was this secret?  And does it relate to this meeting
                 </p>
                 <blockquote>
                  <p>
                   Blackwater founder held secret Seychelles meeting to establish Trump-Putin back channel
The United Arab Emirates arranged a secret meeting in January between Blackwater founder Erik Prince and a Russian close to President Vladi­mir Putin as part of an apparent effort to establish a back-channel line of communication between Moscow and President-elect Donald Trump, according to U.S., European and Arab officials.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   The meeting took place around Jan. 11 — nine days before Trump’s inauguration — in the Seychelles islands in the Indian Ocean, officials said.

                  Prince has admitted to this meeting, but he said it was incidental?   Incidental?  He just happened to be in the Seychelles Islands?
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  If you were flying commercially, it would be 36 hours because you have to flight in UAE first and then have an 18 hour layover in Dubai.  Seems like plenty of time to meet with someone from the UAE.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  Of course, there's zero evidence of any crime from the Podesta Leaks/Pizzagate.  People can't even tell me what probable cause is. The quality of evidence is like one time several years ago, a man made a videotape of Comet Ping Pong and somewhere on the sidewalk a child was screaming. Contrast that with the genuine Trump Russia investigation  where there are multiple grand juries hearing evidence and warrants have been served.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  People keep saying the Russia thing is fake or made up or debunked and it keeps getting more and more serious.  The White House Counsel even had to hire a lawyer.

              Not Robracher.....I know Mueller &amp; McCabe &amp; Comey are. But they have a dilemma they cannot refuse to engage in best evidence which is a live witness ecspecially regarding national security and a potential political assasination. Trump can offer the pardon and Julian can come testify. This is outside the FBI if it has to be. This is why it should be in open public so trust in rule of law can be re-established. Let the sunshine in and the cockroaches scatter.
