<p>That is very interesting! There have been a few posts here lately saying covfefe is the password that unlocks Jimmy comets basement.</p>
<p>Then we have individuals claiming they own Jimmy\'s bases and they have posted some of it on the web and they used tinypics.</p>

<p>Looks like she just changed her screen name recently... She also references &quot;member berries&quot; under the screen name, which is a South Park reference from last season.</p>

<p>Hi Guys,</p>
<p>OK, I know this is little bit unexpected but I have obviously been lurking for quite some time but for reasons which are quite urgent, I have made this post.</p>
<p>Last night out of the blue I received a phone call from one Trey Parker who works with Matt Stone on the comedy network hit South Park. Some of you might be aware his father is a geologist, this is significant.</p>
<p>So Trey tells me they were thinking of including me on the show in a story line involving the return of Chef, George Lucas and Steven Spielberg. The episode was to be called Twilight Zone and my character was to be something along the lines of Carrie, which I didn\'t quite get until Trey brought up pizza gate.</p>
<p>What he revealed to me, is fundamentally going to change the way we all live our lives from this day forth.</p>
<p>I\'m sharing it now South Park told us that Speilberg was a Pederast <a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1720469">https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1720469</a></p>
<p>Download it, distribute it.</p>

            Fair point on keeping it all here, I just thought I was taking the topic off-track too much. If the mods think like you have, they'll be sure to delete my post and I'll have no problem with that.

            I've seen that statue before, I think it's in this video. You need to watch it if you haven't, this guy's a fucking nutter...

            Yeah, it's at 37 minutes. Actually, those pictures you linked are from that video, no doubt about it.
           </p>
           <p>
            As to your other post, I don't know about links with "ale" but I guess it's fair to say that after a few beverages a man can change. And who knows what they put in their grog back in the days of the sails.
           </p>
           <p>
            Another interesting thing is "pay lay ale". Ever heard of that? I've been meaning for a while to collar a pair of Missionaries to ask them about that.

            I'm about to start a new thread on this, I think I hit on something which needs to be looked at.
           </p>
           <p>
            The thing about Baphomet is that he could potentially be likened to Yael who I think was some sort of "goat god". The yael is actually a type of goat, or should I say ibex. Both "yael" and "ibex" when put into Google Translate (which is specifically what I use alongside Wiktionary) are both translated into Hebrew as the exact same word (possibly with vocal differences but the glyphs are the same). The odd thing is that "yael" sounds extremely similar to "aisle". Then there is the Hebrew word איל which is a word for "ram" and also one of many Hebrew words for "God" (with the latter sense probably being equivalent to the word "El").
           </p>
           <p>
            Now I'm pretty sure there's a gate or arch or something around Buckingham Palace which has an ornamental piece attached to it which is pretty much an ibex, thus probably being something to do with Yael. Oh wait, so the "yale" is actually the thing I'm talking about... yes, there's one of those things somewhere around the palace which makes one wonder.

            I don't think Yiddish is the best way to translate stuff, it's way too phonetically-related to English. I mean, compare the words for planets between Hebrew and Yiddish and you'll see that they're essentially two completely different languages. In other words, use Hebrew or, better still, Aramaic.
           </p>
           <p>
            "Cov" could mean "inside", which could be in a box or possibly a woman (in a manner of speaking). Consider the word "covert", which I suppose could relate to "inward", whereas "overt" would be "outward".
           </p>
           <p>
            As for "fe", well a "f" in Hebrew is the same letter as a "p" so it's tricky. I've seen translations relating to both the foot and the mouth, which leads me to believe that by using the word twice, along with "inside" could thus be an allegory for "putting one's foot in one's mouth". Suffice to say, the media tend to do that quite a lot. I think either way we could strike a resemblance between this theory and the Yiddish one because both relate to a futile exercise.
           </p>
           <p>
            As to the Hebrew word for butterfly, it is actually the same as "bull" written twice. I don't know if there's a link to the bull, if there is then it could be somebody decided that a yoke resembles a butterfly. For clarity, a "yoke" is an "aisle", a yoke is placed over the shoulders of a pair of oxen used for ploughing, aisle is also a word for "wing" and the shoulder of an animal could be described as its wing. Run a Google Images search for "yoke" and you'll possibly notice that it could indeed vaguely resemble a butterfly.
           </p>
           <p>
            Also, "covfefe" is very slightly similar to habibi (חביבי), which means "buddy" or "darling" in Hebrew and Arabic and is related to the word for "likeable". Not that this seems to be relevant in any way, but the written words seem similar enough to me.
           </p>
           <p>
            Oh, and since "fe" can also mean "play"... it could refer to "inside jokes". Another concept could be "in play" and with Trump being a businessman it could refer to the stock market or at least be an analogy of stock being in play. This latter idea is actually worth considering because if stock is in play then it is likely the subject of news and possibly rumours; in the sense of politically-sensitive topics, it could thus relate to newsworthy matters which solicit rumours and catchy headlines.
           </p>
           <p>
            That is to say, the media publish inflammatory stuff about the president and he likens it to playing big money on the stock game... and losing. So what this means is that if somebody gambles on stock and loses, then I guess they were so foolish as to do such a pointless thing as putting their foot in their mouth. I think he deliberately used the word in his tweet and has since decided to keep quiet about its true meaning just to troll the entire world.
           </p>
           <p>
            Yet another possibility is that it could be related to the word letter "kappa". This Greek letter is equal to the 11th letter of the Hebrew alphabet and is loosely pronounced as "cof" or "kuf" or similar. Now pronounce the other parts of "kappa"... "pe" or "fa" or similar. So you have a word that is very similar to "cof-fe-fe" when broken down. Interesting, huh? Therefore, this leads to a further idea that it means "CPP".
           </p>
           <p>
            Now how's about that for a rabbit hole?

to a great extent; very much. Meaning seeing is believing, seeing is believing to a greater extent if cnn tells you what you're seeing should be believed.

            James Alefantis produced this movie. I guess many at Sundance thought it was "wonderful". Whatever, creeps. Anyway, some think the band Sun Araw is really...Sun Ra. (Or backwards, raw anus).

                etc., they are wasting our time. Just hover over their names they are almost all on voat within the past few days!  Elites globalist are getting worried, their willing servants are out in full swing........but......it won't help, their money is down the drain and EXPOSURE is about to have the LIGHT shine on their evil deeds and children will be saved!  Time for us to ignore these annoying fleas trying to suck our energy.

              Stone of Heaven is a European translation of the term Lapsit Exillus, closely related to Lapis Elixir, an appellation used by the Sufis that denoted, “Philosopher’s Stone.” Lapsit derived from “stone” and related to the Latin lapsus, meaning fallen, thus denoting “fallen stone.” Since the term Exillus is related to exillis stellis, meaning : “from the stars,” the entire moniker Lapsit Exillus literally translates as “The Stone of the Heavens” or “The Stone which came down from the Stars.”
The name Stone of Heaven can also be derived from the word Grail. The term Grail derived from the French gres or Persian gohr, both denoting a stone. Grail of Greal could also be related to the French grele, meaning hailstone, which is a “stone” from heaven.
According to Arthur Edward Waite, the term Lapsit Exillus is “Exiles Stone.” This surprisingly affiliates the Stone of heaven with Heaven’s most notorious exile, Lucifer.

            The "elites" don't Tweet significant info to each other.  Anything the masses/sheeple read in a Tweet was put there intentionally for their consumption.  IOW, it's bullshit!
