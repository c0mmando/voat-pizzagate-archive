            subtitles are written by random people in developing countries for 50 cents.. it says shot not chalk.. and all the words are written incorrectly. It's someone that barely knows how to write english.. Again, this is what I said about 70% of 'research' being mildly schizophrenic people trying to see things everywhere.. No offense, but it's clear it's an nothing.

            I am trying to FUCK my wifeâ€™s little sister, Sabrina. She is retarded. She is 11 but the IQ of a 5 year old and has down syndrome. It has allowed me to French kiss her a bunch of times. I have felt her breast(nice C CUP TITS TO BOAST) and have rubbed her ass while Frenching her . NICE CURVES. I have also felt her soft PUSSY FUR and I have put part of my finger in her, but her camel toe is small and tight. . We are going to be alone this weekend for about 5 hours. I want her pussy so bad. I know she is so tight and I would ROCK her world. Any ideas? I really WANT THIS. NEED HER PUSSY BAD. I will use lube as well because I don't want to hurt her too badly. Thanks Family Have a blessed day PS I promise NOT to get her pregnant!!! I JUST KNOW HER SLIT is SO TIGHT AND SMALL!! Can't wait to see the look in her eyes, the moment I POP HER! WOW!\ This is what love is all about. I explained about making LOVE and how important it is. She has not had love made to her so I have a chance to pop a cherry. I told her that making love is important and she will die before she is 21 if she does not have loved made to her. She is scared and does not want to die. I told her, that if I can make love to hear and keep it a secret she will be fine. I think I got her hook line and sinker! Caring and SHARING while we suffer the burden of taking care of these rejects. God Bless you all
