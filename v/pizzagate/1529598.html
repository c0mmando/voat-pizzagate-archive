<h2>Alefantis is GREAT friends with Michael Maccoby whose son is a Director of Friends of the Orphans, the charity Laura Silsby was given children from</h2>
<h2><a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1525811">UPDATE</a>: Max Maccoby, Director of Friends of the Orphans, also represented James Alefantis and David Brock for the $850,000 blackmail case</h2>
<p>TL;DR:</p>
<ul>
<li>Alefantis is GREAT friends with Michael Maccoby, whose son is on the Board of Directors for Haitian orphanage, Friends of Orphans</li>
<li>Laura Silsby, convicted child-trafficker got her children from Friends of Orphans, according to an interview with her lawyer Jorge Puello (wanted child-trafficker) <a href="https://archive.fo/ox7Fa#selection-423.0-425.82">https://archive.fo/ox7Fa#selection-423.0-425.82</a></li>
</ul>
<hr />
<p>Okay, so we all know about the &quot;crazy&quot; neighborhood commissioner, Frank Winstead.</p>
<p>If you download and listen to the audio recordings for the meeting about Comet Ping Pong operating post-midnight, the one where Frank Winstead called out Alefantis for potentially soliciting &quot;rapes and murders&quot;, there\'s a man that stands up to threaten Frank Winstead to say &quot;I will personally take anyone who opposes this down&quot; (31:40).</p>
<hr />

<p>Audio recordings: <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/mitalgandhi/anc3fmeeting">https://sites.google.com/site/mitalgandhi/anc3fmeeting</a> (filename ends with COMET, speech is at 31:40. - this link is safe, it\'s directly linked from the article above)</p>
<hr />
<p>His name is Michael Maccoby, and he\'s the head of the Maccoby Group. We know this because he said his address, &quot;4825 Linnean Ave&quot;, which is the exact same address as the one listed on the Maccoby Group website. He\'s the father of Izette Folger (very close friends with Alefantis, also on the board for Transformer DC), Nora Maccoby and Max Maccoby. He lives very close to Comet Ping Pong, and it\'s a wonder why this man was so vehement about Comet Ping Pong operating after midnight.</p>
<p>Apart from being part of an elite Washington club, Cosmos Club, there was one thing that struck me as weird in this guys biography. He coaches leaders at Nuestros Pequeños Hermanos, homes for orphaned and abandoned children, an orphanage in Mexico, Honduras, Haiti, Nicaragua, Guatemala, ElSalvador, the Dominican Republic, Bolivia and Peru. So here we have Haiti again.</p>

<p>So ... according to the Independent, there are 760 orphanages in Haiti. What would be the likelihood, that Jorge Puello, a wanted child-trafficker, who pretended to be a lawyer to defend another child-trafficker (Laura Silsby), be connected to the Friends of the Orphans? Remember: there are 760 orphanages in Haiti.</p>
<p>Well look at the Jorge Puello interview with Fox News, in February 2010. Turns out, he knows a lot about &quot;Friends of the Orphans&quot;.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>VAN SUSTEREN: Where did they find these 33 children? How did they get these children? <a href="https://archive.fo/ox7Fa#selection-423.0-425.82">https://archive.fo/ox7Fa#selection-423.0-425.82</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Mr. Puello is wanted by the police in at least four countries in connection with charges including sex trafficking of girls and women, and making counterfeit documents and violating parole. <a href="http://archive.is/Natq5#selection-1987.0-1987.189">http://archive.is/Natq5#selection-1987.0-1987.189</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>So, here you go. We all know how close the Maccoby\'s are with Alefantis. So what business, did Laura Silsby, a convicted child-trafficker, have with Friends of the Orphans, directed by Max Maccoby?</p>

            this is obvious shilling at its best (worst?). look at this user's other comments. he even uses the phrase "warm, family friendly restaurant" repeatedly.

            you aren't fooling anyone. If Alefantis and everyone else is in fact innocent, they have nothing to fear - the point is that the amount of circumstantial evidence is mountainous at this point, and we are not going to rest until there is a legitimate investigation into these activities and the individuals allegedly involved.

            My main problem/question with this is that Laura Silsby is accused of lying about the collapsed orphanage.  In that Fox interview Puello says the children came from a collapsed orphanage but other sources say that after an investigation the children were found to have been given away by their parents (they didn't come from an orphanage).

            &lt;- This document goes over the Silsby thing really well and also says that the children were being handed over by their family members.  That was kind of the big deal with Silsby is that she seemed to be lying about where the children were coming from and she was negligent with the paperwork.

            There are more same-sex couples in DC than anywhere and I suspect that it's easy for them to adopt as the local DC jurisdiction is free from US regulations.
           </p>
           <p>
            I suspect that the kids they adopt are the same sex as the parents and these families live in clusters. Like a villiage, and the kids are passed around.

            Well look at the Jorge Puello interview with Fox News, in February 2010. Turns out, he knows a lot about "Friends of the Orphans".

            Just wanted to point out that Annie Maccoby Berglof is associated with Robert Shapiro. He would be one of the guys from George Webb's YT vids. Not sure of the entire relationship but it just seems all these people are incestuously intertwined.  Shapiro was contacted by Chris Stevens from Benghazi. That's in GW's vids too. So basically you have a circle that ties Alefantis to Hillary, Maccoby, Shapiro, Stevens. How bizarre.

             This could be way off, but I remember reading that Robert Shapiro was identified specifically by one of the victims of Jeffrey Epstein's underage sex island.  I just assumed it was the Robert Shapiro from the OJ case.  But is it possible that it was this guy?

              I needed to edit that prior comment to clarify he was not the same guy as the one in GW's videos, but he could certainly be the one you mention. He obviously has all of the connections. Do you know where you read that?

               Sorry, my mistake.  I did a quick search and it turns out it wasn't Robert Shapiro, it was Alan Dershowitz (OJ's other lawyer).

                Oh yes, I remember that. I honestly thought I had missed that bc there were a bunch of people listed who had visited Lolita island. Certainly remember Dershowitz. And I could totally see that too.

            does it mean anything? don't think it's anything we can follow - but i'm convinced that's it, and it was sketchy before silsby had access to it.

               Read this blog, it's written by someone who met Silsby personally (and also spoke of how suss she was):
               <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100403060948/http://www.haitivoxbulletin.com/2010/02/special-report-puello-says-other.html">

               </a>
              </p>
              <p>
               It mentions that Jose Hidalgo was the realtor from Dominica assisting Silsby. I recall reading somewhere else that one of these two were Silsby's partners. So I found Jose Hidalgo's social page and it had this.

                Yep.   It mentions the SOS children's village, that's in haiti, and where the kids were brought by authorities.
               </p>
               <p>
                It also mentions a brochure carried by silsby, showing a resort with a pool...that's what i want to see a connection for...I'm of the opinion that it was dreem, but i can't find the connection from puello or hidalgo to dreem.

            yes, the meeting/tour was with several hundred people, and yes it displays as a generic tour, but obama's schedule puts the two in the same place on the same day, with overlapping windows.

             In regards to the Silsby mission to Haiti, is it the understanding that the people she went there with were innocent missionaries being used by Silsby as a front? If so, they should be speaking out at this point.

              Being a mod doesn't give us special powers to collect info on users.  It just lets us flair posts, remove posts, and edit the sidebar, etc.
