Does anyone else think that something is odd here? A wealthy friend of a pedophile can produce a child no questions asked? Mr. Zuckerman is so elevated that he can hit and run a car and leave the scene and get no citation.http://nypost.com/2013/09/09/billionaire-zuckerman-totals-single-moms-car/. Some reports put out the info that he paid a surrogate. This is a man apparently above public scrutiny even with a history of pedophile friends.</p>',

              How many of those teenage girls had unprotected sex with Epstein? How many came up pregnant? How many had to divest themselves of their children (or were pressured to) to billionaires that wanted a child but didn't want the trouble to have the mother(witness)  around?
