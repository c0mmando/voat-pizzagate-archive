           WOW....It's on a facebook page called "Q CONNECTIONS" ...seems highly relevant!!!!!! "Marina Abramovich introducing " James Franco: The last unicorn" — with Sabrina Querci, Matteo Ceccarini and Marina Abramovic."

           Then we have found a 'Satanic Banking Partner' in UBS Bank out of Switzerland. They even put Marina Abramovich on their art page, including, again Art Basel! "UBS and Art UBS believes that good contemporary art reflects and influences trends in society, and at times might even suggest the future." "The Art Basel and UBS Global Art Market Report UBS and Art Basel co-publish the first Art Basel and UBS Global Art Market Report. 'The Art Market 2017' analyzes today's international art market. Written by renowned cultural economist Dr. Clare McAndrew, Founder of Arts Economics, it covers macro-economic trends within the industry, spanning the dealer and auction markets as well as the online sphere."

            The art of Elysium gives not one cent of any donations to needy children. I know I sound like a broken record but its financials are on its website.  I was recently in Monaco, St Tropez and Ibiza. This satanist illuminati shit is everywhere, ESPECIALLY in Monte Carlo and St Tropez where the mega rich live. It's all on show, from some of the world's leading artists and sculptors exhibiting in front of the Jacques Cousteau museum, to nightclubs called Monarch featuring the butterfly and the all-seeing eye,  to art galleries selling Banksy, Koons etc with pedo and satanist messages. It has started from the top and is now filtering down .  Ibiza jewellery featuring all seeing eye and shops featuring satanic symbols. I don't know that those further down the chain like small shop owners in Ibiza know their meaning but maybe they do.  Rome also has a little district selling satanist shit.

            Abramovich will be rebeanded as filth with continued exposure. Her associations are bread crumbs for us to follow for now, but as our movement grows, mire and more people will cause a clamor of outrage that may eventually remove her from the public stage. When/if that happens, some of her associates will turn on her. Some will be erasing their connection history. It would be wise for us to take full advantage of this time that has so much of her activities still publicly visible and investigate the heck out of her, her public associates, fans, history and donors. An in depth profile of that would be a worthy stcky post.

            UBS, Credit Suisse and Deutsche banks all important in remote wind farm in northern Maine. ..built by First Wind. First Wind bought out assets of Enron..which was into wind farms. .....primarily owned by two hedge funds..Rahm Emmanuel had a big stake in one, Larry Summers the other. Some thought it was only used for tax shelter..I think maybe money laundering. Deutsche Bank prosecuted in EU for crimes in wind farm/renewable energy credits. It is like prohibition in the 30s. Mafia dream.
