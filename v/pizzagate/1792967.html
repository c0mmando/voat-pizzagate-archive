<p>According to an interview with Jones on HBO, after graduating from college in 1965, he borrowed a million dollars from Jimmy Hoffa\'s Teamsters union to open up a string of <strong>Shakey\'s Pizza</strong> Parlor restaurants in Missouri. Check Shakey\'s Pizza if you like. I didn\'t take this route. Just scrolled down their instagram and webpage and a page about the &quot;history of Pizzerias&quot; (<a href="http://archive.is/6IR4W">the page</a> is much weirder than just history) found three maybe suspiscious facts on the fly. I won\'t go deeper on Shakey\'s. Maybe you will?! </p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Suspicious about Shakey\'s Pizza</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>In 1954 they invented the concept of a pizzeria chain</li>
<li>This is how they <a href="http://imgur.com/bwSha3d">promote their Valentines Day Offer</a>. Questions would be: Why a child? Why the heart in heart design? Why the heck the term &quot;Relationship Status Pizza Lover&quot;?</li>
<li>And this is a category on their webpage: <a href="http://www.shakeys.com/fundraisers/">Fundraisers</a> Why the picture of a boy? And look at what they support. Lots of stuff for kids. </li>
</ul>
<hr />
<p><strong>Back to Jerry Jones</strong></p>
<p>So the first thing <strong>Jerry Jones</strong> wanted to do was owning pizzerias. And Pizza has stayed in his focus until today. </p>
<ul>
<li>1995 he did <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qReJmeKUGWw">this comercial for Pizza Hut</a>, </li>
<li>2007 he <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knyMRGVSsE4">danced for Papa John\'s Pizza</a>.</li>
<li>Here he is <a href="http://www.nfl.com/videos/dallas-cowboys/0ap2000000055569/Jerry-Jones-rapping-about-pizza">rapping for Papa John Pizza</a>.</li>
<li>He took place in the #Mannequinchallenge and they somehow felt the need to do it in the most impossible environment, <a href="https://twitter.com/CJonesAnderson/status/795412181185597440/video/1">a private jet where they share some Pizza</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>He even <a href="https://sportsday.dallasnews.com/other-sports/superbowllocal/2011/02/03/how-cowboys-owner-jerry-jones-found-a-way-to-profit-on-super-bowl">profits from every Pizza sold at the stadium and has very close ties to Papa John\'s Pizza</a></p>
<p>From this article:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Jones family owns a 49 percent stake in 75 Texas Papa John‚Äôs stores, primarily in North Texas. Papa John‚Äôs, a sponsor of the Cowboys and the NFL, owns 51 percent. Nationwide, Papa John‚Äôs has 2,875 stores.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>and:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Super Sunday is one of the biggest days for pizza in America. Schnatter (Owner of Papa John\'s) predicted his company would sell 1 million pizzas nationwide on Sunday, up from 900,000 a year ago. He estimated, roughly, that Jones‚Äô stores would sell about 26,000 pizzas. Most of those would be sold even if the game weren‚Äôt played in North Texas.</p>
<p>Papa John‚Äôs declined to say how much revenue those numbers would produce. But multiplying by $10 (the special price for any large Papa John‚Äôs pizza in the days leading up to the game) offers at least a ballpark idea of possible revenues: a quarter of a million dollars for Jones‚Äô stores and $10 million companywide.</p>
<p>Schnatter said Jones and the Cowboys have been good business partners. ‚ÄúI wish I had 30 more Jerry Joneses, frankly,‚Äù Schnatter said. ‚ÄúI couldn‚Äôt find a better partner.‚Äù</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<p><strong>Let\'s check Papa John\'s instagram</strong></p>
<p>They <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/BRoqBneDR73/">celebrate the Day of ùùÖ</a> (number Pi)
Why shouldn\'t they? Pi sounds like the first letter of Pizza. There\'s even a Pizzeria called ùùÖ Pizza which happens to be one of Obamas favourites pizza places. </p>
<p><a href="http://pi-pizza.com/company">From their site</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Pi is a U.S. Presidential Favorite!</strong>
President Barack Obama first experienced Pi Pizzeria in October 2008, at an event under the St. Louis Gateway Arch. That‚Äôs pretty cool anyway‚Ä¶but we were blown away by what happened next. We got a call from the President himself, who told us Pi was the best pizza he‚Äôd ever had. WOW.</p>
<p>In April 2009, we had the distinct honor and privilege to be invited to the White House to cook for the First Family. That made Pi Pizzeria the first restaurant to prepare food at the White House. We can still hardly believe it ourselves. Find more on this epic moment in Pi history here.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And what about this creepy club? <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paedophile_Information_Exchange">PIE (Paedophile Information Exchange)</a>
(wikipedia). We know Obama is famous for loving pie, <a href="https://www.google.de/search?q=obama+obsessed+with+pie&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;oe=utf-8&amp;client=firefox-b&amp;gfe_rd=cr&amp;ei=b6fwWOnMH4fSXq6BirgN">he often expresses his love for pie</a>.
Pie, Pi, Pizza ‚Ä¶ it\'s not far from one another. This blog submission called <a href="http://www.pi314.net/eng/piday.php">the world of ùùÖ </a> shows you exactly how close they are. </p>

<hr />
<p><strong>About Jones art collection</strong></p>
<p>When I read <a href="https://www.forbes.com/profile/jerry-jones/">about him on forbes online</a>, I found it a little odd that they wrote about one piece of art he bought around the time when he bought the Cowboys, too. It stands out from the rest of the short article in being a little too specific:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>An avid art collector, he acquired Norman Rockwell\'s painting &quot;Coin Toss&quot; at the same time he bought the Cowboys, but Jones is still chasing the kind of on-the-field success he had in the early 1990s.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I googled Rockwell and found <a href="http://www.midnightfreemasons.org/2013/06/famous-american-freemason-norman.html">this blog of an actual Illuminati member</a>, called Todd. E. Creason.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Todd E. Creason, 33¬∞ is the founder of the Midnight Freemasons blog and continues to be a regular contributor. He is the author of several books and novels, including the Famous American Freemasons series. He is member of Homer Lodge No. 199, and a Past Master of Ogden Lodge No. 754 (IL). He is a member the Scottish Rite Valley of Danville, the York Rite Bodies of Champaign/Urbana (IL), the Ansar Shrine (IL), Eastern Illinois Council No. 356 Allied Masonic Degrees, and Charter President of the Illini High Twelve in Champaign-Urbana (IL).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>His article about Norman Rockwell says </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Bro. Norman Rockwell was a member of Red Mountain Lodge No. 63 F.&amp; A.M., Arlington, Vermont.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I want to keep it as short as possible. So go, search for other works belonging to the Jones. I strongly recommend the Sky Mirror first. It gave me a weired feeling. </p>

<p><strong>Jerry Jones and connections to the satanic?!</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://bleacherreport.com/articles/307211-the-devil-and-mrjones-the-cowboys-culture-and-the-prince-of-darkness">This article about Caelum Moors</a> The author is wondering whether there could be something to the rumors that this statue is a work of the devil and why it was placed near to the stadium of the Cowboys. </p>
<p>When Leonard Davis was playing for the Cowboys 2010, he talked <a href="http://www.sportressofblogitude.com/2010/02/04/be-forewarned-nfl-players-satan-wants-your-soul/">about the temptations of the NFL in an interview</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>‚ÄúThe biggest thing is for Christians who come into the league or [for] those of us who are already here is to know is that Satan is definitely on the prowl. He wants to see us fail.‚Äù</p>

<hr />
<p>This is where I stop. What do you think about PI? What about Jerry Jones, about Papa John\'s Pizza, Shakey\'s Pizza, the Dallas Cowboys, the NFL, the Super Bowl???</p>',

             Pi is a U.S. Presidential Favorite!
            </strong>
            President Barack Obama first experienced Pi Pizzeria in October 2008, at an event under the St. Louis Gateway Arch. That‚Äôs pretty cool anyway‚Ä¶but we were blown away by what happened next. We got a call from the President himself, who told us Pi was the best pizza he‚Äôd ever had. WOW.
           </p>
           <p>
            In April 2009, we had the distinct honor and privilege to be invited to the White House to cook for the First Family. That made Pi Pizzeria the first restaurant to prepare food at the White House. We can still hardly believe it ourselves. Find more on this epic moment in Pi history here.

           When I read

            about him on forbes online
           </a>
           , I found it a little odd that they wrote about one piece of art he bought around the time when he bought the Cowboys, too. It stands out from the rest of the short article in being a little too specific:
          </p>
          <blockquote>
           <p>
            An avid art collector, he acquired Norman Rockwell's painting "Coin Toss" at the same time he bought the Cowboys, but Jones is still chasing the kind of on-the-field success he had in the early 1990s.

          <p>
           I googled Rockwell and found

             It's suspicious becausein our now known narrative it is all about covering up your crimes by buidling up fake stores. If you can get a chain running, this will definately make your business much easier. But another thing: Did you read everything I posted? Did you follow any link? Or how come you judge this whole threat very hard and you explain it to us with just ONE objection. You see a bunch of hearts? How so? In every corner there is a heart in heart in Pizza shape. You have a yellow heart (dough) with a red heart (toping) within.

              Honestly,  i did not.  Reading the entire thing,  I would consider a waste of time.  The one objection is all that is needed IMO.  It thoroughly demonstrates the remainder of the post is going to be full of half crazy claims with no evidence.    In light of pizzagate or not, someone starting a pizzeria chain is not suspicious. It's not evidence of anything except just that.  Secondly you're analysis of the hearts is flawed on so many levels.  I would've kept reading, but this was enough for me to illustrate that this persons post is useless to me, and the community.  What you are doing is not research,  it's haphazardly thrown together crazyness.

               Thanks for admitting. It's useless to discuss about something you didn't even read. Let me beg you for all your next comments on Pizzagate: Please check if you comment for discussing facts or if you just feel the need to spit fire. I try not to be offended by all your prejudice.

                Well,  as admitted I did not read the rest of your post because what I did read WAS NOT facts.  2 points I countered, and you ignored.

                  What is suspicious about being the first pizzaria to start a chain?

               <p>
                It's not even close,  it's just a bunch of hearts.  Every instance of a heart or a spiral is not an indication of pedophilia.
               </p>
               <ol>
                <li>
                 Why the picture of a boy?  So every instance of a child is now related to pedophilia now?  Ridiculous.
                </li>
               </ol>
               <p>
                So the 3 bullet points you posted that you label "suspicious" have no basis for what you are claiming.  There's in fact nothing suspicious about any of them.  So after read that, I discontinued reading.
               </p>
               <p>
                So, i can tear apart the rest of your "facts" if you would like, but I hope this demonstrates to someone out there, that this is very flawed logic.
               </p>
               <p>
                You want to talk facts, please bring some to the table for discussion.

                  You should really be a politician.  You juke the issue like a pro.  I did in fact partially read your post, and what I read was illogical.  In addition, I logically refuted what claims of yours i did read.  What I'm surprised about, is you completely ignored my break down of your "suspicious" points about the pizzeria.

           </p>
           <p>
            Seriously, lets take a step back and try to read it without the facts that we know about PG. Whats the point of this statement? A lot of people love pizza, so there is no way you would be special for loving it. Who cares if someone loves a certain food? Maybe this should be funny, how?
           </p>
           <p>
            Now reading it PG-related it takes you somewhere else:
           </p>
           <p>
            WHEN YOU LOVE PIZZA ..AND YOU DONT CARE WHO KNOWS IT!
           </p>
           <p>
            What gives C-Predators/Satanists a greater high then doing something illegal/wrong/extreme by even telling it and ending up with no consequences? They feel above the law.

            awesome fucking research dude. Jones always gave me the fucking creeps. I think he's got pizza dust all over his suit. Hell, it looks like he probably started the whole kid trafficking industry. And he has panda eyes that keep coming back even after multiple plastic surgeries.

            Good thread bro. Someone posted about that 84yo nfl team owner dying the other day. I was searching something unrelated and decided to START GOOGLING SURNAMES
           </p>
           <p>
            <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lurie">
             https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lurie
            </a>
            Lurie is a Jewish surname.
           </p>
           <p>
            It is one of the oldest family trees in the world, tracing back at least to King David born c. 1037 BCE, as documented by Neil Rosenstein in his book The Lurie Legacy.[1] It contains many famous members such as Karl Marx, Sigmund Freud, Felix Mendelssohn, Martin Buber, Rashi, and Hezekiah.[2][3

              Obviously because the vast majority of researchers are male. So it's not interesting that I assumed you were male, it is actually quite unremarkable.  Notice how you haven't  yet said outright that you're female, but your remark has exposed you as such LOL

               :) Actually I did. Lots of time. In this thread too. And next thing I find interesting is that you claim to know statistics about the gender of researchers. :D 
Let's stop right here. It's not important. God bless.

            It's hard to say what's going on here. My take is Jones isn't aware of the occult references in that statue. After all the best trick Satan every played is convincing the world he doesn't exist. Who knows who believes what anymore. Up until 2 months ago I didn't think 9/11 was an inside job either.
           </p>
           <p>
            I do know one thing though and that's when the music stops on this monolithic fraud that statue and any other statue that can even remotely be tied to the occult will be pulverized into a million little pieces with explosives and then further broken down in industrial stone crushers and finally dumped into blast furnaces to burn away any remaining evil in the event the first two steps didn't work.

            Good posts are either deleted or buried. Shit posts have overtaken the forum. Numbers are way down. Mods remind me of our compromised federal judges with their WTF rulings. Inmates are running the asylum. We REALLY must move elsewhere because this place is about dead. Let's figure it out and get it done. Suggestions?

            "a page about the "history of Pizzerias" (the page is much weirder than just history) found three maybe suspiscious facts on the fly."

            I saw nothing suspicious there.

            And if you're going to find a plain heart logo suspicious, then be prepared to have damn near EVERY food chain under your microscope.  It's a PLAIN HEART, not a heart within a heart or even a stylized heart that's similar to a heart within a heart.

            Shakey's is a CHAIN FOR CHILDREN -- it was sort of a forerunner to Chuck E Cheese -- and always has been.  So using kids in their ads is more "normal" than unusual.  I loved it as a kid back in the late 60s and early 70s.

             And after all we've learned now this is exactly one of the points making an organisation or company suspicious. If "targeting" kids is their mission maybe this has to be taken literally. What do you think we are doing here,

               Exactly my point about being the first to start a pizza chain.  There is absolutely nothing suspicious about that in and of itself.  But she refuses to either admit that or elaborate.  I would also like to get one thing straight.  Jerry Jones could be involved for all i know.  Hell, honestly it wouldn't surprise me in the least.  But the "research"/claims put forth just does not stand on firm ground.  It's crazy claims, opinions, weird suspicions and just out right tin foil hat shit.  I am not attacking her, but the thread and subsequent posts submitted.

               Well, Public Relations is where many can be hiding in plain sight.  There are plenty of  leads we have discovered just by researching something we thought was too "out there" sometimes.  That's how the FBI works sometimes.  Just doing the hard work.

                That's not suspicious. It's when you hire shady characters to work with kids that it gets suspicious.

                 With all of the trafficking discovered around the Super Bowl and Obama's connection to the owner of the Detroit Lions, I think there is room for research.  I understand your feelings, they are valid.  So are mine, which means someone should dig into this.

                   There are many moving parts everywhere.  There are crazy connections all over the US.  That is how they make everything work within all the hubs.  Hospitals owned by Tenet Healthcare are involved especially if there is a heliport and airports and seaports and docks nearby.  All is important to getting the Organ Receivers to the right place at the right time. If there is Trafficking nearby, all the more suspect.  These are the Suppliers of Organs.  This is disgusting at best.  Nothing should be overlooked.

            Both Shakeys and Papa Johns have 1,000's of franchises a piece. Any connection to those companies would be tenuous at best.

            Jerry Jones always seemed like he took too much of a hands on role with players though (pun intended.) I wouldn't be surprised if a few of those contracts didn't come with a dick in somebody...
