<p>Elementary school children across the country are belting-out the song, &quot;Pizza Love,&quot; sung to to the tune of the oldies hit, &quot;My Girl,&quot; by The Temptations.  These kids are singing it in assembly-type performances for parent and family audiences.  Here are the lyrics to &quot;Pizza Love:&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;On a Monday, I’ve got pizza love. 
Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, I’ve got pizza love.
Wo. Pizza pizza on my brain.  Make it pepperoni or make it plain.
My pizza. Wo.  Pizza pizza. I’ve got pizza love.
I can’t stop! I just have to chew when I see that cheesy goo.
I can’t stop!  And I think I’ll cry if I find some onions on my pizza pie.
Oh my pizza. I love you so. Your tangy sauce. Your crusty dough.
You must have been sent from up above to fill my heart with pizza love.
On a Friday I’ve got pizza love.
On Saturday Sunday I’ve got pizza love.
Wo. Pizza pizza, what you do to me. When I eat my pizza I hear symphony. 
My pizza. Wo. Pizza pizza. I’ve got pizza love.
I can’t stop! I just have to chew when I see that cheesy goo.
I can’t stop! And I think I’ll cry if I find some onions on my pizza pie.
I’ve got pizza love.  <br />
Pizza love. I’ve got pizza love.&quot;</p>
<p>And here is a link to a video of a group of children from an elementary school in Orange County, CA, singing &quot;Pizza Love&quot; to the tune of &quot;My Girl.&quot;
<a href="https://youtu.be/YhAoIzHcuOA">https://youtu.be/YhAoIzHcuOA</a></p>
<p>It\'s not just this one particular school who decided to post a video.  In no time at all, I easily found 14 additional videos of children singing away in schools throughout the country.  Now, I don\'t know about anybody else, but I don\'t see or find any &quot;cuteness&quot; in the song\'s subject matter or lyrics, but there are a hell-of-a-lot of schools and teachers out there who do.  And I find that pretty damn sick.  If I am not totally out in left field, then this pizzagate debacle which I thought couldn\'t get any worse beyond my comprehension is now...what?  I have no words, and my brain is numb.  
</p>
<p>&quot;Pizza Love&quot; is one of the many songs included in &quot;Music K-8 Magazine,&quot; (Plank Road Publishings) authored by Teresa Jennings.  This magazine is highly respected by elementary teachers, particularly in the US.  Plank Road Publishings is owwned by Teresa Jennings and her husband, Paul Jennings, who reside in Wisconsin.  Based on just a cursory check on this couple and their company, I found nothing that caught my attention other than benign information such asTeresa Jennings having impressive credentials and that her father worked for NASA.</p>',

            I knew that your username sounded familiar.... we'd spoken before on the topic of Racine, Lake Forest, etc.... Speaking of Lake Forest and the fact that Podesta used to work at a now-nonexistent college named Barat (building razed for housing) and that it's so close to Racine, wonder what I could find out if I asked around; however, I think his time at Barat was decades ago, so.... Plus we all know how crazy we sound speaking to non-piller's about something like Pizzagate, lol, but there's a little bar in LF that I like to go to &amp; maybe next time I'll strike a convo with someone, see what's mentioned.

            Yes you are right-Type 1 is a condition you are born with, hence it being more commonly referred to as "juvenile" diabetes. Type 2 is where your body begins to not respond to insulin properly--likely an autoimmune response. This is caused by poor eating habits and inactivity but I also believe it is caused by an overload of vaccines tricking our bodies in to various immune responses. I think that in some people, too many vaccines have caused various erratic immune responses--such as Type 2 diabetes, MS, lupus and even peanut allergies. They trick our bodies in to thinking they had an illness, but I think it goes awry sometimes. BTW I am an RN with an MPH (Masters of Public Health) and I would NEVER repeat this at work LOL

            "pizzagate" forum aside, I agree with Pizzalawyer that pizza is a special treat that shouldn't be eaten on a daily basis. Lyrics like these confuse the children at the very least in to thinking that it is "okay" to eat all the time.
           </p>
           <p>
            There is definitely something to the pizza slice being used by Miley Cyrus and other teeny bopper stars. They have dresses made out of it and I see lots of PJ's at the store with pizza all over them. We know these illuminati types love symbolism so there has GOT to be more to it than just pizza is something most people love to eat.

            Please see my reply to Shillary below -- 
but also, yes -- we have a lot of problems with the degrading of our water by pollution.
PLUS anything that we take into our bodies, such as drugs, also finally end up in our water.
           </p>
           <p>
            Erin Brockovich has also just recently made clear how polluted our drinking water is all over the nation.
           </p>
           <p>
            Again -- will be back later with links.
           </p>
           <p>
            Thank you for your patience -- may have to happen later today.  :(

            You guys beat me to it. Yes vaccines are the number one cause of Type 1 Diabetes. 
Type 2 diabetes is caused primarily by feeding any food prior to age 6 months other than breastmilk from your mother, as well as antidepressants, HFCS, and that's about it. Too many women are drugged up in their pregnancies and then either breastfeed on meds, or switch to formula which stimulates pancreatic autoimmune disorder, i.e. diabetes.

             Shillary --
            </p>
            <p>
             So glad that others know about this -- 
In fact, researchers are making these huge discoveries about vaccines which have so long been taken for granted as being benign and where we have now had more than a 20 year "ridicule/Mockingbird" program keeping challenges to vaccines going on to prevent discussions about links to Autism.
            </p>
            <p>
             The propaganda levels by the "infant formula" interests are still at very high levels to protect their profits.
Had doctors stuck by women and children they wouldn't have been able to put this farce over on the nation.
            </p>
            <p>
             They are also going all the way back to Sudden Infant Death Syndrome where vaccines could in fact be the cause.
Also colic and projectile spitting which show the dysfunction that are caused in the gastrointestinal tract.
            </p>
            <p>
             Further, Autism and Schizophrenia have a lot in comment where the disease is effecting the brain and caused by over-pruning or under-pruning of the synapses.  In one case it's over pruning and in the other it's under pruning.
I can supply more info on this if anyone wishes.
AND, while schizophrenia is of course considered an ancient disease, keep in mind that men have long been
digging up metals from the earth which are obviously harmful to all of us.
Homeopathic doctors have been working on the idea of cleansing metals from the system of children with Autism
and have showed promising results.  So promising that a number of them seem to have been murdered.

               Summary is just too long to post here - HOWEVER .....
              </p>
              <p>
               If you go to the link below, it's a website where I sometimes post and I've put my SUMMARY up there.
              </p>
              <p>
               My suggestion is that you copy the post and email it to yourself -- that's what I usually do with info I want to save.

                 Hi -- Just reviewing what I've saved of vaccine threads and will post a few links.
But there are so many vaccine websites posting the truth and challenge the industry and government
you can pretty much find an answer at any one of them in a search.
                </p>
                <p>
                 If you need anything else, let me know -- and I'm presuming you know about Dr. Thompson (whistleblower) ...
                </p>
                <p>
                 <strong>
                  Has the CDC Whistleblower Been Given Immunity to Speak About Vaccines?

                </p>
                <p>
                 Presume you know about Simpsonwood Meetings reported in "Deadly Immunity" ?

                <p>
                 EDITED to include this note ...
Seems one of the links I was trying to send you re Dr. Thompson is "banned" here.   (!!!)
but you can just do a search on the internet for all the info on him -- including at YouTube.

                   Hi Shillary -- 
Have you copied the info I left at Project Avalon for you?
I'd like to remove it so it doesn't become a problem for them.
Thanks

               Shillary --
              </p>
              <p>
               Wow ... just realized I didn't get back with links today -- !!
              </p>
              <p>
               (later) Will connect you with some websites which cover current thinking on the harm of  vaccines.
              </p>
              <p>
               But presuming you are also interested in the Autism/Schizophrenia?
              </p>
              <p>
               My awareness of this came from a** New Yorker article **spring before last which I'll give you a link to.
Covers the family situation - "It runs in the family" -- but you can ignore the family story and just pay attention to the research.
If you read the entire article you will notice that there were two other studies going on which eventually also had bearing on the main one -- i.e., one on eyes and brain connection and the other on ears and brain connection.
              </p>
              <p>
               These were 3 independent studies which eventually came together in recognition that the problem is damage to the brain.
Just as an aside, they also showed that the "hallucinations" which those afflicted with schizophrenia may have are actually real, they are visual to the patient.  Same for "hearing voices" where what is being heard is actually real.
              </p>
              <p>
               But, I also summarized the article's findings which I will include for you.  It is, however, really long so I'll have to see if I can do it.  While I take a look at that problem, here's also a brief comment on the article by me which I think is very pertinent because to my amazement given the discoveries the FIRST response was to try to create a drug to deal with the problem rather than trying to find out what's doing this damage to the brain.
              </p>
              <blockquote>
               <p>
                Locating the genes and understanding where they are failing isn't enough --
               </p>
               <p>
                They have to ask why the genes are failing.
               </p>
               <p>
                In the case of Autism, those genes are failing in the opposite direction:  an overabundance of synapses not being cleared.
               </p>
               <p>
                However, this is all damage to the immune system and ultimately nervous system.
               </p>
               <p>
                Rather than a genetic illness, it is damage to the genes.
               </p>
               <p>
                And, I believe we begin to see the relationship between the harm being done to the
               </p>
               <p>
                brain and overall to the immune and nervous systems, in both Autism and Schizophrenia.
               </p>
              </blockquote>
              <p>
               Here's the **New Yorker article -- Runs in the Family **
               <a href="http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2016/03/28/the-genetics-of-schizophrenia">

              </p>
              <p>
               At about 12:30 minutes on the video you will find him discussing the similarities of schizophrenia and autism.  As covered in the article below, Autism a condition where the synapses are over-pruning of synapses, while in the case of schizophrenia the synapses are being under-pruned.

            I have family members with diabetes so I am sympathetic, maybe my choice of disease was wrong but I wanted to gripe about the connection of unhealthy food and unhealthy bodies to say nothing of unhealthy souls. Schools have allowed junk food into our kids diet and I regard the typical pizza as junk food. Thank you for appreciating my other comments. I'll try to be more aware.

            OMG I want to barf. Just this morning on ESPN they used the following phrase about 3 times in 30 seconds: "Bad Boy Lover" 
That's a "bad boy" lover I'm sure, but it sounds like a bad "boy lover" to me. 
Also I saw a woman at Walmart (I could swear she would have won an ugly contest) wearing a Pizza purse that was hanging right next to her crotch, and I almost threw up right on her. All I could think was that she was advertising that she sells kids or something because it wasn't cute at all. Also, my friend posted a photo of her kids with the caption "I love pizza" and then my other friend dressed up her kid as a hot dog to go to school. I would just like for everyone to know about this so they will Just Say No to all of this brainwashing subliminal message shit that does nothing but arouse elite pedos.

            From what I understand, pizza is on its way out in school cafeterias - 
so is sugar and salt, soft drinks.
All to the good.
Possibly the children don't understand the "pizza" connection, but I imagine quite a few parents
understand it.  Maybe move all the pizza out very soon.

            , you are right-on about Kevin Jennings, school czar and NAMBLA supporter.  He is Paul Jennings' younger brother.  In Kevin Jennings' 2006 book, "Mama's Boy, Preacher's Son: A Memoir," he describes growing up dirt-poor and speaks of Paul as barely noticing Kevin's existence.  He further described Paul as a "golden child...his golden status curdled as he became a bullshit artist as an adolescent and an adult, never taking responsibility for his actions, telling tales that were beyond belief to avoid the consequences of his behavior...he pulled it off thanks to his good looks and charm."  When they slept in the same bedroom as children, Paul made Kevin sleep on the bottom bunk bed so, "the rats would crawl on him," and not Paul.

            I am beginning to think we may be on to something much bigger than it initially looked.

            We know "cheese pizza" is used to ORDER CHILD PORN.
           </p>
           <p>
            You believe these kids are ordering child porn?
           </p>
           <p>
            Because any use outside of that context is most likely just childish games.

             v/pizzagate2

            or include the link here. People won't be able to vote on content, downvote bullshit comments by mods, etc. but at least they can read stuff.

            was talking about.  But as far as this being introduced in school,especially CA of all places.  It kind of falls into this same agenda public schools have been on for a while now. Early sex ED, transgender ect.  "Social Engineering" type hype.  My first grand-child is 1mo an unless shit changes, she'll never be in a public school.  This is part of why we now have a bunch of entitled, don't speak or look at me, snowflakes!  They will barely, if ever, be able to function normally in the outside world socially or productively from this nanny-state indoctrination.  MTV, South Park, Pedo Man Bill Nye and I'm sure many others have contributed to this.  But at least we can control (or should monitor) what our children are influenced by when at home, but this influence in school is getting beyond ludicrous.  There seems to be clear intent to decimate and subjugate our youth, right under our noses...

             I hear you Ma!! The other day we had a talk about transgendered kids and my son was like I am never gonna be a girl boys rule! I have never been so happy to hear misogyny in my life!! Thank God I don't have to contend with the tail trying to wag the dog and doing so by picking your own gender.

             Guys, I've lived not more than 30 mins from Racine for almost 20 years. I consider myself quite versed in "conspiracy" and such, yet until recently I'd never heard any other sites on any other relatable subjects ever mention Racine. It freaks me out that I live so close to what some say is the epicenter of it all and I didn't know. Can someone please explain to me the moment that the Racine connections were made regarding Pizza, Agenda 21, etc.... How is Racine, of all places, the epicenter of everything Rothschild, Rockefeller,.....? I don't doubt it for one second. Just curious how I missed it when I live so close and have studied this stuff for years.

             Most recent town I can determine is Wauwatosa which is 34.4 miles from Racine.  Close enough.

            Maybe those schools in particular have pedo directors, teachers, etc, and its their way of pushing back against pizzagate? We should make a list of these schools, dig a little to see if there is anything suspicious going on about their activity(ies) or their personnel...

            Just ignore the sex aspect for a moment, these kids are singing tribute to a food source of dubious nutritional value. So we'll end up with fat pedophiles and fat victims who will be struggling with diabetes and hypertension while conflicted over sexuality. Our teachers and parents are indeed clueless.

            Bloody hell, this hole goes deep!  Great observation and research btw.  With all we have discovered and ruminated on up to this point, it's hard not to consider the plausibility of a connection here.  We know that elite paedophilia has been going on since the dawn of man and that pizza has been around for approx 130 years so this trope of association between pizza and child abuse may go back a long long time?  Is this particular example further predictive programming/revelation of the method?
