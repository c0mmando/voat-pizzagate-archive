            some of these videos are fake/prank videos, like staged someone getting their younger brother to play along and they're recent, at least that is my theory, some of these may be frauds and hoaxes created post-pizzagate, to be presented as pizzagate evidence, even though it is fake.
           </p>
           <p>
            others, usually never on youtube (you might find them on liveleak but more likely the worst of them will be on the dark net and deep web, TOR browser, encrypted platforms where people can buy drugs or guns or the pedo and snuff/death films that are too illegal for the regular internet. i've never seen these real death videos but i saw a photograph with the title of one, from a 4chan post. the expression on the child's face made me think it was real. he was full clothed and it wasn't sexual at all, the title just said "child being prepared for organ harvesting" and he looked about 8. now, that could have been fake too, but i think there is a look of dread and immediate death that can't be faked and seeing that in a still photograph was enough to give me nightmares.
           </p>
           <p>
            it sounds to me like the videos you're talking about are the ones that are made to go viral in regards to pizzagate. unless the upload date is before october 2016, then i guess my theory wouldn't make sense. i guess my point is that the real horrible stuff exists off youtube on other sites and the encrypted dark websites.

            with absolute caution. Especially if the PG researcher hasn't built up a reputation anywhere.
           </p>
           <p>
            Be weary of anything as you could be clicking on anything at all -regardless of what you're being told it is....
 and yes ANY type of CP that resides on any of your devices for any length of time can get you in a whole heap of trouble.
           </p>
           <p>
            To be completely honest, if the researcher is truly a researcher, they'll already have understood the implications and dangers of this.  Let them place their info in such a manner that follows the rules and it may possibly be presented in a "safer"manner...or even sharing where sourced from, if at all possible.
           </p>
           <p>
            Videos like what you mention only further possibly confirm the actions and behaviors (there's still possibility for staging these things without faces or names to prove anything)-  but again with nothing there to prove who, where or when - what is reasoning for sharing such videos?
           </p>
           <p>
            It's like watching a video of a car crash on the internet.  It really doesn't do much good if there's no particulars about the subjects in the video- it only highlights the fact that there was an unsafe road somewhere...for lack of better way to put it.
           </p>
           <p>
            Just a word of warning, if you don't know the source (which is likely because of the high anonymity here) you're best not to click on anything unless you've properly set up whatever device you're on to ensure your own anonymity.  IP address, machine names, network, etc. can be traced down by simply clicking on a link on an unsecured device.
           </p>
           <p>
            That's my 2 cents.  If it truly is something worthwhile to the community, then the researcher should put it out there and let folks sort through it and determine the value of such things.

             This "researcher" does not have a good reputation here, but there's no way these videos are faked.

             My gut feeling is that he's wanting to crack this case, but he's trying to disperse some of the researching risk onto others. He said he did lots of his research via the darkweb.

              If they came from the darkweb, it's likely they're not fake....I've spend time in the shallow end of the pool of the darkweb, and it's pretty easy to find what we'd deem questionable content regarding PG within a couple of minutes.
Ultimately, it's your choice how to proceed, but to me it comes down to the actual content and how will it bring results.  Is it just highlighting more of the sick or twisted stuff that doesn't help the victim nor identify or bring the perpetrator to justice?
             </p>
             <p>
              I was in /pol the other night and some sick ass kept posting gore/snuff vids- really didn't help anything other than make them like an even sicker f*ck than they already were for housing that much of it and keeping it in their possession.
             </p>
             <p>
              That said, you have to weigh it out- if it's not really helping, then what is it doing?  is it simply to get upvoats for posting sick crap that's related to what we're looking at or is it really something that is going to push the investigation forward and help the cause overall.
