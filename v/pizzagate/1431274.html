            I really think this is Maddy. The police even confirmed she had a mark on her left eye. She doesnt speak italian, but fluent english. And she knows how to behave.
           </p>

            I think they just brainwashed here again and dumped her in rome.

             Then you are wrong.  Even the MSM is now saying it's not Madeleine.  They have the woman's name and they are in contact with her father.
            </p>
            <p>
             Also, "and she knows how to behave?"  What's that got to do with anything?

              "Even the MSM", means what exactly now? They are in contact with the father because he said he is it, no proof though. And thats why they have the name, even though she gave a couple of names. Mostly Maria. She refuses to go with him, which if she really is his daughter is kind of suspicious. 
And she knows how to behave means that even though she doesnt talk and seems really traumatized, she knows how to eat well mannered. Which would be the last thing i'd give a shit about if i was in here state of mind.
             </p>
             <p>
              I might sound like a maniac, but given the situation we're in, could i really be so wrong?

            Even though the articles linked discuss other missing girls as well, this showed up on my FB feed as "Madeleine McCann."     I don't see this as having tremendous investigative value on its face, but I was flabbergasted at the sheer convenience of this story.    This is just a homeless woman, who is clearly much older than McCann would be.   The names of many missing girls could've been attached to her, but they immediately went with "Madeleine McCann has been found."
