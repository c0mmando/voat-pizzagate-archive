            Indeed you can fake anything on a web browser with local javascript (e.g. plugin). He would need to give his FB password to a trusted third-party and have him login in and check, OR he would have to log into a trusted third-party computer (through VNC or whatever) and access his FB through there (the computer admin would be recording the desktop session).
           </p>
           <p>
            The issue is one of trust. You cannot trust someone who speaks on YT, nor can you trust a computer you don't control. You could trust code, but you can't look at the code running on the guy's computer. You could however trust a third-party, who would have to be involved in the verification. That's the only way IMO without FB involvement (which would anyway also be a third-party).
           </p>
           <p>
            Faking this would be a good way to publicize his t-shirts. But the value of his shirts come from the funny catch phrases he came up with (which you can copy and easily make/order your own shirts with). Plus he found/published that museum kill room stuff. So my two cents is he's telling the truth. If he's a shill, he's not good at his job.

            You would be accusing him of brilliance then.  This guy is not making bank, but I give him an A for effort.  He would need to be smart enough to look dumb enough to seem smart enough yet appear too dumb to lie, but really being too dumb to have a motive to make it up.  Its a pretty elaborate lie that really isn't that good of a lie.  If someone was going to make this up, they would have done a much better job, and it would have been a much bigger lie/story.

            The Pegasus video is out there.. they might stamp it out or erase if they feel the need?
But for now I think it's mirrored and backed up.

            I don't believe it's a hoax: He's way too naive. And the work on the "killroom" is solid and very impressive to those who have seen it, I have heard.
           </p>

            I can't imagine someone so naive that they would apologize to Aleph. and not just hang up when he started threatening.

            100% agree. Just like Seaman there is an agenda at work here.

            I haven't been here in a while, but this whole situation very much caught my attention and I'm compelled to respond.
           </p>
           <p>
            Does this guy really expect us to believe that out of all the people who have likely tried to contact JA, he was the ONE lucky person to not only get a response, but also somehow manages to get him on the phone? I'm sorry, but this whole story is outlandish and highly implausible if you use logical reasoning. For those of you who think that this situation is simply too complex to be a hoax, nowadays this is a job that any technically apt person can do within a few hours. I also agree with those of you who find it strange how he chose not to record any subsequent conversations and also continues to post videos about this experience even though he was supposedly "threatened" by JA and forced to take down the previous posts for fear of his life. That is a pretty strong indication that this whole thing is a huge hoax.

              Seriously? Any good investigator would at least try to get information from the source. It's a bit unbelievable to think that out of all the great researchers on and off this site only a handful of people have attempted to message JA through social media or other avenues.

We have no power of compelling answers.
Do you expect him to answer truthfully?

               This is not the New York Times, who needs to look or a denial or explanation from the person under suspicion.

               Aleph's already had his say on TV, hasn't he?
He's made his position very plain. As well as participation in the fake event at his Pizza Shop.

               I would consider it dangerous to contact him.

                No offense, but that's exactly the type of attitude that lends itself to ineffectual research. You don't have to be a professional journalist to know how to ask the right questions to catch someone in a lie. There are YouTubers who have reported on the JA interview he did on Fox and they've talked about the questions that could have been asked. HighImpactFlix is the first one that comes to mind, but you'd could easily do the research on other vids with similar topics regarding what information we should be asking JA if given the opportunity. Whether any of these individuals has tried to contact JA is beyond my scope of knowledge and that's what I am trying to establish to make an informed judgement on this guy's claim that he had such an engaging interaction. It honestly just sounds like a well planned false flag or hoax.
               </p>
               <p>
                I may be misunderstanding, but your argument that people are afraid to talk about this subject doesn't make sense. That's the whole purpose of these threads. If people were afraid, no one would be investigating, so I'm not sure what point you were trying to make with that response.

Don't ever take a confession from someone like that.

                 I 've been researching for a long time. And you are just wrong.
                </p>
                <p>
                 We are not [alleged] " journalists" with the Mass Media as our megaphone. 
We have no obligation to "tell both sides."
                </p>
                <p>
                 The other side of the story is told already by the Mainstream.
I know what happens to truth; 
Interviewing the guy isn't going to do anything., unless you are a prosecutor with powers to subpoena and with Aleph in jail - where he can't erase evidence.
                </p>
                <p>
                 Aleph is tipped off to such a degree he's likely even a member here!
.

                 Aleph is so certain of his safety that he is said to have confessed on the phone with this individual. 
It's considered a FEAT or a Trophy - to do that.

                 It's a job for a team of trained individuals - who actually know the law and have the power to prosecute.

                 They haven't arrested Aleph. Us talking to him is not going to change that. 
It will just give them a chance to claim harassment.

                 A phone call by someone who is likely deemed by the Mainstream as a "domestic terrorist" is not going to do anything but play into their script.

                 Make no doubt about it: The Mass Media is covering for him! And that is powerful

                 Aleph is under no obligation to answer any questions truthfully, over the telephone with someone he does not know. 
When he also knows it is a hostile questioning.

                  Honestly, this just sounds like the rant of a shill who is basically saying that the work that's being done is pointless because no one in here is trained to do proper research or interview him effectively. You have no clue what types of professionals take part in this site, so maybe you're the one who's wrong.

                  Are you really trying to say that you believe JA was using a hypnotic technique over text to get this guy to become submissive? Laughable. MK Ultra techniques aren't going to work that easily. This again just makes you sound like a shill trying to scare people into thinking this was a real situation that could happen to them if they aren't careful. I'm done engaging with you, but appreciate the opportunity to debate the topic. Thanks.

                   I would bet anything that very few people tried to contact him.  And out of those, probably only a handful were civil at all.  Youre asking for harassment charges by contacting him directly.  Look at Sandy Hook.  I can think of maybe only one guy who actually went and talked to anyone.  He went in person.  The other one i know of who contacted people went to jail for it.

                    You can't just be charged with harassment for contacting someone! If that were the case every person who has ever contacted a stranger would be arrested. Well, if you're a millennial I guess that would be your line of thinking, but I digress. Real journalists aren't just sitting around doing research behind a screen all day. They go out and try to get answers even if in some cases it means risking their lives. There are at least a couple of videos with YouTubers going to CPP to investigate and have they been charged with harassment? Of course not! Once it was apparent that they weren't welcome or asked to leave, they did it and that was the end of the experience. No one went to jail and to my knowledge these people have not been killed off. Some people are just braver than others, but in the case of this PizzaGateGear guy, I think it's a sham created to scare people away from continuing research. Mission failed.

            This was actually why I was skeptical. The video just looked to establish where the basement digging pic was taken. Doesn't seem to be incriminating enough to respond with threats since the pic doesn't establish a crime or anything just a location of a possible basement and construction, right? Of course, maybe he does have something at the place worth protecting, but then again why respond to the vid and give it more attention?

             He says the investigations are blocked from the top , and always have been for his entire career.
            </p>
            <p>
             Why?
            </p>
            <p>
             Because it's the people at the top.
            </p>
            <p>
             Why would Podesta's mother adopt 25 children and for some reason have an in with Presidents and powerful.

             Aleph is not scared, because he is protected.. No one is even getting him in Court. 
They could stage his "death" and then blame it on the crazy Pizzagaters..
            </p>
            <p>
             So don't "harass" these folks fools... What is gained?

             Nothing.

            "Give me your thoughts," that's an Alefantisism (cf. the original Pegasus video, the comment on the roof plan on Instagram). Kinda makes you think.

            Guys, we don't know if this is is a hoax.
           </p>
           <p>
            If it is a hoax, it is EXTREMELY elaborate and well done.
           </p>
           <p>
            And, if it is a hoax, it was done to sell tshirts, but nobody is buying those shirts. I'm not. Nobody else here is (more or less). It is BIZARRE, in the extreme, for someone to go to this length, just to sell tshirts. There are better ways to make money.
           </p>
           <p>
            And, finally: this guy did great research on Pegasus. That first Pegasus video is amazing. Now, ask yourself, whether this person did that video, which was amazing, and then faked an interview with JA, just to sell tshirts?
           </p>
           <p>
            Does that make sense? It doesn't make sense. None of it makes sense. What the fuck is happening to this country.

             Very Good. And here is the interview with the NYPD Detective, who was on this beat [pedo / child trafficing] for decades.. Why do these cases never get to trial?
            </p>
            <p>
             Because it's the people at the top involved, who block it.

            <p>
             That is why Aleph acts the way he does.
            </p>
            <p>
             He's a KNOWER; he a gnostic. He knows it.

             Well, there could be other motives besides just selling shirts and making money. 
The thing is, he has the attention of more people now than he has probably ever had before. More people know of him, and have great respect and admiration for him... Fame has been known to be a driver in people's actions, and they don't always think through what the long-term consequences may be. Maybe they don't care.
            </p>
            <p>
             I noticed that his latest video has 7,000+ more views than his second highest one, and this one hasn't even been up for one whole day. It could go viral, and who knows how far it will go...
            </p>
            <p>
             Finally, it's difficult to tell who people truly are based on what they allow you to see via the internet. They may appear to be great and helpful people on the surface (for example, redditor Carl Herold), but behind the mask, can be great darkness and ulterior motives. And you cannot see behind the mask until it falls because they make a mistake, or someone else reveals it. Sometimes, this mask never falls.

            Those are definitely plausible angles. I would add that another possibility is that ITGOT is suffering from some sort of mental illness, and that this was a planned, elaborate and one-sided act to gain lots of attention and $.
           </p>
           <p>
            I agree with what you said about the detail, and that it is reasonable to expect more. He's clearly not adverse to going into detail, as he goes into great detail with explaining the meaning of his and James's messages. James supposedly says many things which are emotionally charged. He should, as a result, be more likely to remember it. But perhaps he is trying to forget about it, and doesn't want to relive it by repeating it... because it was painful and scary to hear.

            The main part that draws my attention, is that ISGOT is obviously trying to make money from pizza gate merchandise here.  So the threats could be legitimate, or they could be made up for some (money making) attention.  I watched his videos and agree with much of his research and opinions, but the fact he is openly trying to sell things obviously casts at least a little doubt on his story.  Following on here for some of the more well versed computer experts opinions regarding veracity

            I just woke up to this and my opinion without finishing watching this video and checking if others got this same vibe, is that they started posting about this channel I never heard of being removed yesterday on and tried to make it a thing. Now this video is suppose to make us feel like we can all be found. I notice Mods and others who are listed on
            <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/v/pizzagate">
             v/pizzagate
            </a>
            keep changing as they are called out but the big one I noticed today is Kevdude is missing. He stands out to me because he was always jumping in to reprimand us and delete posts. I haven't found out why yet but he was, what I think was fake doxxed yesterday and for all I know this guy is him trying to scare us.﻿...while selling shirts AND maybe getting info on people who buy them.

             Possible. But how do you explain the good vid on the location of the kill room?
            </p>
            <p>
             Maybe he's an insider and that's why he can do a good "hang -out" ?
            </p>
            <p>
             Doesn't appear so, they choose more polished actors for their ops.
            </p>
            <p>
             Also, Kevdude recently responded to a post of mine. 
He's been working like all engines on , so he could just be resting?

            Of course this is fake/set-up, the fact that he claims he called with Alefantis says enough, not even to mention he claims he was actually threatened by him... Why in the world would Alefantis do this, if it would not benefit him?

             Psychopaths don't have to make sense. 
Especially protected ones.
            </p>
            <p>
             And Aleph is protected as everyone should well know.
            </p>
            <p>
             I don't watch TV but didn't he get on TV with some major talking head?
            </p>
            <p>
             It's all how it is framed to the public,
And Aleph is framed as a victim. 
So the entire public, and half of VOAT itself are primed to see Aleph as a victim, of stalkers and crazy people
            </p>
            <p>
             Why wouldnt he want to give the "interviewer" his mind? 
He has nothing to lose. Honestly.
            </p>
            <p>
             What I don't get is how that guy thought he could call him up after making that video.

             Yeah it seems insane to do that, but if he is insane, as in, he's a sociopath with connections to, and dirt on, the most powerful people in the world, then I can see how he would do something like that. Sociopath/narcissists do terrible things and can be very clever, but they also take huge risks and can act stupidly and rashly when threatened or feeling like their ego is being hurt. And if he is what everyone is thinking he is, then it's very possible he has high confidence that law enforcement are on his side, that he would be able to wiggle out of anything if it came to light that he'd threatened someone. I mean, already everyone on here are basically calling it fake news, so what chance does a story like that have with the rest of society, especially with the fake news priming?
            </p>
            <p>
             I'm not saying it's not fake, but I think it seems genuine and I think it shouldn't be dismissed so quickly. This guy who said he talked to JA has been involved in this for a long time, why would he fake something like this? what does it achieve? It's not like it would sell him many more pizza gate t-shirts. He hasn't faked anything or come out with any dodgy information before.

            I think he's genuine. I just think he's naive. You don't respond to a narcissist the way he did. He got submissive and Alefantis loved the power. I don't care about him selling shirts right now. The point is what's going on. I believe him and I feel bad for him

             I believe him too. He seemed genuine, I've seen videos of his before and he always seemed genuine, and he did seem afraid. Also, the conversations were too natural in my opinion, to be faked. They included too much confusion/misunderstandings, lapses where responses to one question came after other questions had been asked - that kind of step response thing you get sometimes when one person is replying as the other is still typing, as in, it's not like I say something, then you say something. Fake conversations almost always follow the Me: say something You: respond.ask Me: respond. You: response. etc. Natural conversations by text more often get kind of out of sync, like theirs did sometimes in these messages.

              Acting is hard. Crisis Actors are always shitty.
This guy is not a professional actor, just a good researcher who got in too deep.. Over his head.

              Yeah I agree. I don't think he's going to get on there and cause all of this attention and piss off JA. He's had to deal with people calling him names and being rude. Why do all that knowing you're putting yourself in danger if your just tricking us? He's been helping investigate. I think he's kind of innocent and naive. I mean he gave his full name! He gave his voat profile username. I just don't think he's used to dealing with really bad people and didn't know how to handle it once it got too far. Now everyone is telling him what to do in all different directions.

            Right, to edit the name and profile picture, you have to right click and inspect those and replace the content with something else.  I did it with "Somebody's Name" in my example screenshot.

             Perhaps in digging up Pegasus, Alefantis now has little choice but to become the fall guy for the elites.

            <p>
             This might be why the MSM keep busting out fake news about how debunked this is, and how it's all centered on one pizza shop. That way, when it all goes down, they can all distance themselves to just pile on what a horrible person Alefantis is, and how he duped so many people who had "no idea".

              What I am trying to say is that profiting off of a movement against child pedophilia seems immoral. I'm not saying the actual shirt 'PizzaGate' is immoral.

               I don't care about the morality of selling things related to current events (I actually like anything that draws attention to the case, even if it's seeing a t shirt on someone), but I'm more concerned about the ethics of a participant in selling things.  If you are an active poster/amateur researcher, then once you introduce profit there becomes a clear conflict of interest.   Takes away credibility a little in my eyes

            <strong>
             this isn't proof
            </strong>
            . In 30 seconds I reproduced this by right clicking the name on a chat window in facebook, clicking Inspect Element, and then editing the url that the link goes to. That link stays the same even if you click Home, because the chat window is not reloaded.

            He needs to do a livestream and prove it in multiple different ways suggested on the fly by other trusted people here. That would convince me. If it's worth that much effort to prove this. But if we can't prove it, it's not really much use to us.

             Have him open a new browser, nuke settings and all caches within the browser, completely exit, then restart said browser and log into Facebook (he can blur his email on that screen). Then, open the nefarious chat and click Alefantis's name.

              No, you can fake anything on a web browser with javascript (bookmarklet, plugin, etc.). He would need to give his FB password to a trusted third-party and have him login in and check, OR he would have to log into a trusted third-party computer (through VNC or whatever) and access his FB through there (the computer admin would be recording the desktop session).
             </p>
             <p>
              The issue is one of trust. You cannot trust someone who speaks on YT, nor can you trust a computer you don't control. You could trust code, but you can't look at the code running on the guy's computer. You could however trust a third-party, who would have to be involved in the verification. That's the only way IMO without FB involvement (which would anyway also be a third-party).
             </p>
             <p>
              Faking this would be a good way to publicize his t-shirts. But the value of his shirts come from the funny catch phrases he came up with (which you can copy and easily make/order your own shirts with). Plus he found/published that museum kill room stuff. So my two cents is he's telling the truth. If he's a shill, he's not good at his job.

              Just follow the steps I suggested.  Here's a tutorial for the Inspect tool:

             </p>
             <p>
              Here's what it looks like in this case:

              (If people really wanted I could make a pair of fake facebook accounts and do this myself on video, but I don't want to give away my identity.)

                Sorry, I acknowledge the link to his profile.  I'm not saying that the profile was fake.  I'm just saying I can easily edit the link in the chat box to point to whatever profile you want.  Same with the name and image on the chat box, if you wanted to.
               </p>
               <p>
                Right click the link, click Inspect, and you see this:
                <a href="http://sli.mg/0TAgTw.png">
                 http://sli.mg/0TAgTw.png
                </a>
                You can edit that url to point to whoever's profile you want, and then do what he did in his proof video.
               </p>
               <p>

                 You're not understanding. You cannot archive a fake profile because of Inspect Element. That's what I'm proving. Also, I'm only angry 'cause I've seen you several times now continually insisting this point; it is erroneous though. Surely you can see my suspicion. Hope this is elaborated.

                  When he made the video, the profile had not been deleted yet, presumably.  I'm not saying the james.alefantis profile is fake.  I'm saying it's easy to edit the link in one of your chat boxes in facebook to point to whatever profile you want, and thus do what he did in his proof video, even if you weren't actually chatting with that profile.

                   Hopping on the bandwagon to confirm this can be done. This isn't questioning the profile, it's questioning if he cleverly modified data under Inspect Element to fool us into thinking he spoke with the real JA.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   This said, the profile deletion can't be a coincidence, either. I'm leaning towards "trust, but verify" on this one, personally, and keep looking for ways this could still be an increasingly clever hoax.

                    Well it seems the james.alefantis profile is back up now.  I wonder how long it was down for.  Do we have an archive link to prove that it was actually taken down temporarily?

                    Good point, the fact that the facebook profile was apparently deleted immediately after he posted that proof video would indicate that
                    <strong>
                     someone
                    </strong>
                    is watching this discussion and reacting to it.  Whether it was Alefantis who deleted it, or someone else who hacked it to be redirected, I don't know.

                   Thanks for further elaborating, now that I can agree upon. However, one or the other would have already had to initiate conversation and exchange at least bits of dialogue to further edit them. Point being, they still actually conversed.

                    Except, he could have the chat with any facebook profile -- i.e. he could create a fake profile with the same name and profile photo, do both sides of the chat himself, and then edit this link for the proof video.  That would only take a few minutes to do.

You would have never admitted it, and I might never have actually interviewed you, but if the evidence looks exactly the same as in the video, then the community is going to believe me.

                        No, no, no. I'm saying that he could be in a weird scenario. Remember that the CIA overthrows democracies, and the shills are highly paid to focus on derailing the investigation. They have money, technology, and training.

                        I don't understand why we would allow investigators to make claims without proof.

                         Yes I agree proof would be best, but I think that this guy is believable, in my opinion, and I think it would be wrong to completely dismiss him and say you have no proof therefore you're lying. We aren't a court of law and we don't need hard evidence, we can say, well there's always the possibility that it's fake, but because I'd rather accidentally believe someone who was making this up than dismiss someone who was terrified and had done something a bit silly and had no idea what to do and was hoping that by telling the community they'd have some protection, I'm going to choose to believe him and give him support.

           </p>
           <p>
            There is nothing wrong with violence when properly channeled.  For example self-defense.  Are you suggesting that all Pizzagate investigators should be whimpy wallflowers who will offer no resistance in the face of an assault?
           </p>
           <p>
            Sorry, chap.  That's not for me.  I am well studied in Violence and it's lawful and proper applications.  And I would suggest that you all do likewise.  These are not peaceful people we are dealing with here. Wake up

            armyseer is shilling hard. If you guys can't see it, you're fucking idiots. He has literally only tried to debase threads and attacked anything that is actually tangible in relation to Pizzagate.

            In order for GoT conversation with JA to have been faked, you would have to accept that JA WANTS people to look harder into Pegasus. That is absolutely so damned improbable. WHY? Why would he want researchers looking harder into his properties???

              Maybe someone is after these people and framed them.
But then how do you explain the artwork collected over many years? 
How do you explain Rodham Clinton's loss as a predicted result by the same entities claiming responsibility for leading the emails?

             if he knows there is nothing there, of course he would want you to look hard at it, so you don't look at some other place, or person.
It's like cards. Which card do you play first? Poker, bridge or any game -- if you have more than one game to play, you don't always need to start by revealing your strategy.

              You know there's nothing to fear from someone looking in your garage, right? (let's hope, anyway)
Do you want the world to believe that you're hiding something of great consequence in your garage? No, of course you don't.

            The Alefantis texts seem to confirm the content of the phone calls, though. It definitely seems that Alefantis started out by threatening and only became more reasonable after he found out that Ryan was amenable to taking down the video in question.

                Well what he did was leave the prefix covered and did a phone lookup and it came back as JA. So that shows the phone number he claims is actually James alefantis number.

                  You do realize if he showed the full number (and especially if genuine) he would be wiped off the face of Youtube for giving it out? Further, that the full number could get us nuked the way Reddit excused their nuking PG there?

            I'm going to watch this one more time but how do you explain him not recording this?  Is he playing along with this? Are we 100% it's his real facebook?

            I had this thought also. The other thought I had was that I would 100%, 10/10 would bullshit you about having or not having that recording. I'd be so full of shit it would be a laxative company's crowning achievement to clear me out.

             Any chance he was instructed by "someone" (cops, Alefantis himself, FBI, etc.) to say he couldn't get a recording? After all, we're dealing with people who will probably unplug and BleachBit everything if the risk of jail outweighs lost profits. Not that they haven't already been doing that, but there's an awful lot of panic from someone if they've already "sanitized".
            </p>
            <p>
             Another possibility also crossed my mind--could Alefantis be positioning himself (intentionally or under duress from others) to be their fall guy? Oh, look, Pizzagate was kinda real, but the sweet, innocent Clintons had no idea about James! How awful of him to engage in such things!

             I agree. No calls for violence here. The most extreme thing anyone connected with Pizzagate seems to have done is tippy toe up the back stairs to Besta Pizza.

            <p>
             The way I see it Pizzagate is a collective research project, not a posse.

            Ok maybeee I can understand for some reason you didn't record it the first time and that is a big maybe but the SECOND time? I'm having a real hard time with this. You did all this investigative work and didn't record him threatening you.

             So, there is the possibility that he was advised by the police not to broadcast that he recorded it.
            </p>
            <p>
             But, assuming that is not the case, then I think there is something suspicious about it. Before he called him the first time, he said that he thought "oh my god, should I get some recording software for my phone?” So it did occur to him to record it...
            </p>
            <p>
             I get that, the first time, he was under pressure to call him within the 10 seconds. But, the second time, he had plenty of time to think it over, and had just heard 2+ minutes of ranting and threats to his life and his loved ones. He said that he was really scared, but doesn’t express much remorse or regret for not recording the calls (first one, a bit. Second one, none at all)? Wouldn't anyone of a reasonable nature, after a traumatic experience like that, feel shaken and regretful about not recording it... and be kicking themselves mentally &amp; emotionally for not capturing this evidence, which is of a huge and personal nature?
            </p>
            <p>
             He has created videos documenting the evidence of Pizzagate on Youtube, and so is not new to the Pizzagate investigation. I presume that he knew that people have died investigating Pizzagate, and knew the importance of gathering evidence. He stated this before the first call and yet, didn't think to record the second? Which also contained a death threat - “he assured me that I would die if I didn’t take this video down.”

And went back to talk more.

             And really, is Alefantis so stupid that he would threaten the lives of someone's family without knowing whether or not the stranger on the phone is recording the conversation? I don't think so. Alefantis is no idiot. He's probably a psychopath, and they are endowed with intelligence and cunning.

              That part doesn't bother me. 
Aleph set love to do FEATS. 
He could just say he was joking and the guy was stalking him , and they would let it go.
             </p>
             <p>
              Also, it's against the law to record someone unless you inform them.
So Aleph had all that covered.

             Thank you for being sceptical.
There were a few things that didn't fit.
He was not wondering, how Alefantis got the pics of his girlfriend and mother.
He received a death threat.
That is enough for everyone, to go to police. Blackmail with illegally aquired photos by Alefantis?
Police would instruct, how to call him once more and what to say, to make him repeat the threats. But this guy is not interested at all to involve law enforcement...
            </p>
            <p>
             And finally: after receiving death threats torwards himself, his mother and gf, he doesn't forget to advertise his pizzagate-shop...

              The police are just going to say, One person's word against another. That's how it goes.

                I think money and support would be important at that moment. 
I would need $200 at least to buy a bullet proof vest.

                And I would deserve it for the work I did, for zero pay.
               </p>
               <p>
                Also, I would not call the police - since I already know what they would do. 
It's one person's word against another, and the whole society is on the side of Aleph.
               </p>
               <p>
                The police have already shown they are protecting him.
               </p>
               <p>
                If you called the police they would come and arrest you for harassment.

              I don't think going to the police with the death threat is the best idea... All law enforcement agencies are compromised.

              Yeah, I found the last bit a bit disconcerting. He switches emotions rapidly - from pleading, almost begging us to not go… to then becoming light-hearted and smiling, and in an apparently genuine way.

             <p>
              “Check out pizzagategeaer.com. Look at my shirts” and then “keep up the good fight.” It's interesting, because just a few moments before, he said  “Do not go to this location… this isn’t our fight. This isn’t our battle.” He conveys that we should place our trust in law enforcement agencies instead... Well, have they been shown to be trustworthy so far? (Remember James's text, “the FBI liked your videos?”)

              Well, he was talking to the guy on Facebook, so presumably JA got the pictures from his Facebook profile or from googling his name. I don't think he can be written off quickly just because he mentioned his shop at the end. The interactions do not look faked to me, because there are misunderstandings and bits where someone asks a question, then asks another or says something else before the other person responds to the first question, so it looks a bit out of sync in places, like how happens with real conversations. I'm not sure he would have thought to include little details like that if making up a whole conversation.

               I agree, that the interactions really looked convincing. Especially the behaviour of "Alefantis". But after so many years learning to develop a sense for implausible "news", the alarm went on and therefore I can not trust this youtuber.

               This could be an act involving more than one person. There could be another person playing James's role, and as such, that would account for the lack of sync. So in a way, it is a real conversation.
