            The whole mass media apparatus is corrupted. That includes any of the major alternate news sites. If we could really rely on any of them to report or investigate this, then we wouldn’t be here. In a way, the small you tubers and the boaters have far more freedom to investigate. We can say and ask whatever we want here. Obviously Alex Jones does not have that luxury. IMHO, they attacked his wallet. They slapped him with some kind of injunction or gag order along couple million dollar lawsuit. Most indie news outlets couldn’t handle the constant motions and legal mambo jumbo that goes along with that. If I were Jones, I would be choosing my battles. Anybody that is red pilled isn’t going to just stop and turn around because of media gatekeeping or limited hangouts. We’re here to stay until they do the perp walks. Jones knows that. I don’t watch him much, but I think he may still be useful. Even though he pissed off a bunch of people here, he has still exposed a lot. I’m not counting him out yet.

            Jones a shill and controlled opposition?
Don't know.
Maybe... maybe not.
You never know...
But, of course, he has his agenda.
           </p>
           <p>
            I will always have to thank him for having played a big role in my very own awakening and redpilling.
Watched 'Endgame' many years ago... and his Bohemian Grove Stuff.
Massive eyeopener.
           </p>
           <p>
            BUT - he never was my 'guru'. I am not a blind follower of anyone.
Just collecting useful information where I find it.
           </p>
           <p>
            If Jones does not believe in PG, I might wonder why...  (shill, blackmailed, just angry he did not discover first,  just not believing , special tactics...)
But , who cares?
           </p>
           <p>
            As I am believing in PG I am moving on - hoping that this massive influencer some day will change his mind.

            Guys, we have seen The Cabal infiltrate in child services and foster homes. We have seen that captain Kouba who likes to chase children with Podesta works as a Counselor for Victims of Abuse for the USA army (with studies in Forensics). Do you think having a key person in the media opposition is any different? They had to sacrifice that pawn to put put a seal to Fake News. Dont let them bring that pawn again.

            We are not stupid. Alex Jones is them, he showed his true colors when the truth was revealed.

            The deletion of the forced(?) apology is something to celebrate, not condemn. Dude exposed Bohemian Grove on film.

            I can't believe you lot can turn on each other so much all the time.  I have said so many times, I am not Alex Jones biggest fan, BUT he has done sooooooo much more
            <strong>
             FOR
            </strong>
            the pizzagate cause than
            <strong>
             AGAINST
            </strong>
            the pizzagate cause/exposure.  Please focus on the real enemy and stop trying to crucify someone who is exposing these sickos to millions of people!  It is not about whether we like some one or not its about getting this message out to as many people as possible, and hes doing that.  If INFOWARS was shut down, the  pizzagate cause would suffer greatly and it would take longer to help all these children!  Remember why we are doing all this. The goal is to see these people locked up and nowhere near out children! I cannot believe I have to keep reminding people, If anyone is not actively against us then we can assume they are for us!

             Agreed. Sheep who've never before heard of Bohemian Grove still quote Alex Jones as proof of its existence on CDAN Blinds.  Then "hmmm" reveals what the elite politicians and business leaders of the world are really doing.  Notice CDAN Blinds have changed from mostly fluff to far, far more revealing info about pizzagate.
            </p>
            <p>
             CDAN Blinds when they're exposing the top elite pedos all get re-copied on Jezebel and LipstickAlley as well as DataLounge.  Yes that leads to even more revealing info from both CDAN and BlindGossip.
            </p>
            <p>
             Yes the later gossip site also wants the increased traffic. Same with Bossip. I've noticed Alex Jones mentioned on these sites now. They have never faced charges of made up info. Both sites are read by a young teen audience who worship celebs.

              You are right to be upset at Jones...he fucked us bad...but if he is actually a Jew Puppet is not totally clear yet.  There are legit questions.....sometimes I feel you are correct.  Time will tell.

              Insult away thats not helping anyone least of all the children.  As I have said before how many millions of people have you managed to make aware of pizzagate? At least Alex Jones has.  Yes I am a Christian, if that is so offensive to you, I wonder why? I wouldn't class myself as a fundamentalist lol but obviously being a Christian is a threat in someway that you have to try insult or discredit me. (by the way, trying to insult a Christian by calling them a Christian, is really a complement, thank you 😍 )   I just do not see the point, if we are genuinely interested in helping expose these sickos, in attacking people trying to do the same thing.  It just doesn't make sense.  Its like scoring and own goal, and the children get nothing from it and we get further away from our goal.  Would you prefer Alex Jones/INFOWARS got shut down? - Depending on your first thought response will tell you a lot. Have a good day, I know I will 🤗

               Thank you. I don't know why this site always ends up with a racist, anti-Semitic attack by the same few posters. Every time in the past child abuse has been brought up in the media, and I'm talking about the "Satanic panic" era, it ended up being sidelined over who runs Hollywood.
              </p>
              <p>
               As I've already pointed out it's those who FINANCE films, getting favors at Cannes et al, and the ones who hire the music performers for private performances, which determine the content. Of course even more important re the pedophilia apparent in Disney and other films are the Luciferian elite behind the scenes.
              </p>
              <p>
               Again today I referred to GOAT, posters confessing anonymously on another site of experiencing childhood sexual abuse, during a discussion of what happens at the top levels of Masonry. Thousands of people all over the world read those posts. I'd hate for them to start reading posts on GOAT and get turned off by the racism, or get distracted by Stormfront-type rhetoric. Politics discussions is also a total distraction from the real issue, stopping pedo behavior everywhere in the world.

                 I hope to God you are right.  There was a post about a suicide from Hillary's Camp.  Something involved with a deal with Boeing and Russia.  This is getting interesting.  Possibly many will be jumping or committing suicides with bullets to the back of their heads.  What a Time.

            Jones spent at least an hour today talking Soy - Soy &amp; estrogen - it's effects upon Testosterone - how it is a deliberate attack.

             Without a single voice of dissent 700 billion, 25% more than even Trump demanded!?! WTF?!
It's important, but why no peep from Infowars about the military budget?
            </p>
            <p>
             Did you notice, that Trump is expanding the war in Africa. No word from Jones about Trump bombing even more than Obama, if Jones is really anti-globalist?
            </p>
            <p>
             No word from Jones about troops on the ground in Syria, too.
            </p>
            <p>
             Jones is also silent about the Saudi-Israeli-conspiracy to incite war against Syria and Iran.
            </p>
            <p>
             Telling 95% truth but omitting the most important 5% works, too!
            </p>
            <p>
             It becomes more and more clear, that Jones is a limited hangout and that the big jewish sponsoring companies of Infowars know, why they support Jones.
By looking what Jones does, these days it becomes clrearer: bashing the globalists strongly and therefore make sure Israel and the Jewish media running the USA are not discussed.
            </p>
            <p>
             It also fits to his strange ignorance of the hugely important Saudi-Israeli-conspiracy and why he stays silent about Trump breaking his camaign promises of less foreign involvement. And it also fits that Jones is silent about the scandalous 700 bn $ budget without a single voice of dissent. The USA seems to prepare for wara nd Jones remains silent.
            </p>
            <p>
             But instead discusses SOYBOYS...

              Your argument is weak - that comes from consuming soy.

             <p>
              I recommend you stop.  Find some nice grass fed beef and eat that instead.  Your argument will improve.

              Meanwhile do read the labels on your supermarket foods - try to not eat soy - watch what happens to your food purchasing patterns.  You might find that interesting.

              I've stated in other threads/posts on GOAT that Monsanto is the proven source of the problem. Their chemical pesticides like Altrazite and Glycophenate have been proven in Scientific Studies to reduce the number of bees in the US, turn male frogs into female frogs, and interfere with testosterone production. Sweden which makes the sprays will not allow its use. Neither will many other countries in the world.
             </p>
             <p>
              No organic produce isn't safe either as Monsanto's products leach into all of the groundwater in the USA as well as the air.
             </p>

              That said, anyone who monetizes on YouTube is going to be restricted on what they say. Therefore they must narrow their topics and who they expose.
             </p>
             <p>
              Even those that have stopped monetizing have narrowed their scope of what they're willing to expose. Otherwise they will overwhelm, and then turn off their audience. Sheep trying to be informed will interpret it as, "everything in the world is bad." That means in their minds, "nothing at all can be done to make things better on Earth, and we must wait for the return of the Messiah."

               You sound very knowledgeable, its a shame to have to waste your time trying to educate these people who have closed minds and who are really on here to try and confuse people.  Pray that someone on voat who genuinely wants to know the truth you are sharing will come across this and inadvertently the critics or dis info people will have helped someone visiting 🙏🏻☝🏻 btw Nice user name choice!

             I was sceptical about the claims, because IMO he brought up too many important topics.
But these days a Zionist agenda of Jones became clear:
            </p>
            <p>
             Geopolitics is hugely important. Jones discusses it all the time.
And he stays silent about the Israeli-Saudi-conspiracy to ignite war against Iran...
            </p>
            <p>
             Jones claims to be libertarian.
But he stays silent about Trump even more bombing other countries than Obama.
            </p>
            <p>
             Jones claims to be against the evil deep state and the MIC.
Anf then he is silent about a 700 BN $ military budget passed without a single voice of dissent! LOL. 25% MORE than even Trump wanted!
USA with a war budget but not a peep from Jones... Trump, a president for the people?

             I agree. The false flag at Comet was pretty clever. It worked well. And the AJ apology kinda sealed the deal. Any sheep that had one eye open went back to sleep after that. Ben Swann gaves us a little resurgence of energy, but for the most part, the sheep stayed put. Baaaa.

              The false flag was not clever it was a tried and true Jew tactic.  I mean if your tribe owns every major media in the Western World you could get away with ?  It is what they do.  They bribe and black mail governments to giving over the natural right to issue their own currency to a tribe that taxes the Goyim for the right to make their own money.  To make that Jew trick work they have to have almost total control of the media......so Fox News wouldnt be owned by a Jew right?   Next step to total control....one Jew Billionaire funds the Democraps....and for shit sake.....two Jew Billionaires fund the Republikans.....and for good measure the Jew presents themselves as the saviors of the Blacks........but for shits and giggles....lets make sure the abortion centers are all located in the Hood........
             </p>
             <p>
              The Jews like no one.......figure it out.  They like puppets....they like your kids butt holes....why?  Because it is what they do.....Jews are the opposers....they go through life destroying what they find.....
             </p>
             <p>
              They would rather reign in hell than serve in heaven.....but one problem with fucking over the entire world.............
             </p>
             <p>
              when the Goyim wake up?   You have no friends.......no where to run to.......and lots of ways to get even.

                 Dude. I agree with that... In fact, That's virtutally the entire problem I have with him.... that being said, He still helps Us.... he's still correct virtually always... He's still winning. Him winning is us winning... Mayve you and I , don't understand how His sensationalized delivery helps us.... well, Not maybe... we dont understand... But maybe its being done that way for a reason.... OR MAYBE you and I are right... and he would do better if he didnt do that... But the point is... He helps us way more than he hurts us. that's simply not debatable.

              LOL how do you not see that Jones and Trump are in on the whole thing? They are playing the part of the enemy, the crazy conspiracy guys. ALL politicians are the enemy of the people, because at this point they are ALL blackmailed and controlled. BOTH sides you idiot, BOTH sides! Drop this "Trump is gonna save us" shit, because it's pathetic. Trump is busting low-level pedos here and there, OOOOOOOOH WOWWWWWWW. Big fucking deal. He is completely aware of "The Big One" and he doesn't go after them either because A. he's part of it, or B. they're too big for him to stop. TRUMP IS NOT GOING TO BRING DOWN THE INTERNATIONAL PEDO RING, HE IS NOT GOING TO EXPOSE SATANISM TO THE MASSES. And THOSE are the two big things that need to be done. So fuck off with your crazy pro-politician BULLSHIT. REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE.

                I imagine that you also believe most of what Alex Jones says, and you probably follow Cernovich and all of the "Alt Right" guys, right? You're barking up the wrong tree with me, man, because I do not trust ANY political figures. Hang them all from trees, that'd be a good start to fix the problem.

                I'm not a shill idiot. I work in a tech support office and have been following PizzaGate ever since Alefantis' IG pictures were leaked. I've believed PG from day one. But I've also always thought that Trump is one of (((them))). He may call himself Catholic but he still in bed with the Luciferian Jewish Mafia.
               </p>
               <p>
                I just hate how defensive people get over Trump. He's a fucking man. A flesh and blood man with flaws and bad qualities. He's not God, he's not a deity, he's not even a Saint. He's a sleazy New York businessman straight out of the movie "Wall Street" with Charlie Sheen. He's not a fuckin' hero. And it just sucks that so many people on this board think he's gonna save the fucking day.

              I was very distraught when Jones tucked tail on Pizzagate....I always felt some one with a T in his name called him up and "suggested" he slow down.....
             </p>
             <p>
              There is a very weird story about the apology that I am sure will come out someday.
             </p>
             <p>
              I hated Jones then...but have heard stories that the chess masters thought the American People couldnt just be presented with stories of our top politicians raping and cooking and eating children.  I think they decided on a slow reveal plan....I think they first are getting us used to the idea that thousand of people we were told were great people are monsters....I think things are being revealed toooo slow.  But I am starting to see the outlines of a real strategy that might just work.
             </p>
             <p>
              But no one is beyond questioning.....NO ONE.  Keep up your guards....pressure everyone even people we hope are honest.  Hopefully Jones will explain the whole thing one day while we all pop champane bottles at the news of another Jew/Mason Luciferian being slowly cooked alive.

              </p>
              <p>
               But  I honestly haven't really thought about the apology too much. I wrote it off to Protecting himself... WHICH I TOTALLY UNDERSTAND, And do not condemn him for.  If he some how got fucked By that, It would be a Huge blow to this movement despite

               's profound proclamation.
              </p>
              <p>
               But then when you think about it- I can't see HOW he would get fucked... Because I mean, It's not like Alefantis could have won In court... So maybe he was getting credible threats of Physical harm to him or his family.... I have no fucking clue.

               <strong>
                what I do know Is that alex jones Is correct-Often. I know he's woken millions of people, Regardless if I think he could have woke more, Had he done things differently... I also Know,  that He also Knows a lot more than most us. So I gave him the benefit of the doubt, regarding this apology, from the get go.  Because Frankly- He's earned it.

              <p>
               As far as you thinking things are being revealed too slowly... I totally Understand. I often times catch mysaelf thinking the same thing... But usually I'm able to remind myself that A year ago- I didn't think NEARLY as much would have been accomplished in such a short period of time.

               I also try to Realize that we are being desensitized to Things that are "crazy as fuck" happening.... Like For anyone that's been in a coma that last 2 years, and Is now literally waking up... They would be able to fully appreciate how much has happened- And that rate at which it has happened. But I can't. Because I, along with many, have been numbed by the craziness unfolding daily over the last 2 years.

                Ask yourself why Podesta has used Jones apology so many times as an argument and calls him "our man" while he posts his absurd apology as if that was an argument against all the blatant evidence against him. That apology was perfectly sinchronized with a False Flag incident in Comet and the creation of the Fake News label. It was all part of the same operation to debunk Pizzagate and all of us have to have enough memory to always remember it.

             He could be controlled.  It does fit a pattern.  But I have a theory that the value of contolled opposition is to "spin away" from the most dangerous areas.....his whole "pizzagate": is fake but the politicans really are blackmailed by the Mossad/CIA/MI6 Zionist cabal....is an odd way to go about it.  I feel T told him to go slower.   But time will tell.  If Alex is Controlled Op......he will meet his own special kind of doom.
