<p>So excited if this is true! If I\'m right, MOAB is someone unimpeachable and the press would not DARE tear her apart -- not after what she\'s been through so let me get to the tweet that set this off. </p>

<p>I thought it was a pretty interesting theory, too, so I went dumpster diving for who it could be. In order to do that, I had to find out what the hell MOAB was. It had to have something to do with TV or filming. So I found out MOAB is a place in UTAH!!! </p>

<p>Then I spotted MOAB Happenings that discusses films/videos/TV filmed there! I was getting hot!</p>

<p>I then did a search for TV filmed in MOAB nominated for Emmys. It\'s here I got even hotter. First, there was WESTWORLD!!!! Westworld is filmed in MOAB: </p>

            May not mean anything but I thought this was interesting. Look up the book Trumpet by Bill Hayes on Amazon. I can't link cause of banned domains message.  He is a soap star, and has been for decades. He is 92 now. It does contain some real historical history in the book.

               was wrong so often. And now this ... I refuse to lie and make something fit. Nothing does.

               was wrong. And what I especially didn't like is his/her backing away. The last barrage of remarks were underwhelming when May was touted as being spectacular. Not sure what's going on. Will still read the posts and see what else comes. up. But then the other thing is, Trump has twice drawn a Q. Why would he do that? It could be he's just cheering him/her on without validating Q, but it seems pretty odd that our POTUS would do that for no reason.

               I do feel more energy on our side. I feel we're winning, but I was praying for something HUGE ... you know, to bolster the spirits and at least get some more people red-pilled. Oh, well! Hard to know what to do sometimes, but I have not lost my faith in all of you. The pizzagaters I've met through this board and other places are the best. And the warriors on the front lines of Twitter are spectacular. Those comments ... hope someone is saving/archiving. Amazing!

                I'm an optimistic person most of the time but, sometimes I just wonder if it will all come to light. At least more people are awake to the evil and more willing to believe it exist. You know I like to keep the humor going to counter the bad stuff. Don't know if you've seen this of Randy Quaid doing Trump witch hunt but, here it is for you in case you haven't. If anyone knows about the "star whackers", it's him. He knows how the cabal can ruin you. I love this crazy f'er.

            I think the MOAB will be the texts between the FBI agents.  Oh!  It you go to Qanon.pub, scroll to the bottom, there are 'answer' links that open boxes with answers to Q's questions.  Some very interesting reading...

             What would that have to do with the red carpet? And As the World Turns? And Day &amp; Time? = Daytime, no? Daytime Emmy Awards? That's what Elizabeth Smart is nominated in.

             The texts between the FBI agents are significant. The hints at there being talk of assassination is disturbing IF it proves to be true.

            <p>
             Until then?  Conjecture.

              The Elizabeth Smart story was probably fake. Everything they do is fake. TV is a demon. I know, I’ve met that demon and have talked to it. Good grief TV is nothing but fakeland!!!

               I did see something though. It was a long time ago. Maybe an investigative report? It's why I thought the police purposely botched the investigation.

             I was raised catholic and left the faith very young. I didn’t begin believing in a higher power again till 02’ but more in a general way and not specifically Catholicism. Flash forward to now and how crazy everything is and I decided to read Revelations again. I own a late 1800’s copy and it clearly states that the Jews are the synagogue of Satan. It mentions pedofilia (doesn’t use that word), cannabalism, and other far too coincidental details such as the unmasking of the Jews.

              Jewish people are not the synagogue of Satan. That too is coded. The Book of Revelation is all coded. Revelation 2-3 is talking about the Christian Church and not Jews. The synagogue of Satan is the Laodicean Church in Revelation 3. To make this real plain to you so you understand. The Catholic Church you grew up in is part of the synagogue of Satan. You left it, that is a good thing.

               Probably true, but I do think Zionists and the Sabatai Zevi people are probably contenders for that role too.

             There is a demon that has a name of TV. I’ve seen it. Come on! Seriously, I don’t take nothing that happens on TV seriously. It would just be satan telling on satan—meaningless

             I was just thinking the same thing. If nothing happens, so be it. But the moment becomes more powerful when more people watch.

            Omg.. reading this sent literal chills down my spine... I do think that you are into something here... what do we know about her kidnapper? Could he have been a procure? Maybe he wanted to keep smart for himself? Would finding out that her kidnapper was involved in a bigger cabal be the catalyst to her speaking out about it? Would she risk so much for a group she wasnt personally connected to?  If so, what was serious enough for her to risk her life (assuming she would be exposing an elite sex trafficking syndicate)? Omg.. I can't tell if I am excited or ill...

             Yeah, the kidnapper ... the story ... it's insane. It's one of those stories where it was impossible to believe the police could be that inept. They were unwilling to do anything so the Smart family had to take the investigation into their own hands to get their daughter back. That included the sketch of the kidnapper. They were the ones to hire the sketch artist because the police wouldn't believe Elizabeth's younger sister was capable of giving a good description. It was because of the sketch and what she saw the family tracked this guy down. And even when the family told the police who they suspected, the police REFUSED to even talk to him! They fought saying they had no legal rights to question him? They could have ended that girl's torture months earlier and didn't so, yeah, based on that I would say that piece of shit  Brian David Mitchell and accomplice Wanda Barzee. They remind me so much of that stupid NXIVM in that she was helping him. Who would do that? Somebody that's as crazy as he is. And

             As for risk, I don't know what she's found -- if anything. It just didn't make any sense that the police stonewalled the family that way. Think Telford. So there has to be a big, big, HUGE story behind this.

               Have no idea. It's not what she says, but she was still being broken down. Maybe she wasn't ready ... or maybe they were saving her for a sacrifice or any number of things ... like a sex cult.

               All I know is that it's reasonable to assume the police were in on in. Have no proof, but if they weren't aiding and abetting they were fatally incompetent.

                 I'm hoping for something big this week. Hoping it's the Emmys because that's snowflake territory. If nothing goes down ... I mean anywhere ... it's another case of Q being wrong about the importance of this week. Would hate for that to happen. Seems some momentum has been created.

             Stopping the human trafficking, torture, rape, and abuse of children is not a false cause. Q is more the intermediary between our POTUS and our cause. For legal reasons, our POTUS is prevented from speaking the entire truth sooooo .... the intermediary takes over and fills us in. Think of him as a collective Guardian Angel.

               Debunked. Move on. I think shills repeating this ad nauseam shows how clean Trump is. It's like the pathetic Cannibal Queen and her jackals sticking with the dossier. They had to make something up and that's the narrative they stick to.

                While Trump could be a Blackmail victim and is now a puppet, he has lawful access to Martial Law  that can be used ONLY on National Security assets, both present and former holders and associates. For life, if one cares to read the Oath's fine print everyone has to sign.

                You are assuming that he is free to go against the deep state. A rather naive and innocent view on life. I wish I was this ignorant so life can be bliss.

                Are you sure??? Do a search for Presbyterian and crimes with Google. That’s what Trump is - a Presbyterian=he is a false Christian too. He could be fooling all of you just like all the rest

                  He is surrounded by false preachers so I rather doubt it. No, sorry Trump is as fake as they come. Could they be playing good cop bad cop? Could they make someone look this good to deceive people? I’ve studied this for over 35 years. People like Trump just don’t change, it is hard to change, very hard. He is all involved with the peace process with Israel, that is antichrist.

             That's how I originally took the meaning so we're thinking along the same lines. But when I read that tweeter's theory, I searched for something to specifically tie in with films, videos, etc. And really, it can have a double meaning. The mother of all bombs can be interpreted as a truth bomb. And MOAB is legitimately in Utah, which is where Ms. Smart resides.

             I agree.

            <p>
             Q is like magic. I used to sorta want to believe before I dismissed it as not working. Then I had that red-pill experience about our POTUS and there's no way I'm turning my back on him not being authentic. But the thing is, it doesn't mean the way people interpreting this -- and that would include me -- is the way he intended it to be taken. But it does fit. There isn't another person on the planet that could do what she's capable of doing.
            </p>
            <p>
             And fer shure, it'll settle it for a lot of people.

                I don't know. Wonder if that's the norm or are they doing it differently this year. I know The Talk usually does a recap of it.

             She's about the only one I can think of that would be able to come out of left field and red-pill everyone.
