            re: 'out of the box'
           </p>
           <p>
            What if acknowledging a 1000 year old world-controlling pedophile ring absolutely crashes the economy? What if all the low-level pedo busts have only been a small offering to 'demonstrate' that 'something is being done'?
           </p>
           <p>
            What if the FBI is not your friend? Would Trey Gowdy quit his job if he discovered the DOJ was fundamentally compromised?
           </p>
           <p>
            A new tactic is needed. An 'outside-the-box' response. Most people think they have the right to be 'average joe'. To act like they get their own lives, even though the institution of government, and therefore the taxpayer, has garnered fantastic debt.
           </p>
           <p>
            People don't know that the idea of vacations and retirements is abominably selfish. Many call themselves Christian, yet fall victim to the lie that glibly acts as if pride is a good thing.
           </p>
           <p>
            Jesus did not say "Forgive them for they know not what they do, except the really horrible ones."
           </p>
           <p>
            For justice to be done each person needs to prioritize truth above survival. You just don't know how every taxpayer is naively complicit in everything their taxes do. We have been brainwashed by people who were brainwashed and no one is to blame for this literal Hell we all find ourselves in.
           </p>
           <p>
            Offer the Satanists the reality of world peace. You have to know that there are so many that have their 'insurance'/whistleblower documents ready to go. The ritual pedos believe in the 'one gang' theory... a continuation of all the bad colonizing (re: raping all the native kids to crush the morale of an entire culture). A belief that anything is allowed as long as it leads to only one gang ruling the whole world. Then 'there will be peace on Earth', so they tell themselves.
           </p>
           <p>
            We were all lied to about free-will. All our lives we've told ourselves that the divining process is a choosing process, and it allowed for our belief in evil, subsequently controlling us via hate and panic.
           </p>
           <p>
            Analyze choice. Please. Vengeance is not a vehicle for peace.
           </p>
           <p>
            Patience be with us all. also you are literally an angel, just like everyone.

            Trump alluded to the need to combat net neutrality in his very human trafficking conference. Was something like "and with all that's going on on the internet..." At the time I read it for what it was, namely him paving the road for complete censorship of "fake news".
           </p>
           <p>
            I'm over believing Trump is going to do something about it. I think a bunch of paid shills and the donald, albeit unwittingly, helped promote this notion that Trump had any interest in draining the swamp. That's just campaign rhetoric and the fact that you're all so eager to eat it up and not view it as pandering to the populace makes me wonder if this is your first election. I figure Trump just knows how viral this is and doesn't want to be seen as complicit. I've been hearing from inside sources and anonymous leakers how major elite arrests will be happening in the next few weeks for months now. I grow weary of placing my faith in the executive branch. Guerilla tactics are what will prove most effective. Start practicing your graffiti, everyone! That's how it's going to be spread! On walls and bathroom stalls. And there's nothing wrong with that! Get the word out!

            Since when has Alex Jones become a credible force on here???? I am really really dumb founded. We KNOW he is nothing but a gate keeper. I don't give a flying Fuck what else everyone else has done it does not take away from James Alefantis being a PEDOPHILE.

            This whole thing was orchestrated to try to disrupt the March, including Edgar Welch pleading guilty with a secret plea deal, Jones issuing his apology and then David Seaman quits covering PizzaGate the next day...  We ALL knew there were CTR/Brock/Alefantis shills in our midst, why is everyone acting so surprised when they expose themselves?

            Lots of good info in the video and if we think about this entire thing rationally, we see that after the Podesta emails and the "pizza" weirdness, ALL OF A SUDDEN, the entire focus became Comet Pizza.  When you go back and look at the original work, it wasn't really even an issue.
           </p>
           <p>
            Alefantis may be a creep, but don't forget he was with Mr. Dirty Tricks, David Brock, who works for Hillary, so when the heat started to get focused on the "pizza" pedophile references in the emails, the Clinton Machine (their fake "investigators) MOVED our attention to Comet Pizza.  Maybe Brock did it to get back at ex-boyfriend Alefantis. Or maybe he was just a useful idiot. Then the Clinton Machine trolls started crafting a narrative that any pedophile connection
            <em>
             had
            </em>
            to link from or to Alefantis and Comet Pizza.  It was designed to drag us down a rabbit hole where the False Flag shooter/actor sealed our fate and made any further discussion of the Podesta "pizza" emails, conspiracy talk and reason to control the Internet.
           </p>
           <p>
            We need to focus on the larger issues that Cernovich and Alex Jones are discussing in the video.  BIG PICTURE now, and it is much bigger than a rat-hole restaurant in DC.  If something comes out new about Comet Pizza, like who are the children in those pictures and are they okay, fine. But if we stay on bigger picture, I think, we will be much more successful.

             Correct.
Remember what Anon on 4chan said from the very beginning? Focus on the Clinton foundation.
AJ, as one who has been fighting the globalist pedophile satanic network for more than twenty years(!!!), gladly has understood how counter-productive for redpilling people #pizzagate is. Nobody is being redpilled because of Comet Ping Pong or Alefantis being a chickenlover.
It began with the Podesta emails, Sillsby, Clinton, Epstein's Lolita Express, Spirit Cooking.
CPP and Alefantis was only a weak link and a result of further digging of already convinced people but is not suited to build public awareness, pressure for investigations. And it quickly has become the main target for shills, which do everything that Clinton Foundation, Saudi Arabia, proven child trafficking is kept out of the focus.

             Pay attention who attacks Jones here all the time - and payx attention which topics they are pushing. Then you begin to see, how harmful the development has been and how important is is, that AJ broke free from it.

              Alex has been fighting the globalist pedophile satanic network for more than twenty years??  He's done a really bad job, considering it's running rampant everywhere.  He is what you call a "Gatekeeper." He ensures that NOTHING ever gets done.

               Only a troglodyte could complain that Jones has been unable to single-handedly do what the Federal Government, FBI, CIA, NSA, DOJ, DOS, NSA, and Homeland Security cannot or will not do. What he has done instead is demonstrate almost daily for 22 years that the aforementioned are infiltrated at all levels and thus frequently serve to facilitate the very globalist pedophile satanic network you pretend to be concerned about.

                A troglodyte is a person who dwells in a cave. I thought I would post the definition because you have proven to be too lazy or incapable of conducting any research.

              Totally agree, micha. There is no reason for the anti-Jones hatred from some here.  Like him, don't like him, but save your anger for the pedophiles.  When you waste it on one of the ONLY media outlets covering any of this, then I doubt the sincerity.

               Alex supports pedophiles like James Alefantis and pedo-supporters like Milo.  I assure you I have enough anger for the pedophiles and their supporters.

               Not a Jones bot.  I'm a freethinker and my only agenda is to stop the pedophilia networks.  You can disagree about Comet Pizza, but the hatred and vitriol that you spew for anyone that wants to get past that, proves that either YOU have an agenda or YOU are a Clinton/Brock Machine Disinformation Troll.

                I didn't disagree about comet pizza pg is absolutely real 100% I don't know what you're talking about. My point is Jones is a fraud that taints every piece of real  information he produces. He acts like a lunatic on purpose it's painfully obvious and he does it to discredit what he says no matter how true it is. He's hypnotizing people on his tv broadcasts watch the swirling circles behind him and pay attention to the way he moves his hands and when he snaps his fingers. There will always be a divide with Jones at the helm After seeing Lucian Wintrich sitting on cernovichs lap and wintrich tweeting a picture of a naked  13 year old  maybe older slicing up a chicken.. Yeh no thanks. It's Jones that is playing a role. PG is  real Alex Jones is a fraud. You saying I'm a ctr shill for expressing my opinion that I believe Alex is a phony shows how little you know about how in control these people are. I find it funny to think so many people think a guy like Alex Jones can get that big without getting shut down eventually while the smallest of researchers that goes down the wrong hole get silenced. Ridiculous

            Alex Jones is a maddening combination of brave truth teller, font of inside information which eventually checks out, lunatic, careless purveyor of bad speculation, and supplements salesman.  One can basically append whatever you want onto him.  It's probably partially true.  Well-informed genius ahead of the curve or shirtless madman raging against the machine, either applies.

            AJ's early comments on CPP and JA were sloppy.  AJ flipped back and forth between giving great information and saying things which were sort of right with details botched, or just wrong, often due to confusing one thing or person with another.  And that's why his lawyers must have advised him to backtrack on CPP.
           </p>
           <p>
            But if I distill down AJ's take into a short summary and ignore his factual goofs, his basic point was this is a lot bigger than a pizza place in DC.  Can anyone disagree with that after following all this for months?
           </p>
           <p>
            And it's indisputable AJ is still trying to expose child trafficking.  So love him or hate him, I do both, he's going to keep doing his thing.  His latest stuff on Clinton and used-to-be Silsby was excellent.  So tomorrow he'll probably scream a lot and predict something transparently nuts.

            I really didn't like that he left Alefantis off the hook. But if I do like the increased coverage for pizza gate. I do like that he mentioned Bill and Hillary, and Laura Silsby and the whole Haiti thing. If this is the price of getting increased coverage, I am willing to put Alefantis on the side burner for a while.

            Guess it's time to speak in code like the CPP group.  I personally would like to offer the name Pork Rind for AJ.  I am still pissed at the timing of his crybaby apology right before the march.  Then the following Monday Pork Rind tells everyone to keep digging and its real.  Well obviously no major news reported any of that.  He just threw a lot of people under the bus. Keep hawking your male vitality Fat Boy but you just lost a loyal following.  You are no Wolfgang Halbig.  You have done nothing for any cause that you scream about with your fat, bloated face.  Brock had a heart attack, better lose some weight or you might be next.

What would you do if the lawsuit were timed with the disruption of $4,000,000 business income?

              He purposely timed that apology to destroy a march many people worked very hard to get into motion.  The anger is justified.  All that stuff he said on Monday could have been shortened and added to Friday's announcement that the media jumped on.  It was calculated and unhelpful to the cause.

                 It is a known fact that any news that comes out on a Fri. is what they HOPE is buried news, especially if it is a Friday afternoon!  It may not have been, as nefarious as some may think on timing... None of know AJ;s time constraints as to when his Atty;s or demands by JA were scripted and exactly WHAT it all entailed. Speculating does not reveal all of the TRUTH!!!

             Well, I know that with the open borders mass immigration policy lots of very frustrated muslims have flooded Europe. Not counting the millions offspring from previously imported muslims.
It's more the natural cause of 30 years bombing, destroying seeding chaos in muslim countries and open borders.

              This I much agree with.  Would we not be enraged if these things had been perpetrated upon us?  Also, the missing children of these people have disappeared forever.  I am sure they know what is going on. They may be homeless, but they are not stupid.

               They are even dumber than ppl in the West. Therefore the global elite wants the white West's middle class destroyed and replaced with camel riding muzzie proles.

             Nobody ever disputes the fact that Jones has talked about what elites do with children in their spare time, not a little bit, nor  passionately, but in fact rabidly, and
             <strong>
              more than any other media personality, living or dead,
             </strong>
             although David Icke would give him a run for the money. The reason this truth is never challenged is because it is inarguable by anyone who has ever listened to Jones with any regularity, especially in the past. Those that do not listen to the show or instead watch compilations made by others continue to get their talking points from people hell bent on destroying him, who produced all the Jones is gatekeeper/cointelpro/limited hangout/CIA/mossad asset material everyone falls for.
             <strong>
              Jones is the virtual Godfather
             </strong>
             of broadcasting the message that there is a global epidemic of child sex trafficking and slavery.
            </p>
            <p>
             In less than 60 seconds, I produced the following list of stories or videos from Infowars regarding Jones's Herculean efforts to bring this news to a broader audience in the last two decades:

             Were I to make a comprehensive list, I would need the equivalent of probably 10 full VOAT pages and perhaps seven hours of spare time to produce it.
            </p>
            <p>
             <strong>
              Anyone claiming Jones is a gatekeeper for people who commit unspeakable crimes against children is dead wrong.
             </strong>
             There are lots of reasons why someone might not like Jones, and I get it because Jones has certainly made mistakes in the past, but to make heinous claims that he is part of a coverup is an outrage.
            </p>
            <p>
             If inclined, I could spend ten more minutes and produce unassailable proof that Jones was set up by Alefantis in such a way as to give Jones no alternative than to retract, and show that Alefantis had admissible evidence against Jones that he did not have on any other well known personality talking about PG, and explain why Jones was the perfect foil or proxy to attack on behalf of you, me, DS, and just about every other person discussing PG, but I am not going to waste my time because the worst of you cowards will deny it to the death anyway.
            </p>
            <p>
             The evidence against those claiming Jones has done little for the child sex trafficking/slavery story, or worse, claim he's working those very entities so engaged, is devastating, and readily available to anyone who can read or use google.

              This is awesome. I saw a comment on another post where you directed people to come read this. You're right about this. I really don't think he was trying to put the apology out to take away from the protest. I just don't believe he would do that. He hates these satanic child molesters.

               You mean releasing his retraction somewhat after but perhaps before the second of two rallies that virtually half of PG people railed against and said would be insignificant or detrimental to the cause in thread after thread? Why don't you read some of the articles I linked and tell us exactly where Jones is incorrect. Actually, don't bother. You and your brethren never have any interest in the truth, so there's no likelihood this status will change even if you mustered the courage to do so. Here's an even better idea. Go start an alternative media platform, and spend twenty years showing Alex Jones how to really report on child sex trafficking/slavery.

                You mean the half that are CFR/Brock/Alefantis trolls?  The only comments I saw against the PG Rally was the fact that someone made a 2nd one (the first one) after the one on the 25th was already planned.  Talk about diversion tactics.  The rally on the 25th was targeted since it's inception and it's obvious to anyone that they pulled out all of the stops to try to stop it.
               </p>
               <p>
                I'm interested in the truth and justice.  That's why I was at the rally.

                 It doesn't change the fact that you are attributing great significance to the timing of the retraction, which is erroneous for many reasons including the fact that while the rallies were well intentioned (I defended you and other attendees ferociously in threads attacking the rally) they are of relatively minor importance because they are not going to directly lead to speedier arrests. The idea Jones timed his retraction to thwart you is preposterous.
                </p>
                <p>
                 Why are you and other people of like mind unwilling or unable to address the 800 pound gorilla in the room? The 800 pound gorilla is Alex Jones's unparalleled twenty-two year effort to tell the world that it's run by satanic child sex traffickers/torturers. Hell, I'd be willing to give serious and open consideration to the theories of any person making negative claims about Jones
                 <em>
                  if
                 </em>
                 they were willing to acknowledge the undeniable truth that Jones has devoted more broadcasting time to covering satanic child sex trafficking/torture than anyone living or dead, except perhaps David Icke. Admit it, and I assure you I will give fullest consideration to any other complaints.

              I watch him all the time. His retraction on James Alefantis was insulting and tragic.There are a few possible explanations but amongst them is not "James Alefantis is probably innocent" because that is untrue.

               hardly insulting unless you are referring to pedophile pimp Alefantis or child rapist Podesta insulting our intelligence. Since you are a regular listener then you already know that Google denied InfoWars access to an anticipated 4-5Million in advertisement fees. Google's attack coupled with an obvious Alefantis SLAPP lawsuit would greatly hinder InfoWars move into the DC office.
              </p>
              <p>
               From a business standpoint, Jones did the absolute right thing. Cut liability of child traffiker Alefantis and press forward with DC office.

             Here's the thing; AJ runs a business. He is liable for what he says. Slander cases in the US proceed pretty quickly because of case backlogs. They can be determined in a few of hearings. If they show a video of AJ making allegations, AJ will have to provide proof of allegations. If he doesn't have it they will rule in plaintiff's favor. He stood to lose a lot of money. So he is focusing on other areas while others can take up the fight against CPP. Pizzagate is a mass effort. So AJ is out when it comes to CPP, no big deal. Others are moving forward with investigation.

              No, James Alefantis has to prove Alex Jones made the allegations maliciously (knowing that they were false or with reckless disregard for the truth). Yes Alex could lose the lawsuit given the legal climate but technically, no, the burden does not fall on the defendant to prove the allegations were true. The burden is always on the plaintiff to prove every element of his claim. However nearly everything Alex Jones said about James Alefantis was true, up until the retraction, the first false statement Alex Jones has probably ever made in his life on his show.

               Yesterday he talked about it extensively. I feel like you could tell he was being dishonest about his retraction. He has a certain ego with his viewers, and he comes off as insecure when he knows he's being a letdown. I've seen it before, happens sometimes when you run a three hour daily broadcast, especially when the corporate world is cutting your ability to externally advertise and generate new funds.

                yeah I agree with you, he is being forced to say it and it makes him nervous. Part of why it is so disappointing is that he has to keep repeating it. Much of what he is talking about is stuff he's reported on before, and up until now, he was kind of ignoring pizzagate, now he is suddenly trying to go after pedophiles while simultaneously pretending there is no link here to James Alefantis. That's going to prove to be a lot more difficult than he thinks. I hope James gets arrested soon because watching Alex is becoming difficult for me and I loved the show prior to that.

               I agreed with everything you said until "first false statement."  AJ has dropped some wild theories.  Some of them were years ahead of the curve.  But other times he'll say you can search for something and it's not there.  Whenever I listen to him I find myself frantically searching what he says on the Internet.  It often checks out.  But sometimes he's out there on his own.  I think he's got so many facts, tips and articles rattling around in his head he conflates things.

              He single handily tried to destroy the credibility of the march that weekend.  He's no better than those baby lovers.  I don't believe for 1sec he was going to get sued, he bowed to almighty dollar.

               Well, he wouldn't have a show and then what? The monetary system and secular rule of law is the system we as a species have CHOSEN to live by. We may have made up the game but its a pretty fun game even if you have to play by the rules. If you have a better system, I am all ears.

                That's not true he wouldn't have a show.  Do some research about the vietnam era cointelpro.  They were CIA that infiltrated and led groups that were anti war to control the direction of the group and destroy it from within.  That's exactly why I think he has such a big show, he has unseen hands supporting him along the way.
