<p>Abuse in the Church of England is so widespread all parishes should print the safeguarding hotline number on service sheets, an independent report has concluded.</p>
<p>The idea of every parish having to publish the phone number to report paedophile priests is one of a string of recommendations from a review of the church’s safeguarding practices, as details of its repeated failures to protect people from child abuse emerge.</p>
<p>The largest ever survey of victims of abuse by vicars and bishops paints a damning picture of how the national church had dealt with the problem: only 11 of 60 respondents said they had received a meaningful response within a year after they disclosed their ordeals to a church figure.</p>
<p>Twenty said they had never had such a response, and more than half of those surveyed said the timeliness and quality of responses were “unsatisfactory”.</p>
<p>Among the other suggestions was for the church to adopt a public target for zero abuse, similar to building sites reporting how many days had passed since an accident.</p>
<p>The stories emerging from the survey reveal how dysfunctional the church has been in addressing the concerns of victims of abuse who have come forward in recent years.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>One vicar, who was themselves abused by a more senior cleric, was attacked by their bishop for daring to come forward. The unnamed bishop, who took no action against the abusing priest, told the victim: “The scent of failure will follow you throughout your ministry.”</strong></p>
<p><strong>Another survivor of abuse was told to attend prayer ministry sessions to “be healed of my problem with men” when they divulged a male vicar had attacked them.</strong></p>
<p><strong>When another person came forward to tell their local church authorities who had abused them, they were reminded the alleged perpetrator was a very high-profile figure and implied his role meant he was above suspicion.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>The Social Care Institute for Excellence</em>, the independent charity that carried out the review and survey on behalf of the Church of England, has recommended, partly as a result of these findings, the church no longer allow its 42 local dioceses to carry out safeguarding, and instead centralise the services to a more experienced and senior national team.</p>
<p><strong>But the church has rejected this recommendation, insisting that local bishops must remain in charge of the process.</strong></p>
<p>This decision comes just weeks after the longest-serving bishop in the Church of England, the bishop of Chester, Peter Forster, stepped back from all safeguarding responsibilities because it emerged in court he had been told about a paedophile priest in his diocese 10 years ago but did nothing.</p>
