<p>I can\'t recommend strongly enough to read this book and open your eyes. She names names in this book. 
- Cheney enjoys hunting humans (remember when he shot his friend during the duck hunting trip? Maybe this guy was mistaken for prey or got in the way?

- Pierre Elliott Trudeau sexually abused her
- Romney is briefly mentioned, but as far as I\'ve read, there\'s no details except that he hobnobs with these creatures
- Merle Haggard</p>
<p>I downloaded this book to my Nook for free from Barnes &amp; Noble. I can\'t stress enough what an important read this is for anyone wanting to know exactly what\'s going on and how best to navigate this vast rabbit burrow.</p>',

            Her documentation plus her visibility presents a threat that kangaroo courts may evolve into monkey trial.  The bigger the legal threat levied against her, the more likely it is to explode, a fact that has become recently more salient.

            You could direct us to a chapter of interest so we could "help" you...but you know you don't really have the book at all because you are here to distract and slide content with worthless, unsourced post from an author that has already been written off as crazy and could easily be dismissed as part of the
            <em>
             fake news
            </em>
            conspiracy.
           </p>
           <p>
            Meanwhile, folks like David Seaman's work could not be so easily discredited.

            I happened upon a copy of this when I was in my early twenties (early 2000's). I remember it being really dry reading in some places but I pushed through it and it changed my mind about a lot of things. Especially the people who were, and still are, RULING this country.

            Yes - I was thinking the same thing. Anyone who suggests C. O'Brien or her book has "questionable relevancy" to PG is ignorant of the history and context for what this is all about. But I have found that in more than one mod here...

              They depend on naive, nice people to constantly give them the benefit of the doubt. You don't just accidentally reply to 100% of comments by known shills while leaving supportive messsages and ignore everything else.

            Pro tip: when considering buying a book first google the book title and add "filetype:PDF" (no gaps) to the title. I've just downloaded that book for free on my Kindle Reader on my iPhone.

            the thing that always gets me about O'brien..Everyone else is too scared to name names because they will be sued. She doesn't get sued..which tends to make me think none of the accused want to giver her the opportunity to make her case in a court of law.

            We need to exercise skepticism here.  If O'Brien is for real, why hasn't she been suicided?  She's been saying this stuff for years.  All this reeks of disinformation, which is the main weapon the enemy is using to disrupt our efforts.  They want to get us labeled as tinfoil hatters.  As far as I'm aware, O'Brien never supplies anything resembling evidence to back her claims (anyone who has a source indicating otherwise, please provide it).  It would be relatively easy for CIA black projects to fund fake victim-witnesses who accuse everyone of everything, and mix in a lot of sensational nonsense, and before long, nobody is paying attention anymore.  That's how disinformation works.

             Serious question: How old are you? The younger you are, the more apt to thinking PG is an "event" in-and-of-itself with no history or context.
            </p>
            <p>
             Anyone who has studied the subvert, covert knows that the more public someone speaks out, the less likely they are to be "suicided". Not always (plenty of examples of notable people being killed) but it is one way to help yourself.

             Also, there is some benefit in disinformation. This doesn't mean that she has no relevant or accurate information but it's definitely not the whole story and may involve some disinformation. As with Ted Gunderson, doesn't make her irrelevant.

               No, it's part of the "story" and there is very likely relevant info - not all of it is disnfo. You have to know enough about the larger context to be able to determine what is/isn't accurate. That takes time, more information and critical thought. Nothing should get dismissed outright - that, alone, is suspicious.
              </p>
              <p>
               ETA: Also, you labeled this "irrelevant" - yet are saying it is disinformation.  Which is it?

             If I had to wager a guess as to why she's still around it's because only a small fringe group of people believe her. Basically most people look at her claims the way most look at pizzagate. "Oh there's no way that can happen".. "There would be too many people involved for that to stay a secret".. "I can't imagine doing those things therefore I can't imagine that others do them.".. etc.
While I don't disagree that disinformation is easily thrown into the mix, does that mean we never believe anything? How can we believe half the shit we read on here then? Some sketchy Instagram posts from edgelords that nothing can be done about legally will keep people going in circles for years while this continues right under our noses and in our own communities. Yeah I know it goes beyond that and blah blah.. just saying. People are spending an awful lot of time searching people's social media for crumbs. How do we know this isn't disinformation. And even if it is, does that negate everything else we DO know?

             Background knowledge on various subjects is essential if we're going to make sense of what we're looking at. I have been reading:
Programmed to Kill,  Operation Mind Control, The Tranceformation of America, The Secret Team, Thanks for the Memories and the Egyptian-Masonic-Satanic Connection. All can be snagged on the net. It's also advisable to educate yourself on Freemasonry, Alistair Crowley, occult symbolism, Illuminati and royal bloodlines, the various pedo coverups in the UK establishment and the powerful non-profits that run the world behind the scenes.

             Reading the book and try to understand the minds of these monsters, can maybe help the investigation. It can help to know what to look for, why they talk about this and that etc etc.

            This is fantastic. However, please tell us the significance of these different things. I am genuinely curious, and I don't have time to read the book right now (I'm reading Partners in Crime about the Clinton Foundation).

             Cathy O'Brien was abused by her father and his friends in high political places from when she was just a very little girl. She underwent MK Ultra programming and was made into a so called 'presidential model' sex slave.
            </p>
            <p>
             What does this have to do with Pizzagate? Well it's absolutely plausible that what happened to her is also happening to many of the kids involved in Pizzagate. I have read the book about a year ago and I immediately could see the connection to Pizzagate.
            </p>
            <p>
             Well worth the read if you want to comprehend the bigger picture of this whole mess. Pizzagate is much much bigger than Comet Pingpong.

              I'm blown away that this even needs to be said.  I honestly had no clue how many people frequent this sub, think pizzagate is actually about a pizza restaurant.  The amount of people questioning how Clinton foundation information, is relevant to pizzagate, Is frightening.

            We can go against the programming and dose ourselves with 'reality' in small units.  A video here, a book there.  Absorb, absorb, absorb.

            These are excellent links, and I'm going to brush up on my research this weekend.  I would also like to add that in order to get the whole picture, one should dive into a few occult books to understand WHY they do the things they do.  Survivor accounts are always a good reference point...seeing how broken someone is from the abuse always solidifies it.
           </p>
           <p>
            I lost most of my friends and family over the years voicing my concerns over the elite and the control games they play.  Everyone called me crazy.  It's nice to see some familiarity among brothers and sisters here.

            That book starts to get at the reality of what we are facing (although the aliens stuff makes me a little hesitant). But, let me help you out here. I've been doing this a long time.

            Here is the even bigger picture :)
           </p>
           <p>
            I have studied the elite for 20 years. Pizzagate isn't wholly new to me, but the scale took me aback. The elite sacrifice children for a reason. It is modern day worship of Saturn/Isis.
           </p>
           <p>
            Here is the whole story of Pizzagate for anyone interested. The truth is stranger than fiction.
           </p>
           <hr/>
           <p>
            The Scottish Masonic Order and their affiliates rule our planet. They are a direct continuation of the Brotherhood of Amon Ra that existed in Egypt 3500 years ago. Knights Templar, Medici's, Pheonicians were just a couple of the links in between. Our leaders are obsessed with Egyptian symbolism, specifically the story of Isis and Osiris. It's basically pretty cool math/geometry, but they have perverted it and made it into an esoteric movement. These people literally invented creationism and our religions (Islam, Non-Gnostic Christianity, Judaism). The Star of David is, at its heart, a mathematical symbol.
           </p>
           <p>
            Here you go (explore the Egyptian/mathematical symbolism through art and architecture of the past 2 thousand years):

             Downvote me if you think it is a coincidence the the latitude of the King's Chamber at the pyramids at Giza is the speed of light (in m/s), accurate to at least 6 digits. You would have to think Pizzagate is a coincidence too.

            The meter was defined in 1800, but it was merely rediscovered. It is a length ingrained into the architecture of our solar system, as any student of Masonry would learn. Here is the King's chamber when measured in meters:

            Maybe the meter isn't so arbitrary after all, if it is being used to encode the golden ratio in Egypt, thousands of years before the System International. By the way, the perimeter of the chamber's base is 10 pi meters. They squared the circle at the same time.

            Numerology and mythology seem pretty fucking retarded, and they are, but our leaders fucking love it. You have to understand it, in order to understand our current situation, and them. It goes back thousands of years. If there is anything that you guys should be learning through Pizzagate, it is that many of the men and the women with the tin foil hats on, were preaching reality in your face (to a limit- I think that limit is aliens, but I am open minded). I think that it can be easy to try to explain this Egyptian symbolism as artistic influence, but major historic figures have gone out of their fucking way to make a point of it (as you will see in the first video).
           </p>
           <p>
            Last thing, FUCK THE BROTHERHOOD OF AMON RA. They sacrifice children like sheep.
           </p>
           <p>
            Just remember that at heart, humans are good. These videos will make you question reality, but we have each others' backs.
           </p>
           <p>
            You guy's have found the tippy tip of the iceberg. Dive down and see the entirety of it in its horror.
           </p>
           <p>
            You have been hit HARD with the truth from pizzagate. Don't suddenly just stop. Go all the way. Watch the videos. I promise I am not fucking with you.

              Debunk
             </strong>
             : The Egyptians measured in
             <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cubit">
              cubits
             </a>
             which range from 523.5-529mm depending on the time period. That means there are about 1.91 cubits in a meter.
            </p>
            <p>
             1.91 x pi x 10 = 60.0. That means the chamber is exactly 10 x 20 cubits. It also so happens that the length of each pyramid size averages out to 230.4 meters wide by 146.5  meters tall or...
             <strong>
              440 x 280 cubits

              No I wouldn't. The Greatest Monument of all time was tallest in the world for millennia. There is not a pool of monuments that I am selecting from. This is a false analogy.
