           I just recently rewatched Who Took Johnny on Netflix, and happened upon the scene where they show footage from Americas Most Wanted of the crew leading Paul Bonacci around the house in Colorado that allegedly housed Johnny Gosch. I can't find that footage anywhere else. John Walsh is interviewed about the episode in the Netflix documentary as well as Bonacci.

            Did you get an answer for this? I was wondering the same thing. I remember seeing that AMW segment on TV as a kid. I was wanting to rewatch it after seeing the clip on Who took Johnny but i can't seem to find it anywhere and no one lists it on their website as a past episode. it's really freaking weird.

             Sorry for the late response! I have no had an answer. Unless it was only that incredibly short segment from Who Took Johnny, then it's been scrubbed from the internet. That would be telling in itself.
