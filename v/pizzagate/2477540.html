Obviously the University of Berkeley is famous for being the new home of the 100%-Jewish Frankfurt School after the Nazis threw them out.</p>
<p><a href="https://s18.postimg.org/ihp3cplbd/ghetto.png">Gourmet Ghetto</a></p>
<p>Waters\' former employees started the &quot;celebrity chef&quot; scene.

<p>The very first location, Peets Coffee, was founded by a Jewish immigrant who mentored the Jewish founders of Starbucks <a href="http://idsgn.org/images/starbucks-reveals-new-logo-drops-wordmark/logo-source.png">(whose original logo was an occult sexual reference</a>)

<p>This is the same M.O. previously demonstrated to have occurred in Seattle, i.e. Jewish immigrants follow miners/pioneers to newly-founded West Coast population centers to be outfitters/wholesalers/vice monopolies etc.  Sometimes you\'ll see Armenians because they historically had a similar social function in Muslim lands as Jews did in Christian lands (moneylending/middlemen) and probably got involved in the same kabbalah circles.

            the body of the post need to be edited, I will delete this post.

            The headline is not accurate. It suggests the 'pedo swirl' is outside the restaurant, but it isn't, it's on a truck that maybe has delivered food or groceries to the restaurant. Please change the title accordingly.
           </p>
           <p>
            Please also add an intro to your post and explain why you would like to look into Alice Waters and the 'Edible Schoolyard' project. Please note that posts must be comprehensible for newbies who haven't read anything about Pizzagate yet.
           </p>
           <p>
            Also, some of your statements need explanation:

           <ul>
            <li>
             'Edible Schoolyard is located behind her restaurant' - whose restaurant are you referring to?

            <li>
             'presumably because they were all Jews' - to whom is 'they' referring? All shop owners / restaurant owners in the 'Gourmet Ghetto'? If so, please provide evidence that they were / are all Jewish
            </li>
            <li>
             'whose original logo was an occult sexual reference' - please explain the occult meaning
            </li>
            <li>
             'Masons are a known Jewish front' - please provide evidence
            </li>
            <li>
             'Sometimes you'll see Armenians because they historically had a similar social function in Muslim lands as Jews did' please provide a source

            <li>

             Rule 2: Empiricism: EACH factual claim that is not common knowledge must be sourced with a link. If you ask a question: Explain what led to your question and provide sources. If you present opinion/argument, connect your dots and provide sources for them. Avoid baseless speculation. ALL posts must include at least one link.

             Rule 3: Clarity: All titles must adequately describe post content
