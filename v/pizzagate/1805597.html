Williams calling out FBI Director James Comey, saying he\'s a child molester and is obsessed Howdy Doody, as well as his affiliation in trafficking rings with Prince Andrew, Epstein and Bill Clinton. </p>
<p>Here\'s the video: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JWdTXTyyD04">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JWdTXTyyD04</a></p>
<p>Now, I\'ve been a pretty longtime subscriber of the Doctor of Common Sense, and while he may be comedic at times, he is always seeking the truth and trying to call things how he sees it. I do believe his story. So we wanted to see what Howdy Doody was all about because we\'re god damned millennials, so we went to Youtube. But what my friends and I discovered after watching a few Howdy Doody videos was pretty fuckin creepy to say the least. </p>
<p>Look at this video of the show from 1950s: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mw8jL7j9_WA">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mw8jL7j9_WA</a></p>
<p>Look closely and you can see subliminal messaging multiple times. Here\'s a video I found which shows how the &quot;Doodyville&quot; sign in the intro represents the Moloch. </p>
<p>But here\'s the creepy part: look at the video right around the 33 second mark. Did you catch that? </p>
<p>Here\'s a screenshot: <a href="http://imgur.com/a/Vc1SM">http://imgur.com/a/Vc1SM</a></p>
<p>CREEPY HUH? It flashes for about a millisecond. And this is what they\'re showing children? </p>
<p>Also there\'s another one at 24 seconds: <a href="http://imgur.com/a/ts6f0">http://imgur.com/a/ts6f0</a></p>
<p>Weird, a creepy Wayne Gacy- esque clown holding a sign that seems to be a PO Box number, but weird, because when I watch other episodes from the same year, they advertise their PO Box as this:</p>
<p><a href="http://imgur.com/a/pxBdA">http://imgur.com/a/pxBdA</a></p>
<p>Why would they flash that image so fast and why is the PO Box different?</p>
<p>Also here\'s some screenshots of some pretty pedolike clips from the show:</p>

<p><a href="http://imgur.com/a/E8hPa">http://imgur.com/a/E8hPa</a></p>
<p>Could this show be an early form of MK Ultra? Could this kind of stuff be a reason why James Comey has a sick obsession with Howdy Doody? Is my tinfoil hat on too tight?</p>',

            Well, I seem to just be the most recent of recent activity. It's showing me 82 comments now. I found it because I just dig and dig. That Howdy Doody reveal is quite something. In fact, I'm seeing that name from a whole different perspective. The show looks like a scandal waiting to be exposed. Good find.

            I watched a video of his some months ago where he was talking about Hillary "munching rugs" I think is how he put, and I was like, yes, but the way he's describing it is too far out there. But the more you dig into Pizza/PedoGate, let alone all the psyops and false flags, the more believable ETW is. Now it sounds perfectly plausible to me.

            I was raised in the blackest part of DC and he has that mix of "telling it" and grabbing your attention. Besides maybe releasing info to have it "trickle across" to other demographics, this guy might be tasked with building a following of POC.

            No one has debunked ET. I believe him also, after watching this video a few times and a bunch of his others. Just got a gut feeling that he's telling the truth. Doesn't mean he's going to be right everytime, but I definitely believe this one. Comey is clear part of the cabal.

            Dr. Piecheinick is a legend. To have him play the Howdy Doody character next to him speaking is priceless. He would not do that unless it was a message to James Comey. Notice how he did not speak of it but called Comey an actor in a play.

            E.T. Williams is also a legend. He works for some type of military intelligence. He has revealed very tightly held secrets about Obama for the past few years. He has been visited by secret service which he taped. He still states these things and so far everything he has said in the end has been true. I thought the Howdy Doody thing was so far out there but it has been confirmed then to have Dr. Peichenick post this is wild.
           </p>
           <p>
            It has been reported this is what Pres. Trump meant when he tweeted "there better not be any tapes" to Comey. It was a hint about videotapes.

            I saw at least one swirl symbols, possibly 2. 
 If you watch starting at around 15 seconds, you see the clock face fade into a swirl. 
 And then right after that the sign seems to fade into a swirl too, at around 22-23 seconds.
           </p>
           <p>
            Wow, they have been using swirls for symbols for a long time.  What will they do now that we know.  No wonder the MeanStreamMedia is keeping the symbols under wrap.

             And a triangle within a triangle that comes out of the globe in the opening sequence, together with the highlighted "yvil" (evil?) in 'doodeyville'. I've been through it a few times and none of those kids look happy to be there.  Stinks of MK ultra.  How long have they been pushing this crap in our faces?

            This video is witness testimony, it basically comes down to believability. It is a matter of either you take ET Williams word for it or not. Is he the type of person to risk his reputation and following for lie about comey? What I see are the shills are working in tandem to create doubt. It's an old sales technique. Notice they do not post reasoning, or actual facts to create doubt. They are simply asking you questions repeatedly.

            : I am curious why do you keep questioning repeatedly? You can judge for yourself if it is believable or not. Are you trying to plant seeds of doubt in someone else? If you think the source is not credible and want to convince someone of the error of their ways then state your reasoning and why. What specifically concerns you about ET Williams?

            The Doctor of Common Sense is funny as hell, I've had many a laugh watching that channel. When I saw that bit about Howdy Doody and Prince Charles I had to literally hit myself to stop laughing. And I'm not even fucking joking right now. I almost passed out, it was touch and go for a bit.
           </p>
           <p>
            But I'm pretty sure the James Comey likes to have sex with Prince Charles because he looks like Howdy Doody is a comedy skit. I hate to be condescending but I gotta call em like I see em.

             you have a strange sense of humor but ok to each his own. Are you seriously saying you would dismiss a witness account that is on the record simply because it made you laugh? That is hard to believe, either you lack judgement or intelligence, either way your sense of humor is not a reason to dismiss anything. It reminds me of the psy op tactic to discredit witness accounts as conspiracy theories without actually addressing the issue.  Nothing about our topic is laughable and nothing is unbelievable. Facts debunk, your sense of humor carries no weight and is worthless.

              Witness? The Doctor of Common Sense didn't witness James Comey have sex with Prince Charles because he looks like Howdy Doody. The good Doctor heard a rumor. That's a lot different.

               ET Williams said he watched the video himself. He did NOT watch the kiddie porn video. According to ET Williams these videos came from Anthony wiener computer. He did watch two consensual adults, he said one was comey. That's a big deal to go on record to say that about the current  head of the FBI. 
Keep in mind this would not be the first FBI director that is a sexual deviant being blackmailed: j Edgar Hoover was allegedly a cross dresser and a closeted homosexual that lived with his mother. 
I cut and paste directly from Wikipedia and the link is below. 
Hoover engaging in cross-dressing in the 1950s, at homosexual parties.[79][80][81] Summers also said the Mafia had blackmail material on Hoover, which made Hoover reluctant to pursue organized crime aggressively.

                 Towards the end of the video starting at the 41 second mark he says:
 " I did view the video of James comey mounting prince Charles...he was holding his ears from the back like this from the back...when he was doing it and he was squealing like a hog."
                </p>
                <p>
                 Earlier in the video He also states that he shared the video with other trusted sources just in case.
                </p>
                <p>
                 He did NOT view the child porn video since that is illegial to view and share. He states that repeatedly to cover himself.
                </p>
                <p>
                 Link below I am not sure if it will start on 41 second towards the end. Hopefully this works.

                  That's the thing. If you suspected the head of the FBI was a pedophile and could connect him to making child pornography would you release that evidence to a wider audience? If I had evidence children were being sexually abused I'd go out of my way to let as many people know as possible. You would too. You'd do everything in your power to stop the abuse. You wouldn't sit on the information and mail it in making youtube videos.

                   You are spreading disinformation. A few minutes ago you stated that ET Williams NEVER watched the video and you even went so far to take a statement out of context and link it to support your false statement.  Now you switch into making this about what I or you would do ? There is no you or I we clearly don't play on the same team. I don't spread disinformation and if I did I would first acknowledge the mistake you are hell bent creating doubt and spreading false information. If you are here for children then You need to verify your facts before you state them in unequivocally terms. It's dangerous when you spread disinformation. You seem to have an agenda to create confusion, doubt, and false leads. Another word for that is liar.

                    I hadn't watched the last part of the video. You or someone else gave me the exact minute mark of where he said he saw the video. I'm sorry, I didn't mean to spread disinfo. The very first reference to the video Williams implies he heard about what was in it. I thought he mean the James Comey mounting Prince Charles. It's sort of ambiguous.

                    and I had it out over Trey Gowdy's two missing investigators. He thought I was spreading disinformation too. Well guess what happened? Someone finally looked up the about page of the third reference to that story and it openly says their news stories are mostly satire and "baloney".

                     I see right through your divide and conquer techniques. I do not know anyone here. You on the other hand consistently spread lies. you actually made me doubt myself with your pompous declaration about that video. When you claim to state the truth it better be the truth, otherwise you are a liar. I had to rewatch that video from top to bottom and then transcribe and link it to you. You know why? Because I care about the truth because you spread disinformation and witness testimony is important to this cause. Because this is about victims that have no voice and you are silencing victims with your lies. You are a dangerous manipulator otherwise known as a shill.

But if you study it carefully as I have done numerous times you can iron out any nuances and any surface (minor) apparent contradictions and/or conflicting statements to your (one's) satisfaction. It's likely (more than likely) he threw this thing together in the heat of the moment soon after he viewed it.

                    Are you an American or from Holland? If you're not American you might be getting fooled by what you're calling "nuances".

                     Look, he's excited, and angry, so there's some conflation going on (forget 'nuance') in that he mixes the Prince Andrew and Comey part (what he himself saw) with the child molestation part (which he did NOT see) ... in some of the parts of the video. But he clears up any confusion w/ his statement at the end.

                     That's all I'm saying. Believe what you want. I know the guy, it would be very difficult for him to lie about something like this.

                      I'm still not convinced. You've got to remember someone with a Youtube channel is getting paid for views. There's a monetary incentive to embellish the truth at times.

                     <p>
                      Many sites out there do the same thing:

                      I'm just skeptical of everything now. I trust no one.
