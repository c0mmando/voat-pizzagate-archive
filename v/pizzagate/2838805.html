<p>KAMPALA, Uganda – One baby was healthy and the other cold and lifeless, a young Ugandan couple felt one of their twin babies had been swapped at Uganda\'s main public hospital. They rejected the dead one. DNA tests later proved it wasnt their baby. Officials say parents in Uganda risk losing their children in scams orchestrated by doctors and nurses who are apparently selling the babies. But this year alone, at least three cases of baby theft have been reported at Mulago Hospital in Uganda\'s capital,  A  report released last year said there were 261 cases of child theft over a 12-month period, but that includes teenagers.</p>
<p>break down the numbers.
a doctor named Asinja Kapuru confessed to swapping a healthy baby for a dead one after being confronted with the results of a DNA test. Police arrested and questioned the doctor Tuesday before releasing him because his case is still under investigation, according to Onyango. He said Kapuru is likely to be charged with child theft.</p>

<p>Ugandan families have been bribed, tricked or coerced into giving up their children to US citizens and other foreigners for adoption, a Thomson Reuters Foundation investigation has found.
Leaked documents, court data and a series of  interviews with officials, whistleblowers, victims and prospective adoptive parents has revealed:
– a culture of corruption in which children’s birth histories are at times manipulated to make them appear as orphans when they are not
– a lucrative industry in which lawyers acting on behalf of foreign applicants receive large payments
– a mushrooming network of unregistered childcare institutions through which children are primed for adoption
– an absence of reliable court data to counteract allegations of negligence or fraud by probation officers involved in the adoption process Across Uganda church-backed orphanages and private child care institutions are springing up.</p>
<p>Inter-country adoptions constitute a booming industry in which child traffickers are profiteering,” she said.
According to Ugandan law, foreigners can acquire a legal guardianship days after arriving and complete the process back home. Data from the US State Department shows that 201 children were adopted from Uganda by US citizens.
Uganda’s parliament is expected to pass tighter legislation, but corruption and bureaucracy have stalled the process. &quot;But now, with levels of child trafficking at such a high level, it should be a priority.” Ugandan children regularly pass through Kampala’s Entebbe international airport.
On a given day they can be seen hand-in-hand with white adoptive parents at the departure gate.
Many of these adoptions will lead to successful unions between the child and his or her adoptive parents.
But others will never make it this far.</p>
<p>In Uganda, a lack of available documents makes it impossible to determine how many adoptions involve fraud, but four government officials believe the problem was widespread.“Some lawyers lie about the birth history of the child,” said Stella Ogwang, an official in the Ministry of Gender, Labour and Social Development, which oversees child welfare. Another senior government official, described Uganda’s adoption system as “a racket”.</p>
<p>A report, funded by UNICEF , also found that biological parents and relatives gave up their children in the belief they would receive money from adoptive parents and children’s homes.</p>
<p>Securing access to court files takes several months and certain files ware withheld by the judiciary.
Inter-country adoption is widely believed to be a lucrative business. Officials estimate a Ugandan lawyer can earn $30,000 during the adoption process.</p>
