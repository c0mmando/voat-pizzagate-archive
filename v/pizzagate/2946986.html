<p>In a pre-sentence report, presented to court, Wysom told a probation officer that he developed an addiction to adult pornography about a decade ago, but slowly became desensitized to it and “needed something more.” He turned to child pornography, Wysom said, which became a way to deal with his clinical depression and other medical issues.</p>

            Hmm, I definitely believe his claim that his addiction spiraled him into that mess. I do feel bad for him, I'm just glad he didn't hurt any children in reality--or at least, as far as we know. People don't understand that pornography is designed to drag people down into stuff like this, and worse. It's not right to call people like this, "devils." Remember? The devils are the ones who conduct Satanic Ritual Abuse and torture children, not simple child porn addicts.
           </p>
           <p>
            Also, I didn't think I'd need to say this, liking the new My Little Pony is fine---it has good morals and portrays a world where evil is rare and naivete is common. So it's a nice escape from reality and perhaps motivating, I believe I have found it motivating. Except when they started introducing LGBT into the show. Then it became uninteresting.
           </p>
           <p>
            Also, some fans of the show are pedophiles, and many have leftist brainwashing. I've seen direct evidence of the pedophilia in the fan community.

            Want to cry for these little children.  This person, and all he shared it with needs to be executed not put in prison to be treated with kid gloves.  I heard that here in the UK they get special treatment, by being separated from the general convicts, because they will be in danger in the general cons in prison.  Where is the justice in that? I am also sick of the excuses: Wysom said, "which became
            <strong>
             a way to deal with his clinical depression and other medical issues"
            </strong>
            - sick sick sick, they know they will get off lighter for 'mental illness' -  'Mental Illness' is almost hallowed as much as 'Hate Speech' or 'Racism' or 'LGBTQ...phobia'  etc.,  these days'. -  This basically means you can get off with light consequences in law, if you blame something other than yourself!

            I have not even looked, but I just bet these stupid pieces of plastic were sold on Christmas past, made in China. Videos made in, by who? Funny thing aboot Canada is that they can travel, and live here freely, but us Americans cannot do the same there. In other countries around the World the USA passport is disrespected under and beyond the CAN. Unfair practice! They buy our most expensive properties using the Chinese/Can inflation model. Sorry to rant, but I have been right since before I was on the Eeinternet. Puke.

            What the fuck does any of that have to do with Christmas? This is Cabal version of XMAS. Trash, pure trash. Blizzard is trash.
           </p>
           <p>
            AND KEEP IN MIND THAT THE MOBA GENRE IS GEARED TOWARD AN OLDER CROWD. HotS is chock full of cabal crap, demons abound.... gross.

               They don't necessarily follow Satanism (yet), but yeah, pedophiles are dangerous---it's possible this guy doesn't want to have sex with children, although after being brainwashed by 60,000 child porn images it's hard to imagine that anyone could have normal sexuality.

                 Well, I hesitate to call pedophiles "evil," so I opted for "dangerous." Especially if they haven't hurt any children. I don't like to presume someone is evil simply because they looked at a lot of bad pictures. There was nothing stupid about my comment, feel free to pick it apart and tell me what I did wrong.

                  So I guess it must take a person to look at 70000 pictures to become a pedophile? So the first 10 pictures of children getting raped isn’t enough?

                   I'm not a pedophile. You need to define your terms. What is a pedophile to you? Where do you draw the line between pedophile and normal person?

            This excuse of "regular porn doesn't do it for me so I need the kiddie stuff" is utter bullshit.  It also sets a narrative that it isn't child predators' faults which is also shit.

             Pedos use any excuse they can pluck from the popular zeitgeist of the day. The excuses come and go, but the pedophilic behavior remains. Almost like there's no connection at all. They do it because they want to. It's all just a degree of opportunity and escalation. The end point is always the same.

              Well technically, I think I've heard castration as another cure, but in terms of appropriate punishment, you may be right. Sometimes I think death penalty might even be too good for them

            maybe i've read too many stories of government agencies weaponizing CP. I just do not believe any report when people are suddenly found with a ton of CP.  If you are trying to kill someone, but first permanently tarnish their reputation, this is the perfect way.

            Its not surprising that those who wish to make cinema for children often end up getting in degenerative activities and behaviors involving pedophile and child pornography. Its all part of the mechanics of the whole process.

              Why would someone save ten-thousands of non-pornographic images of children?
             </p>
             <p>
              Like let's say 99% are non-porn and he uses them as reference for drawing since he's an animator...
             </p>
             <p>
              A year has 356 days. 60.000 / 365 = 164
             </p>
             <p>
              If he drew one of them each day it would last over 160 years.
             </p>
             <p>
              Okay I'm not taking duplicates because of backups into account but either way it seems kinda excessive...

                         I had the unfortunate experience to be staying at a hotel where one of these events was being held.  There's nothing normal about these people.  Most of them are marginal loser table types.  Sterliize them and move them to their own island along with the other fringe weirdos not-quite-deserving of GTMO or other penal institution.

                          Yes isolate them so no harm can be done, if they are found to cross the line with children.  I saw a video on the internet of the people who dress like animals, there were 1,000s at the time I thought it was funny.  Didn't enter my head at the time about the perverts interested in children inside the costume. :'(

             If it's a Canuck Court they barely punish molestation/child porn.  A man in Sudbury (Ontario Canada) recently got 11 months after pleading guilty to molesting his girlfriends daughter (aged 5-7) over a 2 year period.
