<p>The CIA was engaged in a war against communism (Gladio) whose units were trained by CIA &amp; British Intelligence. Thousands of priests and bishops were trained to fight the idealogy. They were also physical trained.  The CIA funded the Christian-Democratic Party in Italy to fight communism.  In 1950s and 1960s CIA provided economic support to activities promoted by the Vatican from orphanages to missions. Millions of dollars each year was given to bishops and monsigneurs.   One of them was Giovanni Battisti Montini, who later became Pope Paul VI.  
</p>
<p>Catholic Gladio meetings were held in Freemason lodges.  Thus Propaganda Due (P2) was created. Most of its members were mafia bosses and military.  P2 enjoyed full approval of the CIA.  The church had always condemned freemasonry, but it was now supporting it in the fight against communism.  The Mafia was also involved.  Over the next decade an almost endless list of bishops, cardinals and Vatican officials became members of P2. This was done with the tacit approval of the Pope.  Pope Paul VI received millions of dollars from the CIA and his ascendancy to Pope was aided by CIA.</p>
<p>Gelli, head of P2, was able to set up ratlines for the nazis escaping to South America.  He was involved in the death of Calvi (God\'s banker), who was found hanging from some bridge scaffolding. At first it was thought to be suicide, but later found to be murder.   Gelli was receiving $10million a month from the CIA.  P2 included members of the Gambino crime family, Richard Nixon and other politicians.  Gelli conducted surveillance with the view of blackmailing.  The victims of blackmail were required to join P2. It was Gelli who took the photo of a naked John Paul II near a pool.</p>
<p>Michele Sindona worked for the Vatican Bank.  He was the bridge between CIA, Vatican and the mafia.  He used CIA funds and mob money to buy BPF (Banca Privata Finanziaria), transferring drug money from the Vatican Bank to be used for Gladio operations.   The Vatican was mainly a mechanism for money laundering of drug trafficking funds, and looked the other way for a large commission.  Sindona\'s banking enterprise turned into a $22 billion empire.   CIA have always been in the banking business in order to create losses in failed ventures for money laundering so as to effect regime change.</p>
<p>BPF Bank staff were caught moving money from their accounts to the Vatican Bank to Sindona\'s personal accounts.  Sindona became the most powerful financial figure in Italy. By 1967 the IRS became suspicious in his involvement in money laundering. In 1969 the Vatican found itself in trouble when the government changed its tax-free status.  The Vatican is involved in geopolitical affairs because of its vast financial interests in Middle Eastern oil. </p>

            . The book is a history of Le Cercle and The 6I, two very powerful supranational right wing organisations who exerted a lot of power behind the scenes during the Cold War, including almost completely subverting the UK political system during the 1970s. Lots and lots of pedo connections: Baron de Bonvoisin, who plays a prominent role in the X dossier outlined in ISGP's investigation

            It's a long and difficult read but very comprehensive. If you learn one thing from it, please let it be this: there are multiple competing globalist organisations. Some of them have access to intelligence agencies, some of them
            <em>
             are
            </em>
            intelligence agencies. Some of them work together, some tolerate each other, others hate each other. Any claims that P2 or the Jews or the Jesuits or the CIA or the Masons are all-powerful is simplistic to say the least.

              Yes - I believe at least some of the newer technology-focused groups want mankind to better themselves: longer lifespans, better lives through technology, space exploration and so on. That of course is diametrically opposed to the Old World Order groups who want control, fear and subjugation. However their goals might overlap in some critical areas. An organisation with tech CEOs as members might want open borders in Europe to increase their user base long term. The globalists who want an excuse to unveil the EU army also want open borders so they can destabilize the continent. So to the extent that these goals align, they will co-operate whereever possible.

            Eustace Mullins wrote a book about who are behind all this branches from the beginning (Jesuites, Masons, Royalties, occult groups, Fed etc) 
I also recommend "The Secret Teachings of All Ages" by Manly Palmer Hall.

I urge you to read this book to understand the whole puzzle.

             The 13 Black Nobility houses are mainly based in Spain and Italy. I can name them all if requested.
            </p>
            <p>
             Yes, the Rothschilds take orders from the Black Nobility. The Jesuits are at the very least the same level as the Rothschilds.

             Canaanites worshiped a deity called Ba'al.

            <p>
             Possibly also tied to "Children of the Golden Bull" (Moloch).

             So yeah, satanic practices are at least as old as the Old Testament era of history. Our problem is due to satanists.

            Thank you for this. I was considering making a thread about the P2 Free Mason Lodge regarding a tip I received. I was having trouble figuring out how to connect them to pizzagate though.
           </p>
           <p>
            The tip in question: "All roads lead to Rome". This means that much of the rot in the world can trace itself to Rome, whether through the Vatican, P2 Free Mason Lodge, the Jesuits, or the Black Nobility.
           </p>
           <p>
            Be warned. P2 Free Mason Lodge are VERY bad people.

             Indeed they are VERY dangerous people.
P2 Has much to keep quiet about the triple murder of Alcasser girls in Spain, and MANY deaths like Alcasser crime. Especially on the coast of Valencia. 
In Spain the Banesto bank case is directly related to what happened earlier in Italy with the bank Ambrossiano and the '' suicide '' of Calvi.

             it's not the Jews, it's the reptilian/vatican/jesuit/archon/neo-roman council of 33 super spooky illuminati. Thanks for the insight bro. At last I truly see.
