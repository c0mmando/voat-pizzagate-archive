<p>I also found a connection between Corey Haim and Charlie Sheen while looking into the above.</p>
<p>An article (<a href="http://www.celebdirtylaundry.com/2013/corey-feldman-coreyography-pedophiles-child-abuse-tell-all-names-1022/">http://www.celebdirtylaundry.com/2013/corey-feldman-coreyography-pedophiles-child-abuse-tell-all-names-1022/)</a>) about Corey Feldman’s tell-all book, &quot;Coreyography: A Memoir&quot;, says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>While making the coming-of-age film Lucas, Corey Haim was convinced by an adult male predator who worked on the movie, “that it was perfectly normal for older men and younger boys in the business to have sexual relations, that it was what all the guys do.” Haim then allowed the adult to sodomize him. Haim was 15 years old.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Corey Haim was born in 1971. He would be 15 in 1986. Charlie Sheen was also in the film Lucas in 1986 according to IMDB. <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000221/?ref_=ttfc_fc_cl_i3">http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000221/?ref_=ttfc_fc_cl_i3</a>. could be coincidence, or could be another lead on the Hollywood side.</p>
<p>Sheen and Clooney were both in Grizzly (<a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0093119/fullcredits?ref_=tt_ov_st_sm">http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0093119/fullcredits?ref_=tt_ov_st_sm)</a>) so they must know each other. These guys all go to parties together probably the parties that Elijah Wood\'s mom didn\'t want him attending</p>
<p>I\'m not making any specific allegations about people at this time, but Sheen and Clooney might be worth looking into. Maybe there are more connections. But there is a well-established connection between Clinton and Clooney, and Clooney and the CF, so I think that should be the priority.</p>
<p>I searched the Pizzagate sub for Clooney and didn\'t find anything. surprised no one has mentioned this before?.</p>',

            I know I'm late to the discussion; however I didn't want to create another thread when one was created for the topic I wanted to comment on. Which was how "The Corey's" were known victims of hollywood pedophilia. To add to this thread, I recently read an article from 2011 on how the then newly deceased Haim was snubbed out of a "Pedo-wood" tribute video for those fallen that year at the Oscar's. Feldman, 'somewhat' bashed Charlie; however if you weren't familiar with the situation, it would've went over your head and made Feldman look like he was just complaining about Sheen's success. But I think this was Feldman admitting it was Sheen who molested Haim while filming Lucas.
           </p>
           <p>
            <em>
             "Well I have to be completely honest and say, I'm not a huge fan of Charlie Sheen. I don't make it my goal to ever talk badly in the press, we're all in it together, that's the way I look at it, but Charlie in particular, especially the way that he's affected other people that I know — point blank, Charlie and Corey started their careers pretty much together, and Corey fought for his entire life to recover from those early experiences and to get his life together."
            </em>
           </p>
           <p>
            Another thing I found weird about the article provided for confirmation, is if you hover your mouse on every spaced paragraph an icon appears on the top right corner for "expressions", every single paragraph has one, except the one with the provided quote from Feldman. Thought that was odd. Just an observation.

            Is this how clooney got his classic look down and then back up that drives women crazy? Check out the kid, then imply he wants both with his eyes? Probably not, but it might work because of celebrity status.

            MAY I ASK- Does anyone read ALL the threads to maintain overall picture to this project?  Clooney was brought up months ago. FBI said research who she associates with - that would be Clooney. Also his wife was Julian's attorney - till she quit. Odd?  But that was mentioned months ago on this site. Also Streisand,Cher?  Clooney put in large pizza oven in remodel.
           </p>
           <p>
            There are numerous threads re mult areas that go over, discovertge same info.  It's confounding.
