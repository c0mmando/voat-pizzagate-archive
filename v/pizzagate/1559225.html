<p>Agent Name: ANDREW KESSEL</p>
<p>Agent Address: 610 PRESIDENT CLINTON AVENUE LITTLE ROCK, AR 72201</p>
<p>Directors / Officers:</p>
<p>ANDREW KESSEL, cfo</p>

<p>BRUCE LINDSEY, director</p>
<p>CHELSEA CLINTON, director</p>
<p>CHERYL MILLS, director</p>

<p>In July 2013, the board of the Bill, Hillary and Chelsea Clinton Foundation approved a salary of more than $395,000, plus bonus, for its new Yale-educated CEO, Eric Braverman, who had worked with Chelsea Clinton at the prestigious McKinsey &amp; Company consultancy. The former first daughter pulled strings so Braverman could help her impose McKinsey-like management rigor to a foundation that had grown into a $2 billion charitable powerhouse.</p>
<p>Just a year and a half after Braverman arrived, he abruptly resigned, and Politico reported that his exit stemmed partly from a power struggle inside the foundation between and among the coterie of Clinton loyalists who have surrounded the former president for decades and who helped start and run the foundation. Some, including the president’s old Arkansas lawyer Bruce Lindsey, who preceded Braverman as CEO, raised concerns directly to Bill Clinton about the reforms implemented by Braverman, and felt themselves marginalized by the growing influence of Chelsea Clinton and the new CEO she had helped recruit. What played out over the past two years at the foundation was the story of Chelsea Clinton’s rise. Now 35 and with the official title of vice chair at the foundation, her power now cannot be overstated: no major decisions occur without her input.&quot;</p>

<p>Clinton Library</p>
<p>The William J. Clinton Presidential Center and Park is the presidential library of Bill Clinton, the 42nd President of the United States (1993–2001). It is located in Little Rock, Arkansas and includes the Clinton Presidential Library, the offices of the Clinton Foundation, and the University of Arkansas Clinton School of Public Service.</p>
<p>The library has been criticized for not including much information about the pardons Clinton issued just before leaving office.</p>
<p>Clinton pardoned former financier Marc Rich, a fugitive who had been charged with multiple counts of racketeering, wire fraud, income tax evasion, and illegal oil trading.</p>
<p>Rich\'s wife, Denise Eisenberg Rich, was reported to have made three donations totaling nearly $1,000,000 to Clinton\'s presidential library fund, as well as multiple other contributions to the Democratic Party and Hillary Rodham Clinton\'s senate campaign. It was later found that she only made three payments totaling $450,000 to the fundraiser. </p>
<p>Clinton has also been criticized for the library\'s lack of coverage regarding various scandals during his presidency, including the Whitewater scandal.</p>

            In case you didn't get the memo The Clinton Foundation is really an organized crime syndicate. It's sort of like a White Anglo-Saxon Protestant version of an Sicilian Crime Family.

            The IHRC just an elaborate money laundering facility. That's how they keep up the front that they're a charity. If the Clinton Foundation were ever given a financial audit the truth would come out pretty quick.
