            I saw someone a few days ago writing that the "good" priests within the Catholic Church need to be standing up and demanding the pedos be held accountable.
           </p>
           <p>
            That would be a good start, but what else needs to happen is ALL Catholics need to STOP being silent and start demanding that their church and their leaders do something. The best way to force action is to close up the wallets! Stop giving money to an institution that allows this sickness to run rampant! Don't give them a dime until they actually do something to protect kids and prosecute the sick pedo priests! If you give them money, you are enabling the rape and abuse of kids to continue!

             This has been happening for a while, Shizy. A lot of serious Catholics (unaware of the extent of the pizzagate problem in the Church), have completely stopped contributing to Catholic Relief Services and other major charities due to other bullshit coming out of Rome and the USCCB like open borders and "eco justice" (global warming).

            The Vatican has denied any cover-up over the abuse of 200 deaf boys in the United States by Reverend Lawrence Murphy from 1950 to 1974. The New York Times reported the Vatican and Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger, now Pope Benedict, were warned about Murphy but he was not defrocked.

            Crimes occur under Pope Benedict's watch but he can't be held responsible because he's head of state with immunity. Then he "retires" but is sequestered in the Vatican where again he is protected by the Lateran Pact. Bishops aren't required by the Church to report child abuse in their parishes. Child abuse by Church clergy doesn't go up the ladder because according to the Church, clergy are not employees of the Vatican but of the local parish (who cover up the crimes). The Church is very insulated against prosecution. Trump needs to pull off the veil and designate the Church as a RICO racketeer influenced and corrupt organization)
The 1929 Lateran Pacts between Italy and the Holy See, which established Vatican City as a sovereign state, said Vatican City would be “invariably and in every event considered as neutral and inviolable territory”.https://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/02/17/pope-immunity_n_2708518.html

             There's more to it than this. People think of the Church like a giant multinational corporation, with the pope as the CEO who can fire people. But that isn't really how it works. There is a thing called "

             " which has been the tradition of Catholic church governance since the days of the Apostles themselves that gives almost all the power to the local bishops. The Bishop of Rome (the pope) has always been seen as the lead bishop, but only in the past couple hundred years has he had any administrative power.

              He's a little more than lead bishop:
             </p>
             <p>
              Pope (eccles. Lat., papa from Gr. papas, a variant of pappas, father; in classical Latin pappas—Juvenal, "Satires", vi, 633), the. The title pope, once used with far greater latitude (see below, section V), is at present employed solely to denote the Bishop of Rome, who, in virtue of his position as successor of St. Peter, is the chief pastor of the whole Church, the Vicar of Christ upon earth. Besides the bishopric of the Roman Diocese, certain other dignities are held by the pope as well as the supreme and universal pastorate: he is Archbishop of the Roman Province; Primate of Italy and the adjacent islands, and sole Patriarch of the Western Church. The Church's doctrine as to the pope was authoritatively declared in the Vatican Council in the Constitution "Pastor Aeternus" (1870)The four chapters of that Constitution deal respectively with the office of Supreme Head conferred on St. Peter, the perpetuity of this office in the person of the Roman pontiff, the pope's jurisdiction over the faithful, and his supreme authority to define in all questions of faith and morals
.
              <a href="https://www.catholic.com/encyclopedia/pope">
               https://www.catholic.com/encyclopedia/pope
              </a>
             </p>
             <p>
              The Bishop of Rome's jurisdiction extends over all Christendom. He is first in both authority and honor
 --The Pope has supreme and complete power and jurisdiction to decide questions of faith and morals and to arrange the discipline of the universal Church.
             </p>
             <p>
              The power of the Pope extends over every single church, every single bishop and pastor, every one of the faithful. 
He may appoint and depose bishops, call councils, make and unmake laws, send missionaries, confer distinctions, privileges, and dispensations, and reserve sins to his own tribunal. 
The Pope is the supreme judge; to him belongs the last appeal in all cases. 
The Pope is the "teacher of all Christians", the "chief shepherd of the shepherds and their flocks". "Peter, standing up with the Eleven, lifted up his voice and spoke out to them ..." (Acts 2:14). The word "Pope" is derived from the Latin term papa, which means "Father".
             </p>
             <p>
              The Pope is independent of every temporal sovereign and of every spiritual power. He is responsible only to God.

              In the 1400-1600s Catholic Popes wielded immense power, issuing papal bulls that divided the world trade into spheres of influence; Pope Innocent III, born Lotario dei Conti di Segni reigned from 8 January 1198 to his death in 1216. Pope Innocent was one of the most powerful and influential of the medieval popes. He exerted a wide influence over the Christian states of Europe, claiming supremacy over all of Europe's kings. He was central in supporting the Catholic Church's reforms of ecclesiastical affairs through his decretals and the Fourth Lateran Council.

              Welcome Back, I am not giving up.  I have held on to God waiting and wondering if anything will happen to cast out the satanic infidels just like Jesus cast out the the elite money changers.  It is Our Church not theirs.  They have held us hostage long enough, not to mention Our Children.

             That's why we have capital punishment and the Electric Chair. Civilized societies have to have a way to eliminate the worst of criminals and use their fate to deter others. Anti-Pope Bergoglio recently changed Catholic Church teaching to make the death penalty "inadmissible". He knows what is coming, I imagine.

              I want to see the 1st State of these United States come out and vote for the inclusion of these priests in the death penalty.  If states have abolished the death penalty then let them be sentenced to the No Justice for Raping Priests Prison.  There will be No Mercy There.

             The cognitive dissonance is absolutely horrifying. Abusing the symbols of the Faith and the power of the priesthood to perpetrate and cover their crimes is a separate grave crime in addition to the sexual abuse.

              I have said many times that the first ones that pedophiles groom are themselves.  What we heard from this pervert is the Pedo Manifesto, imo.  They hear nothing we say, this sicko thinks that the Lord Jesus will save him because he has a rosary around his neck.  If this was not so sick, that would be laughable.  I think it is his last attempt before he knows he will be cast into the Fires of Hell.  He has spent his life raping children.  Jesus will have no Mercy for this perverted pedophile.

               Watching that video is enough to make any Catholic lose his/her faith, but you are right, it has the opposite effect on me. It makes me want to turn the Church upside down and shake out all the cockroaches trying to pervert what we hold most sacred. It makes me want to fight even harder, but I understand people who are scandalized and turn away: the fight or flight response.

                I too understand, for you and I are one of those that fight no matter how hard.  This is something that has always been within me.  I am going to insert singing my favorite old Latin hymns into my Prayers starting today.  I loved the old hymns and we sang them in church often.  I hated when they stopped the Latin Mass. It held a Special Sacred Aura for me. Another switcheroo.  Making it sound mundane and like everything else.

            The Catholic Church needs to go public, and purge it's ranks of all these fucking pedo's.  They must also assist in putting every single one of them away for life.

             Actually, KHK, naming and punishing them all IS Mercy -- obviously for the victims, faithful Catholics and good priests. But also for these fuckers themselves. These demonic assholes have become completely enslaved to their vices. Any punishment they receive here on earth that stops their behavior, even capital punishment that might force them to face the reality of who they are on the way to stand before the Big Chair fits squarely within the theological virtue of Mercy.

             Death penalty is appropriate for these crimes. Is it an accident that Pope Bergoglio recently changed the Catholic Catechism to condemn the death penalty as "inadmissible"..
