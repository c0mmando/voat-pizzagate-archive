<p>EDIT: Some comments from the original:
---------- <a href="https://voat.co/user/swordfish69">@swordfish69</a>:
I have a ~5000 word article about RED and these AIDS charities that I\'m almost done. There is plenty of evidence that they are involved in the global trade of illicit goods.</p>
<p>Allow me to get more to the point. British-backed AIDS charities are closely tied to the same London coffers that funded the original East India Company esp. the opium profits they gained in China during the 19th century. They are also the entry to what criminal celebrities see as the so-called &quot;Illuminati&quot;, primarily through the Elton John AIDS Foundation.</p>
<p>There is a distinctive pattern of opiates, AIDS and intervention they shill constantly, the latest victim being Russia. That\'s why you\'re hearing about the Russia AIDS conspiracies so much lately. It\'s also why Russians likely shot down a plane with dozens of AIDS scientists over Donetsk (and the west being mostly silent about it). There is a distinctively paramilitary air to what they do in conflict zones.</p>

            Its been suspected that HIV was a bioweapon for a long time.
           </p>
           <p>
            I have my reasons to believe this is plausible. HIV and its adaptations (such as specifically killing helper T cells which are the leaders of the host's immune system) seem to exist predominately to kill.

            I'm not allowed to start a discussion or I'm too stupid for it. + language problems. Sorry. Just found this. Has nothing to do with red shoes or Bono, but maybe someone could look into this. It's about HIV Pharmaceutical Companies and the Clintons.

Articel from September 2016 'HIV Pharmaceutical Companies Made Fortune's 'Change the World' List'. It mentions the collaboration between the Johnson &amp; Johnson and The Clinton Health Access Initiative at the end.(

             I agree that CHAI needs a closer look. CHAI  was colluding with big pharma to leverage high drug prices for the US market and peddling watered down drugs in Africa and other areas.  there were also some posts alleging that  CHAI was actually deliberately infecting and spreading ebola.

              Just read through (
              <a href="https://www.gatesfoundation.org/">
               https://www.gatesfoundation.org/)
              </a>
              ). Had a translationbutton to my language. Yey. To me it was interesting, that (
              <a href="http://red.org/">
               http://red.org/)
              </a>
              ) links to the GF with a "special thanks". At the front page there, there is a picture of a woman trying to put a RED pill into a babys mouth. Beneath a guy in a purple robe. Somebody here mentioned a Soros connection. Hasn t the colour purple also a meaning? To me the gates site seemed like a modern concentration camp just in colour without any fences.
And they seem to "care" a lot about women and children, monitoring and vaccines, vaccines, vaccines. In the article I found about the pharmacompanies I also take a look to the number 1 company GlaxoSmithKline. GF mentioned them here (
              <a href="https://www.gatesfoundation.org/What-We-Do/Global-Health/Neglected-Tropical-Diseases">
               https://www.gatesfoundation.org/What-We-Do/Global-Health/Neglected-Tropical-Diseases)
              </a>
              ) (the opportunity §4).
Article from BBC about GlaxoSmithKline HIV experiment with New York Kids (
              <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/programmes/this_world/4038375.stm">
               http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/programmes/this_world/4038375.stm)
              </a>
              ). Seems like GSK has many access to much more children from day one of their birth through all of these foundations. And with the "special food" they (GF) "create", they controll nearly everything, what they put into the child`s system.

               Soros was trying to create a purple revolution in the US. Just after the election HRC and all the media were wearing purple. As for GF, and other foundations, I wonder what their motive and true objective is. I can't help be wonder if the current recent trend of transgender is a deliberate effect of these organizations. There was a post from NZ who said that male children were intentionally being given hormones to affect their growth so that they would stay attractive to pedophiles and child rapists longer(older) and I would not be surprised at all to learn that this is now happening globally without parents knowledge or consent through vaccines or other nutrition programs.

            The diagnostic tests for AIDS are notoriously unreliable. There is a video of a guy doing research on the tests. He discovered that you can go to two different hospitals and get two different diagnosis. One positive and one negative, because they use test kits from different companies.

              I read that one of the origins could be from the prostitutes and transgenders who work the meat packing district. They would walk through the district and get blood on their shoes. Some crafty shoe maker decided to make red shoes so it would hide the blood they walked through.

              This might be the origin of hookers and red shoes. If you add "meat packing" and "slaughter house" to that maybe it explains why Tony Podesta's boys and the Pope wear red shoes? The symbols for we walk amongst the slaughter, metaphorically speaking? I'm sure the meat packing district has gotten rid of it's share of dead bodies since they have all the machinery.

               Now the trademark of these particular shoes is the RED sole. Particularly named Chinese Red. Why red? Because in France, the  prostitutes would walk back to their flats in the early morning after a night of selling their wares,  through the meat packing district. Thereby getting blood on the bottom of their shoes. A cute little gimmick. Creepy, but kinda cute....

            we have threads that are for political cheerleading that have not a damn thing to do with Pizzagate, but you deleted one investigating an AIDS organization which are known to be corrupt. What the fuck? Sometimes I think you decide what to delete by throwing darts at it.

            <p>
             I have a ~5000 word article about RED and these AIDS charities that I'm almost done. There is plenty of evidence that they are involved in the global trade of illicit goods.
            </p>
            <p>
             Allow me to get more to the point. British-backed AIDS charities are closely tied to the same London coffers that funded the original East India Company esp. the opium profits they gained in China during the 19th century. They are also the entry to what criminal celebrities see as the so-called "Illuminati", primarily through the Elton John AIDS Foundation.

             There is a distinctive pattern of opiates, AIDS and intervention they shill constantly, the latest victim being Russia. That's why you're hearing about the Russia AIDS conspiracies so much lately. It's also why Russians likely shot down a plane with dozens of AIDS scientists over Donetsk (and the west being mostly silent about it). There is a distinctively paramilitary air to what they do in conflict zones.

            From red.org/our impact: "As soon as the infant is born, the baby should be given nevirapine daily for six weeks". In an articel I read, it said that the HIV test can be positiv even if you are just pregnant. So this would be a big $ + for Pharma. 
In the overview of Haiti at globalfund.org you find that the most $ get used for HIV/AIDS. also it says: "the number of HIV patients on anti-retroviral therapy has risen from 6,000 people in 2006 to currently 82,000 people.

            This was in the deleted post:  Product Red, stylized as (PRODUCT)RED, is a licensed brand owned by (RED) that seeks to engage the private sector in raising awareness and funds to help eliminate HIV/AIDS in eight African countries.[1] It is licensed to partner companies including Nike, American Express (UK), Apple Inc., The Coca-Cola Company, Starbucks, Converse, Electronic Arts, Head, Buckaroo, Penguin Classics (UK &amp; International), Gap, Armani, Hallmark (US), SAP, Beats Electronics, Supercell and the YouTube personality PewDiePie. The concept was founded in 2006 by U2 frontman and activist Bono, together with Bobby Shriver of the ONE Campaign and DATA. The Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria is a recipient of Product Red's money.  The KEY here is BONO who traveled to Africa with BILL Clinton to peddle the HIV/AIDS shots that were watered down 50%.  8chan posting on Red.org mentioned HIV/AIDS and Bono.  This Is a BIG DEAL, IMO.
