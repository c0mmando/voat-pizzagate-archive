<p>Let\'s add Walmart to the mix. And BP. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Wal-Mart had given at least $500,000 to CAP, according to Wal-Mart\'s Web site. But there was another connection: Tony Podesta was (and still is) a lobbyist for Wal-Mart, on issues that include health care policy. Wal-Mart had hired Podesta in September 2006 (the firm was then called Podesta Mattoon), just about when CAP, Big Labor, and Wal-Mart started &quot;work[ing] closely in support of health care reform.&quot; </p>
<p>Tony has represented BP since 2006, recently lobbying for current climate legislation. BP was a prized ally for Sen. John Kerry, who is leading the charge in the Senate for a global warming bill. 
According to the Wall Street Journal, John Podesta is nearly writing the president\'s response to the BP spill. While Obama hasn\'t coddled BP, he is using the spill to advance the climate legislation BP supports and for which Tony Podesta has been lobbying. </p>

<p>Google, for its part, created an exclusively Chinese search engine that only a Joseph Goebbels could love. Type in any number of  vile words like human rights, or Tian An Men Square massacre, or Falun Gong, and you will get rerouted to government propaganda – much of it heavily anti-American and anti- President Bush, and filled with hate, especially for the Falun Gong. How did Google respond to our deep concern about their enabling a dictatorship to expand its hate message? <strong>They hired big-time Washington lobbying firms like Podesta-Mattoon and the DCI group to put a good face on it all –</strong> and presumably kill my pending legislation, the Global Online Freedom Act of 2006.</p>

<p>In the first half of 2005, Podesta Mattoon’s Hastert lobbied on behalf of vaccine maker Chiron on “avian flu issues” and at least two vaccine-related bills. Each bill would have provided a liability shield for drug makers.81 </p>

<p>Be sure to search the doc for podesta. See who was there. Who they represent. Here\'s one company <a href="http://archive.is/gc1YH">http://archive.is/gc1YH</a> Chiron Corporation. Guess what they do?  
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Chiron Corporation was an American multinational biotechnology firm based in Emeryville, California that was acquired by Novartis International AG on April 20, 2006. It had offices and facilities in eighteen countries on five continents. Chiron\'s business and research was in three main areas: biopharmaceuticals, vaccines, and blood testing. Chiron\'s vaccines and blood testing units were combined to form Novartis Vaccines and Diagnostics, while Chiron BioPharmaceuticals was integrated into NovartisPharmaceuticals. In 2014, Novartis completed the sale of its blood transfusion diagnostics unit (&quot;Novartis Diagnostics&quot;) to Grifols, S.A.(Barcelona, Spain) and announced agreements for the sale of its vaccines unit (&quot;Novartis Vaccines&quot;).</p>

<p>Now I want to pause here just a minute. Something I\'ve noticed throughout this investigation is the references to comets, stars and other objects related to space and Greek mythology. Nova is another one I have taken note of. Guess what this company name means? </p>
<p>In Greek mythology, Chiron was held to be the superlative centaur amongst his brethren, as he was called as the &quot;wisest and justest of all the centaurs&quot;</p>

<p>Another Podesta-Mattoon connection </p>
<blockquote>
<p>I have four children who each have their own careers. Michael is a pilot for Jet Blue Airlines, T.J. is a pilot for Continental, Don II recently graduated from Southern Methodist University Law School and <strong>Shannon is the director of marketing at Podesta Mattoon.</strong> I have five grandchildren, three girls and two boys.</p>
<p>i have previously been employed as an Obstetric and Pediatric Nursing Instructor, Psychiatric Nurse Manager, Case Manager with certifications as Pediatric Advanced Life Support Instructor (PALS), Neonatal Resuscitation Program Instructor (NRP), International Board Certified Lactation Consultant (IBCLC) and a Maternal/Child Clinical Nurse Specialist (CNS). I have been a Director of Professional Development, and Director of Women’s and Children’s Services, before being hired as the Director of Women’s Services at OSF Saint Francis Medical Center.</p>
<p>I developed the first postpartum clinic at OSF Saint Anthony Medical Center during the time women were being discharged from maternity units within 24 hours after delivery. I love to travel so when I was asked to lead international missions to China, Australia and South Africa for the International Scholar Laureate Program between 2002 and 2005, I accepted immediately. I firmly believe the way we will achieve peace in this world is through the understanding of other cultures and I enjoyed facilitating that understanding.</p>

<p>Back to the dentist. He promoted fluoridation of water. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Local dentist and businessman, founder of Mattoon Dental Group and promoted fluoridation of the Mattoon water supply, established dental hygiene and dental assisting program at Lake Land College, road around campus is named Dr. Podesta Drive. Lake Land sits on land owned by Podesta, served in WWII and for a short time was President Ronald Reagan\'s commanding officer, one of five civic leaders responsible for the building of the National Guard Armory, built Maison Blanche (dental office) and La Casa Rosa buildings.

           <p>
            Hi littered --
           </p>
           <p>
            Well a whole lot here to be taken in which will probably require a lot of re-reading,
but I'm thinking about it all.
           </p>
           <p>
            My overall feeling at the moment, is that money = power and these guys are all looking for it, 
and that they're a cut or two above those who actually have to produce a product to make $$.
           </p>
           <p>
            They're also vying, imo, with the guys above them who share control over the nation's secrets
and the great diversion of the nation's wealth in order to protect those secrets and exploit them.
And these guys want in.
           </p>
           <p>
            Two different sides of the coin -- one Global Warming, the other UFO's/ET's -- but they are looking
to cash in, to exploit.
           </p>
           <p>
            That's not at all to be confused with people/organizations legitimately trying to alert us to
the dangers of Global Warming and melting glaciers, and weather systems which can be
changed by Global Warming and where there is no way to predict how all of those changes 
to our weather systems and patterns may compound and what the consequences may be
as our scientists have made clear.
           </p>
           <p>
            Same with UFO's/ET's -- seems clear that the original reactions by some were disgust and great
fear and a desire for arming the nation to combat the intruders.
            <br/>
            See:
            <em>
             The Day After Roswell by Lt. Col. Philip Corso
            </em>
           </p>
           <p>
            Note that the original book had a foreword by Senator Strom Thurmond who told more truth than
he later liked and when the heat was on he tried to deny that he knew what the book was about
or what he had written.
           </p>
           <p>
            Some who may have known more of the past long history of hundreds of thousands of years of 
alien visitation to this planet and mining of our natural resources and exploitation of our animal-life 
may have been more eager to partner with this greater intelligence to make it work for the few.
            <br/>
            That would involve working in secret with them and diverting a lot of the nation's wealth to that effort.
           </p>
           <p>
            There is also the question of some perhaps knowing that Germany had produced atomic
weapons which US is said to have found at the end of WWII . . .
            <br/>
            and US suspicions that Hitler had been working with aliens and had produced UFO's.
           </p>
           <p>
            On both issues and there have always been those who argued for telling the truth and 
releasing information, but they lost out obviously to those who maintained secrecy.
           </p>
           <p>
            Just want to mention that in the picture of "The Education of Achilles by Chiron" that 
Achilles looks at the least confused and wary if not frightened.
           </p>
           <p>
            Seems like Hastert and Scalia were doing the same things ... moving their kids along.

             I just posted that on Part 1.  Don't worry.  Hastert got 15 months, so I am sure he learned his lesson and will never do it again.

              OK I did a search for Hastert on the first page, must have been in a link I didn't notice.

               Oh, no worries!  I am just pointing it out so that the dot is clearly connected for future readers.  I am glad that you also posted it.  It tells me that people are more aware.
