            Somebody correct me if I'm wrong but.......this post suggests that the reason for the symbol placement could have been to advertise a ring to buy/sell, correct? It then also suggests that Santa Clara in the movie is a reference to Santa Cruz CA. Take a look at the left side of that photo. There is a flyer that clearly states Sept. 10-15 Santa Cruz County Fairgrounds.
           </p>
           <p>
            Could have been a big kid swap going on that weekend. :(
           </p>
           <p>
            Edit: Also, I can't make out the flyer below that one that reads 'Shiny? Vinnie's Cafe". Could have been a meeting place.
           </p>
           <p>
            2nd Edit: I would also suggest looking into more symbology and clues in the rest of Schumacher's movies. I say so because of the many cast members of his who have accused Hollywood of being full of pedophiles. With such an obvious sign in this film of his I would bet he has done it in his other films as well.

             Most of the movie is filmed in Santa Cruz. Santa Clara is like 15 minutes away from there.

              Are you suggesting that bulletin board was a local one and possibly both the CP symbol and the Fairgrounds flyer were already present?

            Not sure if linked, stumbled across this a while back... Reference to:  "The Lost Boys".
           </p>
           <p>
            Meet: Dean Corll
           </p>
           <p>
            "Between 1970 and 1973, Corll is known to have killed a minimum of 28 victims. All of his victims were males aged 13 to 20, the majority of whom were in their mid-teens.
           </p>
           <p>
            Corll's victims were usually lured into one of two vehicles he owned, a Ford Econoline van or a Plymouth GTX, with an offer of a party or a lift, and then driven to his house.There, they were plied with alcohol or other drugs until they passed out, tricked into putting on handcuffs, or simply grabbed by force. They were then stripped naked and tied to either Corll's bed or, usually, a plywood torture board, which was regularly hung on a wall. Once manacled, the victims would be sexually assaulted, beaten, tortured and—sometimes after several days—killed by strangulation or shooting with a .22-caliber pistol. Their bodies were then tied in plastic sheeting and buried in any one of four places: a rented boat shed; a beach on the Bolivar Peninsula; a woodland near Lake Sam Rayburn (where Corll's family owned a lakeside log cabin); or a beach in Jefferson County.
           </p>
           <p>
            The suspicion is that Corll may have begun killing much earlier than 1970, and may also have been abusing youths prior to this date.
           </p>
           <p>
            During a routine investigation in March 1975, the Houston police discovered a cache of pornographic pictures and films depicting young boys. Of the 16 individuals depicted within the films and photos, 11 of the youths appeared to be among the 21 victims of Dean Corll who had been identified by this date.
           </p>
           <p>
            Forty-two boys had vanished within the Houston area since 1970.The police were heavily criticized for curtailing the search for further victims once the record set by Juan Corona for having the most victims had been surpassed. After finding the 26th and 27th bodies, tied together, at High Island Beach, the search was terminated on August 13, 1973, despite Henley's insistence that two further bodies had been buried on the beach in 1972.
           </p>
           <ul>
            <li>
             Those boys who went missing around this time, that were never found are refered to as "The Lost Boys"
            </li>
