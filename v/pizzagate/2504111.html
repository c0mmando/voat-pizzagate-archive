<h1>Facebook - the CIA conspiracy</h1>
<h1>8 Aug, 2007 3:09pm :</h1>
<p>The social networking phenomenon started as a way of American college students to keep in touch. It is rapidly catching up with MySpace, and has left others like Bebo in its wake.</p>
<p>But there is a dark side to the success story that\'s been spreading across the blogosphere. A complex but riveting Big Brother-type conspiracy theory which links Facebook to the CIA and the US Department of Defence.</p>
<p>The CIA is, though, using a Facebook group to recruit staff for its very sexy sounding National Clandestine Service.</p>
<p>Checking out the job ads
does require a Facebook login, so if you haven\'t joined the site - or are worried that CIA spooks will start following you home from work -check them out on the agency\'s own site.</p>
<p>The story starts once Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg had launched, after the dorm room drama that\'s led to the current court case.</p>
<p>Facebook\'s first round of venture capital funding ($US500,000) came from former Paypal CEO Peter Thiel. Author of anti-multicultural tome \'The Diversity Myth\', he is also on the board of radical conservative group VanguardPAC.</p>
<p>The second round of funding into Facebook ($US12.7 million) came from venture capital firm Accel Partners. Its manager James Breyer was formerly chairman of the National Venture Capital Association, and served on the board with Gilman Louie, CEO of In-Q-Tel, a venture capital firm established by the Central Intelligence Agency in 1999. One of the company\'s key areas of expertise are in &quot;data mining technologies&quot;.</p>
<p>Breyer also served on the board of R&amp;D firm BBN Technologies, which was one of those companies responsible for the rise of the internet.</p>
<p>Dr Anita Jones joined the firm, which included Gilman Louie. She had also served on the In-Q-Tel\'s board, and had been director of Defence Research and Engineering for the US Department of Defence.</p>
<p>She was also an adviser to the Secretary of Defence and overseeing the Defence Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), which is responsible for high-tech, high-end development.</p>
<p>It was when a journalist lifted the lid on the DARPA\'s
Information Awareness Office that the public began to show concern at its information mining projects.</p>
<p>Wikipedia\'s IAO page says: &quot;the IAO has the stated mission to gather as much information as possible about everyone, in a centralised location, for easy perusal by the United States government, including (though not limited to) internet activity, credit card purchase histories, airline ticket purchases, car rentals, medical records, educational transcripts, driver\'s licenses, utility bills, tax returns, and any other available data.&quot;.</p>
<p>Not surprisingly, the backlash from civil libertarians led to a Congressional investigation into DARPA\'s activity, the Information Awareness Office lost its funding.</p>
<p>Now the internet conspiracy theorists are citing Facebook as the IAO\'s new mask.</p>
<p>Parts of the IAO\'s technology round-up included \'human network analysis and behaviour model building engines\', which Facebook\'s massive volume of neatly-targeted data gathering allows for.</p>
<p>Facebook\'s own Terms of use state: &quot;by posting Member Content to any part of the Web site, you automatically grant, and you represent and warrant that you have the right to grant, to facebook an irrevocable, perpetual, non-exclusive, transferable, fully paid, worldwide license to use, copy, perform, display, reformat, translate, excerpt and distribute such information and content and to prepare derivative works of, or incorpoate into other works, such information and content, and to grant and authorise sublicenses of the foregoing.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Again, note that date: #2007!!!! That is way before the debunked conspiracy theory named pizzagate got loose and red-pilled those willing to listen. But part of that wild nutso conspiracy is not getting through. Please take a look at a couple of Q\'s posts to establish more proof. I’m referring to the term \'\'CLOWN(S)\'. That code\' refers to rogue CIA operatives: </p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/prayingmedic/status/962822285370343424">https://twitter.com/prayingmedic/status/962822285370343424</a></p>
<p>6) #Qanon says: Since Clown (CIA) takedown of black_ops loc/public exposure what has changed here? (I\'m not sure yet.) Expand your thinking. This is not a game. RED_OCTOBER.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It\'s blatantly obvious that Clown is a code word for CIA thanks to Q including the breakdown. So how does this relate to FB? How am I tying this in? By posts such as these: </p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://rabbitcrumbs.com/">https://rabbitcrumbs.com/</a></p>

</blockquote>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>There you go! The full meaning of Clown is a Rogue CIA operative. And in case you didn’t catch the ‘Bombs Away’ reference, that’s what the bombing in Syria was all about. Those caches of chemical weapons had to be destroyed. But in case you need more proof of getting rid of CIA rogue involvement, we can get it this from another Q post: </p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://www.exopolitics.org/qanon-corroborates-hawaii-missile-attack-hunt-for-rogue-cia-submarine/">https://www.exopolitics.org/qanon-corroborates-hawaii-missile-attack-hunt-for-rogue-cia-submarine/</a></p>
<p>Ask yourself “would the PUBLIC understand the following statement: Rogue actors (Clowns/US former heads of State) initiated a missile launch in order to ‘force’ the US into a WAR/conflict against X?”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>With this code established we move on to another Q post that hints at one of the real uses of FB: </p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://qanonposts.com/?q=honey">https://qanonposts.com/?q=honey</a></p>

Facebook. IG (think Ray.Chandler). Twitter. Etc….. HONEYPOTS. Q</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There it is. Ray Chandler and the term \'\'HONEYPOTS&quot;. That’s a word we all know. You see now why FB might possibly have been suggesting child pornography to users?  More proof of CIA involvement? Well, there’s this coinkydink: </p>

<p>And before I run out of space in this post, here’s a mention of Paul Ceglia, the true creator of FB and a brief summary of how that turned him into a fugitive running for his life. Starting to sound like Randy Quaid running from them there ‘’Star Whackers’’. </p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/social-media/court-tosses-out-facebook-lawsuit-against-fugitive-paul-ceglia-s-n487476">https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/social-media/court-tosses-out-facebook-lawsuit-against-fugitive-paul-ceglia-s-n487476</a></p>
<h1>Court Tosses Out Facebook Lawsuit Against Fugitive Paul Ceglia\'s Lawyers</h1>
<p>A New York state appeals court on Tuesday threw out Facebook\'s unusual malicious prosecution lawsuit against DLA Piper and other law firms that have represented a fugitive who claimed a 50 percent stake in the social media company.
Reversing a lower court ruling that favored Facebook and Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg, the Appellate Division in Manhattan found a lack of evidence that the law firms knew or should have known that the case of their client, Paul Ceglia, was fraudulent and based on fabricated evidence.
Ceglia, 42, a wood pellet salesman from Wellsville, New York, sued Facebook and Zuckerberg in June 2010, alleging that a 2003 contract for Zuckerberg to do programming for his company Street Fax entitled him to half of Facebook.</p>

            Facebook's first round of venture capital funding ($US500,000) came from former Paypal CEO Peter Thiel. Author of anti-multicultural tome 'The Diversity Myth', he is also on the board of radical conservative group VanguardPAC.

           There it is. Ray Chandler and the term ''HONEYPOTS". That’s a word we all know. You see now why FB might possibly have been suggesting child pornography to users?  More proof of CIA involvement? Well, there’s this coinkydink:

           And before I run out of space in this post, here’s a mention of Paul Ceglia, the true creator of FB and a brief summary of how that turned him into a fugitive running for his life. Starting to sound like Randy Quaid running from them there ‘’Star Whackers’’.

            Court Tosses Out Facebook Lawsuit Against Fugitive Paul Ceglia's Lawyers
           </h1>
           <p>
            A New York state appeals court on Tuesday threw out Facebook's unusual malicious prosecution lawsuit against DLA Piper and other law firms that have represented a fugitive who claimed a 50 percent stake in the social media company.
Reversing a lower court ruling that favored Facebook and Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg, the Appellate Division in Manhattan found a lack of evidence that the law firms knew or should have known that the case of their client, Paul Ceglia, was fraudulent and based on fabricated evidence.
Ceglia, 42, a wood pellet salesman from Wellsville, New York, sued Facebook and Zuckerberg in June 2010, alleging that a 2003 contract for Zuckerberg to do programming for his company Street Fax entitled him to half of Facebook.

            It's great that you are bringing up the connections between the intelligence services and technology for those who are unaware.  I just want to point out that Q is not giving out new information in this regard.  Those of us who got our computing degrees in the early days of the internet, knew then the origins of the internet and the surveillance capabilities.  When we advised people with webcams when they first started coming out to cover the camera lens when not in use, we were laughed at for being 'conspiracy theorists'. But it was a common practice within academia and those who were actually qualified to know the truth.  I'm becoming increasingly convinced that we are only being offered breadcrumbs while Trump engages in his illegal war in the Middle East.  Go look up who is on the board of GENIE ENERGY.

             Hey, appreciate your insights. I do disagree, in that, Q is offering us names and specific info and/or topics that our POTUS mentions either the next day or within a few days timeframe. I think the most notable is our POTUS using the phrase ''tippy-top''.

             There can't be any coincidence. It's such an unusual wording to use and no one uses it -- especially not our POTUS.

            <p>

             You're just not getting what was done. To begin with he inherited that war and it's not his. Secondly, he had no choice but to get rid of the warehouses storing chemical weapons. You know, the weapons that The Kenyan assured weren't there? They are there thanks to clowns or rogue CIA agents interference and this is a tactical shutdown of clowns that are enabling this cabal. They enabled/funded the problems with FB, Twitter, Google, etc.
            </p>
            <p>
             I've had my wake up call as concerns Q and am never turning back on it. Not even with the Stormy Daniels covfefe. I asserted she was working for our POTUS and advancing the plan, but then started to get chest pains when the recent events such as the raiding of Cohen's office took place. But it is part of the plan. I have faith in The Plan. You don't, and I readily accept that and understand why you or anyone else wouldn't.
            </p>
            <p>
             But it is happening.
            </p>
            <p>
             Again, thanks for your remarks and support.
