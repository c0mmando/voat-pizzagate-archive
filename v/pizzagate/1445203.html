<p>Well, Capital Pizza is now closed. But in its place, sharing the same address: <a href="http://www.sicilianpizzadc.net/location.aspx">Sicilian Pizza</a></p>
<p>Notice the &quot;33&quot; in their logo. A satanic link. 
Look at the menu and their vague descriptions of their menu items, but continuos us of pizza, pasta etc..
And last but not least....the REVIEWS. check that out.</p>

            Good find, anything on why they closed? Might be insightful into what went down.
