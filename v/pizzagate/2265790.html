            Of course Kinsey's theories were presented at UCLA classes. However I never knew his experiments dealt with children until just now.
           </p>
           <p>
            He was evidently pushing a bisexuality continuum which many questioned for years and years afterwards. The issue is his definition of sexual experimentation and under what circumstances. Meaning those incarcerated have high rates of homosexual behavior. Does it continue once released? 
Was his overall study sample really accurate and representative of all Americans? Doubtful.

            Thank you very much for your post.  So many of my friends were in college and were fooled by Kinsey.  I didn't go to college, so I was out in left field when it came to the Kinsey Report, although I had heard of it.  I have read reports on here about what was done to those children and it just breaks your heart.  I am not a fan of Jeff Bezos or Amazon so I hope to get this report somewhere else, Barnes and Noble.  I hope Dr. Reisman is successful in convincing Congress to take a look at this.  They owe it to the American People and those poor children and their parents.

             It just pained me to rad that entire letter, but I did.  What a horror that must have been to face that for her entire life. The UN is backing this all because those at the head are part of the Normalizing and Brainwashing of the Public.  All this was also learned in college by students decades ago and maybe still. Blasphemous Lies.  Stop Kinsey Now.  She is an Angel.

             In the first link all I can say is This is beyond disgusting!  I am going to vomit.  A 2 yr old has 11 orgasms?  How do they know?  Did they do what I think they did to these poor little children?  That is sexual abuse.  What right do they have to use these children to do experiments, and for what purpose. I feel icky even reading it.  Are any of those poor children still living?  This is a crime against them.  There must be restitution.  It is a form of rape.  Oh God.
