<p><strong>ONE THING THAT I HAD BEEN VERY CURIOUS IS WHAT WOULD THE PARKING SITUATION BE LIKE FOR THE CURRENT TENANTS OF 1644 NORTH CAPITAL NW?</strong></p>
<p>I was guessing that this would be behind the building. I was really curious about what the back of the building looked like today. I did a Google Maps search and it provided a very outdated view (from 2009). It essentially showed that there was nothing in the alley behind the building.</p>
<p>Then I viewed another post that had a map using Bing. So I decided to give Bing a try and VOILA! I found a much more recent street view and it answered a lingering question of mine of what is currently in the alley behind the building. If you look at the BING view and zoom in, you can see a fence with a gate (and also looks like some construction equipment behind the gate). </p>
<p>Remember, the 1644 North Capital project employed AG Contracting Services as the general contractor.</p>

            It's pretty clear that Alefantis doesn't want people digging into Pegasus, so when something gets downvoated straight away I wonder if it's Alefantis and friends doing the downvoating.

              I can't believe there are Alefantis Instragrams I still haven't seen. How many more can there be? Anyway these posts are very interesting and do seem to prove that the watchtower is specifically for the purpose of watching kids play in the trolley park. What else could it be for?

            You are really good at establishing connections through property.  Have you thought to look behind the various churches and orphanages etc in Washington DC to see who actually owns them.  Moonies, Freemasons and Catholic Churches. Look at how many catholic churches there are and they are big on orphanages too. Wonder if they are pretty much the same thing and ultimately working toward the NWO of no bible etc? This seems like an endless bad dream.

            i did some research on the current residents of the 1644 north capital building when the scheve transfer of pegasus came to light, and couldn't find any solid connections.  other than being a property owned/willed by scheve and sold by hubbard, is it associated with pegasus/alefantis in any way?
           </p>
           <p>
            what i mean to say is, i understand that alefantis bought the pegasus building from the trust, but that's it...i can share some of my presumed dead-end research on 1644 if you have a real reason to connect the two beyond the scheve link.

               Doubting and skepticism is a good thing! Skepticism is what got me started on the Pegasus route!
              </p>
              <p>
               Someone made a note of that figure in the past post. I think it is from an art exhibit that was held in the steet level part of the building in 2016. Don't quite know what to make of it.
              </p>
              <p>
               BTW, I'm not sure on what archiving solution is best. Trying to figure that out. If you have a recommendation, let me know.

             ( hint:  the owner of the 1644 property worked for the state department from 2007 to 2015.  I just found that my archive.is links for his projects and for his linkedin page have been deleted, and
