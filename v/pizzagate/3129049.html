            "Called to the stand in Sullivan’s defense last week, Packer surprised the court by saying Sullivan was the one who wanted to rape Grace.
“I got caught up in Jake’s fantasy,” she told the jury. “I didn’t think I could say no without losing him.”
Packer’s attorneys, Keith Williams and John Fioravanti, offered little evidence. Fioravanti told the judge that Packer was the editor of her yearbook at Pleasant Valley High School, and was described by one teacher as a brilliant student."
           </p>
           <p>
            Absolutely disgusting that she tries to rewrite the story to make herself look more compassionate. And knowing our culture, it will be bought by the common people who can't believe a female is capable of rape. Of course they are, they just know how to lie about it afterwards. It's social manipulation as females are observed doing at all levels of society (it's a female instinct).

            From layperson's perspective it would seem her gender is preventing her from getting actual justice aka the death penalty.

           <p>
            Strange...but I remember listening to one of Jay Parker's (SRA survivor from Arden, DE) that his mother, a generational Satanist, had told him that any town/city that ended in the suffix, -ton, was founded by Satanists.  He said she told him it was tribute to Aton (also Aten), the Egyptian god or sun disk or whatever.  I never did any digging on that tidbit, but now &amp; then it comes to mind; i.e., Northamp-TON, East-TON,  not to mention WashingTON (D.C).   Things that make you go hmmm....

            "Watch out for Kristen Cooper and Jared Myers there both corrupted Kristen tryed to fabricate info in my case and i proofed to the detective that she was committing perjury along with the doctor she deals with. Im taking them to court on 3/15/19 to proof my innocence and have them prosecuted for falsification on my case!"
           </p>
           <p>
            "Beware, the caseworker magoline Oconnor In 2001 - 2002 destroyed my life and greatly affected my sons life as well!  Definitely tell them you wish too talk to a lawyer first if they knock on your door. In a meeting her and her supervisor were intimidating me and when I said ide like too speak with a attorney the supervisor stood up and screamed at me saying “you will never see your child again if you do that”! I have witnesses on this also. They also encouraged me and my girlfriend at the time too split up saying we weren’t right for each other and they pushed that! That’s exactly what ended up happening. Yes I had issues at the time but they never even offered me help that I did end up getting later. I never hurt, neglected, or abused my child… never. I had a drug problem! Thing was they had no idea untill I told them that. They were there for another minor issue caused by someone else. I ended up getting help on my own after a family was torn apart and it was years later that I met my son for the first time. If they actually helped me get too a rehab and pointed me in the right direction, things would have been better for my son as well. It was horrible what they did. They encouraged 2 parents too not be together too raise a child. They should be ashamed.! Today I am clean and I help fellow recovering addicts. It’s a disease, a disability. Help should have been offered! It’s very hard for me to pubically admit this, but I need too warn parents out there. You can have a revengeful neighbor report you on a bogus complaint and if you say the wrong thing, it can be used against you. They can make your life a living hell out of a bogus complaint. Also this is Northampton county. I had a previous expirence with Lehigh county and they were very nice and helpful!"
           </p>
           <p>
            "This Child protective services did not pursue or even check into well being of child that is slowly dying due to her mothers habits of smoking meth in the house along with cigarettes and pot. When the doctors told her it could kill her and the other kids. All three children suffer severe respiratory issues yet this so called mother gets to keep these kids while slowly killing all of them!"
