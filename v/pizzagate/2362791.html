<p>For those of you already familiar with this story I believe that we are possibly dealing with UK links to pizzagate.  Right now the scandal of this \'men only\' charity event is being played out in the media as a story about sexism.  But looking at the attendees and the tables that they were seated at paints a potentially more interesting story. I\'ll have to make a couple of posts about this but I\'ll just start with this:</p>
<p>Harvey Soning - trustee of the Presidents Club charity <a href="https://www.thejc.com/news/uk-news/jcoss-chair-of-trustees-resigns-after-link-to-presidents-club-emerges-1.457412">JCoSS chair of trustees resigns after link to Presidents Club emerges</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The chairman of trustees of a Jewish school has stepped down after his senior position at the Presidents Club emerged.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Harvey sold his cleaning and security company last year.  Cheltenhem is spy centre for the UK.  Cleaning and security - interesting combo, don\'t you think?</p>

             Yes.  And the event has been going for 33 years.  There are reports that events in previous years had 'hostesses' wearing sashes of different colours which would indicate who was up for sex or not.  I was very disturbed when i saw high ranking members of the education sector there.  I believe that story broke in the FT for a number of reasons.
