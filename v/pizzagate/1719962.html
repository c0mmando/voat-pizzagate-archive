<p>Next, I found a 2nd woman, Allyson Grey spelled slightly different.  She is a psychedelic artist, into occult symbolism &amp; is pro lsd. She may be a handler.

She shows up on the SYNT website here.  <a href="http://imgur.com/0EowCOh">http://imgur.com/0EowCOh</a> 
Futher digging, I found a youtube account matching the SYNT site. It has a video called &quot;childhood 3.&quot;  This women is in the video and Bay Ridge Brooklyn is delibertly pointed out. <a href="https://youtu.be/ACrDN2_vu0s">https://youtu.be/ACrDN2_vu0s</a>.

<p>Anyways, back to the site. There is hundreds of encrypted documents in reguards to Maddie. I can not crack. These pictures came from those documents.  <a href="http://imgur.com/0M7S4QL">http://imgur.com/0M7S4QL</a>

<p>There is also a small clip of 2 women intimate together. I believe one of the females could be HRC. Is the second Maddie or the Allison women? <a href="http://imgur.com/fXQL0Mq">http://imgur.com/fXQL0Mq</a></p>
