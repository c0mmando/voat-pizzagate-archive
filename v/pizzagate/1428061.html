            and pick out user names divvied up alphabetically or something and send them each a private message letting them know about

             how are you planning to contact all those people? Those who post on subbredit frequently will be well informed about this but how do you want to reach those who don't post or comment? I'm glad to help there is just too many people and just about half an hour of time
