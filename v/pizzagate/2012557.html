            Although this site is criticized as a disinfo site because it reports on Russian intelligence SVR many have been found to be true. This gives a list of what the WSJ was meeting with Russian consulate about. It names the companies. The illegal takeovers, the Clinton emails, and also the links to some of the same ex Russian Oligarchs Vladimir Putin got rid of who were now involved in the Don jr. Set up with the "Russian Lawyer"  by Fusion GPS who now have Plead the Fifth to Congress from self incrimination.

            So let's look at your evidence.
A.  The guy who died criticized Obamacare.
           </p>
           <p>
            So?
           </p>
           <p>
            Obamacare passed and is the law of the land years ago.  Perhaps you've heard about that.  So he represents a zero% of chance of stopping Obamacare.  And he was one of hundreds of conservative writers who critized Obamacare.  Personally I had never heard of him before.
           </p>
           <p>
            B.  He criticized Jeff Bezos.
           </p>
           <p>
            Seriously?   So Bezos had him killed?  Podesta had him killed to impress Bezos?  That's the theory?
           </p>
           <p>
            C.  He wrote about child porn.  And?  I did some sleuthing and found out the article you cite on child porn is not primarily focused on child porn.  It's about terrorism.  Look at the clue I found.  It's right at top of the page.

            Also don't think it would make more sense to kill the Algorithm Expert?  Because killing the reporter stops nothing.  The work would go on.

             A well respected and award winning journalist who reports on sensitive political stories of the day is found dead at the age of 34.  We have a responsibility as a society to have the back of people like him and scrutinize the circumstances surrounding his death and not hold back because of appeals to inauthentic sentimentality and snivelling comments like yours.

              Get over yourself. You want new fuel for your silly conspiracy and don't care how ridiculous and jerry-rigged a scaffolding you have to climb to do so.
You have zero information about the this man died.

               I'm open to the idea that the Russian Consulate appointment is disinformation.  As a matter of fact, I've begun to wonder if that is the case because of the sources that I've now seen so far.  What I don't have respect for is oiks like you that spend their time on forums throwing insults around. And that's the reason I won't be responding to you again. Piss off.

            "A Wall Street Journal Editor who was investigating how a Russian Pharmaceutical firm could have been purchased in 2014 by an American Pharmaceutical firm while Sanctions against Russia existed against such business transactions, has been found dead in his New York City apartment.  The crux of the dead journalists investigation was how then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton influenced the transaction to be finalized, but only AFTER her husband Bill was paid $500,000 for giving a speech in Moscow.
           </p>
           <p>
            The Russia Consulate General’s office in New York City was contacted by Wall Street Journal reporter/editor Joseph Rago who requested a Thursday (20 July) in person interview with consular officials regarding an upcoming article he was preparing on Hillary Clinton and her links to Russia. Rago failed to attend the meeting and was later discovered dead in his apartment of as yet “unknown causes” just hours prior to this meeting occurring."- more...

             That 1st paragraph....fck me at the criminality.....and that is why Trump has turned into a failure....his actions are those of someone who doesnt understand the strength required to take down an enemy so wicked.  They're going to eat him fcking alive unless he steps it up.

             Once again - substitute in the 1st paragraph Trump for Hillary Clinton to see how fcked the agenda against Trimp is.

            WSJ is honestly fantastic. Highly recommend them. Only $4/mo if you're a student. It's MSM, sure, but their finance section is unparalleled and their news section tends to remain fairly neutral.

            From Rago's WSJ article, and maybe worthy of its own post - certainly paved the way for Elsagate -
            <strong>
             "In 2002 the U.S. Supreme Court struck down a ban on “virtual” child porn—computer-generated images that “appear to depict minors but were produced without using any real children.”
            </strong>
            Mr. Farid is sometimes brought in as an outside expert when a defendant claims the material at issue is virtual.

             you can't appeal the supreme court. its the end of the line, congress could try to outlaw it with a statute but the  court might find it unconstitutional (free speech) and we're back at square one.

             It's like tires. You never notice the tires on other vehicles until after you invest a shit ton of $ into new tires. Suddenly then, all you notice is other peoples' tires. It's not like they weren't there before, you just weren't focused on them.

             I can't access the entire WSJ article either but you can see the topic in the headlines. Also, the YT video mentions his attention to child porn..found it on godlikeproductions too.  I'm hoping that other researchers will find more.

             Seymour Hersh also wrote about it.  He is still alive.  I think it was the pedophile researching that caused his demise, although I think you are right in part.  Two reasons.  Killing two birds with one stone.

               They are involved in so many things it would be hard to guess.  It could have been human trafficking since he wrote that article about CP and knew how the system worked.  I would bet on that. So many deaths this week.  They said that would happen.  Are we getting close?  I don't know.

            Have you noticed that when someone in the media or political circles that criticizes Putin dies in Russia, the media is all over it saying that Putin is a murderer, but despite the large number of dead in the US who criticized liberals, nothing is said.

             It's true. Even when a deranged shell of a wombat loses a presidential election, they come up with a rationale to deflect the real reason. But when critic after critic drop dead, crickets.
