<p>&quot;Rumors are flying in Washington. Were White House staff involved with prostitutes in Colombia? In advance of the long awaited Department of Homeland Security (DHS)’s Inspector General (IG)’s report on the Columbia prostitution scandal, many in DC are wondering if the Inspector General’s report might answer this question.  
</p>
<p>Fox News\' Jana Winter reported that a high-ranking Secret Service agent told Fox “we knew very early on that White House staff were involved.” Senator Grassley (R-Iowa) asked the same question in April. Apparently, the White House refused to answer Senator Grassley’s concerns.&quot;</p>

<p>Came across the author while going through this website that seems to have some credible information:</p>
