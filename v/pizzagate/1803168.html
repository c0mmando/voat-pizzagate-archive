<p>From YouTube: <strong>Conspiracy of Silence</strong> is a documentary which was originally listed for viewing in TV Guide Magazine, and was to be aired on the Discovery Channel on May 3, 1994. This documentary exposed a network of religious leaders and Washington politicians who flew children to Washington D.C. for sex orgies. Many children suffered the indignity of wearing nothing but their underwear and a number displayed on a piece of cardboard hanging from their necks when being auctioned off to foreigners in Las Vegas, Nevada and Toronto, Canada. At the last minute before airing, unknown congressmen threatened the TV Cable industry with restrictive legislation if this documentary was aired. Almost immediately, the rights to the documentary were purchased by unknown persons who had ordered all copies destroyed.

             not a hoax, but some of the victims were tried for telling the truth and sent to prison for having the audacity to out their attackers. Hard to believe but it's in the documentary, the finest "Just-Us" system money can buy...

            .
           </p>
           <p>
            I thought it would be interesting to perform a surgical dissection of V____Z’s latest offering strictly in context of one Alex Jones.
           </p>
           <p>
            It’s no secret that the bedrock of V____Z’s activity at Voat has been to destroy Alex Jones by claiming he’s CIA pedo cover-upperer (to borrow Brietbart's nomenclature) and his invective laden blindsides against Jones wind their way through a moiety of his comments.
           </p>
           <p>
            Here, V____Z inadvertently provides a textbook example of how to prove Jones is not CIA pedo cover-upperer. The hypothesis is that V____Z appreciates Jon Rappoport and Doug Hagmann enough to create a stand alone voat/pizzagate thread about their discussions of pizzagate. And the briefest of research will show Former State Senator John De Camp and former FBI agent Ted Gunderson to be absolutely vital to the Franklin Coverup. Both men were brave beyond compare and did everything possible to investigate the most grievous crimes known to man.
           </p>
           <p>
            There are seven major elements to consider in V____Z’s submission. They are Jon Rappoport, Doug Hagmann, John De Camp, Ted Gunderson, The Franklin Coverup, the movie Conspiracy of Silence about same, and the very real effort to keep this movie from ever being seen.
           </p>
           <p>
            I submit to the reader that if we can find Alex Jones working in even the very smallest way against any one or more of these seven elements, we can infer Jones
            <em>
             may
            </em>
            be CIA pedo cover-upperer.
           </p>
           <p>
            It is easily verifiable that Jon Rappoport is one of Infowars most frequent guests and a regular contributor of articles.
           </p>
           <p>
            It is easily verifiable that Doug Hagmann is also a frequent guest on Infowars.
           </p>
           <p>
            It is easily verifiable that John De Camp was a guest on Infowars multiple times. The author of this post also submits personal testimony of having heard Alex Jones invoke the name of John De Camp positively scores of times over the years.
           </p>
           <p>
            It is easily verifiable that Ted Gunderson (RIP) was a guest on Infowars multiple times. The author of this post also submits personal testimony of having heard Alex Jones invoke the name of Ted Gunderson positively scores of times over the years.
           </p>
           <p>
            The author of this post submits personal testimony of having heard Alex Jones reference the Franklin Coverup on the order of hundreds of times over the years.
           </p>
           <p>
            Alex Jones used the Infowars platform as a means of distributing the movie Conspiracy of Silence, all copies of which were ordered destroyed save for one copy anonymously secreted to John De Camp.
            <a href="https://www.infowars.com/conspiracy-of-silence-the-franklin-cover-up/">
             Infowars: Conspiracy of Silence
            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            .
           </p>
           <p>
            Conclusion: Alex Jones has pursued the very same agenda pursued by the legendary John De Camp and Ted Gunderson, which is to stop grievous crimes against children.
           </p>
           <p>
            If there could exist a more devastating proof in one Voat submission that Jones is not CIA pedo cover-upperer as furnished by someone entirely dedicated to proving that he is, I can't even remotely imagine what it would look like.
           </p>
           <p>

            Carroll Quigley said that the only time revolution was successful was when the people possessed the same (equal) weaponry as the government. Well ... touche, the people now have the same weaponry as the elite when it comes to communication and information, including rogue hacker whistleblowers, which, incidentally, is a story (rogue whistleblowers) running on Drudge right now. That is why so many heretofore concealed truths are now coming to light.

            Here's some food for thought  (think McMartin case) -   your young child comes home from pre-school with broken hymen and STDs and the kid is barely 5 yrs old. Investigation happens, no one goes to jail. Hundreds of similar cases, no one goes to jail. The evidence clearly shows ritual abuse, a full blown investigation happens, no one goes to jail. Your only child is forever altered, your family barely survives (if it does at all), no one goes to jail.
           </p>

            Well guess what - thats when a parent needs to man the fck up and deliver justice. You devote your entire life, by all means necessary to plan your response and serve cold hard brutal justice on those that everyone knows was guilty. May take years, but you take out the pedo carers, the pedo owner, the pedo cops. No one will ever know. You plan it so well, they'll never know. That's what you do when your reason for living (child) has been raped and theit life destroyed by sick fcks. You kill and you keep killing until ALL of the guilty demons are gone. Simple!
           </p>
           <p>
            PS, given the above,  I still cannot understand how the fck a demonic shitstain like Michael Aquino is still around. Have ALL parents become so fcking cowardly?

             I remember a movie like this.  I think it was Bronson. Wife and daughter raped and killed and guy plead down. Bronson plans for years to take guy out. I think he bought a warehouse and had it for years to take the guy to for torture when he was released from of prison. Bronson was a bad ass. Totally understand this concept.

             Jury nullification.
It's obvious the police and Just-Us system is corrupted. Any parent who removes a pedo from the planet should be found not guilty. Same thing with marijuana convictions.  Alcohol prohibition ended because juries would no longer convict people who were arrested for drinking alcohol.
            </p>
            <p>
             Why is jury nullification not taught to people? Why don't we have anymore civics classes in school? This is why. We are brainwashed into thinking we have to beg pedo politicians and pedo judges to change laws. We as citizens can ignore unjust laws.
            </p>
            <p>
             Also we need an "anti Masonic" political party. After a series of high profile Masonic murders in 1800 NY I believe. The people started anti Masonic parties. These people are beholden to their brothers, not the citizens or or laws i.e. Jack the Ripper.

             YES, exactly what I was thinking. Same parents also allow their kids to be taught complete crap in schools, demand safe spaces and think it's ok to pump their kids w/hormones bcuz of gender identity issues. Not only are the kids brainwashed but so are the parents.

             If that sexual abuse ever happened to my kid, there would be a lot less Pedos living in this world

             That has become abundantly clear.  There was a lot of fear surrounding Jeff Sessions' appointment but that appears to have been redundant in hindsight.  All he has done is fuel rumors that he might be an anti-weed, big tobacco shill.

              See Drudge headline, Sessions is getting MS-13 gang designated as a "terrorist organization," this would fly directly in the face of the CIA who created them, not an ignoble feat. I wouldn't give up, it takes time.

            Around 1:40, the elder Hagmann asks Jon Rappaport about Pizzgate. Why haven't there been high level arrests? Will there be? Jon brings up the Franklin Case, saying that when you get too close to the top, you hit a wall. Your investigation will be stopped. But, he said with the Internet and all these citizen investigators and commentators, all bets are off. In the past these things could be shut down. Now, he thinks there is a possibility  we may see some action.

             <strong>
              Conspiracy of Silence
             </strong>
             is a documentary which was originally listed for viewing in TV Guide Magazine, and was to be aired on the Discovery Channel on May 3, 1994. This documentary exposed a network of religious leaders and Washington politicians who flew children to Washington D.C. for sex orgies. Many children suffered the indignity of wearing nothing but their underwear and a number displayed on a piece of cardboard hanging from their necks when being auctioned off to foreigners in Las Vegas, Nevada and Toronto, Canada. At the last minute before airing, unknown congressmen threatened the TV Cable industry with restrictive legislation if this documentary was aired. Almost immediately, the rights to the documentary were purchased by unknown persons who had ordered all copies destroyed. A copy of this videotape was furnished anonymously to former Nebraska state senator and attorney John De Camp who made it available to retired FBI Agent Ted L. Gunderson. While the video quality is not top grade, this tape is a blockbuster in what is revealed by the participants involved.

            Not sure what is in your post, I know you and I have discussed the mobile site.   Regardless this post is literally slid completely to the left making it impossible to read any of your info or comments.  Just thought it was odd because, well you always put up good shit.  None of the others I've read have this happen so I believe it's ONLY this post.  Pulled it up in chrome and yohnex and same both browsers.

              I came across that also, it's not your links or theirs either.  The links themselves I expect are fine.  You just can't seen anything until you reach the comment section.   It looks like you posted a mountain of info that cannot be seen.  The post link works fine but your research and info before the comments is (and not all others but some) impossible to see at all.  The whole thing has been moved left of view and the screen can not be oriented to see the info.  Maybe it's a shit update but it seems odd.

            Re-reading your thread a little closer made me wonder. Of course I knew De Camp and Gunderson were favorite guests of Jones, but what about the movie that was never distributed? Well, in fact it was distributed, on INFOWARS.

            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            Now why would CIA agent Jones distribute this video?

            I'm afraid you'll have to delete this thread. You see Jon Rappoport is one of Alex Jones's most frequent guests. So is Hagmann for that matter. I wonder why Rappoport and Hagmann would stick with Jones through thick and thin? By the way, I'm going to upvote your thread because I think Rappoport is a terrific observer of the state of things and a great writer for Infowars, which publishes a plethora of his articles.
