<p>The next four links seem odd to place in this thread at first, but they are relevant to the second hole I believe is in the official story: relating to the progression of decay in regards to a human corpse.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.timeanddate.com/weather/">https://www.timeanddate.com/weather/</a>@5333913/climate Did some digging regarding Canoga Park\'s climate history. Average july temperature is 82* F, 65% humidity.</p>
<p><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/1988">https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/1988</a>–89_North_American_drought 1988 was one of the worst droughts/heatwaves in recent American history. It started in California.</p>

This assumes normal weather conditions. Faster in hot and humid conditions. Given the massive heat wave (one of the worst in American history), I believe the rate of decay for the bodies would have been SIGNIFICANTLY faster. Once again, how the hell did no one notice the scent of a rotting corpse?</p>
<p><a href="http://www.fivedoves.com/letters/july2012/pattic727.htm">http://www.fivedoves.com/letters/july2012/pattic727.htm</a> Information about Grand Climax. The target of sacrifices on this day are typically female.</p>
<p><a href="https://forum.davidicke.com/showthread.php?t=259982">https://forum.davidicke.com/showthread.php?t=259982</a> The movie &quot;The Dead Pool&quot; (NOT related to the super hero) may have cryptically foreshadowed Judith Barsi\'s murder 12 days before it happened. Dead Pool is an MK Ultra phrasing. Given how &quot;they&quot; like to telegraph their actions in advance, I have reason to believe this theory is plausible. </p>
<p>Renegade Anon\'s insight into Hollywood gives us information on the MO of Hollywood\'s sacrifices. Their MO is not the sterotypical &quot;men in black/red cloaks&quot;. They run like a Mafia, killing their victims in ways that  are disguised as accidents, illness, suicides, or murder suicides. This would explain the details of the murder.</p>
<p>With all this, I believe I can establish a timeline for the crimes in question for the sake of an updated working theory.</p>
<p>Working Theory:</p>
<p>-1st incident: Twilight Zone (TV Series)
Suspects: Steven Spielberg. Judith\'s mother (accomplice).
Witness: Clare Torao</p>
<p>-2nd Incident:
Suspects: Steven Spielberg, Michael Caine, Joseph Sargent, Judith\'s mother (accomplice).
Witness: Lorraine Gary</p>
<p>-The Murder (my theory has changed here):
Suspects: &quot;Jack the Ripper&quot;. Jozseph Barsi was an abusive scumbag who deserves to burn in hell, but he was not the killer. He was however, the perfect patsy for the crime. &quot;The most effective lies are based off a truth.&quot; The perfect patsy is someone that is already suspect and who\'s character one would expect to pull off the crime. CIA Death Squads and Jack the Ripper groups are required to be agile and discreet, so I suspect between 3 and 4 assailants.</p>
<p>Accomplices: LA PD, the media. The circumstances of this death (psychopath killers, murder suicide patsy, cooperative police/media/coroner match a &quot;Jack the Ripper&quot; killing.</p>
<p>Timeline of the murder: The most likely time of the murder was sometime between 12 AM-4 AM, 7/27/1988 (which would match &quot;Grand Climax). The killers broke into the house in 7/25. Since a sacrifice is likely, I believe the family was drugged/sedated for much of 7/26. Possibly for preparations. The culprits killed them via gun shot on 7/27 as per a hollywood hit, ie head shot as part of the &quot;murder suicide&quot; angle that would be sold to the public. The bodies were stacked like a pyre, and according to Metal Den, Judith\'s was on top (which would make the &quot;murder suicide angle&quot; IMPOSSIBLE). The culprits doused gasoline onto the bodies, lighting them on fire, also part of the narrative. This level of sadism in handeling the bodies is the tip off that the killer is some form of psychopath/sociopath. </p>
<p>Since we know the fire happend on 8:30 AM, this means that its likely that a set up was done. Possibly something like a &quot;Ryuguu Gas Bomb&quot;. What this basically is is that it\'s an incendiary bomb involving gasoline and the fumes. The ignition source can be programed to go off at a specific time. Something as simple as an egg timer can be wired to be such. Of course in such a scenario, one is relying on the fire to destroy the evidence, which includes the set up.</p>
<p>Note that an autopsy report was never given for Jozesph Barsi. Given the progress rate of decomposistion assuming a hot summer (ie July), the police\'s claim of a possible murder of 7/25-7/26 is a lie, for the smell would have been obvious at this point.
*Murder Weapons: Pistol/Revolver, gasoline.</p>',

           The movie "The Dead Pool" (NOT related to the super hero) may have cryptically foreshadowed Judith Barsi's murder 12 days before it happened. Dead Pool is an MK Ultra phrasing. Given how "they" like to telegraph their actions in advance, I have reason to believe this theory is plausible.
          </p>
          <p>
           Renegade Anon's insight into Hollywood gives us information on the MO of Hollywood's sacrifices. Their MO is not the sterotypical "men in black/red cloaks". They run like a Mafia, killing their victims in ways that  are disguised as accidents, illness, suicides, or murder suicides. This would explain the details of the murder.
          </p>
          <p>
           With all this, I believe I can establish a timeline for the crimes in question for the sake of an updated working theory.
          </p>
          <p>
           Working Theory:
          </p>
          <p>
           -1st incident: Twilight Zone (TV Series)
Suspects: Steven Spielberg. Judith's mother (accomplice).
Witness: Clare Torao
          </p>
          <p>
           -2nd Incident:
Suspects: Steven Spielberg, Michael Caine, Joseph Sargent, Judith's mother (accomplice).
Witness: Lorraine Gary
          </p>
          <p>
           -The Murder (my theory has changed here):
Suspects: "Jack the Ripper". Jozseph Barsi was an abusive scumbag who deserves to burn in hell, but he was not the killer. He was however, the perfect patsy for the crime. "The most effective lies are based off a truth." The perfect patsy is someone that is already suspect and who's character one would expect to pull off the crime. CIA Death Squads and Jack the Ripper groups are required to be agile and discreet, so I suspect between 3 and 4 assailants.
          </p>
          <p>
           Accomplices: LA PD, the media. The circumstances of this death (psychopath killers, murder suicide patsy, cooperative police/media/coroner match a "Jack the Ripper" killing.
          </p>
          <p>
           Timeline of the murder: The most likely time of the murder was sometime between 12 AM-4 AM, 7/27/1988 (which would match "Grand Climax). The killers broke into the house in 7/25. Since a sacrifice is likely, I believe the family was drugged/sedated for much of 7/26. Possibly for preparations.

           Since we know the fire happend on 8:30 AM, this means that its likely that a set up was done. Possibly something like a "Ryuguu Gas Bomb". What this basically is is that it's an incendiary bomb involving gasoline and the fumes. The ignition source can be programed to go off at a specific time. Something as simple as an egg timer can be wired to be such. Of course in such a scenario, one is relying on the fire to destroy the evidence, which includes the set up.

           Note that an autopsy report was never given for Jozesph Barsi. Given the progress rate of decomposistion assuming a hot summer (ie July), the police's claim of a possible murder of 7/25-7/26 is a lie, for the smell would have been obvious at this point.
*Murder Weapons: Pistol/Revolver, gasoline.

            Kandy Stern, aka Lauren Berley. Notice title change from "Shoot My Head" to "Shoot My Mind." Also very curious is that she "was created", not born, in 1969.

            Kandy/Lauren was "transplanted at age seven". No mention of parents.
She got word of the attacks of 9/11, and flew to New York to begin filming PSA at ground zero, the protégé of restauranteur and real estate developer CEO: Antonio “Nino” Vendome, of Nino's restaurant.

            Thank You. Again, it is painful to read, but so necessary.  The satanic holiday played into the time of the crime and we now have the same horrid reminder again this year.   This is proof that they do indeed take part in their sacrificing of children and especially on that date.  What horrible narcissistic acts and the most devilish. D- Evil lives in their hearts.  As Always RIP Judith and RIP Heather
