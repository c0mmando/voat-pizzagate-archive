            Dude, you're a finicky picky nazimod! An investigation is a puzzle! If we already knew how all the pieces fit together, we wouldn't be investigating! You're projecting your need to control your surroundings into censoring other people's contributions. Just let it roll, and go busy yourself with something else.

            I watched the video. The first half is mostly factual, but it is important to keep in mind that Satanists have little or no incentive to be totally  honest. When Anton LaVey started the Church of Satan, he disregarded most of what had come before him and threw some bits of atheistic philosophy from various sources together to create something that suited him and called it Satanism. It doesn't make much sense for his followers to pretend that they have a monopoly on Satanism, or that their form of Satanism is the true form. Anton LaVey lied constantly, even by his own admission. He was also a hypocrite - he was not kind to animals.

            It is hard to tell if the person who made this video is a bit naive and inexperienced, or is knowingly and dishonestly trying to whitewash the most sinister forms of Satanism. There really are Satanists who torture and murder people, and sacrifice living creatures to Satan or other demonic entities. When you hear someone saying something like, "A real Satanist would never hurt anyone", it is a lie.

             I don't think he's either naive or inexperienced. Look at his channel.

            Guy, next time put the camera up a bit higher so it doesn't look like you're trying do the Hollywood eye of Horus bit. Or get a hairclip.

           <p>
            For someone who spends a bit of time bagging Christians about their ignorance he's pretty ignorant of what the Bible actaully says about Satan. The classic study is the book of Job, but there are also other references that make it clear that Satan is a title which designates an adversary, i.e. Satan is not a proper name. There is actually justification for Satan's actions in the book of Job, to equate Satan with the devil in this context would be a mistake, as would be calling him a cosmic idiot.
