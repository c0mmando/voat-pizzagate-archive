<p>Checking a few December 2001 flights again, and now things are getting a bit interesting, as there are two separate pages on the pilot log for the flight numbers 33-39. These pilot logs were originally hand written, and another underground journalist has made a huge job turning all almost 1200 flights to CSV data. His work might include mistakes, but the original hand written logs are sent as evidence to The Court and could be checked again. From the CSV data:</p>

<p>My interpretation: Epstein\'s airplane has not visited other places between these flight (flight numbers are in order). Alan Dershowitz, who told the court in a written declaration that he has visited Epstein\'s place in Virgin Island only ONCE and only with his FAMILY, might have <strong>landed to Palm Beach on Dec 8th, continued to Virgin Islands on December 9th, leaving on December 13th</strong>.</p>
<p>The log having double pages with different passenger data for the same flight numbers suggests that someone is not honest here. Hmm... would actually be an easy fix to change a &quot;D&quot; to a &quot;P&quot; in hand written logs. Let\'s remember that it was Mr. Dershowitz himself who delivered the logs to the police.</p>
<p>Additionally, there are A LOT OF FLIGHTS with &quot;AP&quot; as passenger, and none with both AP and AD. Now who might AP be if not Mr. Dershowitz?</p>

           The log having double pages with different passenger data for the same flight numbers suggests that someone is not honest here. Hmm... would actually be an easy fix to change a "D" to a "P" in hand written logs. Let's remember that it was Mr. Dershowitz himself who delivered the logs to the police.
          </p>
          <p>
           Additionally, there are A LOT OF FLIGHTS with "AP" as passenger, and none with both AP and AD. Now who might AP be if not Mr. Dershowitz?

            You could be right, but I don't know... I have looked at those flight logs so many times. I'm still not sure who AP is but I don't think it's Dershowitz. I don't think it's Pintoeither.  I think that AP may be be famous chef Adam Perry Lang who traveled with him as a personal chef around that time. I don't know.
This case drives me crazy.... i don't think there could be any more evidence against Epstein that could take him down. He's the worst or the worst and a free man. Florida police found all the evidence they needed to prosecute and then the FBI took the case, made a plea, and covered all this bullshit up.

             Adam Perry Lang is my conclusion too after looking into this. The flight logs seems manipulated and incomplete, so there's still something to look forward in this.

            I watched the video too, seems that one of the child actresses is Tiffany. The ending shows it was made for some passed away man, nothing on him I found. Seems like a difficult lead to follow in overall, maybe just stop following that one and find something more solid.

            Using bth passengers names on image search has a lot of shitty content, including malware/phishing sites, lesbian poetry in spanish, model agency (children too). You might be onto something. Safe to click this far:

             A huge THANKS! Please vote this up ppl. The pages in question are 70 and 71, and definitely the D is NOT changed to P in the handwritten docs, but more likely misinterpetended other way around by the one turning the data to CSV. So... A new theory needed. Few notices:
            </p>
            <ul>
             <li>
              Page 70 seems like an original, and there's something odd on 71 starting from Nov 4th then jumping to Nov 30th (there are flights between Nov 4th and Nov 30th in the previous page). For me it seems like page 71 is originally started for another airplane looking at the model numbers, then filled with double data of  70 since then.
             </li>
             <li>
              The continuation between pages 70 and 71 is visible in the total and forwarded amounts
             </li>
             <li>
              Page 70 seems to have a wrong amount of landings in total
             </li>
             <li>
              The odd overwriting "ON NEXT" found on page 70
             </li>
             <li>
              The page 72 is NOT continuation of 71 nor 70. Why the order of the pages is mixed this way?
             </li>
             <li>
              However mixed, "AD" or "Dershowitz" are not visible in either of the pages, so looking for another line on he joining flight to Virgin Islands

            A personal database record of flight records is not proof of flights, it is a
            <em>
             statement
            </em>
            . Proof of flights comes from an air traffic controller. If that is supposed to be some kind of alibi then he's clearly got something to hide.

             In a private plane, is there any other control but the pilot's log on passengers? There are no tickets bought, and with Epstein's wealth I'd guess there's no check-in for his flight guests.

              Fair point. Okay, so if somebody flies to the US Virgin Islands (so they're not leaving the USA at any point), do they need a current passport? I mean, here in England I can technically leave the country into Europe without one (at least now, this might change after Brexit fully takes effect) - I might not get very far without one (that is, if I cannot sufficiently prove my identity), but legally I don't actually need one. So what about the USA (excuse my ignorance, I really haven't got a clue about this)?

               If you're flying within the US you at least need a photo ID (license). At least that's how it is at a regular airport.

                So presumably, if somebody flies privately and domestically then the passengers don't need to be declared. In other words, a private passenger roster means virtually jack shit.

                  is a Boeing 727. I wonder how many private and civil aerodromes in the US would be able to accommodate such an aircraft? In other words, what are the chances that when this thing is at an airport the passengers are at some point required to show ID?

                   As far as I know there is actually a separate part of the airport where private planes are parked/stored. Not sure if you need to show ID to get in there, or maybe just the pilot does.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   I just looked it up. It is not always necessary to show ID on a private chartered flight. I assume it is the same if you own the plane.

                    Bear in mind though that if the flight leaves US airspace then customs and immigration will be relevant - without the usual checks, terrorism and smuggling will be a problem.
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    In any case, as I said a private passenger roster is worth very little if nobody has to present before an airport official at any time. All we really know for sure is who the plane belongs to (presumably who the pilot is as well, but again there's no guarantee unless somebody actually IDs him). Useful by all means, but if somebody wanted to use that for an alibi then it might not be much good.

            </p>
            <p>
             Here's another one, though I'm not familiar with this dude. From Reddit, 4 months ago: "AP (Possibly
             <strong>
              Albert Pinto
             </strong>
             )"
            </p>
            <p>
             Wow. Anthony Podesta... you could be onto something Moloch. Always a fan of your contributions.

             Did they know well enough as "AP" has been on the passenger list 94 times? (without another "xP" on the same flight).
            </p>
            <p>
             Alan Dershowitz must have made a lot of flight with Epstein, being his lawyer, but there's only 6 lines with his name and 5 with his initials between 1998-2005

              make that known to the prosecutors handling the other two cases currently ongoing

             <li>
              support other victims of Epstein/Dershowitz to come up with their claims
             </li>
             <li>
              Connecting the dots between other names on the passenger lists, maybe one of them is ready to tell being on the same flight with Dershowitz
             </li>
             <li>
              Find out who else the "AP" might be

            I've been thinking if it would be more useful or more bad to filter and share a full list of names of all the passangers. Difficult to say. If people here could take them just as "passengers" before anything pedo-related would be actually found on them... But there are those trolls who would just pick a clean name and accuse him/her on pedophilia, making the whole list controversial pretty fast. If there's a name you want me to check if he/she has been on the passenger list, I'm happy to do that. Fair questions in comments, not as PM would probably be a nice way to handle these names. Having like Prince Albert, president Clinton, lot of celebrities and all makes things a bit difficult.

            In this case, Hershowitz was a defendant and delivered the logs as attachment to support his declaration. Legally speaking that was a nice way to make it himself instead of having the police to ask them from the pilot. He's a talented lawyer, and pretty fuck'n difficult to get caught on possible errors in the logs now that the case ended to an unbeliaevable sweethart deal. Part of the story:
           </p>
           <ul>
            <li>
             In the original claim both Epstein and Dershowitz were accused of child rape
            </li>
            <li>
             Dershowitz got out of the accusations, him included to the sweetheart deal in the end, and with his written declaration and the flight logs delivered
            </li>
            <li>
             Epstein, accused by 40 girsl all minors when the crime happened, got his attorneys, NYPD and FBI in cooperation for a deal. He didn't avoid pleading guilty, but...
            </li>
            <li>
             He got 18 months "in jail", out of which he was there for 13 months, out of which he had an opportunity to be out of jail for 16h/day to handle his business... So in practice,
             <strong>
              he just visited the jail to sleep for a while.
             </strong>
            </li>
            <li>
             Deal included a protection on future accusations, but the process how this deal was made is currently under another court hearing. The latest question on that hearing, as I recall, is if the personal emails between Epstein's lawyers and governmental officers related to the process could be used as evidence. Epstei'n lawyers are claiming they are under a client protection and should not be delivered, the other side claims there can't be a client-relationship between the attorney and FBI. Case worth following!
            </li>
            <li>
             If the process is found illegal, the girls abused are able to make another case
            </li>
            <li>
             Outside this case, there are other girls accusing Epstein and another court hearing going on. These girls can accuse him, as the earlier deal can't cover the victims who were not informed during the earlier deal. Additionally, it's claimed that even those girls were not fully informed
            </li>
           </ul>
           <p>
            Conclusion: A superrich pedo is seemingly playing with the court, in the meanwhile maybe having just more girls abused, flying with his private plane spending there 600h/year doing "business" and getting "massages".

             He was a part of OJ's famous Dream Team wasn't he? I know I should google it, but I remember the name from way back for some reason. I've seen and heard of him outside Epstein, so he must be quite the attorney. And he's special....so he probably gets rewarded for it kindly.

              Great if it's useful, feel free to ask for info on any other flights. I have all those almost 1200 between 1998-2005. Questions on persons somehow related to pedogate otherwise, using the flight logs as further info, would probably be useful regarding our investigations. Oh and yes, he was.

               I see Naomi Campbell right away, word is she's a madam/handler. Big league, like managing the "stars" or the models, there's something going on, on the side there. I always think, where there's models, there's a possibility. Instagram ruined my perception of models, and that's another place they sell themselves, they advertise with imagery and symbols.

               Not related, least yet. But after Snoop Dog pulled his dumb ass stunt in that vid last week, bow wow..the nephew threatened to "pimp Melania out" I think he outed a business going on there on the West Coast. From what I remember hanging out with the gang sort (this was HS, he had a girlfriend that I was friends with, it got me through a bad public school system alive) the gangs turn out women just as much as they sell drugs. My friend told these guys I was off limits, I was a friend, not a hoe. But, like me, a lot of these girls come from poor homes. Dad is gone, mom is at work and you have jack shit to do. In the hood, they make money BAMN (By any means necessary). I'm wondering about Calvin Broadus now (I think that's Snoop's name) I'm actually shocked Bow Wow wasn't visited by Feds for his threat. He's not doing anything worthwhile, Bow Wow is probably a damn pimp. I hate them now for threatening Melania like that.

            There is a blatant pizza-ping pong scene in the movie "Reversal of Fortune," based upon Derschowitz's book.
