<p>When Allison Mack was released from prison late April on a $5 million bond, she filed an application for an Order of Excludable Delay and entered a plea deal.  The new trial date is October 2.  Mack informed the court that there was &quot;reasonable likelihood&quot; that negotiations &quot;will  result in a disposition of this case without trial.&quot;  This Application was filed shortly after she entered a plea of not-guilty to the 3 charges she is facing in the case.</p>
<p>The Raniere/Mack Complaint lists 2 former NXIVM members, women known as Jane Doe 1 and Jane Doe 2.  A woman by the name of CC-1, who was revealed to be Allison Mack in subsequent filings, was Raniere\'s first slave and provided collateral which guaranteed she would remain faithful to him by providing Raniere with damning material.</p>
<p>CC-1\'s email was titled &quot;vow 3&quot; and included an attached letter.  The letter pledged CC-1\'s &quot;full and complete life&quot; to Raniere.  In the letter, CC-1 used the terms &quot;slave&quot; and &quot;master&quot; to refer to herself and Raniere.  Moreover, the letter identified &quot;collateral&quot; to &quot;cement&quot; the vow made by CC-1.</p>
<p>The collateral was described as:</p>
<p>● a letter regarding CC-1\'s mother and father that would &quot;destroy their character.&quot;</p>
<p>● a contract that transferred custody of any children birthed by CC-1 to Raniere if CC-1 broke her commitment to him</p>
<p>● a contract that transferred ownership of CC-1\'s home if the commitment to Raniere was broken</p>
<p>● a letter addressed to social services alleging abuse to CC-1\'s nephews</p>
<p>It is not clear if any of the claims made in those letters are true.</p>
<p>Soon, CC-1 was recruiting slaves of her own and filling out the pyramid that Raniere had hoped to create, selecting Jane Doe 1 as one of these wonen.</p>
<p>&quot;The defendant has a decades\' long history ofabusing wonen and girls.  According to cofidential sources, the defendant had repeated sexual encounters with multiple teenage girls in the mid-to-late 1980\'s and early 1990\'s.  In one instance, the defendant met a 15-year old girl while he was in his 20\'s and had repeated sexual contact with her.  In another instance, the defendant met a 12-year old girl whose mother (likely Nancy Salzman) worked for the defendant snd began tutoring her.  Shortly thereafter, the defendant began having regular sexual intercourse with her, including at his home where he lived with multiple adult sexual partners.&quot;</p>
<p>Jane Doe 1 stated that her first meeting with Raniere ended with the leader questioning her devotion but soon, things took a bizarre turn.</p>
<p>The next night, CC-1received a text message from Raniere.  She woke Jane Doe 1 in the middle of the night and assigned her to meet Raniere and tell him she would do anything he asked her to do.  Jane Doe 1 did as she was assigned, and Raniere led her to a house across the street.</p>
<p>Raniere directed Jane Doe 1 to remove her clothes and msde comments about her naked body.  Raniere then blindfolded her, led her into a car and drove her around in a manner that Jane Doe 1 believed he was trying to prevent her from knowing where they were going.</p>
<p>Raniere led Jane Doe 1, still blindfolded, through some trees into what she believed was a shack and tied her to a table.  Another person in the room who Jane Doe 1 did not previously know was present, began performing oral sex on her as Raniere circled the table making comnents.</p>
<p>Jane Doe 1 did not want to participate in this sexual activity but believed it was part of her commitment and that if she broke it, her collateral would be rekeased.</p>
<p>Jane Doe 1 said she then began yo frequently have sex with Raniere while also frequently posing nude for CC-1 who on occasion, sent close-up pictures of her vagina to Raniere.

<p>Allegations of Raniere\'s illegal sexual predilictions are also ouylined in a letter sent by US Attorney Richard P. Donoghue to Judge Steven M. Gold back in March.  
</p>
<p>Jane Doe 1 testified in front of the grand jury stating that Allison Mack &quot;did knowingly and intentionally conspire to provide and obtain the labor and services of a person...by means of serious harms and threats.&quot;</p>
<p>Additionally, Raniere and Mack could be facing human trafficking charges, court documents suggest.</p>
<p>A new filing discussing sensitive evidence from alleged victims mentions &quot;human smuggling, alien laboring, physical or mental abuse towards an intimate partner, stalking, sexual abuse, ir sex trafficking.&quot;</p>
<p>The lawyer for Raniere suggested that the defense will argue that the sexual acts between Raniere and his younger fema look e accusers were consensual.</p>
<p>&quot;He believes his innocence, and I\'m impressed with his stamins.  He has no reason to plead guilty,&quot; said Raniere\'s attorney, Marc Agnifilo.  Agnifilo then questioned why the branding of young women was a crime, stating: &quot;There are groups of men who brand themselves.  When women choose to brand themselves they become victims?&quot;</p>
<p>Agnifilo closed out his remarks by lashing out at those who are labeling NXIVM as a sex cult.  &quot;It\'s a slogan, it\'s a label that the government is attacking to conduct to make it nefarious.  Women joined of their own volition.&quot;</p>
<p>The prosecution also had news to share on May 4, revealing thst more indictments would be coming in the case.

            The articles about the 12 and 15 year olds are referring to activity in 80s and 90s. I don't see how you get "strong possibility" out of that.

             I am not so sure about that.  The links I provided do not say who was recruited when but do provide the possibility that CC-1 was Mack and Jane Doe 1 and 2 were females, one of whom may have been Nancy Salzman's daughter.  I believe Frank Parlato.  It is reported that Allison Mack joined NXIVM in 2010.
These 2 Jane Doe's' could have been 12 and 15 then.  Why does the Complaint mention age 20?  I have no idea.  Maybe plaintiffs 'attorney screwed-up and that is why future indictments may be filed.  Maybe I'm wrong.

            . If the victims in the indictment were underage I'm wondering why it was not expressly stated.  There is also the possibility he groomed minors in anticipation of sexual  acts which they could consent to once crossing the threshold to legal adulthood.   There remains a great deal of investigation to do to prepare for trial.  We won't  be privy to alot of the details until then. A prosecutor would take his strongest  witnesses to jumpstart  such criminal proceedings who are more likely to be adults. To the extent that other similar crimes can be admitted into evidence, it might be useful to have your adult victims describe the incidents of child abuse. Putting underage witneses on the stand is always problematic.  I think that there are sufficient reports outside the initial indictment of underage victims to keep your research on Keith Raniere relevant to Pizzagate.

            Buried in the complaint though, is a statement that Jane Doe 1 was an adult when "recruited":
           </p>

           <p>
           </p>
           <p>
            As for Jane Doe 2, her age is conspicuously absent, however she did own a car.   So, if she was 16 or 17, I think she would legally be considered a minor because there is a crime involved, but I'm not sure how the law works.

             , I missed that.  But it all makes sense.  Maybe that is why the prosecution recently said new indictments were coming?  With the statutes cited in the Complaint, I would think this is a possibility.

             , need your comments.  Also, is there any documentation that reveals how long Mack was involved with NXIVM?  That could also substantiate or refute the ages of Jane Does' 1 and 2.

               That's a really good catch. And interesting theory. It actually seems like it could make a ton of sense. Have you seen Mack's last post on IG/Twitter? It's a little boy reciting some sort of new age mumbo jumbo and the poor thing looks like he's been abused with the circles around his eyes... :(

            Everyone in NXIVM knows India ran The Delegates. The idea was first promulgated by cult member James Del Negro. Raniere took credit for devising it and ordered India to operate it
           </p>
           <p>
            The “Delegates” were in fact gofers. The company was basically a gofer service where NXIVM slaves, illegal immigrants, and teen girls would run errands, clean homes, chauffeur, cook, and provide other services for NXIVM members who came to Albany to learn the secret teachings of Raniere, whose followers are instructed that they should call him Vanguard.
           </p>
           <p>
            I don’t claim India was involved in sex trafficking through The Delegates, but, according to numerous sources, India worked for a time with a group of teen girls from Chihuahua Mexico, who were part of The Delegates.

             I read about the young girls from Chihuahua and the wealthy Rosa Laura Junco, whose father is the most powerful publisher in Mexico. She convinced parents of these girls to join this cult, promising free education and of course, a better life.  So sad.

               In one of the news articles, it came out that the former president of Mexico's son was the head of the Mexican headquarters for NXIVM. Satanic worship all up in the highest government levels all over the world. I'm not surprised. I AM surprised though that the Mexican government cooperated and took part in arresting Raniere, so obviously someone high up was willing to let him get his ass arrested. Or maybe it was because the heat was getting to close to the real puppet masters...
