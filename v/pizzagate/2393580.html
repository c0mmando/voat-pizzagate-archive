            I've been thinking a lot about the CPS / Adoption Agency aspect and it is really bugging me. There needs to be a major investigation by real people, not a bunch of compromised cops / CPS workers in a self serving "give us more funding" manner. When I recently attended sexual abuse prevention training it struck me that the presenter actually used the term "Little Friend" in reference to a girl, without thinking about it. It stuck with me and made me wonder if that was a slip up.
           </p>
           <p>
            I did a paper on removals / termination of parental rights in law school and the professor was a federal judge. He didn't like my paper very much at all actually, but my premise was that the civil termination process gives parents less rights than someone who gets accused of smoking a joint. It shouldn't be that way. Family law is a total joke actually. It makes me sick.

             I see you have legal training.
            </p>
            <p>
             One thing most people don't think about is a little-known concept in both UK law, and US law (which is derived from UK law) called
            </p>
            <p>
             Courts of Equity
            </p>
            <p>
             The concept goes back centuries in England. Courts of equity are allowed to decide matters on the basis of "equity" or what's right, not necessarily what's constitutional, or in accord with common law.
            </p>
            <p>
             Of course what is "equitable" depends on the opinion of the judge hearing the case. And since judges are so often SJWs you get some horrible decisions.
            </p>
            <p>
             Anyways: in a court of equity, rights such as being able to question your accuser, public trial, trial by a jury of your peers, even Habeas Corpus, are disregarded. This is why, for example, a guy whose wife got him jailed on a bogus accusation can go to family court with her lawyer and get custody and restraining orders without the guy even being present to defend himself.
            </p>
            <p>
             This is also why judges can order all kinds of things without the person being able to defend themselves if the judge claims that a decision "is in the best interests of the child" which is a principal of equity that's even been made statutory in many states, and overrides the constitution.
            </p>
            <p>
             Also, in England, judges have gotten away with orders to both parents and the media that they can't even talk to anyone else about whether a child seizure has happened or whether they appeared before the court, let alone what happened in the court.

              Yeah I've studied it a little, it's something I am no expert in as I am not a licensed attorney. I've actually been studying this recently but now I'm not even sure I want to be involved with the legal field any more. So I may never go beyond just a house wife again. The Best Interest of the Child standard in family court is pretty ridiculous - from what I hear, there's no basis for appeal and no way to sue a family attorney for malpractice.

            CPS currently gets sued by victims of a pedophile ring.
           </p>
           <p>
            The most tragic story connected to this is a girl who was first placed as a toddler with the pedophile / trafficker and got pimped out to other pedophiles. Although her biological mother got worried due to her ill health, CPS did nothing.
           </p>
           <p>
            Later, they placed her with a woman
            <em>
             (very graphic/trigger warning)
            </em>
            who put her in a hot bath, so that 80% of her skin got burned and her toes had to be amputated. She is five now and will have to undergo reconstruction operations for the rest of her life.
           </p>
           <p>
            Another child that was put in the care of the pedophile went 10 times to the police in a 12 year period, but they didn't do anything.
           </p>
           <p>
            This ist outrageous. This has to stop.

              Thanks, Carmencita, will take a look at the website. I'm considering doing a research post about CPS cases, the story of the young girl who was placed twice (!) with families who tortured her really turned my stomach. :-(

               Thanks for your great work. Here is one of my thoughts.
              </p>
              <p>
               Since CPS is by far the biggest source of trafficked children in America, researching this and publicizing it, is probably the absolutely most effective think people can do to attack the pedophile networks.
              </p>
              <p>
               The problem is that sheep-like Normies get extreme cognitive dissonance when disturbing shit like this is exposed, and they shut down their brains.
              </p>
              <p>
               Don't know what the answer to that problem.

                I don't know how to solve the cognitive dissonance problem - right now many were quite shocked to learn about the debauchery of Oxfam staff in Haiti and in Chad. And we all know that's just the tip of the iceberg.
               </p>
               <p>
                Imagine all the elderly ladies in Britain who do volunteer work in Oxfam shops or donate money.

                But if this gets out to the masses, that huge $ Amount is being spent to send stolen children to abusive foster parents it could make a difference.  It needs to make the news.

                 Something came to me while I was reading the post on Oxfam by HugoWeaving.
                </p>
                <p>
                 Maybe the way to get this out to the public is by getting the elites to fight among themselves?
                </p>
                <p>
                 The Democrats are throwing Bill Clinton under the bus, because he's become radioactive due to his well known sexual abusing:
                </p>
                <p>
                 <a href="https://www.politico.com/story/2018/02/14/bill-clinton-metoo-backlash-campaign-407280">
                  https://www.politico.com/story/2018/02/14/bill-clinton-metoo-backlash-campaign-407280
                 </a>
                </p>
                <p>
                 So the Clinton/House of Lords camp, both in the US and the UK, are throwing Oxfam under the bus:
                </p>
                <p>
                 <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2018/02/13/europe/oxfam-whistleblower-says-charity-failed-to-at-intl/index.html">
                  https://edition.cnn.com/2018/02/13/europe/oxfam-whistleblower-says-charity-failed-to-at-intl/index.html
                 </a>
                </p>
                <p>
                 These abuses happened eight years ago, but it's only now that media reports are coming out- because the Owners of the MSM didn't want them to come out until now, when they want to distract people from the deeper Clinton/Elite Pedophilia stories.
                </p>
                <p>
                 It's like "abandon ship, every man for himself" and they are turning on each other like cornered rats.
                </p>
                <p>
                 Everybody's trying to get the public to focus on somebody else, and avoid the wrath of the public.
                </p>
                <p>
                 But what this means is,
                 <strong>
                  all
                 </strong>
                 of their shit gets exposed to public view, and people won't be able to bury their heads in the sand like ostriches anymore.
                </p>
                <p>
                 People are already starting to react. A famous British actress has boycotted Oxfam:

                </p>
                <p>
                 and attendance at Woody Allen's film is plummeting, with at least one movie critic publicly saying she won't go to any more of his movies:

                  YES!!  Thy would stab each other in the back in a NiY Minute.  They are all so Evil the would sell their own mother or child for their Satanic Masters.   What can be done on Twitter or FB strategically?  The certainly will and may be Turning.  This Oxfam stuff is only the Tip of the Iceberg.  I hope other Charities get exposed, Unicef, Save the Children, Red Cross, etc.  They used to be Top Drawer, but now they are Bottom of the Barrel.
