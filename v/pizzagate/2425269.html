            When i was a young child, my pediatrician tried to get me to strip for an exam and i refused. So he checked beneath my panties and his fingers touched things they had no real business touching in my opinion. It traumatized me to the point of me point of not allowing any gynecologist access to me to this day. I've been to one gynecologist in my whole life and even though she was a female it was a harrowing experience and i made the decision never to return. People need to be very careful about what they do to kids bodies and how they do it. I'm not saying the doctor was molesting me. I'm just saying whatever he was trying to check for resulted in more harm to my psyche than protection of my body. Thanks for nothing, doctor. P.s. I hope you die in a fire.

            I just read the report again.  This would anger me to the point of marching down to my Rep. or Sen. or both and demanding an answer.  Sit Ins are in Order.  WTH do they think they are doing?  We are giving birth to our children and they have complete control of them?  This is Utterly Disgusting.  Also, this is another way for Big Pharma to fill up their coffers.  It seems every other day we hear about something that allows the govt. to have complete access to our children.  Totally Unacceptable and should  ALARM every parent.

             Totally agree - We need to be on top of all legislation.  I'm a frequent lurker here, and this compelled me to post.  The research on this board is phenomenal - not only critical to protecting children but also because the "politics" of child exploitation extend into every area of our lives.
            </p>
            <p>
             Here's where this is going: "They" will "qualify" the school nurse's room as a clinic.  As Crusader points out below, they'll use it to usher in other "treatments," including HPV vaccinations and who knows what else.  IUDs?  Psychotropic medications?  Hormone injections?  RFIDs?  All without parental knowledge or consent.  People who think this could never happen (I know I'm preaching to the choir here) need to get their heads out of the sand.  It IS happening.  Pay attention to how often you see "stakeholders" mentioned in their narratives (Heck - the above starts out with "Liability for Costs" and ends with the minor getting the bill - think about that...minors aren't legally liable...yet.)   This is all about profit and control.

              Yes. It's ushering in the new world order where we're all like cattle. The Bible foretells this. The mark of the beast is probably going to be an RFID chip implant or something like it. We will not be able to buy or sell without it. I'm not afraid of that, I know God's plan for those that believe in him and we get to very conveniently bypass THAT hell on earth, still I consider it my duty to warm people every chance I have. God and Satan are real, guys. And the pedocracy itself was foretold.

             </p>
             <p>
              "It also forced all people, great and small, rich and poor, free and slave, to receive a mark on their right hands or on their foreheads, 17so that they could not buy or sell unless they had the mark, which is the name of the beast or the number of its name. 18 This calls for wisdom. Let the person who has insight calculate the number of the beast, for it is the number of a man. That number is 666. "

             There is a proposed amendment to this law to allow for the prophylactic treatment (read vaccination) of children without parental inclusion.   Basically, CT bought $9.5 mill of HPV vaccine, and now its on a shelf and they need to make sure it gets used before it expires….

              Possibly the only way to get around this is for a parent, mother of the girl and the father of a boy to accompany their child into the examining room.  This way they will not be able to get away with this egregious invasion of our children's personal privacy.  The surely cannot deny a parent's right to stay with their child.  This of course will be very hard for working parents.

               True, but many parents may be naive and too trusting of doctors.  Just look at the Olympic doctor guy.  He molested girls with the parents sometimes in the same room.  Of course, the fact that he was a prestigious "Olympic" doctor made them trust him in ways that they might not have trusted any other doctor -- but still, unfortunately there are a lot of parents who will trust that a doctor wouldn't do something like that, especially not right in front of them.  Even adult women who have been molested by a doctor sometimes struggle with doubt that maybe they misunderstood what happened.  Sometimes it is hard to wrap your head around the fact that someone actually did brazenly violate you and abuse their position of trust and/or your vulnerable state.

                Oh, yes I know what you mean and that is a problem of not knowing you have the power to speak up to anyone.  Especially to people in power for they use their power to seduce you.  Just like priests become drunk with power when they wear those vestments and believe they can forgive people for their sins.  We have to start teaching our children to question authority.

                  I used to have this problem.  No longer.  I realized this about 20 years ago.  Wish it had come sooner.  Now I just say No.  I can't do that.  You can't do that.  It's all about knowing that they are no better than you are.  If someone tries anything with a child they should immediately yell out NO!  Loudly.  Then DON'T touch me there!  Especially in a Dr.'s Office.  NO is def the first word a child should learn.

                   My mom was in the room. I feel that women are especially gullible when it comes to trusting the white coats. My mom scolded me for saying no to an adult. And many of Larry Nasser's victims were molested with their mothers in the room. What ignorance on the part of those mothers, allowing their daughter's back injuries to be treated via their vaginas. We live in a world where stupidity reigns, carmen. 😔

                    I know and that is something I don't understand either.  I have no answers for other people.  If I had a daughter that would never happen to her.  I have a feeling those mothers may have been the same as those stage mothers.  Wanting their daughters to become big athlete stars.  He was probably the best in his field and it might have been quite a feather in that mother's cap.  I can't see another reason other than complete stupidity.

            This makes me want to throw up.  I would not trust any of these people with a child after the horrid abuse committed by Dr. Nasser.  What is to stop a Dr. in some small clinic from having a camera in the room.  What a great vehicle to generate CP.  Considering that Delaware and Connecticut are Cesspools for Pedophilia, I do not think they have the child's interest or that of the parents at heart.  Too bad we have lost faith in our govt. officials when it comes to protecting our children.

             I remember a case a few years back where a gynecologist filmed the exams he performed on adult women.  And he had a very prestigious position at a university hospital, if I recall correctly.  If someone is doing that with adult women, you can bet that they are doing it with children.  Sometimes I wonder how we have fallen so far as a nation that this is becoming such a widespread problem.  But maybe it has always been this bad and they are just now brazen enough to crawl out from under their rocks and do it more openly -- either way, our society has gotten sicker and will continue to do so until enough people take a stand and declare that we will not tolerate this.

              I have heard of those cases too.  I also think it is good this is coming out.  For one, I believe there are many and the more that people hear, the better.  But many do not check out these stories.  That is the problem.  I have now been passing these on to the next door neighbor.  He has  a young girl and he is thanking me.

            I'm torn on this. Most children aren't going to tell if they're being sexually abused, especially if it's a parent or guardian, so asking for permission to chick for VD wouldn't go over well, and the child is kept in danger. Then, the catch 22 where the Dr.s are paid to reveal info to higher ups who are interested in children who are being abused, and their abusers. Just like in Cathy O'Brien's case where the gov't intercepted her father's bestiality video he was sending through the mail, and the gov't basicly hired him and took control over Cathy.

            We need to keep an eye on this statute and Connecticut in general because we know that it's a hot bed for satanic acivities.

             But are they just going to be doing random checks?  If not, then if they have a reason to be suspicious about possible sexual abuse, don't they already have the right to take the child into protective custody and interview and examine the child to determine if abuse is happening?
            </p>
            <p>
             This law seems (to me anyway) to be more about allowing children 12 and up to be treated as adults when it comes to sexually transmitted diseases.  This allows them to be treated and for the treatment to be kept secret.  This law actually is great for sexual predators (maybe not actual pedophiles since under the age of 12, they do have to report it).  If they are abusing a 13 or 14 year old child and give them a veneral disease, they can now take them to the doctor secretly and have them treated and the physicians -- by law -- cannot tell the parents about it.  Most parents would want to know who the partner was that gave them the disease and now, kids won't be pressured to divulge any information if they are being abused by a teacher or coach or priest, etc.
            </p>
            <p>
             I don't see this as a good thing at all.  Parents have a right and a need to know if their children are sexually active -- especially if they have contracted a veneral disease.  It might be fine to say that a minor can be treated even without parental permission, but I still think that parental notification is warranted.  In the event that a parent is suspected, they should be able to open an investigation into the parent without divulging the STD info until the investigation is complete -- but parents should still be told.  If they are innocent of molestation, they need to know what is going on with their child and if they are guilty, they need to be criminally charged.

              I'm not disagreeing with you. This is a double-edged sword. Like I said, if the parents or guardians are the abusers, they won't give consent anyway.

             I get that.  It just seems that all the laws done "for the benefit of the child" also create the opportunity for a child to be exploited.

              I agree, which is why they purposefully do these catch 22 types of activities. They just hoping people won't keep eagle eyes on them, so we have to remain vigilant.
