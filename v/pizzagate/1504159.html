            Yes, but we can't give up on the children. That's why I'm not going anywhere. We gotta keep fighting for them, right?

            What gets me down also is that some of the mods in here can destroy a post for no other reason than personal bias. For this reason and of course the numerous shills, this place can easily become a double-edge sword, if you ask me.

            I felt pretty strongly that the explanation provided in this research article nailed it. There are no sources, so utilize your discernment. Maybe you will get a takeaway.

             Great article, lots of hints. I think the "Sotheby's card" is another interesting clue to be investigated. I read something about a 'secret circle member card' usually a pass to certain events such as museum and gallery expositions, private dinners, parties and gatherings. The 'card' in question is given to the members to be recognised and picked up by private drivers or transportation companies? I don't recall exactly, I'll have to look for the thread and maybe pick up from there also.

            Thanks. Great thread. I've been reading the comments and it's all very disturbing and... emotionally tiring. I'm trying to distance myself a bit so I can concentrate on the investigative part, but honestly after many hours spent on PG today, I'm wiped... I think I'll catch up tomorrow.

            The Washington Center for Equitable Growth is a new research and grantmaking organization founded to accelerate cutting-edge analysis into whether and how structural changes in the U.S. economy, particularly related to economic inequality, affect growth. Core to our mission is helping to build a stronger bridge between academics and policymakers so that new research is relevant, accessible, and informative to the policymaking process.
           </p>
           <p>
            To these ends, in the fall of 2013 we launched a competitive, peer-reviewed grantmaking program to help establish new lines of inquiry and analysis, bring together diverse types of evidence, and encourage collaboration across academic fields. Our first grants totaling $610,000 were announced in July 2014. During our second round of grantmaking, we awarded 24 additional grants totaling $784,000, with an additional $49,800 in co-funding from the Ewing Marion Kauffman Foundation.
           </p>
           <p>
            In 2016, Equitable Growth awarded 19 grants in this year’s round of grantmaking. Awards totaled $759,135, with an additional $52,500 in co-funding from the Russell Sage Foundation.

            Sandler Foundation was formed in 1991 by Herb Sandler and Marion Sandler.
Here is a one-page summary of our approach, grant categories and some of our grantees.
We have also adopted Values and Guiding Principles for Grants, summarizing our operating philosophy. Herb Sandler discusses the foundation’s approach to philanthropy at Bridgespan.org.
As of December 31, 2015, Sandler Foundation had made charitable grants exceeding $750 million, with the majority of the funds distributed since 2006.

            Susan Sandler spends her time at the Sandler Foundation, which works to strengthen the progressive infrastructure, expose corruption and abuse, advocate for vulnerable and exploited people and environments, and advance scientific research in neglected areas. In addition, Susan is the president of the “Progressive Era Project,” a donor collaborative that builds infrastructure in California to move forward a bold, social justice policy agenda through investing in voter turnout, the candidate pipeline, and other strategies. The bulk of Susan’s work focuses on education policy and building political power in communities of color.

            Sandler is a former banking entrepreneur who, with his wife Marion, built up a California savings and loan called Golden West over the course of forty years, before cashing out in 2006 with $2.4 billion in winnings. They put $1.3 billion into their Sandler Foundation and embarked on a giving spree that shows no signs of letting up (although Marion passed away in 2012.) To date, the Sandler Foundation has given out around $700 million; Herb and his small staff, including his two children, plan to stick with this job until most of that banking fortune is gone.
           </p>
           <p>
            The Sandlers heavily backed UCSF's Program for Breakthrough Biomedical Research (PBBR) 
The Sandlers have had unusual success in finding top leaders to bankroll, including John Podesta, the founding chief of CAP; Paul Steiger, the founding head of ProPublica, and Martin Eakes, who built the Center for Responsible Lending and still leads it.While considering Podesta, they talked to over two dozen people who worked with him in government (where he had been Bill Clinton's chief of staff, among other roles). The reports on Podesta were so positive that Sandler was sure there had to be a catch. "I was prepared to dislike him." Instead, all the rave reviews turned out to be true, and after being convinced to take on the job of building CAP full time, Podesta went on to turn it into a major force in Washington before handing the reins over to Neera Tanden, CAP's current president.

            You left something at the Field house &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Susan &amp; Herb &gt; &gt;
I just came from checking the Field house and I have a square cloth &gt; handkerchief (white w/ black) that was left on the kitchen island. &gt; &gt; Happy to send it via the mail if you let me know where I should send it. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I also meant to inquire yesterday about the pillows you purchased. I can &gt; send them as well, if you let me know where they are in the house. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Safe travels to all &gt; &gt; Kate &gt; &gt; &gt;

              Most of us are not skilled at researching. It doesn't surprise me that anything is left unchecked until one of the more skilled in the investigation takes an interest in it. I would definitely like to see that happen with these connections. The best I could do is pop this stuff into some search engines but that's about the extent of my ability to help. Hopefully someone's interest is piqued by the potential vineyard connection back in 2010.

               there's so much being uncovered here though,, and in the early day's at the chans and on reddit.... at some point all this needs to be collated and sent to real investigators. Don't get me wrong I'm all about meme magic and know kek is with us an that but the most we're gonna do is raise awareness and publicly shame the perps.... in the end we really want arrests right? My biggest faith at the minute is w the NYPD and bits of the FBI [given early rumors/FBIanon]. Do we know who if anyone is building the RICO case against the clinton foundation? Once the crowd sourced investigation has pulled enough info into a digestible form we should get it to them for sure! Would be great if we could ensure that there's some real traction come February...

               Thank you, same here. It seems Kathryn Tate is completely off the internet, no FB, Twitter, Instagram, Snapshot accounts, et al. She probably deleted after the emails were published, which makes her look even more suspicious...
