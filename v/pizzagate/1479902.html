<p><strong>Jesuits &amp; Georgetown University</strong></p>
<p>Georgetown is the oldest Catholic and Jesuit institute of higher learning in the US. (<a href="https://www.worldslastchance.com/end-time-prophecy/10-facts-you-must-know-about-the-jesuits.html">Jesuit\'s are quite strange as they can only be male (and also have some teachings that encourage sociopathic tendencies) </a>)</p>
<p>Now look at the results for this google search &quot;jesuit + satanic cult.&quot;  I need to dig more, but there are certainly strong connections. For example look into the Black Pope (from <a href="https://archive.is/u8ZuG">here</a>): The Superior General of the Society of Jesus, better known as the head of the order, is often referred to as the &quot;Black Pope.&quot;</p>
<p>Wikipedia excerpt: &quot;Comprising nine undergraduate and graduate schools, the university enrolls approximately 7,500 undergraduate and 10,000 post-graduate students from a wide variety of religious, ethnic, and geographic backgrounds, including 130 foreign countries.[9] Georgetown\'s most notable alumni are prominent in public life in the United States and abroad. Among them are former U.S. President Bill Clinton, former U.S. Chief Justice Edward Douglass White, former U.S. Supreme Court Associate Justice Antonin Scalia, dozens of U.S. governors and members of Congress, heads of state or government of more than a dozen countries, royalty and diplomats.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>Three Famous Jesuits</strong></p>
<p>Hopefully you\'ve looked at the history of jesuits (shows a very clear pattern in behavior that\'s even described in a few secret Jesuit books that were leaked a long time ago).  I looked for famous current Jesuits and came across Kevin T Fitzgerald who is currently the chair of healthcare ethics, he has some very very odd research into genetics, and generally interested in eugenics (e.g. his paper &quot;The Need for a Dynamic and Integrative Vision of the Human for the Ethics of Genetics&quot;).  For those that don\'t know (I didn\'t) in 2008 researchers managed to successfully clone a human embryo (the Chinese are currently working on it).</p>
<p>Tim Kaine (HRC\'s VP) is also a Jesuit (his parents were very devout, and went to an all boys Jesuit high school)</p>
<p>Pope Francis (It\'s interesting that the Pope has been talking about fake news, it makes a little more sense now...)</p>
<p><strong>Specific Places for further research:</strong></p>
<p>Hitler/WW2 (Hitler admired the Jesuits\' system, and sought ought and killed many within Germany and Poland)</p>
<p>Pope\'s past and present (one was killed 3 weeks after trying to abolish the Jesuits)</p>
<p>Charity Called Jesuit refugee service <a href="http://jrsusa.org/">http://jrsusa.org/</a> (Look into general Jesuit Charities/Scandals)</p>
<p>Read Secret instructions of the Jesuits <a href="http://www.reformation.org/secret.html">http://www.reformation.org/secret.html</a></p>
<p>Jesuits + Satanism (Look into the founding of the Jesuits, and what happened when the Pope </p>
<p>Look into the religious teachings/groups at Georgewashington University</p>
<p>Use the structure of the Jesuits to find more connections (Black Pope)</p>

            were very fishy. They led me to some websites that were very... weird to say the least. The announcements feel a lot more informal than the ones I get at my university. Maybe there's a special group within the university that these emails are sent to? A lot of them have unnecessary photos attached. I made a post on Reddit about it back in the day and got swamped by shills.
