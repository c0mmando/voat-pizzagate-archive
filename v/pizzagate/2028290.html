<p>Alicia Powe has done some amazing work at WND regarding the Seth Rich case. Notice the picture used in the article about the time she is talking about the IT Party. She uses the pic in question, but never states this was the actual party Seth attended. <a href="http://mobile.wnd.com/files/2017/05/Seth-Rich-FB2.jpg">http://mobile.wnd.com/files/2017/05/Seth-Rich-FB2.jpg</a></p>
<p>People thought one of the guys was Awan because he happens to have a beard and darker color skin, I assume. But I can confirm the man in the pic is most definitely not Awan. It his longtime buddie Miguel Huerta. Here is Huertas own FB post with the pic in question.  <a href="http://archive.is/TVgqe">http://archive.is/TVgqe</a></p>
<p>Here is a pic of Miguel Huerta. <a href="https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10209579590029470&amp;set=a.1377757646859.2048012.1319400243&amp;type=3&amp;theater">https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10209579590029470&amp;set=a.1377757646859.2048012.1319400243&amp;type=3&amp;theater</a></p>
<p>And here is Imran Awan. <a href="https://media.licdn.com/mpr/mpr/shrinknp_200_200/p/1/005/093/18a/15688cb.jpg">https://media.licdn.com/mpr/mpr/shrinknp_200_200/p/1/005/093/18a/15688cb.jpg</a>
Again, just look at this pic of Imran and the man in the picture with Seth and its obviously not Awan. It\'s most definitely Huerta. </p>
<p>Here is more proof of Miguel Huerta and Seth being friends. <a href="http://archive.is/ZIyOJ">http://archive.is/ZIyOJ</a>  If you click on Miguels name on the Venmo link, it shows his handle as MiguelP27. Here is Miguel (miguelp27)  included with the same guys from the pic, in a tweet with the rest of his buddies. Tweet also tags <a href="https://voat.co/user/panda4progress">@panda4progress</a> and mentions Seth\'s name...in case people still don\'t believe Seth was <a href="https://voat.co/user/Panda4progress">@Panda4progress</a>.</p>
<p>Just go through Miguel Huerta\'s FB pics and you can obviously see it is 100% him and 0% Awan. Now this does not mean Seth DID NOT attend an IT PARTY. And who know\'s maybe he did. I\'d like to think so, since thats what Rod Wheeler stated. But what I can say with certainty is that this picture has nothing to do with that IT party. We need to stop spreading this info immediately as it hurts those who are really trying to put pieces together and can you imagine how Miguel may feel if he finds out people think he\'s a wanted arab. Lets make sure this does not spread more than it has.</p>',

             And it very much seems like it is the same person with a different haircut and facial hair.  The nose seems the same as the awan2.jpg picture.  The ears appear the same.  The eyes look the same.  The eyebrows look different from different angles (which I noticed on pause when he looks down).  In certain spots you can see the indentation on his forhead and his hairlines and beard lines match pretty well.  His mouth also looks the same.

             I think because some have been so red pulled recently there's this wave of hysteria as if anything is everything. It's good to question things even within this community. I'll tell ya tho, that DRAG queen was definitely not alefantis. Too porky 🐷

              the fatherhood video is Podesta. I know this from a source who knows, not speculation, guessing or larping. These are LEAKS. Deep down people know it's him. Just like they know he and Tony took Madeleine McCann.

             I thought the same as well.  And then it became some "settled fact".  Pretty minute detail, but it is heartening to think that there are some of us out there that will call out the truth in the face of groupthink.

               Unfortunately every bar and restaurant owner can explain having such cages as they are commonly used to lock up top shelf liquor and other bar/restaurant assets.

            The title you used for your post about Awan brother and Seth Rich may have played a part in the disinformation. Not trying to point fingers, but it was highly upvoated and some people could have interpreted the title wrong or didn't do their homework.

             People must've drew their own conclusions. My intent of the initial post was to discuss two separate and new pieces of information from the Alicia Powe article. I hadn't even made that connection that Awan could have possibly attended the IT party, being as how they are connected to DNC in some way, until someone mentioned that in the comments.
            </p>
            <p>
             I think it was more due to the fact that Powe used the picture at the bar with his friends, right above the section talking about the IT party, and after having talked about Awan. And the pic at the bar was posted near the day of his death. So people prolly just assumed that was the IT party. A post on reddit with the pic Powe used, starting being passed around that had been calling Seths friend Awan, just cuz the guy was dark skinned with a beard. That is what started circulating. Either way, just trying to make the point my intent was simply to share new info, not to stir up disinfo.

             Amazing indeed.  And sad.  It's a huge problem in any research community.   People just take shot and regurgitate it everywhere without bothering to verify for themselves.    Glad to hear someone else feels the same.  +1

              if you scroll almost to the bottom there is a picture. not really used to this phone yet or I would just save the picture. oh and btw, Webb is controlled opposition. most likely mossad

               I think your mistaken. The picture you gave is of Imran Awan, but a completely different Imran Awan. The one you sent works in the UK and is a senior lecturer and is a contributor to The Guardian. Check it out.

                 I'd like to think they actually checked to make sure the man pictured is the right Awan, before broadcasting it around. Guess I gotta look a little more into it.

                  i have been looking for a while now and i cant seem to find the voat thread i thought I saw the other day. well, sorry for the confusion. and while I like tucker, I don't have any reason to trust what the Murdoch's want to air. thegatewaypundit article I linked has a different picture of supposedly imran, but I guess we will have to wait for his trial to see.
