<blockquote>
<p>The man on the phone wants nothing to do with any of this. It is rare that a Russian oligarch/<strong>Semion Mogilevich</strong> should be (relatively) innocent (in this case), of ANYTHING. But the fact stands that this guy actually is innocent of having anything to do with any of the crimes and goings-on with Mari, Monster, or any of them. Oddly enough, though guilty of many things himself — he’s never been accused of even being involved in prostitution. After all, as he says, “This is Russia. If I wanted underage kids? I wouldn’t have to go play over there to do it. I’m a family man with kids of my own. That stuff is disgusting to me.”</p>
<p>But many of the visitors and participants in Monster/<strong>Jeffrey Epstein</strong> &amp; Mari’s/<strong>Ghislaine Maxwell\'s</strong> crimes weren’t there just for the perverted abuses. Some came to “party” (drugs); while others came to hob-nob with the other wealthy and powerful elite. Imagine it as a twisted sort of Rotary Club or Ladies’ Garden Club for ultra-rich elites. Many deals were made there and many partnerships formed.</p>
<p>But the common bonds were always Monster/<strong>Epstein</strong> and Mari/<strong>Maxwell</strong>.</p>
<p>Mari/<strong>Maxwell</strong> is the one dragging the Russian/<strong>Mogilevich</strong> into this. She’s turned to him mainly because of his vast network of “underground” contacts. Also, she knows of his old business deals with her own father/<strong>Robert Maxwell</strong> — and feels she can trust him. Those were old illegal deals involving hundreds of millions of dollars and money laundering. Mari/<strong>Maxwell</strong> has never asked the Russian/<strong>Mogilevich</strong> if he had a hand in her dad’s demise — or if her Dad really did die. She’s more interested in saving herself. The first thing she asked for was to set her up with a trusted (and very competent) plastic surgeon. The Russian/<strong>Mogilevich</strong> knew what this meant, and knew what she has in mind.</p>
<p>If it was just Mari/<strong>Mogilevich</strong> asking, he could avoid her. But it isn’t. Another series of contacts began to bug the oligarch a few months ago. These weren’t as easy to ignore or stall. Because these contacts came from a very special intermediary. The kind you simply don’t refuse. This middle-man reaching out to the Russian was a representative of the ruling family of a nation/<strong>British royal family</strong>. They can be very persuasive.</p>
<p>The ruling family/<strong>British Royal Family</strong> has a big, big problem. They’ve had more than their share in the past — but this one could be far worse. Not just a scandal that exposes a sex offender in the family/<strong>Prince Andrew<strong>. But it could lead to exposing a chain of events and contacts that they’d give up half their kingdom to protect. It’s not some shadowy conspiracy with international banking houses or cartels or insane theories. No, it’s quite black and white and very real. It could lead to exposure of the family’s (and the government’s) very “special” relationship with another country/</strong>Israel</strong>.</p>
<p>That other country/<strong>Israel</strong> has a legendary intelligence/security service/<strong>Mossad<strong>. Since that country has been at war virtually non-stop for all it’s existence? It has honed intelligence craft to a perfect art. That intelligence service/</strong>Mossad</strong> and this family/<strong>British royal family</strong> are tied together far deeper and stronger than anyone will ever publicly admit. Sure, they’re public allies. But by exposing the true depth of the kinship would open up a Pandora’s Box and put many past incidents, accidents, and outright murders under a microscope that nobody wants. It’s a chain reaction that can never be brought to light in modern media.</p>
<p>Mari’s/<strong>Maxwell\'s</strong> own father/<strong>Robert Maxwell</strong> was part of the extended family of that country’s intelligence service/<strong>Mossad</strong>; and his own country’s/<strong>MI6<strong>. It was a relationship used to great effect for many years, and many times. It was one of the reasons her father was able to avoid being ruined and imprisoned many times. Thus, as a result — her father/</strong>Robert Maxwell</strong> also was close to the ruling family/<strong>British royal family</strong>. But Mari/<strong>Maxwell</strong> was much, much closer in a “biblical” way.</p>
<p>She had sexual relations with a very important man in that family/<strong>Prince Andrew</strong>. He’s not as important as his brother/<strong>Prince Charles</strong> but very important. We’ll call him the “SIDE RULER”. His past indiscretions in sex and business have been hard for the family to cover up. He publicly dated porn stars, and gleefully procured prostitutes -even while married. As such, he’s been a nightmare for his country’s security services. The ruling family/<strong>British royal family</strong> has had many occasions to lock down the media and cover up various offenses of their family members. But this time would not be so easy; since it didn’t even occur on their home turf.</p>
<p>When the “Side Ruler”/<strong>Prince Andrew</strong> began to party with Mari/<strong>Maxwell</strong> and Monster/<strong>Epstein</strong>, it wasn’t only the sex — but the business deals. Ruler/<strong>Prince Andrew</strong> has always tried to hustle a buck, and to party with all these billionaires was irresistible. So while sexually abusing teen girls, he was also putting together very rewarding business deals. All structured through proxies and shell companies. For the other elites, it was a grand chance to hob-nob with a member of the ruling family. Though he was “cash poor” his family still held massive holdings and massive influence around the world.</p>
<p>Mari/<strong>Maxwell</strong> had been having trysts with him for years. She and Ruler/<strong>Prince Andrew</strong> were known to party with others, male and female and it never drew much attention until Mari/<strong>Maxwell</strong> and Monster’s/<strong>Epstein\'s</strong> actions began to draw heat. In the words of one member of the ruling family who knows all about it — the act of trying to erase the Ruler’s/<strong>Prince Andrew\'s</strong> links to Mari/<strong>Maxwell</strong> &amp; Monster/<strong>Epstein</strong>: “is like trying to get the toothpaste back in the tube.”</p>
<p>So a member of the Ruler’s/<strong>Prince Andrew\'s</strong> security services was appointed to try and bury or handle the entire situation for Side Ruler/<strong>Prince Andrew<strong>. This guy — this go-between/middle man — knew instantly that Mari/</strong>Maxwell</strong> was the weak link. She had much to lose, and could be compromised. So they focused on her, and getting her in line. While doing surveillance on her, they discovered Mari’s/<strong>Maxwell</strong> reaching out to the Russian oligarch/<strong>Mogilevich</strong>.</p>
<p>The Russian/<strong>Mogilevich</strong> was friends with the ruling family too, for other reasons. Mostly diplomatic or to secure his visas and finances in that country. He “donated” nearly a billion dollars of his fortune to various fronts that always swung back to the ruling family/<strong>British royal family<strong>. So when the middle man contacted the Russian/</strong>Mogilevich</strong> for a “favor”, he knew that he could be in deep shit; out in the cold; if he were to not oblige.</p>
<p>Since he/<strong>Mogilevich</strong> is on very thin ice with other Western nations already? He said he’d do what he can to help the family/<strong>British royal family<strong>. So he’s allowed the intelligence service to hear every word he and Mari/</strong>Maxwell</strong> discuss. No matter how painful it can be for him — he knows the ruling family/<strong>British royal family</strong> will protect him, and re-pay the favor. At least he hopes they will and will keep him out of Mari’s/<strong>Maxwell\'s</strong> shit-storm. The last thing he needs is legal system attention.</p>
<p>Back when Monster/<strong>Epstein</strong> and Mari/<strong>Maxwell</strong> first began to come under the spotlight for their crimes, they turned to a “dream team” of the best attorneys they could find. This was lead by a lawyer/<strong>Alan Dershowitz</strong> who had done more than just be friends with Monster/<strong>Epstein</strong> and Mari/<strong>Maxwell</strong> — he was a participant. This guy/<strong>Dershowitz</strong> had repped Monster/<strong>Epstein</strong>, who was his pal, for years. His image and legal community standing was beyond reproach and as a fighter for justice.</p>
<p>Mari/<strong>Maxwell</strong> had another friend (also mentioned earlier) who was an elite, wealthy, powerful lady we called “Princess”/<strong>Kerry Kennedy<strong>. Her family was political royalty and not just powerful but maybe the most powerful in the halls of lawmaking and justice. Princess/</strong>Kennedy</strong> had a carefully crafted image of good deeds and noble causes she gave herself to. As did her then-husband, another political legacy himself/<strong>Andrew Cuomo</strong>. So Princess/<strong>Kennedy</strong> knew how the game was played, and how the wheels were greased.</p>
<p>Princess/<strong>Kennedy</strong> found herself in trouble a few years back. When she did — she turned to a bulldog attorney/<strong>Jerry Lefcourt</strong> who fixed not just her legal problems, but her spin control. His main strategy was to attack the victims and undermine the cops and prosecutors. In fact this wasn’t the first time Princess/<strong>Kennedy</strong> had to rely on that (or any) legal bulldog to get her out of trouble.</p>
<p>A couple of years before her public arrest for DUI, the Princess/<strong>Kennedy</strong> had another accident. That one was a single-car accident with no victim and it all “went away” before any charges were filed. Why? Her attorney in that case was a trusted legal scholar who knew the local prosecutor in the area of the wreck. A few calls, a few laughs, and it was gone. No victim, no harm, no foul. That legal scholar is the same one we call “Lawyer 2”/<strong>Dershowitz</strong>.</p>
<p>Several years before THAT wreck, however, Princess/<strong>Kennedy</strong> got herself in an even earlier jam. (Her first of the three we’ve mentioned — you’d think she would’ve learned). She had another wreck, while she was very intoxicated. She was married at that time, and her hubby’s name/<strong>Cuomo</strong> carried as much weight as her own in their home state. But Princess/<strong>Kennedy</strong> had rear-ended a car while wasted.</p>

            Back when Monster/

            and Mari/

            </strong>
            first began to come under the spotlight for their crimes, they turned to a “dream team” of the best attorneys they could find. This was lead by a lawyer/
            <strong>
             Alan Dershowitz
            </strong>
            who had done more than just be friends with Monster/

            and Mari/

            , who was his pal, for years. His image and legal community standing was beyond reproach and as a fighter for justice.

            <strong>
             Maxwell

            had another friend (also mentioned earlier) who was an elite, wealthy, powerful lady we called “Princess”/
            <strong>
             Kerry Kennedy
             <strong>
              . Her family was political royalty and not just powerful but maybe the most powerful in the halls of lawmaking and justice. Princess/
             </strong>
             Kennedy
            </strong>
            had a carefully crafted image of good deeds and noble causes she gave herself to. As did her then-husband, another political legacy himself/
            <strong>
             Andrew Cuomo
            </strong>
            . So Princess/
            <strong>
             Kennedy
            </strong>
            knew how the game was played, and how the wheels were greased.
           </p>
           <p>
            Princess/
            <strong>
             Kennedy
            </strong>
            found herself in trouble a few years back. When she did — she turned to a bulldog attorney/
            <strong>
             Jerry Lefcourt
            </strong>
            who fixed not just her legal problems, but her spin control. His main strategy was to attack the victims and undermine the cops and prosecutors. In fact this wasn’t the first time Princess/
            <strong>
             Kennedy
            </strong>
            had to rely on that (or any) legal bulldog to get her out of trouble.
           </p>
           <p>
            A couple of years before her public arrest for DUI, the Princess/
            <strong>
             Kennedy
            </strong>
            had another accident. That one was a single-car accident with no victim and it all “went away” before any charges were filed. Why? Her attorney in that case was a trusted legal scholar who knew the local prosecutor in the area of the wreck. A few calls, a few laughs, and it was gone. No victim, no harm, no foul. That legal scholar is the same one we call “Lawyer 2”/
            <strong>
             Dershowitz
            </strong>
            .
           </p>
           <p>
            Several years before THAT wreck, however, Princess/
            <strong>
             Kennedy
            </strong>
            got herself in an even earlier jam. (Her first of the three we’ve mentioned — you’d think she would’ve learned). She had another wreck, while she was very intoxicated. She was married at that time, and her hubby’s name/
            <strong>
             Cuomo
            </strong>
            carried as much weight as her own in their home state. But Princess/
            <strong>
             Kennedy
            </strong>
            had rear-ended a car while wasted.

             attacked and threatened the poor teenage kid into submission. By the time they were done with the kid and the kid’s family? They merely accepted an agreement to cover the repairs to the kid’s car. There was never even a police report or any trace of it in the legal system. Both the bulldog/

             could save their asses? Naturally Princess/

              Kennedy
             </strong>
             referred the same attorneys.
            </p>
            <p>
             Their track records of “attacking the victim” and using investigators to “background” the accusers, detectives, and prosecutors was legendary. Those that could not be bought off, or who were not friends willing to trade favors — were threatened, attacked, or scared off. Both of these lawyers would create such chaos; cross-suits; and then spin so much politically-motivated bullshit that it would cloud the entire civil and criminal landscape around Monster/
             <strong>
              Epstein

             .
            </p>
            <p>
             This was what made these attorneys so feared.
            </p>
            <p>
             They even got the District Attorney in the jurisdiction in New York/
             <strong>
              Cy Vance
             </strong>
             to go to bat for Monster/
             <strong>
              Epstein
             </strong>
             to make his punishment EASIER. So brazenly, that even the judge hearing the case admonished the A.D.A. for arguing FOR the Monster/

              Epstein
             </strong>

              Vance

              Sean Penn
             </strong>
             is leaving for a long vacation. He’s the same A-Lister who found himself a guest at one of Monster/
             <strong>
              Epstein
             </strong>
             and Mari’s/
             <strong>
              Maxwell's
             </strong>
             parties in that foreign country/
             <strong>
              Venezuela
             </strong>
             .
            </p>
            <p>
             It figures since he was friends with the ruler of that country/
             <strong>
              Hugo Chavez
             </strong>
             . But the A-Lister/
             <strong>
              Penn
             </strong>
             (who is either a director or actor or even maybe a little of both), never took part in the sexual abuse. He was more interested in the drugs and networking. He also was interested in his habit of documenting his travels.
            </p>
            <p>
             The A-lister/
             <strong>
              Penn
             </strong>
             had, in fact, quite a collection of his home videos. Some of these are historical and others are very private. He always planned to keep them “sealed” until after his death, then have a filmmaker assemble them once unsealed. Back when he visited the estate to party with Mari/
             <strong>
              Maxwell
             </strong>
             and Monster/
             <strong>
              Epstein
             </strong>
             , he took his small camera and recorded the festivities. Until it was suggested to him that he stop immediately. But he had already recorded many of the elite, famous, and powerful guests and some of their partying.
            </p>
            <p>
             What he recorded was not so much anything of a criminal nature, but was actual proof of people who were there — and who they were with. It is proof that contradicts statements of VERY powerful people who deny being at Monster/
             <strong>
              Epstein

              Maxwell's
             </strong>
             “parties” (or only knowing them briefly years ago). It would be enough to support many of the charges by showing visual proof of who was with who.
            </p>
            <p>
             In short, it may not be a smoking gun, but it’s a helluva loaded one.

             The A-Lister/
             <strong>
              Penn
             </strong>
             knew he had the video, and tore his home and office apart trying to find it. Only then did he realize it was gone. That was the only missing video he had ever “lost”. He was dumbstruck at the thought of it being misplaced, until he wondered if it could be connected to a burglary a few years ago at his home. A lot was ransacked, a few worthless items taken, and it was written off as delinquents.
            </p>
            <p>
             Cops never found anyone who did it. No prints. But they ignored valuables, electronics, and other things. He wondered if this single video (from his immaculately-numbered and documented collection of videos), was taken. Perhaps it was the purpose of the entire burglary? It’s never taken much for the A-Lister/

             This A-Lister/
             <strong>
              Penn
             </strong>
             is packing his bags, because he doesn’t want to find out who took it or why. He — just like Mari/
             <strong>
              Maxwell
             </strong>
             and others — just wants the entire memory gone. He says that only a few knew he was taping, and those who did were mostly too drunk or high to recall. But Mari/
             <strong>
              Maxwell
             </strong>
             surely knows. She’s the one who asked him to stop the recording at the party. So now the A-lister/
             <strong>
              Penn
             </strong>
             is going on vacation to avoid subpoenas, gossip, rumors…or worse. His career and life may not be at the heights it once was, but he still wants to live it and keep working too. “Hard to do that from a grave or a cell”, he says.
            </p>
            <p>
             Everyone is now looking at Mari/
             <strong>
              Maxwell
             </strong>
             to see what will happen next.
            </p>
            <p>
             If there was real justice, everything that Monster/
             <strong>
              Epstein
             </strong>
             and Mari/
             <strong>
              Maxwell
             </strong>
             have or ever had would be sold off and liquidated and compensation given to the victims. At least 70 documented victims, and countless others never known to the outside world. Mari/
             <strong>
              Maxwell
             </strong>
             would spend the rest of her life in jail. But she would be forced to talk and tell everything about EVERYBODY. Then they would pay for their crimes accordingly. The victims would be given voices, and be believed.
            </p>
            <p>
             But that won’t happen. They covers-ups have begun; the denials; and the attacks on the victims. The clouded landscape is providing so much smoke that the guilty could even slip away unnoticed. Yet, even if some justice happens, it would be a start.
            </p>
            <p>
             But even now, people are running scared; cutting deals; destroying evidence; bribing officials; and threatening witnesses. Even now, plans are being made to silence some people forever. With all that is at stake in a truly global nightmare like this one? You can bet the full truth will not come out. Even after many of the powerful are dead — their legacies will be protected. The blame will ALL be put on those dead or dying soon.

             can run, and she can even hide — but somebody, somewhere, sometime will catch up with her. Ironic that she may find an ending so similar to her own father. But I know this: that if the Russian/
             <strong>
              Mogilevich
             </strong>
             is forced to help her in her escape plans? Others will know. Because he will not sit back and let her evade justice forever. Even that ruling family/
             <strong>
              British royal family
             </strong>
             will take some type of action to tie up that loose end.
            </p>
            <p>
             Since we don’t yet know what the Russian/
             <strong>
              Mogilevich
             </strong>
             will do; and Mari/
             <strong>
              Maxwell
             </strong>
             hasn’t made her request besides “seeing the doctor”? Then we still don’t know how it all plays out. Even the authorities have yet to pounce. She may have surgery to alter her face/body and go on the lam. She may fake her own suicide or murder. She may actually kill herself or be killed by others. She may even be arrested and caught before she runs. Because if others know what she’s planning — better believe the cops/security services also know. Whether they act on it (or are allowed to act on it) may be a different story.

             I know that many people believe in conspiracy theories; and still many more would not believe the truth — no matter how seemingly far-fetched — even with proof in front of them. Just remember that old saying: “Conspiracy isn’t a theory — it’s a crime”. Please keep in mind that a lot of the chaos around these cases and this nightmare has been created for just this exact purpose. The criminals know how fractured the US (and the world) is now politically and socially…and they use that to blind and distort the horrific truths.

             These lawyers hired by Mari/

             </strong>
             (and Monster/

             earlier) create and push the narrative so people get distracted. They shift the blame to shadowy groups or titans of politics and wealth who are (rightly or wrongly) “evil personified”. This is what they want to happen, because it makes “small” the acts of the violators. Worst of all, it minimizes the damage done to those who suffered.

             I hope -and respectfully ask- that you will please remember that no matter which side of what political debate you may be on — this is NOT a case about politics. It is a case about a series of CRIMES. The real core of this entire nightmare comes down to a large group of underage, young girls and boys who were lured and forced into being victims. Some manipulated; others damaged beyond repair. Innocence lost; and lives destroyed.
            </p>
            <p>
             And all for what?
            </p>
            <p>
             So some powerful, elite, rich, twisted jackasses could get their kicks?
            </p>
            <p>
             So that some sick, twisted, greedy shit-heels could get leverage over others?
            </p>
            <p>
             Nobody involved in the crimes of this nightmare is without some degree of guilt. All we can do is to hope that surely some degree of justice will come. Perhaps it will, for the guilty are still out there — still available to be held to account for their actions. The only true justice is that they be turned over to an impartial, unbiased justice system and forced to tell all. Otherwise, somebody, somewhere will hold them accountable for their crimes; their damages; their perversions of justice for this most disgusting “nasty business”.
            </p>
            <p>
             Either in this life, or the next.
            </p>
            <p>
             For the sake of the victims? Let’s hope it is soon.
