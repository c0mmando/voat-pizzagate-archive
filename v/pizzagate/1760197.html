            Since it is fairly clear that CP is used for blackmail, and it makes a lot of sense when you think about it, using the most vile thing you can think of against someone,  how are we supposed to know when these cases are real or ultimately fabricated?
           </p>
           <p>
            Is it when the circumstances don't add up like in this case with the unusual bail amount?

            When "professional wrestling" was fairly new and people suspected it was scripted, the wrestlers insisted it was completely real. No one is thinking that now. We know it is entertainment, just like fake news is--a pacifier for the sheep.
           </p>
           <p>
            We cannot be discouraged by people refusing to look at pizzagate because they believe MSM or the like, because if we continue to focus on evidence and real cases, eventually there will enough that even the sheep can't ignore it.
           </p>
           <p>
            People who otherwise may not even know about pizzagate, might be so shocked at the idea that someone like a pro wrestler has CP, that they may now look further into it. It's a possibility.
           </p>
           <p>
            We have to continue to build this, block by block, adding such current cases like the one above, as well as any mention of govt officials, elites, past incidents, and background on SRA, cannibalism, etc. until no one can deny it anymore.

              I submitted different posts in this vein and they were instantly deleted by "millennialfalcon".
I wonder what is going on with voat.
The case is already made that these "in your backyard arrests" must be reported.

              The judge sets a bail amount based on the crime, the defendants history and how much of a flight risk they are. Once it is set, you can pay a bondsman to take on the full amount of bail for a fraction of the total amount as a bond, usually putting up collateral if a huge amount, and then they keep a % of it after its all over.
             </p>
             <p>
              I would consider him a flight risk since this is going to ruin his career and life basically. Why not cash out and try to make it in mexico or somewhere you can disappear with enough cash.
