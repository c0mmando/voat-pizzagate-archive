            Go to masonicmoney.blogspot.com that is where they are initiating various African countries. This one is in Swahili. They kill chickens and a blood relative and even pay to join.They are so desperate for a penny, they join this crap. They have that site, connected to the Ohio lodge.
           </p>
           <p>
            Then on Facebook, a Africa country gal from there, in NYC, initiates illuluminati on Facebook, connected to this. Her friend list is quite revealing of the blacks to white corporations/ Arab and more.  Won't write her name here, as voat guidelines say not too ( I think).
Her and a lot are even putting their phone numbers out on Feb and blog for this criminal crap. A male friend, that comments on her page; he has a post of buying stolen goods...))) 
Desperate, and low IQ, easy manipulated are always so sloppy. 
Florida is another state fighting to bring satanic into school, coloring books of savage violence. Did some event or tried to with the governor RS.
           </p>
           <p>
            Neilbrick.com been trying to expose for years. Was a victim. He gets harrased by them all the time.
           </p>
           <p>
            He wrote up different ways they use hand signals, smells, words to continue to brain wash victims and infiltrate the victims from healing.
           </p>
           <p>
            His site connects to other good links in ritual.pedo abuse and a site called Propoganda that has mass info to use for memes on exposing this, calling out the fake news, and more strategic insight.
           </p>
           <p>
            But there you go, two initiating sites, Facebook, the blog, and her fb friend list has other iniators. The loser males that join for money hopes, write up the gorry initiation process; so if any can archive it asap,!!!! )) Hope someone who can archive, gathers all this archive, asap...)) Really wish, knew who to pm stuff too..first..ughhh please hurry..))
           </p>
           <p>
            Emailed voat security and privacy emails. Someone hacking my voat account. Way shady, illegal, stalking, invasive, creepy, unnaceptable. Here to try to help save kids nation, world with any legits, not get this shady, unsafe crap. Really not worth the investing time to be abnormal safety concerns, for ANYONE. This goes beyond shill to illegal. Already very clear that Breitbart, Haiti Journalist and bothers were not working with peeps that cared life not expendible. Dang creepy.

            I read that the FBI walked into Norway to "help" them with this. Which took an entire year. I think that, perhaps, this is a way to create a noose for the American people involved that cannot be arrested at this time. Or perhaps the Norway operation concluded a bit too soon.
           </p>
           <p>
            I don't think we have a correct picture of who is at war here.
           </p>
           <p>
            CIA + Clinton cabal work together and have a multitude of sensitive operations going on right now destabilizing governments and creating commercial opportunities for the Cabal.
           </p>
           <p>
            FBI know that child abuse is an immense problem in the US. Normally they will arrest edge players but they cannot pull on strings because it all leads back to the summit of power (state or national level) and they cannot make a move on people protected by the CIA. So they make us think that pedophiles are lonely men who operate alone when social media tells us that nope, people who abuse children collaborate internationally and have a very sophisticated commercial enterprise. The fact that the US generates most of hardcore porn and half of child porn is incredibly bad for the image of the US in the world. Also, since this is tied to the infrastructure of child protection and philanthropy, it's systematically entrenched into the system. How many ways is it bad for the elite if the FBI does their job? Bad, in, every, single, way. So we should assume that the FBI (and local law enforcement) is prevented from doing their job because of "threats to national security".
           </p>
           <p>
            The media has been protecting but also promoting pedophiles for ages. The podesta leaks show us how The Washington Post and The New York Times are medias that, through strategic acquisitions and placements, now exist to serve the image of the elites and protect them from negative attention. The media is friends and family with the people involved in Pizzagate. How can we trust the information they put forth?
           </p>
           <p>
            These are three powerful organizations. But CIA + Clinton seem to have the most power in this whole set. We should expect a major distraction event before January 20, 2017 aimed to either strip Trump of his "Presidentship" or aimed at occupying the Trump administration fully while everybody moves to the homes The Podesta Group has helped everyone buy on The Palm in Dubai.

            If you're wondering why you keep getting downvoats, it's likely because you've posted this same thing across multiple posts. I'm not accusing you of anything, but it does make your behavior a bit suspect, or at the very least, looking for free/easy upvoats.

              Yes that AND it's actually the name of a real CIA operation to infiltrate the Media and pump out their propaganda - Operation Mockingbird
             </p>
             <p>
              Operation Mockingbird was a secret campaign by the United States Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) to influence media. Begun in the 1950s, it was initially organized by Cord Meyer and Allen W. Dulles, and was later led by Frank Wisner after Dulles became the head of the CIA. The organization recruited leading American journalists into a network to help present the CIA's views, and funded some student and cultural organizations, and magazines as fronts.

             </p>
             <p>
              FBI agents conducting undercover investigations have now been given the green light to impersonate journalists, the Justice Department determined last week — effectively legalizing the government’s most notorious propaganda program, Operation Mockingbird.
