Repost over the “barroom brawl fiasco”. I’ve learned from previous mistakes and have learned how to craft basic memes, so all we have to do is spread them like wild fire.  Given the reporting about R Kelly, this is the PERFECT timing for this operation. We need to strike RUTHLESSLY while the iron is still hot.</p>
<p>This is a call to unity for all true pedo hunters and truthers. No infighting or making an ass of yourself.</p>
<p>Some background information on why I’m so passionate about this case. I was a fan of her work when I was a kid. I then found out she was killed before The Land Before Time got released. 30 years later, I find out the truth of the matter was even worse, reopening some old grief. Further investigation revealed shattered one narrative and replaced a tragic death with an even worse demise.</p>
<p>So yeah, this case is deeply personal as far as I’m concerned. I will not rest until her death has been avenged.</p>
<p><a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/2945876">https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/2945876</a> The entire 1 year long investigation into the rape and murder of Judith Barsi that leads to this very meme war operation.</p>

CDAN is probably our most effective weapon for redpilling people about Hollywood pedophiles. We can use Enty’s accurate reporting of Harvey Weinstein, Kevin Spacy, and Matt Laur as evidence that what we’re claiming is true.</p>
<p>Operation Name: Operation Yep Yep Yep.</p>
<p>Objectives: Raise awarness about Hollywood pedophiles by correlating Pedowood with a death that broke the hearts of millions of Americans. Raise awareness of a Pedowood case that gets WAY less reporting among patriots than it rightly deserves. Finally, forceably tear off the shield protecting elite pedos that is Operation Mockingbird. Tear off the shield, you make it easy for people to believe Pizzagate is real.</p>
<p>Target audience: Normies. Which means any memes you want to create need to be normie friendly!!!</p>
<p>Scope: Take the memes that I have created below and spread them across social media, twitter, gab, 4chan, /pol, and 8chan like wildfire. This needs to get VIRAL!!!</p>
<p>Hashtags to use in your posts: #Pedowood #MeToo (we are going to hijack this and repurpose it against the pedos, think transmute a tool of darkness into a weapon of light), #HerNameWasJudithBarsi (thank you <a href="https://voat.co/u/Vindicator">@Vindicator</a> for this idea), #OperationYepYepYep, #JustAsk, #StolenInnocence</p>
<p>From experience, using #MeToo works. I red pilled a liberal about Hollywood pedos (he now believes Pedogate is real despite being liberal) by refering to CDAN being the source of the claims about Heather O’Rourke and Judith Barsi.</p>
<p>Timing: Fuck timing. Just start barraging. Full scale arming of the meme cannons, for this is full scale war against Hollywood pedophiles and Operation Mocking Bird.</p>

            Brian Singer was trending today, so I dropped a meme thread for you on Twitter. I don't have many followers, and Jack Posobiec was tweeting about Singer a lot, so I dropped the link as a reply to a couple of his tweets. We'll see if it goes anywhere. Here's my thread:

            What about Alex Acosta. Trump appointed him Labor Secretary. He's the one who gave Epstein a real sweetheart deal. Why don't you guys discuss that hmmm?

              and swmbo does not accept this and calls me a liar. I will try one more time. nope failed twice. I used a pattern of numbers I had created on the fly and forgot what method I had created to generate the numbers. All I remember is it has something to do with 3 which doesnt help much. So why dont you drop this /war/, please, goof. Or demand something reasonable that I can do. Like I said, You could torture me for a million years and not find the pass, but thats just my opinion. You think Im always a liar, but assure you, this time, Im giving you my honest opinions. Or how about this: Given reasons to the public why you want to push for full society co-operation towards the destruction of a single, not-active, 2 comment, voat.co account. ?

              check it out bro: you just used Judith Barsi awareness to "go after" "your personnal troll" who was leaving you alone. (maybe that was the problem). also why put yourself out there at all when you are "scared of blow-back" ? and trying to get me to do the dirty work. tired of your shit. get the fuck off this page.

              omg. im just another paid government troll like you all are. im trying to destroy
              <em>
               pizzagate
              </em>
              isnt its obvious. do not claim to be part of Pizzagate, thats MY identity and you are making it look BAD by being a part of it. (im deffinately a liar, one way or another) my
              <em>
               friend
              </em>
              might by pushing "love and kindness" as if anyone knows what those words mean. but i do not know how to do what my friend asks of me. the best i can hope for is to exist un-emotionally and disconnected but that is not possible either. as for relationships with  voat mods and goobers: will not effect me being myself. You think i am doing harm to what? your image? you dont need make-up when you can make up compelling arguments. lets agree to be
              <em>
               enemies
              </em>
              or at least not be
              <em>
               together
              </em>
              . i came here to talk and i will.

                FAQ
I have not consumed alcohol in over three years. will you repeat your next, most important, question? oh ya: Why am I trolling you. Answer: if you are vonerable to being trolled because of my handle thats lame. You never answered any of my questions ever. My reaction: I left you alone. hewhoneverobeys is not your handle, get over it.

And you remind me of someone ive read before. im here to judge and to be judged. I dont mind being called your stalker. How quaint. Mostly this handle is silly and makes me laugh. How are you? do know about targeting? Do you that satanic cults got together in the 1400s to document their world domination plans and encode their opinion of man into law that "humans are bad". A criminal thinking error used by idiotic criminals to justify doing crime. ? Do you know about propaganda? Do you know about divide and conquer? Do you know about pointing the finger at "ordinary men" when the people or machines responsible for the mess, we are expected to clean up, are far from ordinary men. from: he to: she

            I agree. It might have been a psy-op in the beginning, but it has had an amazing impact in several countries, not only in the Western world.
           </p>
           <p>
            I also use it to redpill people about Hollywood pedophilia - you can always start with Harvey Weinstein, and then casually mention that there are also men - producers and directors - that are pedophiles.
           </p>
           <p>
            Then mention the name of a former child star who OD'D, and say that he likely killed himself due to the sexual abuse he suffered.
           </p>
           <p>
            Then suggest they watch 'An Open Secret', the documentary about child abuse in Hollywood (yes, I know that the film and its makers have also been criticized, but it's still a good starting point for normies).
           </p>
