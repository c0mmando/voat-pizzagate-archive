            No it is worse than you think. Where was J.D. on Halloween 2009 and what character was he dressed as? Why was there such intense effort to keep it hidden? who is the real life former child murder suspect he is friends with and why?

            It is extremely important not to undermine wikileaks and Assange right now. They just released part 3 of Vault 7 which indicate the entire "russian hacking" narrative is even more of an obvious CIA scam than we all thought. Julian might be arrested this week depending on the outcome of the Ecuadorian election. They need our support now more than ever. Wikileaks are one of the only credible groups standing between us and the deep state.

            Really.

           <p>
            Also the whistleblower , Sarah, died before Hamilton - Byrne, which breaks my heart.
           </p>
           <p>
            They took Sarah and somehow got her to reconcile with "Mother" before her death.
           </p>
           <p>
            Actually reading farther, the "reconciliation" was a result of Hamilton - Byrne's descent into Dementia?
Dunno? Other headlines read differently

            Abuse may be the tool, but mind control is the goal.

            It is well known for years that cults, pop music, TV programming, etc. are all creations of intelligence agencies: CIA/MI6/Mossad. We might include MSM "news" in that list, per Operation Mockingbird.
           </p>
           <p>
            Dave McGowan produced extensive research on the "hippy movement" as a creation of Naval Intelligence before he died suddenly of a rare "lung cancer". The Indonesian cult Subud, the Muslim Brotherhood, and the rest are entirely synthetic.
           </p>
           <p>
            Miles Mathis has written a paper called "A Game of Fakes" which is worth a look, as are others he has written--at least he is thinking for himself and doing his own research.
           </p>
           <p>
            Keep in mind what William Colby said at his first meeting as head of the CIA in 1981, "We will know our disinformation program is complete when everything the American people believe is a lie."

            Most people do not realize Julian Assange is the editor or face of Wikileaks. If you believe he is publishing documents from the embassy you are fooled. He was a member of the family which is a CIA operation itself. The Family actually visited BillClinton and HRC in the 90's at the whitehouse. There are pictures. Two of these children also escaped and became well known actors. One died at "the Viper room" in Hollywood. His brother is an A list actor now. This does connect Hollywood pedophelia and D.C. In more ways than you can imagine.
           </p>
           <p>
            Assange did not start out just publishing against HRC. He is furious at governments power to hide behind National Security as a cover for horrible crimes. This is personal if you have watched his interviews you know this. It is unknown if he is actually in the embassy anymore.

             I think that's a different "Family" The one with "Mark [ed] Dice" was L.A based and Hollywood related.
            </p>
            <p>
             Hamilton - Byrne was a different group, at least to all appearances. They lived part year in the Catskill Mnt. NYC, And otherwise in Austrailia.. They were for a short time in Santa Monica..
            </p>
            <p>
             Hamilton - Byrne's was called "The White Brotherhood" FWIW
            </p>
            <p>
             they were also apparently called "The Family" So was the Manson crowd. Different cults though

            Julian Assange's life is at stake right now.

           <p>
            Ecuadoran voters will elect a new president Sunday, and one of the two candidates, the conservative former banker Guillermo Lasso, has pledged to evict the WikiLeaks founder from the country's embassy in London within 30 days of taking office.

              I am aware of the locations of the groups. Different locations does not necessitate a lack of relationship. The finders were involved in child trafficking, and international "currency transfer" - the Family in Australia gave the children multiple passports, etc. So both groups were acting internationally and their connections were obviously not limited to local geographic location. The groups existed at similar times and were both closely related to intelligence agencies. So it seems pretty clear to me that there would be reason to
              <em>
               look into,
              </em>
              not assume connection. I believe I read there is a further connection but I do not have the source for that at hand this instant.

               Maybe they were connected on a higher lever. But I don't think that is obviously the case.

               There is a reason they use the word "Family" for their cults - to do with social engineering.
              </p>
              <p>
               Plus, if the children call their owner's "family" the perps are less likely to get caught or have attention called to themselves.
              </p>
              <p>
               It was different projects; likely run, at the top, by the same clique?
              </p>
              <p>
               Manson was a different group; with likely a different purpose. i.e. Social Engineering / Propaganda / "Strategy of Tension" / Blackwashing Hippies et cetera.
              </p>
              <p>
               Also called a "Family"

             You call being holed up in one or perhaps two rooms to the point that you've forgotten what sunlight looks like enjoying personal protection? I am willing to concede there are things about this story we do not know, but the idea that he's being protected by anything other than inviolable foreign embassy protocol is not logical.

               The PTB is subject to mistakes and poor execution, pun not intended. They also cannot kill all adversaries at will whenever they feel like. There are processes enacted in order to coverup effectively, which don't always go as planned. Of course there have been countless whistleblowers murdered or suicided, but I maintain Assange got lucky, and/or had a hand from providence. If you read his deposition of November 2016, he tells the entire story of moving from place to place with help from a loyal group of friends, and trying to avoid situations that would lead to his assassination. He eventually fell prey to a setup which put him in the situation of potentially being thrown in jail. The rape story was a fabrication through and through, and had things gone according to plan, Assange would have been in a Swedish Jail long ago, and then renditioned to the U.S.A. to disappear forever. I believe that was plan A of the PTB, but it went south because Assange is smarter than them.
              </p>
              <p>
               Remember, when you're handed lemons, you make lemonade, and by my reckoning, the intelligence community was handed a whole plantation of lemon trees by Assange time and again, and in the absence of being able to kill or capture him, they would love nothing better than to have people (especially followers) fall for the contingency that Assange is a Russian Agent, protected, double agent, or some other deception.

            He says he wasn't in it, just a rumour because he lived near them and had the same blonde hair pale skin look as the stolen &amp; adopted kids. It wasn't a sexual type cult, just a money and power hungry one.

             The "rumor" goes; Julian's mother had a rockstar boyfriend, he happened to be affiliated with the cult in some way. When they went on the lam it was because aforementioned boyfie became abusive and threatened their lives.

              According to Sarah there was heavy abuse and conditioning, boys were sold. 
That's why when AHB traveled she supposedly just coincidentally have ~ 10 daughters who all dressed alike, like the Trapp Singers; all supposedly related, but no boys. .

             Naturally, if you study the cult you'd realize that if Assange was brought up in it, they would be lying afterward.
            </p>
            <p>
             The stories his "Mom" and him tell of how "he" was on the run from this cult don't add up. The places they lived were said to be known. i.e. they were not in hiding. Also, there's no record of schools he attended. And they use the "on the lam" as an excuse - yet wouldn't he have attended some schools, under a pseudonym?
            </p>
            <h2>
             All the children in this cult had multiple names, passports, birthdays which were assigned to them . Look closer and you'll also see "What are the chances?"

            I had actually forgotten about the fact that Julian and his family had escaped a cult when he was young. In Australia there was a great mini series documentary done on Julian Assange's life.
            <a href="https://www.screenaustralia.gov.au/the-screen-guide/t/underground---the-julian-assange-story-2012/30851/">

            </a>
            Its really sad thinking about it actually because it rated really well and was not approved by Assange or his family.. Typical of Industries profiting of peoples stories and not helping them out in return. Assange is a hero to me and I hope one day all of Australia will view him as such.
