<p>To me, all of this suggests that she is a mostly-botted (or insanity-driven) account that has been activated for the deep state\'s last Hail Mary play to distract you all and cause burnout on the mod team with Jem777\'s unsubstantiated &quot;death&quot;.</p>

            You're being played by GothamGirl and others. It's a psychological roundabout game designed to make you question yourself, your judgement, your foundation, and throw you into fight-or-flight defense. Once that instinctual neurochemical process begins, it's incredibly easy to manipulate your victim and create an illusion that the rest of society sees as your victim being the one with the problem instead of you. This, of course, furthers that fight-or-flight response to defend ones self and the cycle repeats ad nauseam.
           </p>
           <p>
            Makes you feel fucking crazy, doesn't it? That's exactly what it's intended to do.
           </p>
           <p>
            She should be labeled as dangerous, along with this RIPJem screamer who accused moderators of being complacent in the crime of murder, which would be a red flag to even a first-year psychology student.

              To anyone paying attention:  Note her reaction.  She took completely irrelevant comments made by me, and threw them out here in an attempt to force a fight-or-flight response in me to defend myself.
             </p>
             <p>
              This detracts from her nefarious intentions, redirects the spotlight from her actions to mine.

             <p>
              It's classic psycho-social manipulation. She's just not really good at it.

              The fact that you used the word "we" to describe yourself is somewhat neurotic.  Your handlers did an awful job trying to assimilate you before you had a grip on your splits.

                   A psycho would attack, slander, spread lies, and make false accusations about Jenny Moore, and betray her exactly as Judas betrayed Jesus Christ.

                  <p>
                   A psycho would call for backup and organize a complete disinformation campaign to target, threaten and attack any others who stood up for Jenny Moore and The Truth.

                  <p>
                   A psycho would mock Jesus Christ, call Good People despicable names, and send grotesque cupcakes as a sick joke after they were exposed as corrupt.

                  <p>
                   A psycho's glorified assistant would show up after their army of corruption and ignorance was defeated and exposed to repeat broken childish insults out of anger, desperation and embarrassing defeat when the rest went silent with shame and cowardice.

                   Jenny Moore is not the only one who was slandered, attacked, doxxed, threatened, tortured and murdered for The Truth.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   We know why none of you can answer the questions. We know why you are attacking with ignorant rage, and are unable to even address The Truth. We know how empty you feel inside when you forsake Jesus Christ. It is still not too late to stop being Evil and stupid. Just being stupid is Evil enough.

               To everyone else watching:  See what she just did?  She took completely irrelevant comments made by me, and threw them out here in an attempt to force a fight-or-flight response in me to defend myself.
              </p>
              <p>
               This detracts from her nefarious intentions, redirects the spotlight from her actions to mine.

               It's classic psychological manipulation.  She's just not really good at it.

            I think the Jem situation was probably a flash in the pan and a weird anomaly that will disappear on its own you guys will stop calling attention to it.

           <hr/>
           <p>
            I also think the flairing is a bad idea. It is a very slippery slope and it could devolve into mods flairing posters just because they think a poster is obnoxious. That is a privilege no mod should have in a supposed free speech zone.
           </p>
           <hr/>
           <p>
            It will also create division between posters and mods. Mods will be seen as "special" people and
            <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/v/pizzagate">
             v/pizzagate
            </a>
            will probably gain the reputation of being a place with gatekeeping mods. People will be afraid to truly speak their mind.
           </p>
           <hr/>
           <p>
            Making threads like this also feeds the trolls. They probably feel like they are winning and getting under your skin. If you start flairing people I think it might lead to a never ending situation of the same trolls testing the mods with new alts.

            Sarah has been here a long time and will probably always be here. Instead of engaging it, which is what the trolls want, I would ignore it.

             These are all valid points, ES. But how would you recommend dealing with users who take advantage of Voat's "Comments are Sacred" prime directive to regularly lie and deceive other users for the purposes of damaging the forum? This is one of the few tools Voat provides to deal with that.
            </p>
            <p>
             Ten months ago, when Jem's false claims and manipulation stirred so many people up, I addressed the disinfo directly and politely. No one remembered that, however, in Voat's labyrinthine, ever-moving maze of comments and replies. All it took was one tweet by George Webb to throw this subverse into chaos for going on three weeks now.
            </p>
            <p>
             The mod team has worked very, very hard to run this sub the way most users want, so that their hard work and research are not suppressed or subverted by forum sliding shills. We are not at all interested in creating a chilled atmosphere where people are afraid to speak, and have taken a strong position when we see that happening (as you know). There is absolutely no reason a person who respects other users and the community mission would ever GET a flair.
            </p>

            <p>
             We have had this "privilege" all along, ES, and we have never once used it, let alone abused it. If a mod were to abuse it, it would give you ample ammo to appeal to Voat at large and have them removed. In that sense, it actually exposes mods to MORE oversight.
            </p>
            <p>
             You can certainly make the argument that this might chill people's ability to just sling shit whenever they feel like it, which is a time-honored tradition on Voat at large. But this isn't Voat at large. It's a focused sub with a pointed mission that a small army with unlimited funding is paid to disrupt. People have the entire rest of Voat to vent their spleen, and username flairs earned here don't show outside of this sub.
            </p>
            <p>
             On the other hand, allowing people to get off scott free for making baseless accusations against other users and mods DOES have a chilling effect on speech. You succeeded in driving the vast majority of those interested in researching Q to a whole different subverse in this manner.

              The Q Larp becomes more ridiculous every week. A TON of people don't believe it is real. I spoke my mind on the subject. Q is an anonymous source that contributes nothing and as far as pizzagate goes, the Q larper just rehashes OUR research once in a while. This sub is for pizzagate, not a laboratory to examine anonymous larpers.

               Jem told everyone I doxed her IP address and sent thugs to beat her up in her house, Esoteric. Just exactly what does that have to do with me "understaning occult knowledge" or not? I don't need initiation into gnostic mysteries to discern that kind of concern trolling bullshit. You can't just wave away her baseless claims with more baseless claims that a privileged few have special insight. At least not on

                That is bullshit and we all know it. You would never harm another Voat user and I know that. You never doxed anybody and you didn't dox Jem. Mods can't even see IP addresses. You have never done that and you never would in my opinion. Jem got banned because Jem could not follow the posting rules. I watched it all in real time. Jem got banned because of Jem. Jem understood the posting rules and refused to comply to those rules. I do not hold you, Vindicator, responsible for that. Jem did that to herself. I know that.

I tried to tell you one time that in an occult sense that "sarah" means "the mother of the Jews" but you just was not having it. If you don't believe me just look it up dude.

But there has been usernames that look like other peoples, one guy was trying to invite me to a lets be a satanist mason video, selling the devii is misunderstood bollocks. These shills will really try to fuck with you.

            I suuport the idea of a shill marker. There's certain obnoxious people on this board who deserve it.
           </p>
           <p>
            Is it possible she just completely snapped/lost it during the Jem incident? IE the Jem
incident is the root cause.
           </p>
           <p>
            Alternatively, the incident could be a trigger for a "true face
mode". However, I believe this is a less likely explanation than above.
           </p>
           <p>
            Noticed that this behaviour was sudden, dated around the incident.
           </p>
           <p>
            Just speaking my observations. Staying neutral on this.

             Well, that's entirely possible.
            </p>
            <p>
             I'd say it's more likely she was activated, given her submissions being wordsalad, and there being EXACTLY 911 in
             <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/v/PizzagateNoMod">
              /v/PizzagateNoMod
             </a>
             , her accusations of actual crimes, threats of police, and the usernames that
             <em>
              still
             </em>
             seem to support her constantly, and have not called her out or asked her WTF is wrong with her, I'm of the mind that my conclusion is more likely by a long shot.

              I think I might have a way to either prove or disprove my theory (which would validate yours).
             </p>
             <p>
              Theory: If we look at her PRE July 2018 submissions (all of them), we can attempt to date any signs of decaying quality or the exact date of the change.
             </p>
             <p>
              If there were a decent number of good submissions Pre July 2018, then its plausible that she went insane after the Jem Incident.
             </p>
             <p>
              Just offering my thoughts on this and a way to find the truth.
             </p>
             <p>
              Now then, I think I found something BIG to a case I've in looking into for the past few months. I'll be sure to ping you when its ready.

            Well laid out! I too noticed that Gothamgirl was very non confrontational for a very long time, and then
            <em>

            she just went completely out of her previous character. Very strange for sure!

            "That nothing whatsoever came of. It's the kind of thing I would do if I was doing something bad and had unlimited funds to send people out posting crazy shit that kinda looked like it might be a lead in order to keep the 'investigation' going in perpetuity."

           <p>
            I agree,
This is exactly what this is. Unless it's someone who isn't very smart trying to LARP and has emotional/mental issues. But why would they waste so much time if they didn't have an agenda? There seems to have been quite a few people on here who's point is to mislead, throughout time. At first it was people saying how stupid pizzagate is and that people are idiots for investigating it, then came the weird posts that tied stuff back to the picture of the hand or stuff about reptilians ect. Now it just seems to be people that kind of seem legitimate but also spread disinformation or false leads. Idk just a thought..

            </p>
            <p>
             Why did Mods call

             Why did the mods accuse multiple people of being "Sarah"?

             Why did the mods accuse others of being advanced bots?

             The Truth is Unmistakable.

             <strong>
              We knew Jenny Moore directly. We know more than ALL OF YOU COMBINED.

            </p>
            <p>
             We have also received threats, including from the mods and others.
            </p>
            <p>
             Jenny is not the only one who was threatened, slandered, doxxed, attacked and murdered.
            </p>
            <p>
             Why can't anyone here answer the questions posed over recent weeks?

            </p>
            <p>
             Do any of you know the answers to these questions or any of the others posed to you?

            <p>
             Are you still going to argue that Jenny is still alive?

             Are you still going to argue that Jenny is a CIA disinformation agent?
            </p>
            <p>
             Are you still going to argue that Jenny was not murdered?

            <blockquote>
             <p>
              We ask questions to find out who really wants to know The Truth.
             </p>
             <p>
              We ask questions to find out who actually knows The Truth, and who pretends to.

              We asked Jenny Moore many questions directly.

             <p>
              She answered them honestly, and some she did not know, but did not pretend to either.
             </p>
             <p>
              In basic terms, she found The Truth, and she gave her life for The Truth.
             </p>

              Why are those who Betrayed Jenny Moore so desperately afraid of The Truth that Jenny knew?
             </p>
             <p>
              Why did the hit piece created by those who Betrayed her garner over 750 comments? What were they ones they were most worried about hiding?

             <p>
              Why are so many including all of the mods here ganging up to attack and slander Jenny Moore and call her names that no one should ever be called? Why are they lying, attacking, downvoting, calling for backup, slandering and threatening any who stand up for Jenny Moore and The Truth? Why was a special tag created by corrupt mods to falsely label those who defended Jenny Moore as disinfo agents? What were the mods accused of by those they falsely labeled?
             </p>
             <p>
              Why were the mods spreading lies, falsely accusing users of being other people, and portraying themselves as victims?
             </p>
             <p>
              Why was Jenny Moore not the only one who was threatened, doxxed, attacked and murdered for The Truth?
             </p>
             <p>
              What did Jenny think of Defango, Unirock, Lift the Veil, Jason Goodman, Trish Negron, and George Sweigart and some of the other characters involved?
             </p>
             <p>
              What did Jenny know that none of them knew? What did Jenny believe that none of them believed?
             </p>
             <p>
              What was Jenny's focus? Who did she meet with? What was her end game?

              Who were George's exes, employers, and deep contacts?
             </p>
             <p>
              What did she say about the Clintons? What did she say about Donald Trump? What did she say about Agenda 21 and Sustainability?
             </p>
             <p>
              What did she say about 5G artificial intelligence, and how it connects to child trafficking, corruption, abuse and tyranny?
             </p>
             <p>
              What did she say about Paul Ryan, John McCain, Anthony Weiner, Chuck Schumer, Podestas, Emanuels, Ashton Kutcher and some of the others intimately involved?
             </p>
             <p>
              What did she know about secret societies, corruption, blackmail, public-private partnerships, and fake religions?
             </p>
             <p>
              Why is SoberSecondThought so interested?
             </p>
             <p>
              What does he know about Lies, Threats, Murder?

              Q has told you some Truth, but so have Defango, George Sweigart, and others.
             </p>
             <p>
              When will ANY OF THEM finally reveal The REAL Truth?

              I've barely had any major interactions with GothamGirl to make a comment on anything about her or if she likes to bed married men or even if FlynnL1ve5 is in the middle of a divorce and looking for a night cap. 
The entire thing seems wierd as fuck to me that this is even in this sub. Although, this has given me the idea to start a dating site for Q believers. It would be a great way to avoid dating libs...

                I'm not taking a side in this. Simply engaging with any of this drama is a distraction. When Jem bought the farm, I stated that I wasn't believing any of it and moved on, which is what everyone needs to do regarding drama. It's not worth wasting the time and energy on. Distractions slow down research.

                 Kind of pertinent to the mods who have to deal with Sarah's alts constantly.  It's nice you get this safe little bubble where you feel you can be such a pacifist, but it's pretty rude to tell those doing the work behind the scenes to allow such a thing that they should just move on.

                <p>
                 If it were simply "drama", I would not be in on it.  It's a coordinated effort between multiple accounts, some very well liked, some aged well, and some as personalities outside of Voat.

                 False leads and character assassinations and vectors of attacks on the mods that suggest to all kinds of people out there that "the pizzagate mods on voat caused the death of a researcher" and "one of the PG mods put CP on some poor girl's phone!" tend to do the same.  Many here believing such stupid things, too, apparently.  You think that doesn't slow the progress on the research?

                 Must be nice to not have to worry about a mod here, the one with the most experience modding here, and one of the most knowledgeable users here, getting accused of being responsible for the supposed death.  In a way that makes it look like legitimate accusations leveled against him due to manufactured consensus.

                 You've got some good perspectives on some things, and I thank you for your input, but you're not in a position to need to consider more.

                   Revealing?  It's not like it's some big secret.  I don't know her intent here, and your bringing this up is highly suspicious.  Why is any of this relevant?

                   Screenshots?  Verbatim quotes?  Anything but you claiming she wrote something and ensuring that everyone thinks that either you're interpreting her words however you want, or that you're telling stories?

                   I know you won't.  There's either no need, and thus a happy Sesame Street-level black-and-white view on the subject is the efficient way forward, or there is another, more sinister reason for you not to.

                   I don't really want to think the latter, but your response here throws up quite a few red flags.

                    I just went to take a screenshot of her comment about her being a PG mod, and suddenly the PM she sent me is gone. How exactly does that happen? It happened, she said it, why is it now missing from my Inbox?
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    If you go back and read her comments in the thread we're on now, you can see she states:
                    <em>
                     I’ve been here since the beginning when pizzagate broke. All this time, I’ve worked and shown I have credibility. I have these people trying to tarnish my name, apply “pizzagate mod” to it.
                    </em>
                    Do you want a mod on a board who's obviously embarrassed of her title? How great can a mod be when they seem to see it as a negative?
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    When she told me she was a PG mod on Aug. 3rd, I did go to
                    <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/v/Pizzagate">
                     v/Pizzagate
                    </a>
                    and she wasn't listed as a mod, but I see that now she is. What is the deal with this, and why did she get all bent out of shape about being called a Pizzagate mod? I don't understand the reasoning for her feeling embarrassed or called out.
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    Now that I see she pulled the same kind of "Shh, don't tell" tactic with GothamGirl, I'm suspicious, too.
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    I'm also suspicious because it's easy to see from this thread that srayzie automatically takes offense if you don't side with her. I was trying to be as unbiased as possible until she started replying to me with this air of authority acting as though I had done something horribly wrong, then saying I'm not the same person she remembers speaking to? What? My "voice" doesn't change on here. I have no alts.
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    You can go ahead and see all the red flags you want with me, but I wouldn't want someone as a mod who is overly sensitive and expects everyone to agree with her, and seeks out and/or creates drama.
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    Here she is trying to stir up more drama by posting a thread titled "This mod sucks!"

                   <p>
                    I'm here to do research. Trolls have always been a variable of "conspiracy theory" boards. It's always going to be that way. If people can't identify them on their own, that's their problem. Sure, trolls are here to play mind games and spread disinfo, so if you want to start labeling people you truly believe are trolls, or one's like me you determine are going against the grain, I have to wonder how many members are going to have their good reputations tarnished under the guise that you're trying to help people know who the trolls are.

                    If you see red flags with me except for what you're perceiving in this thread, bring it on.

                     regarding my defending myself when someone was spreading complete lies about me, apparently doesn’t apply to you. What a hypocrite.

                     </strong>
                     I became a pizzagate mod, I was threatened by a user who said
                     <a href="https://images2.imgbox.com/51/fc/3DSNBapn_o.jpeg">
                      he would pay to have my son raped.
                     </a>
                     That user, who I won’t ping, has a history of showing he’s dangerous. Simply using his username, you can search the Internet and see that he’s dangerous and has been for years.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     He started going on Gab, discord, 8chan, and on podcasts accusing me and Vindicator of all kinds of sick pedophilia type things. Pizzagate mods are often targeted. Especially Vindicator. I’m not just some drama queen that makes all this shit up. This isn’t fun to me. I’m sick of all this, and want to focus on Q! I’ve proved myself with Sara, Jem, and now GothamGirl. I’ll prove myself again. Then you can back the fuck off.

                      How did he know you had a son? Are you telling me you're that stupid to have actually mentioned you have a son knowing the trolls who are on this board? You know, nobody can attack something if they don't know it exists. It's as though you're dangling bait for them. While I'm not defending his threat... Tsk, tsk on you, Mom. smh

Seriously, I'm surprised to discover that you even have a kid because I thought you were a lesbian considering the way you're always calling another daily contributer "doll face" and praising women on their "vagina power" Ex. here in this "shitpost" you created with your friends. How often do you all go out and have a beer together?

                      Why are you so obsessed with who's a man and who's a woman on here? That PM you sent me asking about my gender is gone, too, just like the one where you told me you were a secret PG mod. Why wasn't your name listed in the PG mod list at the beginning on August? By the way, only the bottom dwelling trolls think they're smart by acting all buddy-buddy and immediately slide into asking ID (gender, age, location) questions on an anon board and expect members to tell them the truth. If they're paying you to pigeon hole anons, they're wasting their money.

                       About your gender, I told you that I suspected you were a female because you were sweet but tried to act toughpublivly and I was right.

                       You’re a fricken stalker now trying to make me look bad and every time you are making yourself look even more like an immature deceptive cunt. Just leave me alone.

                        Thanks for admitting that you asked me my gender, so why can't I find that PM? It's gone just like the one where you asked me not to reveal that you were a PG mod. How do the PMs disappear?

                          I think you've got issues, too. You won't even answer my questions about your son. And, yes, I think that anybody on here should not be posting about their kids. Just like I think people shouldn't be posting their kids' pics on FB. It's just beyond stupid.

                           I don’t post my kids pics anywhere. No I don’t act the same way in front of my son. On Voat, I can let my hair down. I don’t have to be proper or politically correct. I don’t even curse in front of my husband. What I do outside of pizzagate and GA is my business. My sense of humor is my business.

                            You have no sense of humor, and it's not funny the way you go around calling authentic researchers cunts and bitches, then can't handle the heat when one calls you out. You're pathetic. You never even provide any useful original research. All your posts are of stuff that's been presented whether it's Q posts or news you've seen.

                             I never said that part was funny. Some of the things I’ve posted have been presented, some I have researched on my own. Who cares? We all do our part. I’m here because I care about kids and my country. That doesn’t mean that I have to put up with CUNTS like you. That doesn’t mean I can’t go to other subs, use my right to free speech and play with my online friends all I want.

                              If you're calling people cunts you better have a damn good reason for it, or you need to shut the fuck up when they start to retaliate instead of acting like a huge cry baby.

                               Me the cry baby? Lol. I replied about everything needed to prove you wrong. The serious stuff has been dealt with. I’m a big girl. If you want to go have a tantrum now because I called you a cunt, then my sense of humor may just come out. Just a little heads up. This is my specialty. I’m the nicest person you could meet until I’m not. I will have a blast laughing at you and watching you unravel.

                                Really? I don't think you have answered all of my questions. You're not a big girl to my standards and I'm a damn nice person. I don't go around throwing the words 'cunt' and 'shill' around like you and the other mods. Hive mind mentality at the finest. You like to act as though you're so wonderful with the ultimate judgement skills, but you fail miserably.

                       I didn’t tell him I had a son. Many people here admit to having kids. At least half of the people on the pizzagate sub are people with kids. I don’t provide details cunt. You don’t know how to admit you’re wrong.

                           Because Gothamgirl was accusing me of planting child porn in her phone and threatening to kidnap her kid when I had never met her. Vindicator was being blamed for shit because Jem died and she had spread lies saying pizzagate mods were conspiring against her. Jem and GothamGirl are connected. Sarah started tweeting death threats to me, which I archived and made a post about. She made posts giving death threats to mods on Voat. She started tweeting shut out about the pizzagate mods. All at the same time that GothamGirl comes after me, another mod. We have been under attacked.

                            Wasting your entire day away? LOL! I haven't even been on the boards all day.

                            All I see is word salad with what you've presented. I didn't ask you to rehash what's happened to you and why you're so bent out of shape. I asked how he knew you had a son and you won't answer this. Do you have a son? If so, why did you feel the need to bring him up anywhere online?

                             I rehashed to prove you wrong. To show that you twisted everything. I succeeded. That’s why you’re stooping somlow now. Every time I refresh, it’s a notification  because of your drama. Go to bed old lady.

                              won't listen to reason. I want to stroke his ego by demanding a SHILL flair, but he won't comply. Is he scared? Is he afraid of questions? I just don't understand. He seems to want to flair people, but he seems so confused because he throws the word 'shill' around like you throw the word 'cunt' around. What's wrong with you people? I mean this seriously.

Are you too stupid to realize that my submission points being greater than my comment points actually helps my credibility? No, of course not. No to worry though. I'll keep mentioning at the bottom of all my research threads that you think I'm a shill. Should work out well for you.

                               Bitch, I answered your questions and you aren’t my judge. I don’t owe you shit. I’ve been nice enough to do that. But, I’m done now. You’re pathetic and petty. Move on.

                                    No problem. All you have to do is read this thread to see how it started, then when went sideways. I think srayzie got upset because I didn't slam GothamGirl and tried to stay neutral until she started going on and on and on about death threats and how everyone's out to get her. I tried to be nice and explain my reasoning, but then she got nasty with me. People who insist on having things their way and pushing people around need to remember that sometimes people push back, so if you're going to dish it out, you best be able to take it. I still want to know how those PMs disappeared from my inbox.

                                  Gee, I feel the same way! I'm talking to some bitch that is twisting everything I've said AND trying to get her buddy-bud mods to back her. You're a cunt of the highest order. A narcissist. A sociopath. You're unbalanced as fuck. Voat is some sort of fucked up popularity contest to you. I guess you're trying to make up for being the invisible girl in high school.

                                       can speak for himself. But, I think if you were to look thru this profile like you stalked mine, you would see he, probably more than anyone I know on Voat, doesn’t give a damn what ANYONE thinks of him.

You're the last person who has the poor capability of judging anyone. Get ready to defend yourself at every turn. Every time I present my research, I'm going to mention that you think I'm a shill until nobody trusts you or srayzie. You asked for it. I'm delivering.

                                Where did you answer my questions? I asked you how he knew you had a son, and all I saw was you saying that everyone mentions when they're a parent on here. Not that I've seen. Anyone who mentions they have kids on here are asking for trouble. You certainly wouldn't get my vote for Mom of the Year.

                                 I didn’t tell him I had a son. Since he doxes, and knew someone that I had previously been friends with, I thought he knew. TONS of people admit to be a parent here. He could be grown up for all you know. I wouldn’t want you involved in any vote lol. You get nasty when you get embarrassed and are proven wrong.

                                  When have I been proven wrong? How did he dox you? Are you saying that that photo of you on your Twatter account isn't really you? You act like others stating they have kids makes it OK for you to discuss yours. Yeah, OK. Like the age old saying goes, if your friends jump off a bridge, should you? You're an idiot.

                                    OK, you said he "might have." Where is your evidence? Besides, getting all bent out of shape when he says he's going to rape your son when you don't have one (right?) seems very dramatic. You're obviously drawn to drama. You above anyone else I've seen on the boards cries the most about being hounded and stalked by people. I think you invite it and like it. Not a mod quality if you ask me. You've got thin skin.

                      I just went to take a screenshot of her comment about her being a PG mod, and suddenly the PM she sent me is gone. How exactly does that happen? It happened, she said it, why is it now missing from my Inbox?

All this time, I’ve worked and shown I have credibility. I have these people trying to tarnish my name, apply “pizzagate mod” to it.

I was trying to be as unbiased as possible until she started replying to me with this air of authority acting as though I had done something horribly wrong, then saying I'm not the same person she remembers speaking to? What? My "voice" doesn't change on here. I have no alts.

                     Srayzie is extremely knowledgeable on PG and Q, and archives everything like an driven-mad autist.  She might not be the best at explaining things, but if she hadn't made her posts about Jem and Sarah, I wouldn't really know much about them, and would not be able to see the patterns between them and their many, many alts.  I don't mind taking all the info she has and paring it down for a submission about a username that very clearly has a link to the above disinfo shills.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     Add to that that she's one of the few users to have made a successful subverse through their own hard work, and dedication, and I think I can safely say I'm not the only one here happy to have her on our team.  She's driven to do what's right, even if it makes her look exactly as you say to some.  As I mentioned before, you have not been around enough of this, and you agreed; now you're making a value-judgment on my mods?  Square that circle for me.

                       Just that one little string pulled on and you unravel like this?  It never ceases to amaze me how quickly you paid fucks lose your cool when caught.

                        I thought the whole point of you wanting to flair shills is to prevent members from believing and trusting your work. Now, we have you, a trusted and distinguished mod encouraging trolls to present their research?

                                 Actually, we get this all the time -- jew bashing threads that use Jewish-sounding sophistry. There's a whole contingent of fake anti-semite shills. I don't know if they post their crap to make Voaters look like alt-right extremists, or to chum up to the many on Voat who are not fans of Jews.

                                   You missed my point. You said "Why would I be creating a thread against Israel if I were Jewish." I said it's a tactic we see used frequently by accounts that are probably JIDF so creating a thread against Israel doesn't prove you're not a Jew. I was pointing out the error in your argument, not stating an opinion about your ethnic or religious background.

                 I had no choice. I’m the one having these people coming after me. I’ve said from the beginning that there is more to the story. It’s really easy for someone else to say move on because it’s a distraction. This little group is even making death threats. I’m accused of crimes that I’ve proved are false. I’ve been told several times that she’s calling the police. Why you would think that’s no big deal surprises me.

                 I’ve been here since the beginning when pizzagate broke. All this time, I’ve worked and shown I have credibility. I have these people trying to tarnish my name, apply  “pizzagate mod”  to it. Then screenshots and lies are being made about pizzagate mod and put out on Twitter from Sarah alts. But, I should just get over it? WE should get over it? Allow it to continue? Don’t address it?
                </p>
                <p>
                 Whether Crensch seems like an asshole or not, there’s proof that these are lies and I even have more. This isn’t about Crensch. He’s had 2 mods being attacked recently. A coordinated effort is trying to cause division. That’s just drama?

                 Me and you have always got along from what I remember. Even recently. If you don’t want to take sides or be bugged by this drama, then why even put yourself in the middle of it like you just did. It’s acceptable to you to have people that are posting false accusations and threats? I’m just surprised seeing your name here.

                   This little group is even making death threats. I’m accused of crimes that I’ve proved are false. I’ve been told several times that she’s calling the police. Why you would think that’s no big deal surprises me.

                  I personally wouldn't worry about it. Just recently I had something very strange happen to me online that appeared to come from Voat and cross over into Facebook. Sure, I was worried at first, but I didn't get all paranoid and start accusing any of the members who were attacking me on the voat thread of trying to intimate me on Facebook. After a while had passed, I asked a particular member if he had any idea how something like that could've happened, chatted about it, and that's the end of it. Nothing has happened since.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  I don't understand what the big deal is with them referring to you as a "Pizzagate mod". So what?
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  Why do you keep wanting to offer up more evidence of your innocence when I haven't even see any proof offered up by GothamGirl of your guilt. Scenario: If a business accuses a person of stealing from them, should the accused automatically dump their purse and pockets on the table, or calmly ask why they believe they stole something and what proof they have that it was you?

                  "Bought the farm" is a figure of speech meaning that the person died.

                   It’s not even worth explaining it. You can’t put yourself in my shoes for even a minute. A little bit of good news...  Well, after a week of all this and having people I’ve known here for over a year turn on me, she did the right thing today.

                    Don't worry. I won't ask you to apologize for basicly calling me a sociopath. After all, that's what they can't do is put themselves in someone else's shoes, and I do that better than most people. But, how would you or anyone know that? Nobody really knows anyone here, do they?

                      What does that have to do with anything? I'm pretty indifferent to everyone here.

                      Considering how old you look in your photo, I can bet that I was contributing to conspiracy boards while you were still in high school. I've learned to keep my distance and do my best to not get emotional. Why are you acting as though I'm doing something wrong.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                      I don't seem like I like someone? What exactly do you mean? Yeah, I'm not going to hand out hugs and pats on the back. This isn't a therapy session. It's a conspiracy/truth/debate board. If somebody has something significant to say, I'll throw them a bone. What more should I do? Ask them what their address is, so I can include them in my Christmas card list?
                     </p>
                     <p>
                      You know, I'm backing off. I just submitted my last thread to your GA board. After all, it's not as if you ever contribute to my threads anyway, so no big deal. I do my best to spread truth whether or not it's appreciated. I have to step away when a hive mentality appears to be taking over. Best of luck to you.

                       For someone who commented on this thread who says they don’t want the drama and to move on, I’m surprised you’re still going on about this. I’ve never asked you for a thing. I’ve never leaned on you for any emotional support. From what I remember, you were always cool. I think we even talked privately a few times and thought you were a joy. I see a lot of new people on GA. Maybe I’m thinking of someone else.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                       It doesn’t matter what kind of board this is. I’ve gone thru hell ever since I met this Sarah thing. I’ve had my family threatened and myself. Then it escalated big time in the last week. You saw a small little piece of the big picture. Your great advice is “ignore it”. You could have moved on and not commented. You put yourself here.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                       You may have been on this earth longer than me, but you aren’t willing or capable of seeing past usernames and words on the screen, and grasping that we’re all human beings here. You lack in the human decency department. You’re cold, you’re sarcastic, and you’re bitter.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                       Well that’s ok with me that you are leaving GA. People come and go. Since you try so hard to keep your distance and not get emotional, I’m sure that I wouldn’t have noticed anyway. Good luck.

                        I said I'm stepping back. I tried to inject some rationalization into this drama, but you're obviously hell bent on getting everyone on your side or they're on your shit list, so I'd rather bow out than play that game. Take my word for it, there's a HUGE difference between what's said on an Anonymous board and what happens in real life. You've gone through hell because an anonl threatened you? I've been there and have had to call the cops for a real cyber threat, which resulted in the guy getting arrested. I don't become emotional simply because someone expects me to. My advice is to choose your battles before you become an army of one.

                Honestly, I don't have any idea. Just ignore them and hope other genuine members catch on? Even IRL, you can warn someone that so and so is a bitch or asshole, but you usually end up looking like the bad guy, and just have to wait for the person you tried to warn to learn the hard way that you were telling the truth and only trying to help them.

                  Yes, they should be ignored. They want you to get all bent out of shape. Why give an enemy what they want? How does reacting do
                  <em>
                   you
                  </em>
                  any good?
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  I try my best to pick my battles, so if some nameless, faceless POS on a website starts accusing me of something and they can't even offer one shred of proof, why worry about it? Sociopaths are attracted to those they know will engage, but if you feel as though you absolutely must reply to them, don't do it right away. Go for a walk, take a shower, do anything to make sure you aren't emotional in your reply. Think of GothamGirl as a psychic vampire. Do you really want to feed her?

                 Forums have their downsides, but easily proving your claims is not one of them.  Anytime someone thinks you're the asshole, "Sure, maybe so, here's the link to my evidence, so feel free to prove me wrong!" AAAAND that's all she wrote.

                   Yep, and they'll be easier to deal with if nobody speaks up on my sticky.  Any aged accounts with low contributions or new accounts that post shit against the mods can get a nice pretty flair as being a likely troll/shill army grunt.

This is still a free speech zone and leaders should be able to be questioned and criticized in a mature manner and respond in kind. Unless of course someone is being especially abusive for no good reason.

                     I am ALL FOR legitimate criticisms of mods and other users.  By all means, bring it on.  It's this GG-tier shit that I am beyond sick of already, because it's nothing but wild accusations and manufactured consensus by sock-puppet accounts, both new and aged.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     There's a reason I'm in the center of this shitstorm, and it's because I do not do the day-to-day modding.  In fact, if things are going well, I stay away as much as possible to avoid bias when and if a legitimate complaint on one of the mods comes up.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     I need to watch my words, thank you very much for calling me out on not being specific enough there in a way that others could use against me.  I hope you don't mind, I'll be editing it.

                      The user I'm responding to has some very good points.  I'd appreciate if y'all would ask any questions of him (or me) that come to mind, because he has a different perspective that has me re-evaluating some things.  Whether or not that'll change anything with my position, I do not know.

                       is different from other subs, people here are more sensitive.

                      <p>
                       I'm afraid labelling some users will deepen the gap between users and mods, and lead to more 'mods are gods' accusations.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                       And while you are the O of this sub, and not modding the daily shifts, the mods are perceived as a team, you included.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                       Personally, I think we can combat shills and trolls without labelling them.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                       Users also accuse each other of all kind of insane stuff, so then we would have to flair these accusers as well?
                      </p>
                      <p>
                       I don't really want to give the impression we mods are privileged, because we can flair the users / bots who attack us, while normal users can't.

                      <p>
                       My two cents.

                        What if users were included in the process to flair? That would mitigate a lot of this. They could make a post in
                        <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/v/pizzagatemods">
                         v/pizzagatemods
                        </a>
                        and request a user be flaired, making the case for why, with evidence. That would also engage folks in the moderation of the sub, which we are always trying to do.
                       </p>
                       <p>
                        The drawback would be making themselves a target for calling out bad citizenship, as happened with

                        when she tried to post what she knew about Jem, and Gothamgirl and the Sarah bots attacked her. Buuuuut that could be dealt with by having users anonymize their submission if they want to.

                        </em>
                        helping fight disinfo disruptors.
                       </p>
                       <p>
                        Also, I think it bears emphasizing that any posts critiquing users to explain a flair would be made in
                        <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/v/pizzagatemods">
                         v/pizzagatemods

I would like users to focus on research and discussions of content, not to be constantly afraid that someone might want to instigate other users against them, or shills taking advantage of the possibility to call out users.

                         I suppose that would work. Sounds like it would keep the playing field level and allow other members to judge for themselves when they reviewed the mod thread. I guess try it and if it doesn't work, scrap it and try something new. Call it the Guinea Pig Troll study #01

               's supposed death brought out the PG long-con shills that propped her up as a martyr like the normies and MSM are doing to McCain right now.  Many of them
               <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/v/whatever/2682573">
                accused Vindicator of being responsible for her death

              </p>
              <p>
               Ever since Jem777's fake death, the mods here have been getting attacked
               <em>
                constantly
               </em>
               .  Srayzie has Gothamgirl, who befriended her long ago and they shared this lie? true? half-true? girly friendship that became the center of an issue involving multiple well-known/liked usernames supporting GG.

               It's unfortunate that understanding these (likely) shills requires an understanding of multiple other usernames and youtube personalities and what crazy things these usernames seem to obsess over.

                I share your frustration, but people are going to have to figure things out for themselves when it comes to whether or not someone's a shill and if they should risk getting closer to someone. More trolls are on the way, so skin them alive, block them, and move on. Alefantis' ex-squeeze, David Brock, just asked for millions of donations to build another troll army. (Sorry I can't link to the story at the moment. Saw it on Drudge earlier today.)
               </p>
               <p>
                Also, the Q dating site is already dead in the water. I don't want to be the one to bring a Q supporter and ShareBlue shill together.
                <em>
                 shudder
                </em>
                Fakery and baiting would abound, and we can see from this thread how easy it is to get close to someone, then fuck them over. Not worth the stress and aggravation.

                 Any Q follower should know that expressing their support or position is a dangerous game.  Like you recommend above, "people are going to have to figure things out for themselves".
                </p>
                <p>
                 Yes.  But the forum sliding disinformation and the reputations some of these users have needs to be addressed.  If nobody can make a case for not flairing Gothamgirl, would it not benefit everyone here to put the flair on her and then everyone can move on?  Then when a user asks, "why?" we can link them here.
                </p>
                <p>
                 So if it's a shill username, they're basically burned and have zero influence here, even with their past posts and comments.

                  I suppose handing out Scarlet Letters will work, and it will help the trolls find their teammates more easily, too. Kind of a Catch 22, you know? Like sending someone to group sex addiction therapy. You know there's going to be a hook up.

            I had asked FlynnL1ve5 on Twitter if he had seen Gothamgirls picture because they liked each other...

           <p>
            Same date. GothamGirl’s screenshot shows that soon after me saying that I was waiting for a response to the picture question, I made the message to her saying don’t tell him I’m sharing this. Clearly, he answered the picture question and I was sharing it. She was excited. I was trying to help her.
           </p>
           <p>
            She’s trying to twist everything to make me look bad.
