Refering to Pizzagate. to the implication of organ harvesting of children and blood and heart transplants. But that can\'t be why because now Ive gone and revisited the thread and I was called a pedophile by somebody before I told someone else they were sucking dick. That seems worse, to me, and a good reason to feel provoked. But actually My last tweet, was clearly about James Alefantis, his being a pedo and his name meaning I love infants in french. Voila account suspended. At least I can get in there and see what what. Speaking of what what...Tidak Apa Apa De. One of My favorite sayings...in bahasa malay, meaning  no big deal, except unlike in the Katy Perry song...I say it to the folks at Twitter who suspend my voice, Tidak Apa Apa de! And Terimakasi which means literally take give or thank you, for allowing me to cover and exemplify your bias regarding Pizzagate, and for demonstrating so well how elites are protecting pedophilia, online and in the world. Talking to these folks started cause I commented; -what Russia!? wheres the outrage about the missing children in the states? Then The barrage of tweets telling me to shut the fuck up came from all sides..then this little spat, and im kicked out. Please dont be afraid to take a look these are just 4 screenshots hosted by imgbb. No weirdo links!!!
