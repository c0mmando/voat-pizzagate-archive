            I agree that this shows that Bannon likes to bang kids as much as Trump. I suspect that Trump is setting up Kushner because he wants to get Ivanka back--even thought she is too old for him. Bannon HATES Kushner, so this all seems to fall into place.

            If Bannon is for real, he has the most curious resume in history.  He started with Goldman Sacks.  From there he opened a private business which he build from scratch and somehow sold to our CNN friend Ted Turner for a fortune. From there he drops out of nowhere into the totally closed society of Hollywood Zionist Jews.  He later gives seminars at the Vatican no less.  Then out of nowhere drops into a plum position at Breitbart after they murdered Andrew. Bannon stinks to high Heaven.  I don't know exactly who he works for.  He's a Georgetown product, so best guess is Jesuits.  Worst guess would be that he's working for the American public. I didn't trust him from day one.

            this is great news if true. whenever I get despondent at news thinking that lefturds are winning I read this. Good analysis folks. Yes, if they had stuff on Bannon they would not have to make up Russian shit. Pedophiles all over the world must be shitting in their silk underwear over this.
IF we manage to take down pedophile rings WE are going to be seen as The Greatest Generation. Our struggle is BIGGER than that during WWII. Hard to believe. But but but History has place you and me here, now. Why? Dunno. But do know that our ancestors cannot fight it for us, nor can our children. So ok then, who is going to have Humanity? Superman? no .... US. You and me.

             Bannon was in investor, but he did that after Westinghouse asked him to sell Castle Rock and really imo, he saved it by his investment.  No he did not direct or produce it, but his investment did make a difference.

             Bannon was an investor in the show's syndication and had NOTHING whatsoever to do with its production.

            Brock Pierce is known as one of the major pedo's in Hollywood. They were all scared of Bannon not only because of his no nonsense political beliefs and patriotism but he was a big time Hollywood investor/producer in the past. He is partly responsible for Seinfeld for those who do not know. He has dirt on everyone.

             Larry David is responsible for Seinfeld.  It is such COMMON KNOWLEDGE that t don't think it necessary to provide a link.  Any quick search online will bring ti up.
            </p>
            <p>
             Bannon had an INVESTMENT in Seinfeld's SYNDICATION.  Ergo, he got in the game at the END, not the beginning.

              I personally considered it clear as day that he was not in a role such as Larry David lmfao...I'm sure I'm not alone in that I was not aware Bannon had any connection in that regard.

             <p>
              Sounding like a media matters "fact check" lol ignoring the actual content and finding specific statements which if taken 100% literal would be considered "incorrect". Most readers clearly wouldn't read such a statement n go oh fuck Bannon was the only person responsible for Seinfeld...

             Did not know about his involvement in Seinfeld at all - thanks for adding this context. Great info OP and Jem - hoping we are correct in our presumption that he is woke and working hard in the background against these sadistic fucks.

             yep I mean theres other reasons to think this but this is a prettt clear connection. in fact that movie about pierce mark and chad an open secret is a pretty big part of things as they were huge players in the Hollywood pedo connection
