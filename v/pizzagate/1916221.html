            Hillary will be suicided before she can squeal on any of her friends. She has already outlived her usefulness to the Cabal now she is just an annoying harridan who keeps blaming everyone else for her loss to Trump. The power players at the top have had enough of her and I think she will be gone very soon with a big state funeral and all her secrets will then be buried with her. Podesta could be prosecuted but it will be for something that normies can understand like income tax evasion or money laundering or bribery something they can easily convict him for without exposing the pedo-network. They got Al Capone on income tax evasion and it's an easy way to put a bad guy behind bars.

            This may be an unpopular observation, but I don't think there is a single person, anywhere, who actually knows the full scope of what is going on. Not FBIAnon, not George Webb, not Steve Pieczenik, not Comey, not even Podesta or Hillary. I also don't think there is anyone who can make a comprehensive deal. You can't give a grant of immunity to literally thousands of people, most of whom you don't even have names for, who belong to dozens of competing criminal enterprises.

            Notice how the Democrats use all kinds of random people in their various "ratlines," including Bob Creamer, MS-13 gangsters, Pakistani ex-ISI spooks, and on and on. That was just as true 24 years ago, when the FBI was shown to have harassed witnesses in the Vince Foster case. They used Park Police, people from their technical offices, freelance consultants, and so on, and it was clear that many of them had no idea why they were targeting these particular witnesses or even what case they were witnesses in. See
            <a href="http://www.fbicover-up.com/">
             Patrick Knowlton's website
            </a>
            for more on this.
           </p>
           <p>
            The sheer number of interested parties in the pay-to-play mess ALONE boggles the mind. The Clintons have been extorting bribes out of people for decades: The Chinese, the Russians, the Saudis, the Pakistanis, literally everywhere on Earth where there is money and power. And the same goes for John McCain, the Bush family, Chuck Schumer, and so on.
           </p>
           <p>
            I think there probably are people having behind-the-scenes conversations of the type Hodges describes, trying to get their arms around it. I hope there are, anyway. It would be a positive sign. But this mess looks to be beyond the capacity of even its key participants to comprehend, much less negotiate. I've said before, the people we are hunting are not friends or even reliable allies. There is no monolithic "They," in the sense of a bunch of people working toward the same end, directed by a central intelligence, with a common interest above and beyond their various corrupt or demented agendas.
           </p>
           <p>
            I may be in a small minority here, but I don't see this as a conspiracy of Globalists, or Satanists, or Freemasons, or anything that you could describe with a single name. It's less of a coherent conspiracy than it is an insanely bloated kind of opportunistic corruption. Who "really" runs American foreign policy? Despite the huge bribes they pay, it isn't the Saudis or any of the Clinton Foundation's other clients. It wasn't Obama. It isn't Dick Cheney and his corporate pals.
           </p>
           <p>
            Nobody is in charge. Nobody CAN be in charge. That's how I see it, anyway.

                Im sure you offer the same benefit of the doubt to muslim terrorists, who kill far more Muslims than non.  Jews act collectively and benefit collectively and thats why theyve always been "persecuted" (punished collectively).  Both are totally natural and expected behaviors, which is why humans werent meant to mix.

             , so you're thinking is that the Pedogate is to deflect from pizzagate. Others have said this too and it finally dawned on me the reason why. It's because it's better to admit to pedophilia than what pizzagate entails, which is the butchering of kids Lucierian style. Makes sense now. Am I right?

              Some people are too embarrassed to say the word pizzagate. It makes them feel uncomfortable. We have barely begun to investigate pizzagate because of the way it has been defined as "Hillary Clinton running a child trafficking ring out of a DC pizza parlour." That is only the tip of the iceberg.
             </p>
             <p>
              It's a fact of life that we're going to have to fight through thickets of people, who are too prudish to address the crisis that our civilization faces. This is the sexualization of children and the normalization of prostituting them at the mildest end of the spectrum, and the torture, murder and using that for the purposes of sexual gratification, blackmail and power at the worst end of the spectrum.
             </p>
             <p>
              I don't like describing rich and powerful people as "elite," but pizzagate is also people who think they are elite, trying to destroy those who they think are not elite, and they have been using the intelligence agencies, social media, Hollywood and corporations to trap people (brownstoning) in child sex scandals. We are up against a monumental force, and that is Satan.

            This is YUGE if true. Also, this is what he says about Debbie Wasserman Shultz

           <blockquote>
            <p>
             One final note, Wasserman-Schultz, according to my FBI source, better have lots of body guards because in trying to distance herself from the related Seth Rich murder, she is bringing the same kind of attention that the Deep State is trying so hard to avoid.

            They will blame her for everything. They will say she lied about russia, rigged the primaries, murdered seth rich over the primaries, and did all shorts of shennigans.
           </p>
           <p>
            The republicans will say "we told you so!!" and the democrats can still exist. They will put bernie sanders and other establishment pawns back up front, and everyone will be focused on "moving on" and "rebuilding".
           </p>
           <p>
            Hell, they will even say she held obama back.
           </p>
           <p>
            They will blame  the clintons for everything, and while everyone is focoused on that scandal, they will either move or neutralize anyone that would spill the beans about the pedo stuff.
           </p>
           <p>
            This is their nuclear option. They do not want that DNC fraud suit or these citizen investigations to continue. They are freaking out. 
They knew the Internet disrupted business, but they never thought about it disrupting politics.

            They could probably get her on a lot of things ... especially now that that feds raided the home of  Huma's relatives. Got to be lots of tender felony morsels in those cardboard boxes they remove. But, really, ONLY a high ranking Cannibal Elite charged with a Peo crime is going to satisfy us. It'll prove that this is not a conspiracy; it will demonstrate that this is going on in the upper echelon of government; and it will stop the nonsense of Russian hacking for the purpose of sabotaging the election. Here's a prediction of my own: IF this is true, the only way Killary would be offered up as the sacrificial lamb is if she were ill. Without that, no way The Cannibal Queen is going down.

              Oh, they wouldn't believe it. As long as it was something not related to child molestation, they'd think it was an out-of-control Trump being nasty and hurting their poor Killary. The only thing that would do it is IF she were charged with the crime of human trafficking/child molestation, and IF the evidence presented was actual film or pictures of her committing such acts -- and this is a hypothetical situation because, as of now, there is no such evidence that we know about. Even if this is speculation, we really do have to be careful about such allegations. Oh, I'll add in organ harvesting. IF she were accused and convicted of that, and IF the evidence were compelling, than that would taint and cause that rabid bunch of libbies that have lost their mind to do a 180. Again, there is no evidence that she was involved in organ harvesting.
             </p>
             <p>
              I would think the DNC being tied to Seth Rich's murder would be another avenue to go down. I do think that would also tarnish the DNC and whoever was involved -- but there is no evidence or proof that anyone in the DNC is involved.

            This is exactly what I think is happening. And Hillary won't squeal after getting nailed because they have all the child murder and trafficking dirt on her (and a long list of other things). I'll bet she only ends up with a slap on the wrist instead of jail time however. But it'll be juicy enough to wipe Pizzagate off the minds of the sheep.

            Seems like a very reasonable hypothesis that Dave proposes and he even names one of his sources, 
Monika Wesolowski. According to this article, she lost custody of her son to CPS under false pretenses:
            <a href="http://www.dcclothesline.com/2014/05/17/illinois-virginia-cps-conspire-steal-sex-traffic-children/">

            </a>
            So will it be a sacrifice of Hillary to charges of 'Pay to Play' in order to cover up the bigger crimes of human trafficking, arms trafficking, drug running, and war mongering to perpetuate these other criminal businesses?

            I think it'll be Hillary first then Podesta and they'll fall like dominoes after that. This entire monolithic fraud is coming down.

            How do I know? Easy. The second Hillary is arrested she'll rat out everyone in the Deep State. She's too smart to allow them to use her as The Fall

             You continue to spread Dr Steves lies about an inteligence agency civil war, and white hats winning. A fairy tale for newbs. Steve P even said don't worry Mr and Mrs America, Donald Trump is fighting for you!. Yes, we can relax, the secret societies, the central Banks they own in every country on earth and their lock on western government is about to end after centuries of ownership....because of "outsider" NY elite bussinesman Trump. Must be nice in Neverland, Peter Pan.

               This whole political show reminds me of
               <em>
                This is Spinal Tap
               </em>
               . They were sort of the ultimate crisis actors.  I hope you are right DarkMath.  This whole charade needs to come crashing down. It is beyond absurd.

                I hope I'm right too. If this doesn't come down people will start taking the law into their own hands and that could get very ugly.

                Poor white people with no job and a college degree can be very menacing when given assault rifles and an excuse to use one. I've never seen this country so rip shit. A lot of very good people have nothing to lose but their chains.

            I hope Trump is about 10 steps ahead of all of them because he needs to be.  The deep state are fools if they think they are going to get off with sacrificing Hillary only.  I can't wait for all of the blackmail pics to come out.  Pedophilia needs to be brought to light.

             , me too.  I agree  completely.  Upvoat for this thread, whether the source is credible or not, for the mere fact that the headline is so fucking encouraging.  They must be exposed.  LET 'ER RIP.  Bring their crimes out in the open and lock them all up.  I cannot stand how frustrated I am by the lack of action.  Thank God for rays of hope we share in there.

               Well, it would be gullible if we thought it was a righteous government that issued fair balanced justice and sent Hillary and her ilk to prison.  In reality it would be the true power clearing out useless political detritus to introduce a new power player.  It is all BS.  None of the actors we are shown are really in power.  They do what they are told and are permitted to fleece the sheep while they are about their father's business.  It is ridiculous and I am well and truly sick of them all and their YouTube floggers.

                         Yes, Hillary will rat out everyone. There's no question about it. That's why everything's coming down.

                         The "old" vs "new" Mossad should be looked at as the "old" vs "the fall guys". The "new" Mossad are "The Jews!(tm)" that will be sacrificed. Deep Wasserman Schitz &amp; Co fucked up big time. And they'll be led to the slaughter because of it. This is how any Mafia works. It's just business.

                            Say, why did they recently cast an anglo like viggo Mortensen and slap crucifix tattoos on him to portray a JEWISH Russian mafioso?  Because morons like you will later use it as unconscious reference point when reading an article about the dreaded "russian" "oligarchs"?  Eat shit
