             Could you be bothered to read the material? ---- The item consists of internal emails from a major defense contractor about using orphanages in Russia as an intel front and taking "healthy" orphans out of Russia.
            </p>
            <p>
             Dyncorp is a similar major defense contractor that was caught in the past trafficking children out of the conflict area of the Balkins.

            Well, the ties of both Podesta brothers, the Clintons, and various campaign personnel with Russian businesses are well documented and quite public. A cursory search will reveal easily confirmable information such as the Uranium One deal. You can read one such article here -

            Anyone can google about blood of children used for anti-aging. Anyone can google for the woman caught trafficking children out of Haiti who the Clinton's helped. Trafficking out of the turmoil in the Balkins in the 90s and early 2000s has also been well-covered.  There is no need for me to use up my time to collect links on items for comments easily referenced on your own.

            We're seeing news break on the topic of using the blood of children to prolong adult life. --- Something occult-watchers have been talking about for decades.
           </p>
           <p>
            We know friends of the Clintons got caught trying to smuggle children out of Haiti.  We've heard reports of child trafficking out of the war-torn Balkins.
           </p>
           <p>
            In the emails above, we see the woman reference a scandal involving the deaths of "several" orphans adopted out of Russia into the US.
           </p>
           <p>
            The question is --- why is an outfit like Stratford (or Dyncorps) getting involved in orphan transplanting? What happens to the kids after they leave Russia?
           </p>
           <p>
            Just in these emails, we see this woman connected to running this ratline bringing up covert intel operations (including murders), recruiting children into paramilitary groups, and more.

            What we see in brief here is --- This major government/military contractor is connected to orphanages and religious orgs for intel purposes as well as taking orphans out of Russia. We know Hillary was connected to orgs and individuals taking advantage of a crisis in Haiti to traffic undocumented children. We know Stratford is not a non-profit NGO with a big heart.
