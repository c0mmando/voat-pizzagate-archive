            ' 'fake news' meme disseminating Washington Post, who, may I remind you, published the PropOrNot list, promoting anonymous and shoddy claims that a vast range of some 200 websites are all accomplices or tools of the Russian government. Marty Baron, executive editor of the Bezos-owned Washington Post, also appears to have a loyalty to the intelligence agencies:
           </p>
           <p>
            Heinz Baron and his wife immigrated in 1954 to Davis Island in Tampa, which hosted the airstrip for Coastal Patrol Base 13 of the Civil Air Patrol (since renamed the Peter O. Knight Airport). The backwater airfield was also a jumping-off point for gangsters and shills for Meyer Lanksky’s casinos in Havana. Here it should be noted that the Baron family in Ulanow, Poland, were innkeepers and bartenders aka mobsters. Located where he was, Israeli dual citizen Heinz Baron could not have avoided connections with the Lanksy organization and, later, the CIA plans to topple the Cuban revolution.
           </p>
           <p>
            Close to Tampa and Fort Meyers on the Gulf Coast, Useppa Island was the first CIA paramilitary training ground for anti-Castro Cuban exiles for the upcoming Bay of Pigs invasion. Another confluence of Cuban Jewry in the casino and spookdom is The Miami Herald, where Martin Baron received his apprenticeship. Here is a revealing quote from the History News Network:
           </p>
           <p>
            “The tale of the Miami Herald’s Bay of Pigs scoop and its subsequent capitulation to the CIA has mostly been shrouded in mystery for the past five decades. It was explored briefly in ‘Anything but the Truth’, a book by Washington reporters William McGaffin and Erwin Knoll that was published in 1968 and quickly disappeared.” Herald reporter David Kraslow, who had stumbled on Cuban exiles practicing marksmanship near Miami seven months before the invasion, was forced by CEO Lee Hills to have his article vetted by the State Department and CIA in October 1960. CIA director Allen Dulles killed the Herald story with a phone call to Miami.
           </p>
           <p>
            Martin Baron was apparently a good student of Miami Herald-style “capitulation to the CIA.” The newspaper’s close cooperation with the CIA has gone so far as to provide its espionage agents with cover as reporters, according to Agency officials interviewed by Carl Bernstein. The spy assignments are done with the knowledge of top editors, which later I discovered with the Miami Herald’s role in a CIA-funded terrorist operation planned against American students abroad. The agent-reporter had carried bundled cash from a U.S. embassy to an Islamic terror outfit in at two locations.
           </p>
           <p>
            Amazon.com can, too, be traced back to Las Vegas kingpin Lansky, an architect of the both Bay of Pigs and the JFK assassination, and his Cuban mafia of hidden Jews, which will be explored further on in the arrival of Cuban adolescent Miguel “Mike” Bezos under the auspices of the CIA and the Catholic Salesian Order, a legacy group of the Opus Dei surveillance arm of the hidden Jewish generalissimo Francisco Franco in the Spanish Civil War.
           </p>
           <p>
            There are other parallels between the Bay of Pigs and the Swamp of Swine known as Pizzzagate in the
running of safe-houses, secret passages, drug-smuggling, voodoo, child-rape, homosexuality, money-laundering and media complicity with CIA sponsorship of terrorism and false flag attacks against Americans. It has little to do with Cuba libre and instead everything about organized crime.

            Your propaganda piece will garner much empathy and concern from your 'loyal' customers and 'happy families' dining on your poisoned wares. I suppose you wouldn't care to explain to those families your choice of pagan god as an avatar, the notorious Pan that plays his magic flute and wisks the children away in droves to use as sacrificial offering. Or we could remind them, that they could, let their child attend a concert, late night, with JimmyC's choice of 'premiere' DC 'entertainment'.

             The Comet Pizza crowd has promoted “pansexuality”, which is defined in the LGBT online dictionary as “sometimes referred to as omnisexuality or being ‘gender blind’, pansexuality is inclusive of bisexuality (attraction to both males and females) but additionally includes attraction to other genders and sexes such as those identifying as transgender, genderqueer, bigender,  intersex and . . .” That List goes on into four-letter expletives with whom sexual intercourse is unthinkable and better done with the lights turned off and a condom held on with superglue.

             For example, Comet Pizza’s James Alefantis, who is of Greek ancestry, considers Pan to be his avatar.  The dancing horned god with goatee, a goat’s peter and hairy hind legs blows on the multiple tubes of his pan pipes. Alefantis’s fan devotion to this hedonist demonic figure extended to being a producer of the short film “Chapel Perilous”, in which the protagonist named Levi grows goat horns as a sign of his self-discovery. The film’s title is taken after the Round Table knight Percival’s encounter with the “black hand” of Satan in a mysterious chapel during his Grail quest, that being the moral specter of masturbation. - See more at:
