            Yes that's how it works. Finally somebody with some brains figured it out. All the shops around there are fronts for special interests. The interest can be determined by the name of the business, the theme of the business, the webpage of the business, the symbols they use, and the owner. For example Comet Ping Pong is followed on social media by NASA so I figure Jimmy is a NASA, aerospace, lobbyist. TeraSol, A french bistro and artisan gallery, terra means earth or ground, sol means sun or solar, owned by Sabrina Ousmaal long time Associate Publisher for The Energy Daily (renewable energy publication). solar panels! She works for a company called AET. If that's AET Solar then we have a match. They are the only AET is the only Federally Approved 100% american made Solar Manufacturer.

            I found this... From the Jacksonville Business Journal:
            <a href="http://www.bizjournals.com/jacksonville/news/2015/03/26/local-business-leader-meets-with-white-house.html">
             http://www.bizjournals.com/jacksonville/news/2015/03/26/local-business-leader-meets-with-white-house.html

            Local business leader meets with White House officials to push international trade
Mar 26, 2015, 2:30pm EDT Updated: Mar 26, 2015, 4:03pm EDT
Byron E. Small "Andrew East of AET Solar is bringing the First Coast's need for free trade straight to the White House."
AH Free trade agreements. TPP fast track right!
Continuing, "East, executive vice president, was invited to the White House — and then invited back — to speak with officials about the importance of international trade for his Green Cove Springs company, and how presidential power over trade authorization can help companies like his.
“It would remove additional barriers to entering those markets,” East said. “It lets us participate in a global marketplace where American goods are more competitive.”
East said there were several key ways European and trans-Pacific trade agreements could help his company, a major manufacturer of solarthermal collectors.
“It allows us to enter markets more cost-effectively,” East said.
The United States and Europe have similar testing regimes, but they differ slightly in when one test is performed. East said to carry multiple certifications for different regions of the globe would be very costly. With the new free trade agreements, there would be reciprocity for certification bodies.
“It would streamline that process without the need for additional certifications,” East said.
Another benefit would be the removal of tariffs, which add costs for merchandise to be sold in other continents.
“If those barriers to trade were removed,” he said, “we could offer our goods at a more cost-competitive rate.”
Another benefit would be an improved trade position for the region, which would benefit companies throughout the area.
“I think these agreements offer more goods and services to flow through ports,” East said. “That just lowers logistics costs to the market.”
At the White House last week, East and other small- and medium-business representatives traveled with Business Forward, an organization that specializes in bringing small business leaders to brief presidential economic advisers on the situations they face.
While there, East met with Michael Froman, an ambassador and U.S. trade representative, the deputy secretary of commerce, the first president of the Export-Import Bank and Tom Vilsack, the secretary of agriculture, among others.
In about two weeks, East said he plans to return to meet with the assistant to the president for public engagement and intergovernmental affairs and the director of the national engagement council.
“We can help provide some perspective to the administration,” East said, and added that his company is protected from downturns in the domestic market because so much of its growth revenue comes from export sales.
East also said he was pleased there is a regional push for exporting in Northeast Florida.
“It has tremendous impacts on the local economy,” East said of exporting. “All ships will rise when that tide comes in.”

            That last phrase is important because on TeraSol's website it says now boarding bon voyage or whatever right? Check it. So that's how you know. The owner of TeraSol also works for IHS...

              Auma pays for her system through a lease-to-own program run by M-Kopa Solar, a Canadian company. Customers make a small down payment and then make daily payments of pennies a day, sent via the M-Pesa mobile payment system. 
Solar power is rapidly spreading throughout East Africa. M-Kopa has connected 50,000 homes in Uganda and 40,000 in Tanzania. Mobisol, a German-based company that offers a similar lease-to-own service, says it has delivered electricity to more than 45,000 households and businesses in East Africa, mostly in Rwanda and Tanzania, and is planning to expand to Kenya. Orb Energy, an Indian solar energy firm, has partnered with Kenya’s local Equity Bank to advance low-interest loans for those who want to buy equipment—solar panels, and solar-powered water heaters, lamps and TVs.

              </a>
              President Barack Obama’s signature initiative for Africa -- a $9.7 billion plan to double electricity access in the world’s poorest continent -- has fallen well short of its goals, so far producing less than 5 percent of the new power generation it promised. [picture of M-Kopa solar behind obama, the O is Stressed, proving connection to Obama because it's like the Obama logo.]
“If you look today at the number of megawatts that are actually on the grid directly related to the Power Africa initiative, it is very little,” John Rice, vice chairman of General Electric Co., said in May at the World Economic Forum in Kigali, Rwanda.
             </p>
             <p>
              Power Africa, he said, “was a well-intentioned effort, with a lot of smart people, a lot of willing participants, financial institutions
             </p>
             <p>
              The program’s shortfalls mean that when Obama leaves office, the nation’s first black president and the son of a Kenyan farmer won’t be able to claim a legacy-defining endeavor in Africa. By comparison, President George W. Bush’s signature initiative in Africa -- the President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief, or PEPFAR -- provided drugs to fight HIV to more than 2 million people by the time he left office.
General Electric declined to make Rice available for an interview. Power Africa’s leaders say they are redoubling efforts to accelerate progress. U.S. agencies announced $1 billion in new loans and financing on Wednesday for projects in Ghana, Kenya, South Africa and elsewhere.
             </p>
             <p>
              Andrew Herscowitz, Power Africa coordinator at the United States Agency for International Development. Results will take years, he said.
Herscowitz said Power Africa is backing projects across the continent, showing that the private sector is responding to U.S. efforts. A burgeoning market for solar panels is cropping up in places like Rwanda and Sierra Leone, and companies have committed more than $40 billion to dozens of Power Africa projects, he said. USAID estimates the initiative will ultimately provide electricity to 60 million households in more than 20 countries.
"Three years after launching Power Africa we’re seeing real progress," Obama said at the forum on Wednesday, citing solar power and natural gas projects in Nigeria and "off-grid" power generation elsewhere on the continent.
             </p>
             <p>
              -----ah backup generators Nigerian Outages! I've read pipelines for energy in the region keep getting cut, electricity unreliable, so solar panels on rooftops would prevent this---
             </p>
             <p>
              That’s evident on a visit to the main electronics market in Lagos, Nigeria, where shouting street vendors compete with hundreds of roaring generators that spring to life daily during power outages that last hours.
             </p>
             <p>
              Sub-Saharan Africa has the world’s largest concentration of people without power. More than 620 million people in the fast-growing region lack a reliable supply of electricity, according to the International Energy Agency.
Power Africa enjoys some congressional support, suggesting it could survive Obama’s presidency. Representative Ed Royce, the Republican chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, said the aim is for the private sector to continue to invest after Obama leaves office. He sponsored legislation, signed by Obama in February, that encourages future administrations to continue investing in Africa’s power sector.
             </p>
             <p>
              “All of us understand that dealing in Africa in terms of development work is a long process,’’ he said. “You’ve got 600 million people in the dark in Africa without electricity --so it’s going to take time.’’
‘Many Years’
             </p>
             <p>
              Obama pledged to provide “light where currently there is darkness’’ and double access to power across sub-Saharan Africa when he introduced Power Africa in 2013.
             </p>
             <p>
              The initial five-year time line for the program was later increased to 15 years, and the goal for increasing electricity access expanded to 60 million households by 2030, the target Obama cited Wednesday, up from 20 million. The initial $7 billion commitment has increased to almost $10 billion.
             </p>
             <p>
              In Nigeria, a U.S.-backed effort to privatize power plants would add about 2,500 megawatts to the grid. 
In the U.S., congressional gridlock over the Export-Import Bank has handicapped progress. The bank, which lost its charter for several months last year, was slated to provide $5 billion in financing out of the initial $7 billion U.S. commitment.
             </p>
             <p>
              It has only provided $131.5 million so far, and hasn’t approved any additional financing since July 1, 2015. An aide at the bank said Senate Republicans’ refusal to fill vacancies on its board has left financing for several Power Africa projects stuck in limbo. Without a quorum, the bank can’t approve deals worth more than $10 million.
             </p>
             <p>
              In Nigeria, a change in political leadership, currency controls and an economic recession sparked by falling oil prices have spooked investors.
             </p>
             <p>
              Suspended Plans
             </p>
             <p>
              Transnational Corp. of Nigeria Plc, an affiliate of one of Power Africa’s largest partners, last month suspended plans to build a $1 billion power plant, citing a surge in militant attacks on oil pipelines. - ah HAH! Obama is behind those attacks frustrating competitors 
 Another project, the Azura-Edo Independent Power Plant, was delayed for months due to regulatory obstacles. The 450-megawatt plant is now moving forward, in part due to legal assistance from U.S. advisers, Herscowitz said.
“The regulatory environment is quite rigid,’’ said James Nicholas, co-founder of Global Business Resources USA, which plans to build two solar plants in Nigeria. “It’s bureaucratic.”
Todd Moss, a senior fellow at the Center for Global Development,
“I worry that the sustainability of the initiative is at risk when a new administration comes in and they have their own priorities,” said Moss, a former assistant secretary of state in the Bureau of African Affairs. ah so Trump will kill this deal.
Royce said investors see promise in a region where many consumers spend billions of dollars on expensive and dirty diesel generators. Power Africa counts Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Alphabet Inc. and Citigroup Inc. among its corporate partners.

               So this is what is going on my friend. Clinton at the state department is the go between, between Obama and lobbyists for companies all around the world that want to be part of the "Clinton Global Initiative" which TPP is a large part of. They pay Clinton as lobbyists do using these shops as meeting places and places for fundraisers and then... Clinton gives them access to Obama. They see the big man. And if he likes them he puts them in TPP and Tarp, etc. It's a lobbyist and special interest thing. There is a child angle, but that's not the main purpose.
