This post connects the old pedo guard to the new. Phyllis Schafly is connected to Alefantis. Barney Frank was at that small Media Matters party in 2009 with Alefantis and David Brock. </p>
<p>I only noticed that 2009 party\'s site because of this post, which also got relatively overlooked - only getting to 32: <a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1428757">https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1428757</a></p>

Terry Bean, the Obama and Clinton bundler, got off when his victim refused to show up to court. Most likely that was because the victim was paid more than 200k in a civil suit and took the money instead of testifying.</p>

There are many good posts about the Pizza Connection, none broke 20+. Why does the Pizza Connection matter? Same trafficking channels, new use. Human Trafficking is the new Drug Trafficking cause it\'s more profitable.(<a href="http://archive.is/k6spO">Link</a>) We know the mafia in former Yugoslavia countries were funneling them to Italy.(<a href="http://archive.is/7bBgf">Link</a>) Maybe pizza places are fronts once again. Nevertheless, the first post is useful either way because the Clintons ties to the Mafia belies many of their connections.</p>
<p>As for two posts that we caught up with:</p>
<p><a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1457328">https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1457328</a>
This had lots of good information about Bob Menendez, two months before most of the same subject matter would break big on this forum. </p>
<p>The Interim DC Police Chief Newsham stuff finally broke - but was also posted a month ago: <a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1485802">https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1485802</a></p>
<p>Morals of the story? </p>
<p>1) Always use search here when going down a new rabbit hole. Someone may have done much of the work already. In particular, it seems like a ton of information was overlooked when this forum was just getting going two months ago.
2) If you have really good info, post it here, but also in another forum that collects, holds and links information. No surprise, but the Pizzagate.Wiki gets my endorsement.</p>
<p>Have a good, sourced, overlooked post? Feel free to add any additional good overlooked posts here in the comments and I\'ll edit this post to include them.</p>
<p>To Mods: I understand how this can appear to be a &quot;Meta&quot; post, but it\'s intended to be a repost of the top posts that were overlooked - reposting being frequently allowed on this sub - as well as a discussion on how to improve research techniques in this investigation.</p>',

            Phyllis Schefly who is now dead btw was an author of many many books, and toured to support them tirelessly (despite the fact she hypocritically preached in her books that women should stay at home.)  So just because  she and Podesta might have attended a book event at the same time or some other function once does not mean they are actually connected.
           </p>
           <p>
            Can you prove this assertion that they were connected?   I find it highly unlikely on the surface as she was an arch conservative and he of course a liberal.  However DC does make strange bedfellows as we know too well.

             I agree. I haven't found anything connecting them. I didn't see anything in the Podesta emails. Did you find something?
One of her sons was homosexual, but mother and son got alone fine. He worked with her and is a conservative.

            Thanks, I actually spent a very long time putting it all together into the post from several open windows of articles I've had bookmarked from months ago and trying to place then in the right order etc with a quick explanation but I also have grandkids who keep taking my attention away among other things and eventually I ended up needing to post what I had so far because there is no way to save and go back. The people who do whole blogs and post links to them here get their posts deleted usually but seems the best way to do a thorough post.

            What is fantastic about this post is that it is a litigation case already in process, and it involves the UN, the Clintons, a suspicious death, human trafficking and Preet Bharara who has yet to cower to anyone. Unless there is a settlement, shit IS going to come out.

            If the info was already on here why would I make a post about it? If you can do it better feel free to reinvestigate and do it again, I don't call dibs, I want the truth out...if you are just looking for things you recognize in a title before bothering to read through then you just think it is too much trouble. I could give a cr@p less if it get's upVoats as long as important people have seen it and can use the info....and if you really don't know who Preet Bharara is then you should because this is important information relating to pizzagate....

             letters written in support
            </a>
            of Klaman that are from interesting sources, here's a few that stand out:
           </p>
           <p>
            One letter from a former news anchor:
 "By way of introduction, my name is Charlie Gibson. For 33 years I was a journalist for ABC News. For 19 of those years I was a host of Good Morning America and for the four years before my retirement I was the anchor of World News with Charles Gibson, ABC's evening news broadcast. For 46 year~ I have been a friend of Chris Kloman's."
           </p>
           <p>
            Gibson might have been mentioned before but I can't find anything on this next one where the name of the person writing in support was removed:
           </p>
           <p>
            "I am 70 years old and practiced law with the St. Louis law firm of Bryan Cave McPheeters &amp; McRoberts for many years. Both during that time and after my retirement from the practice of law, I have also been
            <strong>
             Chairman of the Love Companies,
            </strong>
            which is a group of banking, mortgage banking and investment firms headquartered in St. Louis and with respect to its FHA Multi-Family Mortgage Banking business with offices in D.C. and other major cities in the United States."
           </p>
           <p>
            (side note: throughout the various letters of support, people claiming to be lifelong friends of the family are spelling the guy's name "Kleman" "Kloman" and "Klaman", sometimes all three ways, in the same letter, from the same supporter)
           </p>
           <p>
            We may deduce that this unnamed supporter is
            <a href="http://thelovecompanies.com/about/team.html#love">
             Andrew S Love
            </a>
            "Mr. Love is Chairman, Co-CEO and a principal owner of Love Savings Holding Company. He is also Director of Heartland Bank, Chairman of the Bank’s Finance-ALCO Committee and serves as a Director of Love Funding."
           </p>
           <p>
            Another interesting connection pops up when we look at

            I always hope someone with power or real journalists who can do something with info, are paying attention because I feel like many of my posts and comments don't get any action with VOAT's....I can only hope it's because they took my lead and ran and never came back to upVoat me.

             This was a great post, but everyone was over at the organ trafficking and Ginsberg threads. What is fantastic about this post is that it is a litigation case already in process, and it involves the UN, the Clintons, a suspicious death, human trafficking and Preet Bharara who has yet to cower to anyone. Unless there is a settlement, shit IS going to come out.

            Awesome awesome job! Thank you so much. I had been looking for a link between Franklin/Boystown and Pizzagate and I found it but then couldn't remember it so this is greatly appreciated. I also am taking another very very hard look at the Seth Rich case again and specifically DC police dept. I'd bet a great deal of money DC Police  are HEAVILY involved in this. Have no doubt at all.

             I have no doubt that if DC police didn't do the S. Rich crime than it also connects to the tunnels, this is my hunch because no traffic cam footage has been released. If Seth wasn't killed for leaking, than perhaps for the suspicion of it or what else he may have learned. Just like John Ashe in Nana66's UN corruption post,  too many people around the Clintons are dead, and their reach spans the globe.

            This is not a Meta post -- it is directly related to the investigation, in my opinion. Meta means unsourced bitching about the investigation or the board or whatever. At least that's how I see it. This was a great post, and much needed. Thanks for putting it together.

             This is a great idea, weedageddon. Unfortunately, Mods are barely keeping their heads above water at the moment just trying to vet new posts and keep the shitposts to a minimum.

               Another great thing would be to contact the OPs of important past threads that generated a lot of research and have them edit the post to summarize what was discovered. That way when people go to TOP, they will get the whole picture and not have to read so many comments. I've been trying to do this, but...not enough time! Argh.
