            I plan to watch later when I'm feeling emotionally stronger. At times it is good to return to the victim as it makes us remember what we are fighting. A lot of times it is easier to push this part aside because the mind does not want to contemplate it. Can't even fathom living through it when just imagining it puts me in such a highly distressed state. But humans were not meant for this. God, don't turn Your face away from Your creation, we need Your healing presence.

             Very well put. It is extremely difficult to hear what Anneke has been through and as I've said to another,  it does feel like being a sick voyuer in many ways. I struggled to write the OP let alone of lived through it . Anneke is a phenomenal woman and through her and other victims being brave we do have opportunities to eradicate this evil from our Earth.

            Trump has said our biggest enemy is Europe...paraphrased. Ritual Satanic abuse is mentioned in the book Holy Blood , Holy Grail ,(p 291) in a poem written from 1220 to 1230. Re. Knights Templar.......I have copied and pasted a description of the poem naming them here.............."1220-1230
           </p>
           <p>
            Introduction. The anonymous 'Perlesvaus' (entitled 'The High History of the Holy Grail' by Sebastian Evans in his translation) is believed to have been composed on the continent of Europe, circa 1220-1230, as a continuation of Chretien DeTroyes' unfinished work "Perceval, or the Knight of the Grail".
           </p>
           <p>
            "There are references to a sanctioned ritual of king sacrifice, most incongruous in a purportedly Christian poem.---- There are references to the roasting and devouring of children...........a crime of which the Templars were popularly accused. At one point there is a singular rite which again invokes memories of the Templar trials"...........

             this previous submission

           <blockquote>
            <p>
             Anneke Lucas was a sex slave to Europe's elite when she was six years old. Pimped out by her mother and by a Belgian cabinet minister to VIPs, European heads of state and a member of a royal family, she recounts the abuse and says
            </p>
            <p>
             "I was used for an S&amp;M show, on a low stage, chained up with an iron dog collar, and made to eat human feces."
            </p>
            <p>
             When she bravely spoke up to the drugged, bored rich adults who were abusing her and other children, she was taken to a cellar and was shown the fresh body of a young murder victim to ensure her silence. When she was ten and of no use to the rapists any more, she was tortured and ready to be killed on a butcher's block when her life was spared.

             Yes she is, totally bang on. I thought there would of been something about her here but did not scroll back far enough I guess. You've written about far better than I , I really struggled to even type her horrific experiences down. She has inspired me so much with her grace about it.

             I actually did feel like a sick voyuer watching her speak of this horrific evil. I struggled writing the post as just typing some of Annekes experiences felt so wrong.. Her story was told with such grace I felt so humbled. My mother went through similar but not to 'elite' scum :(

             So very sad yes.It was very difficult to hear her talk about it , I've only known about these things in the last few years and hearing Anneke describe what I've read about was horrifying. It made me feel like a sick voyuer tbh..but I am blown away by the strength of her soul and found some comfort hearing her talk about the spiritual assistance she had.

            I'm one of the best Hypnotists in the US. I made this account because if I used my regular one it would be too easy to use all the info to DOX me.
           </p>
           <p>
            This is real.
           </p>
           <p>
            I've talked to some of the victims.
           </p>
           <p>
            Usually what happens is I get a call to see if I would be interested in talking to one of them and set up a phone interview. After the interview if I think I can help we set up a video conference. A few days after the interview, a US Marshall will drop off the full payment in cash up front, so I guess they are in some kind of witness protection program? I need to be able to see their eyes, and watch their breathing for the hypnosis so they can't completely obscure the girls faces but they do wear a face covering so I can't identify them.
           </p>
           <p>
            When I see them, these girls are really messed up. Dissociative identity disorder, severe anxiety, PTSD, hypnotic conditioning... they have obviously gone through emotional trauma.
           </p>
           <p>
            All the people contacting me are after is to try and bring them back to some form of being "functional".
           </p>
           <p>
            This stuff is really messed up. I just needed to get it off my chest.

             Why on Earth would someone bring a traumatised and mentally ill woman to a hypnotist? Doesn't make sense.
            </p>
            <p>
             Long years of psychological counselling, deep inner work and some pretty hardcore drugs are needed to deal with DID and the other conditions you mention.
            </p>
            <p>
             Most of these victims would not be able to be hypnotised anyway. Trauma makes people control freaks, unlikely to trust, always on guard, spider senses up, living in a state of high anxiety. These are not people conducive to hypnotism.

              Hypnosis isn't what you see in the movies. It has absolutely nothing at all to do with giving up control. In fact, it is just the opposite.

              One of the studies I like reference is for clinical depression. It showed that the recovery rate for different treatment methods is:
             </p>
             <p>
              Psychoanalysis: 38% recovery after 600 sessions.
             </p>
             <p>
              Behavior modification therapy: 72% recovery after 22 sessions.
             </p>
             <p>
              Hypnosis: 93% recovery after  6 sessions.
             </p>

             <p>
              So the reason they are bringing them to me first is that when hypnosis works, it works very, very quickly. Secondly, in these kind of cases psychiatry tends to make them worse. Modern psychiatry basically operates on drugging patients long term with drugs that have only barely been tested for short term use. There are a ton of former psychiatrists out there claiming not only is psychiatry a fraud, but that it is explicitly harmful. I actually have clients that are psychiatrists that come to me instead of their colleges because "I'm not going to let them do that to me."
             </p>
             <p>
              But all that is starting to get into a completely different subject and I admit up front I'm a full throated cheerleader for hypnosis.

               I am a survivor of severe childhood trauma. I have experience with psychologists, psychiatrists and in-patient facilities and hypnotists who thought they could 'cure' me in a couple of sessions..  I am one of those it is impossible to hypnotise, as are most people who've experienced complex trauma.  I have not met one professional who prescribed hypnotism--REM therapy, CBT therapy, mindfulness meditation yes.
              </p>
              <p>
               Trauma runs deep. It's never an 'easy fix'. Do I believe hypnotism can work for stopping smoking or bad habits? Yes, but that's not what we're talking about. Trauma re-wires the brain. Hypnotism cannot unwire those centres related to trauma, the changes made to the amygdala. Hypnotism cannot change the physical structure of the brain. The brain is changed only with repeated, ongoing deep work. Survivors of abuse don't just get over it, even with hypnosis; it's a lifelong journey of continuously challenging beliefs caused by trauma, recognising body patterns, recognising triggers and dealing with those triggers, acknowledging the harm done and its consequences, dealing with anger, forgiveness, and much more.  I have to question the people bringing traumatised women to you for 'curing'.
              </p>

               You may denigrate psychiatrists, but then you've not spent any time with really ill people whose lives have been saved and who have recovered some level of functionality after being given drugs to deal with schizophrenia, DID, psychosis.  I know quite a few people who would now be dead without the drugs prescribed by psychiatrists--drugs that make their lives worth living.

                I am a Consulting Clinical Hypnotist. The people you talked about, the "psychologists, psychiatrists and in-patient facilities" refer the second group you talked about, the "really ill people...", when they can't help them.

                That said, I'm sorry to hear about your past, and I'm glad you found treatment that works for you. I wish you nothing but the best.

             You have a traumatic job , my wholehearted thanks to you for being strong enough to do it! My mother went through similar as a child aged 3-12.. She volunteered for the Samaritans and rape crisis centre here in uk,then trained as a counsellor to help people that had gone through similar. She housed social service children and teenagers too and tried to flip the trauma into love.  Angel's on earth is what I call people like you.
