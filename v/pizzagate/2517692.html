<p><strong>SUMMARY:</strong>  <em>This post is really a continuation of my previous post : <a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/2517598">On arrested former UNICEF official Peter Dalglish, Street Kids International, Plan UK and some very royal connections</a> .  Further research into one of the Plan UK board members led to the globalists\' Business Backs Education campaign   which is advocating the privatisation of education by companies which need much further scrutiny. Technology firms such as Facebook, seem to be deeply embedded with them.</em> </p>
</blockquote>
<p>This report was published on 14 January 2015, ahead of the World Economic Forum Annual Meeting in Davos, to raise awareness of the Business Backs Education campaign, launched by the Varkey Foundation in partnership with Dubai Cares and UNESCO. The campaign was launched at the Global Education &amp; Skills Forum in March 2014 by President Bill Clinton together with Co-Chairs Jim Hagemann-Snabe, CEO of SAP and Majid Jafar, CEO of Crescent Petroleum. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Business Backs Education wants to help educators and pupils around the world by working with the private sector to support education where it is most needed.  </p>
<p>This report, written by a team at EPG Economic and Strategy Consulting and overseen by an Advisory Board composed of key figures at UNESCO, OECD and Ipsos MORI, looks at how much the 2013 Fortune Global 500 list (the 500 largest companies in the world by revenue) spent on education-related CSR activities.  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>So that was a report on the website of Economic Policy Group (&quot;EPG&quot;) </p>
<blockquote>
<p>an economic and strategy consulting firm headquartered in London which offers economic analysis, strategic communications and market entry assistance to businesses around the world. EPG has operations in the UK, India and East Africa, and works across multiple sectors including life sciences, healthcare, education, CSR and technology. </p>

<p>Pierre Odiymar who is known for founding the site Ebay and for his board position at PayPal, and also created the Intercept news organization. He is a Clinton Foundation donor ( link to article 55 million donation by Pierre Omidyar ) and donated well over 100k to the Anti-Trump super pac. </p>
<p>When he refers to Nazis, he is asking for the free speech of “Conservatives” and those who disagree with him to be silenced. </p>

<p>Now ex-ambassador Craug Murray\'s remarks make a bit more sense :</p>

<p><em>Just what kind of trouble are the royal family in? The Daily Mail is reporting about Prince Charles’s boyfriend Michael Fawcett, the man who the late George Smith accused of raping him, including in a taped interview he gave to Princess Diana.</em> </p>
<p><em>The “free hand” thing appeals to British journalists’ sense of humour, but it’s also meant to distance Prince Charles from whatever dirt – and we are talking about “entertainment” for the super-rich – may soon attach to Fawcett.</em> </p>
