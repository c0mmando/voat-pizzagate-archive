            Great post and yes, lots to dig deep on. I am seeing the effects of Epstein and his penchant for the sex doll robot transhuman fuck doll. I wonder if this was partly attributed to his sick humor and perversion. Not really connected but I recently watched a Bill Burr special where he addresses (in his humorous way) the future of fuck dolls for the geeks and the perverts. Love Bill Burr by the way

            It is my understanding that Natasha/Natalia are commonly interchangeable in Slovak languages.   Then in English we would say Natalie.

            So it's all about transhumanism! Ahhh the pope is saying weird things that are
           </p>
           <p>
            Church canons, th e dems are saying eat no meat, unless you eat other humans. Omg, this is the undercurrent that is going on justifying the pedophile. Being pushed in all universities and wedding out our students. No wonder they are crazy as bed bugs. But these humanists keep rolling along, laughing about how they are duping the public until they move for the guns and put us in reeducation camps. Unbelievable

             Hi my friend. As usual you make too much sense. Although scary I so agree with your comment.  These Quasimodo Frankenstein transhumanist scientists are frightening I am sure many think this is all a joke and will go nowhere. Yes this all may just end badly as a pick up your guns to settle it once and for all. Sad but true. RIP Molly.

              Thanks, Carmencita! I think of you often and glad you remember me. I had moved over to ha voat and had tried to not be so involved in pg because it is so upsetting. I know it honestly it is true and the more I see of the gay pride trans pride drag queen push, I see the push to ultimately change people protecting children from the debauchery. Making it ok to see these (almost) naked men carrying pride flags-when we know kids have been told rainbows and the colors of the rainbow are a good thing. Subtle to start, then...the push in the parades. Thanks for remembering Molly. I still believe something will come out when the Awan brothers are brought up again, and we see that it was always about DWS, the Awans, the Pakistanis and their satellites. I keep praying that Pres Trump will be able to help with your home state. It is very distressing and disturbs is greatly that tptb in CA have let what’s happened has happened. Two friends(who are liberals) went to SanFran in June for a graduation and came back with terrible stories. Sadly, still liberal, and aren’t conceding that the dems did this to the state. Completely delusional. Like almost all the libs.

               Oh dear. Are you and I the only ones that know the real truth about Molly? Her death ties into so much that we post about. Especially her ties to Seth Rich. Also Joe Montano close side of Tim Kaine died at same time. He also did voter outreach like Seth Rich. Hard to find articles say that all three knew each other. Yes when the dirty rotten lies and truth comes out regarding the Awans and DWS you and I will not be surprised as to what they are guilty of. RIP Molly Seth and Joe. Thank God for people like you. We need you here. Very few know about Molly. She was the key to so much.

                Carmencita, last night I got the biggest shock to me in a long time about Molly’s case. It has not died- someone who knew Molly and she was one of his good friends is doing his best to bring the murderers to justice, because her murder was a message to him that they would get to his wife and do to her what they did to Molly. It goes very very deep-rod Rosenstein is the culprit and he is dirty and horrible and has been for a
               </p>
               <p>
                Very long time. The gist is that she realized that the satellites being used to track global warming and the possible heating of the earth actually picked up on the heat being generated by the human traffickers. At least that’s what I think I understood from the articles I read. They are written in lawyer/government language and it’s been a long time since I’ve been forced to read such convuluated documents. I will figure out a way to get them posted here so you can read. First thing I have seen about this in so long and it made me think it may be solved and she is vindicated.

                 Oh my God. This is the best news ever. How great it would be to do a post on it and her. The reason for her death is unbelievable but also true. Please keep me in the loop. Would be great if it exposed the Seth Rich involvement as well. But just Justice for Molly would be so beautiful. Thank you 🙏

                  The person who was friends with her has endured so much, but I think he was a cia spook who has seen everything in his life. He knows all that happened to Ambassador Stevens.  More horrible than can even be imagined. I will figure out how to send over the thread with what he reveals about Molly and others.

                I have tried to find out if some other classmates know anymore about anything being done to solve her murder. A big year reunion is in a month. I thought I’d ask then if any new news. It is so sad she won’t be at this reunion. But I am glad that many of us shut down Comey coming to teach an ethics class, when we all know that no one in the deep state has any ethics.

                 I’m sorry I know it’s not funny but I had to laugh at Comey and ethics. HaHaHa.  I will be eagerly waiting to hear what your alums may know.

                 About the rainbow. Really the Rainbow was featured many times with Jesus in pictures many years ago. This is another piece of creation by God that they have hijacked. I bet they are waiting to push that Jesus Loves homosexuals while the Rainbow gleams in the background. Sad and sick. Yes the drag queens reading in libraries is nauseating.

            <p>
             The history of transhumanism is the history of Satanism in our time. It begins with the Cybernetics Group, a CIA front, headed by Norbert Wiener. In God and Golem, Inc., Wiener compares the creation of artificial intelligence with the Kabbalistic legend of the golem, a supposed living being created through magical means.
            </p>
            <p>
             From the Cybernetics Group also emerged MK-Ultra, the CIA’s “mind-control” program, which was an extension of the Nazis’ experiments on schizophrenics, imported with Operation Paperclip. MK-Ultra promoted the “mind-expanding” quality of psychedelic drugs, based on occult legends that the shamans of ancient times used similar substances, equated with the “apple” of the Tree of Knowledge, to contact the spirit world.
            </p>
            <p>
             Through MK-Ultra patients among the Beat Poets, like Allen Ginsberg, and agents William S. Burroughs, the CIA produced the Hippie culture of 60s. With “sex, drugs and rock ‘n roll”, they fulfilled the plans of the Frankfurt School to overthrow traditional morality by way of the infamous bands of the Laurel Canyon scene, in league with members of Crowley’s OTO, the Manson Family and the Church of Satan.

            <p>
             Based in Brighton, England, Pearce maintains a series of websites devoted to transhumanist topics and what he calls the "hedonistic imperative", a moral obligation to work towards the abolition of suffering in all sentient life.[4][5][6] His book-length internet manifesto, The Hedonistic Imperative (1995), outlines how pharmacology, genetic engineering, nanotechnology and neurosurgery could converge to eliminate all forms of unpleasant experience from human and non-human life, replacing suffering with "gradients of bliss". Pearce calls this the "abolitionist project".

            <p>
             The Zombie Apocalypse Medicine Meeting (ZAMM) is a radically interdisciplinary meeting that bridges science and the arts to grapple with the most pressing challenges of the present and the future. We define a zombie as an entity that is fully or partially under the control of another entity. This includes host-parasite interactions, autonomous technology, and coercion/control in human interactions. These dynamics - where one entity controls another - can lead to unanticipated biological, technological and social consequences. ZAMM brings together scientists, artists, doctors, lawyers, ethicists and futurists to engage with the challenges of zombification and the apocalyptic conditions that may be generated by or contribute to zombification. We use the zombie apocalypse as a lens through which we can engage about potentially frightening aspects of our present and future without fear and anxiety, but instead with imagination and creativity. The goal of ZAMM is to reduce the global burden of zombification and contribute to apocalypse prevention and preparedness through interdisciplinary engagement.

               Well they all preer-review each other's work, and hire and promote each other. I would postulate that all of those involved are actually frauds, or they have been handed a research agenda they then carry out to wide acclaim.

             Summary - Dominik Wodarz is Professor in the Department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology at University of California, Irvine. The subject area of his research is theoretical / mathematical biology, with emphasis on infectious disease, the immune system, cancer, and evolutionary dynamics. His studied Biology at Imperial College, London, and obtained his PhD from the University of Oxford.

            <p>
             We work on mathematical and computational models of biological processes, with the following focus: 1) Dynamics of virus infections and the immune system, 2) Dynamics of cancer and its treatment, 3) General evolutionary dynamics and population dynamics.
             <strong>
              The common theme among these diverse topics is population dynamics as well as ecological and evolutionary theory. A lot of the work is biomedical in nature and thus related to systems biology, where we model the dynamics of cells, pathogens, and molecules.
             </strong>
             This has many practical applications such as the analysis and development of treatments against infectious diseases and cancer. We collaborate with several experimental laboratories in order to couple computational work with data.
