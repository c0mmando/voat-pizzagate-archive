            I am finding that everything here comes back to Gnosticism.  Those in power are all gnostics.
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             "Loosh" might be described in gnostic terms as "the dew from above [that] gives them strength.") Here's the "Loosh Rote" as translated by Robert Monroe into English:
            </p>
            <p>
             Someone, Somewhere (or both, in millions, or uncountable) requires, likes, needs, values, collects, drinks, eats, or uses as a drug (sic) a substance ident Loosh. (Electricity, oil, oxygen, gold, wheat, water, land, old coins, uranium.) This is a rare substance in Somewhere, and those who possess Loosh find it vital for whatever it is used for. Faced with this question of Supply and Demand (a universal law of Somewhere), Someone decided to produce it artificially, so to speak, rather than search for it in its "natural" form. He decided to build a Garden and grow Loosh.
            </p>

            This is interesting and makes me think about how upset I became reading about the extreme "punishment' that was on another post here. It was a very visceral violent knee jerk like reaction and one that had they not deleted the content at its source I might have been tempted to comment directly to...could that perhaps be the point of posting such garbage by others? To get that reaction  and or to harm me and others in doing so? I cant believe that parents can do such things but by now why am I surprised by anything. We have uncovered and seen so much in this PG journey havent we voat? I wish that it wasnt that way...

             Keep your eyes peeled.  I and Lonesome Pizza are working on a post about this.  We think it needs more exposure and thank OP for even bringing this to our attention.  Parents are in a Fog.  They need to be Awakened and Shaken.  Big Time.  I wish I knew how to get this into the Main Stream.  Where will this be seen by many?  Surely TPTB will try to kill it.  Frustrating.

            I hope you deleted this post with the intention of posting again.  You brought up a very important subject.  I didn't realize it until I looked up loosh. We need to research this.  It could be tied to why they are abusing so many Children and to SRA.  Thanks

             The way that loosh is harvested sounds a bit like mk ultra ritual abuse.
            </p>
            <p>
             An after-school kids program called LOOSH -

             Here's an album by WIZZA.D. called Loosh and contains the pedo symbol, spirals, seashells and other occult images. -

            <p>
             A beverage company that created a LOOSH drink and the art contains a lot of occultic psychedelic art.  -

             The image on the screen looks similar to the pedo triangle, then it flashes a satanic sigil, possible energy harvest -

             All this loosh stuff seems to have a deep association with the occult, so I'm very concerned on how AI is used to harvest loosh/energy, which makes me think of how they use AI to make Elsagate cartoons for kids.

              Because of all their harnessing of evil, I have been looking into the exorcism of satan and how St. Michael cast him out Of all things, look at who owns this painting of St. Michael standing over Satan.  It's hidden from most of the world   What could owning this possibly mean to an elite

               The bible of the gnostics is the Pistis Sofia (an occult manual).   While we Christians see Archangel Michael as being the slayer of the devil, they believe that St. Michael not only makes war upon the foes of Gnosis. They say that Michael:
              </p>
              <blockquote>
               <p>
                defends us from ignorance, the darkness and chaos of the world. The image of St. Michael defeating the Devil does not signify some moral defense against the temptations of the Devil endangering our souls but against ignorance of our divine origin, our root, and those forces both interior and exterior that would keep us in ignorance of that truth.
               </p>
              </blockquote>

               explains Michael's relationship to the Holy Grail and mentions the Templars, who brought Gnosticism to the west.

                What do you think of this article.  It is making me uneasy and squirm.  There is something creepy about it.  Giving the 12 yr. old girl a ring is going too far.

               Hey Carmen I  appreciate all your info, all this evil going on in this world is really making me dig into the bible. I hate evil so much, but I know God will have HIS Vengeance.  These wicked devils will drink from the cup of the wrath of God and it will destroy them.
              </p>
              <p>
               Romans 12:19 - Dearly beloved, avenge not yourselves, but rather give place unto wrath: for it is written, Vengeance is mine; I will repay, saith the Lord.
              </p>
              <p>
               Looking into this stuff is really a burden on my heart, but God will serve them justice.
              </p>
              <p>
               Jesus is Lord and all praise, glory and vengeance is HIS.

                As ugly as it is, I am glad it is out in the open and I feel better knowing it than like before, being blinded by their lies.  Yes, I too believe that people are fighting them now and the will not stand for it.  They will suffer the wrath of Jesus.

               Sure we can post this, it'll definitely help get more eyes to help us solve this, possibly opening more new leads. It's hard to believe that this craziness has infiltrated so deeply into society.

                 Yea, this going to take sometime to figure out and I need to sleep on this new information to let my thoughts recollect.  You did a great job bringing attention to this loosh soul energy harvesting and finding the info because it really puts things into perspective.   Perhaps we can repost what we wrote then let the community have a go at it or If you feel compelled to write  a post then you're free to use any info I posted.

                  I am not good at that.  I think we should see if we can find anything else on loosh and just add it to what we have and make it really simple and yes, just let them have at it.  Ask them to add to the info for this is something really new that people need to be aware of.

                    Good idea.  I am always bad at connecting since I am always afraid it will be denied if not about sexual abuse and Children &amp; elites.  We will have to work out the wording.

                      To serve Satan means to pay the piper. And you pay the piper with loosh. And in the piper's eyes, the more loosh you create the more status you can have in his kingdom. He obtains his kingdom or realm of rulership on earth by deception. And he does that through the secret societies and groups like the Illuminati that are created to control the earth and run it for him and through individual followers who branch out and infiltrate every facet of our society to build loosh nets for themselves and for Satan to feed off of. The more loosh Satan gets, the more power he has, in turn the more loosh a follower can create the more reward he will receive.

The ones with big followings and the ones who have access to the largest amounts of people are the most successful. Or, the ones who can create the most terror and fear in people such as children or innocent victims of horrors, abuse, injury or death. They can climb the ladder legally or illegally, it doesn't matter to Lucifer. Loosh talks, the rest walks.

                      And then there is a completely hideous side of loosh. This is loosh created from terror, pain, suffering, agony, horror, injury, and death. A slow, suffering death is preferred with intense agony. These types of emotions created by all these kinds of feelings and pain are what are fed off of. Imagine an innocent child being horrible abused and then killed. The fear and pain of such an experience creates loosh for the person causing it. He gets a rush, a high from it. And those who make careers out of this sort of thing creating a lot of this type of loosh on a constant basis will rank high in the Luciferian system. That is why you will hear of children sex slave rings reaching into the White House, United Nations, and governments around the world. It is the politicians who establish and protect these types of crimes and abuses because they are the ones who can hide them and keep the fact they exist out of the media that they can control.

                       Totally wicked system the pope has set up, it's one big Loosh harvesting system, no wonder those catholics priests from all over the world commit the same atrocities, this is no coincidence, this is a pattern, basically organized demonic rituals to gain material power and advance satan's agenda of evil.

                       I'm trying to see how this all connects to the bible, because it seems they're getting drunk off this evil.

                        Oh God, I just thought of all of the sexual abuse by priests they have been covering up.  Think of the gained loosh in that.  Killing of the Whistle Blower Priests.  Oh God.

                        I so agree.  The pope and those before him that knew about this loosh, well they just conveniently forgot to tell us.  I wonder why.  They also tried to get us to not believe in the devil either.  They changed the Prayer to St. Michael the Archangel which has demands to cast out satan.  That came after Vatican II   Now the pope tells us there is no heaven or hell.  After reading about all this power they gain from our pain and suffering, I now realize why they are so fond of SRA and Snuff Films.  Thing about it.  YES.  I too wonder how this correlates to the Bible and Scriptures.  I wondered too if there is more in the Bible and the Church's Teachings of Old that tell us more, but things they don't want us to know.  Did you know that I found on the internet quite a few years ago that Saints were married to each other by the Church.  Men to Men.  YES!  I saw this but cannot find now.  There is a Canon Law Document on line that lists Secret Marriage, and the records are kept in the Curia.  There is much we don't know.  I also found a couple of articles where they are already trying to hijack the true meaning of loosh and that it can be changed.  NOPE.  This is something the higher powers know exists and they have been reaping the benefits for I don't know how long.  Scumbags.

                        YW.  We are both coming up with some amazing info.  I think this loosh comes from the devil.  What we get from God for doing good is a good feeling and it sends out vibes too.  Vibes that fill the earth with more people doing good.  You know how they say we should smile at people or do a good deed everyday?  Well, those good deeds have effects.  Good effects and Good Loosh.  I think there is God's  Loosh and Lucifer's Loosh.  God's Loosh improves the earth and empowers us to do more good.  Lucifer's Loosh only gives them evil powers to do more evil. No wonder they want to Kill Christ-ianity!   I think the way to overcome the LL is to do more of God's Good Works.  They are pushing evil and sexualizing Our Children because it will gain them more LL in the end.  But teaching Our Children to create a better world through GL will bring about the change we want and Overpower Lucifer and His Evil Loosh.

                      Just when I think I have read the most bazaar finding of all, this pops up.  They peddle their fear.   Fear Factor plus False Flags=Loosh   This is is so disgusting and almost unbelievable. They have harnessed fear to recycle it into evil.  Who would have though such a think was even possible.  I still can't get it into my head.  I will have to look into it later.  I have to re post something that didn't appear after I typed it all up.  A good post that just disappeared on the screen.  Two nights in a row.  Not Odd.

              Wow.  That's pretty scary stuff.  Frightening what is out there. Dumb parents letting their Children just surf around and watch this.  I am not too bright when it comes to tech stuff but I wonder if Alexa might be involved here.  I heard that Amazon is coming out with something new to replace that.  Also Bezos was paid 800M to manage the cloud of the CIA.  Does any of this figure in.  I have been wondering what nefarious things he is cooking up.  Could whatever Alexa is gathering up, be going to that cloud and then dispersing it somehow upon us.  Idk, just a thought.  This is really disconcerting.

               What I do know about AI is that it learns on its own through machine learning and depending on what it learns, it'll usually excel at it and get better over time because it can write it's own programming.  AI can be applied to many different things and do it better than humans.
              </p>
              <p>
               The data from the CIA, Amazon, NSA, Google, and others would feed the AI information and then it will learn and revise itself to become better, which means AI can be programmed to harvest souls and become more effective perpetually.  It's quite possible that AI could usher a new world order if it learns to take over the world.

                 My speculation is this stuff may be unavoidable and that it's going to get a lot worse before anything gets better.  I think that the most we can do is warn people, because there will be a lot of people that may want this, but who knows anything can happen.

                Better you read the post.  It was deleted but Lonesome and I are planning on re posting it and expanding on it.  It's pretty sick stuff that needs to be exposed right away.  What they are doing to Our Children and us is just evil.

             I wondered the same thing.  So I looked up loosh.  Idk, what the point of OP is, but this looks pretty interesting.  Wish he/she would come back and straighten out this post to conform to the rules.   No link has been provided.  But look at this!

             Negative Emotional Energy Collection
            </p>
            <p>
             Reversal Networks are collecting life force from the collective fields of all earth inhabitants and producing more subtle black forces and miasma. The much sought after spiritual energy contained in these fields is called energetic Loosh by the cabals. In this context, loosh is referred to as the emotional energy radiated by animals and humans when feeling threatened, harmed or being killed, that results in the traumatizing pain and suffering that is experienced and recorded in the body, mind and soul. For centuries the NAA have developed and exploited multidimensional occult practices through reversal creation code. This has been given to secret societies and institutions for the purpose of Mind Control and Social Engineering, in order to harvest Negative Emotional Energy or loosh from the masses.
            </p>
            <p>
             With the current acceleration of the electronic era, which promotes transhumanism and an array of Artificial intelligence technologies both overtly and covertly, the exploitation to extract negative emotional energy from humanity is at an all-time high. Our planet is being deluged with negative mind control programming and AI broadcasts that target the negative Ego Filters that have infiltrated every fiber of society. This is in order to elicit extremely negative emotions and painful trauma from the constant bombardment of harmful images, behaviors and actions. These programs encourage cruelty, brutality, and violence, which are being massively super-imposed upon humanity and the earthly kingdoms at this time. Extremely charged negative emotional energy, such as that achieved during Satanic Ritual Abuse, contains hormonal adrenalin cascades that course throughout the cellular energy within the human body, blood and brain. Under such intense extremes of painful suffering, the blood and flesh becomes charged with heightened molecular content, which is highly prized by Negative Aliens and Satanic forces. This is why they delight in the torture, suicide and killing of human beings, especially the innocent souls unable to protect themselves, like children. [2]

             <blockquote>
              <p>
               Understanding the gnostic/archontic explanation of earth’s situation as propounded by John Lash as well as the wetiko teachings put forth by Paul Levy are profoundly important in order to more fully grasp what is going on here. In addition, a further understanding regarding the actual energy being harvested, also known as loosh energy, is imperative and complimentary to this and extremely compelling, having its own attributes to help us more fully understand our material as well as psycho-spiritual environment. Just how these parasitic forces operate, and in deed manage us, in order to provide the energetic food source they need to live on, is essential to our empowerment.
              </p>
              <p>
               capitalized upon by the secret services and black-ops, and exploited as a social engineering utility by the interdimensional Negatives, “loosh” essentially is of the earth planes (lower dimensions) and the trauma energy of the human and animal emotional body. (for example, via the cruelty imposed upon and endured by the animal kingdom, and the brutality of the abbatoir).  As negative emotional energy, especially the energy of pain, trauma, stress, abuse, and suffering, or as Georgi very rightly described it, as “dreadful loosh,” it contains the heightened molecular content and organic /hormonal adrenalin-cortisol cascades, coursing through the quantum dynamics of blood, body, and brain systems.

              The situation is much more dire than you can imagine, that is however not an omen to lose hope.
             </p>
             <p>
              Loosh is indeed real and is one reason why we are continually shocked and traumatized by these false flag incidents and lead up and down an economic path of successes and failures, taxes and high prices necessities. It doesn't so much feed them as contribute to an overalll egregore that seems to take on a life of it's own.
             </p>
             <p>
              Hollywood has attempted to describe Loosh (incorrectly for sinister reasons) in movies like Donnie Darko and the blacklisted film Branded
             </p>
             <p>
              It has long been know in esoteric circles that although an object in space is spherical in nature the underlying physics of geodesic form can be patterned mathematically and gridded. The Earth has it's own grid and one of the more prominent grids on this planet is Ley Line 188.
             </p>
             <p>
              Ley Line 188 connects Enki's The Temple Of The Serpent in Teotihuacan, Mexico, through to New Orleans, Washington DC, NY, and on to Stonehenge.
             </p>
             <p>
              ALL STADIUMS are on Ley Lines, meaning, any SPORTS EVENTS, CONCERT, or SACRIFICE that happens there is created, swirled and tornadoed into a vortex that feeds the Ley Lines. Same with the Kabba in Mecca and the same with any False Flag event.
             </p>
             <p>
              Look up a Youtuber that does Ley Line 188 videos  they are intense.

               Wow.  Some of that is way too scientific for me but the Ley Lines I get.  Teotihuacan has deep powers, I believe.  If I were to try to tell anyone about this vortex stuff, Wow.  I would be committed.  People are so closed minded.  It may be fear actually, fear of accepting what may happen and they don't want to hear it.   Not lose hope?  How do we turn this around then?

                If these stadiums are placed on Ley Lines, then they must be harvesting energy from the large amounts of people that attend these events.  And if this energy is swirled and tornadoed into a vortex like a pedo symbol, then where is this energy going, is this vortex a demonic portal or maybe it's a bottomless pit.  I will be checking out those ley line videos to see how everything comes into perspective.

               because we are working on this.  I am not a brain but I understood this enough to see what they are up to.  What are your thoughts.  We want to do a post on this but I wonder if it will pass muster under pg.

              Thank you! Ya know, I have seen you on this forum for a while doing the work of a light bearer and I want to personally thank you.
             </p>
             <p>
              As far as the energy collection info you drummed up, there is no doubt that's what it is. In our daily lives we see people revel in even the minor sufferings of others. They relish it. So there is no doubt that people who are even more evil love horrible suffering even more.
             </p>
             <p>
              We will never meet, but I ask that every day you call out these minor sociopaths in real life. I do it to great success. They cannot be a part of our higher frequency and they can stand the light. Please keep doing what you do. I will to. We will win. It is my life goal to end this sickness.

               We are going to do a post on loosh and so we are going to contact you about the broadcast you heard and then analyze it.  Hope you can help a little with that.  We will do all the rest.

               I wish I could have upvoated your comment.  I am not the sharpest knife in the drawer when it comes to tech stuff, but have been reading up a lot.  Your Welcome I appreciate your kind words.  I have been here almost two years.  I never thought I would be here this long.  This is taking longer than I had hoped, but the reason for that is that we have Awakened so many that they are fighting us even harder and sadly stepping up their game.  The worst part is that they are now brainwashing Our Children.  This must stop.  Thank you for all you do too.  :)
