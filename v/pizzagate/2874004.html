            , thanks for reposting with a new headline. I'm removing this per Rule 3 -- it will still be available in Removed Submissions if you want to link to any of the comments below (Protip: click the "link" button below any comment to get the url for an individual comment).

            Hi there

             @AlphabeticalAnon
            </a>
            . Thanks for crossposting.
            <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/v/pizzagate">

            </a>
            is a bit weird. Unlike most Voat boards, due to the heavy shilling and forum sliding we content with, we have some fairly rigorous submission rules, which are outlined in the sidebar (view desktop site if on mobile). We require titles accurately describe the content and pizzagate relevance, and the body of the post should fully explain the evidence you are presenting with links supporting every major claim.
           </p>
           <p>
            Here is the material that should be in the body of the post:
           </p>
           <p>
            <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/v/TheGreatAwakening/2872079/15244781?=20">
             https://voat.co/v/TheGreatAwakening/2872079/15244781?=20
            </a>
            <a href="https://archive.fo/O1KrD">
             https://archive.fo/O1KrD
            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            The key information Pizzagate researchers need to dig into is:
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             As mentioned, we have found some data on the fact she has run adoptions through her court numbering in the hundreds of thousands, yet the population of Fort Smith, Arkansas is about 80,000 people.
            </p>
           </blockquote>
           <p>
            You'll want a title something like:
           </p>
           <h1>
            Arkansas family court judge facilitating child trafficking?
           </h1>
           <p>
            <strong>
             We'll also need a link directly supporting that statement
            </strong>
            -- such that folks can see the evidence in one click (it's buried as it is being presented now).
           </p>
           <p>
            Since titles on this board can't be edited after the first 10 minutes, I will need to remove this submission and you will need to repost per our ruleset (otherwise we will be accused of unfair moderation). I will give this our 24 Hour Grace flair in the meantime, though, so that the community can get to work on investigating this. Please repost in the proper format as soon as possible. Thanks!

             So I just make another post with that title or something similar and add what that link is? Okay, will do. I'm kinda new and I wasn't even planning on staying on this site as I have this guy who's been following me around and stuff. But I stick it out in the meantime.

             <p>
              You can directly link to any individual comment by clicking the link button beneath it, and pasting the url from your browser window. You can also take a screenshot, upload it an image host like catbox.moe, and past the url. The former is better because it lets people get to all the discussion. The latter is good because lazy people don't have to leave the page. You can do both.
             </p>
             <p>
              Who is following you around? We fight shills in here like crazy, so it doesn't surprise me. I keep dossiers on many of them. Let me know if I can help.

            Jennifer jinks FB .. she’s is a scary creature !
I wonder what would happen if a bunch of us went on her FB and started calling her and her bf Gerald out? I noticed one of her Facebook posts was a “ in loving memory “ post of a little girl who died . Just thought I’d mention that .

             Make no mistake, she is a violent piece of shit. I've seen the pictures of what she did to my friend. And she got away with it scotfree because she's the mommywife of the psychopath Gerald Harrison who is too much of a coward to hit others so he has her do it for him but he planned an assault to be done right along with this bitch Jennifer Jinks. The pastebin link of his long criminal record is exactly the kind of person that Belinga keeps around because he can control him and have him do other crimes. The same piece of shit should be doing 20 years right now but he snitched on this guy he was working for and told the police where the meth was hidden. So in the end, this Belinga is too damned retarded, a retarded nigger, who thinks his willing slave will never roll over on him. It's just a matter of time.

            There is a real lowlife some people have been trying to find some more dirt on since discovering that she rushed through hundreds of thousands of adoptions of kids from foreign countries, namely from a few African nations and Haiti. She also apparently stole the local election as a democrat in an election that was red all the way from more voters in that year as there was a very popular saying in Fort Smith, AR about "running all the democrats out of Fort Smith" and this was a justified action on voters to rid the place of those dems since they stole all the money for more than 10 years that was supposed to go to the sewer lines and highway contruction.
           </p>
           <p>
            So far, just the typical election fraud of a local city called Fort Smith. It's this hook-nosed bitch:

            Hooked nosed ugly bitch who has no children but is a judge over anything to do with children and thinks of herself as an authority on anything family related! The gall and hubris of this corrupted and twisted woman!

            As mentioned, we have found some data on the fact she has run adoptions through her court numbering in the hundreds of thousands, yet the population of Fort Smith, Arkansas is about 80,000 people.

            Yeah all should know what this is really doing and she is definitely a high ranking criminal with the kike stamp of approval.
           </p>
           <p>
            And did I mention she is ugly?

             Yeah okay. But that's just the one comment, the thing I was replying to was something about the swamp bleeding since Clintons are circling the drain. I wanted to just put in the parts that were directly about this corrupt judge and how even someone else pointed out the little kid wearing a "vote for pizza" shirt on her twitter and how it's like the very first picture you see in her little vanity episode of winning an obviously fixed election. As anyone can compare the other one (the one who lost) who is much prettier and looks sane while this Blatt thing looks just hideous and has proven to be very corrupt.

             Anyway, thanks for putting the context of it here.
