<p>Relevancy: CDAN has been central to posting blind items leading to charges of rape/child molestation and even murder.

<p>CDAN dropped a BOMBSHELL a while back. It definitely has legs and it would be great if one of you geniuses out there could track down the actual house. I do have a couple of addresses that I\'ll include as well as some names that may be leads in our ongoing pizzagate investigtaton. I know those related to Beyonce have come up on our radar, but as for the rest, don\'t know or at least don\'t remember. Let me get right to it. Here\'s the tweet I came across, and if you\'re not following this guy, you should! He\'s been on fire lately, and was one called out by Roseanne as being good. </p>

<p>The infamous house on St Charles is allegedly a den of sin where elites go for various sex fantasies. At least one actor engaged in child rape at the house. (NOT John Goodman). And Beyoncé recently bought property near the house. <a href="http://www.crazydaysandnights.net/2017/11/todays-blind-items-st-charles-house-of.html">http://www.crazydaysandnights.net/2017/11/todays-blind-items-st-charles-house-of.html</a>

<p>Enty wrote about the same house yesterday, saying: &quot;Apparently that recent purchase by [Beyonce] has a direct line of sight to the house I have written about here previously. I don\'t think that is a coincidence.&quot; Beyonce recently purchased a church in New Orleans.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Okay, so that\'s the story about this house. Is it the one called the Rising Sun? Who knows! But what I do know is that Beyonce was rumored to have purchased a house in the line of sight to that accursed property. That leads us to TMZ and the rumor of the real estate purchase:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="http://www.tmz.com/2018/05/20/beyonce-buys-church-new-orleans/">http://www.tmz.com/2018/05/20/beyonce-buys-church-new-orleans/</a></p>
<h1>Beyonce Praise Be ... I Own a Church Now!!!</h1>
<p>Queen Bey\'s the new owner of a stone structured, 7,500 sq. ft house of God in The Big Easy. The New Orleans church -- which is more than 100 years old -- was listed at $850,000 ... but it\'s unclear if she got a divine discount.</p>
<p>... Her sister, Solange, lives nearby, too.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There\'s also a pic that accompanies the story. I don\'t usually make reference to the way someone looks, but WTH! Her eyes look dead! Embalmed ... WTH happened to her? </p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://imgur.com/a/rdSMAXH">https://imgur.com/a/rdSMAXH</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Anyway, regarding the story, turns out it wasn\'t accurate. Beyonce didn\'t outright buy it. It\'s sister Solange that had a hand in it ... it\'s why I called out that part of the TMZ article because it does note that Solange lives nearby. </p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://nola.curbed.com/2018/5/21/17376176/beyonce-solange-church-new-orleans-garden-district">https://nola.curbed.com/2018/5/21/17376176/beyonce-solange-church-new-orleans-garden-district</a></p>
<h1>No, Beyonce didn’t buy this church in New Orleans</h1>
<p>But it does have ties to the Knowles family</p>
<p>On Sunday morning, entertainment news website TMZ reported—without a source—that Beyonce Knowles-Carter bought a 100-year-old church at 2930 Camp Street in New Orleans’s Garden District. But based on the records, that purchase is, at best, indirectly linked to Beyonce.</p>
<p>On Sunday night, Nola.com verified that the Noble Jones Trust bought the Camp Street church. Knowles family friend Vernell Jackson Keys signed the paperwork on behalf of the Trust. Nola.com even found this Instagram post that further solidifies Keys’ ties with the Knowles family.</p>
<p>The church, formerly the home of Seventh &amp; Camp Church of Christ, has been marked as sold since May 9, 2018. Redfin listed the last sell price of the church at $850,000.</p>
<p>According to the New Orleans Advocate’s list of property transfers for the week of May 7, 2018, First Christian Church In New Orleans and Seventh &amp; Camp Church of Christ sold 2930 Camp Street to Noble Jones Trust for $100. </p>
<p>Curbed NOLA reported on the Noble Jones Trust in 2014, when we were tipped about Solange moving to 927 St. Ann Street in the French Quarter. In the recent purchase of the Camp Street church, the Noble Jones Trust used 927 St. Ann Street as its official mailing address, according to the Orleans Parish Assessor’s Office.</p>
<p>Based on the records, the purchase of the church has a stronger link to Solange than Beyonce.</p>
<p>In May of 2015, Beyonce’s management company bought a 10,000-square-foot home in the Garden District that sits 5 blocks from the new Camp Street purchase. Coincidentally, the Garden District home was formerly a church. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>First off .... #$100!!!!! She paid $100 for a property worth almost one million? It goes back to the submission about Geffen and how property is discounted and funneled back and forth between members of the elite. </p>
<p>Next, both properties were churches? Both the Camp Street and the Garden District property?Weird! Just fucking weird! I go back to SKANKLES and her quoting biblical verse. But as for Solange, I did a search on her and lo and behold! Seems she\'s one of the 7 top party hosts in New Orleans?!!!! Who knew?!!! </p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="http://www.nola.com/society/index.ssf/2018/03/have_you_been_to_a_solange_par.html">http://www.nola.com/society/index.ssf/2018/03/have_you_been_to_a_solange_par.html</a></p>
<p>New Orleanians know how to throw a party, from crawfish boils to black-tie galas, and of course, Mardi Gras. The city is also lucky to have those who turn having a party into a fine art. </p>
<p>The Salonniere, a website dedicated to the art of entertaining, named its top 100 party hosts in the United States for 2018, including eight from New Orleans: Mary Clare and Danny Conwill, Dawn Dedeaux, Jane Scott Hodges, Allison Kendrick, and Solange Knowles, with Sara Ruffin Costello and Julia Reed making repeat appearances from the 2016 and 2017 lists. (The list was started in 2016.)</p>
<p>Who are these party hosts extraordinaire?</p>
<p>Mary Clare and Danny Conwill are known for the fabulous debutante parties they have thrown for their daughters Clare, Marcia and Mary Elizabeth. For these one-of-a-kind storybook themed parties, the Conwills turn to Bronson van Wyck to make their vision a reality, much to the delight of partygoers. ... </p>
<p>...  Solange not only had her wedding here but chose the city for her home. Her intimate soirees are some of the city\'s most coveted invitations.</p>
</blockquote>
<h1>Intimate soirees?!!!!</h1>
<p>How are they using that term, \'\'INTIMATE\'\'?  
</p>
<p>And if you click on the link of another top party host, you\'ll see the van Wycks hosted an ALICE IN WONDERLAND themed-party ala shades of the Johnny Depp/The Kenyan White House ALICE IN WONDERLAND affair ...</p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="http://www.nola.com/society/index.ssf/2015/01/alice_in_wonderland_themed_par.html">http://www.nola.com/society/index.ssf/2015/01/alice_in_wonderland_themed_par.html</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>So the three things we have are the two addresses of the church and Solange\'s other address. There\'s the purchase in the Garden District: </p>
<p>2930 Camp Street
927 St. Ann Street 
Garden District</p>
<p>For the purposes of showing exact proximity. I first put in the 2930 Camp Street address. </p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://imgur.com/a/S8hWnep">https://imgur.com/a/S8hWnep</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Then I added in the St. Ann and Garden District locations. According to Google Maps, they\'re 20 minutes driving distance apart. </p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://imgur.com/a/15P46w2">https://imgur.com/a/15P46w2</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>So there you have it. I\'m thinking this House of the Rising Sun has to be in the crosshairs of the Beyonce/Solange properties. And there are clues to its identity. I\'m going to go dumpster diving to find it as well as see what those fun hosts in New Orleans have been up to! </p>
<p>Giving money to the Clinton Foundation? </p>
<p>Maybe ...</p>',

           <h1>
            No, Beyonce didn’t buy this church in New Orleans
           </h1>
           <p>
            But it does have ties to the Knowles family
           </p>
           <p>
            On Sunday morning, entertainment news website TMZ reported—without a source—that Beyonce Knowles-Carter bought a 100-year-old church at 2930 Camp Street in New Orleans’s Garden District. But based on the records, that purchase is, at best, indirectly linked to Beyonce.
           </p>
           <p>
            On Sunday night, Nola.com verified that the Noble Jones Trust bought the Camp Street church. Knowles family friend Vernell Jackson Keys signed the paperwork on behalf of the Trust. Nola.com even found this Instagram post that further solidifies Keys’ ties with the Knowles family.
           </p>
           <p>
            The church, formerly the home of Seventh &amp; Camp Church of Christ, has been marked as sold since May 9, 2018. Redfin listed the last sell price of the church at $850,000.
           </p>
           <p>
            According to the New Orleans Advocate’s list of property transfers for the week of May 7, 2018, First Christian Church In New Orleans and Seventh &amp; Camp Church of Christ sold 2930 Camp Street to Noble Jones Trust for $100.
           </p>
           <p>
            Curbed NOLA reported on the Noble Jones Trust in 2014, when we were tipped about Solange moving to 927 St. Ann Street in the French Quarter. In the recent purchase of the Camp Street church, the Noble Jones Trust used 927 St. Ann Street as its official mailing address, according to the Orleans Parish Assessor’s Office.
           </p>
           <p>
            Based on the records, the purchase of the church has a stronger link to Solange than Beyonce.
           </p>
           <p>
            In May of 2015, Beyonce’s management company bought a 10,000-square-foot home in the Garden District that sits 5 blocks from the new Camp Street purchase. Coincidentally, the Garden District home was formerly a church.

           First off .... #$100!!!!! She paid $100 for a property worth almost one million? It goes back to the submission about Geffen and how property is discounted and funneled back and forth between members of the elite.
          </p>
          <p>
           Next, both properties were churches? Both the Camp Street and the Garden District property?Weird! Just fucking weird! I go back to SKANKLES and her quoting biblical verse. But as for Solange, I did a search on her and lo and behold! Seems she's one of the 7 top party hosts in New Orleans?!!!! Who knew?!!!

            New Orleanians know how to throw a party, from crawfish boils to black-tie galas, and of course, Mardi Gras. The city is also lucky to have those who turn having a party into a fine art.
           </p>
           <p>
            The Salonniere, a website dedicated to the art of entertaining, named its top 100 party hosts in the United States for 2018, including eight from New Orleans: Mary Clare and Danny Conwill, Dawn Dedeaux, Jane Scott Hodges, Allison Kendrick, and Solange Knowles, with Sara Ruffin Costello and Julia Reed making repeat appearances from the 2016 and 2017 lists. (The list was started in 2016.)
           </p>
           <p>
            Who are these party hosts extraordinaire?
           </p>
           <p>
            Mary Clare and Danny Conwill are known for the fabulous debutante parties they have thrown for their daughters Clare, Marcia and Mary Elizabeth. For these one-of-a-kind storybook themed parties, the Conwills turn to Bronson van Wyck to make their vision a reality, much to the delight of partygoers. ...
           </p>
           <p>
            ...  Solange not only had her wedding here but chose the city for her home. Her intimate soirees are some of the city's most coveted invitations.

           Intimate soirees?!!!!
          </h1>
          <p>
           How are they using that term, ''INTIMATE''?
          </p>
          <p>
           And if you click on the link of another top party host, you'll see the van Wycks hosted an ALICE IN WONDERLAND themed-party ala shades of the Johnny Depp/The Kenyan White House ALICE IN WONDERLAND affair ...

           So the three things we have are the two addresses of the church and Solange's other address. There's the purchase in the Garden District:
          </p>
          <p>
           2930 Camp Street
927 St. Ann Street 
Garden District
          </p>
          <p>
           For the purposes of showing exact proximity. I first put in the 2930 Camp Street address.

           Then I added in the St. Ann and Garden District locations. According to Google Maps, they're 20 minutes driving distance apart.

           So there you have it. I'm thinking this House of the Rising Sun has to be in the crosshairs of the Beyonce/Solange properties. And there are clues to its identity. I'm going to go dumpster diving to find it as well as see what those fun hosts in New Orleans have been up to!

             It said ''the house'' was in the sightline of the church. It is in a straight line, but it depends on what's between them. Then there's the height of the buildings, etc. Seems like a house near Eighth Street or Harmony would be directly in front of the Camp Street Church.

            <p>
             But the history of The Columns is right on the money.

              Gosh, I don't know.  The Columns does seem pretty far from the Camp Street church.

              I was tired and going off the church B and JZ own (2015), but now I see Enty confirmed TMZ's report she very recently bought the 2930 Camp Street church also:

              Enty wrote "apparently" B has a direct line of sight to the house, from the Camp St. church, so maybe due to the tower?
             </p>
             <p>
              I thought The Columns seemed to fit, but if it did, wouldn't Enty have written that B and Jay-Z's other former church is even closer to the house....?

              Sorry to be so wordy, but this is making my head spin for some reason.

             <p>
              I have to go do a bunch of things, but if anyone thinks The Columns might be the house, I don't know if this is relevant but:

               There is a sprawling house on St. Charles Street in New Orleans that has been used by politicians and celebrities as a secret pleasure den for almost 100 years.

               Understand that the place had been a hotel since 1915....it became sort of a dumpy old political hideaway with lots of escorts and low-class women in those upstairs rooms.

              Also the hotel has five meeting rooms, is that Super PAC related?  That's over my head.
             </p>
             <p>
              And The Columns Hotel/Simon Hernsheim House is closer to Tulane and Loyola than the neighborhood of 2930 Camp St. (Enty mentioned college students there.)

               Idea: What if the first house is closer and allows sight of who goes IN the house. Maybe the Camp Street allows sight of what goes on in the backyard? If the backyard is private, that may be the reason for gaining a new vantage point.

                 It's very clear. Just stick to the basic facts revealed. The hard part is figuring out which house he's talking about because I don't know that area at all.

                   I haven't checked, but am assuming so. Yes, it should offer a spectacular view. I also have to see where Solange's party house is. Wasn't that a church also? I'm thinking if Solange has the front view, and the Camp Street church has the back view, they have all bases covered as to who comes and goes ... and what goes on inside if someone happens to leave a blind or curtain open.

                  I just now followed Camp Street to Seventh to St. Charles on streetview -- and came to the same hunch I see

                  did last night -- The Elms.  I've only checked the location so far though, not Enty's other clues, against The Elms.

                 Then it can't be the one because they said the house is still in the original family's hands. Unless it is being sold now?
                </p>
                <p>
                 It's why I'm not looking in real estate listings. This one was never sold. I'm going to have to try the street view camera on Google.
                </p>
                <p>
                 Oh, but I did see this mansion looking house on a site I went on. They didn't say what it was, but it was on St. Charles. I doubt I bookmarked it.

                  The sign outside said it used to be the Protestant House for Babies

                  In the line of sight of both houses - Camp St. (from tower) and Harmony St  - is this "House".  It has been in the same "family" for a very long time.   It is YUGE.  It is a Protestant Church

                   It is interesting, but could sex fantasy parties be going on in there all this time? That's part of the puzzle.

                   It would seem that a stream of very big names would be frequenting it ... including John Goodman.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   John Goodman might be a clue. It says he's been frequenting the property a lot lately. So where has he been showing up on St. Charles Street? It would seem someone in the neighborhood would know he was coming 'round -- especially since he just had that huge hit show Roseanne hitting number one.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   I'll take a look and thanks.

                    I am tryin to find Goodman's true address.  There seems to be some question as to the exact house.   If I knew this, I could see him walking the dog and take it from there.  We have a lot of bike riders and it would not be unusual if I were roaming around there.  The position of all the properties  - not near any coffee houses to do some sidewalk sitting and watching.
The house at 3102 has only changed hands , but has stayed in the Powe family.  They have a bunch of diff.  LLCs all dealing with real estate.  Check our SOS website.

                      If you can figure this out, this will tell you the owners of each property with just a click.  It is hooked up with the assessors office.   I also know how to look up permits for any renovation questions

                        In the past week, all of this is threatening to come out of the shadows. Apparently one of the masterminds behind it, got into an argument with his father. The father, one of the wealthiest men in the world was killed this week in a freak accident. The thing is though, there was nothing accidental about it.

                        He also mentioned an attempt to kill a father in law in one blind.  Via fire, I think.  Been racking my brain to see if I can remember a fire that was reported then the story was dropped all of a sudden.

               Thanks for the sniffing around. Yeah, it seems rather far. It would make way more sense for the house to be located in that Eighth Street and Harmony vicinity. I'm going to have to figure out how the hell to view those homes.

                  Darn.  It sounded so good.  Beyonce must be very near it.  She bought a church.  Maybe googling the church and then maneuvering around would show the house.

                   I did get a non-street view. Someone suggested The Columns Hotel and it sounded PERFECT! They filmed Pretty Baby there, etc. The map shows this proximity to where the Camp Street church is:

                  <p>
                   While the church is in a direct line, I think if the house were located where Eighth Street or Harmony, it would really be in a direct line of sight.

                   Oh, the other thing is that I'm wondering if there's a rooftop view. I don't know how to go about getting a rooftop view.

            Nicolas Cage
           </p>
           <p>
            Not only does actor Nicolas Cage have a home in New Orleans, but he also plans to make it his final resting place. The actor reportedly bought a pyramid-shaped tomb in the city’s St. Louis Cemetery. And if that wasn’t morbid enough, until 2009, Cage owned the home of famed New Orleans socialite and gruesome slave-torturer Madame Delphine LaLaurie.
           </p>
           <p>
            Is this house where slaves were tortured at the hands of Delphine LaLaurie?

             It's a hotbed of activity. And I do remember reading about the allegation that Jay-Z provided women for Weinstein.
            </p>
            <p>
             I wonder if they do things like JA and his crew allegedly did. Like use the rooftops and such.
            </p>
            <p>
             Oh, and I was wondering about the church connection ... a lot of those churches had tunnels running underneath the. I haven't checked out whether the Camp Street church did, but it's not uncommon -- especially given its age.

                 Sewers, no? You'd have to have them. Lord, I remember an old conspiracy theory about sewers and tunnels in New Orleans. What were there some kind of experiments done? Man, I'll have to give this some thought. I read all sorts of conspiracies, and this was an odd one concerning the flood and getting rid of things in tunnels? Or it could have been sewers ...

                    Yes, we do have sewers.   I would imagine in would be pretty nasty down there.  They are upgrading the drainage on Jefferson Ave right now and the size of the drainage "pipes" is, well, YUGE

                     The sewers aren't any better in Long Island. I believe the sewers were used in the Zodiac Killer case also.

              I always thought he was HOT.  His wife is gorgeous but was ill.  He has 2 daughters I believe.  Use to see him on  David L.  Liked his style cause I used to like Sinatra.  No more Idols.   I think we may have the answer to the house.

                  Well this is the Church and it was bought on 5-09-2018  Possibly the one Beyonce bought which means the House we are looking for is right near there

                   We're taking entylawyer's word for the Camp Street church having a direct slight line of the house. It's why the Columns Hotel doesn't work. It's too far away. The house should be around Eight and Harmony -- where those streets intersect with St. Charles. That way the Camp Street Property would be directly behind it!

             We have many celebrities here.  I am told it is because we leave them alone.  Nick Cage and Brad &amp; Angie used to live here.

              Wow.  Well we certainly don't leave them alone here.  Do you still live in Nola?  I have so wanted to visit their for decades and never made it.  So sad for all the horrid things that happened there.  Do have a clue as to what house it is?  It has to be Huge One.

                 I feel fine doing so.  I was thinking about running up there later on and making sure in person.  I am not sure how "bird's eye view" comes into play, unless they were in the room at very top of church

            Check out hotel monteleone. Owned by same family for over 100 years. Girls Trip filmed scenes there. Renovated 2011. Dad died in 2012, but can’t find circumstances. Lots of history. And many productions filmed there..."

                     said it was wrong place.  We still have not found but what a crazy place that is.  Think of all the crazy horrid stories out there. Frightening. When you think what happened at that House, why not believe what we are researching.

                         this whole New Orl  business is so strange. I remember I saw that Kate Hudson film, set there, "The Skeleton Key", v good film actually, about Hoodoo widely practiced in the state, and I couldn't sleep for a month! I bet that same crap is going on here too in real life. I can totally see Jay Z + Bey practicing spells and whatnot with their illuminati pals, in fact, Bey has built her entire visual career on it. Worse than Spirit Cooking :( Here she is demonstrating it in Formation

              Today, the house has been renovated and restored and serves as luxury apartments for those who can afford them. Apparently, tenants are a little easier to keep today than they were one hundred years ago.

              A law that prohibited the cruel treatment of slaves was in effect in New Orleans and the authorities who investigated the neighbor’s claims impounded the Lalaurie slaves and sold them at auction. Unfortunately for them, Madame Lalaurie coaxed some relatives into buying them and then selling them back to her in secret.

                Cult families are the ones that are still part of the SRA on Victims today.  Evidently if they protected her, her family, then they are part of the cult.

            Maison St. Charles Hotel. Completed a multi-million dollar renovation in 2008 or so (within the past decade). The original townhomes - now incorporated into the hotel - were built in 1842. Can't find ownership info.

              There are some really interesting comments about Rubio  Pence  Cruz Perry and others.  Also a discussion about the Rothschild plane accident goes into detail.  Extremely interesting if anyone has time.  We did a post on this before.  If someone can find it would be Amazing Find, imo.

               Read a bit of the Rubio/Cruz comments and the blackmailed Repub prez candidate fits both. The Rothschild I'll have to look at more closely.
