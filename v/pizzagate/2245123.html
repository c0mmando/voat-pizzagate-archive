            Thank you so much for continuing this research. My original thread was removed, and I’d like for it to be back up once I’m able to provide the necessary information. It’s been raining here in NYC, so I haven’t seen her today.

             Hey, please be safe. Since this was removed (mods compromised?) and isn’t under scrutiny and seen by most people I don’t really know what to do at the moment.
            </p>
            <p>
             If you see her, please tell her to keep it low, or keep in close touch with her somehow. Since you outed her, she could be in danger at worst. We’re talking about the former director of the CIA here. They’re not afraid of shutting people up unless they’re in the spotlight and the public knows about them and keeps an eye on their safety.
            </p>
            <p>
             Millennial_Falcon deleted it, claiming that the post violated rules 2 and 3, and that codewords like pizza, walnut etc. are nothing but bullshit from 4Chan. Something feels off here. It got deleted right after Are_we__sure showed up to shill too (claiming that there are no codewords for pedophile terms). Makes you wonder if they’re the same person.
            </p>
            <p>
             Stay safe. See if you can get some more information from her and learn where all this stuff occurred, who were involved etc. Military bases? Abandoned warehouses? Airports? Farms/Ranch? California? Which states did the abuse occur in?

            I live among Northern California orchards-- walnut and almond. They are common here, followed by rice fields. My dad worked for a rancher that grew walnuts, plums/prunes, and almonds (in addition to dairy and rice)... so it's not unheard of; that said,

             Carmel Valley
            </a>
            isn't in NorCal proper; it's below San Jose, near Monterey Bay, and is more in wine country than walnut orchards. Per

             City Data
            </a>
            , the main industry isn't agriculture. Also per City Data, there's a naval training place about 15 miles away (in Monterey).

            Note the proximity Carmel Valley is to several state parks.Note the topography. Want to find satellite images so I can see the orchards; depending on the size of said orchards would indicate whether they are there for profit (aka legitimate walnut ranching) or as a cover (a small orchard; enough to say it's an orchard but not enough to make a decent amount from the crop)
           </p>
           <p>
            The most notable thing I find about the valley is that there's an airstrip in the center of "town."

            No, wait. The most notable thing is the super shitty what could be a walnut orchard (too much space between trees; it's sparse) on what just so happens to be Panetta Road.

             Thanks for the detective work, appreciate it. Art galleries and sales are widely suspected to act as covers for selling kids. Seems suspicious for sure with the low population density, as you say.
            </p>
            <p>
             Walnuts (pedo codeword) + art galleries (sale/trade of kids) + airplane strip (shipping, flying in) + shady CIA director + Podesta emails referring to walnuts growing in northern CA + registered sex offenders, all in close proximity to one another = suspicion
            </p>
            <p>
             The tree spacing in the "shitty walnut orchard" photo seems to slightly match with the photos here, though the ground is different, no grass on the aerial photo, and his farm seems to be next to a mountain/hill.

            A.  There is no coded language in the Podesta emails, y'all just convinced yourself there is.
           </p>
           <p>
            B.  Walnut sauce is a genuine, non-tomato pasta sauce like pesto (basil and pinenuts).
           </p>
           <p>
            C.   Walnut sauce is from the exact region Podesta's Italian family comes from.

              I find that one of the dumber emails to be suspicious about.    You've never swam in a pool with children?  Seriously?  Do you generally find that to be suspicious?  Never been to family pool party?  Never swam in public pool or a hotel pool?
             </p>
             <p>
              It's a genuinely not suspicious activity.  Unless you think about pedophilia 24 hrs a day.
             </p>
             <p>
              The only way that email is suspicious is if you already have convinced yourself they are a cabal of demons.    Otherwise, it's a grandma trying to be funny?
             </p>
             <p>
              So no code.

           <blockquote>
            <p>
             Leon Edward Panetta (born June 28, 1938) is an American politician who has served in several different public office positions, such as Secretary of Defense, Director of the CIA, White House Chief of Staff, Director of the Office of Management and Budget, and as a U.S. Representative from California. A Democrat, Panetta was a member of the United States House of Representatives from 1977 to 1993, served as Director of the Office of Management and Budget from 1993 to 1994, and as President Bill Clinton's Chief of Staff from 1994 to 1997. He co-founded the Panetta Institute for Public Policy and served as a Distinguished Scholar to Chancellor Charles B. Reed of the California State University System and as a professor of public policy at Santa Clara University.
            </p>
            <p>
             <strong>
              In January 2009, newly elected President Barack Obama nominated Panetta for the post of CIA Director.[2][3] Panetta was confirmed by the full Senate in February 2009. As director of the CIA, Panetta oversaw the operation that brought down international terrorist Osama bin Laden. On April 28, 2011, Obama announced the nomination of Panetta as Defense Secretary, to replace the retiring Robert Gates. In June the Senate confirmed Panetta unanimously and he assumed the office on July 1, 2011.[4] David Petraeus took over as Director of the Central Intelligence Agency on September 6, 2011.[5]
             </strong>
            </p>
            <p>
             Since retiring as Secretary of Defense in 2013, Panetta has served as Chairman of The Panetta Institute for Public Policy, located at California State University, Monterey Bay, a campus of the California State University that he helped establish during his tenure as congressman.[6] The Institute is dedicated to motivating and preparing people for lives of public service and helping them to become more knowledgeably engaged in the democratic process. He also serves on a number of boards and commissions and frequently writes and lectures on public policy issues.
