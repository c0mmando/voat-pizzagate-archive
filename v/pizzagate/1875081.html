            So that you know,  14 years ago when I began the study of electronic voting machines we had to follow the money. It seems that every time you do that no matter the topic it has always led to child exploitation and human trafficking rings for pedophilia.

             You and I seem to be in a similar boat. I also started off looking into electronic vote rigging, but found myself connecting it to numerous other conspiracies, including drug trafficking, Watergate, and child sex rings. Are you familiar with the ownership connection between ES&amp;S, the largest US voting machine vendor, and the Omaha World-Herald, the newspaper who had a publisher implicated in the Franklin scandal and covered it up?

            This ties in to Promis software theft &amp; B. Weld which goes back to HRC. If everyone has not figured it out yet Deep state is Bush &amp; Clinton always has been. Since the very beginning. What is name of CIA building? George H. W. Bush!

            If you did not read the fine print Chinese prison camps are how they get work done. They (china) is who would be your Deep state. The elite would still be protected at top. Everyone else is the prison workers.

              I have a hard time seeing China or Russia doing a false flag nuke and then trying to blame us.
             </p>
             <p>
              My impression of China and Russia today is they look at the U.S. as the really drunk guy at a bar who just bought an 8 ball of cocaine and is about to pick a fight with the 320 lb bouncer who just graduated from Florida State and wasn't fast enough to make the NFL and is really pissed about it.
             </p>
             <p>
              China and Russia are the two good Samaritans who grab you by each arm and walk you backward out the front door as your 186 lbs self yells overly critical remarks about the bouncer's masculinity. It's the booze and cocaine talking and we're a danger to ourselves and others.
