<p>In response to <a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/3361014">my post two day\'s ago</a>, fellow Voat user <a href="https://voat.co/u/NowThatsInteresting">NowThatsIntersting</a> left me a comment mentioning <strong>a Judge Richard Berman being involved in a case against infamous California pedophile Harry Baker.</strong>  That comment links to <a href="https://beyondhighbrow.com/2009/10/13/the-strange-saga-of-harry-baker/">a blog post</a> which states:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;A woman and her husband and two others have been arrested on Child Pornography and extortion charges. They are apparently Gypsies. The incident occurred in May 2007. The girl, now 15, is now claiming that Baker Molested her. After the video was made, the Gypsies presented it to Baker and demanded blackmail money.</p>
<p>Over a two year period, the Gypsies collected $250,000 from Baker, who is a very wealthy man.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Baker wanted to put a stop to it, so he went to an attorney, Richard Berman of Fresno (I don’t know this guy) and told him about the blackmailing. Apparently due to mandatory reporting laws, Berman was obligated to report Baker’s having sex with the 13 Year Old Girl to the police.</p>
<p>After an investigation, Baker was arrested by Fresno police on charges of Having Sex With a Child Under the Age of 14 (otherwise known as Child Molesting ). His bail was set at $500,000. Baker easily posted $50,000 of that and was released 8 days ago.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The article also details many allegations against Baker and it would seem that the author of the blog is someone local to the area who may have been in a position to hear the local whispers.  Now, <strong>being that there is no &quot;M.&quot; middle initial mentioned in that post, I wanted to find out whether we are dealing with a name coincidence or a legitimate lead.</strong>  I then started searching Harry Baker and quickley turned up <a href="https://www.sierrastar.com/news/article87806422.html">an article from the Sierra Star detailing Harry Baker\'s death</a>.  The article first states that Baker <em>died</em> in a hospice while awaiting trial:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Harry H. Baker, Jr., 87, president of Sierra Telephone Company, died shortly after 2 a.m. April 3, in a Fresno hospice facility.</p>
<p>Baker, a long time business leader, supporter of education, former county supervisor, and philanthropist to numerous causes, schools, and organizations, had been hospitalized since March 10, after suffering a serious stroke in the Fresno County jail. He was transported to Community Regional Medical Center, and was transferred to a hospice facility early last week. He had been in jail since Sept. 24, awaiting trial for one count of committing lewd and lascivious acts with a female minor.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Towards the end of the article, the blackmail situation is also mentioned:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;After his arrest, Baker said he was the victim of a blackmail-extortion scheme when the then 13-year-old, and her 27-year-old female cousin, secretly videotaped him, and tricked him into touching her. Baker knew the girl and her parents, and he maintained his actions were not sexual in any way, although he said he had paid a total of $250,000 to various members of a Gypsy family, who demanded the money to keep the tape from being released to authorities. It was Baker, and <strong>then attorney Richard Berman, who took a copy of the video to authorities.</strong>&quot; </p>
</blockquote>
<p>So now we have Richard Berman transporting child pornography as result of his client, Baker, wanting to turn himself in to the authorities.  But still...no &quot;M.&quot;  
</p>
<p>Next, I tried to dig into Richard M. Berman and pursue the connection from the other end.  Would there be an information connecting Judge Berman to California?  Of course there was.  Here is an excerpt from <a href="https://www.pli.edu/faculty/hon.-richard-m.-berman-1809">Judge Berman\'s profile on The Practising Law Institute</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;In 1978, he became General Counsel to Warner Cable Corporation (and to MTV Networks Inc. in 1984). In 1986, he became a member of LeBoeuf, Lamb, Greene &amp; MacRae and served as managing partner of LeBoeuf Lamb’s Los Angeles office from 1989 to 1991.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>After having read the earlier mentioned posts about Baker and his wealth and ties to the communications industry, I did get a little spine-tingle when reading that Berman was general counsel to the Warner Cable Corp AND in Los Angeles during the late 80s and early 90s communications boom.  <strong>I want to be super logical here and state that while it is possible Berman could have know Baker back then, this does not rule out that we <em>could</em> still be dealing with two different Richard Bermans.</strong></p>
<p>My gut, on the other hand is telling me they are one in the same.  Ancillary to all of this, we know that the brother Bronfman, Edgar Jr., was also heavily involved with Warner and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edgar_Bronfman_Jr.#Warner_Music_Group">sold Warner Music Group to Access Industries</a>, which is owned by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Len_Blavatnik">Leonard Blavatnik</a>, a British knight, one of the wealthiest men in London, and friend-of-a-friend-of Putin\'s.  So there is a slight Russia connection there, plus the obvious fact that Bronfman Jr.\'s family were the funders of NXIVM and Keither Raniere.  <strong>Oh yeah, and then there\'s always Time Warner\'s suspect pedo-swhirl logo which, no matter the context in which it pops up, will always scream to us &quot;KEEP DIGGING!&quot;</strong>  And finally, I also have this other unverified connection between Bronfman Sr., Bronfman Jr., Seagrams, and Epstein.  <strong>A <a href="https://twitter.com/LokiJulianus/status/1148385755343065088">twitter post from user LustLoki posted on July 8th</a> claims that Epstein left Bear Stearns under mysterious circumstances involving a deal with Seagrams.</strong></p>
<p>In conclusion, the objective of this post is to share what I found regarding Judge Berman and Harry Baker and <strong>to get help from all of you in finding solid evidence that would confirm that the Richard Berman associated with Harry Baker is indeed Judge Richard &quot;M.&quot; Baker presiding over the Epstein Trial.</strong>  Specifically, I would feel comfortable making this leap once we turn up some court documents containing the names &quot;Harry Baker&quot; AND &quot;Richard <strong>M.</strong> Berman.&quot;  <strong>For this I turn to all of you.  Once we find this we can start a movement to have Judge Berman to recuse himself from this case.</strong>  Thanks in advanced!  Peace.</p>',

           After having read the earlier mentioned posts about Baker and his wealth and ties to the communications industry, I did get a little spine-tingle when reading that Berman was general counsel to the Warner Cable Corp AND in Los Angeles during the late 80s and early 90s communications boom.

           And finally, I also have this other unverified connection between Bronfman Sr., Bronfman Jr., Seagrams, and Epstein.

           </p>

            I will be digging and see if we can confirm that we are dealing with the same judge.
