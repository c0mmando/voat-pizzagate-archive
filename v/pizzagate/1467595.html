            Indeed. Not to pick on the weird artsy uneducated sexual minority again, but how else could JA be so useful popular and supposedly powerful among the wealthy and corrupt in DC?  He certainly seems to do well for a small restaurateur.
           </p>

            Alternative hypotheses: best pizza on earth? Really big penis and eager to please?

            More likely he is useful inways that escape casual scrutiny. 
Reminded of the Facebook picture from his foreign ex's (Oliver miller, Berlin) ping pong joint, "dr pong,"  showing bundled USD stacks being removed cut out of  a teddy bear. Teddy looked like he had $10k+ in his tummy...

             Don't forget the events they host. It also could be a place where major money laundering occurs through connecting customers to the selling of paintings (which can go for tens of thousands of dollars).
            </p>
            <p>
             Example: Customer finds Alefantis after hearing Comet has the best "pizza" in town. Alefantis instructs the customer to come Saturday when they are having an event at 7:30 PM and to buy one of the paintings for sale for $10K. Abramovich or whoever the fuck they are using at the time pockets half, gives the rest to Alefantis. Child is delivered and customer is happy. Alefantis might suggest customer throws their own "event" at Comet, charges $1K to rent out the place and bring his pedo friends.
            </p>
            <p>
             Many criminals use a legit business as a way to meet customers for their illegal business. In that case, it too would be considered money laundering.

               I was giving you a scenario to answer about your doubt that a pizza place could launder serious amounts of money.
              </p>

               Honestly, how many pizza places have your heard of that host large events like this? Or are hosting paintings? Much more than a pizza shop...

                 It includes  transactions used to disguise the real intent of the transaction. You might want to think this through a little more.

                  I know what money laundering is, and have no doubt that it is a big part of this.  I do not believe that the pizza places are where the money is being laundered, however.  They simply could not launder huge amounts through a small pizza place.

              How much, seriously, can a pizza place launder?

             Now that is an interesting question. Alefantis has a farm. Perhaps that is also in this operation? he can easily launder non existent expenses as production for ingredients. He can also expense this operation on his taxes too.
            </p>
            <p>
             Perhaps this is for small cash laundering? Or a means to move money into a campaign? The white house did spend a fuck load of money on "pizza and hot dogs", so perhaps that was laundered in?
            </p>

             It is an avenue of investigation. If it turns up a dead end, then we know it is one less place to look. this is helpful in this labyrinth of rabbit holes that we are in.

              To the best of my knowledge, no one has produced any proof that Alefantis owns a farm.  If you have, please do share.

              The WH kitchen does not allow foods it has not provided the ingredients for...a security measure.

              Obama has had several themed parties where he has had chefs fly in from around the country, though.
