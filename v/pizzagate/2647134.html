             Since the reports were released yesterday, 15 people have contacted police. Some are victims and others are former staff members.

             An obituary in the British Medical Journal on January 31, 1976, stated Dr Milner was born on June 26, 1909, and educated at Wakefield Grammar School and Leeds University, graduating with honours in 1933. He gained his medical doctorate there in 1939.

            <p>
             Aston Hall hospital began in 1925 as a hospital for people with learning disabilities, but it later became a treatment centre for children with learning disabilities and mental health issues. Children in care from across the country were placed there by local authorities, both for long-term treatment and weekend care.
            </p>
            <p>
             More than 50 local authorities sent children to Aston Hall and lawyers believe there could be thousands of victims.
            </p>
           </blockquote>
           <p>
            What were the grounds for sending children there? Why did Milner travel to O'Hare's care home to meet her before she was sent to Aston Hall?

            <p>
             Another said she woke with her hands bound after being drugged, and complained to a nurse of soreness between her legs. The nurse slapped her around the head and told her she must have a urine infection.

            “The truth is we were human toys”.  Dr. Mengele alive and well in UK !!!
Daddy called her a liar ....  if our very own parents don’t listen and act on the side of caution that leaves no one to protect 
Our young and vulnerable .  The doctor was sick evil, he had a silent/ cooperative team for just a few poultry dollars .  I believe our life n earth is evil with just a few rays of sunshine. ☹️

            False Memory Syndrome Found founder Peter Freyd - Sexual Abuse Allegations
           </p>
           <p>
            Freyd and his wife Pamela founded the False Memory Syndrome Foundation in 1992,[3] after Freyd was accused of sexual abuse by his daughter Jennifer.[3][4] Freyd denies the accusations.[5]
           </p>
           <p>
            According to a statement made by William Freyd, his brother and Jennifer Freyd's uncle, Freyd and his wife Pamela grew up in the same household as step-siblings.[6] Freyd's brother added that, in his view, "The False Memory Syndrome Foundation is designed to deny a reality that Peter and Pam have spent most of their lives trying to escape," and that he was certain abuse happened to his niece.[7
           </p>
           <p>
            I remember researching this before and I posted info stating that the FMSF was started to counter act the charges of Freyd of sexual abuse against his daughter.  A way to avoid jail.  I hope to find it and post it here.   This Found.  is a Scam imo.

              As chairman of British Rail, it was Parker who brought in Jimmy Savile in as the face of British Rail in the ad campaign. Parker’s wife Lady Gillian Parker was a founder member of the British False Memory Syndrome Association. In the US the False Memory Syndrome Association has apparently been shown to have been set up by MKULTRA linked Drs. to discredit witnesses. In close association with Prince Philip, Parker was instrumental in setting up Commonwealth Conferences.

             I believe this whole case which focuses on Dr Kenneth Milner is a cover up of a more systemic MK Ultra program in the UK. Posting soon.

              Well, I finally found the piece I was looking for.
              <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_J._Freyd">
               https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_J._Freyd
              </a>
             </p>
             <p>
              Freyd and his wife Pamela founded the False Memory Syndrome Foundation in 1992,[3] after Freyd was accused of sexual abuse by his daughter Jennifer.[3][4] Freyd denies the accusations.[5]
             </p>
             <p>
              According to a statement made by William Freyd, his brother and Jennifer Freyd's uncle, Freyd and his wife Pamela grew up in the same household as step-siblings.[6] Freyd's brother added that, in his view, "The False Memory Syndrome Foundation is designed to deny a reality that Peter and Pam have spent most of their lives trying to escape," and that he was certain abuse happened to his niece.[7]
             </p>
             <p>
              Now I am certain that there may have been other reasons at play here, for starting the FMSF, with Peter and his wife truthfully believing in it's base teachings, but they also have now come up with basically calling their daughter's Memory, False.  What lovely parents.  There must have been some sick things going on in that household where Peter and Pamela grew up as well.  They were step-siblings and ended up marrying, and Peter is evidently a pedophile, so could have been abused by his father as well.  His brother also grew up in that household, so a pretty good judge of what went on within that family. Sick. Imo, Peter and Pamela are a couple of scammers.  Wriggling out of abusing his own child.  Looking forward to your post.

              What exactly do you mean by 'cover up'? To me it looks like we got a glimpse of the British MK Ultra system....

               perhaps you can have a look at this too.. the information on this link is mindblowing...here's another comment :
               <a href="https://auticulture.wordpress.com/2015/12/19/lse-the-beginnings-of-psychiatric-social-work-child-care-occult-yorkshire-11/">

               </a>
              </p>
              <p>
               As a child living in the UK and born in a particular year (1958) I was studied as part of the NCDS longitudanal study except the rest of the the 17,000 children weren’t visited by a Doctor at least every 3 months till the age of 4 as my twin and I were.
              </p>
              <p>
               I began by looking up a couple of names my mother said her mother had frequently mentioned. One was Lady Moran.
               <strong>
                I realised I was probably onto something when I discovered she was a Porton Down chemist and wife of William Sargant’s mentor – Lord Moran aka Churchill’s doctor.
               </strong>
               Lady Moran’s tutor – Joseph Barcroft was head of the Physiological dept at Porton (and an expert in inter-generational sciences and feotal development). He was also a tutor to Joel Elkes who published with MKULTRA linked Florence Bender who gave LSD to children. Elkes worked at Queens Hospital, Washington, after which he opened an LSD clinic at Birmingham University, UK – funded by the Rockefeller Institute.
Barcroft was also tutor to William Grey Walter who attended the Cybernetics Macy Conferences and by looking into those I found out about MKULTRA and realised Sargant was linked.
              </p>
              <p>
               Then I researched the village we were moved to at the age of 4 until 11, Swainswick, Bath, Somerset and discovered a neighbour is on a committee – Bath Institute of Medical Engineering meeting 3 miles away. Also on the committee were prominent Eugenicists, one of whom was a colleague of William Sargant – Erasmus Darwin Barlow, (Grandson of Charles Darwin).. (see illustration). A subsequent chairman of the BIME was Ludwig Guttmann who brought Savile into Stoke Mandeville.
              </p>
              <p>
               Lots of pieces of a jigsaw – I’ve been looking into this for 4 years now but I still want to know exactly what happened to us – the exact study, how it played out, how it may have shaped my life. There’s a lot more – my mum reportedly had a twin that disappeared at birth. My mother’s cousin (Who I’d never been aware of) was brought up “away from the family” and went on to work on the UK Space Programme. The Blue Streak and Black Knight rockets in the 60’s There’s me thinking I was just a council house kid with an unremarkable family. Fast forward to the seventies and at the age of 15 I’m a runaway working at the Athenaeum Club in Pall Mall serving previous and soon to be again Prime Minister Harold Wilson and half the cabinet.
              </p>
              <p>
               At seventeen I was briefly the recipient of unsolicited chaneled messages. My first partner/husband’s godfather was Brian Inglis who I recently discovered had started a foundation with Arthur Koestler and a chap called Instone Bloomfield. The K.I.B. Foundation – so called as it used the first letter of each of it’s founders Koestler, Inglis, Bloomfield).
              </p>
              <p>
               Bloomfield was hugely wealthy – Andrija Purharich called him my good friend Tony Bloomfield, describing him as the owner of the hotel they were staying in. Bloomfield is a member of the highly elite 1001 Club with the likes of David Rockefeller, Prince Philip and Prince Bernhardt – founder of Bilderberg. He also has a unit named after him at Guys Hospital as he donated big time. He’s pictured there at the opening of it – the first Child Guidance Centre with a teaching unit attached – the Bloomfield Clinic.
              </p>
              <p>
               There is more of this ilk too. I’ve documented pretty much everything – have it all on my computer. I can post links to verify all of the above but rather tired just now.

                 Owen was allegedly complicit in allowing Jimmy Savile access to the psychiatric hospital Broadmoor, where he (Savile) abused countless patients over a period between 1968 and 2004 (when Savile had use of a personal set of keys to the hospital). According to The Daily Telegraph, Savile’s “involvement at Broadmoor was rubber-stamped in 1974 by Dr. David Owen, now Lord Owen, who was health minister.” Thanks to Owen, Savile “came to be in charge of Broadmoor for a period in the 1980s when he was put in charge of a task force to run the secure hospital.

               <p>
                Broadmoor was the institution were Kenneth Milner worked before he went to Aston Hall. Although this was two decades before Savile abused patients there, it makes you wonder what else happened there.

                It would be interesting to look at the two institutions where Milner worked before he became head of Aston Hall. Also, was he maybe involved in 'shell shock' research during the War? Or any other psych research programme?

            Asylums, reformatories, mental institutes, etc. are all prime locations for a wide variety of abuses.  Countless examples within the US alone.  Many of them have trained MK programmers on staff and they are used to "recapture" and "reprogram" subjects whose programming has started waning.  Most likely, they are given "refresher" courses while in residence.  Pretty sick.

               Yes, but as you've seen in this case, most often colleagues cover the crimes up or take part in them. From my observation, perps most often work in an environment that at least tolerates the crimes.

            <p>
             By the age of 11, she had been sent to
             <strong>
              The Cedars, a remand centre for troubled children
             </strong>
             .
            </p>
            <p>
             There, she was told that a 'very important person' was coming to see her. Thus she found herself having an audience with a bespectacled, grey-haired man in a tweed jacket 'who looked more like a geography teacher than a doctor'.
            </p>
            <p>
             Dr Milner took Barbara's hands in his as he introduced himself, then did something odd.
            </p>
            <p>
             'He started to stroke them,' she says. 'I remember feeling embarrassed because it was odd, quite intimate.'
            </p>
           </blockquote>
           <p>
            She was then taken to Aston Hall:
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             'My body ached as if it had been kicked all over. My wrists were sore. There was a pain searing up my body from between my legs. I felt damp below, as if I'd wet myself. Later I realised that I was bleeding from there.'
            </p>
            <p>
             It was her first 'treatment', yet it came to be routine. Every day ('except for Sunday. Maybe he went to church on Sundays,' she says), she alleges Dr Milner would pick a different girl to have her treatment.
            </p>
            <p>
             All the girls hated their 'treatments'; all the nurses reassured them that what they were experiencing was perfectly normal, and for their own good.

            Elizabeth Loftus of the 'False Memory Syndrome Foundation' doing damage control here is a strong indicator that there's more to be found here. Maybe MK Ultra programming.

           <blockquote>
            <p>
             And her account, disbelieved by so many for so long, yesterday gained credence when the long-awaited police report into his behaviour was released.
             <strong>
              Her account was mirrored by 142 other witness statements, all making similar claims.
             </strong>
            </p>
            <p>
             'Dr Milner played with our bodies and our minds,' she says. 'This is the validation that we were telling the truth. When you take account of how long he was there for, he abused thousands of people.
            </p>
            <p>
             For eight months in 1971, Barbara – a troubled child whose traveller mother had abandoned her, and whose father willingly handed her over to care system when he failed to cope – was a patient in the Laburnum Ward at Aston Hall in Derbyshire, a psychiatric hospital.
            </p>
            <p>
             <strong>
              Dr Milner was Aston Hall's chief physician from 1947 to 1975.
             </strong>
             He died in 1976, decades before the first lurid accusations about the place emerged.
            </p>
            <p>
             What went on at Aston Hospital during the 50s, 60s and 70s has long been a matter of speculation. Murmurings about sinister goings-on started to be heard several years ago, and the local paper in Derbyshire first reported the incredible claims.
            </p>
            <p>
             Dr Milner played with our bodies and our minds. This is the validation that we were telling the truth
            </p>
            <p>
             Questions were eventually asked in Parliament, and then prime minister David Cameron agreed that there must be an investigation.
            </p>
            <p>
             It was Barbara who started the ball rolling.
            </p>
            <p>
             'People thought I was nuts,' she reveals. 'My solicitor has since told me that at first he thought I was a crank. The minute you say 'mental institution', people do.
            </p>
            <p>
             <strong>
              'That's how Dr Milner got away with it for so long. He used to use the phrase 'mental defectives' to describe us, as a cover for his evil.
             </strong>
            </p>
            <p>
             'The truth is we were human toys. We were a piece of meat for someone to play with, behind closed doors. And this man – this monster – was supposed to be protecting us.'
            </p>
            <p>
             Barbara's isn't a sole voice. As soon as she started tentatively speaking out, she was approached by other former patients of Aston Hall. She still believes many more victims could come forward.
            </p>
            <p>
             <strong>
              'I think what we are talking about here is the tip of the iceberg. We are not talking a handful of cases, we are talking systematic abuse in the 50s, 60s, 70s. We are potentially talking of hundreds of children, being drugged without consent and abused.'
             </strong>

            This bastard was part of a team conducting experiments on these kids. He did what was called ‘narcosanalysis’ by injecting them with sodium amytal or dosing then with ether and victims describe waking up ‘sore between the legs’.

            More disturbing is that this drugging of children was also used to implant false memories into victims which tore families apart on the basis of later accusations of familial abuse.  It’s notable that the investigation into Aston Hall has been ongoing since 2016 but only hitting MSM now and the ever so eminent Professor Elizabeth Loftus pops up to caution against the dangers of believing claims made by such victims, which makes me wonder whether this is part of a pre-emptive strike against any allegations  to emerge anytime soon?  Wouldn’t surprise me.

             Elizabeth Loftus of the 'False Memory Syndrome Foundation', likely founded and run by the CIA comes out of the woodwork....interesting.

             This could be huge, and needs some further digging.
