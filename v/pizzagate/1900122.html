            Right, but that doesn't explicitly prove it was Seth Rich. Plus we've already had a few topics going over the Dacey e-mails before this article came out.

             But it basically proves it was an insider and not Russia, unless Russia had someone on the inside which I doubt.

              Right. I don't get the feeling that that's what Jones or Corsi were setting out to prove though. The article title is about Rich being the leaker. I also seem to recall Jones claiming last week that Corsi had "proof from high level sources" that Seth was the leaker, but I'm not seeing that in any of his three articles.

               Yes as always there's no direct proof, it's all circumstantial. But I mean we still get something, it pretty much proves that Russia did not hack the DNC and the Russian story is BS like we already know. It's just a matter of getting the MSM to drop it.

             I'm still very skeptical about this being covered by Infowars though. Keep in mind that Alex Jones attached his name to Pizzagate a few months ago, then quickly apologized and backed off. The media used his apology to try to further prove that Pizzagate was "debunked." Considering the pressure they're already putting on media figures (like Hannity), I wouldn't be surprised if Jones gets pressured into apologizing for this too.

            Also, Corsi doesn't appear to have said anything that we don't already know. His main evidence is 1) Assange's August 9, 2016 interview where he implied Rich was the leaker and 2) the apparent coverup by the WPD and DNC. There's no solid
            <strong>
             proof
            </strong>
            in here that Rich was the leaker.
