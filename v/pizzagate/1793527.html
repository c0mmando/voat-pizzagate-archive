            I dislike Cernovich because he wants to out one of the Jane Does raped by Jeffrey Epstein. I am also wary of Robert Steele for his pro-Rothschild comments and calling people "pedo-lite" as if that is a thing. Most everyone else I am cool with.  I don't get the drama around David Seaman. He is Jewish and has a patreon, so what? George Webb provides some very useful info.  Even if we assume the worst he would only be a limited hangout. That just means don't expect the full picture from him. But I'm hardly convinced that he isn't genuine.

            But as you said, it is about the truth not the personality behind it.

            Webb has gone goofy and started with this retarded reality 'TV style , knocking on people's door that he is supposedly investigating. In other words, George Webb is likely a fraud. Never forget, He is and will always be a SPOOK.

            Thought I would just mentifon that Gwen has flipped and now says George Webb is not a honeypot and that the real evil is William Craddick.  She is flat out nuts.

            Upvoat. If you do not understand what Webb is talking about you are behind. He is at the scene of the crimes. He is talking about pizzagate directly. Young girls/boys brought to elite parties for sadist sexual abuse then ritually killed.,Their bodies have been found all along I-85 in New York where he is.

             Webb is a fraud. Have you seen his latest videos? In the dinner?,  at the supposed ciminals house?..At the mkutra capital? ..Webb has got comfortable, and now looks like reality TV, which makes him a fraud. All that and he is an obvious SPOOK yo boot.

            Some of his info on Shannon Gilbert is not what I've read as her mother was murdered by her daughter (Shannons half sister) who was charged and she was schizophrenic and in a paranoid state when she did it. The doctor is shady, why did he call shannons mother and deny it? Shannon Gilbert didn't use a limo company. She had a driver (Asian guy) she paid to take her out to her calls and wait for her. The fact that her 911 calls (2) were never public is very telling. She never died in a pool either. It was a marsh behind the doctors house and her purse, phone, clothing was all there. The autopsy said it could be natural causes but that there was some damage to her throat, neck which I take to mean she was strangled. This case is very strange and definitely some higher up folks involved because they keep covering up her murder.

            I'm not sure we are so desperate for real leads that we need to post everything Webb says. If he offers proof, or sources besides his own mouth, that's different. He has said questionable things in the past and many here are suspicious of him. Perhaps a separate sub for those who like this drama he is doing, but I don't think it warrants posting here.

           <p>
            2 down votes for asking for actual sources, whilst another commenter here already points out that Webb got some facts wrong. But we just worship personalities around here, not facts. So downvote away.

              this makes me want to cuss. Which posts, please? Let's get them resubmitted. THIS IS NOT OK.

              I'm thinking we should really make a Steemit highlighting the subjects that are being suppressed. What do you think?

              V___Z is a complete shill. Look at past comments and the pattern of accounts that they reply to, get replies form, like in this thread with HollandDrive, very clear patterns with V___Z.  Also notice how they use the term 'we'.

               You STILL haven't answered me. You hound Becki Percy, saying you suspect she too is a liar, and I have asked you twice now, do you really believe she is acting in her videos? That she just wanted to be famous? That's what you imply. You don't answer me directly, or at all, you just continue to bad mouth me form behind your silly bot.

              <p>
               You never linked me that video that was suppose to prove me wrong, did you? You watched two of his videos, as you've stated, and decided that he's full of shit. You still follow his posts and in every single one you comment and say vaguely how no one can trust him.

                I told you already, and this is the last time. Out of the hundreds of Webb videos, no I cannot possibly link to the one I saw, but I have mentioned his promise of a million dollars for anyone tweeting this certain hashtag, and others here remember that too. They often chime in with more and more absurd stuff. I am not alone in my feelings about Webb.
               </p>
               <p>
                I also caught him in a lie and was not impressed with his response. Because of his reputation and supposed time with the CIA, I figured he was very careful with his words and conveying truth. Therefore he would correct himself in a responsible way if he told an untruth.
               </p>
               <p>
                Someone here told me that he called David seaman "disinfo" in one of his videos. I have heard all of David's videos, and he has not put out any misstatements. I was surprised to hear that a respected fellow researcher/YouTuber would say such a thing when it was not true. I knew that I hadn't missed something that George caught - I see every one of David's videos and I know the pizzagate story pretty well. David has been spot on and hasn't led us astray even once.
               </p>
               <p>
                So I asked Webb about this on Twitter, what had David said that was disinfo? That's a pretty serious accusation and webs channel has a pretty big audience, making this statement even more serious.
               </p>
               <p>
                Webb brushed it off, didn't try to defend himself, just said "oh, I should have said "distraction""
               </p>
               <p>
                I asked him if he would correct himself in another video, as opposed to a reply to a tweet where only a few will see the correction. He ignored me.
               </p>
               <p>
                The difference between "disinfo" and "distraction" is ginormous. The lack of retraction agregious. Webb is trying to fuck up our investigation and hand out little tidbits of essentially meaningless information to what he knows is a hungry audience not well versed in psyops.

                 Now give us the proof.

                 This isn't for me, this is for us.

                <p>
                 As a closing, I'll say this: the problem I had with you is that you show up over and over and just say vague shit like "He has said questionable things in the past and many here are suspicious of him." Well, that's great and all, but who exactly is "many" referring to here? Not going to prove that? You've dropped the Gwen thing as far as I can tell, and refuse to revisit that. How about you speak to that too.
                </p>
                <p>
                 There's so many holes in your reasoning, and the fact that I'm trying to pull you away from focusing on individuals while you stare at missing tiles and scream about them is literally just making me think you're here to bring people back around to cpp while you discredit people that are putting in hard work. Whether you want to believe big contributors are slowly leading us to nothing or not, these people have still provivded a helping hand in spreading awareness. If you're here to help these kids, that should be good enough to you, and it shouldnt' matter quite so much what their motives were in the begninng of this investigation. We should be focused on the positive value individuals bring to us that are small players in this game (even if they have loud voices, they're small players) and not try our hardest to disprove things they say and as a result ruin their ethos so they can't be a viable source in the future (which is what it seems like you're doing).
                </p>
                <p>
                 Come on man, this shouldn't be personal. Like I've said before, the exact thing that companies like shareblue or media matters
                 <em>
                  don't
                 </em>
                 want us to do is work together. When people like yourself come in here and drive wedges between people because you believe large contributors to the investigation to have weird personal ties to small parts of things, you're not helping us.
                </p>
                <p>
                 Let me put it plainly for you and anyone else that may be following this: the people making big contributions to this investigation all have dirt on them, and that can/will be revealed with time. The fact that you focus on these basic little things that don't actually affect the spread of awareness in any negative fashion indicates to people like me that you're distracting us and don't want us to believe what they're saying. You're taking away from the positive impact these people have by focusing too hard on the negative things they could potentially have done. They don't have the same political influence or economic influence that someone such as George Soros, the Clintons, CIA operatives, or other individuals involved with this.
                </p>
                <p>
                 There's a huge difference between the negative impacts that the Clintons, for example, have made, and the ones that you're accusing Webb or Jones of. They are different because Jones and Webb are limited to having participated in CIA shit, as per your theory, and the Clintons, Rothschilds, Royal families, etc. are actively practicing occult worship, ritual child sacrifice, and child trafficking.
                </p>
                <p>
                 It only takes a moron or a shill to equate those two things. Your time will be better spent in other places if your only intention is to focus on the missing tiles in Webb's or Jones' cases, because the missing tiles in the Clinton's, Bush's and Podesta's cases is what brought us here - since they're the big players.

                  What your missing is V____Z's fundamental philosophy of his relationship to his fellow VOATer's. If translated without concern for the impression it might actually make on the reader, it would look something like this.
                  <em>
                   I am more clever and more moral than you, which means I am more capable of discerning who or what is important. If I believe someone is suspect, they obviously are. If you believe someone is suspect, and I don't, they are not. I am more entitled to voice opinion on any particular matter because this is my forum, because I've built up an impressive amount of submission and comment votes in a very short time. If you believe in me and follow my lead in bringing down Jones and Webb, all will be made right again.
                  </em>
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  Everything V____Z writes oozes with this attitude. He equates elevating his submission points with elevated legitimacy, and it's an illusion he'll keep playing to for reasons which one is free to speculate.

                    Even though you’ve been here longer than me, it appears you do not know how Voat works. Allow me the privilege of explaining.
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    Voat is an uncensored open forum. Under frequently asked questions, Voat says:
                    <strong>
                     While we don't necessarily approve or agree with all content that users submit to Voat, our policy is to not meddle and not censor content unless said content is illegal in the United States.
                    </strong>
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    In other words, Voat not only lets uncensored comments be posted, they aggregate those comments so other users can read them and respond.
                    <strong>
                     There is no Voat rule that one cannot peruse a member's previous comments and respond to them if inclined.
                    </strong>
                    You are just as free to peruse my comments and respond whenever you’re inclined. In fact, I’d encourage you to do so.
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    You've alluded to me following you before. If I were responding to a significant number of your posts, say half, quarter, or even a tenth of them, you might have a point, but you’ve made some 1600 Voat posts, and I’ve responded to perhaps 15 of them, meaning I’ve responded to just .9% of your posts. In other words, 99.1% or the vast majority of your posts are not responded to by me. Of the .9% of posts I've responded to, all were in measured response to your ceaseless efforts to malign Alex Jones and Infowars, and by logical extension, all of his guests.
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    A while back, you and I reached a tacit agreement on Jones. See here:

                     https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1774072/8692558/10#8692558
                    </a>
                    You were exasperated that I had the nerve to continue to answer to your attacks on Jones in spite of your protestations. In distress, you explained the impossibility of being able to stop talking about him, and presented a specific case indicating necessity. I explained my desire was not to ruin you the way you want to ruin Jones, but merely to ensure Jones is not unreasonably slandered and vilified.
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    I proved same when you accused me of downvoting. I told you I was keenly listening to the video and could find no reason to object to your thread or your remarks of that moment. And in further good faith I elected not to challenge several remarks you made about Jones in the days thereafter, because they struck me as being reasonable. But since you are a person who has no honor, you kept dialing up your attacks until I was forced to begin responding once again. When I resumed countermeasures, they were proportional, perhaps even restrained, but you seem unable to appreciate my restraint.
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    You have virtually no respect for your fellow Voat members who have told you time and again to focus on more important matters. Therefore, you must suffer the consequences, which are not all that harsh really. The consequences of blindsiding Jones at the drop of a hat merely consists of having your posts answered in a way you do not appreciate. If you cannot deal with the consequences, you need to stop the blindsides. It’s very simple.
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    My reciprocations will cease when you step back to a more reasonable posture on Jones, as you did those first few days after our last exchange in the thread noted earlier. Unlike you, I am an extraordinarily reasonable person who plays fair, and I am perfectly capable of distinguishing fair play from malice. Rest assured, I have no intention of responding to any of your posts just because you reference Jones in a journalistic way as you did in the thread noted previously. Bear in mind, when I respond to you, I am not speaking just for myself but also on behalf of

                     and realised seemed they have a done a bloody good job already. I try and avoid replying to people who hate on others here claiming to be "more woke" or better "pizzagaters" I mean Jesus people we are supposed to be a team. Working together. Sometimes we have a difference on opinion. That's ok. It's normal. It is what makes us human. But please can we have a collective consciousness of love, peace and positivity. THEY ARE WATCHING OUR EVERY MOVE.  I was a little upset at rwb for putting so much time and effort into people hating on AJ but now I understand it is for the people who haven't been researching this and closely connected conspiracies for years and years. Alex Jones does have valid points and is still going full force on the peadophile establishment. He has spent 20+ years fighting our cause and opening our eyes. He got a lawyer and was advised to back off from the JA narrative. I respect and understand why he did that. Now can we please be kind to each other.

                     Just like to add an amen to that in hopes everyone realizes killing the messengers is exactly why we are here in the first place. Whether that be Jones or Webb or many of us who many of you have no idea are actually messengers. Witnesses and victims alike that have been persecuted &amp; prosecuted. Have seen unspeakably tradegedy. Listen to the messengers each has their part to share and we all want this evil stopped. Thx

                   Since I've never actually stated my opinion yet (at least I hope... this would look foolish if I have, and that I could concede), I'll just say this:

                   My opinion on different people and different theories has varied a lot during my stay here. I think any rational person should have a similar experience. Hell, maybe I'm just gullible...
