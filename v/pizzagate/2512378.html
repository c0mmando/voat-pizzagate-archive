            I'd say 3 because it won't load, and because 1 has ugly legs and 2 is too young.

            there are many more where that came from, and they are not child porn. think i can't read laws? think i don't know the miller test? i argued for keeping pizzagate on voat when it was still freshly being imported from reddit, because i support free speech. if you use voat, than you should support free speech too, that is what this site is about. its not about justice, its not about politics, its not about happy feelz, it is about freedom of speech.

            I don't think it was Voat, since the link is still there. If you make your own subverse and play around with the buttons, you'll find that neither mods nor O's have the ability to edit other people's posts. They can remove comments and whole threads, but all that does is move them to the Removal logs. They stay on the site. Atko (Voat founder) and PuttItOut (Voat CEO) would be the only ones who might be able to tamper with the text of posts, and I've never heard of that happening on Voat.
           </p>
           <p>
            More likely, postimg.cc got a DMCA takedown request from the copyright holder of that image and was forced to remove it, causing your link to break. This happened to many archived Pizzagate images in the early days on slim.g, Facebook and some of the archive sites. The sites were hit by Podesta and Alefantis' lawyers.
           </p>
           <p>
            Interestingly, right after Q posted that picture last week, Voat went down, and he
            <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/v/pizzagate/2510124">
             later affirmed
            </a>
            it was because
            <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/v/pizzagate">
             v/pizzagate
            </a>
            was "Over the target."
           </p>
           <p>
            Just five minutes after responding to the query about Voat, Q replied to his own post, saying
            <a href="http://i.imgs.fyi/img/35b6.png">
             "This door will be opened later"
            </a>
            .
           </p>
           <p>
            It's possible that your original post about this picture over a year ago was too soon for the Swamp Draining plan, and white hats killed the photo on postimg. You may recall that a number of people were talking about pizzagate early on and then suddenly stopped, including:

             Very good observation. You are correct about the sudden silence. Ben Swann was another that buttoned up.  I am hoping that was the case instead of someone able to tamper with the pic.  I lost so many pics on Sli, which leads me to think maybe White Hats shut that down as well.  I know there were many pics that were damning to DS.  Thank for your reply.  I don’t need any more paranoid episodes than I already have zooming in and out of my brain.

              Yep, Swann is another to add to the list. Probably Cernovich, too, but I wouldn't call him a whitehat.

              I try to zoom out and look at the overall pattern. Having worked as a writer, I recognized the outline of a communication campaign when I saw the food code post on 4chan. Looked to me like a "nudge" to get the diggers going in the right direction. Plus Wikileaks kept tweeting specific emails, as well. There was massive buzz as each new revelation was discovered, then Trump won and suddenly everyone starts to shush (except Webb, Crokin, Seaman, Steele, and Judicial Watch). Then Shareblue seemingly takes over the narrative with the Comet shooter, Russians, Trump Whitehouse in disarray etc. while the sealed indictments mount into the five figures and the resignations start coming by the score. Someone definitely has their hand on the tiller.

             Using DCMA is a very common tactic for getting rid of anything unsavory.  Lawyers send a cease and desist letter to the ISP.  It takes 2 minutes for them to remove and cost nothing in attorney fees.  It's the path of least resistance.

            Voat have had some crashes and rapid development. I wouldn't be surprised if some random content is now and then lost from the database. As long as they're not systematically deleting things, I wouldn't be concerned.

            Was this the link to the image removed? Because the old image hosting site we used the most often back then was taken down. Do you remember? It was something like sl.img. If it was that site, it would make sense.

            But... you said absolutely nothing at the time, about the image being apparently removed?
           </p>
           <p>
            Do you mean someone edited your submission to remove the link, or, did the link suddenly not work? The only edit to the submission, was made 36 seconds after it was posted.
           </p>
           <p>
            If the image was removed from it's original location, it may be bad guys scrubbing it... Nothing to stop you uploading to

            the moment you noticed it was gone after voat came up after the outage, though - which would have helped to test if it was being scrubbed.

              Voat was down recently so I couldn’t look for my old post. When Voat came back up, I found the post and the picture was some how removed since posting. The pic was not removed at time of posting, but later. Somebody did not want that pic out for peeps to see. I used PostImg for old post and I used PostImg today to post pic with Spirit Cooking pic. The site was working fine in both instances. Also, the day Voat came back up PostImg was working fine, but pic is mysteriously gone.  What concerns me is you work hard on research and some asswipe is going behind our backs deleting key evidence when it is suppose to be archived.  As you can tell by old comments on the post, people could see the pic just fine so no bad link. Just fucking bullshit.
