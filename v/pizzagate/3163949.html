<p>The vlogger is going through this article from the Daily Beast: <a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/jeffrey-epstein-has-a-secret-charity-heres-who-it-gave-money-to">REVEALED: We Found Billionaire Pedophile Jeffrey Epstein’s Secret Charity</a></p>
<p>excerpts:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Through a shadowy private foundation, convicted pedophile Jeffrey Epstein has continued to shell out cash to celebrities, elite universities—and an all-girls school.</p>
<p>...But he continues to quietly distribute his wealth—including to the nonprofits of Deepak Chopra, Elton John and a doctor linked to President Trump—through a shadowy private foundation called “Gratitude America, Ltd.,” The Daily Beast has learned.</p>
<p>..Not to be confused with GratitudeAmerica, Inc., a Florida nonprofit for veterans, Epstein’s latest private foundation doesn’t appear to have a website or online presence. The only traces of the group lie in tax returns, a fundraising site for multiple sclerosis, and a book of abstracts from a 2017 academic conference in California.</p>
<p>..In 2016 and 2017, Gratitude America Ltd. funded an all-girls school in Manhattan, a youth tennis program, cancer charities, Harvard’s famous theater troupe, posh New York arts societies at Lincoln Center and the Met, and a nonprofit linked to the wife of a former Harvard president who flew on Epstein’s private jet, dubbed the “Lolita Express” by the press.</p>
<p>..Gratitude America’s biggest donations included a $375,000 payout to the International Peace Institute Inc., a New York think tank staffed by former United Nations officials and run by Norwegian diplomat Terje Rød-Larsen, and $225,000 to the Melanoma Research Alliance—both of which Epstein boasted of supporting financially in years past.</p>
<p>...In March of this year, The Daily Beast revealed Epstein had funded the nonprofit of a Russian model who advocates for women entrepreneurs.</p>
<p>And Harvard’s Hasty Pudding Institute of 1770, which includes the university’s historic theater troupe, noted Epstein among its top donors in 2018, under the category “The Guardians of the Sphinx.” .. In January 2012, “The Jeffrey Epstein Foundation” announced its sponsorship of a conference organized by MIT’s Marvin Minsky, under the headline, “Top Scientists Meet to Discuss Greatest Threats to the Earth.” In March 2012, another announcement declared, “Science Philanthropist, Jeffrey Epstein, Convenes a Conference of Nobel Laureates to Define Gravity.” It was followed days later with a different bulletin: “Jeffrey Epstein, Science Philanthropist, Organizes a Global Doomsday Conference.”</p>
<p>..Gratitude America Ltd. donated $150,000 each in 2017 to MIT and the Kuhn Foundation, run by writer Robert Lawrence Kuhn, who hosts a TV program called “Closer to Truth.” (One biography on the Chopra Foundation’s site says Kuhn is “an international corporate strategist, investment banker and expert on China” and has “a doctorate in brain research.”)</p>
<p>Epstein also funded a nonprofit that produces a TV show hosted by the wife of Larry Summers, a Harvard economist and Treasury secretary under former President Clinton.  In 2016, Gratitude America Ltd. shelled out $110,000 to Verse Video Education. The Cambridge, Massachusetts-based nonprofit produces the PBS show Poetry in America, whose creator and host is Harvard professor Elisa New. Verse’s 2016 tax return named New as the group’s president but doesn’t include specific donors for its $1.38 million in total contributions.</p>
<p>..The Crohn’s Colitis Foundation of America, which Epstein has repeatedly funded since at least 2012, received a total of $20,000 in 2016 and 2017.  Epstein also donated $10,000 in 2016 to the Women Global Cancer Initiative Inc., a nonprofit run by Next modeling agency founder Faith Kates. And he gave $10,000 to the Icahn School of Medicine at Mt. Sinai and $5,000 to the Leukemia &amp; Lymphoma Society. In 2017, Epstein gave $75,000 to the Cancer Research Wellness Institute, a California nonprofit created by a grandson of alternative-cancer treatment doctor Max Gerson, and $25,000 to Nautilus Think, a New York nonprofit that publishes a science magazine. Epstein additionally contributed $50,000 to the University of Arizona Foundation, and the Tucson research university listed Gratitude America Ltd. as a sponsor of its 2017 Science of Consciousness conference inside a book of abstracts.</p>
<p>He donated more money in 2017, with $15,000 going to “Friends of Elton John,” which appears to be the the Elton John AIDS Foundation, a charity Epstein announced funding for years before.  Gratitude America listed a donation of $50,000 to the Chopra Foundation; $60,000 to a group labeled as “Association Mind Education” in Rome, Italy; and $50,000 to the United Jewish Appeal (UJA) Federation of New York.</p>
<p>He gave $25,000 to the Film Society of Lincoln Center and $50,000 to MET Orchestra Musicians in 2017. He also donated $10,000 to a Brooklyn-based group, the Independent Filmmaker Project (Gratitude America appears to have miscalled them “Independent Feature Project” in its tax return but used IFP’s same address)...This year, Gratitude America Ltd. apparently donated to prominent litigator Stephen Susman’s fundraising page for Bike MS, a cycling event that raises money for the National Multiple Sclerosis Society. Epstein’s donation of $10,000 was the highest contribution on the website, next to another $10,000 from Susman’s wife, Ellen. (In 2017, Gratitude America noted a $5,000 donation to “Walk MS” in New Jersey that appears to be unrelated to Susman’s payout.)</p>

             Charity Linked to Sex Offender and Harvard Donor Jeffrey Epstein Gave Thousands to Hasty Pudding, Professor’s TV Show
            </a>
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             A charity connected to convicted sex offender and Harvard donor Jeffrey E. Epstein gave tens of thousands of dollars to the Hasty Pudding Institute of 1770 and a non-profit linked to a Harvard professor, according to tax filings obtained by The Crimson.
            </p>
            <p>
             Epstein served as president of a private foundation called Gratitude America, Ltd. in 2014. Gratitude America donated $50,000 to the Hasty Pudding — an umbrella organization that includes the Hasty Pudding Club, Hasty Pudding Theatricals, and the Harvard Krokodiloes — in 2016. As recently as Wednesday afternoon, the Hasty Pudding website listed Epstein as one of its 2018 donors who have given more than $50,000.
            </p>
            <p>
             In 2016, Gratitude America also gave $110,000 to Verse Video Education, the non-profit organization that funds English Professor Elisa F. New’s television show and digital initiative “Poetry in America.”
            </p>
            <p>
             Gratitude America operates out of the United States Virgin Islands, where Epstein lists his permanent address. Its 2014 filings list Epstein as the president and Darren K. Indyke and Erika A. Kellerhals as the treasurer and secretary, respectively. Tax filings from 2015 to 2017 still list Indyke and Kellerhals as employees for the charity, but Richard Kahn replaces Epstein as president.
            </p>
            <p>
             Kahn and Indyke have also worked on the boards of previous charities tied to Epstein. In addition to being Epstein’s longtime lawyer, Indyke served as vice president of Epstein’s previous foundation, the C.O.U.Q. Foundation.
            </p>
            <p>
             The Daily Beast first reported Epstein’s connections to Gratitude America in an April 16 article. The foundation has also donated to MIT, the Crohn’s Colitis Foundation of America, and Friends of Elton John, according to its tax filings.
            </p>
            <p>
             ..Before Wednesday afternoon, the Hasty Pudding listed Epstein as a 2018 “Guardian of the Sphinx,” a designation given to its highest donors — those who have given at least $50,000.
            </p>
            <p>
             Hasty Pudding Institute
             <strong>
              Chairman Andrew L. Farkas
             </strong>
             ’82 and other representatives from the Pudding did not respond to multiple requests for comment. Shortly after The Crimson reached out to the Pudding on Wednesday, Epstein’s name disappeared from, and an anonymous donor was added to, the 2018 donors page. Hours later, the 2018 page was replaced with a new list of 2019 donors, which does not include Epstein.
            </p>
            <p>
             ..The Hasty Pudding and Poetry in America initiative aside, Epstein has a long history of strong financial ties to the University. He has pledged donations of up to $30 million to individual researchers and funded the construction of the building that houses Harvard Hillel, among other contributions.
            </p>
            <p>
             Epstein also maintained an office in Cambridge for several years and forged close personal friendships with current and former faculty and administrators including Dershowitz, former University President Lawrence H. Summers, and former Dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences Henry Rosovsky.

            When Larry Summers was clintons under sec. of treasury, WE got a request from Mexico for a loan. They were broke. Congress refused. So Robert Ruben and Larry Summers got the money from, best I can remember, Clinton Initiative. They asked for a quick pay back for it. So Mexican's loans went up from say, 7% to 30%. This started the massive influx of Mexicans into America in the 90s.Alan Greenspan , in his memoirs, said he was forever an admirer of both men for their brilliance. (paraphrasing) When g bush stole the election in 2000, he further added to the "problem" by reducing funding for border patrol. America always has  a slave class. Odd to me, why people don't wonder why so many suddenly started coming here to work under horrific conditions. As president of Harvard, Summers gave them financial advice and they went from 1 billion in profits to broke. He was sent to Russia by clinton to help with their finances after the fall of the Berlin wall/communism. On his advice many small farmers in small Russian bloc countries committed suicide.....and they longed for the days of  stalin, who murdered thousands upon thousands of Russian...Summers and Rahm Emanuel owned controlling shares of two different hedge funds. ..they built a wind farm in upper state ME. ..and ran out of money.....this corporation , First Wind, was tied to Enron as they were interested in wind power. Well, they were broke and an entire wind farm was built with money from Obomba's jobs program. ...at something like a million a job. Wind farms do not help the environment, they actually hurt it. So when Trump did not sign the Paris Accord which is about Renewable Energy Credits , part of the scam, it was a very good thing. Only politicians and the filthy rich can get into that scam. Last I heard of Larry Summers, he was a serious contender for federal reserve chairman.....only public outcry keept that from happening. He and rahm emanuel bear looking into for mafia / Israeli ties and I would be very suspicious of his wife's charity or whatever.WayneMadsenReport stated that rahm and obomba were traveled in the same circles.......gay bath houses and such in Chicago.I trust Wayne Madsen's report. Obomba went after him and pretty much destroyed his career.

            Speaking of Larry Summers
           </p>
           <p>
            <a href="https://www.zerohedge.com/news/2016-10-19/hillary-clinton-linked-mysterious-front-associated-julian-assange-pedophile-smear">

            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            Yesterday, WikiLeaks put out a serious of tweets informing the public that Julian Assange had been attacked in a smear campaign pushed by a “front” group and U.S. democratic media.
           </p>
           <p>
            A front has released through US Democratic media an elaborate story accusing Julian Assange of paedophillia &amp; taking US$1million from Russia
           </p>
           <p>
            “An unknown entity posing as an internet dating agency prepared an elaborate plot to falsely claim that Julian Assange received US$1M from the Russian government and a second plot to frame him sexually molesting an eight year old girl,” WikiLeaks said in a press release Tuesday.
           </p>
           <p>
            The press release went on: “The second plot includes the filing of a fabricated criminal complaint in the Bahamas, a court complaint in the UK and laundering part of the attack through the United Nations. The plot happened durring WikiLeaks’ Hillary Clinton related publications, but the plot may have its first genesis in Mr. Assange’s 16 months litigation against the UK in the UN system, which concluded February 5 (Assange won. UK and Sweden lost &amp; US State Dept tried to pressure the WGAD according to its former Chair, Prof. Mads Andenas).”
           </p>
           <p>
            The DailyKos reported that a Canadian family holidaying in the Bahamas reported to the police that their 8-year-old daughter was “sexually molested online” by Assange on Toddandclare.com.
           </p>
           <p>
            Julian Assange’s legal team provided a timeline in the press release which showed that the self-claimed dating agency ToddAndClare.com contacted WikiLeaks’ defense team offering one million dollars for Assange to appear in a video advertisement for the “dating agency”.
           </p>
           <p>
            Assange’s defense wrote back, stating that the proposal appeared to be an “elaborate scam designed to entrap Mr. Assange’s reputation into unwanted and unwarranted publicity.”
           </p>
           <p>
            WikiLeaks was able to trace down the address of the front, posting an image on twitter of what appears to be a warehouse or garage.
           </p>
           <p>
            Here is the "headquarters" of the front (PAC?) behind the Assange "took US$1M from Russia" plot
           </p>
           <p>
            <a href="https://twitter.com/wikileaks/status/788563097657171968/photo/1">
             https://twitter.com/wikileaks/status/788563097657171968/photo/1
            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            Internet sleuths from Reddit were able to dig up some information about the dating service pushing the attacks on Assange, finding that the company shares the address with a private intelligence corporation named Premise Data Corporation.
           </p>
           <p>
            Interestingly, Larry Summers, who is connected to the Clinton Campaign, is on the board of directors of Premise Data Corporation.
           </p>
           <p>
            Here is the Reddit post that lays out the findings:
           </p>
           <p>
            <a href="https://www.zerohedge.com/sites/default/files/images/user5/imageroot/2016/10/16/Screenshot-2016-10-19-at-9.36.16-AM.png">

            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            As other Redditors point out, the Center for American Progress was founded by Clinton campaign chair John Podesta and was funded by billionaire and pro-Clintonite George Soros.
           </p>
           <p>
            I remember this Hot Item on that day being on Reddit at the time.  Blew Wide Open.  What interesting times. Larry Summers and Neera Tanden.   Wonder if this will be brought up by Assange's lawyer.   But here we have proof again that it is all connected.

             New is married to Summers, Harvard University’s former president, who hobnobbed with Epstein in elite international relations groups and, like Bill Clinton, flew on Epstein’s private jet. Vanity Fair’s 2003 feature mentions Epstein proudly displaying Summers’ letter of commitment to

              “the Epstein Program for Mathematical Biology and Evolutionary Dynamics”
             </strong>

            <p>
             The Jeffrey Epstein VI Foundation is a private science foundation known for establishing the Program for Evolutionary Dynamics at Harvard University with a $30 million gift to the university.[1]
             <strong>
              The Program for Evolutionary Dynamics is considered the first department of its kind to study the evolution of molecular biology with the sole use of mathematics.
             </strong>
             It is also one of the first departments to develop mathematical models of how human cancer cells evolve as well as infectious bacteria and viruses such as HIV.[2]
            </p>
            <p>
             The Jeffrey Epstein VI Foundation is also known for giving one of the largest amounts of funding to individual scientists around the world. Since 2000, the Foundation has given approximately $200 million a year to many notable scientists including Stephen Hawking, Marvin Minsky, Eric Lander, Lawrence Krauss, Lee Smolin, George Church, Ben Goertzel, Kip Thorne, Gregory Benford and numerous Nobel laureates, including, Gerald Edelman, Murray Gell-Mann, Gerard ’t Hooft, David Gross, and Frank Wilczek.[3] Over the years, the Foundation has convened many of these scientists in conferences to discuss the consensus on fundamental science topics such as gravity, global threats to the Earth and language.

Certainly, you won’t find Epstein’s transactions written about on Bloomberg or talked about in the trading rooms. “The trading desks don’t seem to know him. It’s unusual for animals that big not to leave any footprints in the snow,” says a high-level investment manager.  ...

               btw, all these people have suspicious backgrounds. shadey guy in politics? look at his/her family. i've taken to doing this with all of them. bc let's face it, everyday people don't get into positions of power. and we all know it's not what you know it's who you know. generally i see either a person with a family background in military, law (judges), or financing. shocking right? and for the ones whose parents ran a paint store off main street in noname town usa- bullshit. gotta know someone, somehow. epstein is especially suspicious. goes from dropping out of volege to teaching high school math to wall street trader by 25 to running his own company 5 years later. as i, the great judge jewdy says, if it doesn't make sense it isn't true. and the links can generally be traced back through family connections. for every damn one of them.

             <p>
              After he left government, Comey spent three years being grilled, or “probed,” as an executive at Bridgewater Associates.. It looks like James Comey basically worked for Bridgewater before he worked in the FBI under Obama, and Bridgewater's Associates Executive Bruce Steinberg was killed this week with his whole family in a Costa Rica plane crash. The Clinton's are actually connected to the death of Compass Group CEO Richard Cousins who also died this week along with four others in a plane crash in Australia.
             </p>
             <p>
              The Compass Group provided full-service LEED recertification consulting to the Clinton Foundation to assist them with achieving LEED-EB Platinum recertification for the William J. Clinton Presidential Library, located in Little Rock, AR. The153,779 sq. ft. William J. Clinton Presidential Library, a part of the National Archives, has been designated as one of the most energy efficient and environmentally friendly places to work in the United States by the U.S. Green Buildings Council under its Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design Green Building Program.

            What is interesting is that two of the charities he named on his tax form say they never received any money from him. Either they are lying, or he made these donations up. Which begs the question: why?

             U.N. Think Tank Opening Office In Bahrain, With Bahraini Government Funding
            </a>
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             As Bahrain enters the third year of a crisis sparked by Arab Spring protests in 2011, the government continues to bar many human rights advocatesandjournalists from entering the country. But one non-profit group is not only being welcomed into the tiny Gulf kingdom, it’s opening an office there. And it’s doing so with funding from Bahrain’s ruling monarchy. The International Peace Institute, a New York-based think tank closely associated with the United Nations, announced last month an agreement to open the office to “promote development, peace and international security.”
            </p>
            <p>
             According to the group’s 2011 annual report, its major donors that year included the United States, several governments in Europe, as well as Bahraini regional allies Qatar and the United Arab Emirates.
             <strong>
              The institute’s international advisory council includes Prince Turki Al-Faisal, the former head of Saudi intelligence.
             </strong>
             Saudi Arabia sent troops to help put down the protests in Bahrain in 2011.

            <p>
             The International Peace Institute (IPI, formerly the International Peace Academy) is an independent non-profit research and policy development institution based in New York (beside the headquarters of the United Nations, with which IPI works closely). Additionally, the Institute has regional offices in Europe (Vienna, Austria), and in the Middle East (Manama, Bahrain).
            </p>
            <p>
             IPI specializes in multilateral approaches to peace and security issues, working closely with the Secretariat and membership of the United Nations.[3][4] IPI's primary objective is to promote effective international responses to new and emerging issues and crises through research, analysis, and policy development.
            </p>
            <p>
             Since 2005, IPI has been led by Terje Rød-Larsen, a principal architect of the 1990s Oslo Peace Accords (between the PLO and the Government of Israel) and a Norwegian sociologist and diplomat who has served the UN as its senior envoy in the Middle East.[6]
            </p>
            <p>
             IPI today focuses its work on crisis and the response capacity of international institutions, UN reform, statebuilding/peacebuilding, and has specific regional programs on the Middle East, Africa, and Asia. Rød-Larsen serves simultaneously as the UN Secretary General's Special Envoy for the Implementation of Security Council Resolution 1559.
            </p>
            <p>
             Current Officers: Chairman of the Board of Directors: Kevin Rudd, Former Prime Minister &amp; Labor Party leader, Australia; Vice President: Adam Lupel; Senior Director of External Relations: Mary Anne Feeney

                 Maxwell even dreamed that he might one day forge an alliance with the Kennedys by marrying Ghislaine to JFK Jr. The two became close friends and remained so until Kennedy’s tragic death last year. Ghislaine has also been a guest at a number of Kennedy weddings and family events.

                  LOL the Jewish control of the UK is the most well-documented of all, Bank of England one of the earliest and the most important Jewish-run central banks.  The Jewish PM Disraeli wrote entire novels laughing at how stupid we are for not seeing the Jewish control.
