<p>A baseless conspiracy theory once again shot to prominence on YouTube this week with top search results for “Tom Hanks” including several videos accusing the actor of being a pedophile.</p>
<p>Hanks is the latest target in the ever-growing QAnon conspiracy theory, which posits that powerful figures in government and in the entertainment industry are involved in an array of horrific crimes, including the ritualistic sex abuse of children. One of the YouTube videos about Hanks, which connects him to a “deep state” effort to undermine President Donald Trump, has been viewed more than 280,000 times in less than a week.</p>
<p>A search for Cemex, a Mexican construction company, also returned several results linking the company to pedophilia based on a discredited conspiracy theory about a “child sex camp” in Arizona.</p>
<p>The search results were first highlighted by NBC News reporter Ben Collins.</p>
<p>In response, YouTube said it was continuing to develop tools to counter misinformation on the platform.</p>
<p>“We’re continuously working to better surface and promote news and authoritative sources to make the best possible information available to YouTube viewers,” a YouTube spokesperson told BuzzFeed News.</p>
<p>The spokesperson noted that YouTube has added prominent “breaking news” and “top news” sections on its website that show users content from reliable sources following major events. The company also started including links to Wikipedia articles on some conspiracy videos.</p>
<p>“This work is still in its early stages, but as these tools start to apply more widely across YouTube, we believe they will make authoritative content readily available and help address these types of results,” the spokesperson said.</p>
<p>YouTube has long been a main online hub for conspiracy theorists. One of the most prominent news channels on YouTube belongs to Alex Jones, the founder of the conspiracy site Infowars, who has claimed that 9/11 was an inside job and that the Sandy Hook school shooting didn’t happen. In February, a video falsely describing a Parkland, Florida, shooting survivor as an “actor” made it onto YouTube’s list of promoted trending videos.
Twitter / Via Twitter: <a href="https://voat.co/user/SaRaAshcraft">@SaRaAshcraft</a></p>
<p>The claims about Tom Hanks can be traced back to a single Twitter user named Sarah Ruth Ashcraft, who has been claiming for months that the actor sexually abused her as a teenager while she was under “mind control.”</p>
<p>A representative for Tom Hanks did not immediately respond to a BuzzFeed News request for comment.</p>
<p>Ashcraft has leveled similar accusations of abuse against Hillary Clinton, her own father, and several other people and organizations. She has not provided any evidence for these claims, and she did not immediately respond to interview requests sent to her social media accounts Monday.</p>
<p>Ashcraft recently boasted of having increased her Twitter follower count by 20,000 after her claims were picked up by the wider online community of QAnon conspiracy theorists. She has previously said that her accusations against Hanks and others are true because “if the things I’m saying weren’t the truth, twitter would shut down my page.”</p>

            This is why QAnon pisses me off. Q came along late to the crusade. It's not his theory that powerful figures in government / entertainment are involved in horrific crimes. That theory came directly from Julian Assange's Wikileaks DNC email drop. It's reading those creepy crawly exchanges in code, seeing the Podesta bothers porno 'art' collection, finding out about spirit cooking, and throwing kids into the pool for entertainment that formulated its own conspiracy.
           </p>
           <p>
            Fuck Q. Other than give us a series of wild goose chases to distract us from actual investigation, he's done nothing except play the pinata for the fake news media outlets.

            John S. Johnson II. We hate him in Sarasota Florida. He made this awful monstrosity right next to the bay. Perverts from around the World come here and photograph each other looking up her skirt. He was fired by his Uncle, and dismissed from his fathers will. That would be his son in buzzfeed. Racine, Wisconson is the main center of this operation. The founder of buzzfeed is Jonah Peretti, and co-founded The Huffington Post, along with Kenneth Lerer, Andrew Breitbart and Arianna Huffington in 2005.[5] He left The Huffington Post in 2011 after it was bought by AOL for $315 million. Breitbart freaked out at what he discovered, and killed himself by drinking a glass of wine and walking across the street.

              In 2013, Buzzfeed named "My Lips are for Blowing" as one of "21 Awkwardly Sexual Albums"; the Museum of Hoaxes subsequently reported there was no such album, and that the image of the album used in the Buzzfeed article had been lifted from a 2010 fictitious album cover design created by a blogger going by the name Estancia de la Ding Dong. Laugh, Dammit.

               Someone will probably think I made that up. All facts,unfortunately. Fox is not our friend. Fair weather friends in certain anchors, maybe. I understand the concept of keeping your job, and keeping your mouth shut, trust me. Everyone needs to start making insurance files with lots of copies in several locations, for quick distribution.

            I stand with Sarah. She is a beacon of light and truth for survivors and I hear her brave testimony.
