<p>BERLIN, February 28, 2020 (LifeSiteNews) — A sci-fi movie portraying a sexual relationship between a man and a robot that replicates his lost 10-year-old daughter has prompted walkouts and outrage at its screenings at the Berlin film festival.</p>
<p>The film, titled The Trouble with Being Born and directed by Austrian Sandra Wollner, stirred controversy at its February 25 world premiere at Berlinale 2020, reported the U.K. Independent.</p>
<p>It depicts a child-like android, played by 10-year-old Lena Watson (a pseudonym), who calls her owner “Daddy.”</p>
<p>While much is implied, the movie \'leaves little doubt that the man ... has a sexual relationship with the child robot,\' the Independent reports.</p>
<p>The movie also includes multiple CGI nude scenes.</p>
<p>The film evoked disgust on Twitter, with one person calling it “paedophile propaganda,” the Independent reported.</p>
<p>That was echoed by FilmGoblin in a review entitled “Pedophilia gets mainstream nod in The Trouble with Being Born.”</p>
<p>“Who are these people actually kidding?” notes the review.</p>
<p>“Let’s not pretend that this isn’t about mainstreaming the last sexual perversion — other than bestiality — that isn’t socially acceptable,” it adds. “And there’s no argument to be made in defense of the existence of this film by using the ‘Lolita’ defense, or even the ‘well it’s just a robot’ defense.”</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>Wollner told the Hollywood Reporter, which described the film as a “hidden gem,” that the role was originally intended for a 20-year-old.</p>
<p>However, she decided to cast a child after removing some more explicit elements in the script.</p>
<p>“What I found interesting about it is that we have an android whose only desires are the ones you program it to have,” she said. “I found it fascinating to show the perspective of the world through this machine that does not judge and does not care, and doesn’t need the meanings that we do.”</p>
<p>Wollner added that she was initially “scared” about choosing a child for the part and said that when she was casting for the role, she looked for a minor who came from a “healthy environment.”</p>
<p>It was also necessary that the child come from “the sort of open-minded family who would understand the story they wanted to tell and also allow them to do it,” noted The Hollywood Reporter.</p>
<p>In the end, Wollner found Watson because her parents were known by a friend of a friend.</p>

<p>An android whose deep black eyes and waxily smooth skin—evoking the eerie expressionlessness of Christiane’s face mask in Eyes Without a Face—are the very definition of the Uncanny Valley, Elli was built to replicate the father’s daughter, who disappeared 10 years before. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>…&quot;Wollner continues to fill her film with too little story....&quot;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>That problem becomes more acute once Elli runs away and the story shifts to another android-human relationship. After Elli is picked up by a passing motorist (Simon Hatzl) who then gifts her like a new toy to his elderly mother (Ingrid Burkhard), still mourning the little brother she lost 60 years before. The ease with which Elli is made into a boy—in the world of the film, reprogramming androids is about as complicated as restarting a smartphone—stands in stark contrast to the violent trauma of abuse that still lingers like a ghost in her flickeringly sentient CPU. But while the setting and the primary human character changes in the second half of the film, Wollner’s narrow view of her story means just more of the same glassy expressions and long maundering silences, like Tarkovsky without the existential pain. At some point, the mirroring begins to feel more like straight repetition without any significant revelation.</p>
<p>In the end, The Trouble with Being Born suffers from the same issue as its moody androids: enervation borne out of repetition. There are some attempts here and there to comment on the replacement of human connection with silicone facsimiles. We almost never see people together. </p>
<p>But rather than truly exploring the ramifications of its futuristic conceit, whether from a broader societal or individualistic and relational perspective, the film just keeps looping back to the same luminously filmed but ultimately blank silences.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Presumably in no small part due Sandra Wollner\'s error in believing &quot;it fascinating to show the perspective of the world through this machine that does not judge and does not care, and doesn’t need the meanings that we do.”</p>',

             That's the same argument the Paedophile Information Exchange (PIE) pedo activists have been pushing in order to justify molesting kids as a natural, victimless sexual preference

            <p>
             First you see a ten-year-old girl in Elli who spends the summer with dad at the pool. Then a storage medium for memories of the child that this dad lost ten years ago. Then a very elaborate sex toy, the special equipment of which is particularly easy to wash off - in a not too distant future, child androids can obviously fulfill various wishes from adults. With the tilting, confused, deeply strange looks it is in Sandra Wollner's "The Trouble With Being Born", a kind of "Blade Runner" for the Austrian suburbia, is far from done. The highlight of the Encounters series shows a filmmaker who is already entering her second long film into much more risky realms than the majority of German-language filmmaking can do.

             <p>
              it’s basically a film about a child-like android that can be programmed to do anything you want – all the darkest things you can imagine. And yet it just doesn’t care; it wants what it’s programmed to want...
             </p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>
             One could make that argument about filmmakers as well.  In my mind she's like an android, a product of a culture that has pedophiles projecting their desires into every form of influence that they can.  She's become so devoid of a truly human response to what is clear to the audience (this is why they walked out), that she can only approach the topic of pedophilia and child rape as an empty vessel, the child does not exist.  She projects terms like 'a point of view' and 'wants and desires' onto a fictional android, who is programmed, yet never addresses the actions and ill intent of the programmer.  She doesn't give the back story of the father who molests his daughter, and then uses a doll image of his dead daughter as a sex toy, demonstrating that he has as little regard for her humanity in death as he did when she was alive.  The daughter was not a sex toy, she was his victim, the fact that he can have sex with a likeness of her after her death makes one wonder what such a creep did to her real body after she drowned!  (That's the reality of society we live in when it comes to pedophiles and necrophilia.) The daughter's image in a doll is not value neutral, and a director presenting the story of the doll this way (dehumanizing the daughter)  is a bigger story on the state of 'virtualization of values' in our times then the end product (her movie).

              [Interviewer]:

               Even though this particular android wants, as you said, what it’s programmed to want, some still don’t seem too happy with its “performance”. Why?

             </p>
             <p>
              People aren’t happy with Elli – after all this time, I still keep referring to her as a girl – because every dialogue you can have with her, or with this object, is basically a monologue. Then again, it’s more the idea of a robot than an actual technical creation. We are not showing the latest advancements in artificial intelligence; it’s not about science fiction or what could possibly happen in the near future. I just wanted to reflect a certain aspect of our current reality. Also, when people talk about projecting their inner self onto an android and having it out there in the world forever… To tell you the truth, I find the whole concept of eternity rather unsettling. It scares me, frankly – this idea of just reliving and reliving, what would that even mean? I am not sure I am a fan of that.
             </p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>
             The story is that (a character) the ten year child is dead, her image is created to be used as a sex toy. Wollner can't see that she's created within her story an example of "just reliving and reliving" of a state of dehumanization.  She's herself is a symptom of a sick society.
            </p>
            <p>
             Wollner in her own words, is unable untangle a virtual reality, a tape recording, from life.
            </p>
            <blockquote>
             <p>
              It’s basically the story of Pinocchio, and what I was interested in was an anti-Pinocchio. I didn’t want her to have this wish to become a human, which is usually their biggest goal. Elli only wants what was programmed inside her. If she were programmed to dream about becoming a human, that’s what she would want. But that would just be cruel, and it’s obviously not happening here. I found it striking: there is this android, and she doesn’t mind if a 50-year-old man takes her to bed or if she stays with an older lady, serving as a projection of her dead brother.
             </p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>
             Neither Pinocchio nor 'anti-Pinocchio' are humans and cannot be humans (btw Wollner misses the point of the Pinocchio story entirely, a fairy tale with an evil imp character possessing a
             <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pinocchio">
              wood figurine marionette
             </a>
             and The
             <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Fairy_with_Turquoise_Hair">
              Fairy
             </a>
             with Turquoise Hair ). Unlike Wollner's Fairy tales serve more purpose than the aim of her movie does.
            </p>
            <p>
             So, reality check is needed for Wollner.  Programs don't 'want'. Yet, Wollner can't break down the obvious. Let's simplify that: a toaster can serve up toast to a pedophile just as easy as to someone who lost a sibling.  Talking about the story of either (the pedophile or the sibling) from the so called 'perspective' of the toaster is pseudo intellectualism, a mind fart.  If anything, Wollner presents a false equivalent, something that pedos and their supporters are prone to doing.
            </p>
            <blockquote>
             <p>
              I wanted to show our world from the perspective of someone who is not human, from the viewpoint of an object that doesn’t judge and isn’t trying to find the meaning of life. It just is.
             </p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>
             Objects don't have perspectives, and it's disingenuous to pretend they do in a context that dehumanizes a child victim of rape.  It only serves to protect the pedophile mindset by objectifying reality wherein they don't even have to pretend to care about the subject as having consequences on real people or a real society, any action "just is".
            </p>
            <p>
             A programmed machine does not have a perspective and Wollner deludes herself in thinking that one can, on the one hand, give a machine a 'perspective' and on the other hand, claim that there is no perspective.  There is certainly a perspective, but it's a human perspective as all movies are because movies are intended to be viewed by humans, not androids.

              I had to edit part of my comment, as I only saw the previews of the movie, and the scene of what looks like a drowned girl, and of the father carrying the drowned girl through the woods/meadow, I assumed the daughter had drowned.  Apparently she 'disappeared' but does make an appearance in the movie:

              <p>
               This is further complicated by the appearance later on of the real Elli (Jana McKinnon), an older girl who resembles the robot version, and is presumably the source of the memories that the robot repeats. And even then, Wollner and co-writer Roderick Warich’s are scarcely half done: New, knotty themes of gender identity, human fallibility, and the whispery presence of a ghost in every machine also develop.

              Great. So is the flesh and blood version of the father's perversion okay with him using a sex doll version of herself for his perversions, or are is the concept of which pronoun to use and dead naming the only objection? /s

            Not only does the movie portray pedophelia but when the girl runs away she is picked up by a motorist who gives her to his Mother as. replacement for the brother she lost 60 years ago. Tricky. It touches on transgenderism. They really want to touch all the bases. Yuck.

             Child sex dolls are already available in the world but not legal to be imported into some countries.  I would ask if people would care if someone made it look like their dead 10 year that they were molesting.  Is that where society is at, no one gives a shit what degenerate people do.  Then society is no better than mindless programmed bots.

              Giving a shit and making it illegal can be 2 different things.  If an act or item can be illegal without a damaged party, then anything can be made illegal.

               The United States Constitution does not protect freedom of expression. The courts devised that phrase and have been using it for the last 100 years to subvert a protection of
               <em>
                words
               </em>
               (freedom of speech) into a protection of
               <em>
                actions and behaviors
               </em>
               (expression).

                 Becuase it goes against the Bible's teachings and the teachings of Jesus Christ. That's what our founders based the Republic on. God's Law is the highest authority and it is man's duty to uphold it. No laws contradicting the Ten Commandments (i.e. saying you can steal your neighbor's property or kill them) or the teachings of Jesus are valid laws because they do not derive just authority from anything.

                ^^That is why it's illegal to import them in some countries, because while they don't legislate what a pedo feels, they still care enough about the children to recognize the broader societal consequences of CP in all forms and enabling the behavior/addictions. (Although in the UK that's a bit problematic and untrue considering their record of protecting elite pedos/murderers)

                 Similar for regulations around viewing CP, or
                 <em>
                  "simulations"
                 </em>
                 of CP, like cartoons, CG, comics. It's illegal in some countries to
                 <em>
                  "obtain"
                 </em>
                 or store them as polaroids or files, in other countries by viewing or searching terms, and it's largely ambiguous/unspecified in the rest of countries. I know the slippery slope argument is a logical fallacy, but this is one case where it seems pretty pressing; the more people opt for realistic depictions of child abuse via literature, drawings, computer animations, physical models, interactivity, AI, the more degraded and pertinent the lines of the crime become, and so the obligations to regulate it.
                </p>
                <p>
                 Honestly, thinking about the extent to which people increasingly simulate things in their reality, the more my mind implodes with distorted frustration &amp; confusion. I'm finding it harder to comprehend now, like I'm from an older generation despite being from the 90s.

                  In the US the simulations and cartoon depictions of CP, rape, gang rape, sex trafficking, are not regulated.  That's why parts of Voat have it and there are people here who have no issues sexting each other over this shit. (I reported it but never went back to see if anything became of it).  There comes a point where people need to wake up from their wicked ways, there's no law to babysit them into doing the right thing by condemning the sexual exploitation of kids, even in forms that they don't believe "hurt anyone".  This includes trans movement and Drag Queens.

                   There are laws against what they are doing, but they haven't been enforced in many years. Pornographic depictions are not protected under the Bill of Rights or the Constitution of the United States and were illegal in the founding era. These people are outside of the law and justly belong in prison.

                     Whorley used a computer at a Virginia Employment Commission office in Richmond on March 30, 2004, to view obscene

                     The new statute is "designed to increase protection against the sexual exploitation of minors," the U.S. attorney's office said.

                     Whorley was under court-supervised release after serving time on previous child pornography convictions when he was charged under the current indictment. Authorities said he was arrested in April 2004 after he printed out some of the obscene cartoons in the VEC office and someone noticed.

                    <p>
                     The indictment accused Whorley of 20 counts of receiving obscene materials, 20 counts of receiving obscene visual representations of sexual abuse of children, 14 counts of receiving child pornography and
                     <strong>
                      20 counts of sending

                    <p>
                     Whorley's maximum possible sentence is 1,160 years in prison and a fine of $18.5 million. Judge Henry E. Hudson scheduled sentencing for March 10.

                    <p>
                     Besides viewing the cartoons on March 30, Whorley used a VEC computer on two earlier dates in March 2004 to receive digital photographs of children engaging in sexually explicit conduct, the U.S. attorney's office said. The 20 obscene e-mail messages described, among other things, parents sexually molesting their children.

                     In January 2003, he had served his sentence and was on supervised release when he violated the terms of his probation and was taken back into custody, according to the U.S. attorney's office.

                    <p>
                     He was sentenced to an additional 12 months to serve and was released in January 2004. Whorley again violated probation and was arrested in April 2004, which led authorities to the current prosecution.

                    <p>
                     Whorley was prosecuted by Assistant U.S. Attorney Sara E. Flannery and Damon A. King, a trial attorney with the U.S. Department of Justice's Child Exploitation and Obscenity Section. The case was investigated by the FBI and the justice department.

                     "With this conviction, we have removed a dangerous repeat sex offender from the community for a long time," said Paul J. McNulty, acting deputy attorney general as well as U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia.

                     Assistant Attorney General Alice S. Fisher of the criminal division in the U.S. Department of Justice called Whorley "a relentless trafficker of child pornography."
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     She said the justice department "will continue to protect citizens from obscene pictures of child pornography by punishing those who violate our law and engage in these abhorrent offenses."

                    <p>
                     Whorley's previous conviction on federal child-pornography charges was in 1999. He was sentenced to 46 months in prison to be followed by three years of court-supervised probation.

                    All these behaviors (except for the prior convictions to our knowledge) are/were taking place on the loli cp subs on voat.  This appears to be illegal behavior (at least in Richmond Virginia).  Providing a platform for illegal behavior is a violation of voat's own rules.  I haven't checked the subs to see if anything has happened since I reported many of the posts as violating voat rules (nor do I intend to as I've seen as much of that sick shit as I can tolerate, even for reporting it.)  In addition there are subs where written cp fantasy also is posted.  I don't know if the case in Richmond is isolated but it is something to consider.

                      In Whorley's case he broke the conditions of a prior charge (he was under court supervised release and was a repeat offender regarding cp, not cartoons.). So his case involves violating probation and 14 counts of receiving child pornography, so it's unknown whether the possession of the cartoon depictions alone (without possession of cp as well) would have resulted in a prosecution.

                       Nevertheless, Handley entered a guilty plea. According to Threat Level, it was simply because his attorney had exhausted all other options:

                       "It's probably the only law I'm aware of, if a client shows me a book or magazine or movie, and asks me if this image is illegal, I can't tell them," says Eric Chase, Handley's attorney.

                      <p>
                       Chase says he recommended the plea agreement (.pdf) to his client because he didn't think he could convince a jury to acquit him once they'd seen the images in question. The lawyer declined to describe the details. "If they can imagine it, they drew it," he says. "Use your imagination. It was there."

                       Handley is the first person to be convicted under the controversial Protect Act, which makes drawings of fictional characters into potential child pornography.

                       In 2002, the Supreme Court struck down the so-called Morphing Law, which held that fictional cartoon or photoshopped images depicting minors having sex would  also be treated as obscene (Ashcroft v. Free Speech Coalition). Under that decision, last week's conviction of Handley could not have happened.
                      </p>

                       <p>
                        But in 2003, the Protect Law passed, which held that "a drawing, cartoon, sculpture, or painting" showing children in sexual situations could be ruled illegal if local community standards consider it "obscene." This is particularly relevant given that Handley was tried in an area, Southern Iowa, where average community members may not be aware of the styles and content of typical manga.

                      So 'community standards' play a part in determining the legality of the images?  How does this translate into an online community such as voat?  I would say that one could argue that the attacks of trolls and lolicon cp collectors against subs where the vast majority of users are AGAINST the images and consider them obscene, those actions, those images, could be considered illegal and one would think would be enough to get a sitewide ban of those users.  Since the 'community' of perverts that have their depicted cartoon child rape subs isolated from the rest of the voat, they could argue that the same images are legal unless those users are in possession of cp or have prior records/convictions of possession of cp.  (no way to know).  That's how I'm reading the case cited in the link.

The office in conjunction with the Southwest Missouri Cyber Crimes Task Force argued that the "Incest Comics" on Bee's computer "clearly lack any literary, artistic, political, or scientific value". Christian Bee was originally indicted for possession of actual child pornography, but that charge was dropped as part of a plea deal, and was instead charged with possession of the "Incest Comics"

                     Clark himself argued that the law led to the absurdity that he could, in theory, be convicted of possessing objectionable images of stick figures.

                    <p>
                     Clark admitted he was interested in the images but he said it was for their artistic merit and as "a bit of a laugh". He did not find them sexually arousing, he said.

                     Tavinor said there were ethical issues that complicated the case.

                     "The ways a person entertains themself is not morally negligible. This is probably an additional factor in the current case because as well as worrying about the effects these activities might have on children, we also naturally make moral judgments about the character of the person in question.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     "But for the purposes of law it is probably important to distinguish between these because convicting someone for their moral views is very dangerous."

                    The subject is further complicated by the problem of cp with real individuals that runs rampant throughout the world, sex tourism, child prostitution (all illegal)  and which loli cp porn advocates point out when justifying what they consider a legal and victimless form of sexual depictions.  So the issue speaks to that of a degenerate culture, we see the sexualizing  of children through the media and commercialism, through transgender movement/drag kids fad.. all legal and all public and in our faces.  Kids toys have babies dressed like hookers, dolls that appear like dead sexualized zombies, all legal for children to buy and play with.  So as much as the loli rape porn on voat bothers me, it's hidden behind the NSFW setting, it's hidden within subs, (until trolls used it to attack QRV sub, that's how I found out about it).  It's up to the Voat management to make that call on a this free speech site.

                     This is absurd. No one is being convicted for their "moral views." They're being convicted for their actions and behaviors, i.e. distributing cartoon cp and creating cartoon cp. Someone with such moral views should not be on the streets, as they are compromised, but it's their actions and behaviors that are punishable.

                 pedophilia/pederasty are VERY defined, and you are defending their normalization. When did you decide that sexual relationships with children was 'moralfaggotry'?

                  You're hewing to a narrow, jewed, modern liberal twist on relations.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  Traditional relations involve marriage between a menstruating female and an established male provider &amp; protector.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  Many traditional cultures still practice the above, the healthiest biological combination.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  Instead, people are desensitized to 30 and 40 yr old brides, shrink from an arbitrary demarcation set at 18yrs. These are unthinking moralfags, useful bots of their own white genocide. They are the enemy.

            Strange, might be just a coincidence, but the recent CDAN suggests there are about to be audition videos of Speilberg and kids from the sets of AI and Jurrasic Park where he is asking them innapropriate questions..... AI was originally supposed to be along the same premise as this, a child sex robot. But what sparked my interest is that the Screen writer for AI is an English Sci Fi writer named Ian WATSON. Same name as the child in this film.
           </p>
           <p>
            The only info i can find on this poor 10 year old Lena Watson is that it is apparently a stage name. I cannot find reference to who her parents are

            Sandra Wollner is jewish. This is expected, the jews are at the forefront of pushing pedophilia and they are the ones in control of our media, so expect more and more pro child rape propaganda from this race of filth. This is a jewish agenda, their aim is to make society as degenerate and deprived as possible by pushing everything that is evil and abhorrent using their control of the media. This needs to be talked about more and we need to tell it like it is if we are to ever remove the jewish control of the media, people need to know who to focus on and go after. Because if we do not, we will just see more and more of this filth.
