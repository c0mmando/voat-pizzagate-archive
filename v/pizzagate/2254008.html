It was 1975, I was 5 and my sister was 7,  we were walking home from the beach in the town of Stinson Beach where we lived.  The town is small and to get to the beach there are only a few walking gates to access it from town. The main one being by the parksidecafe, a little gate way over the creek.  So from town you go thru one of the entraces into the big park and parking lot area which stretches the length of town. So a really big place. After the parking lot there\'s a swath of bushes that also stretches the length of town. We were very familiar with the many tricky paths inside yhose bushes. The paths in the bushes also span the length of the town. It was deserted that day. It was totally normal our moms let us go unsupervised there was no fear at all in those days. So we are walking back via the paved path down from the bathroom s which is the main entrance to the beach. We got about halfway  down the grade toward the parking lot when we saw a little boy about 6-9 (age?) Crouched beside a tree in the nearest island in the parking lot. We stared at each other, because his body language was reading as scared we did not approach. I was in front of my sister, Itbe boy locked eyes with me he was terrified. He was waving us back with his right hand , get back gestures. We could tell he was trying to be quiet. I was frozen there wondering why is he scared what is he hiding from I looked to his left, my right, broad grey parking lot empty empty grey sky day, I saw no one .  The boy was still looking at me hard and it seemed as quiet as he could yell™run&quot;  I didn\'t run because I couldn\'t understand I looked behind and my sister was already running back up the path and took a left into the bushes paths, without me,. I looked back at the boy and he he said it one more time &quot;run&quot; this time I turned around and ran for my life, what helped me remember was how mad I was at my sister for bailing without me. I couldn\'t find her in the paths. I ended up walking back the way we had started to go home. It wasn\'t much later I came out of those bushy paths, they don\'t exist anymore like they did then, it\'s all regulated now. But I came out walked by the same I had just been. There was no one there anymore. The boy was gone,. I couldn\'t see anybody. Back home I met my sister who went back thru the next gate down which was close to our home,. We told our moms what happened and how scared we were I remember my sister telling us she said she watched from hiding while two men dressed in black that we\'re carrying briefcases gave the boy a shot in the eye.  So when I think of this memory, I have always thought it was just too too horrible, but knew my sister would not just make that up, she was 7, she was scared  from having to make it home on her own too. So thinking back on it, I called up my sister and she at first didn\'t remember, but soon started describing the boy. Dark hair, tan. I just remember the terrified eyes. Normally on an empty beach kids run into each other, they play they do something. That\'s what we did we did something. We connected. That\'s what kids do they recognise each other.  Is this pizzagate....yes because it\'s related to child abduction and torture.</p>
<p>PS I geuss I mentioned all the gates because the exit was maybe 50-60 feet from the boy, but he wouldn\'t budge from that hiding spot. And my sister said today why didn\'t he come with us. I know it\'s cause protecting us. That boy whoever he was he looked out for me and my sister. I want to send love Thanksgiving around that beautiful soul.</p>',

            Just want to comment on how your memory can take us back to childhood and 
the tremendous fear a small child can feel.
           </p>
           <p>
            And can only agree the little boy was trying to protect you and your sister.
           </p>
           <p>
            Of course, "Men in Black" are also connected with UFO/Alien sightings --
and implants -- some of which were said to have been injected thru nose cavity, some in eye.
Some in other parts of the body.
           </p>
           <p>
            These abductions are also traced to families and generational abductions/
procreation.

           <p>
            All kinds of weird stuff is coming back. After a year of this crap, I look at the world through a new lense. I have a cousin, I haven’t seen in maybe 30 years. I remember his mom was creepy. Showing all of us kids that she didn’t have underwear on, but she didn’t talk. I looked away before she noticed that I noticed. I was 5. If my mom had seen, it would have been a fight. But nobody saw. I wonder what weird crap my cousin went through.

            They did lots of illegal experiments in those days - worth reading the Plutonium Files  &amp; Judyth Vary Bakers book Me &amp; Lee.

             Thank you --
Never heard of the Plutonium Files but will look it up ...
but am very much aware of Judyth Vary Baker and her YouTube videos.
I've read some of her writings, but not the book you mention -- "Me &amp; Lee"

              Your welcome. 
Also worth checking out is the book - A Secret Order - Investigating the High Strangeness and Synchronicity in the JFK assassination (Page 126, 160 &amp; others) reveals secret experiments on US prisoners (Angola Penitentiary) and on Panamanians.

               Thank you again -- 
Made more notes -- which I actually expect to get to some time soon.  :)
              </p>
              <p>
               The experiments have been "mentioned" .... but obviously much more extensive than I was aware --
and presumably most Americans are aware.
              </p>
              <p>
               The manipulators are experts at it -- 
Americans looked out at a world complaining of US/CIA government/Capitalism
and violence/wars and believed that the past history of this US government was gone.
Now they have awakened to the reality of it as it comes home to us, but it may be too late.
              </p>
              <p>
               Our writers of history certainly didn't remind us of the violence introduced on this land by
the "invaders" and "Founders" who continue on today seeking perpetual war and total control
over populations.
              </p>
              <p>
               I've tried to avoid Facebook as much as I can, but it seems inevitable as more and more I do comment.
And I will look for Judyth -- greatly admire her courage in doing all she can to try to wake us up to reality.
              </p>
              <p>
               Happy Holiday --

             What a frightening story for a little boy and girl.  What else could you have done?  You were not experienced enough with making a decision like that.   Is there a LE person you could trust and ask if they know of anything that happened around that time.  Have you looked up possibly a little boy that was found in that area.  It may ease your mind some to find some answers.  If not, you did the right thing.  A possibly bad outcome for the little boy, but it could have been three instead.  It is odd what is locked in our minds, just waiting for you to remember.

            What a story, very scary.  A shot, like an injection in the eye?

           <p>
            I'm curious if you've tried to find out about any missing children in that area at the time?

             I just remembered this today. Talking to friend few minutes ago who said it would hide the mark. We didn't recognise the boy as from around, theres only one school for bolinas and Stinson. But brown hair in that age. Possibly light skinned  mexican, he had dark eyebrows.

                In the story they gave the little boy a shot in the eye with a needle and syringe. That is often done to hide the needle mark.
