            tyfdt, why are you making multiple posts pushing this baseless claim about "an intense spiritual high" from eating pineal glands? You need to provide linked support for the pharmacokinetic potential of consuming pineal gland to achieve a "high" under Rule 2 of our submission requirements. If not, this belongs in

            scare the kid so bad, the gland will get to the size of a grape
           </p>
           <p>
            eat the gland then wash it down with a glass of some A positive blood

            Seems to be what it's all about with them.. they are obsessed with blood and that reminds me of why we are told to never touch it . Acts 15: 20 but to write them to abstain from things polluted by idols,+ from sexual immorality,
            <em>
             + from what is strangled,
            </em>
            and from blood. 
They are blatantly doing the very opposite. 
In the Bible, the soul is said to be in the blood because blood is so intimately involved in the life processes. God’s Word says: “For the soul of the flesh is in the blood, and I myself have put it upon the altar for you to make atonement for your souls, because it is the blood that makes atonement by the soul in it.” (Le 17:11) For like reason, but making the connection even more direct, the Bible says: “The soul of every sort of flesh is its blood.” (Le 17:14) Clearly, God’s Word treats both life and blood as sacred.

            The dome.  That statue on top is a statue of the Owl of Minerva, which is popular with the elite as is Molech. But just because the owl is venerated by the Bohemian Club does not mean that it is only meant to symbolize Athena/Minerva. Lilith is also an apt identification: Lilith (Queen of the Demons), the great screeching owl mentioned in Isaiah 34:13-16; the night owl goddess that inhabits the ruins of Edom which subsequently became a permanent fixture of Kabbalistic demonology. Lilith is also closely related "to the Greek figure of Hecate, with her demands for human sacrifice," and the Grove

            Is this why Epstein is spending 29 million to fill those tunnels?

             Epstein is certainly interested in medical science hence his Jeffrey Epstein VI Foundation.

             <em>
              Epstein was a former board member of Harvard's Mind, Brain and Behavior Committee and has funded numerous brain research initiatives at the university. Epstein's affinity for promoting public access to academic science however, probably stems from his own self-taught background and the belief that higher education should be widely available.

             <em>
              To date, NeuroTV has launched 13 episodes in Season 1 and has produced 7 out of 13 for Season 2. Viewership is rapidly growing with episodes typically gathering thousands of viewers within the first six months.

             I find it interesting that both seasons have 13 episodes. These occultists can't help themselves!
