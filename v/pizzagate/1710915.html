<p>So with all THAT in mind... what do you do when people catch on but still think pizza gate is stupid? More or less agree with them. The idea that Hillary Clinton is running a kiddy diddling ring out of a pizza shop is a fucking retarded idea. She doesn\'t even own the shop, someone would have noticed, and if the pizza place is even involved, it\'s as a front. The guy who owns that place owns a bunch of other properties all over DC and his ex, Brock, is super tight with Hilldawg via CTR, Media Matters, Shariablue, etc etc.. That\'s the connection they\'re thinking of, but really it\'s not just about simply touching kids. It\'s human trafficking. The kind the whole Trump family keeps talking about, and so did the Flynns. But even that\'s only one part of an even bigger picture.</p>
<p>At this point you\'re essentially starting off with PIzzaGateâ„¢ as a jumping point to get to the head of the octopus and then go down a separate arm. Y\'know... like arms. Weapons and weapon sales. Or drugs, which is probably right next to the gun show arm. There\'s the human trafficking arm next to the pedophile arm, and probably the Dark Occult arm somewhere near the organ harvesting arm. Oh! And the shadow government arm, and the corporatocracy arm (Monsanto + Bayer = OMG we\'re fucked), and the military industrial arm...</p>
<p>At this point you just say &quot;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCrQ-wHKVi0JDWjQGcuoYnew">watch this</a>&quot;. Pgate is what started the connection to the kids and the organs and that sort of trafficking that people like Webb avoided for so long but even then it was just another piece to a part of the puzzle. And really, that\'s your answer for what this is.</p>
<p>Everyone\'s working on a giant puzzle. PizzaGate is a piece within PedoGate, the difference being the amount of politics and/or media involved.</p>',

            It is a FRI and it was mainstream media who came up with it.  In the beginning I followed every detail and I knew the early YouTube videos, 4chan and Reddit and NO ONE said that about the WikiLeaks.  MSM stated and promoted an absurd premise which they attributed to Pizzagate and ridiculed.  Since the early days, waves of deliberate deceivers and misguided people have put that forth, but that was never a reputable contention.
           </p>
           <p>
            People who are not open to Pizzagate close down at the mention because MSM programmed them against it.  But trafficking is undeniable and putting Pizzagate in perspective is a realistic view that appeals to the uninitiated.

            Pedophilia and satanic ritual abuse of kids has been going on for eons. This is beyond massive and complex. Those who want to keep working will, those who don't won't. Some will move to other areas of interest and some, like you, will ruminate.
