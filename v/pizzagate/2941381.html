<p>There is <a href="http://archive.li/Y0CPp">a much larger book on this</a>, which was written in Dutch and translated into French but never into English, and it is hard to come by.

<p>For that reason it is both invaluable and highly relevant to this sub, as Dutroux was one of the most infamous elite child abuse rings in history that basically was totally exposed but then successfully covered up, all before the age of the internet.</p>
<p>I know Dutroux has been discussed in this sub before, and I don\'t mean to post old material, but when I was writing a separate piece, I realized how difficult it is to find this page. <strong>Even when you know it exists and know what you are looking for within the author\'s website, it is extremely hard to find,</strong> so I assume that some reading this either wouldn\'t have known these testimonies existed, <em>or,</em> did not know where to find this translation of them</p>
<p>This is also a call to action in a sense, because as I said, there is an entire 300+ page book available in Dutch and French on this, and if some intrepid researcher can translate even part of it into English... I don\'t know if that\'s technically legal re: copyright, but it could provide incredible insight.</p>
<p>An additional valuable resource on Dutroux is the <a href="https://file.wikileaks.org/file/dutroux-dossier-summary-2005.pdf">case files/dossier published by WikiLeaks</a>, which is <a href="http://archive.li/vq1bd">translated into English</a> in multiple places: important to remember that the dossier and X-Witness testimony are <strong>separate entities</strong> and we do have English translations of one but none of the other. </p>

            I knew of this around the time it was initially coming out in the media and because of what I had personally experienced and it peeked my interest.My then wife, with D.I.D. and a prostitute-call girl .My young children had told me before they were threatened to not  to me and then taken to Europe. I was followed, harassed, death threatened and blacklisted by film industry. The Dutroux case,,the cover up was all so familiar to me. What kills me is when I read through different Reddit posts about it, people STILL are unable to SEE it for what it was. A massive coverup, so damn obvious yet there they are trying to justify that it was just shoddy police work, mistakes and incompetence!! Wow wow wow wow! This is are biggest obstacle, the sheep so desperately don't want to believe evil like this exists.

             Am so sorry, totally understand that it is deeply triggering material. It's also validating. And yes, even really good people will become the monsters who do nothing in order to protect their own sense of normalcy. It's incomprehensible to those who know this evil exists to be voluntarily blind, and it is definitely IMHO the biggest obstacle as you said. Hence sharing this info and information like it seems to be one of the few empowering things we can do. (IMHO)

              This is a huge reason the public purposefully turns away, grasping any plausible refutation to disbelieve and sink back into a sea of anonymity.

              We will never turn our back on these poor kids.
The light of awareness is starting to shine through.

            The highest levels of Belgium government were all mixed up in this shit and they were able to cover it all up. The Belgian people are idiots they are sheep they are cowards and it's not just Belgium it's all the EU countries elite involved in this.

             They aren't cowards or idiots, 300,000 of them marched on the street in response to the Dutroux scandal, in the white march. The authorities stamped it out, and because it happened before the age of the internet, it did not spark worldwide interest. Compare those street protests with the total absence of demonstrations after pizzagate/spirit cooking broke. Was sad, to say the least.

            Most of this is contained in Regina Loefs book she wrote. It was extremely difficult to read and believe children are growing up like this all around us. Anneke Lucas is another to look into as she was involved with the same groups.

             Googling 'Regina Loefs' brought up no hits for me beyond the original Dutroux story.
            </p>
            <p>
             Googling Anneke Lucas, however, shows numerous recent videos, articles, descriptions.
            </p>
            <p>
             THIS - attention, the spotlight, if you will - may be the only way for these horrific matters to emerge into the wider public consciousness.
            </p>
            <p>
             I have been spectacularly unsuccessful for decades now, in my ongoing attempts 6o get people engaged.
            </p>
            <p>
             While I have no answer in how to overcome this - public inertia - obstacle, I will NEVER cease in my attempts to shed light upon, and curtali/halt these abominations.
            </p>
            <p>
             If the public chooses to SEE the vaginal carving on Cathy O'Brien (9:00 minute mark of The Most Dangerous Game), to watch and listen to Brice Taylor, Greg Bucceroni, Toos Nijenhuis, Fiona Barnett, Paul Bonacci, Troy Boner and SO many others who offer interlocking, reinforcing narratives  - with many of the same people and locations specifically identified - maybe the public passivity will be shed and justice served.
            </p>
            <p>
             I will never waver from this as a goal and I thank all here - and everywhere - who contribute to this end.

                Not so much as it is Reginas autobiography and her account of her life from the time she was born. Not all witnesses want to come forward and you can’t blame them for that.

               Yes, no doubt at all that her story is true.
The incorrect spelling I used - 'Loefs' - pulled up zilch, even when  paired with 'Dutroux'.
              </p>
              <p>
               The correct spelling of 'Louf' prompted numerous articles.
              </p>
              <p>
               For people both wanting to learn more about these topics and witnessing how the marginalization takes place, the Bucceroni example offers good evidence.
An early story by a Philadelphia paper depicted Bucceroni as a lying nut job.
A later writeup by Disobedient Media showed how inadequate and skewed earlier reporting on Bucceroni's case made him seem not credible.
              </p>
              <p>
               THIS - the unveiling of the false MSM narratives - is what we the people can bring about if we continue to put forth the effort.
              </p>

               There seems to be no other way to bring about Justice.

            Thanks for posting this.

            I read much of this a few years back and, as usual, I am beyond dismayed that there is virtually no immediate uproar and public clamor for justice in these matters.
           </p>
           <p>
            To their credit, hundreds of thousands of Belgians DID protest with marches after this affair became publicized, but, nothing came of it.
           </p>
           <p>
            Same same regarding the British and Australian investigations in recent years.
           </p>
           <p>
            Ronald Bernard verifies these things occur.
           </p>
           <p>
            The wife of the Belgian (?) organized crime boss verified much of these stories with her own eyes.
           </p>
           <p>
            What are we to do about this to effect justice?

             There was actually a 300, 000 + strong march in Belgium at the time, called "

            So at the top of the page there is an outline format with a lot of links. These links just go to the same one archived page? I think they refer to HTML tags within that page.
           </p>
           <p>
            When I go to the link the archive says is the original:
            <a href="https://isgp-studies.com/Belgian_X_dossiers_victims_and_witnesses">
             https://isgp-studies.com/Belgian_X_dossiers_victims_and_witnesses
            </a>
            , and cut and paste into my browser it just redirects to the link:
            <a href="https://isgp-studies.com/belgian-x-dossiers-of-the-dutroux-affair">
             https://isgp-studies.com/belgian-x-dossiers-of-the-dutroux-affair
            </a>
            .
           </p>
           <p>
            This is more of a top-level overview of the Dutroux affair. Maybe it's not unprecedented that a web site doesn't want you to jump into an internal link. The first link under the headline "the victim-witnesses" seems like it ought to present the archived material of your post, but it doesn't work at all! Those other links under the headline do present other material.
           </p>
           <p>
            So I can attest as you say I had no luck finding this material within the author's website.

             Thank you for verifying that. It was almost impossible for me to find even with the knowledge it existed :/ That's exactly why I wanted to share it here.

             The other thing is, that even if it was an easy resource to find, it is helpful that this particular page has no NSFW images like the "Beyond The Dutroux Affair" article on the same site.

              Seems like it might be prudent to get a mirror of the witness testimony up here on Voat, or in the blockchain on Steemit, rather than merely link to it? If it's testimony, is it not in the public domain as a public record?
             </p>
             <p>
              Also, we could post a call for volunteer translators with a link to the untranslated material on
              <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/v/whatever">
               v/whatever
              </a>
              . There are many more French and other Europeans on Voat now than there were two years ago.
             </p>
             <p>
              We could also ask for help on 8chan /QResearch/.  I know there are yellow vests that would help.

               I would imagine that the testimony would be public record (but I am not versed on copyright law...) - but the large book that includes the testimonies wouldn't be. I don't personally think there would be anything wrong with copying the records available from the link in this post, and even in someone who is French or Dutch-speaking translating just the testimony portions and then preserving them here if possible.
