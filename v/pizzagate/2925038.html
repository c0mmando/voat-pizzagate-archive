<h2>The latest Woody Allen story is creepy, but let’s not call it criminal</h2>
<p><em>by Sofka Zinovieff</em></p>
<h2><em>I don’t defend the film director over his alleged affair with 17-year-old Christina Engelhardt, but the realities of power and sex are complex</em></h2>
<p>I love the #MeToo movement. As the mother of two daughters, I’m delighted to see the rebalancing of a system that was skewed to allow sexual exploitation by men in power. </p>
<p>I also salute the way society is facing up to long-ago crimes, and that adults who were sexually abused as children are bringing charges against people who believed they’d got away with it.</p>
<p>However, as a child of the libertarian 1970s and as a former anthropologist, I am sometimes appalled when the rigidity of the law fails to allow for the complex intrigues of body and heart in matters of sex. Occasionally, our pendulum swings towards puritanism.</p>
<p>This week, former model and actress Christina Engelhardt claimed she had an eight-year relationship with Woody Allen, beginning when she was just under 17 and he was 41. </p>
<p>The movie Manhattan echoes their story. I first watched Allen’s black-and-white eulogy to New York in 1979, when I was 17 – the same age as Tracy, portrayed by Mariel Hemingway. I saw nothing wrong in her affair with Allen’s character, though admittedly it was a heady time of sexual freedom; my own boyfriend was 30.</p>
<p>Things have changed since then. Engelhardt claims that her story is not designed to indict her former lover. “It‘s almost as if I’m now expected to trash him,” she told the Hollywood Reporter. </p>
<p>However, while the relationship would have been legal in the UK, in New York, the age of consent is 17. For a couple of months, Allen allegedly breaking the law.</p>
<p>“Love makes no difference,” announced a social worker I met when researching my novel Putney, in which 13-year-old Daphne believes herself in love with a much older man.</p>
<p>It takes her decades to understand that her secret “love affair” was actually grooming and statutory rape. A child is unable to give consent; emotions are irrelevant. Nevertheless, small age measurements matter during an adolescent’s delicate transformations and when the “child” is almost 17, it looks very different. </p>
<p>My mother got married at 17 (my father was 27), and notwithstanding their doomed marriage, there is a danger of infantilising 17-year-olds by labelling them “children”. </p>
<p>Removing agency (even to make mistakes) from young people and denying them control of their bodies can be questionable, however much we value their safety.</p>
<p>Literature and films are littered with May-December liaisons. Jane Eyre was 18 when she fell for Mr Rochester (about double her age) and Rebecca was in her early 20s when she married a widower in his 40s. Lynn Barber’s excellent memoir (and subsequent film) An Education details her involvement with an older man when she was 16. </p>
<p>As is common in child abuse, Barber’s parents were “groomed” alongside her, favouring her impending marriage over university. In The Graduate, a young man is seduced by the middle-aged Mrs Robinson, and another mid-life crisis pushes Kevin Spacey’s Lester Burnham into lusting after his daughter’s 14-year-old friend in American Beauty. </p>
<p>Nabokov’s Lolita stands as the archetypal story of middle-aged obsession with young flesh and Humbert Humbert’s cynical pursuit of lust still shocks. In Putney, I hoped to give a voice and agency to a 1970s Lolita figure and to explore her emotions, which are manipulated but nonetheless feel real: a terrible tangle.</p>
<p>I would not want to defend Woody Allen in general. He has already joined the ranks of the damned in the film industry and is spurned by many. If his adopted daughter’s accusations of child molestation are true, he deserves this. </p>
<h2><em>However, I would argue that Engelhardt’s “kiss and tell” celebrity claims are too flimsy to constitute another crime. Yes, Engelhardt was very young and Allen was in the position of power, but we couldn’t ban all relationships of unequal power.</em></h2>
<p>I asked my student daughter her opinion of relationships such as Allen’s alleged one with Engelhardt, when the girl is not underage. “It’s not illegal, but it’s creepy,” she replied. And that’s about right. </p>
<h2><em>Allen should have known better. But inside my mind there remains a nagging question about who has the right to peer inside the heart of a beautiful young woman and a skinny, balding man in his 40s and to judge them?</em></h2>
<p>Yes, we must protect the young. But who can designate a particular day in teenagers’ lives, which allows them to fall in love and discover the mysteries of sex?\'</p>

             Sociopaths, Psychopaths and Death Eaters

           <blockquote>
            <p>
             It is now an undeniable fact that the UK establishment has, for decades, been run by people who tortured and killed children for entertainment, for political power, and just because they could.
            </p>
            <p>
             The cognitive dissonance that statement produces in the majority of the population has provided the cloak of invisibility that has kept these people in power and their actions unpunished for all these years. When faced with an undeniable proof of any part of this, people’s shock was easily comforted by soothing assurances that the person was only one, that no one around him had been aware, that this would be taken care of. The idea of a society of torturing murderers, openly known to each other, controlling not just the UK but embedded in the upper echelons of many (if not all) countries was the stuff of conspiracy websites, those prolific disseminators of unbelievable truths well mixed with repellant bigotry and obvious falsehoods, presented as a whole to discredit all ingredients. Human trafficking is the largest criminal industry in the world. It is far less reasonable to believe it is conducted without the full knowledge and co-operation of those in power, but the power of deeply anti-social behaviour is how unwilling anyone is to believe another human is capable of it.
            </p>
            <p>
             The propaganda arm of this international ring of torturers which attempted to normalize abuse of children and babies as ‘sex’ is still very apparent in the corporate media coverage of the CSA inquiry which depicts the torture and murder of children as “sex attacks on kids”, “child sex” or a “sex scandal”. Sex is not an attack. This is not sex. The fact that these people tortured and murdered children in their recreational hours does not make them simply pedosadists, or what corporate media still likes to call pedophiles in acquiescence to PIE’s demands that they be depicted as ‘child-lovers’. Their recreation may have revolved around torturing children, but their office hours as UK media and government establishment revolved around torture and mass murder of people from all demographics. It is not sufficient to call them psychopaths or sociopaths since very few of those seriously harm others and almost none to this extent. These people who want to be known as child lovers are death eaters. They feed on the agony of others. They torture and murder not because they have to, but because it feeds something in them. The only reason they are attracted to children is the increase in pain, horror, power, and taboo. They are no less attracted to mass slaughter than they are to the torture of children.
            </p>
            <p>
             Sociopaths are attracted by what repels others. They seek filth, horror and destruction. Using the torture of children as bait to blackmail political opponents is a natural act for death eaters, as is destroying populations with ‘drug wars’ and ‘terrorism’ or using the slaughter of populations to advertise the weapons industry. People are products in the trade economy, and if death eaters are in control, people are their products to use as they wish. They are presiding over the destruction of the planet and beating back any who try to stop them because mass destruction is a compulsion for them.
            </p>
            <p>
             The attempt to conflate torture and murder with sex is not unique to the UK establishment. “Our definition of sexy was something like Khadr.” said the man who decided to prosecute a tortured child. Militias in the DR Congo are promised magic power from raping women. Israel uses sexual imagery to promote the destruction of Palestine and rape is a constant in wars, torture, imprisonment, everywhere death eaters act. Death eaters gain power by manipulation of others. Hard coercion such as the control of military and police is theirs when they gain power, but until they have attained it they rely on seductive coercion. An insistence on hard coercion to control society is a denial of the power of seductive coercion. Conflation of torture and murder with sex is a perversion of that power. An attempt to depict deeply anti-social acts as sexual freedom is an attempt to normalize deeply anti-social behaviour.
            </p>
            <p>
             <em>
              Death eaters are not child lovers. Torture and murder are not a sex scandal. Sex is not an attack. Seductive coercion is used to create society. Its use in dissociated populations to incite acts of violence is a perversion of its power used against society.
             </em>

             <p>
              The UK media depiction of the subjects of the so-called Child Sexual Abuse inquiry as paedophiles is a very deliberate propaganda exercise and attempt to manipulate public opinion. People who rape, torture and murder are not child lovers. The victims of these people were not only children. The phrase ‘paedophile’ brings the focus from the vicim to their assailant, and the pseudo-medical op-eds claim a right for understanding for death eaters, not the children. The use of the word paedophile individualizes the problem and is an attempt to pretend there are a ‘few bad apples’ instead of an entire ruling society complicit in the cover up and normalization of the torture and murder of others.

             <blockquote>
              <p>
               Language itself is highly coercive. Each word is a cognitive shortcut to a wide array of emotions and value judgements, so by a simple redefining sleight of hand people can be manipulated into agreeing with ideas they would normally reject. War is billed as peace, police states are billed as freedom, children are billed as terrorists. Few people have made the value judgements they use to assess information on their own and again, no one has the time and very few have the ability to do so all the time. Most base their judgements on emotive responses to words they have been taught to revere or revile by environmental conditioning through social circles, media or education.
              </p>
              <p>
               People are presented with ideas, events and personalities which are calculated to trigger binary moral judgements. With the amount of judgements we all have to make every day, no one has time for continual nuance and examination of everything. Information is presented by those who have taken time and care to deliver a specific message and narrow the field of options to make the choice obvious. An overload of topics of advanced complexity, presented with ever-increasing speed, has resulted in people permitting themselves to be governed by memes and slogans.
              </p>
              <p>
               Those not swayed solely by personalities are coerced by events, selected by media and others in power to create an emotional response which will steer public opinion in the direction they wish. For those few who look beyond personalities and events, messages can be easily co-opted by isolating certain ideas out of context.

             This is a powerful example of the kind of money and influence that is being used to slowly use LANGUAGE to distort and twist the truth to make it APPEAR as though the crime is much less harmful than it really is,
             <strong>
              minimization
             </strong>
             and it desensitizes the reader. Now, most of you are saying, no way, I can see through that and I know my morals",well, yes, great and good but, at the rate in which they REPEAT this language, like a madonna song from the 80's, it's going to stick with you and wear you down. Just take a consensus among men YOU think are moral and listen to what they usually have to say about statutory rape. This ain't no little house on the prairie society and you'd be surprised what most men really think.
            </p>
            <p>
             My point is whenever you see someone trying to minimize with this kind of language they are trying to indoctrinate you into accepting pedophiia as normal.

             Yes. Very important text nowadays when pedos try to push the 'child-lovers' narrative even more. Twitter also comes to mind, which lets pedos talk about their attraction to children.

            Across the Pond it may be legal yes, but here it is not. More screwed up thinking.  They need to shut up and realize that people came over here to get away from their rule. Also, MSM is sticking up for their left sided thinking and readers.  NOPE.  This is clearly illegal and according to NY Law,  Mr. Allan Stewart Konigsberg should be arrested.

             I think this has to be seen in a wider context even - basically, she is pushing the narrative that it was 'love', so that it cannot have been a crime. Sounds familiar?

              Possibly she has still not realized she was groomed.  Also has she become a pedo herself?  This does happen to those that have been horribly abused over and over.  OR she is pushing the narrative.

               Most abuse survivors do not become abusers. Research also shows that most abusers were not victims.

                 Thank you very much. I just know various research studies have statistically shown this to be true. I don't think anyone really has the full answer on what makes someone a pedo or child molester. I believe it's unclear whether there is something genetic going on, or brain damage or who knows what.  I do know that kids who sexually abuse others are usually repeating what happened to them.

                  The research could be skewed for a reason.  Another born that way of thinking?  If Children are repeating this then they are acting out in horrid anger, and are insanely angry and jealous of others that have a normal Childhood unlike them.  After reading so many accounts of SRA and also those that have been abused, especially in family cults, why do they continue to repeat this over and over.  Systemically carrying it on decade after decade.  I truthfully believe it is the anger and rage inside, for what was done to them.

                   When little kids repeat it, they arent even consciously/logically processing it. They are being filled with poison, and they go act out on it.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   I have considered that about the research and am still open to it, but as of yet have found this to be true.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   I have known many survivors and most are not pedophiles or abusers.  And i don't believe all or most abusers were abused. Still, that doesn't mean that those who go thru it don't end up perpetrating at a larger proportion than the rest of the population, yet at the same time the majoriry of survivors dont turn into pedos.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   Now, the stats for those in intergenerational abusive fsmilies, cults, sra, etc, the proportions could be different, but i still believe most of these victims dont become abusers.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   Its also important to think of just how many victims the average child molester has, which is tons.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   I think this will be an ongoing topic that is important and that you and i have a lot in common in our views.

                    I agree with your views as well.  There is much research needed on this.  I cannot even imagine what goes through a Child's mind after years of abuse, and Lord, how can they process it. After all they have not fully developed. This is what is so sad and also so perplexing.  I too know some Victims and they don't abuse either.

                    is from a family cult and she knows many as well and none are abusers.  Something vile happens in order for someone to commit these acts.  I sometimes wonder if it starts with porn.  Then it slowly escalates. In the olden days and decades and centuries ago possibly pictures and reading started it and then of course it is never enough.  We know that excessive porn has been talked about in leading to abuse.  Yes we could go on and on.  Prayers to you and to All Children +

                      I agree.  Our enemies are pushing it so that it will kill our society.  At this point it is getting worse not better.  This world has gone done the tubes with filth and depravity since I was a Child.  The way women dress and the way they let their daughters dress, it is shameful and I don't know how we can turn it all around. But the porn, that is extremely detrimental.

                Evidently the grooming has not worn off and it feels good to be loved, still.  No matter who gives it the Children that are abused need love badly usually.  They need it and the pedos know it.  He is the most miserable of scumbags.  He now has his daughters at his movie set and in a pic I believe.  More grooming?  I hope not.  But really it never ends.

              It's a beautiful demonstration of how you RANK AMATEURS fail as researchers because you don't know anything about the Jewish manipulation of information.

               Nobody around here gives a shit about what subhuman sand monkeys like you have to say. That’s why I didn’t respond, faggot. That thread got made just to push your buttons. You’re useless unless you can relate a topic to your hate boner. Your emotions are so easy to manipulate. Even the women are more stoic than you.

               BTW, not our fault you said that sex with 9 year old girls is justified. That makes you a pedo.

                Bullshit, and it clearly took you 10x as long to "research" it as it took me to refute every last bit -- because that's what I do, faggot: debunk counterjewhad narratives whereas you're cheerleading "regime change in Iran" JewAnon.  What a dope.

             The writer of the article is clearly an advocate for 'sexual freedom' given that she was 17 and had a boyfriend of 30 and sees nothing wrong with that. Were her parents not telling her to forget about something like that? Oh no, because her parents did virtually the same, only the ages were 17 and 27 instead of 17 and 30. Most fathers would be threatening to kick the shit out of you if you showed up at their house as the boyfriend of their 17 year old girl at the age of 30.
            </p>
            <p>
             The author gives some shoddy examples, including young women in their 20's in literature. The difference, you flaming idiot, is that she is an adult and the girl in question in the article was a child! She even speaks of exploitation and the complexities of that adolescent period, yet still comes out in support of it. Ludicrous.
            </p>
            <p>
             A quick search on her history shows she is descended from elites with Communist background who helped Jews in WW2. Says a lot.
