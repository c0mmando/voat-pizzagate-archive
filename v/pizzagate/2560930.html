<p>From Nolte\'s essay:</p>
<p>&quot;Before I go any further, let me make my own biases clear… Regardless of how bad things may have been between Mia and Allen, his betrayal of her and the family with Soon-Yi was a monstrous act.</p>
<p>However, Allen was not Soon-Yi’s father or stepfather, or even a father figure. Allen did not live with Mia and the kids. Allen did not even stay overnight.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Nevertheless, Allen’s behavior was appalling.</p>
<p>But this behavior was not illegal. Moreover, he and Soon-Yi have been married since 1997 and have two children of their own, and, frankly, I do not believe Allen molested Dylan.</p>
<p>Yes, as an adult, and as recently as Wednesday, Dylan stands by her molestation claim. But I do not believe it happened, and I do not know why or if she believes it. That is not for me or for anyone else to figure out. What I do know is that based on the evidence (or lack of),  two exhaustive criminal investigations, and Allen’s otherwise impeccable behavior in his personal life, at the very least, Allen deserves and should receive the benefit of the doubt.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, that has not happened.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>And because of that, there has been a disgusting movement afoot to blacklist Allen out of the film business. A number of name actors have either said they will never work with Allen, or regret that they have. To their credit, a handful of others, like Scarlett Johansson, Alec Baldwin, and Cate Blanchett, have stood by the evidence and with Allen.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>What we have here are two vastly different stories from two different children — Moses and Dylan — and no way to divine what is and what is not true. But it is not up to us to divine the impossible.</p>
<p>Each of us sits as jurors in the courtroom of public opinion and that is a responsibility we should take seriously. And with conflicting testimony and a lack of concrete evidence to back up the allegations leveled against both Allen and  Mia, I refuse to rule in favor of the either being socially ostracized and blacklisted.</p>

           <p>
            What a lie. Young people especially need older people, most especially parents. Mia was Soon-Yi's mother, and Woody was sexually involved with Mia. That makes him a father figure. Then behind Mia's back, he's sexually involved with young Soon-Yi. He's a predator. Did he get involved with Mia before or after she adopted those kids?

             During the call, recorded on the girl's answering machine, Baldwin, 49, ranted: "You are a rude, thoughtless little pig. You don't have the brains or the decency as a human being.
            </p>
            <p>
             "I don't give a damn that you're 12 years old, or 11 years old, or that you're a child, or that your mother is a thoughtless pain in the ass who doesn't care about what you do as far as I'm concerned.

            That was severe child abuse, but as is so often the case, his daughter has been expected to go along and cover up for him because of who he is.

            Thanks for your links and for all your effort and shared words in this daunting fight. Joan Didion is quoted in "Unlearning Woody Allen" mentioning that there is "no visible family" for Tracy in Manhattan and "Tracy put me in mind of an American-International Pictures executive who once advised me, by way of pointing out the absence of adult characters in AIP beach movies, that nobody ever paid $3 to see a parent."
           </p>
           <p>
            Armond White pointed out that there are no adults in Scott Pilgrim, which I much enjoyed, but putting a 42 year old Woody Allen in that would be weird. The Scott Pilgrim film really reveals the flaws of the main character and though Scott Pilgrim is far from 42 years old the film and Scott's peers are all uncomfortable with his relationship with a high school senior.

             Excellent point.  Woody Allen and his sociopathic ilk are constantly attempting to normalize their perverted exploitations.  You don't have to be old and wise to know there's something wrong with that.

            Notice how they go all Holier-Than-Thou when covering for their pedo brethren? It's like they're pontificating out their anal orifice and spewing shit seeds everywhere in hopes the narrative will grow.

            This DM is Stomach Turning -  Woody with his two adopted daughters on movie set.  Take a look.  It's just so obvious to me.  History repeating itself.  Soon Yi was brought on set too.  It's all about the grooming.  Yuck.

            Currently untitled, their father's latest movie stars Selena Gomez and Timothée Chalamet.  That movie is about statutory rape.  Nice.

            When Woody first hooked up with Soon Yi he said it would just be a fling.  Some fling.

              No,  not outright molestation.  He's not going to let you see that.  But again I agree that his movies ARE creepy.  So is he.

            This line of defense by Woody Allen is absurd and can easily be dismissed as a move by Moses on the Allen Estate.

             Moses' article does seem very well-polished, like it had a team of editors and lawyers going over it.
            </p>
            <p>
             While I do think it's possible that many of the abusive things that he said Mia Farrow did did happen, that doesn't mean Woody Allen is innocent.
            </p>
            <p>
             Moses' motivation could be the estate. Also Woody Allen seemed nice to him. But anyone who dismisses as nothing what Allen did just in getting involved with Soon-Yi you have to wonder about. Look at Jerry Sandusky's adopted son. He was arrested for child molestation too:

            But this behavior was not illegal. Moreover, he and Soon-Yi have been married since 1997 and have two children of their own, and, frankly, I do not believe Allen molested Dylan.

            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            Previn married Allen in Venice on December 22, 1997.[9][8] They have adopted two children together: Bechet Dumaine Allen and Manzie Tio Allen.[10][17]The family resides in the Carnegie Hill section of Manhattan's Upper East Side.
           </p>
           <p>
            So, these two daughters are not of a union between Woody and Soon Yi.  They were adopted.   Woody tries so hard to convince that he and 
Soon Yi are like any other married couple.  They are not.  There are now 2 young girls in their house.

             “I’m 35 years older, and somehow, through no fault of mine or hers, the dynamic worked,” the 79-year-old director told NPR in an interview published Wednesday.
             <strong>
              “I was paternal. She responded to someone who was paternal.”

                   And they both have their armies of defenders who don't care what they've done. For instance, Polanski has had his defenders at Wikipedia who downplay what he did and try to whitewash the case and defend him where his crime is talked about on his biography page (it's not mentioned there that he drugged the girl). The far more accurate picture of the case is contained on a separate page about the case that people are much less likely to read:

                    In 2004, Polanski sued Vanity Fair magazine in London for libel. A 2002 article in the magazine claimed that Polanski promised he would "make another Sharon Tate out of you" in an attempt to seduce a Scandinavian model while he was travelling to Tate's funeral. He received supporting testimony from Mia Farrow, and Vanity Fair "was unable to prove that the incident occurred." Polanski was awarded £50,000 in damages plus some of his legal costs.[155]

                   <p>
                    In 2010, British actress Charlotte Lewis said that Polanski had "forced himself" on her while she was auditioning for a role in Paris in 1983, when she was 16.[156]
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    In October 2017, a woman named Renate Langer interviewed by Swiss police said Polanski raped her in the town of Gstaad when she was 15, in 1972.[157] That same month, Marianne Barnard accused Polanski of having assaulted her in 1975, when she was 10-years-old.[156]

                    People are way to politically correct.  It makes me sick when people say It's none of my business. and look the other way.   If you let this stuff go, what else will be let go? Children depend on us to have a keen eye and clear perspective.  People are way too permissive.  Why do people think making a movie is so special that they will let producers and directors get away with crimes.  Oh, no they are not crimes, because he is an Artiste.

                     Exactly. It's terrible how the powerful are still protected. Joe Biden is another example of how the media just don't "see" what they want to, even though there's been a few articles written about why he shouldn't run for President since there are actual videos of him inappropriately touching girls.

                     In the Woody Allen case, I just came across the judge's 1993 ruling against him when he attempted to gain custody of the children following the sexual abuse allegations by Dylan. It's a very worthwhile read if you haven't read it. It goes into everything in great detail, including how Allen was already in therapy for inappropriate behavior with Dylan, and other things he's alleged to have done to her and Ronan. It also explains a lot about Allen as a parent, in so many ways declaring him unfit, and also his relationship with Moses.

                    <p>
                     I wonder how long this judge's opinion has been publicly available. Maybe it was leaked?

                      I just commented to our post.  I highly agree with the judge's opinion, but he of course has more access to what really happened.  What really burns me up is even though he has been declared an unfit parent, he was still allowed to adopt two daughters when married to Soon Yi.   There have also been questions about the mental condition of his wife.  I would like to see an evaluation of her while she was a child.
