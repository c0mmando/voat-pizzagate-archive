            No one seems to be noticing that there are several connections between Jon Heeley and James Levine, Conductor with the Met. He too was just suspended for allegations like this. This particular person is very connected in the big sticky spider web of pg.

            Found this noteworthy.
           </p>
           <p>
            Immediately upon hearing of the allegations, Disney SUSPENDED him WITHOUT PAY
           </p>
           <p>
            until the matters can be resolved by the court.
           </p>
           <p>
            In the past,. seems to me accused offenders always kept their jobs
           </p>
           <p>
            without skipping a beat.
           </p>
           <p>
            I thank God for this environmental change.ie immediate removal from post without pay.

            That's the youngest i've seen listed for a high profile Hollywood abuser.  11 sounds prepubescent.  That's another level of sickness.  Maybe this is finally moving toward exposing pizzagate.

            Am confused.
           </p>
           <p>
            He is accused of these illegal acts performed a decade ago.
           </p>
           <p>
            Three felony counts.
           </p>
           <p>
            Why was he arrested and had to post bail?
           </p>
           <p>
            I thought the statute of limitations would have run out on this according to California law.
           </p>
           <p>
            I know he can undergo a civil trial.
           </p>
           <p>
            But I though it is  too late to slap him with criminal charges.
           </p>
           <p>
            Does anyone know?
           </p>

            Thanks.

             Statute of limitations are here so victims and law enforcement don't sit on cases and thus, force a defendant to defend themselves against old charges where their memory might fade or evidence might be destroyed. However, if the delay is not caused by laziness or Mal intent, then the system does not want to punish the victim. It is understandable why a minor might not come forward in the specified time period or even understand that there is a time period of which charges must be brought.
            </p>
            <p>
             Simple explanation around the SOL from a defense attorney blog...
            </p>
            <p>
             Certain felony sex crimes against victims under 18 may be commenced any time prior to the victim's 28th birthday, or within 10 years after commission of the offense under certain conditions
            </p>
            <p>
             For a sexual crime against a victim younger than 18 where the statute of limitations has run, case can be commenced within 1 year of the date a report is filed with a state law enforcement agency, provided there is admissible, independent corroborating evidence.

            Disney Exec. Pretty good size fish pizzagaters :) Pizzagate power is real :)

            How does someone only get nine years for actually molesting a child, if he gets convicted, when some people get decades for a few pictures of child pornography? Something seems off about that to me.

              Disney Music Executive Charged with Child Sex Abuse (EXCLUSIVE)
             </strong>
            </p>
            <p>
             December 8, 2017 6:41PM PT
            </p>
            <hr/>
            <p>
             Jon Heely, the director of music publishing at Disney, has been charged with three felony counts of child sexual abuse.
            </p>
            <hr/>
            <p>
             Heely, 58, of Santa Clarita, is accused of sexually abusing two underage girls approximately a decade ago. He allegedly victimized the first girl when she was 15. According to the charges, he began abusing the second when she was about 11 years old and continued until she was 15.
            </p>
            <hr/>
            <p>
             In a statement, a Disney spokesman said the company suspended Heely late on Friday, after being informed of the charges.
            </p>
            <hr/>
            <p>
             “Immediately upon learning of this situation tonight, he has been suspended without pay until the matter is resolved by the courts,” the spokesman said.
            </p>
            <hr/>
            <p>
             Heely was arrested on Nov. 16 by deputies from the Santa Clarita station of the L.A. County Sheriff’s Department. Booking records indicate he was later released on $150,000 bail.
            </p>
            <hr/>
            <p>
             On Wednesday, prosecutors charged him with three counts of lewd and lascivious acts on a child. Heely pleaded not guilty at his arraignment at the San Fernando courthouse on Thursday. He is due back in court on Jan. 10. If convicted, he faces up to nine years and three months in prison.
            </p>
            <hr/>
            <p>
             Heely’s attorney, Robert Helfend, denied the charges.
            </p>
            <hr/>
            <p>
             “He vehemently denies these allegations and we will be fighting until the end to clear his name,” Helfend said. “It’s a shame, that’s all I’ve got to say.”
            </p>
            <hr/>
            <p>
             Heely has been with Disney since 1981, and oversees licensing of the vast catalog of music from Disney films. He also produced a series of Disney concerts around the world, such as “Fantasia Live in Concert,” that feature orchestral performances and film clips.
            </p>
            <hr/>
            <p>
             <strong>
              Heely could not be reached for comment. His Twitter bio reads, “Disney Concerts and living to glorify God in all things.”

             This is the part that really ticks me off:  Heely was arrested on Nov. 16 by deputies from the Santa Clarita station of the L.A. County Sheriff’s Department. Booking records indicate he was later released on $150,000 bail.  SO now he is out on bail so he can abuse some more girls.  Great.  Just Great.

              I wonder if this is why Santa Clarita is on fire now! I drove through the Ventura fires on mond and wed . The whole side of the freeway was on fire. My son and I drove right alongside a wall of fire ! It was one of the most shocking moments ever .. we were both speechless 😱 There were news crews on the sides of he freeway taking videos and people pulled over in utter shock ! The whole mountain looked like one big charcoal briquette ! I have live footage and will never forget that .

               I know.  The jails are filled with poor people that can't get out on bail.  There case is backlogged and some have been in there for years.  Bill Clinton is at fault for the For Profit Prisons. Another reason I hate the Clintons.

              Do you have something to back up the statement that Bel = Baal?

             <p>
              Some info says it is a word for "lord" and only a title and not a proper name. Other info claims it refers to Marduk. Always hard to track down original meanings so just curious where you pull this from.

               You are correct. It basically means lord or God. There are too many names for "God" to count.

               It depends on the time frame in history and which culture we are dealing with. Since the culture that is influencing us is the Canaanite, Babylonian culture our society typically associates "Bel" with Baal.
              </p>
              <p>
               Ba = spirit
              </p>
              <p>
               By = bel, bill, bil

              <p>
               on = light

              <hr/>
              <p>
               In a nutshell "spirit gods light" and it translates to Sun/Son of God as the Spirit Of The Sun because of Sun Worship and Son Worship.

                This video is ultimately a "flat-earth" depiction of reality; I'm surprised you don't flag it as such,

                . And it's a spiritually and intellectually stunted presentation: The narrator conflates and interweaves distorted, compressed understandings with 'revelation' of astrological and perennial mythological motifs. And I detect an agenda that
                <em>
                 clearly
                </em>
                seeks to further the satanic goal of full forgetfulness of our divinity and our holy relationship with our Creator.

                The closing remarks from the video:
               </p>
               <blockquote>
                <p>
                 “... very high odds the figure known as Jesus did not even exist.”
                </p>
                <p>
                 “We want to be academically correct in what we understand and know to be true - Christianity just is not based on truth. We find that Christianity was, in fact, nothing more than a Roman story, developed politically.”
                </p>
                <p>
                 “The reality is Jesus was the solar deity of the Gnostic Christian sect, and like all other pagan gods, he was a mythical figure. it was the political establishment that sought to historicize the Jesus figure for social control.”
                </p>
                <p>
                 “Christianity, along with all other theistic belief systems, is the fraud of the age. It serves to detach the species from the natural world and likewise each other. It supports blind submission to authority. It reduces human responsibility to the effect that “God” controls everything and in turn awful crimes can be justified in the name of divine pursuit. and most importantly it empowers those who know the truth but use the myth to manipulate and control societies. The religious myth is the most powerful device ever created and serves as a psychological soil upon which other myths can flourish.”
                </p>
               </blockquote>
               <p>
                The narrator works very hard throughout the video to dismissively reduce thousands of years of humanity's struggle to understand our relationship to the divine to -- an elaborate calendar -- and then says that aspects of the calendar have been puffed up in order to control people.
               </p>
               <p>
                It would take a book to untangle all the disinfo and misinfo in this 28 minute video. I urge interested people to look deeply into everything that is said. There is truth presented -- very cool and important astrological, astronomical, historical truths -- but it doesn't mean what this presenter would have you believe it means. The narrator rounds up a lot of valid and clarifying information, and then firmly points the viewer in the wrong direction. On its own, it's quite a deceptive piece of work.

                  is the treasure hunt of human existence -- it is rediscovery of our true nature as eternal children of the Divine. We've forgotten this radical and amazing foundation to reality, simply forgotten -- and we're having a bitch of time trying to
                  <em>
                   remember
                  </em>

               <p>
                Thousands and thousands of years we've been trying, as a species, to remember. But there is a powerful Challenger that does not want us to remember, and works very hard against us. And in the dense, dark fog of this place we just keep forgetting, and then forgetting that we've forgotten.

                 Not in my opinion. Its an explanation of Sun mythology. Its up to you to decide how you feel about mythology.

                <p>
                 I am not here to tell other people how to feel about God. I just try to explain how and why the occult is what it is. I leave it up to others to determine how they feel about God. Learning these things rattles some people's mind cage. Its part of the process of learning occult history that I can do nothing about.

                  It's not simply an explanation of Sun mythology. There are evident biases in his presentation. If you can't see them, maybe that's because they're your biases as well?
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  As (I thought) we were touching on elsewhere, "flat earth" is a metaphor for flattened understanding -- and what he presents is a very flattened understanding of thousands of years of Sun mythology -- ultimately reducing it to a glorified calendar. While of course it's up to each of us to decide how we feel about mythology -- that doesn't mean everyone is right about the meaning they decide upon.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  I'm not here to tell others how to feel about God either -- I would just like people to be given a comprehensive introduction to That which we point to with the tiny word: God.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  My understanding of who and what we are has been deeply impacted by what I have learned over the last couple of decades about Sun mythology -- which is part of the reason why I have such a visceral reaction to someone dismissively reducing it to a calendar.
                 </p>

                  And pardon the emotionality of this response -- again, the limits of anonymous text -- combined with my laziness in not fully drawing out and illustrating what I'm trying to communicate ...  At any rate, it's not your fault I'm not making sense to you.
