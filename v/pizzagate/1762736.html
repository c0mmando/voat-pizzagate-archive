            , if you happen to have a link to that guy that was talking about "therapy" dolls of children for pedos, could you add it? Search is down on Voat right now, but it was on here in the last week if you feel like browsing. Thanks!

             I'm going to say something really unpopular in this place. As sick and creepy those dolls are, but if they help dull urges isn't that a good thing? I hate to sound like an advocate for them, but right now it's impossible to any professional help. As appealing a solution of they " should be taken out back and shot" as Crowder suggests that's not really viable. What's better, having someone with this affliction going through life doing their best to suppress their urges, or having them have at least some kind of outlet that doesn't harm anyone?

               I don't think that's true at all, I think it goes against common sense. Take away the pedo aspect and ask yourself who is more likely to commit a sexual offence - a random young man or a random young man who just had sex with a doll? When Rhode Island accidentally legalized prostitution (
               <a href="https://archive.is/20160428213604/https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2014/07/17/when-rhode-island-accidentally-legalized-prostitution-rape-and-stis-decreased-sharply/">
                with a badly worded law
               </a>
               ) rapes went down. I haven't seen any evidence that suggests the contrary (although I haven't looked either).
              </p>
              <p>
               The thing with CP is to create it there has to be a victim. The logic went if you suppress the demand by making it illegal you also suppress the supply.
