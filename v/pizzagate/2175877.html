            That we have known about these allegations for so long it is a damned disgrace that this inquiry took place 12 years after the bastard died, and notably no mention anywhere on MSM of his participation in satanic rituals with these kids.  But are we surprised?  The allegations against Britton and Janner the same scenario;  accusations coming to light far too late for justice, and worse, the families of the latter having even been compensated due to the accuser being subjected to charges including "perverting he course of justice" (hmm?).  I'm looking very closely at those popping up just now fervently jumping to Heath's defence and completely denying and overlooking that he has left a trail of victims in his wake.  I'd love a chance for a forensic examination of that boat of his, 'The Morning Cloud'.   Bill Maloney and Pie and Mash films have done some sterling work helping to bring these bastards into the light.

            Deceased British Prime Minister Edward Heath would have faced police interrogation over child abuse claims if he were still alive, police announced on Thursday.
The Conservative politician, who served as the country's leader from 1970 to 1974, was accused of raping and indecently assaulting five boys.
Heath was the subject of a mammoth two-year police investigation after being named as a suspect during a historical child abuse probe.

Heath, who died in 2005 aged 89, was alleged to have raped an 11-year-old during a paid sexual encounter, and separately indecently assaulted a 10-year-old boy, officers revealed.
"Sir Edward Heath was an extremely prominent, influential and high-profile person who was arguably one of the most powerful people in the world," Wiltshire police Chief Constable Mike Veale said, announcing the investigation's findings. "The allegations against him were of the utmost seriousness and from a significant number of people."
Forty-two allegations
Of the 42 allegations made against Heath, seven would have warranted further questioning, but Chief Constable Veale said that detectives drew no conclusions about his innocence or guilt.
The alleged incidents occurred between 1956 to 1992 when he was serving as a Member of Parliament but not during his stint as prime minster, said Wiltshire Police.
Heath was notable for negotiating Britain's entry into the European Economic Community which later became the European Union. He was ousted from Downing Street by Margaret Thatcher after losing two elections. He remained an MP until 2001 and was "father of the house," the longest-serving parliamentarian at Westminster, for nine years.
Heath's godson, Lincoln Seligman, said the police investigation had cast a stain over a man who could not defend himself.
"If allegations are out there he might easily have been called in for questioning," he told BBC radio. "They had to question him, but that tells us nothing."
The findings followed decades of rumors, speculation, alleged cover-ups and previous aborted or discredited investigations.
