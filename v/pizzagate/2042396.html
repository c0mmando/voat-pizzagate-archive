<p><strong>Too Small to Fail\'s</strong>Advisory Council Members include <strong>Cindy McCain, Sen.

            Um.  Why?  What's the basis of this?
            <br/>
            Did you look into too Small to Fail and what it's about?
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             Too Small to Fail, a joint initiative of the Clinton Foundation and The Opportunity Institute, is leading a public awareness and action campaign to promote the importance of early brain and language development and to empower parents with tools to talk, read, and sing with their young children from birth. Today, almost 60 percent of children in the United States start kindergarten unprepared, lagging behind their peers in critical language and reading skills. Through partnerships with pediatricians, hospitals, faith-based leaders, community based organizations, businesses, entertainment industry leaders, and others, Too Small to Fail is meeting parents where they are to help them prepare their children for success in school and beyond. Whether at the pediatrician's office or the playground, Too Small to Fail aims to make small moments big by creating opportunities for meaningful interactions anytime, anywhere.
            </p>
           </blockquote>
           <p>
            The way that the Clinton Foundation works is they partner with an organization that makes a "committment."  In this case the partners are organizations that were already involved in making playgrounds and the commitment was adding educational prompts and information on healthy foods.   This is based on recent research about how kids brains develop before preschool and kindergarten.

              Again.   The Clinton Foundation partners with people who make a certain commitment.  In this case, one of the partners is a commercial playground equipment manufacturer.  So their commitment is add these early literacy tools into what they normally do.   Perhaps they are donating the cost/labor of this part of the playground.

            Sounds like Hillary's setting up some hunting grounds for her minions. I hope I'm wrong and there's not any nefarious motives behind it, but I could see how developers could make a secret, trap door in a structure or put a playground near a tunnel, or purposely design a parental "blind spot" (like climbing up the backside of a structure). It sounds crazy but I wouldn't put anything past the Clintons, since everything they do seems to benefit them while harming the general population.

            After the playground's finished in this Houston hood every piece of copper that's part of the construction thereof will be missing the next day, that I can tell you from firsthand experience. And the Clinton Foundation will be MIA when it's time to fix the problem.
           </p>
           <p>
            Like Haiti, they come in and make a big show, partner w/ some playground company that gets the good publicity, take what they need and want, and then leave the place to naturally succumb to the destructive elements and forces that are licking their chops in the shadows waiting to move in for the kill. Druggies, hookers, gangbangers. The place will go to hell fast. Like Okra giving away houses and then leave the people to drown from the property taxes.
           </p>
           <p>
            Why Houston? Why not some other city? There are plenty others just as, or more, in "need." For show. Because Houston is now "the most culturally diverse city in the world" and about to surpass Chicago as third largest in US. Great place to showboat that's what. How about moving in some fresh groceries while they're at it. Actually, they did indeed mention something like that. Yeah, that's gonna happen. (I sound slightly pessimistic about the whole thing.)
           </p>
           <p>
            At least their slogan is spot on. In a macabre sort of way. "Join the Clinton Foundation now to change lives around the world." Should change it to "It takes a pillage."
           </p>
           <p>
            And oh the lives these wicked people have changed.
           </p>
           <p>
            These new kiddie playground projects sound like damage control but the "Foundation" and its cronies will still have their hands in the cookie jar.

              Purpose was sold as 'Anti-Bullying' but truth be it was the safety and wellbeing of the LGBTIQ school community by exposing the kids to all sorts of weird sex shit. Courses were targetted at adolescent children, stating there are 63 genders; and genders are in the mind, not the body.
