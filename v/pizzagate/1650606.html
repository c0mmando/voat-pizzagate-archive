<p>I had come across a post a few days ago that discussed a few suspected pedos that had been concerning. <a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1639689">https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1639689</a>   
</p>
<p>One of the suspicious persons was <strong>Jason Kreher</strong>, <a href="http://archive.is/4rB3I">http://archive.is/4rB3I</a>, who is a Film Director at a global company called Wieden+Kennedy Advertising Agency. He and few other friends who work with him at W+K have some of the most distubing posts i\'ve seen and these guys are all high profile directors who do work with some of the most famous celebrities. So this needs some more digging.</p>
<p>I\'ll start with Jason Kreher . To show how this is related to pizzagate, here is one of the many pizza related posts Jason Kreher put on his instagram page:</p>
<p><a href="http://archive.is/BNkmZ">http://archive.is/BNkmZ</a> (pizza.pic, commenter says &quot;someone is gonna get murdered tonight&quot;)</p>
<p>I won\'t waste time with showing some of the pedo symbols or pizza or cheese references, which there are plenty of. I will, however, show you a good number of disturbing posts dealing with either references to baby selling, baby torture, or pedophilia.</p>
<p><a href="http://archive.is/fm7lV">http://archive.is/fm7lV</a>  (pic of baby w/ words chop chop chop)</p>

<p><a href="http://archive.is/sRP0T">http://archive.is/sRP0T</a>  (Some crazy shit went down this week)</p>
<p>Jason\'s Instagram account has a link to his Tumblr page. <a href="https://archive.is/SIrId">https://archive.is/SIrId</a>  -  which is where things start to get a bit more disturbing. If you notice his profile pic on Tumblr, it seems to look like its a drawing of a boy with his face punched in. I warn you that the following pics might be a little disturbing for some.</p>
<p><a href="http://archive.is/VX4nf">http://archive.is/VX4nf</a>  (baby slice)</p>

<p>Here is jason with Michael Kelly from House of Cards. <a href="http://archive.is/Sh3zd">http://archive.is/Sh3zd</a>  (Kelly says: Shit got crazy!)</p>
<p>Through comments of Jason, I found a friend of his <strong>Matt McCarron</strong>. <a href="http://archive.is/AR8D2">http://archive.is/AR8D2</a> (pic of him with child holding drawing of pantless toddler) He is in artist and a film director. If you go to his work website, you will see he has done commercials with Taylor Swift, Obama WH, Patrick Stewart and other big names. When you go to the link on his website titled &quot;Not work, Work&quot;...Boom! He posts the video from True Detective with woody harrelson and its just the scene with the pedo symbol on the garage! <a href="http://www.matthewmccarron.com/dont-bother/#/marty/">http://www.matthewmccarron.com/dont-bother/#/marty/</a> Its also the first thing that pops up when you go to his tumblr page <a href="http://mattmccarron.com/">http://mattmccarron.com/</a></p>
<p>One of Jasons CoWorkers at Weiden + Kennedy is <strong>Craig Allen</strong>. <a href="https://www.instagram.com/thecraigallen/?hl=en">https://www.instagram.com/thecraigallen/?hl=en</a>
He posts a pic which discusses Jasons Market for kids. <a href="http://archive.is/0NOsd">http://archive.is/0NOsd</a></p>
<p>He also has a few disturbing pics:</p>
<p><a href="http://archive.is/bB8CC">http://archive.is/bB8CC</a> (creepy set of babies in crib. <a href="https://voat.co/user/msorrell">@msorrell</a> - Those babies look crispy.

</p>
<p>If you have read through some of the comments you may have come accross <strong>Mutzenpapa</strong> who\'s real name is <strong>Jeff Kling</strong>. <a href="http://archive.is/Pwcwy">http://archive.is/Pwcwy</a>  Jeff Kling is formerly from W + K but is now the Chief Creative Officer for Fallon Minneapolis.

<p>What bothers me are the pics he posts of his daughters. They are often shirtless and not appropriate.</p>
<p><a href="http://archive.is/FBJ82">http://archive.is/FBJ82</a>  (shirtless daughter. Commenter says &quot;Is she reading naked lunch&quot;)</p>

<p><a href="http://archive.is/hexw7">http://archive.is/hexw7</a> (naked daughter. Commenter Says Feral Beauty)   I was curious <strong>Feral</strong> meant and the definition is &quot;a human child who has lived away from human contact from a very young age, and has little or no experience of human care, loving or social behavior, and, crucially, of human language. Feral children are confined by humans (often parents), brought up by animals, or live in the wild in isolation. Could Jeff\'s Kids possibly be Feral Children? </p>

<p>Another questionable guy is <strong>Tom Kuntz</strong> Aka <strong>Pinchy Don</strong> who is an Emmy Award winning Director who worked with Jason, Craig, and Jeff Kling. Here is his website: <a href="http://www.kuntzmanor.com/#home">http://www.kuntzmanor.com/#home</a>   Tom Kuntz also has some odd posts.</p>
<p><a href="http://archive.is/ceC02">http://archive.is/ceC02</a> - (7 angry kids in a pool tub. Jeff comments &quot;Feral&quot;. Jeff\'s Daughter is also spotted in the pool. Are these guys raising Feral children? Why would he make that comment? Twice the term Feral has come up with Jeff Kling. Someone asks are there more of these, to which Tom Kuntz replies &quot;kids, pics, or hot tubs?&quot; Kind of a creepy response.)</p>

<p>Another person of interest, although loosely related is a gay man with aids who is obsessed with sex and who goes by the name <strong>TheeHorsePussy</strong>. Jason Kreher reposts alot of stuff from his Tumblr page. He has two different tumblr\'s one under theehorsepussy, <a href="http://archive.is/B7UvL">http://archive.is/B7UvL</a> and another his personal one <a href="http://lochiamavanohorsepussy.tumblr.com/archive">http://lochiamavanohorsepussy.tumblr.com/archive</a>. I will include a few disturbing pics from both accounts. I\'m warning you, although everything is pretty sickening, his personal tumblr page is filled is just downright filthy stuff and full of pics of him performing sex acts. Something I\'m still trying to erase from my memory.</p>

<p>For the life of me, I can no longer find it, but will update later if I come accross it. One of the guys mentioned above posted several Henry Darger photos mentioned him by name. Turns out, Henry Darger was an artist who painted naked children and was a pedophile and was suspected of killing children. <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2005/jan/12/art">https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2005/jan/12/art</a> - <a href="http://www.out.com/sites/out.com/files/imce/darger-venus-girls.jpg">http://www.out.com/sites/out.com/files/imce/darger-venus-girls.jpg</a></p>
<p>There is another Film Director named <strong>Matt Lenski</strong>, who through comments seemed very suspicious but his instagram profile is private. Not sure how else to get info on him.</p>
<p><strong>Would be interesting to see if we could tie Jason Kreher to the John Kreher that is connected to Alefantis.</strong></p>
<p>This may very well just be a group of guys who have a dark way of joking, but given what we\'ve seen and the nature of the content and given that these guys work with some of the biggest celebrities...i think its worth doing more digging.</p>
<p><strong>Update: It appears Jason Kreher\'s Tumblr account has been taken down.</strong></p>',

           <strong>
            Feral
           </strong>
           meant and the definition is "a human child who has lived away from human contact from a very young age, and has little or no experience of human care, loving or social behavior, and, crucially, of human language. Feral children are confined by humans (often parents), brought up by animals, or live in the wild in isolation. Could Jeff's Kids possibly be Feral Children?

           For the life of me, I can no longer find it, but will update later if I come accross it. One of the guys mentioned above posted several Henry Darger photos mentioned him by name. Turns out, Henry Darger was an artist who painted naked children and was a pedophile and was suspected of killing children.

           There is another Film Director named
           <strong>
            Matt Lenski
           </strong>
           , who through comments seemed very suspicious but his instagram profile is private. Not sure how else to get info on him.
          </p>
          <p>
           <strong>
            Would be interesting to see if we could tie Jason Kreher to the John Kreher that is connected to Alefantis.
           </strong>
          </p>
          <p>
           This may very well just be a group of guys who have a dark way of joking, but given what we've seen and the nature of the content and given that these guys work with some of the biggest celebrities...i think its worth doing more digging.
          </p>
          <p>
           <strong>
            Update: It appears Jason Kreher's Tumblr account has been taken down.

            "Why would the organization that fought muslims"..........George Webb goes into this quite a bit. The idea is to create disruption within a society to keep people on the defensive and distracted while Dyncorp and the Clinton Foundation set up shop.
           </p>
           <p>
            They want to keep people guessing, keep them from organizing  and degrade degrade degrade until one day they own the whole fucking place.
           </p>
           <p>
            They did that here in the U.S. and they now own all the media companies so they can produce fake news explaining how Trump is a Nazi. In reality THEY are the Nazis and Trump is just a giant raised middle finger, a giant fuck you if you will.
           </p>
           <p>
            They always accuse their opponents of what THEY are. They're Nazis so the hide that and accuse Trump of being a dictatorial Nazi.

            I think George Carlin was the best at explaining it:

            Wow. Nice find! makes those pics of his kids even more disturbing knowing the meaning behind mutzenbacher. This is just sick. He is a film director and there are pics of his kids naked posing for him. Can't rule out that this guy is filming and taking photos of his kids and maybe selling it off to pervs who will pay top dollar for the content.

            So after reading my post, your conclusion is that I am just doing this because i have pedophilia attraction to these images? Boy are you a nutcase. You are right about one thing...I do have a problem...with pedos...and the people who defend them like you.

            You think Kreher posted it on his page as a praise to the men who recused a girl from a well? Regardless of the artists original intent, Kreher has a habit of posting pedo related things. He prolly didn't even know who Jessica McLure is, like most of us here. Its more likely he liked what he saw and posted it as he does with all his other creepy posts.

            Guess the pedo monitor this site pretty closely. Some the links already don't work and instagram pages have been set to private.

            Whoa, I was just rooting through this dudes instagram account a couple days ago. I clicked on this image:
            <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/BOX6_AxBY_f/?taken-by=jasonkreher">
             https://www.instagram.com/p/BOX6_AxBY_f/?taken-by=jasonkreher
            </a>
            A commenter on that image named jessand831 has a private account, but her name is listed as Jessica Andrews-Wilson. A Google search of her names leads us here:
            <a href="https://guideinc.org/who-we-are/staff/jessica/">
             https://guideinc.org/who-we-are/staff/jessica/
            </a>
            She's the executive director of GUIDE, which is an organization which proports to assist children impacted by drug and alcohol abuse. I bookmarked it for later investigation, but maybe someone with a skill set superior to my instagram snooping wants to take a look at GUIDE, because I frankly don't know where to begin.  Aaaand... there's a pentagram with a spiral inside featured in their logo, but I'm sure that's just cause kids LOVE stars and spirals /s/.

            If you joke about being a terrorist or harming the president you will be in a shitstorm of trouble.
Joke about raping, torturing, and eating babies, repeatedly, and you get called fake news.

            I came here skeptically because I've seen too many - LOOK I TROLLED THROUGH INSTAGRAMS AND FOUND STARS AND MOONS SO SATANISM!!!!

           <p>
            But this is spot on.  On a scale of ok, weird, disturbing and clearly pedo/cannibal,  the majority of these links fall in the clearly pedo/cannibal category.   OP is right, these actually make JA's instagrams look a little tame alongside.   Wow.   Can you turn over to the FBI?  These guys are mostly likely getting a fix on these fetishes somehow.  I hope that daughter is safe.

            I'm still shocked, even after 4 months, at how openly this has been displayed. Honestly, I always assumed pedos were just creepy people in your neighborhood that kept to themselves... I had no clue they were a huge community like this.

             There is a literal community. Made up of people you go to parties with and hang out with through friends of your friends. Young people, seemingly normal hipsters. Pedophilia and child abuse, as it's been revealed through this, is a literal subculture - it's a fucking trendy club.

              Yea it's obvious NOW, but prior to 4 months ago, I would have never even guessed. I, like most people, go to work, come home, eat, sleep, do leisurely things, and repeat the next day. I didn't spend time learning about this whole culture. Nobody else wants to either. That's why bringing awareness to the whole thing is kinda difficult. If the personality of someone won't allow them to open mindedly investigate into this, then they just wont do it. It's not fun. It's not going to make your life any better. It's a commitment though to the kids and for justice

            A lot of important links down below are not archived...someone know how to an please do? Also, there was one comment below that said the babies are fake, props- even so, if true, who would do that anyway. This whole thread needs to be submitted to the FBI ASAP, anyone know how?

            I'm not really sure about Jeff Kling in this instance. Jason Kreher for sure, Jeff Kling just seems like someone tries to be funny and isn't. All the young girls in his photos are his daughters. Someone convince me otherwise and inform me of what I'm missing.

             * In this photo Kling is advocating people to DM him regarding "love messages" his "team" can forward to displaced Syrian refugees in Zaatari Refugee Camp, Jordan. Zaatari is primarily made up of school children under the age of 18, according to UNHCR.

             This is coming from a man who posts about eating and killing children, jokes about raping babies and putting them in ovens, likes and has links to people who are blatant pedophiles and has endless photos of his own naked daughter with disgusting captions all over his personal (and other) instagram accounts.

              Okay. Thanks for all the clarification. I changed my mind about him after I posted that. I completely agree. The suggestive pedo culture swirls around both of these men's instagram and tumblr accounts. I openly messaged Jason Kreher on his tumblr. When you message him it says "Tell Jason your problems." I said, "My problem is this: People who promote pedophilia and child abuse. #Pizzagate has you."
I've done this to a few others to scare them into doing something stupid. Like making their accounts private after we have all their stuff saved anyway. They make it private it means they're 100% guilty. Both these profiles promote the same "culture" that Alefantis' instagram was littered with. Most of these people claim homosexuality, yet think images and video of children being killed, cooked, baked, cut up, kidnapped, or an asian babies chubby face sexualized is normal.

            This guy's a Pedo for sure and pizzagate is watching him like a hawk. We're seriously these people's worst nightmare. Once we make the connection by they're symbolic posts that reference their sexual love for children, we don't stop. Hey Jason Kereher, you're what PizzaGater's call "more evidence."

            This is like Biden fondling children in plain view with not one law enforcement or child protective service looking into it. Just outrageous. I want every single one of these sick pr*cks to go down and rot in prison! Think of a child trying to fend and protect themselves from these monsters. They're defenseless. Absolutely defenseless. It's why they need us to keep digging! It's all about the children.

            Very interesting...you might check with tie ins to the artist community in Maria, TX...a town of 1200..check the Pizza Foundation website...pretty sophisticated for a town of 1200 eh?  Donald Judd is the artist who first moved there...he is mentioned by Alefantis..and his art was painting bunkers...

            With a hard cheese, the mold only penetrates a small distance in, and can safely be cut off. With a soft cheese....well, I think modern civilization might just be a soft cheese.

            The black-pill that we all need to come to terms with is this. This is how the world works. This has infested every level of society. We ultimately can't do anything about this. I hate to be defeatist but upon browsing thousands of Instagram accounts, the knowledge we already have about this, it's blatant to see this is a malignant cancer and it's been going on for much longer than we could ever conceive.

            The world runs on the misery and torture of children. People use children as currency everywhere, right under our noses. Our favourite companies, corporations and brands, even fucking CHARITIES and not even at the highest levels, are involved in the stealing and trafficking of children, they sell them to anyone if the price is right. The people at the top who derive personal pleasure that we will never understand in the course of our lives through abusing, raping and killing children are the ones who pump the cash into this machine.
           </p>
           <p>
            The trafficking, rape, torture and satanic murder of children is the most lucrative business in the world and it's occurring everywhere.
           </p>
           <p>
            Someone please tell me what is the point, how do we go on with this knowledge? What are we supposed to do? We can sit here and find 10,000 obvious pedophiles and yet we can do nothing.
           </p>

             The hope that we have, ironically, is in its growth. When this thing reaches a certain apogee - and pizzagate may well be precisely that - there will be a tipping point where the wilful disbelief, the disinclination to countenance that paedophilia=ultimate power - will crumble away.
            </p>
            <p>
             People will be forced to come to terms that not only are their children not safe anywhere, but that this thing also destroys all the adult rungs of prosperity and success on the ladder, as people come to realise that no matter how talented, dedicated or suitable decent people are for positions of responsibility, the Paedostocracy will ensure that one of their members is instead appointed irrespective of the suitability of that corrupt candidate.  And I think that dynamic might be one reason the military and some of the IC has Donald Trumps back - it must be getting so that folks within the US govt apparratus cant get any job done without butting up against these creatures, and so where once they would be silent for self preservation, they now know they will perish regardless if this thing is not taken down

             Perhaps only out of pure will, but: trust that there is the possibility of change.  The world has enough to provide for all our needs without this disease.  Therefore, it is optional.  Our challenge is to find the cure.  I think exposure has to be at least a huge part of that cure.  The other ingredient I feel certain is needed is hope.
            </p>
            <p>
             Hope and change.  Jeez... am I running for president??

            just an idea: but i find it interesting that there is such a push for Abortions through planned parenthood, and the sudden influx of this information. it makes me wonder where the black market of these baby parts is going. not to mention, what about DCS/CPS across America? why such a push for illegal activity to cover for legal kidnapping, and legal murder? there has to be a connection there somewhere.

            Clinton being tied to trafficking

            </a>
            which lead to a HUGE web of CPS/clinton foundation and trafficking of legally Kidnapped children, private adoptions, etc....
           </p>
           <p>
            so there is the clinton+Cps connection... now onto the baby parts being sold on the black market (which we all know they've been caught doing already.)

            ---&gt; this account is "liked" by Alefantis on Instagram. I found it through clicking "suggested people" on Alefantis' account and this account came up. It has 1 post, but 130 followers, among them are
            <strong>
             Alefantis and Sascha Lords

            ----&gt; This is the single picture on the account and it has disturbed me immensely. I don't really know what to think but my gut is telling me what most of you probably already think upon seeing this. Now, where or what is Greenpoint? Is it Greenpoint in Brooklyn or is it a place in DC?

            Searching "People's Ping Pong Party" lead me to this

            <strong>
             (this video is incredibly disturbing, watch it through to the end)
            </strong>
            We have a clear shot of these people's faces and they are no doubt linked to Alefantis and Comet. We can find out who these fucking freaks are.
           </p>
           <p>
            Also on the youtube account is this

            </a>
            , which seems to be a cryptic message laughing at the world because this guy is totally aware of the child abuse that permeates and fuels politics 
These are new leads we need to look into. I warn you that the first video is extremely unpleasant and unsettling.

             i'm writing these notes as i scan, and re-rewatch the video....
            </p>
            <p>
             *the words in the video are CNN stating "Senator John McCain speaks at Alfred E Smith memorial Dinner"
            </p>
            <p>
             *states that show up are Saint Paul Minnesota
            </p>
            <p>
             *Bill Clinton, John McCain, Sarah Palin, George Bush Jr. (with the banner, Mission Accomplished, seems to be something there.) Gingrich, Obama (seems to be the prominent "High roller" of the video.)
            </p>
            <p>
             *Money, Drugs, Children, Parties, common themes, the post "if you see something, say something" is shown. children's beauty pageants seem to be a hidden thread as well.

             the overall feel of the "politics are sexy" video seems to be that it's the ultimate hedonistic Life style and that you can basically be the most powerful, sexually dominate force in the world. also seems to have a politics are a giant swinger buffet note to to it. it's also interesting to note that "kids, cigars, kids, cars, kids" is repeated incessantly in this video, the kids being the main focus here.

             the sexual innuendos between McCain and clinton are a bit obvious but i'll note them anyway.

             now onto the links...
i find it incredibly, and sickeningly, odd that his two channels that are subscribed are Cyriak and Mo0nstrosity. both of which have...unnerving(? help me with the word.......) videos on them. Mo0nstrosity has videos that were recorded at Kingkiller studios and were recorded by a Daniel Lam.
            </p>
            <p>
             the videos that are Liked by Saintstereo are...off putting. something is here... it makes me ill in the stomach. especially the "Linsanity" video.
            </p>

             this song

             however is the most cryptic piece.... it seems like there is a place, or meeting in this song that may have some clues. please, correct me if i'm just seeing connections where there are none. but the more i listen to it, there is references to vague descriptions of parties, places, times, landmarks, and of course the reprisal of "Syracuse baby" over and over...which given all that i've seen here, i can only assume that is having to do with Eating/molesting/harming children at college parties or secret meetings.

              The rap song is shit, like most rap.  If someone wants to make/find a transcript, I'll look at it, but I'm not polluting my nice white brain with that monkey garbage.

            Oh my God, how are these pedos allowed to get away with this? They need to be stopped I think this will come to the stage where we will have to take the law into our own hands. Here s a pic from the insta of another monster, she is tagged in pic of that pedo holding an innocent baby

             When that day comes, and it may be soon, I predict we'll see a whole lot of people joining us quickly.  It's going to snowball when people realize this is really it.  There must be lots of people who each know enough about this to know it's real, but are living in fear due to no place to run.

            This is it, I am throwing out all my movies ect.. These HollyPedo MFers are Evil! I don't want my $ going to support anything in Hollywood. 
There needs to be laws against any children allowed in movies, commercials, TV, modeling, ect. This is NOT art! It's not talent! It is perverted and needs to be stopped!
The names of all these sickos needs to be posted all over and exposed!

            Tremendous find. Reminds me of the early Alefantis findings. These people are pathetic. So this is America huh? Now we know. Wonder how long we will allow this.

            "The mom wasn't even watching the stroller" - this reminds me of Lost Boys in Peter Pan. They were they boys that supposedly fell out of strollers when the nannies weren't looking. Now I wonder whether this was supposed to be a reference filled with sinister content. J.M. Barrie, the author, took illegal control of his dead friends' kids, having falsified the mother's last will where she named her close relatives the guardians in the case of her death.

            Disposal of ugly children - this is macabre, anti human! If I had the powers of Nero, I would have them locked up in a mental institution. We are looking at some seriously disturbed mother$&amp;@s!!!! (I could not find another word) Where are the police, FBI, folks with white robes. Just look at the captions, the photos.

             They are definitely fake. They work in the film industry and have all sorts of realistic props. I saw another photo of Craig Allen holding one of those creepy babies and he calls it a prop for their shoot. So its definitely fake. But still disturbing to post it and did you notice the comment from AKA_Manchild. he says "I'll - have the nicely toasted one second from the left. He looks fun." WTH. Go to his instagram page and see he is another pizza and kiddie loving guy. I put another comment if you can find with some of his creepier posts.

            Wow.  The thing that bothers me most about these people (apart from the obvious!) is the way they think they're
            <strong>
             soooo
            </strong>
            fucking funny.  They all congratulate each other on their own lame psycho humour.  They come across as deeply impressed with themselves.

            * In this photo Kling is advocating people to DM him regarding "love messages" his "team" can forward to displaced Syrian refugees in Zaatari Refugee Camp, Jordan.
            <strong>
             Zaatari is primarily made up of school children under the age of 18, according to UNHCR
            </strong>
            .
           </p>
           <p>
            The pedophile swirl in the heart on the balloon with the words in the background "Thank you for shopping" is blatantly the focus and message of this picture.
           </p>
           <p>
            <strong>
             JASON KREHER HAS "LIKED" IT.
            </strong>
           </p>
           <p>
            This is coming from a man who posts about eating and killing children, jokes about raping babies and putting them in ovens, likes and has links to people who are blatant pedophiles and has endless photos of his own naked daughter with disgusting captions all over his personal (and other) instagram accounts.
           </p>
           <p>
            <strong>
             Jeff Kling and Jason Kreher are connected to and directly involved in child trafficking, there is no doubt in my mind.
            </strong>
            At this point it looks like Kling himself is working with UNHCR and has connections "working" in the child refugee camps in Jordan. His wife is familiar with Obama which means he himself most likely is too. All of this leads us to the necessary speculation and probable outcome that
            <strong>
             UNHCR
            </strong>
            is directly involved in trafficking to some extent. In my mind there is, at this point given what we know about this entire thing, absolutely zero doubt.

              omg, are you a moron--'it doesn't matter if it's a Roxy logo'??? Of course it matters.  The photo is of a man's arm. He advertising Roxy swimwear.   This thread needs to be taken down by the mods.  There's a lot of misinformation here.

               You've pointed out exactly one thing, which isn't even that big of a deal, jump to "a lot of misinformation, which isn't true, and are now trying to get the whole thing removed by the mods? You're pathetic...

                Granted, the photos are creepy and photographing your children semi-naked is highly inappropriate, especially because they can't consent and those photos will now ne used by pedos.  But why did the poster have to cut and paste to add a symbol that is NOT a Pedo symbol? Where is the pedo swirl in the blood on the floor?  I'm sorry I sound suspicious, but people have to get their facts right.

             the evil is so pervasive.  where the hell do we start.  those who can search/hack download on Tor are needed.  like this guy who found all this sick material.  the creepy babies in the crib looked dead.

             Kennedy gave a very memorable speech about shadow groups behind the govt.
He tried to break/dismantle the CIA. 
He tried to tell everyone way back when. And he got a bullet for it.

               You get it. Don't forget Eisenhower's warning about the Military Industrial Complex speech. He too was warning of shadowy groups in the background that could be working against the interests of the American people

                Yeah. Basically everything Eisenhower warned about, came true.
               </p>
               <p>
                The irony is that Eisenhower helped setup the Bay of Pigs, which led to the JFK assassination and the takeover by the military industrial complex.

               <p>
                And this goes back even earlier to Operation Paperclip and the Federal Reserve. But I digress.

             I've been thinking for years how it's transposed into the death cult of Hydra in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (Along with ancient alien gods and related death cult, dear to the «freemasonic»/satanic societies..) When you look at some arcs in the overall MCU universe (both movies and netflix shows), you start making hard-hitting parallels to a bunch of disturbing stuff that we have known for years (nazis in CIA/Nasa through Operation Paperclip, for starters!) and are uncovering as days goes by... For instance:

               I rewatched "Lost Boys" and it's sickening. It's PizzaGate. And it is all a big joke. Not to mention Corey Haim and Corey Feldman are in it and you know of Feldmans accusations about Pedowood.

             </a>
            </p>
            <p>
             Look at each suspicious photo that has a child in it, such as this ---&gt;
             <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/BLWarS7hXKU/?taken-by=jamaican_me_crazee">
              https://www.instagram.com/p/BLWarS7hXKU/?taken-by=jamaican_me_crazee
             </a>
             , and then look through who's "liked" it. Look at the account
             <strong>
              "chivexp"
             </strong>
             . This is
             <strong>
              Emmanuel Lubezki
             </strong>
             , who has WON MULTIPLE OSCARS AND IS AN ACCLAIMED CINEMATOGRAPHER. He is liking EVERY SINGLE PHOTO that has a CHILD in it.
            </p>
            <p>
             Keep digging through who's "liking" any of these suspicious photos, and we can see this ring is so overwhelmingly huge and most likely incorporates a gigantic portion of Hollywood / media. It's so disgustingly depressing

             Sometimes there are many more comments than can fit on a single page.  Does archiving these links save all the comments?  The comments may contain some extremely important clues.

              Good question and I agree. It would have been too long to add notes on each comment. But definitely look through them and you will see these guys are definitely fishy. I believe the link to the original page shows up on the archive. So you may be able to get to see all the comments that way if it's cut off on the archived page.

             Thanks lad. After pizzagate the very common baby killing meme has new meaning especially if someone is obsessed with it.

            Thank you for following this up, I appreciate it immensely. Seeing this thread made me extremely happy to know other people took notice of my thread so thank you so much, I knew this Kreher guy would possibly lead to a smoking gun. Let's get that Alefantis connection happening. Kreher is 100% guilty and this ring is of utmost importance. Look at what these guys even
            <em>
             look
            </em>
            like; it's almost like they are the quintessential, archetypal satanic pedophiles that come to mind when we think of them. It's almost too perfect.
