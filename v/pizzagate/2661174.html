           <p>
            Wow. So I was looking at the comments from the article you linked and I found this comment from someone. I have no idea whether this is 100% factual or not but very interesting:
           </p>
           <p>
            The original story linking Ingvaldson &amp; Justin is from 2012. Ingvaldson also had links to extraordinarily scummy paedophiles in (surprise) England.
           </p>
           <p>
            Back in 2012 there was also the sensational case of the Canadian Psycho, cannibal and LA Porn Star Luka Magnotta, who dismembered a Chinese student, Jun Lin, in Montreal. He posted a video of the dismemberment, but not the murder, and then fled to France and eventually Berlin, where he was captured.
           </p>
           <p>
            What's interesting, with what we know now, is this statement from a friend of Luka's in Moscow:
           </p>
           <p>
            "Viktorin Khlynin 8 Jun 2012
           </p>
           <p>
            "I’m from Russia. About Luka… We all must help and support him! Yes Luka became insane through a time. Very very very insane and more more and more insane in time. He made awful things with Lin. So sorry for Lin((( Lin was good… Luka was in child pedophiles pornography ring (his parent or parents also have some connection with one) with 5 or less years old. It why he hate own parents and they don’t want to see him at all even now!!! Now he (with Homolka) posted bags with body’s parts to political elites and in some schools. Why? Because this schools have connection to child pedophiles pornography ring and son of ex-Prime minister of Canade have link to it too!!!! Homolka with Luka made it in world NEWS and PRESS. Sorry but may be only this manner they may took attention to this things and show US that elite are satanic!!!"
           </p>
           <p>
            Other interesting bits: Luka worked as a model-for-hire (rent-boy) in Moscow and was friends with a (at the time) multi-billionaire friend of Putin. Putin and the moneyed friend had a falling-out and the poor friend was reduced to a uni-billionaire.
           </p>
           <p>
            Abel Danger (a crazy and hard-to-read conspiracy web page) claimed that Magnotta's Chinese victim was at the time a student at Concordia University, allegedly a center for man-in-the-middle kiddie porn used to entrap people by the Deep State.

             Good advice. One of them links to a You Tube vid exposing Trudeau and pedo friends. The first article shown is about Canadian "humanitarian" worker Peter Dalglish, arrested in Nepal for child trafficking. I think this is linked with this current arrest of Trudeau's pedo roommate. Remember there was a single "unconfirmed report" that Pompeo secretly went to Nepal while visiting North Korea, and got evidence that Dalglish had "frazzledrip" video and released it to Dark Web. Story shut down after a day. Did Dalglish "sing"? Senator Feinstein's husband R. Blum has spent YEARS going to Nepal (even before they married) as a mountain climber, becoming friends with Sir Hillary. Nepal is known to be a high child/sex slave trafficking center. Blum just happened to start a 501c3 called American Himalayan Foundation, based in SanFrancisco. One of their missions is to address child trafficking in Nepal. As an investor, Blum has connections with CHINA, just over the border. NOW, TRUMP IS TWEETING ABOUT FEINSTEIN'S DRIVER BEING A CHINESE SPY!

             “The leader of the Russia investigation, Dianne Feinstein, had a Chinese spy as her driver for 20 years. And she’s leading the Russian ‘witch hunt.’ Isn’t that something? And then she says to me, ‘What did you know about this and that?’ Give me a break.”

             "Last week the American Himalayan Foundation (AHF) hosted a beautiful dinner at the Four Seasons in San Francisco to support its “Stop Girl Trafficking” program."
"Every year, around 20,000 girls are taken from their homes in Nepal and transported to India and the Middle East to work as slaves. Of these 20,000, it is estimated that 12,000 to 15,000 end up as prostitutes in Indian brothels."

             "Feinstein also has received scrutiny for husband Richard Blum's extensive business dealings with China and her past votes on trade issues with the country. As a result, her financial disclosure statement -- nearly the size of phone book -- draws clear lines between her assets and those of her husband. Many of her assets are in blind trusts."

              MORE ON FEINSTEIN'S CHINA CONNECTION...I think this is tip of the iceberg. There's a reason Trump tweeted about her.
"Sen. Feinstein had a Chinese spy on her staff: report"

             <p>
              Her husband, Richard C. Blum is a Globalist big-wig.
"Richard C. Blum, Investment Executive, Elected to Brookings Board of Trustees
Wednesday, December 31, 2003"
             </p>
             <p>
              "Blum is co-chairman of Newbridge Capital, which is a major private equity investor in Asia."

              Also, Feinstein's aid's name is RUSSEL LOWE. Russell is a China-opium dealer family name. They were very powerful in Hong Kong. Connections?

              Thank you for all that info.  You are a great researcher  As you and I both know there are no coincidences.  I will go into the links tomorrow.  I am not shocked over Feinstein.  Harvey Milk and all that.  I believe she is the richest person in Congress, if not, she is close.  Now we know why.  There are a lot of them that have Chinese connections.  McConnel and Emanuel do too.  You should do a post on this.  Or did I miss it.
