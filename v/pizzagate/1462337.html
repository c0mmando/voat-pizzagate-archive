<p>IN FACT supposedly two FAKE media outlets posted it BEFORE it happened:

            What I noticed in the first reports I read was that they didn't give a time for the incident - I thought that was odd. It's as if they didn't know what to say about that matter yet.

             Strange.  I did read someone later posted that times of articles can be a little misleading, so it's possible the article was actually after the event.
