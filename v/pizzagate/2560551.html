            Mueller was paying Epstein for videos of power players having sex with kids a lot of intelligence agencies paid for those blackmail videos. Mossad always got first look at the videos then FBI and CIA then MI6 the videos of VIP's raping kids is the most valuable blackmail video in the world that is why Epstein was kept in business and never faced any real prison time.

            Hate to be the one who points this out, but that's not the FBI's site or server (based on what it looks like).
Compare the vault address to the real
            <a href="https://www.fbi.gov/">
             https://www.fbi.gov/
            </a>
            site... the layout, the title, just too much is different between the two.
Beware of the PDF's... PDF's can contain lots of nasty's.

            We have a long way to go before any more juicy details emerge about Jeffrey Epstein. There were state and federal criminal  investigations in Florida and at least one civil suit in New York.  The Miami Herald and Mike Cernovich (sp?) have lawsuits pending to release sealed documents. We might want to defer to those with resources and try to keep tabs on them. We can also just  lurk on the Internet  for  any new information floating out there. We can only hope that unredacted LE reports get released along with depositions and affidavits.
           </p>
           <p>
            A while back I stumbled across an affidavit of one of Jeffrey's girls that said he liked to procure virgins because they would be free of disease such as AIDS. Makes you wonder if Bill Clinton has some ulterior motives behind his AIDS  iniatives. All of the elites want clean victims whether for sex, organ harvesting etc.

            Let the shills try and say pizzagate ain’t real. Somebody’s names got blacked out here. Some pretty powerful people visited that island. There was definitely child sex slavery.

             The MSM claims Pizzagate is about a porn ring run from a pizza shop, which is false , oh how I wish it was that simple.

             Pizzagate is not real.  None of the original claims of pizzagate have stood up.
            </p>
            <p>
             The claims of the NYPD finding all this incriminating evidence on Weiner's laptop before handing it to the feds, fell apart this week.

              Huh?? Pizzagate as a phenomenon is real. There was talk early on to change the name of the citizen investigation to Pedogate in order to disassociate from Comet Ping Pong and  broaden the scope.  But the name stuck like glue.
             </p>
             <p>
              You were right about Erik Prince. He apparently was regurgitating sensational unverifiable hearsay from a variety of sources. I also came across a reference to there being 65,000 emails on Weiner's computer,  not 650,000.
             </p>
             <p>
              Poor Weiner. Hillary stole his wife away and he was too much a public figure to get entangled with a mistress without notice. Phone sex was his only outlet.

               I think 650,000 were the total emails.   Something like 43,000 were relevant to Hilary Clinton and over 30,000 of those were duplicates of emails they had already reviewed.

               ....because folks knew they had hit a dead end found no crimes.  There is no overarching pedogate either.  The are individual pedophiles or groups of pedophiles, but to link them all together in one overarching conspiracy is unreasonable.
              </p>
              <p>
               For example, there was a politico's son in NY arrested for child porn, he worked for a city agency and was Democratic activist.  In CA, the deputy attorney general was arrested for child porn.  He was the son of a Watergate figure.  Are they part of Pedogate?  Are they connected it anyway?  Did they even know the other existed?
              </p>
              <p>
               Even when a child porn site like Elysium or Playpen is taken down and dozens are arrested.  How connected are the people who are arrested.  They might know each other on the internet, but most would be unknown to each other.  If someone on this board was arrested, how connected to him or her would you be?  Even closer connections can be dubious.   Let's say you know someone in real life and it comes out that he has been visiting prostitutes.  If you didn't know that, do you bear any responsibility for that? I think most folks would keep vices like this secret and close friends may not even know.  Donald Trump knew Jeffrey Epstein since the 1980's.  Does that mean he knew Epstein's secrets?  Epstein wasn't arrested until 2005.  Epstein was also considered a mysterious figure.  Did that mean his friends knew what was happening in house in Florida?
              </p>
              <p>
               but getting back to pizzagate none of the original claims have stood up.

               There's no code used in the Podesta emails.
              </p>
              <p>
               The "code list" that was passed around had no source because it never existed before the Podesta emails.  It was just an screenshot from some anonymous person and the zero evidence on the internet for it existed previously.  And it made some obvious mistakes.We know that CP was a term used on 4chan for child pornography.  People would say "Post CP."  To make fun of this people could post things like pics of Copier Paper or Captain Picard or Cheese Pizza which became the most popular CP, so pizza would mean pornography in this instance.
              </p>
              <p>
               There was no prior connection between Laura Silsby and Hillary Clinton.  Hillary Clinton had never heard of her before she was arrested in Haiti.  We know exactly when the State Department became aware of her.
              </p>
              <p>
               Clinton's involvement in her case are due to the fact that Consular Services to Americans overseas are one of the most important duties of the State Department.
              </p>
              <p>
               There's no connection between James Alefantis and Laura Silsby.  Alefantis knows folks who raise money for a Haitian orphanage.  It was claimed this was the same orphanage is where Silsby got her children from.  That is false, we know exactly where she got those kids from.
              </p>
              <p>
               The Weiner laptop claim has been shown to be false.    None of it stands up.

               You might find Marina Abramovic bizarre, many do, but she's a performance artist and a deliberately provocative one.  She doesn't lead a coven.  She's a performance artist.  My favorite lie about her was the picture where she is supposed wearing a Satanist Cross, when actually it was the Austrian Decoration for Science and Art.  I think you tend to be grounded in facts and evidence more so that most on here.  If you want to see who she is, check out the documentary on her The Artist is Present.

                  Sounds like a bullshit claim to garner sympathy for a known shill.

                  If its true, proof it. Physical evidence. The ransom notes, ransom video, complete news articles.

                 <p>
                  No redactions or censoring in any of the requested physical evidence either. The ENTIRE thing too, not bits and clips. Won't believe your claims if there's any redactions.

                  <p>
                   Well, I tell ya, when you have been kidnapped, tied up, taken away and held for ransom, you really start to wonder you are.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   That's when I realized
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   Well, I am an American boy
Raised on promises
I couldn't help thinkin'
That there was a little more to life somewhere else
After all it was a great big world
With lots of places to run to
And if I had to die tryin'
I had one little promise I was gonna keep
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   I said to myself, Tom, you need to forget all the petty stuff if you want to get out of here alive.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   O yeah, all right. Take it easy, baby
Make it last all night
I am an American Boy
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   I still remember the details of my escape from a Gainesville, Florida motel, where I was taken by the Heartbreaker gang who had kidnapped me, tied me up, taken me away and held me for ransom.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   Well it was kind of cold that night,
I stood alone on the balcony
Yeah, I could hear the cars roll by,
Out on 441 like waves crashin' on the beach
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   The cool air felt like freedom, but I still had my doubts
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   And for one desperate moment
There it crept back in my memory
God it's so painful when something that's so close
Is still so far out of reach
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   I did keep that promise too, I remember
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   It was a beautiful day, the sun beat down
I had the radio on, I was drivin'
Trees flew by, me and Del were singin' little Runaway
I was flyin'
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   And I found that spot where you could just glide down over Mulholland and I wrote her name in the sky and then I just did some freefalling out into nothin'
I just left this world for awhile

            I went through them. With how much is redacted it was quick to get through.

            I didn't detect anything brand new in here, however, it is the first time we are seeing a peek into the investigation done at the Federal level.

           <p>
            At the end you see where the FBI called it an ongoing investigation in 2008 but that they were going to let the State prosecute him.

            He might have actually given them a lot of dirt on people for how easy he got off. But he also got special treatment of course. Fuckin insane man.

            The fact that this man is still alive serves as proof of how pathetic, disgusting, cowardly and ultimately worthless human beings are. The Jews are right to treat goyim as worthless eaters and cattle. They are never going to be proven wrong. Fuck everyone.

             Give it to a higher power, friend. It’s the only way I can get through this. You and the rest of us are proof that there is hope. Your higher power knows what’s up.

               It’s kinda funny because it reflects truth. Putting things in God’s hands doesn’t bother me in the slightest. But there are some actions I can take that are in line with my prayers: respect the others’ right to think for themselves, expose evil, remain calm.
              </p>
              <p>
               You are aware that all matter is made up of energy. Where did that energy come from? What part of your brain has your persona? If we were truly only physical, everything we decide would be mathematical. People wouldn’t change their minds about where to eat lunch, or act on whims, or ever change a bad habit.
              </p>
              <p>
               Take Hope friend. There is a spiritual. And the source is not responsible for this evil, in fact we are meant to be happy. When everyone that may has formed a connection with that creator, perhaps this evil will be brought to a complete end. For now, we should take comfort in knowing that it is being exposed, and will continue to be.
              </p>
              <p>
               Think of it as a bell, signaling to all that wish it, that it is time to let go of this dying system and get ready for a better one, and to reach out for others that may be disposed to live as well.
              </p>
              <p>
               It’s right around the corner. If you look with the right eyes, you can see the wave of evil breaking and washing back where it can from.

                Well, I appreciate your positive outlook and taking the time to write out your perspective. But I think leaving our physical realms outcome to the whims of spirited ideas that have no stake or need to correct our world is a recipe for allowing evil to over take mankind, excuse the stark language.

                 I respect that. For many there is a fine line between waiting on God’s justice and indolence. That is why, IMO, it is critical to find useful actions to go along with my prayer. At the very least, to not BE ASLEEP, like the masses you described in your opening comment.
                </p>
                <p>
                 I found your words poignant, while humorous and true, but also tragic. Whether the malefactor be a Zionist Jew, a Masonic Bonesman, a Beildergerger Luciferian, an Illuminati Banker... they act with impunity, because most people are too busy feeding and entertaining themselves.
                </p>
                <p>
                 But what should we do? Pick up the sword and join the lynch mob? It looks like the time for that has not come yet. Maybe it will come, maybe not. But what if I’m right? I wouldn’t want to be in the street throwing rocks at the Illuminati’s goons on judgement day.
                </p>
                <p>
                 I know, I have pretty wild imagination.
                </p>
                <p>
                 Something tells me that we can both agree... the best we can do is chug away here and keep redpilling others, hoping for the best. When we get down, well there are others here in the same way. I just try to give folks a boost when I notice the despair creeping in. Higher power and prayer help me a lot, for what it’s worth. All the same,... best to you. Hang in there.
