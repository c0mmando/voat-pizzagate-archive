<p>&quot;A key witness in the Madeleine McCann case claimed yesterday that Portuguese police failed to take his evidence seriously. Retired businessman Martin Smith, 64, provided details for an e-fit of the prime suspect after spotting the mystery man carrying a child at 10pm close to where the three-year-old vanished more than six years ago. (...)</p>
<p>Mr Smith, a former Unilever executive, made a statement along with his wife Mary, daughter Aoife and son Peter soon after Madeleine vanished on May 3, 2007. He helped compile e-fits a year later – but the images were not released at the time and were only made public for the first time earlier this week. Speaking from his home in Drogheda, Co Louth, Mr Smith said that the Portuguese police did not seem to think his sighting was significant.</p>
<p>He added: “It looked as if they put 90% credence on the Jane Tanner sighting, maybe that wrong-footed them and they didn’t take our sighting as seriously. I was surprised it took six years to rule out the other sighting.”</p>
<p>He said he has met with Scotland Yard detectives twice over the past 18 months to help them with the new probe. He added: “We‘d all love to see the police get to the bottom of what happened.”</p>
<p>“We think about Madeleine a lot and we would love to see a conclusion to this case. Mr Smith was with his wife, daughter, son, daughter-in-law and two grandchildren on the night that the three year old vanished. The family described the man they saw as white, with short brown hair and of average build and height, aged between 20 and 40.&quot;</p>

<p>“It’s about sustainable sourcing,” says Paul Polman, CEO of Unilever, the company behind over 400 consumer product brands such as Ben &amp; Jerry’s, Lipton and Dove. “Increasingly consumers want to know where and how our products are made.”</p>
<p>Unilever is contributing $5m while the Clinton Giustra Enterprise Partnership, part of the Clinton Foundation, is putting in the other $5m. Clinton Giustra and Acumen, a nonprofit that makes loans or equity investments in social entrepreneurships, will identify or create businesses that will get funding.&quot;</p>

<p>Now let\'s go back to Martin Smith from Doneghal, County of Louth. There is a connection between the place and Bill Clinton:</p>
<p>&quot;‘The President is very interested in local history and information and remembers the most amazing things.</p>
<p>‘I saw his briefing book and all sorts of facts about Louth were included. He told us about his natural parents, his roots and his childhood - his father William Blythe’s father was McBride and his mother was a Cassidy with links in Fermanagh.’
Ireland and the Peace Process are of great interest to President Clinton, according to Mr. O’Dowd.</p>
<p>‘For 228 years it has been the policy of the US government not to interfere in the politics of Ireland, but Bill Clinton took a huge personal risk in becoming involved.
‘The granting of a US visa to Gerry Adams in February 1994 was the turning point. Clinton took a risk and ended the international shutting out of the IRA making the cease fire easier.’</p>
<p>Mr. O’Dowd said that the fact that Dundalk is a border town and had been directly enhanced by the Peace Process both economically and politically, as well as having a large square in the centre of town, swung the visit for Louth to them.
‘The President draws energy from crowds and loves to meet people - he was amazed by the reception in Dundalk,’ said Niall O’Dowd.</p>
<p>‘There is no doubt that he is coming back here. I can see him playing the role of an international statesman.
‘Fundraising has already began for a Clinton Peace Centre at a location along the border.’</p>

<p>Now looking further into this &quot;Clinton Peace Centre&quot;, it opened in 2002:</p>
<p>&quot;Mr Clinton opened the centre in Enniskillen, Co Fermanagh on the site of the 1987 Remembrance Sunday bombing. The IRA killed 11 people and injured 63 more gathered beside the town\'s cenotaph for that year\'s service. A 12th victim, Ronnie Hill, died in December 2000 after spending 13 years in a coma.</p>
<p>The Clinton Centre has been named in tribute to the ex-president\'s efforts for international peace and in recognition of his special role in helping the divided Northern Ireland community towards the Good Friday Agreement. He was to be joined by First Minister Mr David Trimble and Deputy First Minister Mr Mark Durkan. However, Mr Trimble has travelled to London to meet British prime minister Mr Tony Blair over the ongoing sectarian clashes in Belfast.</p>
<p>Mr Clinton last visited Enniskillen in May last year, when he met families bereaved in the bombing and unveiled an inscription on a memorial window of the Peace Centre, which is dedicated to the victims of the blast.</p>
<p>As Mr Clinton arrived at the building, police forcibly removed one of those injured in the bombing from the entrance to the centre and frogmarched him across the road. Mr Jim Dixon was protesting that victims of the bombing had no role in the establishment of the centre.
&quot;Victims have had no input, but they are using the victims to get money for it,&quot; he claimed.&quot;</p>

            "Asked to clarifiy the Clinton Centre’s current financial position and if it received money from a fund called ‘Friends of Clinton Centre’, a spokesman from the Clinton Centre told The Impartial Reporter: “Currently a feasibility study is being undertaken with regard to assessing options for the future utilisation of the Clinton Centre. The social economy hub and the gallery space continue to be fully utilised and generate rent accordingly. In essence this constitutes the income for the Clinton Centre.” A successful Clinton Summer School which gave students from Northern Ireland the opportunity to increase their global awareness by examining sectarianism, segregation and racism with students from Kosovo and America was held for a number of years in the Clinton Centre. However now takes place at the William J. Clinton Leadership Institute at Queen’s University Belfast.

           <p>
            Hostelling International Northern Ireland had a youth hostel on the top two floors of the Clinton Centre for a number of years but they pulled out in December 2012."

            ...and don't forget Crimewatch UK (very popular, high ratings, British version of 'America's Most Wanted', and ironically, used to be co-hosted by Pedo whistleblower victim - allegedly - JILL DANDO) also chose to produce a televised MCCANN SPECIAL the same month that article with the new e-fits, came out.
           </p>
           <p>
            That's some pull, the McCanns have, to warrant an entire show. No other British high profile crime or missing kid scenario has ever prompted such BBC interest.

             And, Clarence Mitchell, the New Labour govt PR guy was sent to be first on the scene when McCann disappeared, and also happened to be first on the scene after the Jill Dando murder. I would be very interested in any investigating that has been done into UK Pizzagate, because I'm sure there is tons of dirt. It's kind of looking like the UK establishment sent over some of theirs to help clean up and cover up in Portugal for some of the US pedo-faction.

              No, you're talking about different suspects.
             </p>
             <p>
              The Irish couple mentioned in OP's article saw ONE man. The two efits that happen to look like the Podesta brothers are NOT based on any other suspects or any other witnesses' accounts. They are based on the description from THIS man and THIS woman of the ONE man they saw. The man makes it clear in this article, the head of the investigation made it clear on the BBC special where the efits were revealed.

               What explanation is both consistent with the facts and makes the minimum number of assumptions?
              </p>
              <p>
               The theory:
              </p>
              <p>
               The investigators hired by the McCanns produced efits from photographs of the Podesta Brothers.
The police sat on the efits because they knew that they were inconsistent with the working theory that there was only single suspect for the abduction, and finally released them in order to give the impression that progress was being made.

                Beats me. Nor do I care. That's clearly what happened. What are the odds statistically that the last person who won the Powerball lottery would win?
               </p>
               <p>
                You think they saw two guys walking down the street at night and used their cyborg infrared binoculo-vision to pick up the mole above the eye of one of them (but got the eye wrong)? You think these were the most unbelievably accurately observant witnesses in the history of crime? Have you ever in your life seen any police sketches/efits that were exact matches for the actual person once he was caught?
               </p>
               <p>
                There is literally no remotely plausible explanation for why both the police and the witnesses would be forced to pretend there was only one young suspect, while still being allowed to release pictures of the two Podesta brothers.
