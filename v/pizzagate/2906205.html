<h1>Natalie\'s Disappearance</h1>
<p>I remember in 2005 all that was on the news was the case of missing <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disappearance_of_Natalee_Holloway">Natalie Holloway</a> in Aruba. This was also because we didn\'t have money to pay for TV so the only channel we could watch was FOX News. It was a 24/7 day media frenzy it seemed. Natalie was from Mountain Brook, Alabama on a Highschool graduation trip in Aruba. </p>
<p>After a recent thread here that mentioned a teen murdered in an Iowa Field and how it could be related to the Elites making a &quot;public offering&quot; of sorts, I instantly thought of the Holloway case. Maybe it was a ritual sacrifice by her parents made all the more powerful by televising it? As you will see there are many very dubious figures involved.</p>
<h1>Her Hometown near Birmingham, Alabama</h1>
<p>Natalee\'s Hometown is Mountain Brook, a suburb of Birmingham, Alabama:</p>
<p>Mountain Brook is also oddly referred to as &quot;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mountain_Brook,_Alabama">The Tiny Kingdom</a>&quot; because of it\'s concentration of wealth. Being the 9th wealthiest place in the US.</p>
<p>Mountain Brook Highschool where Holloway was attending has an active <a href="https://www.mtnbrook.k12.al.us/domain/251">Ping Pong club</a>. Not sure if that\'s common in the US. I never saw a single person play Ping Pong in my time in North America, neither in school nor after in the working world. It\'s much more prevelant in europe.</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jared_Weinstein">Jared Weinstein</a>, aide to President Bush in 2006 also attended MBHS. His parents are jewish, not sure if there\'s a connection to Pedo Weinstein. Since he\'s a kike, most likely there is. Odd anyway that there is a mention of having jewish parents on his wiki page. </p>
<p>Other notable people in Hollywood also attended MBHS like Courtney Cox, Tommy Dewey, and video game designer of the game God of War, etc.</p>
<p>Tommy Dewey was in a Film called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Babymakers">The Babymakers</a>, whose storyline is a man being infertile and recruiting a friend to rob a sperm bank where he once made a donation. Odd...</p>
<p>A TV Series named Jersey Belle was filmed in Mountain Brook. Remember, this is a small town of 20,000 people, not LA. A <a href="https://www.salon.com/2014/08/02/my_life_is_a_bravo_reality_show_how_jersey_belle_smooths_over_my_hometowns_poisonous_history/">Salon article</a> about Mountain Brook by Salon writer Kristine Lloyd starts off with &quot;Alcoholics, pedophiles, bulimics and abusers — all manner of perversion and its attendant coping mechanisms runs rampant through my hometown like the thick curtains of kudzu draped over highway overpasses, gothic and hauntingly beautiful even as it smothers all plant life in its path.&quot;</p>
<h1>Looking at CIA ties to Birmingham, Bay of Pigs Invasion</h1>
<p>On the CIA homepage, there are memorial stories for those who have fallen for the CIA. There are 113 stars on the Memorial Wall for fallen agents, 80 mentioned with names, and 33(!) do not have a name, they have to be kept secret. ODD...</p>
<p>Further on, check <a href="https://www.cia.gov/news-information/featured-story-archive/2016-featured-story-archive/remembering-cias-heroes-ray-baker-shamburger-gray.html">this out</a>. In April 1961, 4 men were killed on a mission in Cuba after their planes were shot down. They were recruited by the CIA to help &quot;topple the Castro Regime.&quot; The CIA website doesn\'t say that this was their job though, it literally says: &quot;Recruits, <strong>apparently</strong>, were told that they would be participating in a secret mission aimed at toppling the Castro regime.&quot;</p>
<p>But it goes on. I was looking for Military activity in Birmingham, Alabama (of which Mountain Brook is a suburb) and what caught my eye was one of those killed: &quot;Pete, a 30-year old pilot in the Alabama Air National Guard, was married with two children. His “day job” was technical inspector at Hayes Aircraft Corporation, which repaired and <strong>modified planes for the US Air Force in Birmingham</strong>, Alabama.&quot; Why is &quot;day job&quot; in apostrophes, what was his real job. Modifying aircraft for trafficking?</p>
<p>But now even further! Leo, Pete’s co-pilot, was a native of Boston and a former flight engineer at Hayes Aircraft Corporation. At the time he was recruited, Leo was <strong>MANAGING TWO PIZZA PARLORS</strong> in the Birmingham area. How do you go from being a flight engineer to managing <em>PIZZA PARLORS</em> to going on a covert mission for the CIA!?! Mere coincidence?</p>
<h1>People surrounding Natalee:</h1>
<p>The primary suspect in all this was Joran van der Sloot, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joran_van_der_Sloot">convicted killer</a> of Stephany Flores Ramírez. He was never found guilty of killing Natalee. If you scroll down <a href="http://www.pensandpatron.com/lists/holloway-disappearance/">here</a>, there\'s a pic of van der Sloot with a messed up left eye.</p>
<p>George &quot;Jug&quot; Twitty, Natalee\'s stepfather has a nephew named Thomas who also happened to be in Aruba at the same time and played poker with van der Sloot the day before.</p>
<p>Beth Twitty, Natalee\'s mom, was in <a href="https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2006/01/natalee200601">Hot Springs</a> Arkansas on the day of her disappearance. Hot Springs is Bill Clinton\'s hometown. After Beth got the phone call from one of the accompanying adults in Aruba letting her know that Natalee didn\'t show up for the flight, she &quot;knew immediately that my daughter had been kidnapped in Aruba.&quot; How do you immediately know that?</p>
<p>Beth became part of Jug\'s social group of hunting buddies and their wives, and today the Twittys\' support network consists of seven couples who call themselves &quot;the <strong>Fabulous Seven</strong>.&quot; Also odd, who outside of elementary school would call their friends group such a name.</p>
<h1>Aruba:</h1>
<p>Natalee\'s parents were in Aruba by 10pm that night, taking a private jet that a friend had arranged.</p>
<p>Gerold Dompig, the deputy police chief in charge of the case, says the biggest obstacle to solving it has been the Twitty family itself. Among other things, Dompig charges that pressure from the family  <a href="https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2006/01/natalee200601">sidetracked</a> the investigation from the outset, forcing the premature arrests of the main suspects and destroying the best chance police had of gathering evidence to solve the case.</p>
<p>Aruban businessman Charles Croes, a former ally said &quot;That girl, Natalee, I wish she\'d stayed home. I hope she\'s found alive there. Because no one would care. No one. The kid is just not worth all this trouble, this heartache. Is Natalee worth it? Is she?&quot; That\'s a harsh thing to say of a kidnapped and most likely murdered girl.</p>
<h1>Common Assholes</h1>
<p>Joe Scarborough and Greta van Susteren were among those who profited from reporting on the case. Trump has mentioned Scarborough in at least one of <a href="https://twitter.com/realdonaldtrump/status/767685048703279104?lang=en">tweets</a>, suggesting he killed his <a href="https://www.businessinsider.de/trump-conspiracy-joe-scarborough-killed-intern-2017-11?r=US&amp;IR=T">intern</a>.</p>
<p>Although making friends quickly with locals, including the Aruba Today Newspaper, seemingly everyone on the island turned on them after a short time. The Twitty\'s were mistreating them, lying as well as being &quot;two faced,&quot; telling locals one story and TV crews another in the interviews.</p>
<p>Seems like not a single normal person is involved in this story and every one of them has skeletons in the closet.</p>
<p>Also, if someone could Archive the CIA link that would be great! I don\'t know how.</p>
<p>That\'s it for now, I know there is a lot more but if I don\'t put this up here now I\'ll never start on the rest. I\'ll be looking closer into the Flight engineer turned Pizza manager.</p>',

            Birmingham is where the KKK killed bombed the church setting off the civil rights movement...am beginning to see a nexus of KKK, hells angels , fascists and pedophilia . Also high high numbers of  police protection ...began seeing this from my home state of NC.Little known fact of NC , Charlotte is the banking capital of US. A couple of large mental hospitals in piedmont, large prisons...I think they are being used for testing of drugs.....used to work in them......Many HQs of Big Pharma in the piedmont or middle ..4th largest employer of big pharma companies...even a HQ of Burroughs Wellcome , connected to Tavistock. Remember Comet Ping Pong had two doors , one said Well , the other Come on the door. So there are areas where pedophilia is rampant and there are usually the same players....Ft. Bragg near central NC has been implicated in MKUltra as well as Duke University...all piedmont NC..More KKK than any other state a couple of years...Used to read waynemadsenreport..he had a co writer , Sylvia Germack, who was also good. She said there was a corridor going through central NC into eastern Tenn. where pedophilia was rampant.My father was in  a pedophile ring in the piedmont with prominent doctors, one  lawyer I know of there...  The western part of NC is where David Koresh recruited people for WACO. My neighbor in the Appalachian mountains lost a son in WACO, a grand daughter lost her fingers in the fire. Another daughter left when her daughter became of age to be raped by David Koresh. She said the building where he lived had three floors ...he lived on the second. The mothers would send their daughters to him when they were the right age. 8 to 12....occ. the mothers. this was ok with the fathers.The fire was mass murder like Jim Jones.Where do the motorcycle clubs and like hells angels fit in? They have nazi insignias in their get ups....Sell Drugs...occ. hired for killings.Recently saw a TV show about biker clubs in California..they had a war and one of the leaders of a warring faction went to Arizona...Mexican biker clubs got mixed in there. selling drugs and children...remember McCain 's group like the clinton foundation there? I am very sorry to skip and jump so much with this information. My son was recently killed and sometimes it gets to me..like now. ..just making this connection though...Watched a video today telling of mind control being used to control Germany and the SS during the war..it states that mind control is something all those experiments were for ..this link starts off with information on physics and harmonics which I did not get..after that the speaker, Dr. Joseph Ferrell has more information than I have ever heard on mind control. I think all this is very connected...

            Joran Van Der Sloot: Then &amp; Now
           </p>
           <p>
            Joran, a native of Aruba, was the person last seen with Natalee Holloway (along with two other local teen boys), and most theories point to him as being involved in her disappearance. One of the most damning clues? His murder of Stephany Flores five years after Natalee’s disappearance. Apparently, Van der Sloot brutally beat and suffocated Flores to death in a Peruvian hotel room after she uncovered Natalee Holloway files on his computer.
           </p>
           <p>
            However, theories about Natalee are just that: theories. We still don’t know what happened to her, and Van der Sloot has never been charged in connection to her disappearance.
           </p>
           <p>
            Today, Van der Sloot is serving a 28-year jail sentence in Peru for Stephany Flores’ murder. And while he is in jail, a lot has changed in his life since Natalee’s disappearance
           </p>
           <p>
            In 2010, exactly five years after Natalee Holloway vanished, Van der Sloot is charged with the murder of Stephany Flores, whom he met at a casino in Peru. Soon after Van der Sloot was caught, he admitted to killing Flores, claiming she “intruded into [his] private life” after he found her reading articles about him on the internet. He later tried to retract his confession, but the judge ruled it valid.
           </p>
           <p>
            Van Der Sloot marries Peruvian woman who sold goods inside the jail in a prison ceremony. She was 7 months pregnant at the time of their wedding. On September 28, 2014, his wife gave birth to a baby girl.
           </p>
           <p>
            Joran van der Sloot remains in prison for the Stephany Flores murder. However, Natalee Holloway’s dad is still working to solve her case, and a new lead makes Joran a primary suspect once again.
           </p>
           <p>
            They are still trying to pin it on him.  The evidence just isn't there imo.  So they stuck him with the Flores crime to make him look like a killer.

             Beat me to the punch on their dating game!  I have always wondered if they had the same connections.  There was talk that Ramsey sold her off to some elites at that Christmas party.  Wonder if Beth and Hubby did the same.  That crime has always bothered me.  I sat glued to my tv almost every night.  So sad.

               There was talk he brought her to that Christmas Party and they did horrible things to her and she died.  But who knows. He lost big money I think and had to make it up somehow.

            Thank you!  This girl was so beautiful, and full of life.  We try to stay caught up with her story.  No matter how much a person 
hears of this evil, it's still shocking and horrifying.   Everyone in this sub does such an amazing job making sure these 
Angels are never forgotten.  God bless you!

              I agree it's an oddity!  I also believe that pizza baking Italians will survive this :)  Once people become 
smart about what's out there, they'll be able to discern the evil that lurks behind the scenes.
              <br/>
              It's really important work being done here!

             No but seriously basically every disapperance in the news, Can be traced back to this sort of thing. Admittedly...I didn't read the post, But that's just what it is.

              I've heard a lot of negative comments on the choice of the name.  I grew up in a pizza house, 
and none of this went on there.  I don't take it to heart.
Back in the day, skating rinks, pizza/burger joints, etc. made for massive opportunities for 
child abuse, because there was a lot of shame attached to the subject.  It was hushed up.
