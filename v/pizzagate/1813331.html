<p>In 1988 during the &quot;satanic panic&quot; of the late 80s and early 90s, (a term coined to discredit the exposers), Geraldo Rivera did a special on satanism.  The Freemason, &quot;Catholic&quot; crypto Jew GR is a tabloid journalist (like his cohort Oprah), and he does his job of diluting a substantive topic with distractions (blaming heavy metal music,  exorcism, etc.).

<p>43:16 - McMartin Preschool Case.  MY NOTE (from Wikipedia)) -- Accusations were made in 1983. Arrests and the pretrial investigation ran from 1984 to 1987, and the trial ran from 1987 to 1990. After six years of criminal trials, no convictions were obtained, and all charges were dropped in 1990. When the trial ended in 1990 it had been the longest and most expensive criminal trial in American history.</p>
<p>45:12 - Kahtleen Sorensen.  MY NOTE:  Ms. Sorensen was a very outspoken advocate of the child victims and exposed satanism on Nebraska Public Television.  She paid with her life when satanists allegedly assassinated her in a motor vehicle accident (arranging for a car to plow into hers on a Nebraska highway).

            There was a "Satanic Panic" back in the early 90's. Rumors of Satanic abuse were making the rounds, and internet trolls "debunked" it with a meme called "Satanic Panic". Shit was happening back then too, and the succeeded in the cover up. Not this time.
