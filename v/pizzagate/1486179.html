<p>As terrible as these atrocities are to us, to Soros and the Clintons and the Saudis and Chinese and many more who they deal with, it\'s just business. These people aren\'t sitting around a cauldron all week cooking up a witches brew, they\'re making deals. The cauldron is on the weekends.</p>
<p>I honestly wonder if Hillary really did eat a dead person or two and that\'s why she\'s showing signs of Kuru. Maybe. But eating dead people isn\'t her main motivation, most likely. It\'s just a weird thing she did that time back in college with the Satanists or on a weekend at the Podesta\'s or whatever. Yes she\'s evil, but she\'s not stupid. Neither is Soros, although he\'s probably senile as FBIanon says. They will make stupid mistakes, but not everything they do is motivated by a weird fetish for being super evil (probably). It\'s just business.</p>
<p>Here\'s the reason I think we need to look at it this way. If we start seeing these people as dealmakers, then it\'ll make figuring them out way easier. Like, again, FBIanon said, follow the money.</p>
<p>This backwards-ass way of looking for clues in people\'s basement is even beyond Alex Jones level wackoness. I\'m not saying there\'s nothing to it, just that we\'re wasting time. We need to act fast and get to the facts that will prosecute, not get angry about the horrors that these people are capable of. Imagine the worst thing, and they will do it. They\'ve done it, and they\'ll do it again if it means $1 more for them. Yes, it\'s horrible. That\'s what mafias do. Now lets move on to the money.</p>
<p>Basically what we have to do is start breaking down how much money was spent by whom, on what, when, and what happened because of it. That\'s really it. We need to start at the beginning and track where money went, what for, and if we can put together a good case, then all this work and disgust will accomplish something.</p>

            Mario,
Can you change the name of the post.  It isn't getting upvoted.  Maybe something tying the Clinton Foundation in with the Mafia concept?  This is a great post, and it needs attention.  That Clintongate subverse is dead.  #Pizzagate is where it is hot.  We need to bring the foundation more into the conversation on pizza.  FBIanon knew where to lead us to for the evidence.

            I want to dig into the Clinton's and ties to Geo scientists as well. FBI Anon mentioned this and I think it's got legs. Control the weather and you can control nations. I don't know how I feel about Geo engineering  but I don't dispel anything anymore.

            Surely there has to be public records of all charitable associations? I'm just too time poor and clueless as to where to start searching. I believe we could put a lot of pieces into place with civil wars, donations and The Clinton Family Mafia. Not a doubt in my mind.

            I was trying to find yearly breakdowns of CF donors but all my searches seemed to bring up 2015/16. I'd love to be able to pull up a certain year and then corroborate that data with world events. If anyone can help?

            Well written, well said. I think one of the biggest trails to follow is the rise of Boko Harem and Clinton's deals in Nigeria. I also think follow wherever Bill Gates has operated with the Clinton's and you'll find civil war, displaced people, unethical vaccination programs and GMO farm implementation. Ripe for trafficking.

            The photo layout of this site is very similar to that of Soros' Open Society (or whatever it's called).  And check out the picture of the girl,  her dress is just a bit too revealing.  Really?

            Larry Nichols told us that Hillary's father was part of the Chicago Mafia, right?  And that is why Bill married her?  Has this been discussed yet?
           </p>
           <p>
            I think someone said that Larry had said before that if things ever got out it would bring the whole govt. down.
           </p>
           <p>
            Time to start watching those Larry Nichol interviews with AJ.  I know he said he gave Bill a copy of Mein Kampf and told him about the part of lying to the people until they believed it.  And, then, after Bill won the governorship of Arkansas, he called Larry over to give him a christmas present.  Larry was hoping it was going to be a Cadillac, and it was a signed copy of Mein Kampf.  Not signed by Hitler, but by Bill Clinton!!!!
           </p>
           <p>
            These people are evil.
           </p>
           <p>
            I have Larry's cell phone number, anyone up for calling him (he gave it out one day on AJ's show when they were working to fight election fraud).

            The money is the "hardest" evidence because it has a trail. They are very good at it and had a roughly 40 year head start. But, it leaves the brightest trail. A lot of the other evidence being reported is unfortunately curcumstantial. Unless we can tie the money to the circumstances...we won't have anything credible enough to convince the majoity of the public. So we wont be lopped into wack conspirator nut jobs relying on fake news. We have to convince our mothers and fathers, who have grown up believing that NYT and WAPO are truth. When they are actually full of shit. Its the older generation that has power. They are in charge. We have to be better than them to be heard. The implications of this are so serious that it could re write history and destroy the way of life we have come to know.
We all knew there was something wrong with world. Its our time to take over...we better do it right or we are going to start another whole history of bullshit.

            Right on man.  Even better, start doing citizen audits (someone just posted an audit of Brock's Media Matters and I think it's slick as shit) on each shady unit of this organization.  Take them down via the IRS, like Al Capone.  Eventually, in the face of serious fines or jail time, one of the weak links will break the chain of silence and we'll catch the bigger fish.
