            You guys for protection only need to say..
'I plead the blood of the Lamb ( Jesus) a double thorny hedge of protection and a tall mighty wall of fire over me and my entire family'. This is scripture. Whether you are a believer or not, whether you believe in Jesus or not, the angels in heaven move to protect us at His name and the demons we are fighting against recognize the mighty name of Jesus ..and they flee.
The blood of the Lamb is essentially where The celebration of Passover comes from. Also invoke Psalm 91 which is all about God's protection.

            If you go through his youtube channel videos in chronological order, you will see a major transformation. I was shocked. I'm considering buying his book, but I'm so broke I can't right now. This guy needs help, and quickly.

            It's not about assuming that "anyone can just pack up and move," Einstein, it's about assuming that most people would get the Hell out of harm's way when they are in fear of imminent death or great bodily harm.  Most people would not sit inside their home and wait for the toxins or radiation to which they think they are being exposed to kill them.
           </p>
           <p>
            I have taken time to watch some of his videos and read about him.  I would love to see someone take his claims seriously and investigate the father's property for the simple reason that such action would put closure on his claims, one way or another.  But in the meanwhile his current situation, if in fact he's really being exposed to radiation at his home by third parties, could have been avoided by simply getting the Hell up and getting out of danger.  He has a web following.  He has readers.  I assume he must know some people.  There are comments all over the Internet but yet he's in his videos, staying home inside his purportedly toxic home, not moving out of harm's way, and just crying for help.
           </p>
           <p>
            Something ain't right.  It does not make sense that he's stuck in his personal microwave oven, purportedly created by "them," and yet he's chosen to stay there.  I haven't taken time to see if Shurter is fundraising or crowd-sourcing online, but I am definitely questioning his competency right now and things do not look good for him.  HE NEEDS HIS FRIENDS WITH HIM.  Is anyone close to him able to help take care of him?  He needs to get the Hell out of wherever he is, otherwise, if the radiation exposure is real, then he's just contributing to his own harm.

            Look this could be 100% legit, I never ruled that out. On the same hand it could be a fucking paranoid delusion, you just can't rule that out. What really surprises me is the lack of an opposing voice on the comments to his videos.

             Okay, I just watched a couple of his videos and he says "they" are irradiating his house.  So, um, why stay there?  I have never heard of this guy and he seems stressed.  But if "they" (whomever they are) know where he is and they're torturing him with radiation, then why not just go somewhere where they cannot get you?   I'm not saying whether his symptoms are or are not due to third-party activity, but what I do know is that if I were situated in a place where 'they" could get to me, and "they" knew where I was and were torturing me, I'd get the heck out of the known location and go someplace safe.  That's all I got, for now, 'cause I never heard of this guy til now so cannot comment on the works he's done.

              It could be finances stopping him or he may be being watched and followed.
I did watch one of his recent videos and noticed a pretty annoying hum in it.

              I tend to believe him.
He does need some sort of protection.

            Omg. You know who else is being attacked? You know Victurus Libertas that fights Pizzagate/pedogate and does AMA with sources? He's being targeted. He sounds terrible! He said he's burning like he's being microwaved. But, what's worse is that his mind is foggy, he's confused and he can't think. I couldn't believe how bad he sounded!

            Description: 
Published on May 15, 2017. Folks, Thank you for your continued support, love and prayers.. Please continue to pray for the both of us.  I never knew what the term targeted individuals meant until now. I have empathy for all those that have been targeted by the deep state for telling the truth and exposing  evil. Pray for all those that have the courage to take on the swamp creatures.

            Oh, the DRAMA!  If he's so skinny, why's he all covered up so we can't see his bones poking out?  His face certainly looks fleshed out.
           </p>
           <p>
            He looked FINE on the recent video I watched.
