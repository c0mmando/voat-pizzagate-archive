<p>We have read about Laura Silsby and others trafficking 33 children in Haiti toward the Dominican Republic in 2010 where she had &quot;rented&quot; a hotel for an anticipated 100 &quot;orphans.&quot;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>What hotel would put up with this scheme?</h2>
<p>The <a href="http://archive.is/umWlX">Costa Liza Hotel, in Cabarete, Puerto Plata,</a> which was/is owned by the <strong>Catholic Diocese of the Dominican Republic.</strong>  It has gone by a few names:</p>
<ul>
<li>Costa Liza Beach Resort</li>
<li>The Education and Training Center in Cabarete </li>
<li>Centro de Capacitación in Cabarete</li>
<li>Fundación Innovación</li>
<li>Innovation Foundation</li>
</ul>
<p>A priest is quoted in the &quot;Holly Tree&quot; article below that it was a 3-star hotel converted in 2006 to a &quot;retreat&quot; for &quot;DR church staff&quot; and at the same time a school for tech/training and language classes for economically disadvantaged youth, both run by the &quot;Innovation Foundation.&quot; </p>
<p>But was it actually <strong>a public hotel with children on-site?</strong>  Other <strong>links make the Costa Liza Hotel look like a child sex trafficking brothel.</strong></p>
<p>At the bottom of the article there is a link to a <a href="http://archive.is/PixiQ">2008 forum post</a> about <strong>language lessons for tourists at the &quot;old&quot; hotel.</strong>  The link to the lessons is dead.  It\'s strange as it includes the words &quot;Fundacion Innovacion hotel room,&quot; if it was supposedly a retreat for church staff:  <a href="https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4299/36140053911_2a9df4b18b_o.png">Screen capture</a></p>
<p>So I put www.cabarete-cabarete.org into the Wayback Machine and got this startling website, seeming to contradict the quote by the priest:</p>
<p>In 2006 there was <a href="https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4295/35449782054_17bb72e5b7_o.png">a picture of a volunteer with children in front of a bed,</a> with a request for volunteers at this vocational training school for local youth:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20060522073453/http://www.cabarete-cabarete.org:80/cabarete/">http://web.archive.org/web/20060522073453/http://www.cabarete-cabarete.org:80/cabarete/</a></li>
</ul>
<p>In 2009 they advertized as <strong>a public hotel and school:</strong></p>
<p>&quot;Fundación Innovación is a non profit running a tourism school [for local youth] in Cabarete...With Fundación Innovación, you can:  Stay in one of our 44 rooms...&quot;</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20090311164017/http://www.cabarete-cabarete.org:80/">https://web.archive.org/web/20090311164017/http://www.cabarete-cabarete.org:80/</a></li>
</ul>
<p>The article also notes Laura Silsby owns property in &quot;the hamlet of Yagua Magante section of the town of Gaspar Hernandez, Espaillat province.&quot;</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://thehollytree.blogspot.com/2010/02/catholic-diocese-in-dominican-republic.html?m=1">http://thehollytree.blogspot.com/2010/02/catholic-diocese-in-dominican-republic.html?m=1</a> archive <a href="http://archive.is/Ntk5T">http://archive.is/Ntk5T</a></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The UK\'s Sunday Times reported Silsby may even have <strong>purchased the Cabarete hotel,</strong> despite her severe financial problems:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Silsby had visited the Dominican Republic and Haiti in December and appeared to have chosen a former hotel in the northern Dominican resort of Cabarete as a possible refuge for Haitian children.</p>
<p>It is not yet clear whether she succeeded in buying the property, but she allegedly told Haitian police that was where she was taking the children. Her father, John Sander, has told reporters that the project was &quot;just in the making&quot;.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4317/35440572954_780ded8b29_o.png">Screen capture</a></li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Did the Sunday Times have poor information?  I wonder.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Who is behind the Innovation Foundation?</h2>
<p>I don\'t know.  <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20070205032925/http://www.cabarete-cabarete.org:80/cabarete/component/option,com_wrapper/Itemid,32/">This Innovacion Foundacion tab</a> indicates funding by &quot;Cap Amitie&quot; in Switzerland, link:</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I searched for <strong>Fundacion Innovacion Cabarete,</strong> and while I do not know if this is located at the &quot;old hotel,&quot; the first result was <strong>a Cabarete partner of Friends of the Orphans,</strong> a.k.a. Nuestros Pequeños Hermanos, a.k.a. Nos Petits Frères et Soeurs, the Haiti orphanage that gave Silsby 33 children:</p>

<h2>Cabarete is known for sex trafficking</h2>
<p>Cabarete, known for <a href="http://archive.is/QnxU3">partying, water sports, and prostitution,</a> was listed second for sex tourism in a State Department human rights report in 2010:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://archive.is/2K7g">http://archive.is/2K7g</a></li>
</ul>
<p>&quot;Coastal towns&quot; are noted to be child sex trafficking locations in the DR, in a 2010 SD trafficking report:</p>

</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>From 2008-2013, the DR\'s highest Catholic leader was a major CSA perpetrator in the tiny country</h2>
<p>The Vatican\'s Ambassador to the Dominican Republic from 2008 - 2013, <strong>Archbishop Jozef Wesolowski,</strong> preyed on many children there.  One of his child providers got caught, <strong>deacon Francisco Javier Occi Reyes.</strong>  This just adds to the shadiness of the Silsby crimes, as the DR church leadership would have been fine with anything.  </p>
<p>The NYTimes article below also mentions <strong>DR priest Rev. Wojciech Gil abused children there in recent years.</strong></p>
<p>The articles are almost unreadable:</p>
<ul>
<li>NYTimes:  <a href="http://archive.is/YGQny">http://archive.is/YGQny</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Archbishop Jozef Wesolowski was caught with <strong>100,000 files of CSA images including videos, evidence of 45,000 deleted images, and evidence of accomplices.</strong>  He dropped dead in the Vatican at only 67, prior to any criminal trials.</p>

</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>\'Police Involved in 90% of Dominican Republic Organized Crime Cases\'</h2>
<p>The article does not mention child sex trafficking, but we can assume the police are involved: </p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://archive.is/GkBJU">http://archive.is/GkBJU</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Suspicious Cabarete disappearance:</p>
<p>The family of American tennis pro and surfer Darryl Fornatora, who disappeared <strong>during a vacation to Cabarete</strong> in 2016, say evidence suggests <strong>corruption and a cover-up, possibly by local authorities:</strong></p>

</ul>
<p>By the way, I came across a &quot;Dominican Republic tourist body count&quot; which is pretty telling about the role of police on the island:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://archive.is/d0vas">http://archive.is/d0vas</a></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I\'ll just leave this here.  This needs digging.  I have a bad feeling about both Silsby-related properties, whether rented or purchased.</p>

            deacon Francisco Javier Occi Reyes.

           This just adds to the shadiness of the Silsby crimes, as the DR church leadership would have been fine with anything.

            I am withdrawing this thread until I get more confirmation of the information in this blog article by "Holly Tree," as there may actually be two converted hotels in Cabarete, run by the Innovation Foundation, where children may be/have been at risk:
           </p>
           <ul>
            <li>
             <a href="http://archive.is/Ntk5T">
              http://archive.is/Ntk5T
             </a>
            </li>
           </ul>
           <p>
            The Catholic church leased Silsby a hotel in Cabarete that was being used as a vocational training and language school for underprivileged youth, as a vacation hotel for Catholic church staff, and both were run by the Innovation Foundation.
           </p>
           <p>
            The blogger linked to a forum that identified the old Costa Liza Hotel in Cabarete as providing language lessons for tourists, and run by the Innovation Foundation.  Putting the dead link  www.cabarete-cabarete.org through Archive.org, it was shown to have been, between 2006-2009 when the archive stops, a vocational training school for underprivileged youth, with language classes, and a resort for random volunteers to stay there, and both run by the Innovation Foundation:

           </ul>
           <p>
            There are no addresses that I can understand, so I'm not sure if we're looking at two former hotels that house vacationing adults with poor schoolchildren in Cabarete, operated by Innovation Foundation, with only one linked to Laura Silsby, or only one hotel --- and that they're one and the same.
           </p>
           <p>
            Pictures:
           </p>
           <p>
            I just saw this photograph of the former hotel owned by the church:
           </p>
           <ul>
            <li>
             <a href="http://archive.is/vgF7I">

             </a>
            </li>
           </ul>
           <p>
            It does not look like the Costa Liza Hotel, that later housed/still houses(?) a school and non-profit volunteer hotel:
           </p>
           <ul>
            <li>
             <a href="http://archive.is/umWlX">

             </a>
            </li>
           </ul>
           <p>
            This might be worse than I thought.
           </p>
           <p>
            If anyone knows the area and/or knows Spanish and can figure out the coordinates of these places, or anything to show they are different or the same, etc., let me know.  Thanks.

            Would like to mention ex-Secretary of State, Bilderberg member, Council of 300 (NWO) member, HRC mentor and confidant Henry Kissinger owns a compound in the Dominican Republic. It has been kept secret for decades. This past Christmas HRC was alleged to have spent the holidays there. Rumors of rituals by locals were made but it never broke through. I think if people research Kissinger and the Dominican Republic you might find interesting connections to Silsby.

             I agree there must be human sacrifice going on in the DR.  But the first article doesn't even give a year, even a decade, age of victim, who reported it, nothing.  I mean, was it in the 1600's on the site of the present Punta Cana Resort?  That is very annoying of them.  But that is why I didn't include it, I don't think it's fair to the owners to carelessly suggest that.  Please let us know if you find anything.

            Haitian translators who worked with the detained American missionaries say the group may have looked for help from a man they believe was a Haitian policeman and a Dominican official
           </p>
           <p>
            On Tuesday night CNN went to the jail to talk once again to the American Baptists. They asked them if they knew a Haitian and a Dominican policeman. Initially they declined to answer that question and instead they responded by breaking into singing hymns. Later team leader Laura Silsby conceded she knew a man she described as a Haitian policeman she also said she knew another man she described as a Dominican coast guard.
           </p>
           <p>
            They trusted the Americans, they said, because they arrived with the recommendation of a Baptist minister, Philippe Murphy, who runs an orphanage in the area. A woman who answered the door at Mr. Murphy’s house said he had gone to Miami. But she also said that he did not know anything about the Americans. ”
An important part of the story in that a former orphan in Mr. Murphy’s orphanage was setting this up and the possibility of name-dropping can’t be dismissed here. Mr. Murphy was not involved in Laura’s mission, but these locals did not pull that name out of nowhere-it shows the kind of opportunist that Silsby really is.
           </p>
           <p>
            They recruited children door to door and also On Tuesday Jan. 26, a local orphanage worker fluent in English acting on behalf of the Baptists convened nearly the entire village of about 500 people on a dirt soccer pitch to present the missionary’s offer.
           </p>
           <p>
            “When questioned by telephone, the priest told Listin Diario that the property on which until 2006 ran a three-star hotel, was converted into a school where he taught technical courses and language classes to economically disadvantaged youth and a retreat for church staff members of the Catholic flock of several towns in the country. Both the school and withdrawal are operated by the Innovation Foundation.
           </p>
           <p>
            Similarly, the priest Hernandez Rodriguez showed he has reports indicating that Mrs. Laura Silsby, head of the group of Americans held in Haiti on Saturday while traveling in a bus with 33 Haitian children, aged between two months and 12, bought land in the hamlet of Yagua Magante section of the municipality of Gaspar Hernandez, Espaillat province.
           </p>
           <p>
            The seller of property stated that the main principles of the Catholic Church hierarch of the Diocese Gaspar Hernandez, Joba Arriba, Jamao, Pedro Garcia and Puerto Plata, demurred to rent the premises, under the pretext that was used for manufactured Training Center and the hotel retreat, but they say the urgency of finding a place to house orphans and homeless children in Haiti, the priest agreed to rent for six months, forty-five rooms for a total of U.S. $ 7,000.00 per month.
           </p>
           <p>
            This from another article
           </p>
           <p>
            The Dallas Morning News quoted Terry Michaelson, an attorney for Central Valley Baptist Church, who said he had given Silsby $7,000 to help pay for the first month's rent for the orphanage she planned to set up in the Dominican Republic.

            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            “”A few days before their arrests, the ten volunteers attempted to take 40 children to the Dominican Republic, the officer,who requested not to be identified for fear of reprisals, told CNN on Monday. The officer thwarted the group’s plan after he was alerted by a concerned citizen about the bus loaded with Haitian children.”
           </p>
           <p>
            “He added that a policeman believed the group was trying to sell the children for $10,000 each, an allegation denied by the church members.
           </p>
           <p>
            This article explains Silsby's run for children better then any I have read. A lot more info and names dropped
Will try to start looking up stuff when I get home from work, maybe tomorrow if hard night
           </p>
           <p>
            Plenty of stuff to look up with exposethecriminals links and this one

             Yes, huge, so tragic! I did include the Wesolowski case in the thread.  It's very significant.  The thread is long so since you didn't see that part, I edited it to add some spaces and lines so the info is easier to see for everyone.  If I didn't write this, it would be hard for me not to miss something if I read it.
