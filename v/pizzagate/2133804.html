<p>Introduction : About 4 years ago, I came across some haunting and disturbing photos of ragged Victorian era children, sentenced to prison and lashings for stealing food or warm clothing.  It led me down a rabbit hole of human trafficking, legalized child rape /prostitution, child labor and its wretched abuses, and the complicity of the elites.  The predators were found throughout Victorian society, those at the highest levels of law enforcement, parliament, judicial branches, and even royalty. Today we are called the Pizzagate Movement, back then they were known as the Purity Movement. Link shows similar pictures of the children that triggered this research 4 years ago: (<a href="http://www.oldpolicecellsmuseum.org.uk/page_id__538_path__0p75p312p316p.aspx">http://www.oldpolicecellsmuseum.org.uk/page_id__538_path__0p75p312p316p.aspx)</a>) </p>
<p>Summary: History repeats itself:
The Purity Movement Activists that fought for the abused and trafficked children left us a game plan that changed the course of history. The world is a safer place for children because of their contributions. This is relevant to the Pizzagate Movement because tt proves beyond a shadow of doubt that a small and fanatical group of people can fight an elite, wealthy, network of pedos and win.   If not for the work of: William B. Stead, Josephine Butler, Catherine Booth, Dr. Barnard, and so many, many, more, it would be normal and even socially acceptable today to rape a child.  It would be socially acceptable and legal to sell a child\'s virginity as a cure to syphilis.  These tireless activists are responsible for the idea that children deserve a &quot;childhood.&quot;  Our cultural norms of today are due to the battle that was known as the Purity Movement during the Industrial Revolution and the Victorian Era. Factories became known as Satanic Mills and the public awareness and outrage grew.  During the industrial and Victorian eras, children were considered fresh meat by elites and pimps who benefited from the cheap labor and sexual exploitation.  The abuses were horrific, legal, institutionalized and even accepted by mainstream Victorian society.The aristocracy class was neck deep in the depravity and abuse of these children.   None of this is exaggerated, in fact, the photos and testimony will bring tears to your eyes.  
</p>
<p>(Rule 1) 
I am sharing this because it relates to Pizzagate, since it demonstrates a historical precedence that elites (members of parliament, judges, law enforcement, and aristocrats) have been abusing and trafficking children for profit for hundreds of years. It demonstrates that laws can be changed and public pressure and awareness can force the hand of reluctant and even complicit leaders to curb the abuses.  It is also useful, to understand the strategies that the activists used when fighting against industrial age corporations, royalty, MP\'s, police, legislation, and judges.  Finally, the activists won, and how they won is relevant. These activists changed the course of history and of our society today. 
The links below will show the strategies that the Pedo. networks used: such as legislation to protect the predators, the targeting of orphan and poor children by traffickers, the complicity of the elites in law enforcement, and in positions of authority, It will show the media black out of the time and what the activists did to circumvent it.  These links will expose the strategies of the Pedo Cabal, but it will also demonstrate how the Purity Activists fought back.</p>
<p>Victorian / Industrial Society the links below will demonstrate the cultural norms and abuses that were common in Victorian Society. Link below will show pics of children and their abusers.

&quot;Harrowing pictures of a pregnant ten-year-old prostitute and tots begging for money capture the heart-breaking poverty of Victorian street children. Eminent Victorian men would unashamedly discuss their attraction to young girlsHowever a scandal in nineteenth century England caused the government to raise the age of consent and tackle child prostitution. The age of consent was then raised from 13 to 16. During this period, the term white slavery came to be used throughout Europe and the United States to describe prostituted children.&quot;

&quot;Sarah Golding was poorly and so she stopped her machine. James Birch, the overlooker, knocked her to the floor. She got up as well as she could. He knocked her down again. Then she was carried to her house...she was found dead in her bed. There was another girl called Mary...she knocked her food can to the floor. The master, Mr. Newton, kicked her and caused her to wear away till she died. There was another, Caroline Thompson, who was beaten till she went out of her mind. The overlookers used to cut off the hair of any girl caught talking to a lad. This head shaving was a dreadful punishment. We were more afraid of it than any other punishment for girls are proud of their hair.&quot;- An interview with an unknown woman who worked in a cotton factory as a child (1849)</p>
<p>&quot;Children worked under deplorable conditions and were being exploited by the industrialists. A picture was painted of the “dark satanic mill” where children as young as five and six years old worked for twelve to sixteen hours a day, six days a week without recess for meals in hot, stuffy, poorly lit, overcrowded factories to earn as little as four shillings per week.&quot;- Tuttle, 2001</p>
<p>The Heros who changed the world:</p>
<p>1.Josephine butler:
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josephine_Butler">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josephine_Butler</a>
&quot;While investigating the effect of the Acts, Josephine had been appalled that some of the prostitutes were as young as 12, and that there was a slave trade of young women and children from England to the continent for the purpose of prostitution. A campaign to combat the trafficking led to the removal from office of the head of the Belgian Police des Mœurs, and the trial and imprisonment of his deputy and 12 brothel owners, who were all involved in the trade. Josephine fought child prostitution with help from the campaigning editor of the Pall Mall Gazette, William Thomas Stead, who purchased a 13-year-old girl from her mother for £5. The subsequent outcry led to the Criminal Law Amendment Act 1885 which raised the age of consent from 13 to 16 years of age and brought in measures to stop children becoming prostitutes. Her final campaign was in the late-1890s, against the Contagious Diseases Acts which continued to be implemented in the British Raj.
2.Catherine Booth</p>

<p>William T. Stead:</p>
<p>&quot;1876, Stead joined a campaign to repeal the Contagious Diseases Act, befriending the feminist Josephine Butler.[11] The law was repealed in 1886.[11]&quot;
(<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/W._T._Stead">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/W._T._Stead)</a>)</p>
<p>&quot;William Thomas Stead (5 July 1849 – 15 April 1912) was an English newspaper editor who, as a pioneer of investigative journalism, became a controversial figure of theVictorian era.[1][2] Stead published a series of hugely influential campaigns whilst editor of The Pall Mall Gazette, and he is best known for his 1885 series of articles, The Maiden Tribute of Modern Babylon, written in support of a bill to raise the age of consent from 13 to 16, dubbed the &quot;Stead Act. Stead\'s \'new journalism\' paved the way for the modern tabloid in Great Britain.
-Eliza Armstrong Case / Maiden tribute of Modern Babylonn order to demonstrate the truth of his revelations, he arranged the &quot;purchase&quot; of Eliza Armstrong, the 13-year-old daughter of a chimney sweep. </p>
<p>Conclusions:
-It took at least 24 years for the activists to raise the age of consent. Let that sink in, from the first law on the books dated 1861, to the law which finally raised the age of consent to 16, it took 24 years of diligent work. We need a long game.
History is repeating itself and history has left us a game plan to stop it.  So where does the pizzagate movement go in the long run? How do we stay relevant and effective? What lessons can we learn from the purity movement? What can we learn from the Franklin Credit Union Scandal?</p>
<p>My next post will concentrate on the strategies and tactics employed by the purity movement against the pedo elite.Otherwise this post will be endless!  I am sorry if the post is too long. I have mounds of links and I have put together a timeline.  Four years ago this topic was MUCH easier to research.  Much has been scrubbed from the internet since.  
</p>
<p>It is my wish that this post can spread some hope that Pizzagate is NOT a lost cause. We can change the world. Our predecessors did it and so could we! It is my hope that this post inspires fresh ideas and new tactics. Above all, I hope that we can unify this movement,since I sincerely believe that heaven is supporting this movement and that we are fighting the gates of hell literally.  May angels protect the children and the movement. Amen</p>',

            YES.  The political aspect must be left out.  We already are divided enough as it is because of their doings.  Yes, pure stories like presented here, will tear into people's hearts.  We must do it with care and with clever memes and slogans.  This is how we will reach those that believe they have already been victimized.  We may not agree with their politics but we should understand their loss.  I KNOW, I know, I am still working on that.

            Yes, I do agree as well that it is hard to trust anyone now, knowing what we now know.  They have lied to us and hidden so much.  A Shadow Govt.  No, they do not deserve our trust.  I give trust very carefully now..  They must earn it.

            . What a Phenomenal Post!  It tore art my heart reading about small little children (still called infants) at the age of 3 to 5 being used to crawl into small places, such as in sweatshops (which we now have) where we now have children sewing clothes for children.  Satan's Sewers.  It is happening again.  They are turning the world upside down and if we don't stop them they will bring us back to Square One, the Victorian Age.  No human being should should have to endure such hardships and horrible cruelty, least of all our precious little children.  Living 30 in one little room with no candle to even provide light.  What I see now is the beginning of the same things happening  in our society all over again, with some ok with what is going on in the world.  This is how it slowly creeps in, and we are all of a sudden at their mercy again.   I also feel that we have a greater opportunity now with the internet at hand. We must protect the INTERNET.   Also you point out songs, memes, poems, etc.  I think this is a really great idea.  If you have a band or small group write some songs that really speak to  what is going on in the world.  Remember the Protest Songs?  This is where we have a chance to grab the attention of the young.  The young, the very ones that are in danger again.  I await your next post and know it will be as meaningful and soulful as this one.  You have a Heart of Gold.

             What is so interesting is I have recently seen articles comparing The technology age to the industrial revolution. Yes they are trying to repeat history! The stories I have heard about apple factories in China and child labor in India......very sad.
Your comment makes me so happy! Because yes we have the internet, even if they take away the internet we still have strategies to over come the pedo cabal. Yes we need songs, and slogans, and poems....sky's the limit. Everyone should contRibute their talent. Some are creative, some can speak publicly, some can hand out flyers, some research, some organize events, some make tshirts and bumper stickers. Some can draft laws, some can interview victims, some can act as eyes and ears and document secrets. Every little bit counts. In this case money is NOT everything :) in fact money would complicate it. We all have a way to contribute, god has given each of us our own unique light to fight the darkness. The pedo cabal will lose, history has a way to repeat it self, and we need to know that pedos will lose god has revealed this history despite the cabals efforts to hide it.

              Yes, you are right that history will repeat itself if we get too complacent and let others do our thinking, but history can also repeat itself for us too, in that we can win just like the Peace Movement did during the Victorian Era.  If they won, we can win too.  We have to keep spreading the information on the internet, but we also must sometimes tear ourselves away to do good old fashioned activism like we always have in the past.  It always works in the end.  We can appeal  to our brothers and sisters to help the children of the world by letting them know that we are all under the attack of the corporations and those that wish to take us back to those infamous days when THEY were in control.  This is our country and we must take it back before it is too late.  Not take it back from the Immigrants but from The Global Cabal.  We can even get the Immigrants to join in with us, for they will be even worse off than they are now.  Believe me they know they are the dividing factor.

                Believe me if we approach this in the right way, and not making them feel they are the problem, but that what we have done in their country in order to force them to leave and that now that they are here, we must fight together.  We will never reach our goal fighting among ourselves.  That is what they have been trying to get us to do since they cam over on the Mayflower.  I am an Immigrant and my parents became Citizens almost exactly 5 yrs after they got their papers.  This is the problem, now they are waiting at least 9 years to get their papers.  Also we have too many being brought in just to cover certain tech jobs.  Certain politicians have been trying to up the number of these people in order to cater to the Corporations.  THIS MUST STOP NOW.  This is what is causing our problems.  Our Laws are Not Being Enforced and some have been changed for the Corporations.

            Great post and you bring up a vital topic. Where do we see the Movement in 2 years from now? 5 years, 10? We absolutely need to start looking at the long game. I think taking a closer look at the 24 year period from 1861 to 1885 that it took for those laws to originally pass would be a great starting point. What significant figures or politicians at the time were in favor of raising the consent to 16? Was it as monopolized as today, or worse? Without Internet, how was the movement able to truly recruit and grow? What additional relevant literature can we find from those times on the Purity movement? How were they getting their voices heard through all of the primitive fake news? We need a time line built of that period to better understand the events. Just a few questions off the top. Let us dig.

             Parliament did NOT want to raise the age of consent as a whole. They made every effort to keep loopholes and laws that were not going to be effective. This was tremendously frustrating to the activists. Child labor and child prostitution were Lumped together, since prostitution was legal. Interestingly, pedofiles enjoy the violence and pain they inflict on children. The sexual and physical abuse seem to go together back then and in the modern times as well. So the pimps and the factory workers both made tremendous profits exploiting the most vulnerable of society: orphans and poor people. One politician was interested in supporting the movement but if I recall correctly he was very weak and ineffectual after winning the election. I don't recall his name offhand however I will follow up later today or tonight with some links for you. I have a time line and loads of research. I will get over to you. Any help going through it is very useful. I am on mobile right now.

            Excellent research and there is much more we need to dig through on this. And sooner rather than later since much of the unsavory history is being scrapped so much on the evil net.

             It is. 4 years ago it was easy to even name the elite families who enriched themselves on the abuse of children. Today I cannot find the confirmation. 
One of the most effective protests of the purity movement: was when women descended on the capitol dressed in white carrying broomsticksxm, to clean out the dirty old men politicians, they demanded the right to keep their maidenhood(virginity) the age of consent laws were passed after that. This story is scrubbed off the internet. It is probably in a book but it was easily found before. Wikipedia entries of Josephine butler and William t stead were all recently edited by the way. August and September of 2017. :(

            I agree with you wholeheartedly. In fact the families that fought against the purity movement, are still in power today. There are portraits all over the smithsonian museum of these criminals as if they were heros. They sit on boards of pharma companies and banking, they are still involved in the "family business" the child labor went oversees. The de beers diamond mine uses children, India has sweatshops of children working. Yes they want to go back to the old days where they could anything they wanted out in the open. I think the pizzagate movement is a big threat to their agenda.

              That is why it took me a while to put aside enough time.  I wanted to read it all.  A little while in, I knew I had to wait.  It was worth every moment I spent reading.  There is so much in it to learn and remember.  Yes, that is the problem.  The remembering, they do not want us to remember or have available what horrids happened in the past. There is a reason for that.  Not repeating it.  THEY want to repeat it and we cannot let them.

               There are a lot of details that I could not find because they have been scrubbed. However what cannot be denied, are the handwritten witness testimonies, the victim testimonies, their photographs, even then it was not enough. its time to start documenting everything we can.

                Documentation before total Erasure.  They are working on changing our textbooks to erase the past.  They are going to do this in Europe as well.  The night before Macron was elected, they released some of his hacked emails on 4chan.  In those emails his plan is to change the histories of the countries and to appease the Refugees by bowing to theirs.  This is also how they will kill Christianity.  They are on a roll and we must stop them at every turn.

             Thank you for reading it, I know it was long. 
I am so glad it gave you hope, that was the whole intention of putting it together. Faith/hope is important, if we know we will will win the movement presses on despite the set backs. Faith can move mountains I have heard :)

            Charles Dickens also campaigned for children's rights, education and other social reforms. His novel Oliver Twist for example, even if described as fictional, it was telling about real issues of its time. Perhaps someone here should do the same and write a book.

             Exactly!!! we don't only need researchers we need writers and artists, and musicians. He was one of the heros of the movement. Oliver Twist was based on a real interview of a little boy who suffered terrible abuse  and poverty. 
Notice the majority of mainstream charities only ask for donations. During the purity movement anyone could contribute in their own unique way.

              Yes, they ask only for money for the do not want us to see the inner workings,  I bet they do not have volunteer programs in the hospitals involved in organ harvesting.  Do Gooders are  the last ones they want messing up their operations.

               Of course they do not want volunteers, just money which goes into an offshore account. Volunteering is a great way to plant spies don't you think? That's what they do, they infiltrate and spy and break up the organization from the inside out.

                Yes and Yes.  I totally agree.  We must start trying to set up cameras, etc.  This is what they do and we are a larger army.

            This is great stuff, upvoated.

            I've believed from the start that this is going to be a generational struggle, something that takes decades. A few months ago, I used the analogy of the 30-year struggle by the people of Sicily to get rid of the Mafia. They would do things like post stickers on storefronts, to let people know that a particular restaurant or deli no longer paid the "pizzo," or extortion money. (
            <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2017/08/04/europe/sicilians-mafia-pizzo/index.html">
             see here
            </a>
            ).
           </p>
           <p>
            I still think the anti-Mafia crusade makes a good analogy, but your historical work is even better.

             I read that post and it was excellent. I agree that this is very similar to organized crime. In fact, I will take it a step further, I believe that the whole system: political, health care, judicial, law enforcement, child protection services, non profits, banking, drug cartels, mafia.....it is all a well- coordinated, organized crime effort. I think if you look at the low and mid level arrests that have been occurring it follows the pattern of how organized crime bosses are taken down. This movement is just getting started. I am convinced that history repeats itself and based on history our team wins!

            What is really exciting is we have tools they did not have. Information technology, social media, home office printers, cell phones, we already have laws on the books that simply need to be enforced. Pedos better run, the pizzagate movement is just getting started!!!

            I will soon posts the techniques the purity movement activists used to get around those same issues. In fact the Victorian era was even worse since law enforcement were often the pimps of the brothels. It will not change overnight but if they could do it, we can do it.

            Forgetmenot --
Thank you for educating us to this past history.  Sadly, today, the right wing would very happily reinstitute child labor - !!
And looking forward to your future posts on this subject.
Oppression brings opportunities for enslavement and criminal acts and we saw that also on this land with the Native American children who were so brutally abused in every way possible in US "Church" schools run by RCC and Mormon Church.
Conditions of Slavery where Africans were held here also obviously were total control over another human being with any behavior possible.
The thinking behind this kind of exploitation of children is something we all need to fear.
And to avoid it, we need to act in defense of children.

             Yes you are right about that. The satanic mills were operated by these corporations. Queen Victoria's husband called these children part of his production capacity. 
The sexual exploitation and trafficking was labeled as "white slavery." In fact animals were treated more humanely and afforded more protection than children.
            </p>
            <p>
             These activists paved the way for the suffragettes and the abolitionists. In fact, one of their strategies was to partner with likeminded groups. They even enlisted the help of labor unions.
            </p>
            <p>
             Child labor was the Norths answer to cheap labor, which is interesting that the sexual exploitation of children goes hand in hand with child slavery and abuse.  Is this why they are so desperate to traffick undocumented persons across the border? Cheap labor? Hmmm. 
The old elite families such as rockerfeller and Vanderbilt enriched themselves off of child labor. It is disgusting to see their portraits hanging in the smithsonian,  They committed crimes against hummanity. Thank you for your kind words.

              Really think you have done brilliant work here in showing us that history is repeating -- that this sexual abuse of children is something the world has seen and conquered before.
Amazing how many neglected to get into that history!

              I have been very active for some time on 3 other online sites. Some posters are very amenable to reading and responding to easily understood threads that follow a clear format. For example the shock value of the Royal Family eating people resonated. Prior to this point many associated cannibalism with savage tribesmen. Some suggested there are those in Europe who continue the practice. An update would be quickly read my numerous posters.
             </p>
             <p>
              On a 2nd thread some were asking for details after I hinted about the extent of pedogate and child-trafficking in Haiti. However those who are already stressed by college, work, paying bills, etc do not always want to hear about more bad news they are powerless to solve.
             </p>
             <p>
              There was more positive response to a discussion I started on what really happened in Jonestown. Yes everything directly relates to all of our discussions on this forum. The well acted and edited dramatic TV movie was completely sanitized of the financial, physical and sexual abuse of the very poor children dragged into the cult. You would not believe the details of what I uncovered. Again it directly relates to abuse in cults today.
             </p>
             <p>
              A 3rd site I'm on was aggressively pro-Hillary. While I understand and even agree with many of the Libertarian social themes of Marriage Equality, and the plight of those who disagree with their family's controlling, ultra-Conservative, religious sanctioned demands, I cannot believe most do not want to hear anything remotely negative about Hillary, her actions re pedogate, or the Democratic Party.
             </p>
             <p>
              Even hinting that something is amiss would label me an immediate loon and conspiracy theorist. That included an attempt to label Soros as widely disliked by people in many different countries for his economic policies.
             </p>
             <p>
              So the above IMHO summarizes the public's response to Voat's and other's efforts. In reality a few hard working, brave souls have always accomplished change for the rest of the population who benefit.
             </p>
             <p>
              There is another factor hurting the expose of pedogate. In some cultures parents prefer their daughters after puberty to be matched with a slightly older man. I would say there would be a maximum of 8 - 10 years difference.
             </p>
             <p>
              Growing up in a small town I saw my classmates starting at age 14 being matched up with men who were financially established and had experienced more of life. Now of course the parents had to approve the man before any real courtship began. A lot was expected of males. That's why they tended to be a little older then the virginal brides they desired. It definitely wasn't a "pump and dump" situation either or the girls' parents would seriously retaliate. Break-ups were treated like a divorce.
             </p>
             <p>
              I wish to stress the teenage girl had a lot to say in her choice as long as he was of the appropriate religion, had similar cultural and moral values, and wan't taking their relationship casually at all. That's why it's essentially different from pedophilia in that the man although a little older is supposed to pursue only one younger woman, and the goal must be marriage rather than "fun and games."  Still such dating practices are viewed as illegal and immoral in many parts of the USA.

               The more information out there about Elites/Wealthy, I think the easier it is to see that the right wing is the cause of all of our stress at every level.  Eventually they are coming for all of us in one way or another.
These are psychopaths seeking total Mind Control over the masses.

               Jonestown -- recall reading Mae Brussel's writing on that and that she thought very clearly CIA involvement/
experiment.  Will watch for your future posts.
              </p>
              <p>
               Also join you in confusion about Hillary ... Seems clear to me that both Hill/Bill have been closely connected to CIA since at least Mena, Ark and drug running/Iran-Contra. 
And I also wonder if the connections to CIA weren't made much earlier -- perhaps as youths?
              </p>
              <p>
               Amazingly, there are still those who believe in a "Conspiracy-free America" while all evidence 
is to the contrary!
              </p>
              <p>
               <strong>

               </strong>
               Agree.
              </p>
              <p>
               As for other "cultures" ... sadly too many of them are based in religious or male-supremacist beliefs.
And the reality that it is more difficult for women to be fully self-supporting and independent -- and still
often must rely on marriage for income.  Keep in mind that in the US even through much of the early 70's,
and beyond ... women here made only 50% of what males made for the same work.  Gradually it's risen
to what I think is somewhere still below 75%.
But these "matches" aren't free will for the young girl -- and I'd say any sexual relationship between an older male and a 14 year old girl Is immoral.
              </p>
              <p>
               You know that here, any involvement with a girl of 14 would be considered a form of pedophilia.
              </p>
              <p>
               Again, these "cultures" are usually based in male-supremacist societies/religions.

               it is true, this information is not easy to face. In fact I was discussing it at a family gathering. Many had to get up and take a break because it was so disturbing. That is very understandable, I went through a crisis when I discovered this about a year and half ago. What we do takes a big heart and more courage than any of us knew we had. We need to be proud of ourselves.
I think a small group of fanatics or conspiracy theorists can change the world, the tactics we use will determine whether we succeed or not. Right now it is an every man for himself movement. It is largely research based and social media based. Many of us are not techies. Many of are not familiar with social media. The purity activists used strategies that are applicable even today. I plan to share that very soon. I am putting the finishing touches today and tomorrow. 
It sounds like you are on a forum that is loyal to Hillary based on emotion, rather than facts. My suggestion is not to convince with facts. Emotionally based people are not influenced by facts. That's ok. They will react emotionally to the story of a abuse victim probably, that has no political connotations. The idea is to find common ground, victim stories are going to be very important to this cause. It will move hearts in a way that political biases will not. I will share more on this soon.
              </p>
              <p>
               Also I am curious, what religion was that? That arranged marriage for heir daughters? Incidentally I was in a cult as a child and yes you are right, there was terrible abuse of children. I look forward to reading what you uncovered. Did you post it here?
I don't think a teenage girl has much of a choice if she is given the choice of this old guy or the other. I think she is being forced to make a choice by people with power over her life. That does not seem fair. Especially because at 14 your personality is not formed, in fact you are physically still a child, being forced to make adult decisions by your own parents. What about college? Or a career? Or travel? These are all important parts of being a young adult and at 14 that choice is being passed from her parents to a man who will have financial control over her. While their daughter has no ability to get out should she want to. So as I continue to think about that, I have to ask you agree that a 14 year old daughter should be married off to a grown man who is financially independent?

            Where vulnerable, impoverished girls and women exist, there are always old, dirty, rich, entitled, white men to prey on them.  Interesting that Lewis Carroll took many of those photos.  Lewis Carroll wrote Alice through the Looking Glass.  He certainly had pedophilic tendencies, as he loved taking erotic photos of little girls.

             Yes. It is true. The reality is that the anti pedofile mind set is very new to our culture. During the Industrial Age it was normal and acceptable to be a pedofile. It was not illegial to rape a child Until 1861. It is hard to believe. Child Prostitution was legal and children were brutalized by factories and the judicial system. There were many pedofiles like Lewis Caroll. Especially among the wealthy class who felt entitled to the "fresh meat"

             God speed as well, this is only the a small part of the story. Their strategies were brilliant and applicable to pizzagate. I will post it soon.They did it without firing one shot. It is gods work, we were born to win this.

              YES.  I agree firing shots may injure innocents, maybe even children. That is not what God would advise.   I too believe in us.

               I used to think without a revolution nothing would change. Seeing the purity movement accomplish what they did peacefully and for such long lasting effects Convinced me that we can do this nonviolently and change the world in the process.

             I am thrilled to hear about breitbart exposing the satanic connections to the Washington elite. It feels like things are coming together, and lining up. With God on our side who can be against us? Pedos are nothing but worms, they are no match for the army of light!

            I like to say that trust is reserved for spouses and close family. Everyone else use due dilligence. It's common sense. Trust is for family.

            I no longer believe in coincidence, Bannon has an agenda. I agree about MSM. They are owned by the pedo elite and will do everything to silence and discredit this movement and our activists. This is a race against time. Luckily history is on our side. Everything that was hidden is coming to light.

            We need a new subverse, devoted solely to red pilling the masses  regarding pedogate/ pizzagate . We all should be doing something on a daily basis to somehow get the word out  to John Q Public.  There are plenty of ways to do that, from organizing pizzagate info rallies (Think of PizzagateHowie...why is he doing this all alone? We should be rallying in our towns too) to passing out flyers, to pinning  information on supermarket/church/work bulletin boards, to informing our pastors, and possibly withholding donations until they start speaking about it in church, to relentlessly  targeting media outlets and forcing "pizzagate/pedogate " into the  public eye. (example: wave pedogate signs in front of news cameras or on morning shows when they pan the audience... or at televised sporting events ) to writing on dollar bills, to tucking information into merchandise at retail stores ( put informative pizzagate links inside pockets of a new clothing, handbags, wallets, toolboxes,shoes, boots, books, BBQ grills…   you name it )  to handing out flyers at art fairs, farmers markets, music concerts, sporting events, etc...   There are many ways to get the word out. We have to organize and do it. Where there is a will, there is a way.
           </p>
           <p>
            If we had a subverse dedicated just to this topic, I think it would help to organize and motivate people to do something, other than post on Voat and tweet on Twitter.  Most  people I know do not tweet and do not visit Voat.  And, unfortunately, most people I know get their news from the worthless MSM.

             Our governments are packed with criminals busy trying to take us backwards.
Howard Zinn/The People's History of the US, often said that governments aren't changed from inside
but from outside movements.
Anyone who has tried to run for political office knows that the key is $$$$ -- and openings and success are limited if you don't have it.

            Well, of course, we need a long-range plan. The Cannibal Elite had one and look what happened? I tag a lot of my posts with a call to action. GET INVOLVED IN POLITICS! Yes, YOU! Run for the city council, or volunteer for campaigns. Run the local charity event, JA's crowd did and that pushed them into getting their slimy hands into the community. If you don't want to run, lobby your representatives. If they don't listen, start negatively commenting on social media. We need to get together to show numbers.
           </p>
           <p>
            This is NOT all right! Our kids need protecting, and since we're the adults, we have to get involved! Yes, arrests are lovely, and it might put some leaders in this group away, but there are hundreds, no thousands more. It's why we need laws on the book, strongly opposing changes, boycott movies/music/artcles/whatever that normalize pedophilia. Fight back when a member of PedoWood, whether it be a slimeball director, or loony tune actor/actress, and do not back down in your stance that this is unacceptable and so are they!

             Absolutely yes to your post! I would upvote you a thousand times if I could. I am not a bible thumper but there is a scripture that says "my people perish for lack of vision. " it's in proverbs. My next post will be the game plan that won the battle against the pedo elite. Many people have already grown weary, many have been harassed and intimidated into silence. Alex jones comes to mind for example.
            </p>
            <p>
             This is why it is important that we know the true history of this movement because I want the victory to repeat itself. This time instead of an age of consehow about a minimum sentence of life for a pedo. More to come soon. I am giving a little bit of time for the rest of the community to get up to speed because we need as many minds contributing ideas and organizing a plan and vision. Each of us has a way to contribute. 
It's a ton of information to sift through. 
Your passion is contagious thank you!!!

            England, while siding "nobly" with the Abolitionists against slavery, had their own dirty laundry in child enslavement.
           </p>
           <p>
            I wonder how many child crusaders in England suffered physical harm (assassination) from their campaign against child prostitution?
           </p>
           <p>
            There are some who say that Jane Hull, who went over to England in 1889 to learn about improving child/family welfare ,had a hidden agenda. Could it be that when enough light is shined on something dirty, that dirty takes on a shining face to deceive?

            To achieve success is needed a sense of outrage. How to foster that now a days? We've become indifferent, apathetic and self serving.  Go along to get along. I was reading the obituary of someone who died in Santa Fe, NM. This individual when a teenage Boy Scout, sexually abused younger boys to the point where the Boy Scouts of America had to pay damages. Yet the man in his community went onto work in the local government, retired with a pension and got a Christian burial: "admired and respected by many in the Santa Fe community"

             In the Victorian times there was zero outrage poor and unwanted children were the equivalent of animals and died on the street from hunger, sickness, and exposure. Our predecessors raised awareness in many different ways. The outrage built up little by little then it boiled over. 24 years of planning and work. This movement is only about a year old.
            </p>
            <p>
             We are building upon the work of our predecessors. I know that we have the victory. We were born for this. :)

              Note that AGAIN in the time of Princess Diana she was actually calling out Elites because
of the building poverty and condition of many British citizens.
It wasn't just about AIDS patients which attracted her concern.
Homelessness in UK was a very serious and building problem at that time.

                Citizens create economies but they are then manipulated by our banks and financial institutions for the

                It's the wealthy who create recessions and depressions which create new opportunities for wealth for them,
Including the take over of their "competitors."

               <p>
                And, often discussed here is the situation with wars creating new refugees and orphans.

               It still is.  It is currently estimated that third of U.K. Children are living in poverty, and this includes many from within working families.  The UK government is looking to completely destroy the welfare state and the effects of their cuts and legislation has been described as genocide of the poor, vulnerable and disabled.

                I'm only aware that in 90's was shocked to learn that there were homeless in their subway/Metro.
And sad to see you confirm the situation is still ongoing today.
This all begins with the rise of the right wing and its violence ...
and their ability to destroy programs by depriving them of funding.
Same thing happening here really since 11/22/63 coup in US.
And they very joyfully attack the most needy and vulnerable, always/disabled ...
here as well.
                <br/>
                And, though they LOVE perpetual war, they despise the soldier or helping that soldier
after they are wounded or victims of PTSD -- or with actual care and medications.
               </p>
               <p>
                This is not, of course, what the citizenry want -- that's understood.

             They utilized multiple strategies to raise awareness. It took more than 20 years. I can't wait to share that info. Because the tactics are so applicable to the pizzagate cause.

             It's because they depend on a system in which the dominant behavioural traits focus on survivial: i.e. social dominance, property, and sexual response. This description originates with the triune brain model, as applied to the will-to-power philosophy of the civil system in which humanism developed.

              Peace and evil are opposites; fighting for peace is like f*ing for virginity. Strictly speaking evil can't be defeated, but it can be avoided by understanding and applying the dynamics of peace.

               I am working very hard to defeat evil by exposing lies and spreading the truth. Evil can be defeated. I believe that with my whole being. The reason evil flourishes is that good men do nothing.

                There's nothing wrong with exposing lies and spreading the truth, and it's true that apathy enables evil to become prevalent.
               </p>
               <p>
                The modern world has little concept of the nature of evil because of science, which is ethically agnostic, and because of religion, which is based on belief rather than reality. The dimension of peace and evil is like the dimension of time in that both have a strong connection to consciousness. When you fix your attention on evil you unavoidably attract it to yourself, and to defeat something you should understand it, which of course involves giving it your attention. The solution then is to focus on peace, and in the context of evil this involves bringing those who embody evil to justice.

                 I agree with most of what you said generally. However there are times that good people have to push back against darkness, there is a happy and positive sense when acting with justice and in defense of little ones. But I understand what you mean. :)

            I posted only a fraction of the links. I wanted to give everyone a back ground first. There is so much more on the subject. Now that bannon is back running breitbart, we might have a chance to have a modern version of William t. Stead.

             Excellent!  Thank you for all your research.  It's encouraging to consider the long game, we aren't at the beginning of it, perhaps half way?  If one considers the sources of research that have been ongoing for years already.  The key is connecting the right dots, putting them together in such a way for average person not knee deep in research to easily get the message.  Tie it to current events in ways they haven't considered to see the long term pattern of deception. Tell everyone, repeatedly.
            </p>
            <p>
             We don't have the MSM on our side, but now most people don't trust them and are well aware of how deep their lies go.  That opens up the field for truth to see the light of day.  When I have a chance I'll post the info that I have on the topic of age of consent (you may have them already).

              Oh I think we are still very early stages. It's only been about a year. Our community is very fragmented just the other day I witnessed one of our top researchers label a supporter and colaborator : demonic because the supporter believes in aliens. Immediately many of their followers became divided. We are still suceptible to divide and conquer. Which is the cabals favorite tactic. Max spiers was a ufologist who helped who was an early activist who spread awareness of michal Aquino and pizzagate. We cannot afford to attack each other.
             </p>
             <p>
              You don't change the society in a year. Let's see: victim testimony needs to compiled and documented, we need experts to publish journal articles, we need to present legislation, amendments, memes, poems, songs, and collaboration with other organizations. Petitions, branding, slogans, that is just a sample of what the purity movement activists did. Unlike the Red Cross there is way more to contribute besides donations :)
             </p>
             <p>
              There is so much more to share. I can't wait to post it.

               People like Sibel Edmonds have been working on this for more than a decade, but you're probably right that there will not be a fast resolution. But your post gave me hope that there could be a chance for change!

                Just like Sibel  Edmonds, Charles dickens was one of the first who was trying to spread awareness. He worked at least a decade before the movement made even minimal impact. Before it was even known as a purity movement. His work had far reaching results. I suspect it will be the same with sibel Edmonds.

               I disagree, I believe we have at least 40 years of hindsight (more if you include research such as your own), and at minimum 10 years of concerted effort of a lot of people working on research.  We are exposing what was buried and making connections in ways that presents a larger picture that is greater than the individual stories.  People don't like being manipulated to the degree that they have been manipulated, they are open to hearing the truth when presented with an overwhelming amount of proven cases that interconnect.
              </p>
              <p>
               What the average person won't listen to is ETI accounts, they will tune out.  They also will reject proselytizing.  If one's focus is on awareness of systemic/institutionalized child abuse and predation, what is proven already is enough for the average person.  They just need to have access to that information about what is proven (but has been ignored).

                 Sorry, I disagree that we are only in the early stages, i.e. 'only a year', because PG is not the beginning of the story, and I don't think that it would take 25 years to change anything (at any rate we don't have 25 years).
                </p>
                <p>
                 We can accelerate the dynamic for change based on two huge advantages that the purity activists movement did not have:
                </p>
                <ul>
                 <li>
                  A library of existing facts, history, research already done on the subject and access to so much of it
                 </li>
                 <li>
                  The information age: information gathering and spreading at unprecedented speed and the tools for organizing the information at unprecedented speed.
                 </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                 The disadvantages we face:  Information fatigue, information overload happening to the average person, as well as decades of psyops, conditioning people to not respond or care.

                  Pizzagate is an actual movement. With identifiable leaders and specific facts and activists trying to raise awareness around that issue. What movement is over 40 years old? Franklin credit union was one scandal that unfortunately failed: The presidio day care also unfortunately failed as well. Especially because the movement resulted in the false memory syndrome. 
Of course there have been activists through out history sounding the alarm about this issue. However as an organized movement the purity movement:

                  1.forced the hand of legislators 
2. resulted in the prosecution and arrest of abusers.
3. Created organization to assist and rehab victims. 
4. Used slogans and branding. 
5. Raised global awareness.

                  I am not familiar with any movement in the past 40 years that is similar to pizzagate as far as the mainstream attention it has received so far. But I could be wrong. Please share. 
I am aware of individual activists who have worked tirelessly and at a tremendous personal cost to raise awareness, it never hit mainstream society though, that I know of.

                  who and what are you referring to?

                 <p>
                  I look forward to hearing your input it will be important in the next stages, ideas on how to contribute, unify and organize to take this to the next level. Each of us have something unique to offer.

                  first we all need to understand the purity movement, because they left a successful blueprint for overcoming the difficulties of fighting pedofiles who run the government.

                  Will it take more than 20 years?  I hope not! Understand the purity movement forever changed society. The idea of a childhood did not exist before the 1800's. The idea that a child is entitled to an education, play time, affection, and basic needs was revolutionary. Changes like that don't happen overnight. However I agree we have the Information Age, we have printers, computers cell phones, we have laws already written that simply need to be enforced. So maybe we can hit the ground running and pool our resources and build upon what has been accomplished already. 
I think the odds are in our favor, dr Phil says the best indication for future behaviour is the past. So I like our odds. We are NOT going to give up.

                   I know the feeling...I have mounds of links and freaky rabbit holes I'm still looking into.  In the meantime, we'll rely on you to formulate your strategy based on the purity movement.
