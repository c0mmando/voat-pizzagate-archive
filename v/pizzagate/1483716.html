            "A bartender at Comet, who said he didn't see a gun himself, told News4 everyone inside started to panic as the man walked to the back of the restaurant. Customers and employees evacuated."
           </p>
           <p>
            D.C. police spokeswoman Aquita Brown said they detained a 28-year-old man from Salisbury, North Carolina, the Associated Press reported.
           </p>
           <p>
            "The incident has not been linked to terrorism or to recent threats to the business, which started when an online conspiracy theory started circulating, police said."

           <pre><code>States that comet ping pong conspiracy not involved

Ah so no mention of a gun again

Now hes 28 years old

Again a statement with a name from an actual police official

             yes, and he had no arms with him in the arrest photo. They talk, of getting guns from the car. I am sure there will be no footage of that, and we are to take their word for it. The yellow tape was already up, when he was arrested, which makes no sense. One report says, that police were cowering behind cars. I think that is from the Benjamin Freed article, that came out, before the event had even happened! ....So they are cowering behind cars, yet they have time to put up yellow tape everywhere?  They have guns aimed at him, and the whole street shut of, for nothing, but show.

            so apperently "thousands" are coming out in support of comet. there is only one, or two people, actually quoted. Still, meanwhile, not one parent or person who knows any of the children in those Alefantis photos, has said anything. Who knows. if those children are still alive even...
