            As always, thanks for a good post.  Im sure I am not alone in failing to read the IG report so its good to receive tidbits from it.  This  confirms that there were hundreds of thousands of Hillary emails; I had worried that we were dealing with rumor. And what a troublesome problem this presents whether blackhats or whitehats are in physical possession of the laptop. We have a situation here whereby a search warrant to obtain evidence against Criminal #1  results in the unexpected recovery of evidence of a different crime committed by Criminal #2.  Can it be used? We also have an issue of whether the evidence against Criminal #2  can be used when  Criminal #1 and his attorney voluntarily turns over all of the evidence without the consent of Criminal #2.  It will be interesting to see how this plays out.
           </p>
           <p>
            In the meantime  , lets hope that the evidence is in a safe and secure  place in NYC now that Criminal #1 is serving his sentence. If McCabe had said, Boys, send the laptop down to DC Headquarters,  the evidence may have disappeared.
           </p>
           <p>
            Im not as confident as

Fisagate is going to  take priority and I think that will be forthcoming  before the midterm elections which is just as well.

            <p>
             Many of Huma's emails.  Some HRC emails.  The IG report makes it clear how many they looked at.
            </p>
            <blockquote>
             <p>
              Utilizing various searches targeting Clinton’s emails, the FBI reviewed in full “approximately 48,982” items on the Weiner laptop. ,,,,,, The FBI reviewed 6,827 emails that were either to or from Clinton and assessed 3,077 of those emails to be “potentially work-related.” The FBI analysis of the review noted that “[b]ecause metadata was largely absent, the emails could not be completely, automatically de-duplicated or evaluated against prior emails recovered during the investigation” and therefore the FBI could not determine how many of the potentially work-related emails were duplicative of emails previously obtained in the Midyear investigation.
             </p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>
             So they start with 49K "items" and end up reviewing 6,800 emails of which 3,100 were potentially government records.  I don't know how they distinguish items from emails, but they use both terms.  Their warrant would not apply emails before or after she was Secretary of State, so those could be eliminated as could the 3,700 personal emails from her time at state.  She was allowed to delete these.   I'm guessing that many of the other thousands of emails were emails they are already seen, duplicates of emails from the earlier investigation.

             Actually, we only have one criminal involved in this and we don't have to wait to see how it plays out.  It played out already.  Weiner plead guilty and there's no other case.  To your question, the FBI had to get a second warrant to review the Clinton emails, this was a major part of the IG report.

            <p>
             Nope.   There's no other crime involved.  You're holding on to a hoax.  The story that the NYPD had the laptop and discovered all sorts of stuff before the FBI took the case and the laptop away was a hoax.  We know the NYPD did not seize the laptop.  It was seized by the FBI under a federal warrant.

             Do you understand what this talking point is about?   It's an attempt to convince people that hoax stories from 2016 might still be true.  The TruePundit hoax story claimed the NYPD would go public with the evidence if James Comey didn't charge Clinton (not his job at all by the way).  Guess what She was not charged and the NYPD didn't do anything.  Why?  It was a hoax.  Then Q claimed last November she was about to get got.  Again NOPE.  Didn't happen.  Didn't happen to Podesta or Huma either.   It's been two years....they had to make up a reason to convince people to hold on to the hoax and they came up with this goofy nonsense.   Do you really think if Trump and Sessions had the goods, they wouldn't LOCK HER UP?  After Trump guy after Trump guy pleads guilty?  Do you really think they would still be doing nothing? It's a hoax.

             I think it will be a case of
             <em>
              veritas in uno
             </em>
             , the opposite of
             <em>
              falsus in uno
             </em>
             .  Right now, the collective "personal truth" of the Left, and by default sheeple, is that ALL claims of pedo are not only fake, but the Right is guilty of pedophilia-related crimes.  We all know the Left are the masters of projection, but even projection will not stand up to the truth.
            </p>
            <p>
             While I think the worst of the worst information (Frazzledrip) won't leak out.  It will be up to the public conscience to intuit the truth from what becomes known.
            </p>
            <p>
             My prediction is that one piece of information will be proven true.  In this case, HRC emails commingled with child porn - that's all that's needed to reverse the CPP/Pizzagate "conventional wisdom".  While the looniest of the Left will deny, many, many more people will start to ask themselves - "wait, I thought the whole Pizzagate thing - child sex trafficking out of the pizza place - was fake?  Why are HRC emails mixed in with an investigation into child sex crime(s)?"  The cognitive dissonance will be at 10 in their heads.
            </p>
            <p>
             I could be wrong, but I believe this evil is too big to contain.  And like dominoes, once that first once topples, i.e. the first "proven" truth by the government, will tip all of the other allegations from "FAKE" to "PLAUSIBLE" at a minimum - Pizzagate, Las Vegas/Paddock, CPP/Welch, NXIVM (which is already proven true), etc.
            </p>
            <p>
             Lastly, I think FISA could have an unintended effect as well.  "If these people were capable of treason, why would it be impossible for the child sex crime(s) to be true?"
            </p>
            <p>
             I think we are about to find out.

              There is no question that the laptop is the key. That the cpp ppl acted like they did right after the story broke also points the finger at their guilt. I still think that hospitals/doctors/nurses/np's know exactly what is going on, but are afraid to go public. I might have been skeptical myself in Nov 2016 when the laptop came into discussion, except for a doctor friend who told us the trafficking is huge problem and it is sincerely world wide. I might mention that the died in wool Democrat changed his tune after he found out the truth. And he went to Yale. So, are the medical ppl afraid of 187?

               I think in the case of the area surrounding CPP, many, many are compromised and/or pedos.  The hospital where Seth Rich died; the 5000 block of Conn Ave NW and all of the surrounding areas; lawyers; NGOs.  Pedo central.

               The laptop contained the "insurance files", which likely contained video akin to "Frazzledrip".  Erik Prince and the NYPD knew the secrets of Weiner's laptop.  Prince is tied at the hip to the White Hats. They have it all.  And I suspect that the laptop is probably all that is needed to convict.  The White Hats used all-source surveillance methods to collect probably 100,000X more than the laptop, but using that information to convict would real sources and methods.

                I know this right about the area. A few years ago a dear friend who worked in the area moved back to our hometown. My friend I respected but we are on opposite sides politically. However, living in DuPont area and not being able to handle the "climate of dysfunction," which I thought just meant alternate lifestyles, I realize after the laptop, it was the "climate of evil." Obviously he also knew he had to get out because he couldn't thrive there. Positive energy gets pulled down by 
Angry, mean, dysfunctional energy.  I am using euphemisms, but know exactly what I mean. Over the weekend I tried to watch an old movie with Clint Eastwood, " The Dead Pool." Couldn't watch it...it showed a movie/music video being made about Satan. Now that I know it's not play acting, it just completely turns my stomach. And I think the music video shows this evil person violating a child. Again, it made me I'll. What's weird to me, Blacksmith, is if these children who are hurt don't seem to matter to ppl...but if it was a pet, they would scream! I love animals, but don't children matter?!?

                 This is truly becoming a battle between good and evil.  I can't watch most TV.  I do, including the worst of the worst - American Horror Story.  I'm aware of the programming, the brainwashing, the legitimization of evil.
                </p>
                <p>
                 Being aware makes one resistant to programming.  You can't hypnotize a person who doesn't want to be hypnotized.

                 People have a soft spot for animals.  People always defend animals.  I'm not sure what happened to devalue human life, in comparison.  I wish I had the answer.

             They furry/plushy thing, not to mention "panda" themes, are meant to "soften" the pedo images of these creeps.  There was a big "plushie" ring in Bucks County, PA (shocker) a year or two ago who were busted for full pedo.  Disgusting.

              Well it was actually unspeakable bestiality and torture of puppies.  Now I realized that bestiality serves to normalize pedophilia as sex with animals is horrific.  Maybe I should not listen to Mr. Metokur as he serves the beast.

               re. missing US children..."Let us start with FBI statistics on missing children in the U.S., so that skeptics can prevent the sheer evil of these deeds from shutting their minds.  In 2015, 442,032 juveniles went missing;  of these, 42,032 were not found.
               <a href="https://www.fbi.gov/file-repository/2015-ncic-missing-person-and-unidentified-person-statistics.pdf/view">

               </a>
              </p>
              <p>
               By comparison, in the same year in Japan 17,971 children (the equivalent of 44,927 in the U.S. when adjusted for population difference) went missing, and close to 99% of these children were found.

              I hope so! Pizzagate brought me here two years ago. Pizzagate is where they got sloppy. They got arrogant, thought it's so easy now - we're in control of government and media.

            I feel like I/we have been neglected Pizzagate and freeing the children and stopping this evil.  I know it's impossible not to Pizzagate it into larger criminal empires.  Not to mention a much greater Pizzagate WW.

            We know the White Hats and good LE entities at all levels are doing everything possible to disrupt the lower to mid-level networks.  There are tons of empiric evidence to support the fact that pedo arrests are happening at an exponential rate.  The big arrests are coming soon.

              Look what crawled out from under it's rock.  It makes little more sense now in current Q context..  Old Huma Weiner did HRC a dirty.  I'm pretty sure it wasn't a simple auto-forwarder.

               Kavanaugh, I think he would be a terrible justice and I think he perjured himself about using stolen emails and his behavior.  I think he and his supporters are going to turn a lot Republican women off.
