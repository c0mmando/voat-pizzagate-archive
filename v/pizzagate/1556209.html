<p>The Unification Church of Reverend Sun Myung Moon had close connections to Korean Central Intelligence Agency since its creation by the CIA. Four of Moon\'s early leaders were army officers with KCIA credentials and Moon\'s most influential aide, Bo Hi Pak, was liaison between CIA and KCIA, making numerous trips to the NSA at Fort Meade, Maryland. Moon\'s church is fabulously rich and influential, with at least 600 front groups. It purchased the Washington Times newspaper for over a billion dollars.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The military and CIA copied the Nazi methodology and began numerous programs of their own. The first CIA program was known as MKULTRA, the MK is an abbreviation for the German words for mind control. According to MKULTRA documents and sources, the methodology of mind control works best when severe trauma is administered by the age of three years old. Severe trauma, such as rape, applied at the age of three will cause the personality to split or dissociate in an attempt to shield the mind from memories of events too
painful to endure. The psychiatric term is dissociative identity disorder (DID) and can be produced accidentally or purposefully. The Three Faces of Eve is the story of multiple personality disorder, MPD or (DID) that had been created by childhood abuse. MPD can be created by a therapist in an effort manipulate the human mind. Psychic trauma and creation of multiple personalities may be caused by the ritual sacrifice of animals and humans, trauma causes the dissociation. The programmer will use triggers and hypnosis to call forth the created
personality, known as an alter personality. Trauma at an early age makes people vulnerable to dissociation, and thus easily hypnotizable. This process has been codified and applied to children outside the laboratory environment in a systematic manner. Typically the programmer might wear a rabbit suit and sacrifice a rabbit in front of the child victims. The image of the rabbit, a phrase from Alice in Wonderland, or similar paired images are used as the triggers to call forth the alter personality. The method works best when the trauma is repeated around six years of age. A few years later the child victims IQ test and personality tests are evaluated to determine whether the child may be trained in assassination, sexual blackmail, drug courier, or other role. Years later, the subject may be hypnotized and used for espionage operations but would only be consciously aware of the sense of lost time.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Monarch Hits The Streets: After public scrutiny of the CIA in the 1970’s the programs went dark, were moved out of the lab and into government created cults and main stream organizations that functioned as closed systems. These closed systems were run by CIA and military cutouts, people without direct ties to the government so the government could use the strategy of plausible deniability if these programs were ever exposed</p>

<p>With the recent excellent post on the Moonies cult (Unification Church) - <a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1555511">https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1555511</a> -  previously owning the building Alefantis freaked out about and broke cover to allegedly threaten a PizzaGate researcher - it made me think of all the links which we are building:</p>
<ol>
<li>CIA or other alphabet agency paedophile honeytraps for political compromisation / blackmail</li>
<li>MSM covering up the massive Gov / Elite inks to paedophilia and trafficking</li>
<li>Project Monarch / MKULTRA - mind control techniques (think: Lady Gaga, Miley Cyrus, Katy Perry etc - all the Pizza / Illuminati / satanic references in their videos, costumes, and music - now google their names with Monarch MKULTRA. Each one has MANY articles)</li>
<li>Consider how those said celebs suspected of Monarch mind control / using pizza sexualisation imagery, were so totally in the tank for Hillary and went out of their way to try to shill for her</li>
<li>The amount of cults coming up in these investigations, from the Shriners, Thelema, The Finders, and now the Moonies</li>
<li>How CIA has often been linked to be using cults as fronts for various illicit purposes, not least of which as massive testing laboratories for mind control / brainwashing techniques</li>
<li>how cults have often been fronts for child trafficking. </li>
</ol>
<p>For background, Monarch came out of MKULTRA, which in turn developed from Operation Paperclip, where the CIA brought in Nazi scientists and psychologists post-WW2, and continued their sick experiments in secret until it was declassified</p>
<p>Now here\'s a book worth reading - free on the net (pro tip: search any book on Google using &quot;filetype:pdf&quot; after the search term, chances are you find the book free)</p>

            Also it isn't uncommon for singers to talk about their alters. Beyonce calls hers Sasha Fierce, she is unstoppable and nothing like Beyonce she is the diva within etc. I forgot the names of Nicki Minaj's but hers is a male name and she talked of him as if she kind of feared his behavior and how he may react if you insult him. Not sure if it's an alter personality or a spirit they choose to invoke. Years ago I remember reading about calling on spirits for certain talents which sounds much like selling your soul.

            Do you only think pizzagate is only about pedophiles?  The elite want to attribute everything to pedofiles,  are you paid by them?

            I just read this article about George Bush senior and Operation Brownstone and Brownstar.
            <a href="https://underthegrayline.wordpress.com/tag/operation-brownstone/">

            This part Surprised me because it talks about Ted Gunderson. As most of you probably know, he was a whistle blower and revealed a lot about the mind control and torture these people went thru. This article says he's an awful person...
           </p>
           <p>
            CIA blackmailer Ted Gunderson, a known thief, liar and killer — a true “Daddy Bush FBI Troll, who surfaced in the 1990s to run cover for Bush and to identify those children who still may be living, who could be a liability to Bush, Gunderson and CIA George Pender’s Congressional Child Sex Blackmail Operation known as “Brownstar”.

               Ted was murdered for all the things he let out to the public and his relentless pursuing of new leads and justice. He is the voice interviewing many of the Franklin victims in their statements. There is someone on here who tried hard to discredit a number of things I mentioned a while back regarding Ted Gunderson. This man died for the cause and stood up for the victims. Yes, he was an FBI agent previously and worked at the White House but he was "awake" and spoke the truth long before any of us knew what was going on because he saw it first hand and wanted out, he then worked as a PI for himself. Don't let people smear his good work. Peace.

                I remember watching him a few years ago and I thought he was great. Him and another one. I'm trying to remember his name but he ended up being tortured. I thought Ted Gunderson was murdered too but someone, or an article, said he had cancer

             This seems like a pretty good article, but I don't know that source is supposed to be for this, especially naming Gunderson. I think other parts of the story were reported elsewhere, including in mainstream press about "midnight-tours of the White House".

             I am not an expert on this, but if you look at the people saying negative things about Ted Gunderson and the people that defend him, I have found his defenders to be more credible, but that's a poor argument probably. I will have to read this, thanks for sharing.

            Thanks for all the research. I've noticed a lot of soft disclosure of MKultra in the media lately. Stranger Things especially. Vigilentcitizen.com has a lot of really good articles on this and all the rest of their debauchery.

            Another aspect to this is mindset.  How do you condition a group of people to do this to children?  Well, it's simple - commodity dehumanization.  The mindset that children = people = herd.  It's conservation management.  If you believe the earth is overpopulated, then something must be done.  Just like managed game reserves, your 50,000.00 tag to kill an elephant allows them to raise 5 more elephants.  It's the same with kids - "sure, I'm paying 5,000.00 (or whatever the number is) to wail away on a minority child, then kill them after, but look at all the good the money is doing!" (going to child rescue, adoption, feed the kids stuff)

            I know it's hard for us to wrap our minds around a concept like that, but I think it is the honest-to-God truth.

            I am also convinced that children services are instrumental in the abuse of children , why else would there be such overwhelming evidence to support they give children to these monsters. This woman was promoted to adoption supervisor????

            Now why would a member of the Rockefeller family and then-Vice President be interested in investigating the CIA and exposing them and MKUltra?

            YES! This is the pizzagate I thought was being investigated, but rarely, it seems, is. I think this is the heart of organized political pedophilia, sex slavery, and blackmail system. Throw in drug smuggling, cause it's part of the whole shebang, too.

            The CIA learned the dark arts from reluctant British Allies during WWII. They were very good students, but don't discount the masters just yet.

              I have to say I wish more people were onto this angle. Loosely summing up British Intelligence helped setup US Intelligence (OSS) along with some Wall St. Bankers, after they used their spies to get us into war and to convince us to adopt their methods. The "special relationship" between the two countries is I think more to do with this than ideology or cultural history.

               If you delve into the Tragedy and Hope stuff, you will find the NWO stems from Cecil Rhodes round table groups. The theory was that the British Empire was too unwieldy and it would be much better to control people than control countries. Don't forget the Empire was the Empire the sun never set on; the biggest in history. All that had a huge architecture. Imagine how much more profit and power if you could be the unseen hand not focus of enemies. After that they perfected the art of blackmail and corruption for control. They mastered the Great Game (of divide and conquer) by playing groups off against each other by fomenting resentment and false flags. Something we are seeing today.

            I didn't believe that anyone worshipped Satan, until Pizzagate.  Here is Mark Passio, a former Satanist, talking about trauma-based mind control of children in order to fragment the personality so that it is compartmentalised. He says it happens far more than we realise:

           </p>
           <p>
            Here is Mary Ann, a defector of the illuminati, being interviewed by Henry Makow, who states that tens of thousands of children are being sacrificed/killed every year, and that Satanists make up about 80 to 90 per cent of the US government and military.:

              If you're an order follower, you have stated that you've relinquished your decision making process to a false, external authority. That's against natural law, and therefore satanic by nature. All military are satanic, by definition.

                If you believe that, then you are under mind control. Plus, you are using circular reasoning with your argument. Third, you assumption that people cannot function without masters is exactly what your handlers want you to believe. If you value freedom, I emplore you to contemplate this—it took me years to understand and discover this Law of Nature.

            Thank you for this post. I think this is why pizzagate is so hard for many people to accept, mk ultra either sounds insane, or they are victims programmed to deny it. Big churches, little cults, government agencies are all using the same techniques, but it seems that the Satanism is the inner circle, powerwise.
           </p>
           <p>
            Edit, just to clarify, I think the Satanism is a tool for the inner circle, whether or not Satanism is true (I don't think it is) is irrelevent, Its a just another vehicle for manipulative ritual abuse, grounded in traditional lore/history to give the abusers credibility.

             Cathy O'Brien talked a little of that in her book Trance-Formation of America. How Ronald Reagan made Michael Aquino wear his Satanic get up to a party. She says Aquino was humiliated by this as his Satanic priest outfit was just a costume and most attending the party already knew this.

             I'm thinking that real mind control is just a fancy way of saying demonic possession.
I believe in God, and I doubt God would allow anyone to 'mind control' you.
That is why I believe all sorts of satanism seems to be related with this evil deviants. It seems, everything eventually ends up with a satanism link.
            </p>
            <p>
             So I'm thinking these, at the top, are humans that are in perfectly possession by demons. Look up 'perfectly possessed'. It's basicaly when the person willingly accepts the possesion, and willingly furthers the goal of the demon. The 'normal' possession is when they make a pact with the evil ones, but most of the time after that, they cannot deal with it (that is why these normal possession vitctims, sleep with lights on, are paranod they are watched, etc).
            </p>
            <p>
             My take is, the sign of the beast, that the bible says, is demonic possesion. And all these MK Ultra evil shit, are experiments done by satanists in collaborattion with demons, to determine how to perfectly posses a human.
            </p>
            <p>
             So from their demonic perspective, it probably makes sense to use children.
They defile purity, that God loves.
And they increase their chances of perfect possession, since kids really don't know.
            </p>
            <p>
             I believe that mark of the beast, will be some sort of perfect demonic possession of most humans.
            </p>
            <p>
             So with media, movies, games, they are prepping humanity to accept it and embrace it.
So movies and games are nowadays used as ways to invite humans to dabble with witchcraft, incantantions, spells, etc.. all as a means to get humans to embrace it.
            </p>
            <p>
             We are dealing with sick fucks. Very evil.

              The CIA is just doing the work that the Church of Rome pioneered over centuries, and before them the Priesthood of the various Cults... Evil is a phenomenon on planet Earth borne or a collective Trauma about 10,000 years ago, when some major cataclysm occurred. See Michael Tsarion for more on that.

              The mind is not impenetrable nor is it ready to handle any level of abuse, especially while young. A lot of this has to do with fracturing the personality and mind through trauma. I don't see how this has anything to do with the idea of possession.
             </p>
             <p>
              There is a telling passage in Trance-Formation of America, where a foreign leader is tricked into thinking the US party has witchcraft abilities, but it is clearly just playing on their superstitions. Demons is a nice excuse for evil, but I don't see the evidence for them. I do see men doing evil, whether seeming possessed or not.

              Maybe another way to put it is that "mind control" is the way a atheist/materialist would define the results, whereas it would seem that they have control, they are so morally compromised that they only want what Satan wants.
             </p>
             <p>
              Fr. Amorth talks about this frequently, how a politician may not be technically possessed but affectively he is because he is so subjugated himself to evil that what would seem like acts of will are actually acts of demonic influence.
             </p>
             <p>
              Posession is still incredibly rare, but demonic obsession is increasingly common, or so the exorcists (what few remain) are now warning us.

               Possession is rare because it cannot be accomplished without free will.
              </p>
              <p>
               Obsession is more prevalent in society, because of the fact that people are dabling with things like witchcraft, spells, subliminal messages in movies music games, etc.. without really knowing what they're doing. It's really beyond their ken.
              </p>
              <p>
               And all these activities, attract the demons, who then try to 'whisper' (for lack of better word) to the person, to dwelve even more in these things, who ultimately lead to a pact with the demon.
              </p>
              <p>
               Maybe the satanists, the ones who know what they are doing, maybe they are trying to rupture the veil between our materialistic dimension and the spiritual field where these evil entities exist, so that these entities can enter into our world in greater numbers and spiritually attack us even more.
              </p>
              <p>
               In any case, it's all very evil I guess.

                ...This is why there is such a push for abortion, as in having people think of it as good, and baking into UN policies. Satanists use this grave sin in a ceremonial way with the purpose of allowing more demonic powers into the world. I don't know all the theology behind this, devout people I've talked to have stated this, but it does seem like it's working based on the unfathomable scope of these crimes and the exceptionally wicked nature of them.

             Yes. They use specific techniques in their abuse so that when recalled, the victims sound completely mad.  Eg they dress up in animal outfits, DOMINOS* masks, or do other bizarre things. Its to (a) screw with the person so they might believe (if they remember) that it was a bad dream or (b) nobody believes their bizarre recollections.  Look up gaslighting.

              Like telling a young child they are going to do something that children might normal complain about and it be code for the abuse. Then the child tells the parent uncle so and so for example, made me exercise and I hated it thinking they are telling. Most likely an unsuspecting parent would then tell that child, listen to uncle so and so because exercising is good for you.... 0_0 of course the panda code way is to drug them so they don't even remember and it's assumed they just took a nap and are groggy. I believe this is why drugs like ecstasy were originally invented and they also put them out on the street. It's hard to imagine these drugs are all invented and made by drug dealers.

            Just to add if you go through all this and everything else we have uncovered, I am leaning towards the possibility Alefantis is actually a CIA operative running some form of honeytrap.
           </p>
           <p>
            Maybe his role is to compromise politicians and other powerful figures by getting them involved in child abuse, trafficking, satanism etc. Then they are compromised and must agree to be assets of the CIA / New World Order elites, and further their agenda. With MAPs (handkerchiefs) as evidence (the squares of cloth under the child for mutual DNA evidence), video etc - nobody can risk upsetting the apple cart or they wil be burned.  Its a form of Mutually Assured Destruction. No wonder the entire political establishment, CIA,Globalist elites, Hollywood etc are going completely mad trying to stop Trump - he is a real risk as he is leading a counter-coup (see Steve Pieczenik videos) of people in the CIA FBI etc who want an end to this insanity.
           </p>
           <p>
            Here's another extract from the book cited in the OP
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             The Franklin Conspiracy refers to a sexual blackmail operation and savings and loan fraud that
began in Omaha, Nebraska in the early 1980's. Larry King, a 300 lb pedophile, operated a
national child prostitution network that catered to wealthy patrons and Republican Party insiders.
King was one of the fastest rising stars in the party, he sang the National Anthem at the
Republican convention in 1984 and 1988. King and his associates defrauded Franklin Savings of
$40 million dollars and used residents of Boy's Town and other children to video tape powerful
and influential men and women engaged in sex acts with minors. These blackmail operations
took place during fund raising parties for the RNC, those involved stayed late for the "after
party" that included drugs and sex with minors. (Franklin) The strategy of early MKULTRA
was to use sexual blackmail operations that targeted political figures in order to insure continued
funding from legislators. Victims who came forward testified that King and associates
performed Satanic rituals and human sacrifices. Many of the children who came forward with
their stories have since been murdered or imprisoned. The most prominent and vocal victim,
Alisha Owens, has been held in solitary confinement longer than any other person in Nebraska
history. King served 2 years for fraud and was promptly employed by his good friend, the editor
of an Omaha newspaper.

            - has many vids explaining how people are compromised by getting them involved in 'after parties', where young prostitutes are used (maybe mind controlled / trafficked). Once compromised, they are given advancement and or protection, the next time they then shag a 17 year old. Then a 14 year old. Finally they are so degraded and the lines so blurred they are now into fullblown child rape.  Maybe this is a form of increasing depravity as a stepping stone to protect themselves, or in return for advancement politically or financially....

            Then they are owned.

             I would like to add re Alefantis - I've thought he was CIA from beg too, but came at it from a different angle.  He considers himself first and foremost an artist really.   I think one of the things he did as an operative was produce the Heavy Breathing videos and "music" for the blackmail parties as psychotropic mind control products.  Heavy subliminal messaging and soulless psychotropic music combined with doses of LSD or other drugs served to control just about anyone, from a half hearted Congressman to a kid, to commit the acts needed for the cameras.  Amanada Kleinman called herself "Puppet" and was IMO handled by Alefantis.  The band was a front and could take the whole thing on the road to pedo 'house parties" which she comments on in her band blog - showing up to gigs that were literally a couple of people in a house.

              Thanks for the compliments. Yes I agree about the music. Some of the music vids had subliminal flashing images. They are playing with this for sure. The connections are too many. And the two movies Alefantis is linked to are also very very weird. There is hints of MKULTRA in both. The big thing I didn't/ couldn't mention was drugs, which feature heavily in MKUKTRA experiments. That also ties in with the polls instagram posts, #carisjames (carisprodol?) etc.

               The Heavy Breathing video I no luv also features a lot of drug taking as part of the story of dominating a pedo perv.  You might be aware of but I'll post a link anyway to "Acid Dreams" which talk about how the CIA became "obsessed" (book blurb) with using LSD and psychotropics since the 60s

             What a miserable life Alisha Owens has had. To be a victim and then end up in solitary confinement for years. Her whole life ruined. Yet, those sicko's have gone free. I wonder if scientists have somehow altered some people's DNA too. It's like they have no soul at all.

              Alisha Owens has been out of jail for quite some time now. She served about 4 yrs in prison and was quietly released. She had a baby girl during that time who was the police chief's. He is now deceased and denied it but apparently the child looks just like him. She lives a quiet life away from the public life. Sadly, when she was about to testify she found out that her brother had been murdered while in a jail holding cell on some minor charge. This was done to try to silence her. Many of the Franklin victims have been murdered or had family members murdered. I hope AO is living a good life and I wish the very best for her and her family. She's a hero and so are the other victims. May karma fall hard upon those who dealt so much anguish.

               Omg. What a tragic story! I wonder if she willingly had sex when she got pregnant or if she was being forced by him too! I guess it could end up being from one extreme to the other but my guess would be she would never want to be touched again after going thru hell like she did. I hope she's happy too and a good mother.

                Willingly had sex when she got pregnant??? Come on... She was just a teenager and he was the fucking CHIEF OF POLICE!!! He was a total piece of shit, manipulated her, conned her, followed her, he was a sick pedophile. She and the other Franklin victims went along with what was going on out of fear, etc., they were threatened and tormented by these sick fucks.

              On my many searches during pizzagate I've come across something a few times that I wouldn't be surprised about if someone told me it was related to all of this, and that is indeed gene mutation. If you think (very) big picture, a few things that the powers that be want from the 'regular folk' is for them to be compliant (for 'compliant' assume a lower than average level of intelligence), for our population to be manageable or even designable, and I'd maybe throw in things like purposefully introducing illnesses so that we keep buying medication and treatment. The FMR1 gene is linked to the first two of those; it's quite scary to think of the possibilities.

               That's so true. I'll read that. David Icke, I think, said he thinks chemtrails is altering our DNA. With the advancement in medicine and doctors giving patients so many prescriptions, you may be right. Even medication could be affecting DNA

               That was from the documentary Spin which is a must see. It made me afraid of Hillary winning when I saw it awhile ago.

               He probably became a targeted individual and received an extreme maddening form of harassment.  Just ask George Webb or David Seaman about it.  They're dealing with it right now.

              Did Brock get turned by Alefantis on behalf of the CIA / Clinton camp? Would be interesting to see the dyes of his "turn" and his split with Alefantis. Maybe he was made to create MMFA and CTR and turn them against the Reps. Maybe Alefantis has a vid of him raping young boys. I'm serious. Who changes their allegiances like this, with a weird breakdown in between?

              Yeah, I read about his change from conservative Anti-Clintoner to super pro Clinton. He was writing a book on them. It seemed weird but I did not hear about thinking people were after him. Thanks.

             Excellent.  I knew Alefantis was CIA from the beginning, but you and

             have done the work to prove it.  I would like to add that Alefantis is likely the product of a lifetime of systematic mind control that started at similar age of his current victims.  Blackmail is definitely a big part of this, but it's likely that many select victims are groomed to be used through their lives by the cult/ring/psyop.

              It's like uncle tom syndrome.  Likely the most responsive, most sociopathic, most "stable", obedient slave was groomed from among many to be a master.  Like, he escapes from his trauma through dedication.

             <p>
              Also, such leaders, though undocumented child slaves with false identities might sort of be the bastard children of elite families with "pedigree" or are the product of illicit ritual sex ceremonies like Hieros Gamos which produced the child between two elite people but who aren't publicly married.

              Yes. Who better to have as handler / honeytrapper - than a mind-controlled formerly abused asset? not like he will ever double cross. And MKULTRA has proven records where they can persuade people to suicide themselves with trigger words
             </p>
             <p>
              I fear we wil see Alefantis killed and blamed on us, or he will suicide - again they will blame us for pushing him over the edge. The closer to the truth we get, the more his handlers wil be looking at this option. No way they let him be taken in and plea bargain.
