<blockquote>
<p>Florida’s Fifteenth Judicial Circuit Chief Judge Krista Marx ruled against the Palm Beach Post in their bid to obtain the Epstein files from Palm Beach County State Attorney Dave Aronberg.</p>
<p>According to famed Miami Herald investigative reporter Julie K. Brown, during the hearing, the judge was “openly expressing contempt at the paper for suing” Aronberg and the Palm Beach County Clerk and Comptroller Sharon R. Bock.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="md-marx-insisted-that-only-the-court-not-aronberg-or-bock-can-release-the-epstein-grand-jury-records.">Marx “insisted that only the court,” not Aronberg or Bock, “can release the Epstein grand jury records.”</h2>
<p>Last month, the Palm Beach Post notified the public of their legal crusade to “unlock the secret” of why Epstein “was accused by police of sexually assaulting nearly two dozen girls at his Palm Beach mansion” but only “indicted on only a single charge of solicitation of prostitution.”</p>
<p>The outlet’s attorneys cast the continued legal shroud on Epstein–and his alleged ring of elite pedophile friends–as possibly the opposite of justice.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Access to the grand jury materials will allow the public to determine whether the grand jury process, and the secrecy that comes with it, was used to further justice or, instead, operated to shield Epstein and his co-conspirators from the consequences of their criminal activities” </p>
<p>&quot;The records would reveal why only one of Epstein’s young accusers was called to testify, what the 14-year-old was asked, whether her credibility was attacked and what other evidence was presented by then-State Attorney Barry Krischer’s top prosecutors.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Most importantly, it would help explain why grand jurors didn’t, as police recommended, charge Epstein with multiple child molestation crimes and instead indicted him for solicitation of prostitution, ignoring that the victim who testified was under the age of 16 and therefore couldn’t consent to having sex.&quot;</p>
<p>“No reasonable explanation has been provided as to why the numerous other known victims were not presented as witnesses and crime victims to the grand jury convened in July 2006,” the outlet’s attorneys continued.</p>
<p>“Nor has any reasonable explanation been provided as to why State Attorney Krischer, who was initially eager to investigate and prosecute Epstein for his crimes, over time lost the desire to do so.” </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Treasure Coast State Attorney Bruce Colton previously attempted to obtain those same records after being appointed by Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis (R) to assess whether Krischer and the sheriff’s office had been corrupted by Epstein’s powerful and well-paid legal team.</p>
<p>“Throughout its long history, secrecy has been an integral component of grand jury proceedings,” the same judge wrote in January when denying Colton’s bid.</p>
<p>But the paper’s attorneys argued that Epstein, who allegedly killed himself in a Manhattan prison last year, has no more need for or right to secrecy.</p>
<p>The paper’s apparently stalled out bid to unseal those records is distinct from an ongoing case in New York City where a federal judge there has been far more amenable to transparency viz. Esptein’s alleged co-conspirators.</p>
<p>In January, U.S. District Judge Loretta Preska ruled that certain documents with the names of non-party individuals in a previous case implicating Epstein and his crimes will be “unsealed on a rolling basis.” A somewhat limited ruling, Preska previously declined to release a more expansive set of documents related to that prior legal controversy and similarly rejected a call to unseal grand jury documents.</p>

              I'll pass on that. I know only what was in the US Sun article. I don't understand why Epstein's victims are prevented by the US Virgin Island court from suing co-conspirators. I thought the business of excluding co-conspirators was part of Epstein's original corrupt plea deal in the Florida criminal case.
