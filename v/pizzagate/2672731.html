            , not sure why you posted this thread twice, but I have to remove duplicates under Voat's spam rules. I will remove the second one with fewer upvotes.

            As much as I respect the Mods, there was a grave error made in October that must be amended. We are at a great loss because of it. (pizzagatemods)

             When mods ban someone , is it voted on by all the mods ? Or does one mod just decide on his own who he wants to ban ? I’m just curious if you happen to know ?

              If I remember correctly, and someone please correct me if I'm wrong, Milenial Falcon was the mod who banned her. When he was de-modded I remember her name being thrown around as being wrongfully banned by him.

                Oh so it wasn't Milenial Falcon. Did you notice the comment just below Mej from dom keyhote aka auralsects? It made me sick to read what he said to her. She didn't deserve that. No one deserves the nasty filth from that pile of garbage.

                 Correct. I was the one one who banned her, after trying repeatedly to get her to honor the submission rules, or stick to
                 <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/v/pizzagatewhatever">
                  v/pizzagatewhatever

                 . She thought they shouldn't apply to her; she didn't give me much choice. 😕

              I think she was banned from Pizzagate because she didn't follow the rules
             </p>
             <p>
              this was before Q posts were allowed on it

             <p>
              I had my share of posts deleted for not following rules

             <p>
              Elite, child abuse and or coverup
             </p>
             <p>
              all claims needed a link for post
             </p>
             <p>
              you would have to look up her posts

               Thanks I had my share too but what I meant was , does a mod have to get permission from all the other mods before he bans someone ?

                No Cc1914. Any mod can ban a user. Our policy is to give two warnings and try to help the person understand how to post their content within the submission rules. After the third post that ignores the rules, we ban. Users can immediately make a new alt, and if they respect the rules, that's fine with us. We are not at liberty to allow only certain users to ignore the rules. We typically let each other know if a user is approaching a ban.

             Unfortunately yes. Given the death threats he sent, Are We Sure is the most likely person who did it.

              Okay, some questions:
             </p>
             <p>
              1) How would
              <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/user/Are_we_sure">
               @Are_we_sure
              </a>
              have gotten her IP address?
              <br/>
              2) How would
              <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/user/Are_we_sure">
               @Are_we_sure
              </a>
              have found her name?
              <br/>
              3) How could
              <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/user/Are_we_sure">
               @Are_we_sure
              </a>
              have gotten any of Jen777's personal info without Voat itself being compromised, or complicit in her murder?
              <br/>
              4) Why are you not pinging
              <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/user/Are_we_sure">
               @Are_we_sure
              </a>
              on every post you mention his name?
              <br/>
              5) How would
              <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/user/Are_we_sure">
               @Are_we_sure
              </a>
              know you were finger-pointing at him if you're not pinging him?

              Please answer these questions. Extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence.
