<p>DC\'s Missing Teens: What\'s True and What\'s Not</p>
<p>After an inaccurate post went viral, here\'s what you need to know about the missing person cases in D.C.</p>
<p>By Erica Jones</p>
<p>An Instagram post claiming 14 girls had disappeared in D.C. over a 24-hour period went viral across social media Thursday. 
But that post is inaccurate. While the disappearance of any child is reason for concern, at no point in recent weeks have 14 girls disappeared from D.C. in a single day, police said Friday.</p>
<p>MAP: Locations Where Missing DC Teens Were Last Seen
Since March 19, D.C. police have shared 20 missing person fliers on Twitter; 10 of these people were juveniles. As of Friday, six of these juveniles had been found; four still were missing.</p>
<p>D.C. police have said there has been no increase in the number of missing persons in their jurisdiction. They\'re just sharing information in a new way.

&quot;We\'ve just been posting them on social media more often,&quot; Metropolitan Police Department spokeswoman Rachel Reid said.</p>
<p>Since implementing the tactic, Commander Chanel Dickerson, the new leader of the Youth and Family Services division, said the department has been able to close cases more quickly.

But the increased social media attention has caused concern in the D.C. area, especially since most of the teens on the missing-persons fliers were black or Latino. D.C. has long had a large minority population and is currently about 48 percent black.</p>
