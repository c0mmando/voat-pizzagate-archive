            I don't hear the full spectrum of crazy.  I do hear the voice of someone who has been through a traumatic experience, and is trying desperately to tell a painful and complicated story.

            Your reply is obviously sarcastic and IMO quite unfair.  What others are saying is don't jump to the conclusion that Emma is crazy just because of the way she recounts her story.  It's possible she seems emotional and agitated because she is remembering a terrible trauma she genuinely experienced.
           </p>
           <p>
            Also many people believe God is personally helping them.  I wouldn't rush to label those people schizophrenic.

            When you've been traumatised, I think this is how you sound--you come across as not centred, a bit all over the place, speaking too quickly, going off on tangents, not sticking to relevant facts, not able to lay out relevant facts succinctly.  But the fact that she's able to give so much detail about all surrounding events, to me, is proof of that she's telling the truth.
           </p>
           <p>
            She's suffered severe child abuse, and then is re-traumatised in an abusive relationship with 'Greg'.  I think she lives in survival mode, which is often the case with abuse victims.   I can totally understand why women stay in abuse relationships.  They are usually worn down by verbal and emotional abuse by the time the physical starts, at which point they are simply shells of their former selves, with no self-esteem, no self-confidence.
           </p>
           <p>
            Yes, when people bring God into it, they can sound a bit woo woo.  Unfortunately, it can turn people off.   But many people who've been subject to abuse find solace in God.
           </p>
           <p>
            I hope he gets charged and that the authorities come down hard on him.

            Still listening to this.  At 10.30 she mentions, Sony, Capitol Records (incidentally Katy Perry's label) and the Clinton Foundation as being part of the huge child pornography network she uncovered.

             I use to be borderline atheist 8 yrs or so ago.  It was when I fell into researching MK Ultra, which leads to pedophilia, which leads to Satanism, did I change my mind.  I thought to myself "there must be a God because there sure as hell is a satan".  Prayed in earnest to give me strength to continue researching it.  I was literally having panic attacks over the things I was finding out.  Anyone who really does research on this horror and not know that there is pure inhuman evil behind it, is blind.

            Actually it's exactly how someone sounds after they have been through a traumatic experience like that.  Even recounting it years later.

            She truly must be protected from above.  The Kim Clements thing really stood out to me because of his Trump prophecies starting around 10 yrs ago.  If you haven't heard them before they are really quite remarkable, which makes his prophecy to Emma remarkable also.
           </p>
           <p>
            Emma..if your reading here, check these out.  You have ties to Trump through Clements.  Sounds like you have a part to play in all of this.
