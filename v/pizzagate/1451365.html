Do not allow the MSM to turn this into a Trump-supporters conspiracy theory, since Trump\'s dumb quotes (I wouldn\'t be surprised if he did them on purpose to make his own movement look worse) paint every truther aligning with Trump look more idiotic. They know that people are leading a movement against the corporatocracy we now live in, so they have people like Alex jones and others pose as the leaders, with Trump being the political leader that is going to magically take down the NWO. They have these players in place so that they can make us all look crazy. It has worked, too. So, overall, keep an eye out for all possible players (don\'t have tunnel-vision for just Clinton\'s connections). I hope people can lead a nonpartisan movement, since then they will be unable to link us with idiots like Alex jones and co. They know they are in trouble. IF this is revealed to the world, then MUCH of the NWO could be taken down, since I\'ve heard that Pizzagate is just the tip of the iceberg. I hope the best for anyone doing research. If you agree or disagree with my remarks, please let me know, as I am interested in what other people think of what I believe is going on. I know Trump supporters will say I\'m wrong, and I would love to talk to them, too, even though I respectfully disagree with them on this matter. ANY OPINIONS?</p>',

            What I will say about what we're doing is this:  There are a ton of highly intelligent people working to expose Pizzagate from both sides of the political spectrum.  I was blown away when I saw the original reddit thread.  It was all A Grade hackers, and citizen journalists working together as a hive mind.  If you were able to read the comments carefully like I did, you could also tell that there were journalists pipping in from time to time, chiming in on how powerful this investigation was.
           </p>
           <p>
            What I will say about the mainstream media trying to paint the Pizzagate investigation in "Alt Right" colors is this:  They don't realize the social shift going on right now with the millennial generation.  They think of millenials in pejorative terms:   part time workers in the "gig economy", drug enthusiasts, slackers, and pseudo intellectuals.  To be fair there are a lot of millenials who fit that bill.  But then there are the "internet generation millenials", like myself and many millions of others.  We aren't fooled by historical lies.  We don't believe that Lee Harvey Oswald was able to kill the president of the United States from a library tower on his own.  We know that our economy is propped up by black market money from the drug trade, which is why the drug trade has been allowed to proliferate for so many years unabated.  We believe in UFOs.  We're not naive enough to believe that we are the only life in a Universe filled with hundreds of billions of galaxies that contain hundreds of billions of stars.  We don't believe in religion.  We know it is a myth designed to create social control structures and perpetual conflict.  The only question we ask is:  who wrote the religions?  We know that death isn't the end of consciousness, that matter can never die, and that our actions on this earth will affect the existence of our next iteration of consciousness on this earth, or another.
           </p>
           <p>
            That is the seismic consciousness shift that is going on with us right now, that the corporate controlled media will never get.

            People need to look no further than The Franklin Cover Up to realize that George H. W. Bush was exposed as being part of a nationwide pedophile ring long before the Clintons, James Alefantis', The Podestas and Pizzagate.

            Democrats and republicans are one and the same. I hope anyone associated with this child trafficking gets taken down, whether they're Democrat or Republican, politician or businessman, wealthy or some third-world citizen providing the children.
           </p>
           <p>
            There's enough people of all political backgrounds working on this now, I think that when others besides democrats are found to be involved, they'll be exposed too. Right now though, the biggest leads we have happen to be democrats, with the Clinton Foundation at the center of everything. That's the information we have, so that's what everyone is working with.

            The bilionaires that fund both parties are the real culprits. They push their agendas by exponentially out funding any one else with a voice. They are also known to change who they fund as long as they are willing to be patsy's. Been like that since the founders unfortunately. They just streamlined it with all these PACs.

            What's worse is that they can make it so that anybody that raises the issue of 'child slavery' or 'pedophilia' will immediately be called a nut, and lose his/her ISP, and be banned from internet.

            In 2006 Cass Sunstein ( Obama's Internet Czar ) issued a report on how to once and for all shut down the Conspiracy People, that action plan is now going into effect.

            IMHO Trump came to power by alt-right/conspiracy, they are no longer needed and are being thrown under the bus so that Trump has no opposition from the right, they can ignore the left; They can ignore all until the next re-election cycle, and then they'll throw out new bones for Alex Jones to throw to his dogs.

            Let's just hope that the MOD's quit deleting people's work, and quit defending the RNC pedo front's, the DNC+RNC all go to the same Luciferian Party's, Just like "Eyes Wide Shut", nobody at the door asks if you are DNC or RNC, they just ask if you know the password.

            IMHO the ppl who started pizzagate wanted it limited to DNC/CF/HILLARY&amp;Friends, its now gone all over the map, and this is a GOOD THING.
