<p>So....wtf does this mean??</p>
<p>I honestly have no idea. It could either mean that both Swann and Pizzagate.com owner were on the &quot;dark side&quot; the whole time, and the deleted message/tweet was a psyop by both parties, or -</p>
<p>Both accounts were hacked and no longer controlled by said individuals, or -</p>
<p>Ummm. I really don\'t know what else could explain this, but obviously these two things are related somehow. When these symbols appeared on both of these accounts, #the resistance wasn\'t a politically coined term yet, AFAIK.</p>

             Yeah, I think OP is reading the opposite into this than is intended, Afaik, that #resistance anti trump hashtag movement wasn't originated with Star Wars branding/association, just generic usage of the word "resistance", which has been a non Star Wars generic word for ages, and also, it makes no sense for Ben Swann to be a disinfo agent, when the only thing he's done so far is be the only main stream news reporter to talk on air about PGate in a fair, credible way and get fucked over for it.
