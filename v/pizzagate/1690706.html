             Yeah, I think OP is reading the opposite into this than is intended, Afaik, that #resistance anti trump hashtag movement wasn't originated with Star Wars branding/association, just generic usage of the word "resistance", which has been a non Star Wars generic word for ages, and also, it makes no sense for Ben Swann to be a disinfo agent, when the only thing he's done so far is be the only main stream news reporter to talk on air about PGate in a fair, credible way and get fucked over for it.
