<p>If special counsel Robert Mueller finds any crime outside the scope of the federal investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election, then he\'ll have to seek permission, Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein said Sunday.</p>
<p>&quot;Bob Mueller understands and I understand the specific scope of the investigation, and so no, it\'s not a fishing expedition,&quot; he told host Chris Wallace on &quot;Fox News Sunday.&quot;</p>
<p>Rosenstein appointed Mueller to oversee the federal Russia probe, which includes a search for possible collusion with the Trump campaign, back in May after President Trump fired FBI Director James Comey. Because Attorney General Jeff Sessions recused himself from the case, Rosenstein ultimately was given the power to hire, and fire if he has good reason, Mueller.</p>
<p>It has been reported that Mueller\'s investigation has expanded to look at the finances of Trump and his associates, giving rise to concerns that Mueller could make it the focus of the probe. Rosenstein seemed to dismiss this issue.</p>
<p>Asked if there were no red lines under the terms of his order, Rosenstein said that the investigation is subject to the rules and regulations of the Justice Department.</p>
<p>If there\'s evidence of a crime that\'s found within the scope of what they have agreed, then Mueller has free rein, Rosenstein explained. If it\'s outside the scope of the probe, then &quot;he needs to come to the acting attorney general, at this time me, for permission to expand his investigation,&quot; he added. Rosenstein noted this as a precedent, which was also followed by independent counsel Ken Starr during the Clinton years.</p>
<p>Reports have come out over the past couple months about how the probe is investigating Trump for obstruction of justice, and that Mueller has impaneled grand juries, capable of issuing subpoenas.</p>
<p>These reports and more have relied on anonymous sources, against whom Rosenstein cautioned could be unreliable. He dubbed these reports, &quot;speculation in the news media.&quot;</p>

            Seems like Rosenstein is a rubber stamp for Mueller.  After all, Rosenstein named the special investigator with powers over Trump despite there being no evidence of Trump involvement.  Rosenstein is just trying to use an excuse for why this is not a fishing expedition when it actually is.

             Trump doesn't have a get out of jail free card.  If as they look crimes committed by others they find evidence of crimes involving Trump they will charge him.  That is not having special powers over Trump that is the rule of law.  If during this investigation, they were to find that I have committed crimes or you have committed crimes they can charge us.   Again that is not have special powers over us, that is a legitimate exercise of law enforcement.
            </p>
            <p>
             Trump is in legal jeopardy because there is a very, very strong case that he has engaged in multiple acts of obstruction of justice.  We shall see how that plays out.

             I don't see this as Rosenstein reigning in Mueller.  I see this as no change. Mueller was always bound by the rules of the special prosectuor, but he was also always able to prosecute other crimes that were revealed during his investigation.
Here's the Washington's Posts take from the same interview.
            </p>
            <blockquote>
             <p>
              Rosenstein: Special counsel Mueller can investigate any crimes he uncovers in Russia probe
             </p>
             <p>
              Rosenstein said special counsel Robert S. Mueller III can investigate any crimes that he might discover within the scope of his probe, but the deputy attorney general would not discuss which individuals are the subject of their inquiry. The interview comes days after Trump said he believes it would be inappropriate for Mueller to dig into Trump family finances.
             </p>
             <p>
              “The special counsel is subject to the rules and regulations of the Department of Justice, and we don’t engage in fishing expeditions,” Rosenstein said when asked about the probe in an interview on “Fox News Sunday.”

                 His long relationship is simply they worked together on friendly terms.   Nothing about that violates the DOJ conflict of interest rules.  You should actually read what they are.  They are geared towards financial interests of which there are none and for personal relationships, they are geared toward the
                 <strong>
                  subject
                 </strong>
                 of the criminal investigation who is not Comey.  There's nothing that says a prosecutor can't take a case because he knows a witness.  They witness still has to tell the truth.  Nothing about that would interfere with the prosecutor ethically peforming his job.
                </p>
                <p>
                 And guess what many other DOJ figures are witnesses in this case, because Comey talked to all the high level DOJ officials as this was happening, so finding a federal prosecutor who doesn't know these folks would probably be pretty difficult.

                  It's the problem for the prosecutors to find someone appropriate.  These are not optional rules and it's clearly a conflict of interest according to the official DOJ rules on the matter.

                        He just has to be involved in the conduct in a substantial way.  Do you agree that the accuser and the special investigator should be buddy-buddy?  That's only going to undermine the confidence in the investigation with the investigator and his close, personal friend as the accuser.

                         This is completely false.  And Rosenstein would have known these rules when he appointed Mueller.  Mueller is a man with reputation for great integrity.  There's nothing here that runs afoul of any rules at DOJ.  It's a complete non-issue.  And were there an issue the remedy need not be Mueller being removed.  He could simply apply for an ethics ruling and abide by the rules.  One easy solution would be have one of the dozen or sort federal attorney's working on this case handle the Comey stuff.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                         It's false they are buddy-buddy.     It's a fiction being pushed by the same folks who are pushing the fiction that there is any conflict based on DOJ rules.  And they are pushing it because they are trying to find any reason to get Robert Mueller removed.
                        </p>

                         It's nonsense for the internet and cable TV.  Inside the DOJ, this is nothing.
