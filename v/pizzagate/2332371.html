            So our favorite former A list teen actor who we will call A has a good friend who is a B- list do anything actor who is a celebrity offspring of a celebrity offspring and was given an important role in a movie which is supposed to highlight what our teen actor has gone through in his life. We shall call this double celebrity offspring B.
           </p>
           <p>
            B is really feeling the heat from the public this week. It turns out that someone (C)  accused of doing something awful to A's best friend back in the day is buddy buddy with B. That has to be awkward. "You know A, I know that C made your life miserable and raped your friend, but I'm friends with him."
           </p>
           <p>
            To make things worse, B and C have been spotted flashing the same sign that A and his best friend used to do back in the day.
           </p>
           <p>
            C was the person who revealed his friendship with B. Is it for publicity? Probably. Did A have a part in it? Who knows at this point because A gets more shady by the day. C is a convicted rapist who has been publicly exposed in the past. My best guess is that C is calling out the crap that A is spinning and that B is in on it. I think A needs to watch what he does very carefully. People are learning he is not who he seems but just a guy out to make a buck. Maybe that is why all his recent co-workers in that musical project have been speaking out.

            I'm wondering who here has a tweeter,  was wondering if anyone has the balls to copy and paste this to Feldman,  you can even use my handle:
           </p>
           <p>
            If grabbing ass goes against everything you stand for than why do you MAKE your 'Angels' walk around in the 'Feldmansion' wearing lingerie or nude when you are in custody of a minor?  You wouldn't let your child 'in the industry'  but it certainly sounds like he's being inducted into the industry standards.

             Exactly that doesnt sound healthy at all. He supposedly controls what they eat and who they sleep with too...that is an ABUSE OF POWER at best or a sign of something worse think: RKelly.

            I read a comment of his saying that a child was having a 'consensual' sexual relationship with an adult.  That right there shows he hasn't worked through his childhood abuse.  Children CANNOT consent. That's why we have laws to protect them.  That's why adults are supposed to be responsible for their protection.  If he hasn't worked through his sexual abuse, he would see himself as complicit and therefore having consented to the sexual relationship.  He's looking at child abuse through the lens of a victim who's groomed, played and manipulated.

             Agree, well said. He is still stuck in his own abuse if he thinks a child can consent.

            Never got onboard with Feldman, not that people try to engage me and encourage me to reach out(I was a Hollyweird actor). Number 1, the guy has no credibility. Number 2, release the names. Number 3, why are you still trying to be a player number 4, WTF is up with that goofy shitty music and the wounded girls you recruited for backup singers number 5 that music and your performance are BEYOND ridiculous!! It is Obvious to me Cory is still clinging to some fame game that eclipsed him years ago and how is he still paying the bills cause it ain't the music. You hung out at Hef's, WHY?? Why did anyone hangout there?/ Hollywood is the greatest example of cheese balls and low rent people. I know, I was there, in that industry for 20 years. Plus, Cory and I had the same agency if not for a while the same agent (Doug Warner). He was kinda finished by 1990 if I remember right. One last thing, I don't doubt he was abused(duh) but what he is now and what he says....doesn't add up. Give us the names you freak. For your sake and other children. No TIME to fuck around making people wait so what, you get another cheese appearance on some talk show with some MSM whores

            Although I don't have an opinion one way or the other about this allegation---- I don't believe Corey is on as higher-moral-ground as he claims. He's a very sexual person....with orgies and all. Now I'm not begrudging this life choice.... but for him to be quoted as saying:  'this goes against everything he believes in......" is simply not true.
 Sure, he probably IS against pedophilia (rightly so) but he's certainly not against sexual exploitation. Which again, is fine. Just don't come off purer than thou

            I want to hear more about this, but I believe he is completely capable of doing this and probably has committed such acts in between the orgies and whatever the hell you call what he does with Corey's Angels.

             He grabbed an ass. What person isn't capable of doing that? Not saying it's ok, but it's not really a shocking behavior When compared to everything else that goes on. Is this all they can come up with on him? Don't they have anything else? I'm sure it's there

              Dont minimize the fact that he did this he is a MARRIED MAN as well as a"victim" so why would he treat another this way at this time in the whole metoo movement? Hes just STUPID! If this is what it will take to get him to shut up and stop trying to posture as if he is the head of this whole movement then GOOD I SAY!!! He needs to take a humble back seat and STFU.

               When did this happen? What were the circumstances? He is a musician who hangs out in clubs and bars. Have you ever been around that scene? Everyone grabs everyone's asses and it's not a big deal. I'm not saying that's what he did, maybe he was being creepy and weird with a woman, but maybe not. Without knowing the details this is ALL speculation. There's a lot of people out there who love a different kind of life and a slap on the ass or a grab isn't seen as a big deal like if you were a person who hangs out in other environments. Not defending Feldman, some things don't add up with him, but honestly an ass grab isn't the end of the world!

                Hey I HAVE spent much of my life working in bars stripping so I am far from a prude I am saying when you are whining for money talking about being abused in years gone past you might need to speak to your agent and ask he/she if grabbing someone without their consent is kosher...If they have half a brain their answer will be a certain hell NO! I got grabbed all the time with that same attitude in mind and believe me they might have been thinking oh shes a stripper in a strip club when in rome right but I certainly didnt always agree....best to weigh on cautions side, espicially when you claim to be a victim and curse those that made victims...just sayin.

              I understand why you would minimalize this behavior,  I think we can all attest that our moral compass or Overton window has slid slightly to one side regardless if it is imperceptible to you or even us. Even though I have never engaged in that behavior at the outset it seems humorous to us males,  but why?  It's because we were slowly conditioned to believe that behavior is alright,  when in reality the gesture is and always was menacing and assaulting. Period. It's a violation of a person's private space you were not invited to invade.  It feels like a remnant from the 30's and 40's that misogynist men wouldn't let go.

              Secondly,  this is one incident,  the maxim usually holds true that if your willing to do it once and just happen to get caught one time,  chances are you've done it many times.
             </p>
             <p>
              Feldman has shown us enough behind the scenes and let slip enough about himself that doesn't paint too perty of a picture.

             <p>
              One example,  he makes all his 'angels'  wear lingerie if anything at all in his house,  WHERE HIS CHILDREN HAVE BEDROOMS, how much they live there is beyond me regarding his custody issues (why divorced?),  but that doesn't sound like responsible parenting to me. Shit,  CPS saw that in an article about any of us and our kids would be gone.

               Well said Solo.  It is UTTERLY condescending and reinforces an objectification of the female.

               Didn't Sheen have angels?  Corey Feldman is basically taking his role.

             It appears as though Feldmans gerrymandering has brought him some negative attention.  Of course this happened.  Even his ONSCREEN narcissism is a dead giveaway of his offscreen behavior. It's disappointing to see him deny these accusations,  his chance is waning on admitting his illness and the effect it has had on his life and what he has gotten himself wrapped up in.  They'll only come after him harder now.

              And to think, he's pretending to be the hero that he actually could be if he weren't knee-deep in the swamp. He knows where the bodies are buried and went along with it even selling out his best friend. Really pathetic.

             So very  much agree. I don't put anything past him or the others like Sheen.  Who knows what this is about anyways, possibly a fake report to make him look heterosexual if he is gay (so many of them are) and living a lie.  Or he is one of them.  One of the ones he says he feels so sorry for.  Maybe more will come out, and he will get his just due.  I hope there is a long line of accusers forming on the right.

               P is for Pervert 2 of the Comments When are these ugly #metoo stories of the children finally come out? I look every day for a story to break. We need the exploitation of the children to stop. Someone needs to take one for the team and expose this ugly fungus to daylight. AND This is no scandal; it's an industry-traded secret. Jeffrey Ballard hurt and continues to hurt young actors. He drugged and buggered Ricky Schroeder and repped Corey Feldman during Gremlins. When did it become okay to blame the victims of sex crime simply to advance your career? AMAZING

                I'm waiting for that myself. Not sure if there were NDA signed in some of these cases. Even if there were, they would have been with the kid's parents.

                My opinion? They're scared. Children that are molested are powerless, and when they grow up, they sometimes don't feel any differently. They're still a kid when placed in that situation -- especially facing their attacker. It's just the way it is so it really does take a lot to let go. The fact that the pedo elite are still in control doesn't help. I mean, that dog and pony show they put on was ridiculous. But as long as it controls, it's going to be difficult to get them to step forward.
