<p>As explained by Tracy Twyman, the work is related to Aleister Crowley Liber LXXVII. Which also shows on Exorcist III.

<p>You can relate the work also to this scene from the Exorcist I

<p>NOW THIS IS IMPORTANT
This work from Louise Bourgeois is called Father and Son. The son has an erection.
<a href="https://i.pinimg.com/originals/09/02/e9/0902e9ee9021ab92bfacebddac6b9c1e.jpg">https://i.pinimg.com/originals/09/02/e9/0902e9ee9021ab92bfacebddac6b9c1e.jpg</a></p>
<p>This one is another version of Father and son. Again the son with an erection.

<p>Here is the same work with the same name. A sculpture from her in Seattle. Of course, people complained that it was a pedo thing.

<p>Here is an article defending the artist\'s conception and calling the right wing basically &quot;stupid&quot; for thinking the work is pedo oriented. But, it clearly IS pedo oriented judging from the series.
<a href="http://www.seattlepi.com/news/article/Right-wing-having-an-art-attack-over-nude-1184168.php">http://www.seattlepi.com/news/article/Right-wing-having-an-art-attack-over-nude-1184168.php</a></p>
<p>She also has a work called &quot;The Destruction of the Father&quot;. Where she states “It is basically a table, the awful and terrifying family dinner table headed by the father who sits and gloats. And the others, the wife and children, what can they do? They sit there in silence. The mother, of course, tries to satisfy the tyrant, her husband. The children are filled with exasperation. […] So, in anger, they grabbed the man, threw him on the table, dismembered him and proceeded to devour him.” (1997)

<p>She also loves making cages, called &quot;cell&quot;s and putting tortured people inside of it.

            This one is called "Drift". The art curator says it simbolizes a Cross. It is usually positioned in front of the following work.

            In front of the cross. The dead chicken. Inverted cross. Remember the wikileak mail "i will sacrifice a chicken in the backyard for Moloch"?

            Actually you can get Opisthotonus from "any reduced brain function or injury to the nervous system"
The Dahmer victim got them because acid was injected in the brain directly. So forensics believes they adopted that position naturally (later he beheaded them). He injected acid in their brain because he wanted to make a mind control slave for himself.
If Bourgeois inspiration was only hysteria and epilepsia, then why he beheaded them?
But in truth, maybe he was not inspired in Dahmer. Considering Freud, the work relates directly to an idea of circle returning. Not forward, but going backwards towards the repressed and the fact that it is headless outlines an inability to process any feelings/thoughts. In conclusion you are stuck in an eternal loop, PROGRAMMED TO DO SO BECAUSE YOUR MIND IS GONE.

            This work has nothing to do with Aleister Crowley or the Exorcist.  That's your interpretation.

            The artist has been quite clear about her inspiration.  It was Jean-Martin Charcot, a 19th neurologist who studied hysteria and influenced Freud.

             Charcot the neurologist who Bourgeois has cited has her inspiration (and who was a teacher of Freud) talked about the arc de cercle that hysterical patients and epileptics sometimes suffered.

            You can claim her "Cells" are jails, but how does that explain all the Cells that have nobody in them, tortured or otherwise?  How does this simplistic interpretation account for this?

            It's about a collection of objects. Museum goers could not walk among the objects but had to consider them all together.  In that way, it's less like sculpture and more like a theater set.  They are world's you peer into.

            </p>
            <p>
             If the objective of the Cell/Jail is mind programming through torture and drugs you can imagine a great deal of abstract thinking goes into it. Anybody will be seeing flying spheres around, perceptions distorts. The perception of your inner self can very well distort to become those lumps of flesh she portraits so expressively.

                Maybe some Freud related bs that justifies that every son wants to screw his dad. 
 We are talking about Freud here. He received childhood abused patients and stated "These are fantasies. My patients are lying"
And lets not forget about his grandson. All jew elite pedophile.

            The last picture you posted truly has me believing even more that Alefantis' Pegasus place was used for this type of action. I remember some months ago someone had found pics of the place just before Alefantis bought. In the an upstairs room the ceiling looked typical. Then photos were posted of entire place being gutted.  If you remember Alefantis had a second floor staging area designed that you could push to one side of the room or the other.  On one side of the room's ceiling JA placed directly in the middle of the ceiling, this massive black iron ring.  He wasn't hanging plants from it. This was not in place before the renovation. Were kids hanging from it and have people view from first floor or up close and personal from second floor that slid over.  I have never forgotten this because why was that ring purposely put in place after the renovation.
