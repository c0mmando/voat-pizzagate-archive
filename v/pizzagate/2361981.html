For those of you that don\'t know it, it\'s a story of an adult hitman, looks to be in 40s, that takes in a 12 year old girl. Throughout the movie she is dressed in short skirts, short shirts and even underwear. She tells the hitman Leon that she\'s in love with him, tries to get kisses, tells him she wants her first time to be good with him and tells someone they are lovers. She plays a game where she dresses in lingerie pretending to be Madonna, singing like a virgin and also seductively sings a happy birthday as a heavily made-up Marilyn Monroe. She also smokes and drinks in the film.</p>
<p>Leon ignores her attempts and spits up milk twice with her flirting. He does leave the apartment once after she confesses her feelings for him and he leans up against the wall to breathe... we can speculate that he\'s tempted by this girl. He ends up telling her how happy she has made him and telling her he loves her. They also cuddle in bed together. While the film can be viewed as a cute child crush that\'s denied, there is no reason to dress a cute little girl up in sexy outfits, doing seductive things to a much older man. It\'s creepy and it promotes pedophilia, violence, smoking &amp; getting children drunk.</p>
<p>What\'s interesting is the movie is all over youtube, like here <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_fy901db2aAYouTube">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_fy901db2aAYouTube</a>, unlike other films that are removed. Reading over some reviews on Imdb, it seems the director casts a lot of very young women in roles.</p>
<p>There is an Italian restaurant at the start of the film, it has a pig on the window. There are pigs throughout the film, as decorations and an oven mitt / toy. Alefantis also mentions pigs a lot and has pictures of pig eyes. In mythology, which JA is big on, pigs are associated with the underworld.</p>
<p>From: <a href="https://amethjera.blogspot.com/2012/08/pigs-in-pagan-myth.html">https://amethjera.blogspot.com/2012/08/pigs-in-pagan-myth.html</a> Pigs were often associated with the underworld: it is believed that swineherds can cross the veil unimpeded. Because of this they were associated with demons and spirits. In the Biblical story where Jesus casts the demons into a herd of swine, the modern understand in of the symbolism is that he did so because the swine were considered unclean and according to the story were at once driven mad and hurled themselves off a cliff. [Mark 5:12, Revised Standard Version] The writers of the Old Testament were scholars of antiquity and as such often wove obscure occult facts into Biblical text: pigs, as sacred animals of the underworld, would have been able to have been possessed by the demons and carry them off without being harmed. This is why the demons made such an odd request of Jesus, and he complied. The additional caveat of them hurling themselves off a cliff echoed the reoccurring theme of the triumph of Good over Evil, when God throws Satan into the abyss, and was a later addition to the original story.</p>

             Gotta say, I was pretty disappointed with this movie's first DVD release; "The Professional" (No LÉON in the title). Full Screen, no special features, AND the cut of the film that runs 20+ minutes shorter? No thanks.

             In spite of the fact that some folks get their panties in a knot over this, and they may imagine all girls under 25 as lilly white? That comment is true: some girls, perhaps not the majority of girls, but some girls are confident in their sexuality, and drive the relationship into fast forward. It
             <em>
              may

               No problem.  The thing is, there are only 3 basic reasons for a post to be removed.  Only one of them (Rule 1)  determines what topics can be posted; that is the thorny one, and we have eased up on it lately, but it's necessary, because if anyone can post anything tangentially related, shills can flood the sub with posts and make it useless.  The whole point of the sub is to expose elites who facilitate and participate in child abuse, not a general forum for the problem of child abuse, and drawing that line can be very subjective. The other two main rules (Rules 2 and 3) are "fix and repost" rules, which should generally be very simple, because all one needs is to be clear about what you're saying and to have sources for any factual claims that aren't common knowledge.

            Please hear me out.... tbh, I loved that movie when I saw it, although it was years ago. My take is that Natalie Portman plays a young girl who has clearly been sexually abused by adult men in the past... perhaps raped, perhaps forcibly prostituted. She does not have parents, and certainly has never had a healthy relationship with an adult male-- one that is not sexually abusive. Tragically that is all she knows of love, attention and just trying to survive. Thus when she meets Leon, her behavior follows accordingly. Throughout the movie, he tries to do right and be a pure father figure to her. In the end, that is successfully achieved - they form a healthy, non abusive bond. She has a father figure and learns it is possible to have that relationship without being sexually exploited at the same time.

             Okay, you posted this again, I'll repost my reply:
            </p>
            <p>
             Yes but the point is that they are sexually exploiting a child for a movie. This shouldn't be allowed. Her attire, her sexual seductive nature shouldn't have been on film at all. A novel would be bad enough but actually using a child in little slutty clothes professing love and attraction to an old man is not okay, in any way, at all. Her parents put their feet down when it came to a scene where he walks in on her in the bathroom and she opens her towel saying, it's okay. Times are changing, we are all waking up now and seeing, hey...that's not okay. Why didn't we realize that before?

             The American movie 'R' rated cut is even more tame and removes some of the heavier pedo undertones.

            The BIG thing you're leaving out is that the film is based on a book where he fucks her.  I think in the director's cut the scene is included.

              Thanks, it's not. There isn't a book, the director wrote the screenplay.
             </p>
             <p>
              After researching,  tha_Dude is maybe referring to the scene that was cut where she talks about having sex with him. That scene was cut out in some countries.

               Yeah, sorry guys not trying to spread false info.  It was in the international version:
              </p>
              <blockquote>
               <p>
                The Missing Scene:
The international cut of the film reveals that the night before that scene, Mathilda tried to coax Leon into making love to her, but he turned her down because he "wouldn't be a good lover" (apparently there are no laws about having sex with minors in other countries, but there are plenty of laws about doing it lousily). Well, the screenplay takes the wrongness even further by making it clear that, actually, he does sleep with her. While crying. Here's the scene:
               </p>
               <p>
                "How beautiful it is seeing them sweetly making love" is an actual line that the screenwriter wrote. And no, she's isn't 30 instead of almost 13 in this draft.
               </p>
               <p>
                How It Changes the Movie:
For starters, this explains why Leon is so edgy the whole damn picture: On top of the corrupt DEA agent, he also had to be on the lookout for Child Protective Services busting his ass for pedophilia. But mainly, it confirms our hunch that there was something fishy going on in this movie all along. We'll never look at Luc Besson pictures the same way again.
               </p>
              </blockquote>
              <p>
               I thought it was originally a book.  I was wrong but not about the part in question.

              The post is not fully deleted (it goes to removed submissions log).  All OP has to do is copy and paste and identify the needed info.  Do you expect me to be perfect and to spend 10 minutes thoroughly inspecting every single post?  I'm going to miss things sometimes.  To expect otherwise is just nonsense.  Maybe have some appreciation that I've been doing this for a year, all the while wishing there were someone else to do it.  I would rather be doing my part by continuing to expand the Executive Summary I spent weeks working on, but I'm not able to do that because nobody else seems willing to do the thankless job of moderating and take abuse from assholes like

              There is apparently one scientist who believes that the missing link in evolution is that an ancient primate ancestor actually  mated with a wild boar type animal and that is how human beings were formed.  He said that this explained why the pig anatomy is so similar to humans (we use pig's heart valves to replace human heart valves) and the other similarities (pinkish, hairless skin, same fat distribution, etc.)  He also said this may be why it was taboo to eat pork -- because we are related to them.  I forget his name, but it was an interesting theory and made me glad that I'm a vegetarian because I will never look at pigs quite the same way, though I've no idea if this  man is correct or completely nuts.
