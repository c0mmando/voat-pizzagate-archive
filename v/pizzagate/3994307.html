<p>Her family Maccobys were personal lawyers and friends of James Alefantis, also running orphanages on Haiti which were connected by human trafficker Puello words to attempted human trafficking by Laura Silsby:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In a jailhouse interview Saturday, <strong>Silsby told the AP that most of the children had been delivered to the Americans by distant relatives, while some came from orphanages that had collapsed in the quake</strong>.The missionaries\' lawyer, Jorge Puello, told the AP on Wednesday &quot;they willingly accepted kids they knew were not orphans because the parents said they would starve otherwise.&quot;The parents of four children taken by Silsby said the Americans took down contact information for all the families and assured them that a relative would be able to visit them in the Dominican Republic.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>VAN SUSTEREN: Where did they find these 33 children? How did they get these children?</p>
<p>PUELLO: <strong>There was an orphanage that collapsed in Haiti. It was called friends of the orphans of Haiti</strong>. And there was somebody over there that told them that the orphans had no place, no room to place them.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This article points out Nora\'s brother and father involvement in very important jobs in those specific orphanages:</p>

<p>But lays a little bit skepticism about Puello claims.</p>
<p>Here is ex CIA agent Robert David Steele in Nora Maccoby\'s house:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0O0N1Jnyns">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0O0N1Jnyns</a></p>
<p>Where he talks how Nora allowed her art to be on this book cover about satanic pedophlia empire for which Robert wrote foreword, it\'s basically called Pedophilia Empire.</p>
<p>It describes Pizzagate as well:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Pizzagate and the Podestas and Clintons, the Weiners and Jeffrey Epstein are merely the tip of the iceberg to this pedophilic black holed world that’s ruled over this planet for eons of time.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But she claimed as shown before by me that Pizzagate is fake and here she claims that very evil people are behind spreading those theories:</p>

            Anneke Lucas has said she will not give the names of her abusers. I can totally understand her reticence.  However, I cannot feel sorry for people like Maccoby who know what's going on but won't tell someone, anyone, even anonymously.  If people know, they should be speaking up.

             Thank you for this comment. I agree with you. Also she admits to me she's smoking pot and she doesn't have much money. 100% agree that we shouldn't tak her word for anything on Pizzagate topic. No one normal with morals will justify Alefantis suspicious pattern of behavior. So either she is innocent and rejected all the findings about it without researching them or she knows something about Alefantis being pedo and she is indeed partially responsible for this situation.

            So have you asked your friend Nora about the Alefantis family at all?  Questions like, is the Alefantis family CIA too?
           </p>
           <p>
            Why  was James Alefantis, pizza guy, listed as one of the most influential men in Washington?
           </p>
           <p>
            Is there anybody here who ISN'T CIA?  It's quite clear to me her brain has been scrambled. Ever notice in CIA families with a number of siblings there is always at least one who ends up in the arts and is on the loopy side?

             it's a long and twisting story, taking in a water-polo scholarship to Pepperdine University in Malibu, the discovery of the punk grunge scene in downtown LA and the entirely flukish circumstances that led him into Perry Farrell's orbit: Jane's Addiction was looking for a writer to collaborate on a project, and the band's manager read in the local paper that Cohen had won a fiction competition and got in touch...
            </p>
            <p>
             Cohen lived the rock'n'roll lifestyle. And not any old rock'n'roll lifestyle. Jane's Addiction were notoriously wild drugged-up exhibitionists. The first time he saw them performing, Perry Farrell appeared on stage naked covered in blood...
            </p>
            <p>
             And they approached Perry and said: 'Can you recruit musicians for this Drop the Debt campaign?' And I was Perry's executive director, so the request came through me, and I just thought: 'Wow, this is a divine miracle!' So we pulled out Perry's Rolodex and contacted David Bowie and

              Her friend Robert David Steele said a while back that us pizzagate researchers didn't know what we were doing and dismissed us.  Well, here we are a couple of years later, still here and even now driving the media narrative.  He's had to adjust his position and alter what he says quite considerably to flow with the public tide.  I've got that arrogant arsehole's number.

              In this rare video above, Nora Maccoby told the world that she was born in Mexico. She told the world about the CIA, her upbringing and neighborhood of the CIA.
             </p>
             <p>
              In June 1960, Dr. Maccoby received a PhD from Harvard in Social Relations. Dr. Henry Alexander Murray was a central figure in Harvard’s interdisciplinary Department of Social Relations. He retired from Harvard in 1962.[15] Who is Dr. Henry Murray? Psychologist Dr. Henry Alexander Murray (May 13, 1893 – June 23, 1988) of Harvard University was the CIA’s preeminent elder statesman. During World War II, he left Harvard as the director of the Harvard Psychological Clinic to join the Office of Strategic Services (OSS) as a lieutenant colonel. For Allied Forces, particular America and Britain, Dr. Murray developed special psychological assessment tests to recruit and select secret agents.[16] He joined with the Schools and Training Branch of the OSS to write an entire book about the recruitment of special agents called Assessment of Men. The title was later changed to Selection of Personnel for Clandestine Operations: Assessment of Men.[17]

            Denying Pizzagate is "real" is easy for these people because to them that means only one thing: the media version that said Hillary Clinton was traffficking kids out of Comet's basement, which we all (should) know, isn't or wasn't ever accurate. They can deny it on those grounds easily. Pizzagate, to the MSM, is fraudulent because their associates helped perpetuate the most ludicrous version of this story in order to destroy its credibility. If there was never any basement to begin with then the whole story unravels. Or at least, that's how they sell it. It was never about a basement, but it was about a venue.

              I don't believe the "killroom" thing either, or at least, not as it was presented to us all (as a cool room used to kill people in, mysteriously located somewhere). I have a little more on that "killroom" image, something that I know would set fire to this sub and send everyone crazy, but it's not something I believe to be what it
              <em>
               looks
              </em>
              like it is, so I haven't shared that thus far because I only ever want to share what I believe is factual findings.

               You should definitely share it tho. I believe otherwise - I think all the people whos pattern of behavior was suspicious were connected to killroom "thing" and even the guy creating child sized coffin like constructions named its project like that "killroom". That's just my own take.

                Oh I certainly believe that they were all involved in something, and something centred on that location/people. But I don't believe that image of the "killroom" was anything more than a typical restaurant cooler, from what else I've seen, anyway. But yeah, the fact that two of the main guys involved spread from DC to Portland and San Diego, at roughly the same time seems very suspicious.

                 Is there anyone on the pizzagate sub or does anyone here know someone specializing in commercial refrigeration that could comment on whether the "kill room" is in fact a typical restaurant cooler. It looks to me more of a mobile truck outfitted with modified air conditioners. Or is it from a foreign country?

                  Yes it is typical, those kinds of things were looked into heavily when it all started, and I believe it is actually the cooler of a nearby restaurant, someone Alefantis is friends with.

             Good question. I would ask myself this question. Why does woman so close to the core of Pizzagate allegations knows ( since 90s! )  alleged victim of satanic ritual abuse in European/Belgium ring of influential people. Why did Steele said that Pizzagaters got false leads on Maccoby family, why is he talking about satanic ritual abuse in this weird, almost freemason like event, why is he close to Nora Maccoby, why did she allowed her art to be on this book about satanic pedophilia?
            </p>
            <p>
             I don't know what to make of this finally but I find it very interesting that those additional findings can be made so close to core of Pizzagate allegations.

            That convo is something else. Why is she dishing to a random person on IG? The question is HOW did she ever end up meeting Anneke? I know Anneke was in the US in the 90s but I can only think of the dead American who abused, raped and had her sent to a German MK Ultra lab for a couple months as being the gateway to people in the US. Also not to forget he brought her into his homes in NY and Maine for months at 9 to 11 years old.

             I have no idea why she says these things to me, I've just asked after new Mouthy Buddha documentary why she shared her art on that book but conversation became more interesting. Needed to share as fast as possible in case something will happen to my account and I won't have access to conversation anymore.

            Great review and recap thread. The Haiti earthquake shit is what originally brought me to this board in 2016.

            , can you add the links to archives of the Instagram comments from Maccoby about Lucas that you included screencaps of?  Those can be faked. This post would be stronger with the actual links.

             This is basically conversation of me with her and when I try to add archive it doesn't work. But I've done screenshot of whole conversation page and just added it.
