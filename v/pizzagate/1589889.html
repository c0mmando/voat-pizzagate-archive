            James Comey kept Martin Armstrong in prison for 7 years- without trial- on contempt of court.  Personally, I think he is a prick who doesn't care about justice.  That said, I think that the heat will certainly be turned on under his ass by members of the fbi with a moral compass.  So I have no idea how this plays out.

            Yes but he almost immediately decided to close it again, stating that nothing in the additional emails would change the outcome. But he next stated that it would take five years (until after the NEXT election) to thoroughly review the 650,000 additional emails.
These were contradictory statements to say the least.
Comey has a loooong history of letting the Clintons off the hook.

             You'd probably close it, too, if you got death threats from it. (This is Hillary, afterall, and her puppet master Soros.) Maybe there's a chance he feels safer now.  Or maybe he's being kept around a while until they figure out what he knows. Can't exactlywater board him to talk. Maybe I'm just way too hopeful but I feel like DT doesn't do things without a reason and I've yet to see proof he's "one of them."  But the fact is to get info as an outsider you need insiders... i guess we'll see. ..

            But didn't George Webb mention that Comey could have been a victim of a Brownstone (blackmail) entrapment? And therefore his hands are tied?

            This is a horrible sign. Comey was bought off long ago. He was on the board of HSBC which is probably the world's largest money launderer. Think BCCI on steroids. He was also working for Lockheed for a little bit which along with Boeing and DynCorp are probably the top 3 players in the  Military Industrial Complex.

            I don't mean to be blunt but this is game over for PizzaGate. The only thing we've got left is to pester NYPD's Robert Boyce:

            Boyce said he'd release the 650,000 Weiner emails if no one did anything. It's freakin' sad but that's where we are right now everybody.

             You might be right about it being game over. But I lean toward the notion that Trump has an insider at his dispossal to help him bring it down in exchange for immunity. Some say Comey did want to let the cat out of the bag about Clinton but had to stop because if threats.

             I agree but Comey will have to answer to Sessions. I wouldn't keep Comey around but he definitely seems to have some bad blood with the Clintons. The fact that he re-opened the investigation and left it open until the day before the election is a power move. He knew it would do irreparable damage to Hillary but at the same time he hedged his bets in case she won. If Comey straight up had her arrested I don't think he would be alive today.

              "hedged his bets"......I see both of your points. And Trump doesn't want to crash the stock market and if half of this shit is real then bringing it down could be catastrophic. It's the economy stupid. Yes it's pathetic and Trump doing nothing would piss me off greatly but everything is tied to the economy and stock market. Trump doesn't wants to fuck it up. But who the fuck knows at this point.

               Trump has stepped in the viper's pit.  What the hell do you do when you walk into an absolute flipping mess?  Start firing everyone?   No, you take time to look at things.  Regardless of anything that happens, Trump has upset the apple cart big time?.  If clinton got in....do you think the fine researchers at Voat would be allowed to continue this long?  I'm not so sure.

             I despise Comey and I'd be inclined to agree with you. But, I think it's possible that this is a play; Comey is undoubtedly compromised, as shown by his cover for Hillary and then half-caving before the election. Given that Comey surely has some tales to tell, maybe he and Trump have come to an agreement. I know Ttump isn't the type to forget Hillarys indiscretions. If this is the case it's still not ideal, I was holding out for martial law for a month followed by 80% of politicians, bankers, CPS officials, foster families shot on Capitol Hill, at this stage I don't expect much, but hoping at least a dent
Is made. They need to face justice this time.

            No it is not. Comey has gone soft on the Clintons over and over again for the past ten years or so. (As per George Webb's YouTube videos.)
