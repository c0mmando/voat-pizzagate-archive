            I used to sell heroin. I used to use bitcoin to procure large amounts of heroin back in its early days. I'm gunna say this with 100 percent confidence and certainty, the entirety of the deepweb is one giant criminal money laundering scam that (((they))) use to move CIA drugs and child pornography.
           </p>

            David Seaman and his connection to the bitcoin world is suspect as fuck. Bitcoin = criminal money schemes. I've seen some really fucked up shit on there. I get physically sick thinking about it tbqh

            As a side convo - I've looked largely at cannabis related transactions there. I know enough to know what I see in other categories.
           </p>
           <p>
            My supposition is this: 2 FOR 1 - Drugs and pedo.
           </p>
           <p>
            Opiod deaths are off the charts in the US. One could argue that it is an easy operation against the US - get them hooked. Once you understand the economics behind synthetic opiods and how drugs are moved on the dark web, it is pretty simple to understand.
           </p>
           <p>
            A foreign government (DPRK and China) has determined to flood our drug addicted supply routes with drugs so powerful that an envelope worth will get you high until you die.
           </p>
           <p>
            This is another form of asymmetric warfare. Let us kill ourselves.
           </p>
           <p>
            This is not BS. 500.00 will buy you enough (or would until last Tue) synth opioids to kill plenty. This was by design. To kill America.

            <strong>
             I'm from Canada. I'm also addicted to Fentanyl,
            </strong>
            a lot of people are (this country is a marxist shithole I wanna die everyday). This shit literally comes from clandestine laboratories in china. The chinese are also notorious for laundering money through our housing market and transferring their currency over through bitcoin. I'm not gunna even pretend to understand the magnitude of all this but I know for certain that criminals are the ones using this. I also know people who work for CSIS and they (along with the rest of the intelligence community) are obsessed with crypto, I know that much.

            Seriously dude. I hope you get some help. Don't wast your time on this BS. This stuff is too much for your should to handle if you are being sincere. Politics and agendas aside - I've watched people die from this shit. You can recover and you will understand one day.

            Being damned and being in purgatory are two entirely different things.

            Look into the history of TOR and how it's been used to overthrow governments in the Arab spring. Look into it's origins and then come back and tell me that Bitcoin and the Deepweb are good.

            I used to sell heroin. I used to use bitcoin to procure large amounts of heroin back in its early days. I'm gunna say this with 100 percent confidence and certainty, the entirety of the deepweb is one giant criminal money laundering scam that (((they))) use to move CIA drugs and child pornography.

             As a side convo - I've looked largely at cannabis related transactions there.  I know enough to know what I see in other categories.

             Opiod deaths are off the charts in the US.  One could argue that it is an easy operation against the US - get them hooked.  Once you understand the economics behind synthetic opiods and how drugs are moved on the dark web, it is pretty simple to understand.

             A foreign government (DPRK and China) has determined to flood our drug addicted supply routes with drugs so powerful that an envelope worth will get you high until you die.

             This is another form of asymmetric warfare. Let us kill ourselves.

             This is not BS.  500.00 will buy you enough (or would until last Tue) synth opioids to kill plenty.  This was by design.  To kill America.

              I'm from Canada. I'm also addicted to Fentanyl, a lot of people are (this country is a marxist shithole I wanna die everyday). This shit literally comes from clandestine laboratories in china. The chinese are also notorious for laundering money through our housing market and transferring their currency over through bitcoin. I'm not gunna even pretend to understand the magnitude of all this but I know for certain that criminals are the ones using this. I also know people who work for CSIS and they (along with the rest of the intelligence community) are obsessed with crypto, I know that much.

               I feel your pain hnj. For me it was alcohol. There's no difference really. In fact alcohol is turned into morphine in the advanced stages of alcoholism. About 10 years into heavy drinking I stopped getting hangovers and I had to start drinking in the morning to fight withdrawals (DTs). It was horrible.

               Don't quit before the miracle! Again I was right there with you. I thought I could never be happy again. Boy was I wrong. All I can provide you is the fact I made it through and am 1000 times better than before. It's hard to describe. Don't give up is all I can tell you. It's worth all the pain you went through in the end. It's called the pink cloud. If you do make it through there's a prize at the end. Normal everyday life is turned into the closest thing to heaven you've ever seen without being doped up, drunk or dead. It blew me away when I first saw it.

                     If you're dicking w/ Fentanyl, you're in purgatory.  Waiting to live or waiting to die.  Which one is it?

               Seriously dude.  I hope you get some help.  Don't wast your time on this BS.  This stuff is too much for your should to handle if you are being sincere.  Politics and agendas aside - I've watched people die from this shit.  You can recover and you will understand one day.

            this totally sounds plausible, especially adding organ trafficking in the mix for an even larger global market. I wonder how the German pedo bust was called Elysium.

               Not trying to open another avenue of approach, but no one - here, that I'm aware of - has even looked into the organ donor infrastructure at state level.

                Well, I wouldn't call them donors, more like victims. But the Seth Rich investigation, revealing the close ties between H and her minions and the hospital kind of illustrates how that would work. I also don't think that CHAI got enough attention. Maybe CHAI is part of the organ trafficking mechanism since they were doing the pharmaceutical price fixing and drug diluting already.

                 I missed the "CHAI" reference.
                </p>
                <p>
                 What I do know is that there was a lot of synthetic blood trials in this area.  The EULA inside the "organ donor" checkbox allowed "big pharma" to come in and make "life saving" experiments.
                </p>
                <p>
                 I've had some experience in trauma treatment and can say that some of the best innovations are based on crazy crap.  Example - Quik-Clot, the number one reason battlefield casualties have dropped dramatically, is based on the chitin contained in lobsters, shellfish, whatever.
                </p>
                <p>
                 It's the same thing with synthetic blood.  There were trials about 10 years ago where - essentially - if you lived in the test area and were coding inbound, they could administer this treatment.
                </p>
                <p>
                 Google "mice breath water" and it will make sense.

                   If you've ever been in a trauma-rich environment, some make it, some don't.  It all depends on the triage and the rules.

                  <p>
                   Go in  - kill 50 people, 80% signed the organ donor slot.  What's that...40 people X 600k/pp = 24mm bucks.  2 or 4 mil go to the police benevolent association.  A few more to get everyone else to STFU?

                    yes,  car accidents are either too safe or too messy, so yeah, I see it. But the opioid/fentanyl crap is straight out poison and killing a lot of people, intentionally for their organs, I believe. I think young kids are targeted for heroin for a reason.

             Some are questioning this site and also newswire as well.  The press conference they predicted has not occurred as of yet.  We will have to keep on this.  Someone said there was a Reuters article but I cannot find it.

               Sometimes when articles are posted on here there are people that question certain sites saying they are not reputable.  I did not say that included me.  I just mentioned that members on here have said that, along with newswire, sorcha fal etc.
