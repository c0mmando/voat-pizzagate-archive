           <p>
            Why didn't you look into what those groups are doing?
           </p>
           <p>
            You almost couldn't have recommended groups that one would more want to avoid.  5 out of 5 bad ones.
           </p>
           <p>
            The first two groups murder children while pretending to care about them.

             "Save the Children," Connected to the CIA, Is KILLING Children with Vaccines
            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            The ASPCC actually celebrates foster care which can be used for pedophilia or child trafficking.
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             Foster care is substitute care for babies, children, and youth, placed away from their parents or guardians and for whom the State agency has placement and care responsibility. This includes, placements in foster family homes, foster homes of relatives, group homes, emergency shelters, residential facilities, child care institutions, and preadoptive homes.&gt;
            </p>
           </blockquote>
           <p>
            The places listed are infamous for sexual abuse of children.
           </p>
           <p>
            And "Shaken Baby Syndrome" that ASPCC wants to "stand up against" is a misdiagnosis for vaccine injury.  When a baby collapses after a vaccine, the parent goes for help.  Rather than admit the vaccine did the damage, the doctor or hospital calls the police and the parent can end up in prison for trying to help their child.  So this organization is actually NOT helping children which should include exposing that vaccines can do to babies (cause brain damage) and then to their parents if the baby is injured).

           <p>
            You are suggesting 2 groups actually known for killing children (with vaccines) and working with the CIA, and one promoting for Shaken Baby Syndrome (which is blaming parents for a baby's vaccine injury), one (NAPAC) with a very slick website that is interested in research, working with academics and politicians, data collection and television scripts! ... and says. "Get in touch to find out more regarding costs and availability."  And the final one, APSAC, is connected to the New York Foundling which is backed by an astounding number of corporate groups - including UPS (why?) - and Catholic groups yet the Catholic orphanages and homes have a horrific history of satanic abuse of children and trafficking.
           </p>
           <p>
            Why would you think a promotion of specific groups - essentially an advertisement - would be a good meme?
           </p>
           <p>
            Who are you?  Are you being paid to do this?
           </p>
           <p>
            You're recommending the belly of the Beast.
