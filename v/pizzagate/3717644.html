<blockquote>
<p>An 18-year-old Racine man will spend nine months in jail and three years on probation for sexually assaulting two young women.</p>
<p>Matthew T. Lovrine, of the 5100 block of Ruby Avenue, was accused of also cutting the young women, biting them, and telling them he was a vampire when the crimes occurred about two years ago.</p>
<p>On Monday Racine County Circuit Judge Wayne Marik sentenced Lovrine to one and a half years in prison for felony child abuse and to nine months in prison for each of two counts of having sexual intercourse with a person younger than 16. Marik imposed the prison time, <strong>stayed it</strong>, and gave Lovrine three years\' probation with the provision that he undergo treatment, among other conditions.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So this guy sexually assaulted two minors under 16, cut them, drank their blood and messed with them psychologically by telling them he was a vampire, and he didn\'t spend a day in jail?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Marik also sentenced Lovrine to nine months in the county jail for possessing a dangerous weapon on school grounds.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Did the assault itself happen at a school? I can\'t tell from the article but it seems to imply that it might have.</p>
<p>This is apparently a big enough of an issue in this area that State Senator James R. Baumgart, Democrat from Sheboygan, drafted legislation aimed at criminalizing vampire or vampire-like activity directed at juveniles. Baumgart says the legislation will close <strong>loopholes in the law that hampered prosecution of Phillip K. Buck</strong> for his role in preying on teen-age girls. <a href="https://fvza.org/prcriminalize.html">https://fvza.org/prcriminalize.html</a></p>
<p>Who is Phillip K. Buck? <a href="https://www.sheboyganpress.com/story/news/2016/02/22/man-charged-threatening-woman-knife/80762798/">https://www.sheboyganpress.com/story/news/2016/02/22/man-charged-threatening-woman-knife/80762798/</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>A 57-year-old Adell man previously convicted of hosting vampire parties and who allegedly threatened to cut off his girlfriend’s head and place it on a stick has now been charged with disorderly conduct and intimidating a victim, a felony.</p>
<p>Phillip K. Buck was charged last week following an altercation with a woman on Monday, February 15.</p>
<p>The woman told officers that she had an argument with Buck at his home in the Village of Adell and that she tried to call 911, but that the defendant took her phone away. The woman said she tried to leave, but that Buck would not let her and threatened to kill her with a knife if she left. </p>
<p>Buck’s criminal history includes serving time in prison beginning in the late ‘90s for hosting a series of drinking parties with minors that led to sex, ritualistic self-mutilation and drinking of blood, in what the judge in this case described as a “bizarre funhouse.”</p>
<p>During trial, juvenile girls testified that he cut them with a razor or encouraged them to cut themselves, then sucked their blood. Others were tied to a bed and whipped while onlookers danced.</p>
<p>Buck was also sentenced to jail in 2007 for threatening to kill his mother because she had her cats fixed. Buck told his mother he would make her watch him kill the cats.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Buck is accused of having an underage drinking party during which a juvenile told authorities Buck drank blood from a 16-year-old girl.</p>
<p>The juvenile said he could hear Buck and the teen-aged girl in a back room and that Buck repeatedly told the girl he had a wooden stake and was going to kill himself, according to a criminal complaint.</p>
<p>The witness said he saw Buck give the girl a razor blade and heard Buck say “It would make you feel better,&quot; the complaint said.</p>
<p>The girl then used the razor blade to make about five cuts on her inner forearm that bled profusely, according to the complaint.</p>
<p>The witness said he then saw Buck sucking on the girl\'s arm for several minutes. The juvenile witness said this was not the first time such activities had occurred at Buck\'s home.</p>
<p>Buck denied the charges, <strong>telling a detective that kids often come over to his home</strong> and he has no control over them, authorities said.</p>
<p>Hoffmann said <strong>investigators believe there have been other incidents</strong>, such as the one involving Buck, but at this time he did not expect more arrests.</p>
<p>Investigators have no reason to believe that this vampire-like activity has any connection to <strong>reports of a group of people involved in such activity in Wisconsin Rapids</strong>, Hoffmann said</p>

<p>Interestingly, these aren\'t the only instances of someone from Wisconsin claiming to be a vampire.</p>

<p>23 year old Scott Mehtala claimed to be a vampire after punching a member of a band playing at the La Crosse Center called the \'American Fangs\', and drove a barricade through a window of the tour bus, according to police reports. The American Fangs are, not surprisingly, a vampire themed band:</p>

<p>There is also evidence that a Vampire has been stalking Mineral Point, Wisconsin since the 80\'s.</p>

            Here is another case from Wisconsin involving blood drinking from 2016
           </p>
           <p>
            www.wric.com/news/wisconsin-man-charged-after-cutting-off-womans-finger-drinking-her-blood/
           </p>

            <strong>
             Wisconsin man charged after cutting off woman’s finger, drinking her blood
            </strong>
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             The criminal complaint reads:
            </p>
            <p>
             Shelby [Neuns] had volunteered to let Jon [Schrap] drink her blood. Jon had taken a machete and made an approximate one inch laceration on her right side forearm. She was bleeding profusely… Jon filled up a shot glass with her blood and drank her blood.”
            </p>
            <p>
             Soon after, the group began talking about severing a finger. Again, Neuns volunteers, telling the men they could cut off her pinky. She stated that she was not using drugs or alcohol before this happened.
            </p>
            <p>
             Once again, Schrap grabbed the machete. “Jon’s second strike with the machete took the pinky clean off,” says the criminal complaint. “All the way to the palm.”
            </p>
            <p>
             “Jon then placed the finger in his freezer where he said he would cook it and eat it later,” the complaint continues. “The group then attempted to stop the bleeding by using a car cigarette lighter which failed. They then used a blowtorch.”
            </p>
            <p>
             Neuns told her boyfriend about the incident and the boyfriend’s mother made Neuns go to the emergency room.
             <strong>
              The emergency room staff at Saint Mary’s Hospital believed she had taken part in a cult initiation and contacted the authorities.
             </strong>
            </p>

            The reason this is flared a 24 Hour Grace is because it exposed Pedovores. Well not self rightous Pedo-Mod can allow that sp it must be stopped with censorship.
           </p>
           <p>
            The power of Censorship for touchy feely rules is why this sub is a Pedovore Honey Pot.

            Did you assholes get this good a censorship from Benito Mussolini? Or from the Jesuit Blackmailers at the F.B.I.?

             Racine is run by the VERY ELITE Johnson family. That isn't good enough?

                  Sorry bro but I don't have a narrative. I just took a good enough look at Racine to know that the uber wealthy Johnson family runs that town and its obvious that secret societies have been in place there since its beginning. You are not even making any sense.

                    Rules for Radicals was written by Saul Alinsky, who said that Satan was the first radical. One of the tactics they employ is accusing their opponents of exactly what they are guilty of.

                    Forum sliding is flooding a forum with garbage/unimportant topics to bury an important topic. I don't know who is doing the downvoting but the same 2-3 people are constantly downvoting almost everything I say in response to you.

                    I am not sure, I notice the last ban was 7 months ago. I am not sure what "Created by: Cynabuns" means but every single ban I can find says "created by Cynabuns". I clicked on some of them at random and noticed that some of them had pretty good posts. For example WinterWatch had posts that lead me to a video about 5G tech and smart cities:
                    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=riq5698ncvY">

                    </a>
                    and he also appears to have a site with what looks like good information at first glance: www dot winterwatch dot net/
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    Are you telling me that The Truth was already completely revealed by at least one banned user, and that I should be browsing through banned users to find it?

                    I don't know. She seems like a normal person to me. Are you saying I can't trust her, either? I  think it's interesting that you bring her up all of a sudden... are you somehow aware that I have started talking to her via private message? I contacted her to warn her about George Webb being part of Project Pogo.

                        Because they are building an advanced bot. I did not take it seriously when I first heard him say it, but "David Goldberg" said they were making an AI that could emulate the online presence of the people they were going to kill, to make it look like they had not really disappeared. Is this true?

                        If I am likely going to die, how can I help save others? I see one of your posts on a banned account said "They are closing the gate to heaven and opening the gate to hell". Is that The Truth they cannot allow the world to know? If it is, I cannot imagine that anyone would listen to me if I told them.

                            For killing people and sending out a message, I assume. Is that what will happen to those who get rounded up in Project Zyphr? Everyone who gets rounded up will be offered The Mark and if they refuse, they will be beheaded in front of everyone else to persuade them to take The Mark?

                            How can you say that one should not kill themselves when faced with frightening tortures that they may not be able to withstand, if being unable to withstand means they will likely take The Mark? I do not know if I can control myself in such a scenario.
                           </p>
                           <p>
                            I still don't understand why they cannot just physically restrain me and Mark me against my will. Certainly the laws of physics do not prevent them from doing this, so what does? If fear of Jesus or God is what prevents them from doing so, then why are they implementing the Mark at all? That would surely damn them. And if they are already damned, why would they care if Jesus or God forbids them from Marking people against their will?
                           </p>

                            Finally, can you please give me an answer as to whether or not you know what disturbed me so much the other night? A yes or a no is all I need. Is it possible that I am caught up in some kind of bizarre quantum synchronicity or something like that? This really messed with my mind.

                     .  I actually have a life outside of voat and it has suffered greatly because of the time I have spent researching threads here. On a number of occasions,  i have deleted my voat account to try to get semblence of a normal life but I'm always drawn back. Hence the new account name. Go through my posts. Many of them need more eyes.  Kind regards .

                      I will give your two accounts a look, there seem to be some great posts there. Out of curiosity, why do you think 'WhyisTheTruthBanned' wanted me to figure out that you were letsdothis3?

                       No idea. I don't involve myself in personal intrigue if I can help it. I suggest you don't either if you don't want to be distracted from what's important.

                   So, you see, this whole aloof / "you're not making any sense" act of yours falls apart at the seams due to no less than your own ego. You can't even hold your act together for more than a few comments before devolving to the same talking points as your cohorts and/or main account, when those you despise and target trigger you into revealing yourself.

                  <p>
                   Look at how you and your cohorts (or brainwashers – slim chance that you're a victim of their narrative rather than a pusher, though, given the particulars) have treated anyone who doesn't buy into the bullshit; organized brigading and harassment/stalking/smear/doxx campaigns.

                         <p>
                          You have accused many of "turning their backs on Jesus Christ"
                         </p>
                         <p>
                          I humbly ask you to look into your own heart.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                          1 Corinthians 2:
                         </p>
                         <p>
                          And I, brethren, when I came to you, came not with excellency of speech or of wisdom, declaring unto you the testimony of God.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                          2 For I determined not to know any thing among you, save Jesus Christ, and him crucified.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                          3 And I was with you in weakness, and in fear, and in much trembling.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                          4 And my speech and my preaching was not with enticing words of man's wisdom, but in demonstration of the Spirit and of power:
                         </p>
                         <p>
                          5 That your faith should not stand in the wisdom of men, but in the power of God.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                          6 Howbeit we speak wisdom among them that are perfect: yet not the wisdom of this world, nor of the princes of this world, that come to nought:
                         </p>
                         <p>
                          7 But we speak the wisdom of God in a mystery, even the hidden wisdom, which God ordained before the world unto our glory:
                         </p>
                         <p>
                          8 Which none of the princes of this world knew: for had they known it, they would not have crucified the Lord of glory.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                          9 But as it is written, Eye hath not seen, nor ear heard, neither have entered into the heart of man, the things which God hath prepared for them that love him.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                          10 But God hath revealed them unto us by his Spirit: for the Spirit searcheth all things, yea, the deep things of God.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                          11 For what man knoweth the things of a man, save the spirit of man which is in him? even so the things of God knoweth no man, but the Spirit of God.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                          12 Now we have received, not the spirit of the world, but the spirit which is of God; that we might know the things that are freely given to us of God.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                          13 Which things also we speak, not in the words which man's wisdom teacheth, but which the Holy Ghost teacheth; comparing spiritual things with spiritual.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                          14 But the natural man receiveth not the things of the Spirit of God: for they are foolishness unto him: neither can he know them, because they are spiritually discerned.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                          15 But he that is spiritual judgeth all things, yet he himself is judged of no man.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                          16 For who hath known the mind of the Lord, that he may instruct him? but we have the mind of Christ.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                          You have aided me, but also accused me. I am just a man. I am fallen.

                           We have never lied to you. Nothing shared has ever been disproven for a reason. Disinformation is not necessary. Trump made The Deal in Racine. He is not your savior. Jesus Christ is.

Not lying moderators who mock and forsake Jesus Christ and The Truth as they watch The World around them be destroyed by Lucifer. They can Share The Truth any time they wish.

                           If nothing else it should be so simple to see how NXIVM and the Knights of Pythias are linked to Racine. This is Anthony Weiner. This is Chuck Schumer. This is Jeff Epstein. This is Harvey Weinstein. You don’t want to know who else is connected. Q knows. Will they tell you?

                          <p>
                           You will Know The Truth when you speak with Jesus Christ directly. Verify anything that has been Shared and it will be obvious.

                           Racine is The Model for the real Agenda and the Mark of the Beast. We have told of The Parousia, and you see what is happening now.

                       That is exactly what they are trying to imply, and would love for people to believe. Accusing people of being somebody's alt is their first, and usually only line of defense when somebody disagrees with them. By doing this they can attempt to cast doubt on people and avoid the details. And argo is just a brain damaged drug head that brags about drinking blood, and believing he is a "dragon" that was put on earth to save the rest of us idiots.

                       Since I'm the only person on Voat who has admitted to reading all of his "research", I can state without reservation, he is full of shit, and doesn't know what he is talking about over 90% of the time.

                         When you unban NOMO (after he agrees to quit being a cantankerous cunt), maybe I'll take your statement that you're "exposing" ES more seriously.

                          There isn't a serious pizzagate researcher on this board who believes Nomo and ES are different, to my knowledge. I didn't get a single complaint when I banned them all, despite putting up a sticky. Not one. Other than from you. I did get a whole bunch of DMs thanking me, though.

                             You always whine for evidence, and yet provide none. We leave you alone, for the most part, because we appreciate what you do for pizzagate. Otherwise we would, well you know....We appreciate what you do for pizzagate so we leave you alone, but that is no excuse for banning people you disagree with, and talking shit.

                             Free speech is a real thing that you abandoned. We could fix that but we leave you alone, again, because pizzagate, and we believe in pizzagate, because we know pizzagate is real, and we fuckin hate pedos.

                               I don't think you're anyone but you. But I also didn't comment in order to "counter my exposure of the latest episode of Sock Puppet Theater." Do you honestly think that birdseyeview is the same as the old birdzeyeview alt, that was assumed to be JA? Or were you just fucking with him? I have a hard time believing you think it's the right thing for you to do, without proof. That's the problem with all the accusations being made. No proof. Vetting you, crunchy,  fagos and SARSie accusations, is like trying to vet one of hojoruku's submissions. Tiring and time consuming. Wasting peoples time on unprovable shit.

                              my observation that you were countering the observation of mine about BirdsEyeView that lead to the thread, to which you then replied that ES and Nomo were different.

                              It's pretty obvious to anyone logical reading down from the top. And I'm not the one they will think is a liar.

                               It's 'kay. It's pretty flattering that they're so desperate to get rid of someone they claim has nothing to offer – so desperate that they've been trying for years to no avail.

                               Also wonderfully amusing. We both know why they can't let it go. They'll throw around ad hominem and contortions, act like it's due to a character flaw or personality clash, pretend I'm not on to something big, etc. The more they protest, though...

               I know who James is but I didn't know he had a username here. Nothing gives. I just noticed that you deleted a thread related to the ELITE Johnson family because you said it didn't pertain to the elite. Then you left these two threads up, one of them yours,

               that do not pertain to the elite. Being the president of a college does not make somebody part of the elite. That is just a random pedo and nothing elite about it.

                That submission falls in the gray area. I left it up, because it shows a pattern of multiple law enforcement agencies cooperating to catch the guy -- basically the inverse of authorities going light on pedos. Pizzagate is the theory that elite pedos have corrupted law enforcement and the justice system to such an extent that pedos can prey on children at will. This guy clearly DID get away with it for a long time. But the article clearly showed those days are over.

                Given the current state of the world, I thought it a good idea to leave some good news on the board.

                           The term "sacrilege" originates from the Latin sacer, meaning sacred, and legere, meaning to steal. In Roman times it referred to the plundering of temples and graves. By the time of Cicero, sacrilege had adopted a more expansive meaning, including verbal offences against religion and undignified treatment of sacred objects.

                          </p>
                          <p>
                           8 For every one that asketh receiveth; and he that seeketh findeth; and to him that knocketh it shall be opened.
                          </p>
                          <p>
                           9 Or what man is there of you, whom if his son ask bread, will he give him a stone?
                          </p>
                          <p>
                           10 Or if he ask a fish, will he give him a serpent?
                          </p>
                          <p>
                           11 If ye then, being evil, know how to give good gifts unto your children, how much more shall your Father which is in heaven give good things to them that ask him?
                          </p>
                          <p>
                           12 Therefore all things whatsoever ye would that men should do to you, do ye even so to them: for this is the law and the prophets.
                          </p>
                          <p>
                           13 Enter ye in at the strait gate: for wide is the gate, and broad is the way, that leadeth to destruction, and many there be which go in thereat:
                          </p>
                          <p>
                           14 Because strait is the gate, and narrow is the way, which leadeth unto life, and few there be that find it.
                          </p>
                          <p>
                           15 Beware of false prophets, which come to you in sheep's clothing, but inwardly they are ravening wolves.
                          </p>
                          <p>
                           16 Ye shall know them by their fruits. Do men gather grapes of thorns, or figs of thistles?
                          </p>
                          <p>
                           17 Even so every good tree bringeth forth good fruit; but a corrupt tree bringeth forth evil fruit.
                          </p>
                          <p>
                           18 A good tree cannot bring forth evil fruit, neither can a corrupt tree bring forth good fruit.
                          </p>
                          <p>
                           19 Every tree that bringeth not forth good fruit is hewn down, and cast into the fire.
                          </p>
                          <p>
                           20 Wherefore by their fruits ye shall know them.
                          </p>
                          <p>
                           21 Not every one that saith unto me, Lord, Lord, shall enter into the kingdom of heaven; but he that doeth the will of my Father which is in heaven.
                          </p>
                          <p>
                           22 Many will say to me in that day, Lord, Lord, have we not prophesied in thy name? and in thy name have cast out devils? and in thy name done many wonderful works?
                          </p>
                          <p>
                           23 And then will I profess unto them, I never knew you: depart from me, ye that work iniquity.
                          </p>
                          <p>
                           24 Therefore whosoever heareth these sayings of mine, and doeth them, I will liken him unto a wise man, which built his house upon a rock:
                          </p>
                          <p>
                           25 And the rain descended, and the floods came, and the winds blew, and beat upon that house; and it fell not: for it was founded upon a rock.
                          </p>
                          <p>
                           26 And every one that heareth these sayings of mine, and doeth them not, shall be likened unto a foolish man, which built his house upon the sand:
                          </p>
                          <p>
                           27 And the rain descended, and the floods came, and the winds blew, and beat upon that house; and it fell: and great was the fall of it.
                          </p>
                          <p>
                           28 And it came to pass, when Jesus had ended these sayings, the people were astonished at his doctrine:
                          </p>
                          <p>
                           29 For he taught them as one having authority, and not as the scribes.

If your eye causes you to stumble, pluck it out and throw it from you. It is better for you to enter life with one eye, than to have two eyes and be cast into the fiery hell. See that you do not despise one of these little ones, for I say to you that their angels in heaven continually see the face of My Father who is in heaven."

                            <p>
                             1 Peter 3: 8-22

                             8 Finally, be ye all of one mind, having compassion one of another, love as brethren, be pitiful, be courteous:
                            </p>
                            <p>
                             9 Not rendering evil for evil, or railing for railing: but contrariwise blessing; knowing that ye are thereunto called, that ye should inherit a blessing.

                            <p>
                             10 For he that will love life, and see good days, let him refrain his tongue from evil, and his lips that they speak no guile:
                            </p>
                            <p>
                             11 Let him eschew evil, and do good; let him seek peace, and ensue it.

                            <p>
                             12 For the eyes of the Lord are over the righteous, and his ears are open unto their prayers: but the face of the Lord is against them that do evil.
                            </p>
                            <p>

                             18 For Christ also hath once suffered for sins, the just for the unjust, that he might bring us to God, being put to death in the flesh, but quickened by the Spirit:

                            <p>
                             20 Which sometime were disobedient, when once the longsuffering of God waited in the days of Noah, while the ark was a preparing, wherein few, that is, eight souls were saved by water.

                             21 The like figure whereunto even baptism doth also now save us (not the putting away of the filth of the flesh, but the answer of a good conscience toward God,) by the resurrection of Jesus Christ:

              The galactic center of the Milky Way passes directly over Southern Wisconsin, which is where Racine is. This means the Luciferian satanists cannot abandon this area, which means they are vulnerable and can be defeated here. If enough people knew about the corruption in Racine, it would paralyze them. They could not precipitate a crisis because all of the people whose lives they destroyed could band together and force them out of Racine.

             Project Zyphr is a plot to unleash a pandemic, followed by large scale power outages, which will be used as a cover to round up and execute millions of Americans that the cabal perceives as a threat. Everyone needs to watch this:

             Can you please give us advice on how to survive Project Zyphr? Surely many of the posters on this forum are scheduled to be rounded up. Can you tell us WHO is going to be rounding us up? Will it be official law enforcement or will it be some shadowy group? If we fight back and somehow survive, will we be charged with crimes? Please tell us what we can do to survive. Do we all need to flee our houses and go into hiding RIGHT NOW?

             Project Zyphr certainly looks like it's happening now. You have also said many times that "The Parousia", (which is a greek word for "second coming" but it can potentially refer to the coming of the anti-christ) is happening now.

               There are two, I think. There is a Beast from the sea and a Beast from the Earth. John saw the Beast from the Sea "rise up out of the sea, having seven heads and ten horns, and upon his horns ten crowns, and upon his heads the name of blasphemy." It was like a leopard, with feet like the feet of a bear, and had a mouth like a lion. One of its heads had a mortal wound which healed itself, causing people to wonder at it and follow it.

                This description draws many parallels with a vision in the Book of Daniel where four beasts symbolizing a succession of kingdoms come out of the sea in the forms of a lion, bear, leopard and a beast with ten horns.

               The one thing that I did notice is that the Statue of Liberty wears a crown with ten horns. What does it mean to "come out of the sea"? Is this a metaphor for empires that dominate through Naval power?

               He promised that he would return. You have said many times George Webb claimed to have met Jesus in Racine. Is that actually true or just something he said (I don't trust George Webb)? Is Jesus in Racine right now?

                According to Walter Veith, if I remember it correctly, this refers to the Vatican as the beast and the seven heads are seven nations. He has a couple of different video series and then a bunch of random videos. Walter is an amazing scholar and has a very interesting background. The video I am referring to might be the "a woman rides the beast" in the video title but I can't remember. I learned a lot from Walter.

                 I have not read the Book of Matthew before. I was not a Christian before talking to you, but now I think I am, because you are the only one who I have never heard say anything false.

                <p>
                 From what I read just now, I believe God was seen in the cloud and he said "This is my beloved Son, with whom I am well pleased; listen to him."

                <p>
                 However, when I read this one thing does stand out. It says repeatedly many things like this: "But of that day and hour no one knows, not even the angels of heaven, nor the Son, but the Father only."

                 I am not sure what QAnon "is" but I know he was created in response to SenateAnon, and to give false hope to pizzagaters and trump supporters that the cabal would be taken down. It would also be logical to suspect that QAnon may be part of Project Pogo as well.

                 Founded in 1968 at Accademia dei Lincei in Rome, Italy, the Club of Rome consists of current and former heads of state, UN bureaucrats, high-level politicians and government officials, diplomats, scientists, economists, and business leaders from around the globe.[1] It stimulated considerable public attention in 1972 with the first report to the Club of Rome, The Limits to Growth. The Limits to Growth is a 1972 report on the computer simulation of exponential economic and population growth with a finite supply of resources.

                 After reviewing their computer simulations, the research team came to the following conclusions:

                 <p>
                  Given business as usual, i.e., no changes to historical growth trends, the limits to growth on earth would become evident by 2072, leading to "sudden and uncontrollable decline in both population and industrial capacity". This includes the following:
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  Global Industrial output per capita reaches a peak around 2008, followed by a rapid decline

                 <p>
                  Global Services per capita reaches a peak around 2020, followed by a rapid decline

                  Why is water a key element to The Deal made by Trump in Racine?

                <p>
                 I wish I knew the answer to this, but water appears to have many special properties. It is claimed that it can facilitate remote viewing, and is supposedly the secret to "zero point energy" and "flying saucers". It also has a "memory" and it has quantum properties as well.
                </p>
                <p>
                 One thing I have noticed is that the vast majority of burial mound in the state of Wisconsin are next to a source of water, at least according to this map:

                <p>
                 Here is a theory: Are they building a quantum computer at the Foxconn plant that somehow will interact with the Mark of the Beast? Is such a quantum computer necessary to keep track of all of the different unique ID's that a person can create for themselves under the ID2020 plan?
                </p>
                <p>
                 The Foxconn plant requires an insane amount of water. I think it was something like 7 million gallons per day, which is another reason why Racine and the Great Lakes are so important.

                 I am not sure why Racine itself is the Bellwether that predicts national elections, but Wisconsin might be the most well known swing state. According to this article which looked at elections since 1840, Racine County, WI might be the single best bellwether: if it called all the elections with missing data elections correctly, it would have 86% correct.

                Those guys are really sick. The likeness of Chester to John is uncanny. There was also a tweet from him to John wishing him a Happy. Bday. I saw it posted on voat the night we found out about his death. When I looked later it was gone and completely scrubbed. Johns Bday is Jan. 8.

                Dahmer was in the army. I read an article about the guy that killed him in jail. And why.

            WTH is going on in that state? I think this stuff has been escalating all over because of the music genre and Goth dressing etc. But C’mon. Lock up these people before they kill someone.

              a billion dollars given to racine schools over 30 years? since this ends in 2050, does this have anything to do with Agenda 2050? racine seems to just throw money around, and if the foxconn plant is any indicator, they don't always spend the money on what they say they are spending it on. The money is ostensibly going to be used for construction of new schools and modernization of existing school. They are constructing a "Starbucks international baccalaureate k-8". I think the IB program is for really smart kids. is this going to bring a bunch of international kids to racine? their fact sheet says they are going to "Expand Starbuck to create a K-8 International Baccalaureate campus."
             </p>
             <p>
              The existing "Starbuck middle school" in Racine appears to have extremely low ratings. It received a rating of 1/10 on test scores, student progress, equity overview and low income students, and it also has a red flag over the "discipline and attendance" category. no other categories appear to be rated.

              The test scores section is unbelievable. 7% proficiency in English whereas the state average is 42%, 5% proficiency in math vs a 41% state average, 15% proficiency in science vs 50% state average and 18% proficiency in social studies vs a 53% state average. This is an IB program!? I thought IB programs were elite programs for the highest achieving students?
             </p>
             <p>
              The discipline problem is out of this world too. 18% of the student body gets suspended? 36% of black students get suspended (the majority of the student body - 37% - is black) and a whopping 42% of students with a multi ethnic background got suspended (vs a 9% state average for this category). 48% of students with disabilities get suspended vs a 9% state average. Is there ANY teaching going on at this place at all?
             </p>
             <p>
              It says low income kids are generally being left behind at this school, and 74% of the student body is low income.
             </p>
             <p>
              All of this in spite of an
              <strong>
               extremely
              </strong>
              low student:teacher ratio of 13 to 1. Although the state average is only 14:1, but where I came from a 13:1 student to teacher ratio would be considered extremely low.

              This is or was an "anti" human trafficking project aimed at bringing awareness to human trafficking along the I-94 freeway.

              It's some kind of quantum supercomputer or quantum internet being built right now at the Foxconn plant in Racine. I'm not sure how it connects to any of this, aside from the fact that it could potentially be used for mind control purposes, and that Starbuck school certainly looks like some kind of MK Ultra nonsense is going on there.

                Based on the description they give of themselves, I can't really tell what they do. Their websites use a lot of words but don't say a whole lot. They do things like "provide coaching and technical support to help teams identify, measure and evaluate tangible practices to guide local community improvement and inspire countywide scaling."
               </p>
               <p>
                But the inverse of this, Career to Cradle, is something that appears unique to Jeff Neubauers organization, Higher Expectations for Racine County.

               <p>
                It's just as vague, claiming "While many communities work from cradle to career, our work begins with the end in mind: a fully capable and employed Racine County workforce. To achieve this vision, we work backwards – from career to cradle – to ensure Racine County youth are prepared for success in life." Should I view vague language like this, that uses a lot of words to say nothing concrete, as a red flag?

                 The international particle accelerator collaboration CERN announced Monday, June 4, that two experiments at the Large Hadron Collider discovered a link between the two heaviest known particles: the top quark and the Higgs boson.
                </p>
                <p>
                 University of Wisconsin–Madison physicists are members of the CMS and ATLAS experiments at CERN, which jointly discovered the Higgs boson in 2012. The same two experiments have now seen simultaneous production of both the Higgs boson and the top quark during a rare subatomic process.
                </p>
                <p>
                 This is the first time scientists have measured the Higgs boson’s direct interaction with top quarks. Studying these particles gives clues about the nature of matter and mass in the universe.

                A quantum computer could enable all sorts of things. I can only speculate what it could enable. Steinbart claims it can enable communication across time, which seems pretty hard to believe, but maybe it's true. I have no clue what this has to do with the other 7 wonders. I'm not actually sure which list of wonders you are talking about, either. Do you mean the Ancient Wonders, or the Natural Wonders?

                   On December 23, 1947, a Tuesday, Mrs. Helen Miller, proud as a peacock, raised up her skirt and revealed for the eager readers of the Los Angeles Herald Express that she had been held captive for eight days and was the

                   Why was she captive? What do the symbols on her thigh mean? How did she escape? Local News is cruel that way; slim, enticing phrases here and there explain these lurid, macabre images. But soon enough even the need for explanatory text vanishes as these lost souls and suspects speak for themselves and become complicit as we read heavily into their circumstances.

                  The only thing I can find on a Donald Graef search is this report from the department of agriculture circa 1970 which, on page 772, says that a Donald Graef, as well as a Carl Graef, who live in Osborn, Missouri, received a payment of about $5,000:

                  Since I can't find anything on Graef, I looked up the family name:

                  They were an influential family who helped develop Switzerland. You said the Dutch East India company was heavily involved, and Cornelius de Graef and Andries de Graef were both Mayors of Amsterdam at one point. Is it possible that the person who kidnapped Helen Miller and who was interviewed for the murder of the Black Dahlia is related to the Mayors of Amsterdam during the 1600's? Finally, I noticed an alternative spelling of Graef is Graffin. That reminds me of Greg Graffin, the lead singer of a semi-well known anti-religion rock band called Bad Religion, who is from Racine, Wisconsin and got his PHD in Zoology from Cornell University:

                  You said "Racine is the model, New York and California follow". Greg Graffin was extremely influential in the 1990's southern california skate punk scene. Is there any connection between Greg Graffin and the person who kidnapped Helen Miller for 8 days?

                  This may be a stretch, but is there anything to the circular depiction of the columns in this labyrinth? They remind me of both the shape of a quantum computer and the shape of the large hadron collider, and both of those kind of remind me of Shaumbergers vortex.

                  The Sphinx Head Society is the oldest senior honor society at Cornell University. In 1929 The New York Times held that election into Sphinx Head and similar societies constituted "the highest non-scholastic honor within reach of undergraduates."

                  Two members whose names stand out:

                  Oscar G. Mayer, Jr. - Moved the headquarters of his company to Wisconsin.

                  Samuel Curtis Johnson Jr. - Born and Died in Racine Wisconsin. His wife Imogene Powers Johnson founded The Prairie School in Wind Point, Wisconsin where Kristin Bauer van Straten went to school.

                  It would not surprise me if those two individuals were involved somehow in controlling global food supply. I will try to answer more of your questions later but I don't want this reply to get too convoluted.
