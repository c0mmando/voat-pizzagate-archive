Dozens of pages of e-mails and other documents obtained by The New Yorker reveal that, although Epstein was listed as “disqualified” in M.I.T.’s official donor database, the Media Lab continued to accept gifts from him, consulted him about the use of the funds, and, by marking his contributions as anonymous, avoided disclosing their full extent, both publicly and within the university. Perhaps most notably, Epstein appeared to serve as an intermediary between the lab and other wealthy donors, soliciting millions of dollars in donations from individuals and organizations, including the technologist and philanthropist Bill Gates and the investor Leon Black. According to the records obtained by The New Yorker and accounts from current and former faculty and staff of the media lab, Epstein was credited with securing at least $7.5 million in donations for the lab, including two million dollars from Gates and $5.5 million from Black, gifts the e-mails describe as “directed” by Epstein or made at his behest. The effort to conceal the lab’s contact with Epstein was so widely known that some staff in the office of the lab’s director, Joi Ito, referred to Epstein as Voldemort or “he who must not be named.”</em></p>

            Medscape Interview with MIT Media Lab scientist Dr. Boyden- funded by Bill Gates to study human brain.   Boyden studied/ experimented with?on ? ITO, who had no formal college degrees, but had a spark of entrepreneurship.  Reminds us of Epstein, right?  No degree.
           </p>
           <p>
            From the interview :
           </p>
           <p>
            “  Can we find—and facilitate—ideas that are misfits, people who don't quite fit in, or projects that can change the world but might seem a little bit wacky?
           </p>
           <p>
            “Dr Topol: Joi Ito, the head of the MIT Media Lab, does not have any [formal] education, is that right?
           </p>
           <p>
            "You're going to take a graduate student who didn't finish college?"
           </p>
           <p>
            Dr Topol: Exactly. He's a good model.
           </p>
           <p>
            Dr Boyden: He did okay, right?
           </p>
           <p>
            Dr Topol: I want to finish up with the BRAIN Initiative. There's worldwide interest that this precious organ has been understudied and is poorly understood. We have new tools, especially optogenetics, and this is getting a lot of funding from the National Institutes of Health. Where do you think the global and US BRAIN Initiative will go? Obviously, you're going to be a significant part of that.”
           </p>
           <p>
            Boyden did undergrad at Stanford.  Home of liar psycho Kavanaugh accuser Blasey Ford.

            In the article it mentions Sihanoukville, which is where my ex wife had an orphanage named Books With No Borders(as opposed to Books Without Borders and when we looked into it it was all very fishy. I mentioned it in a radio interview and the next day it was scrubbed from the internet. The orphanage even named one of the buildings Florence House (after her).  What a joke. That was around 2011. Turns out that area of Cambodia was completely contaminated with child trafficking and was considered(at that time) the number 1 place in the world for child trafficking.

            correct Chomsky, Deutch and the chabad mafia of zio fame aka Stevie Pieceznik runs MIT as a pedo blackmail intel breeding ground for crooks, scams, and pure damn evil....its also a focal point of Soviet Israel penetration aka the Tel Aviv Moscow New York axis of the kosher nostra which literally does the nastiest shit and no one gets truly punished ever....gain power, maintain power, grow power, and exploit...hence Bibi saying you can take a soviet math and science goon and stick them in Palo Alto and get things done with "market forces" aka stock channel flow and proliferation....Wexner is such trash the whole WJC is a pile of child raping cnuff film passing around jerkoffs schizing while their fellow rebbes in israel openly defense pedophile blackmail ops as they did in the early 2000's saying sexual blackmail for the security of the Israeli state is a "holy act"

              MAR 23rd Protest Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed Bin Salman at MIT
             </p>
             <p>
              The Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia – a country that has been responsible for the bombing of Yemen and its humanitarian crisis, the worldwide diffusion of a virulent form of Wahhabi Sunni Islam, the arming of rebels in various countries, and human rights violations in its own country – will be visiting MIT between March 24 and 26. We call on all those who oppose militarism, war, and extremism to urge MIT to cancel this visit. If MIT doesn’t meet this demand, we call on you to to oppose this visit with us by protesting at MIT.

             <p>
              Mohammed bin Salman, the crown prince of Saudi Arabia, visited MIT Saturday as one of the stops on his first official tour of the U.S.
             </p>
             <p>
              “His Royal Highness Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman’s visit today in Greater Boston focused on nurturing ties between the private sector and academia of the two nations,” according to a press release by the Royal Embassy of Saudi Arabia’s Information Office.
             </p>
             <p>
              The prince’s visit was in conjunction with the second annual Innovation to Impact forum, which was held at the Samberg Center in E52 Saturday morning as part of an “ongoing collaboration” between MIT and several Saudi Arabian entities, specifically King Abdulaziz City for Science and Technology, King Abdullah University of Science and Technology (KAUST), and the General Authority of Small and Medium Enterprises.
             </p>
             <p>
              “Saudi Arabia and MIT have a longstanding collaborative relationship focused on subjects of mutual interest,” Kimberly Allen, director of media relations and deputy director of MIT News, wrote in an email to The Tech.
             </p>
             <p>
              This includes “creating opportunities for post-doctoral Saudi women scientists and engineers to study at MIT” and “supporting the development of sustainable energy,” Allen continued. “Saudi Aramco is a founding member of the MIT Energy Initiative.”
             </p>
             <p>
              Leaders at the forum included MIT President L. Rafael Reif and Saudi Minister of Energy, Industry, and Mineral Resources Khalid Al-Falih. Collaborative agreements on various research initiatives, such as those Allen listed, were signed by the participants and “inaugurated by the Crown Prince,” according to the press release.
             </p>
             <p>
              The Saudi Embassy also tweeted that the prince toured an innovation exhibition at MIT that showcased “selected industrial innovations produced by several Saudi companies and universities.”
             </p>
             <p>
              Aside from limited official publicity, secrecy and rigid security have surrounded Mohammed’s visit, which took place at the Media Lab shortly after the forum.
             </p>
             <p>
              Allen wrote in her email that “when circumstances indicated the Crown Prince's desire to visit MIT” during his time in Greater Boston, “MIT agreed to host him.”

             It was a Saturday and the visit was not generally announced. Hard to miss the black SUVs and snipers on the roof of the former Senior House though.

            Joi Ito now also stepped back from the NYT board. Makes you wonder what he was doing there in the first place - editor of the NYT is Mark Thompson, former head of the BBC. He covered the Savile pedophilia scandal up at the time.
           </p>
           <p>
            Birds of a feather....
           </p>
           <p>
            Also, it turned out that Ito hasn't got a college degree. Like Epstein, who was hired as a teacher at the elite Dalton school nevertheless.
           </p>
           <p>
            Question: Could Ito be a CIA asset, like Epstein?

             Men are pitched against women, blacks against white, “left” against “right”, rich against the poor etc. etc. Sidenote: check the history and origin of the term Ideology ! Hate is incited, war is made palatable again, to a generation living in peace which never knew about its horrors. Creeds are used to controll and to dehumanize believers of different creeds or nowadays even just different opinions.

              Yes, because they run child rape and trafficking ring for blackmailing politicians. Like Trump's mentor Roy Cohn did before Epstein.

            Epstein and his likes, yes there are many of his type, delivered the kids for making porn, MIT was/is operating deepweb child porn sites and made sure the material was stored safely, sold and distributed. Aaron cloned the MIT servers and discovered what they were hiding. They killed him for sure.
           </p>
           <p>
            MIT creates black money for the USA’s black projects. Again this is only based on my opinion.

              I disagree..........Shimatsu is very biased against liberals, but what else is new? Current propaganda is liberals are responsible for all the world's wrongs. He has sources that are at the top.

            ..Further on, this essay will examine the occult Shabbatean roots of the Greek Jewish Negroponte family from Calchika, the Venetian fortress of Negroponte on the Aegean island of Euboea (Evvia) where their pimping Khazarian Jew ancestors flourished in the service of the Doge of Venice and the Ottoman court, as continued into our present era in Ambassador John Negroponte’s relishing of the perverse sadistic torture at Abu Graibh Prison in military-occupied Iraq. The elite’s sex crimes against defenseless children are legacy operations of cults that operate in secret like vampire covens in Eastern Europe and Turkey as depicted in the “Underworld” series and the Dracula movies. ...
           </p>
           <p>
            ..The complicity of DARPA and the National Science Foundation in this campaign of misdirection under a blanket cover-up is yet to be exposed...
           </p>
           <p>
            ..Joichi Ito’s academic biography is noteworthy for its lack of mention of graduation from any university, not even with a bachelor’s degree, having been a dropout from Tufts and the University of Chicago. One of his disappointed teachers said that Joi believed himself to be too “creative” but actually was too lazy and undisciplined to attend class. His curriculum vita is otherwise packed with honorary mentions and highfalutin titles, obviously exchanged for generous donations by this fraudster. Institutional bribery bought his ticket to ride.
           </p>
           <h1 id="md-psy-op-tokyo">
            PSY op Tokyo
           </h1>
           <p>
            His “big start” in tech came with development of the PSY network in Tokyo, thanks to a little help from Cable and Wireless PLC, a private-sector telecom that fronted for the British CGHQ spy agency (equivalent to the NSA) operating out of Hong Kong and Australia. The Brit intel connection also links the Negroponte brothers to UK Princes Charles and Philip, those descendants of the King of Greece, a Brit-installed puppet during the Greek independence struggle against the Ottoman Turks in which Lord Byron figured so publicly. Is the MIT Media Lab actually a British intelligence outpost in the Ivy League? What else can explain Joi Ito’ mercurial rise based on nothing but hot air?
           </p>
           <p>
            ..The Japanese yakuza-owned studios were the world’s leading producer of child rape and S&amp;M videos, available in uncensored format only for export. The underground trade and file-sharing over the Internet at his PSY operation (TWICS would have detected massive online porn) should explain how Joi Ito endeared himself to the high-end pedophile studio known as the MIT Media Lab. In that early era of the Internet, videos were too large for file-transfer and so shipments by
            <strong>
             TNT
            </strong>
            overnight air-express (the American founder of TNT was a serial rapist of underage Filipina girls). Ah, yes, those golden days of underage rape across Asia from Japan to Thailand.
           </p>
           <p>
            Back to the Joi boy, the socially approved innocent who was appointed at Harvard Law as a “professor at Practice” (whatever that means): “Ito is chairman of the board of PureTech Health and serves on several other boards, including The New York Times Company, the MacArthur Foundation and the Knight Foundation.
            <strong>
             He is also the former chairman and CEO of Creative Commons, and a former board member of ICANN, The Open Source Initiative, and The Mozilla Foundation.
            </strong>
            Ito is a serial entrepreneur who helped start and run numerous companies including one of the first web companies in Japan, Digital Garage, and the first commercial Internet service provider in Japan, PSINet Japan/IIKK. He has been an early-stage investor in many companies, including Formlabs, Flickr, Kickstarter, littleBits, and Twitter. He has received a lifetime achievement award from Oxford Internet Institute” Impressive for a college dropout.” Blah-blah-blah. Show us the credentials.
           </p>
           <p>
            ..Therefore with the connections to Operation Paperclip, which morphed into DARPA, Joi Ito grew up as one of the Pentagon brats just like Jeff Bezos, the favorite boy of his maternal grandfather Lawrence Preston Gise, a founder of NASA and DARPA, as disclosed in one of my earlier articles for rense.com. It’s called nepotism, folks, based on “family secrets” reinforced by incest. These hand-me-down “geniuses” are mere managers and secret-protectors, not bright lights. Another one of these Jewish family heirlooms is Alexandra Ocasio-Cortez, the NASA-awarded “science genius” with a thick Yiddish accent, whose “uncle” with the Kirshenbaum clan at Mount Sinai hospital’s research center facilitated her research on a microscopic worm.
           </p>
           <p>
            ..George Church, molecular biologist specializing in genetic editing, CRISPR, was co-initiator of the BRAIN project launched by President Barack Obama, which is (face it, folks) a continuation of MK-ULTRA, using plug-in chips to fine-tune cognition after the initial experiments by those pioneering Doctors Sydney Gottlieb with LSD studies and Ewan Cameron through electro-shock therapy produced such excellent results in the assignments for Mark David Chapman and Whitey Bulger.
           </p>
           <p>
            An innovator of chip-DNA synthesis, Professor Church has been the director of research projects at the Department of Energy (DOE), National Institutes of Health (NIH, genomics) and the Wyss Institute of Synthetic Biology. For those who recall my Pizzagate series, Hansjorg Weiss is the Swiss philanthropist who ran Synthes, a producer of prosthetics, implants and biomaterials, which was hit with medical malpractice suits for illegal experiments that killed several patients. Wyss was a friend and associate of John Podesta until he was scared off by the risk of blackmail following sexual performances at private showings. Herr Doktor Victor Frankenstein, where are you now that we need you?
           </p>
           <p>
            ..In contemporary history, the Negroponte family’s most prominent members are the brother Nicholas with the MIT Media Lab and John, the former neoconservative UN Ambassador for George W. Bush. By no coincidence, the Podesta family, headed by John and Tony of Pizzagate fame are also long ago Venetian Jews, whose surname derives from “pedestal”, the corrupt concierges in charge of audiences with the Doge (ruler) of Venice. That city, being allied with the Eastern Roman Empire rather than Rome, was a center of barbaric sorcery and witchcraft, as implied by the custom of wearing masks to disguise one’s going to places of illicit activity, run by the Khazarian Jews, a black tradition kept up by the Negroponte brothers.
