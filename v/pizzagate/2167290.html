            I'd like to see a verified time of death for Stephen Paddock. He was dead already when SWAT breached the room on the 32nd floor. There was an accidental firearm discharge during the response, not sure what that was about either. On top of that there were flashes from floor 3 or 4, did the police search every floor? Were the flashes identified? Was someone taking flash photography from the lower floors? I heard that there was a small child alone in a nearby room on the 32nd floor, and that it took hours after the shooting stopped for the parents to get the kid back. Earlier two people were bounced from the concert because they were yelling that everyone is going to die tonight.
           </p>

            Paddock, or someone that looked similar, was at a Trump protest wearing pink NASA stuff.
