I couldn\'t believe my eyes when I read the instructions on how to TRAIN a child in the womb
The FRIGGING womb!!!
And then I had this thought is that why they have this anomaly? Trauma is one of the causes for it 
Causes
Coloboma can occur due to:
Eye surgery
Inherited conditions
Trauma to the eye
Most cases of coloboma have no known cause and are not related to other abnormalities. A small percentage of people with coloboma have other inherited developmental problems.

            Thanks, it seems to be a continuation of their original book I posted about here -

            It is claimed that modern mind control programs like MONARCH stemmed from the work of nazi scientists like joseph mengele who we know for a fact was obsessed with genetics and experimentation on humans. These mind control research programs continued in the USA under Operation Paperclip which lead to the CIA program MKULTRA which "failed"  (who in their right mind would think that the CIA would admit if it was a successful program) and was further funded by black budget to produce MONARCH and other mind control programs.
           </p>
           <p>
            We know how sensitive a childs mind is and that problems in this stage of life can manifest later on so it is not a stretch to assume that some sick fucks ran thousands of tests on children to find the best methods and times in development to break their mind and lead to the development of their personalized mind control program.

            TRAINING THE UNBORN CHILD
           </p>
           <p>
            Pretty interesting read.
           </p>
           <p>
            -Interestingly, Veiny studied research into the mind of the fetus from researchers at the Max Plank Institute, Munich, Germany, from the Esalen Institute, Big Sur, CA., from the Center for Research on Birth and Human Development, Berkeley, CA which are all institutions involved in mind-control and mind-control research. Just one example of the learning abilities of the unborn child, an autistic child remembered the english her French speaking mother was around during work while the child was in the womb.
           </p>
           <p>
            Veiny writes, "The fetus can see, hear, experience, taste and, on a primitive level, even learn in utero (that is, in the uterus--before birth). Most importantly, he can feel--not with an adult’s sophistication, but feel nonetheless." (p. 12) Research has clearly showed that the fetus can think and is shaping its (his or her) personality while in the womb. Maternal thoughts, feelings, actions, and fears all reach the child in the womb and affect the child. The maternal bonding with the child while in the womb is also critical.

             Stop trolling . I didn't know they train unborn children, so it shocked me. And I for one am convinced that Madeline McCann's parents were in on whatever happened to her. Don't waltz I. Here and call me names please.

            Certainly possible but not enough to draw solid conclusions from.  Without more evidence, all we can do is speculate.  Kate and Gerry mcCANN (CAIN) certainly aren't going to tell us.

            I posted that first link.  Springmeier paid heavily for revealing what he did and was shipped off to federal prison on bogus charges.
           </p>
           <p>
            Coloboma is also associated with a host of genetic and chromosomal anomalies.  I wish they were forthcoming on Maddie's medical history.

             please learn not to take the bait from ShariaBlue..they think we are idiots and would reasonably debate this kind of horse shit.  They have grown a lot more sophisticated from round 1 of CTR back in Nov.  Now they are much more careful to make posts that seem reasonable and lead good researchers into rabbit holes or create straw man arguments that can be shot down by the MSM.

              So, you're saying that the OP, Jakestr, is "ShariaBlue" of CTR?  I am new here, do not know "Jakestr" or "ShariaBlue."  I DO know that they copied the link that
              <em>
               I
              </em>
              posted on another thread.
             </p>
             <p>
              It is a LEGITIMATE subject for discussion, not horseshit or a strawman argument.  (Actually, this isn't an argument at all.  Shows how much you know about debate.)  Stop being an asshole by downvoating me because YOU have issues with "ShariaBlue."
