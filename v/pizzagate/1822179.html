<p>The funny thing is that I was a rabid liberal back then. Yes, was a little brainwashed myself. And the effect was that I stopped watching South Park for a while because it held to a different political perspective.

It\'s the insidious side of controlling minds, and something the liberal camp excels at. </p>
<p>If anyone can find the complete link of the Super Adventurers Club explanation of why having sex with kids, it would be great. Just wanted to get this out there so it\'s not overlooked.</p>',

              Look at Brad Pitt's bio kids and will smith's kids, they have the gender confusion on steroids. Charlize Theron's adopted African son dresses like a girl down to high heels and blonde wigs, no joke. Beyoncé I think might be pregnant with twins, that's going to be interesting as if anyone is mkultra'd its her. Anyone else glad to be a middle class nobody, because I sure am. 0.o

               Yes, it's great being a nobody, isn't it? I thank God each and every day. I never was one for sex rituals. By its definition, it requires me getting off the couch, and that ain't gonna fly.
              </p>
              <p>
               The thing is with these "gender confused" children is the pandering to this notion. With Branjolina's kid, she was only three when they announced her confusion. A three-year-old driving the bus? A three-year-old by definition is confused about life. Therefore, they shouldn't be given imponderables or asked their opinion on life, love, and what sex they want to be when they grow up. If I was given the choice, I would have wanted to be a wolf, and if I was unfortunate enough to be a part of the Pedo/RapeyWood crowd, they would have nurtured that by letting me continue to crawl on all fours and emit howls instead of learning to speak. Does that sound productive to you? Me neither.
              </p>
              <p>
               It's ironic how we (and I'm speaking for a lot of us) thought that these third world country adoption kids were so fortunate to have been adopted by celebrities. In fact, the went from a horrible situation into an even worse one. Something really needs to be done and if Trump isn't going to do it, I don't know who will.

              He is also planning a mass showing of the supression of free energy. The world will change as we know it. Wouldn't be surprised if he suicides himself of has a heart attack soon.

               Snowden did no such thing. In making a point about encryption, he quipped for a minute to Neil deGrasse Tyson that if advanced aliens were sending out radio signals, we probably wouldn't be able to decrypt them.
               <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2015/09/21/aliens-could-be-trying-to-contacts-us-claims-edward-snowden_n_8168826.html">
                Read this
               </a>
               :
              </p>
              <blockquote>
               <p>
                Edward Snowden’s views on communication have taken an extraterrestrial turn after he told Neil deGrasse Tyson how aliens could be talking about humans in an encrypted language.
               </p>
               <p>
                Halfway through the hour-long chat, Tyson asked the NSA whistleblower how would aliens want to communicate with us.
               </p>
               <p>
                And in Snowden’s opinion, the answer boils down to ET signals being encrypted and therefore, harder to understand.
               </p>
               <p>
                “If you had an alien civilisation trying to listen to other civilisations or our civilisations trying to listen to aliens, there’s only one small period in the development of their society when all of their communications will be sent via the most primitive and most unprotected means.
               </p>
               <p>
                “When we think about everything that we are hearing through our satellites or everything they are hearing from our civilisation, if indeed there are aliens out there, all of their communications are encrypted by default.
               </p>
               <p>
                “So what we are hearing that’s actually a television show...or a phone call or their planets and their own GPS constellation is indistinguishable to us from cosmic background microwave radiation.”
               </p>
              </blockquote>

               Greer is pretty suspect too.  I think he's on somebody's payroll.

               Well, TPTB scammed people before with this alien stuff. Believe it was in the 50s that someone gained entrance into the White House by touting he was an alien. Gore Vidal wrote a play about it.

             except that like any demographic there are jews on both sides of the political spectrum, and probably most jews would be horrified by the truths; the abuse and corruption revealed here. One of the most important aspects of investigating is to understand that the political parties are simply constructions to keep us divided.

            Was one of the researchers that posted on Scientology early on. It was discovered that L. Ron Hubbard estate was connected to the Alefantis properties as well as properties belonging to "moonies" founders. They are the cult linked to the President of South Korea who was thrown out of office in December for Satanic worship. Pictures were even provided with B. Bush.
           </p>
           <p>
            Hubbard &amp; Scientology is known to be linked with CIA operations. Scientology is used as a known blackmail operation used to keep Hollywood in check. Actress Leah Remini has spoken about this at length and almost lost everything. She even explained the process of brainwashing that young children are subjected to.
           </p>
           <p>
            David Miscaivage who became the new leader was sued in court and in the Podesta emails referencing Justice Scalia's death and replacement the name of the attorney that represented D. Miscaivich was proferred.
           </p>
           <p>
            If you do not think this is strange I believe this was mentioned prior to Scalia being dead which would have been last February. The attorney was a "republican" out of Texas.
           </p>
           <p>
            T. Cruise was originally married to N. Kidman. Her father Dr. Anthony Kidman was a psychologist in Australia who was outed by Fiona Bartlett &amp; many others last year for child rape, MK Ultra Ritual Abuse, child hunting parties. Dr. Kidman worked for &amp; with the CIA. He disappeared within a month of the formal charges to Singapore &amp; happened to have a "heart attack" in his hotel. Hollywood exhaustively covered it up.
           </p>
           <p>
            Hubbard used Dianetics as a brainwashing/blackmail tool. How much he believed who knows? The point is best made by Leah Remini who has openly told the world that it is nothing more than psychological mind control &amp; forced confession of your every inner thought into recordings of a handler. To rise up in the power structure in Hollywood and get the top roles you have to keep cleansing your mind. Turning back is not an option. They are taught to "shun" anyone who leaves including family. Threats are used to silence. Prior confessions will be used against you to ruin your life.

             Yes, they do. And what you're saying is what Angelina Jolie confessed in that video that was scrubbed. Why do I get that there is one central power behind all of the tentacles of the puppet master? In the South Park video, you'll see that they're talking about this Adventurer's Club, but there's a kid with the Freemason compass on his vest. I'm thinking it has to do with this hidden god. People mention Baphomet, but the name of the Freemason's is not that. I'm so short of time these days, that I only have time to post quickie posts like this, but I would like to get into the hidden god some day. Maybe I'll surf around and try to see if I can tie it into pizzagate.

              The image that is used is baphomet. The puppet master himself is Lucifer (enlightened one) many will not believe this. Most are not aware. Few reach the top level. To see a well orchestrated perspective of this watch The Outer Dark Youtube channel. Particularly on the Goddard Tunnel opening that just occurred last summer attended by world leaders. Baphomet literally arrives after a catacliclismic event.

               You misunderstand. The god the Freemasons worship is not called Baphomet.

                 Got you. Yeah, I watched a bit of Super Good Friends. I swear the one character looking for Mr. Hat looked exactly like John Podesta. No jjoke. I hope that's the right episode I'm giving. I looked at a few this morning.

            I have entire DVD collection and I know every episode by heart and I did find Adventurer's Club rather revealing, along with NAMBLA episode and Hot Catholic Love. Mat Stone &amp; Trey Parker sure know what's going on!

              They all know, even Megyn Kelly, they are too scared to speak up. They made an example of Ben Swamn &amp; Fake Jones (Or is it Alex Jones?) as a warning to others while putting their shils like Ashton-you-got-punked-Kutcher and more recently Blakey Lively - giving an anti pedophilia speach to hollywood elite is like walking into a lion's den dressed up as steak! Mat Stone &amp; Trey Parker sure can make an episode hinting at the PG?! They were bold enough to depict George Lucas and Steven Spielberg raping Hartison Ford!

               Scary stuff. If an organization that's involved with abusing children, probably best to avoid.

                 Yes, very vindictive. Doesn't seem very "cleared" to me. A person that is vengeful is not high up on the enlightenment tree.

            What do you know about their tax exempt status?
           </p>
           <p>
            Today i am going to tell you that there is a connection between Scientology, pedophiles in the IRS, and Bill Clinton.
           </p>
           <p>
            It goes back to the Scientology pursuit of getting tax exempt status. During the early 90s the government was ridding their asses hard. They where going to destroy the cult. it was going to be good.
           </p>
           <p>
            Now Scientology leader david  miscavage was not stupid, he knew they where in trouble, so he hired an ARMY of private investigators to investigate and research the current head of the IRS, a bill Clinton appointee(from what i understand)
           </p>
           <p>
            They found something. Something so bad that the IRS head was utterly depressed, did not leave his office, and gave into all the Scientology demands. Something so bad Washington passed a law protecting religion tax exempt status.
           </p>
           <p>
            The above is known, feel free to verify it as much as you need to, and correct anything i may have gotten wrong.
           </p>
           <p>
            Now for the conjecture: People who have followed this incident believe that the IRS head was a pedophile, and that the cult set him up, recorded it, and leveraged this against him as blackmail. There is no proof.
           </p>
           <p>
            But there are supporting incidents. Mainly all the pedophile incidents in the sea org.
           </p>
           <p>
            Scientology also was behind the no child left behind law, they where pushing very hard for that law, because they profited off of it, with a for profit tutoring system, that also indoctrinates the kids.

             While I don't know the specific incidents you're referring to, it sounds about right. There have been rumors about Scientology blackmailing people for years. I mean, think about it, if what South Park said is actually what they teach, how are they even allowed to operate in this country? It's different if the authorities don't know what's going on, but when they do, and they fail to act, it takes on a whole new level of bad. And with Clinton, I doubt they had to dig very far. So many bodies ...

            Upvoat for anything South Park related because this show tackles everything fearlessly and so eyeopening. Tom Cruise probably needs a thread of his own, but I haven't seen enough of his movies to expand on this.

             Thanks, and, yes, Tom Cruise does need his own thread. Look who was in love with him ... Rosie O'Donnell! Why would a gay woman be touting him and giving him a free promo? Was there an organization behind getting him to be a household name? Lots of places to dig, and his connection to Kidman is definitely suspect, but you left something HUGE out of the list: EYES WIDE SHUT.
            </p>
            <p>
             That, too, deserves its own thread.

              duh, of course.  I didn't mean to distract from your scientology cult post. They have that Hollywood Celebrity Center where they cultivate actors and promote them with their connections, actors by profession are vulnerable, having to constantly sell themselves and subvert their egos to impersonate fictiional characters for financial support and fame. Its kind of a no brainer.

               It's not a distraction. You're simply bringing up another tentacle of the octopus reach and expanding on the conversation. Discussion is good. It raises more points of interest that a single OP post can't encompass.

             There's the rumors that Tom Cruise is gay too. If you look into his past and one time he wanted to be a priest before acting took off, he's a strange dude.

              He and John Travolta are 100% gay. Knew people in the industry. It wasn't hard to know what was what. They use Scientology to mask it bc when they were coming up, in order to be a leading man, you needed to be straight. I also don't doubt through brainwashing w Scientology they have bought into the facade of them being straight and done whatever it takes to appear that way. Katie Holmes was simply decoration to make it appear he was something he wasn't. She wasn't as stupid and compliant as they assumed either.

             I always thought Tom Cruise was a bit "weird" but I never thought he was a pedo. Perhaps just that he was queer and didn't want that getting out - but the world, even beyond Hollywood, is pretty open to at least LGB people and is becoming more open to T folk as well.
            </p>
            <p>
             But maybe his secret is that he's a pedophile, or at least that he has an attraction to kids. Scientology would know this due to their use of the E-Meter, which is similar to a lie detector test. And pedophilia is something he most certianly would not want the wider world to know about.
