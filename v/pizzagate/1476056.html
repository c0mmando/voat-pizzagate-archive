            You're right. I am one concerned mom of 4, I'm 44, not American and I know very little about how to post, edit, how to create great posts and even how to use the tools in here and it's frustrating at times, because I see things, I would like to share, but I have trouble communicating or using the tools to do it. So I stick to posting my ideas in random comment sections and it doesn't get the attention that other ideas get. I do what I can, with what I have. I have a couple of hours a day to read and research stuff, but I'm not an expert in anything in particular except maybe having an analytic aptitude and a creative imagination that could be used for memes (if I had the programs to do them). I submitted 3 posts and I can only access one of them (i don't know how to access the other 2 LOL). It's a total mess but my intentions are extremely good and come from the heart :)

            I like your spirit, but be prepared for them to up the ante, because it's coming. If you follow the definition trail on wikipedia, "fake news" is defined in no uncertain terms as having sinister intent, not just being "fake", and with the bill going through the senate and this whole Russian propaganda scare thing, and the narrative that "fake news" is "dangerous" - I predict that that soon anyone wanting to look into things like pizzagate is going to be considered a turncoat (for Russia) domestic terrorist. They already put the pieces in place to strip people of their rights should they be accused of being a terrorist, and the pieces are now in motion to selectively label alternative-media as such. Part of me doesn't want to believe it is possible, but then part of me sees it like an oncoming tsunami.
