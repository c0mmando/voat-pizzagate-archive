<p>Jérôme Kerviel and Robert Day: cross destinies - <a href="https://hichamhamza.wordpress.com/2012/10/24/jerome-kerviel-robert-day/">https://hichamhamza.wordpress.com/2012/10/24/jerome-kerviel-robert-day/</a> (translated)</p>
<blockquote>
<p>On 24 October 2012, Jérôme Kerviel, a former trader at Société Générale, was sentenced to five years in prison, including three years in prison, by the Paris Court of Appeal. He must also repay the 4.9 billion euros he had lost to his former employer.</p>
<p>In 2010, the Autorité des marchés financiers cleared Robert Addison Day , suspected of insider trading. This American billionaire, close to the Secret Service and the Bush clan, had become a member of the Board of Directors of Société Générale after having transferred to the French bank the property of his financial company, based in Los Angeles and named TCW (Trust Company of the West). It specialized in CDOs, financial products with subprime risks. Through its US subsidiary, Société Générale invested $ 40 billion in these risky investments.</p>
<p>In January 2008, just before the scandal of the Kerviel affair, Robert Day had sold more than 125 million euros of bank securities. The losses attributed then to Jérôme Kerviel - $ 4.9 billion - would not have been brought to the attention of the Californian businessman. He could not, however, ignore the gloomy prognosis of the Societe Generale about the US subprime market. By November 2007, the French bank had estimated their cost at 203 million euros before having to readjust, on January 24, 2008-day of scandal Kerviel, this figure to 2.6 billion euros.</p>
<p>Suspected a time, with the head of the investment division Jean-Pierre Mustier, to have fraudulently obtained a benefit of confidential information, Robert Day will finally be &quot;out of cause&quot; . Like its predecessor, the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Autorité des Marchés Financiers is often accommodating when it comes to tracking insider trading that may be committed by senior executives.</p>
<p>Since leaving Societe Generale, Robert Day has devoted himself entirely to his investments in the United States. The man, who joined the management of Société Générale in April 2001, will no longer be able to enlighten a Sybillin comment formulated in 2009 by Jérôme Kerviel. In off, the former trader had told Elisabeth Fleury, a journalist in Paris, that his former bank would make a record gain through the consequences on the stock markets , a terrorist act.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>&quot;  The best deals in the history of Société Générale were made on September 11, 2001. That\'s what one of my managers told me. It seems that that day the profits made were colossal &quot;</strong></p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>Société Générale <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soci%C3%A9t%C3%A9_G%C3%A9n%C3%A9rale">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soci%C3%A9t%C3%A9_G%C3%A9n%C3%A9rale</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Société Générale is France\'s third largest bank by total assets,[4] sixth largest in Europe[5] or seventeenth by market capitalization.[6] The company is a component of the Euro Stoxx 50 stock market index.[7] It is known as one of the Trois Vieilles (&quot;Old Three&quot;) of French banking, along with BNP Paribas and Crédit Lyonnais.</p>
<p>...In 2001, Société Générale acquired a controlling interest in the TCW Group. The TCW Group, which was founded in 1971, was originally known as Trust Company of the West and is the parent of TCW/Crescent Mezzanine one of the leading mezzanine capital firms in the US.[17][18] The TCW Group operated as a subsidiary of Société Générale Asset Management until it was sold to Carlyle Group.</p>
<p><strong>The Group has a long-term active and generally very discreet support policy. Its sponsorship of rugby is well-known, but its support in other fields such as music, contemporary art, disabled sport (as an official partner of the Fédération Française Handisport, the French Federation for Disabled Sports) and corporate citizenship, professional integration and disadvantaged children, is less known.</strong></p>

            Since leaving Societe Generale, Robert Day has devoted himself entirely to his investments in the United States. The man, who joined the management of Société Générale in April 2001, will no longer be able to enlighten a Sybillin comment formulated in 2009 by Jérôme Kerviel. In off, the former trader had told Elisabeth Fleury, a journalist in Paris, that his former bank would make a record gain through the consequences on the stock markets , a terrorist act.

           <p>
            Société Générale is France's third largest bank by total assets,[4] sixth largest in Europe[5] or seventeenth by market capitalization.[6] The company is a component of the Euro Stoxx 50 stock market index.[7] It is known as one of the Trois Vieilles ("Old Three") of French banking, along with BNP Paribas and Crédit Lyonnais.
           </p>
           <p>
            ...In 2001, Société Générale acquired a controlling interest in the TCW Group. The TCW Group, which was founded in 1971, was originally known as Trust Company of the West and is the parent of TCW/Crescent Mezzanine one of the leading mezzanine capital firms in the US.[17][18] The TCW Group operated as a subsidiary of Société Générale Asset Management until it was sold to Carlyle Group.
           </p>
           <p>
            <strong>
             The Group has a long-term active and generally very discreet support policy. Its sponsorship of rugby is well-known, but its support in other fields such as music, contemporary art, disabled sport (as an official partner of the Fédération Française Handisport, the French Federation for Disabled Sports) and corporate citizenship, professional integration and disadvantaged children, is less known.

            Keck Institute did the most recent telescope in Hawaii on Mauna Kea.  A new group spearheaded by Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation is trying to do a new massive one called the TMT.(30 meter telescope.)  Very little public support.  Gordon Moore was Intel guy.  Something tells me these are more money laundering ops.

            <p>
             James Addison Baker III[note 1] (born April 28, 1930)[1] is an American attorney and political figure. He served as White House Chief of Staff and United States Secretary of the Treasury under President Ronald Reagan, and as U.S. Secretary of State and White House Chief of Staff under President George H. W. Bush.
            </p>
            <p>
             ..Baker remained active in business and public affairs after Bush's defeat in the 1992 presidential election. He served as a United Nations envoy to Western Sahara and as a consultant to Enron. During the Florida recount following the 2000 Presidential election, he managed George W. Bush's legal team in the state. He served as the co-chairman of the Iraq Study Group, which Congress formed in 2006 to study Iraq and the ongoing Iraq War. He serves on the World Justice Project and the Climate Leadership Council. Baker is the namesake of the James A. Baker III Institute for Public Policy at Rice University

             Nelson Rising (born August 27, 1941) is an American businessman, chairman and CEO of Rising Realty Partners and chairman emeritus of the Real Estate Roundtable. He is also the former president and CEO of MPG Office Trust, chairman of the board of the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, and on the
             <strong>

             </strong>
            </p>
            <p>
             ...In 1994, Rising became CEO of Catellus Development Corporation.[4] Throughout the 11 year tenure he witnessed the company evolve from a railroad land company, to a diversified development company and eventually become a real estate investment trust. During his tenure, investors were granted a compounded return of 538%. There is now a street named after Nelson Rising in Mission Bay, San Francisco called Nelson Rising Lane. Rising was named Dealmaker of the Year in 2005 at San Francisco’s Business Times’ annual Real Estate Deals of the Year event. Rising stayed busy as Chairman of the Grand Committee. He was then appointed by Governor Edmund G. Brown, Jr. as Chair of the dissolution authority of the Community Redevelopment Agency in February 2012. Currently, Rising is chairman and CEO of Rising Realty Partners, LLC.,[5] chairman emeritus of the Real Estate Roundtable and chairman of the Grand Avenue Committee. He was also named chair of Governor Jerry Brown’s three-member panel to dissolve the Los Angeles Community Redevelopment Agency. Rising serves on the board of directors and executive committee of The Irvine Company and the boards of the Trust Company of the West and Foley Timber &amp; Land Company as well. Additionally, he is a member of the board of trustees and executive committees of the California Institute of Technology[6] and the W.M. Keck Foundation
