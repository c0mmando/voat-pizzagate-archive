<p>Honeybee. She often appears here, sometimes as a mod. She is a very good internet researcher, and she makes excellent connections in her various investigations. She is in contact with other investigators, and she is very gutsy. Victims have used her platform to speak out.</p>

<p>SGT Report. I like this guy, but he can be repetitive. I have enjoyed about 70% of his work. He does talk about some polarizing elements: Christianity, financial stuff and the occasional ‘out-there’ conspiracy theories. However, he BOLDY delivers the pizzagate narrative and constantly has relevant speakers.</p>

<p>Really graceful. She is one of my favorite youtubers. If you go back in time on her channel, you will see that her older stuff is just girl life style opinion vids. Her modern stuff is great though. Very respectful and poignant. Often talks about pizzagate related stuff.</p>

<p>Corbett Report. This youtuber is very smart, and informing on conspiracy. Heavy on government crime, big business corruption, medium on pedophilia.</p>

<p>There are other good youtubers who have at least one pizzagate video or two that are worth watching: </p>
<p>project veritas. They followed Luke Kuhns (If i remember correctly) into comet ping pong to tape some antifa dudes plotting to stink bomb the inauguration. Here they are posing as pimps and getting government assistance for their underage brothel:</p>

<p>Fiona Barnett. Not a youtuber, rather a victim coming forward. Her videos are informative, and a strong accusation awaiting corroboration and justice. I found her compelling.</p>

As far as I have seen, he is the ONLY person referencing the ITCCS or the International Child Abuse Tribunal or the Ninth Circle of Hell cult. There was a suggestion that he is connected to Podesta.</p>',

            Made an account to add to the list. I have done loads of research and only really share it on endchan and sometimes 8chan.
           </p>
           <p>
            I have made a couple of documentary style videos about masonic ritual abuse etc. I also host a board called /horror/ on endchan.and we have been making leaps and bounds. Fuck youtube here is a chan that you can upload up to 350mb video files.

            /horror/ Is a little meta a little meme-esque I do also have a /pizzagate/ board
            <a href="https://endchan.net/pizzagate">

            where I have screencapped over one thousand cultist instagram posts and mirrored important pg vids. Would love to have more eyes on both boards.

            I wont ban anyone unless they break endchans global site rules which is no rules except anything that is illegal under us law.
Also its anonymous so if you are used to chans but want a longer thread time this would be perfect for moderate researchers. Please give comments and add into the research we are only a couple of posters. At least lurk for fuck sakes we have masons trying to correct us and whatnot it gets amusing to see the limits the masons go to defend their cult.

             Thanks. Mods asked me to take down and adjust the title, then re submit. So I could upvote, but I will be on the look out to do so in th future, if you have something to say.
