<p>Yup, these pervs lobbied AGAINST our kids and FOR predators. Wrap your brain around that one for awhile! </p>

<p>Here\'s more from the same link given above. It\'s so frightening: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>For decades the sexual abuse of young athletes by their coaches lingered just beneath the surface in American swimming’s otherwise golden waters.</p>
<p>In 2005, USA Swimming president Ron Van Pool decided it was time to bring the issue to the surface.</p>
<p>Giving his annual State of Swimming address, Van Pool pushed for a more aggressive approach within the sport to taking on sexual abuse. </p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Five years later, Wielgus was asked in a deposition if, in the wake of Van Pool’s speech, if USA Swimming had taken any steps to bring the organization up to speed on the sexual abuse issue?</p>
<p>“No,” said Wielgus, who died last April after a lengthy battle with colon cancer. </p>
<p>...</p>
<p>The two decades after Wielgus was hired at USA Swimming have been marked by record-shattering Olympic success and the organization’s inability to check swimming’s culture of sexual abuse, a failure that has resulted in hundreds of new young victims, SCNG has found.</p>
<p>USA Swimming repeatedly missed opportunities to overhaul a culture within American swimming where the sexual abuse of underage swimmers by their coaches and others in positions of power within the sport was commonplace and even accepted by top officials and coaches, according to the documents and interviews with sexual abuse survivors, former Olympians, USA Swimming officials, safe sport advocates and some of USA Swimming’s leading financial benefactors.</p>
<p>For example, three U.S. Olympic team head coaches, and a USA Swimming vice president were told in the 1980s that a world-renowned coach has sexually abused a female swimmer beginning when she was 12. Wielgus was informed of allegations against the coach at least three times in recent years. But not only did USA Swimming not pursue a case against the coach, it allowed him to continue to have access to USA Swimming facilities, U.S. Olympic and national team events, and the Olympic Training Center. USA Swimming even awarded the club owned and operated by him more than $40,000 in grants. The coach was only banned after pleading guilty to sexual assault, more than a quarter-century after the abuse was first brought to the attention of the Olympic coaches.</p>
<p>• In the more than 20 years since Wielgus took charge of USA Swimming in July 1997, at least 252 swim coaches and officials have been arrested, charged by prosecutors, or disciplined by USAS for sexual abuse or misconduct against individuals under 18. Those coaches and officials have a total of at least 590 alleged victims, some of them abused while attending pre-school swim classes.</p>

            Giving this the "Share!" flair MigratoryPatterns. We need to get this and a couple of our other threads on US Gymnastics back over to the Chans for some meme-making. "These people are sick!"

           <p>
            Also, I want to know who appointed this steaming turd, as well as the Gymnastics doctor piece of shit. Still no answers have turned up on that question.

            These pedophilia cases are going to keep resurfacing in every sport.
           </p>
           <p>
            There's a basic reason:
            <strong>
             Wherever you have kids being concentrated together for an activity, pedophiles will involve themselves in the activity
            </strong>
            , to get access to the children.

             If something is wrong, expose it, stop it, arrest those guilty, and purge the evil from the organization's midst by blating it from the rooftops! That's how you get rid of swamp creatures. They like to hide in the dark.

              Migratorypatterns, the only reason I was red pilled so easily, is that a freaked out family doctor friend had to accept pg as a fact of life. And, then, told us about it and all the things that can be tainted by whars going on. As far as Western Civilization is concerned, Europe started having the problems first, after everything from Asia started moving there. If anyone thinks it's made up, ask a nurse,  NP, doctor, surgeon if it's true and watch them squirm and start to back pedal because of the danger they have found themselves in trying to not say "too much."  They truly are in the rock and hard place scenario. But, I have no oNE here at my house I can talk to about it. Significant  other thinks I am way too seriously red pilled. But, i think I am just on the fringes of the terrible things that are happening. Pretty sure one day I will be able to say....told you so.
Unfortunately.

             not just pedos -- Satanists - Pedophilia is a pillar of their belief system. So is pure deception and malice towards others.

             I know. And these ringmasters like Weilgus die before these stories come out. Just like Saville. And the Penn State scandal. Sandusky was convicted, but Paterno never had to face any part of a trial for covering up the abuse.

             As for the coaching situation, I don't doubt it. These kids are the overachievers ... the group leaders would emerge from. If not leaders, they'll be the doers. By molesting them, they're injecting sexuality at a young age in the hopes of creating more monsters like themselves. Not all children will be so affected. Most will be kind, compassionate, and only seek to protect, but this majority will endure the suffering forever. And that does influence choices. The small percentage that is awakened to evil through this abuse are the future swamp creatures.
            </p>
            <p>
             But anyone can readily understand why this is devastating to the direction of laws, families, schools, and coaching.

             Didn't even think about that. That's another entirely different aspect to this scandal. Because even if your goddaughter didn't say anything. did something happen? So sorry. Hope it turns out that she had a coach who wasn't a scumball.

            Excellent, but not surprising. I suspect cheerleading coaches will be next. I know of one male cheer coach who blew his brains out after being accused of fiddling w kids.

             Cheerleading ... yup, you're probably right. All those cheerleading camps. There would be plenty of opportunity ... and where there's opportunity, you'll find pervs.
