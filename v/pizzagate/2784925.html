            The link between gangs and child trafficking reminds me of this passage from John DeCamp’s
            <em>
             The Franklin Coverup.
            </em>
            (Second edition, 1996, pp. 240)
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             One of [Investigator Gary] Caradori’s informants stated that [Sheriff Robert] Wadman was instrumental in bringing the drug-trafficking gangs, the Los Angeles-based Bloods and Cryps, into Omaha. According to a June 19, 1989 report by Caradori’s predecessor at the Franklin committee, Jerry Lowe, members of the Bloods and Cryps were identified by local police as driving Larry King’s car.
            </p>
           </blockquote>
           <p>
            Larry King and his stooges helped funnel money to the Nicaraguan Contras via the Franklin Credit Union and probably also through selling drugs, porn, kids. There is another article about the CIA, drugs and gangs on a black Muslim website (think: Malcom X before he broke from Elijah Muhammad) called the
            <a href="http://www.finalcall.com/features/cia-dope.html">
             Final Call
            </a>
            , which says some weird shit but this article seems on point.

            I've noted in previous comments that a lot of street level child pimps turn out to be black (specifically in Milwaukee WI and Maricopa County AZ). I wonder if these are also gang related.

             Here is another site    Insane Spanish Cobras

             In 1976 Richard “King Cobra” Medina took over control of the Spanish Cobras and immediately reached out to the Latin Disciples street gang because he knew the Disciples were having a major problem with the “U.F.O” (United Five Organization) which was the alliance of white power gangs the C-Notes, Gaylords, Taylor Jousters, Chi West, and PVPs or PVRs that had been going on since 1973 and was growing stronger. There was also the Latin Kings that were really large in size and trying to take over everything. This new unity became known as the “Young Latino Organization” or “YLO.” In 1978 YLO opened its doors to the Imperial Gangsters and Latin Eagles to create the “United Latino Organization” or “ULO.”
            </p>
            <p>
             On November 11th 1978 Larry Hoover, the leader of the Black Gangster Disciple Nation created the Folk Nation alliance behind prison walls. His goal was to immediately unite the BGDs and Black Disciples and to also unite with Latino and white gangs. The Spanish Cobras were one of the Latino gangs that were asked to join the Folk Nation along with some other allies like the Imperial Gangsters, Latin eagles, Orquestra Albany and the Latin Disciples. The Spanish Cobras were also allied with the Simon City Royals and the Almighty Insane Popes.
            </p>
            <p>
             The Spanish Cobras had become highly organized at this point in time which is known as the “Capone era,” and a lot of that was credited to King Cobra and maybe that is why his praises went so far that he was accredited as the founder of the Spanish Cobras. Realistically he was just the founder of a more organized Cobra gang. His Brothers Jaime and William moved up to Milwaukee, Wisconsin and started the Milwaukee chapter of the Spanish Cobras. These three men knew how to organize and had charisma and that is why they were legends to the organization.
            </p>
            <p>
             Tragedy struck on April 12, 1979 when Richard King Cobra Medina had just pulled up at his residence at Maplewood and Division with his girlfriend and their new born baby. Richard could smell something in the air and somehow knew something bad was going to go down. He told his girl to take the baby and hurry up and get inside. Richard began unloading the baby car seat and as he did a car pulled up and fired several bullets into his body and he was found slumped over the baby seat and was DOA at the scene, he was 40 years old when he died, contrary to what the newspapers said that he was in his early 20s, but his grave stone says he was born on January 7, 1939. The Leavitt and Schiller Insane Unknowns were to blame for the murder in retaliation for the killing of Ruben Perez an original Insane Unknown. The Cobras were now full of hate and ready to kill.

             WOW.  I had no idea there were that many gangs in Chicago.

            Ryan Ulman can be found on Twitter with a link to Instinct's website on his page. The site has not only been taken down but when you try to find past versions of it on the Wayback machine you'll have no luck. Seems the sites entire history has been wiped.
