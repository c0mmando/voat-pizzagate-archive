<p>Unless tumblr actively shuts it down, they just keep making new accounts. Many of them have the same usernames or kinds of names. Lots of DD/lg kink-to-pedo pipeline.

            I'd heard something different about the Aussie police. I thought it went like this:
           </p>
           <p>
            The site was on the deep web and they'd been hunting the webmaster for a long time. Eventually they tracked him down based upon some unusual greeting that he would use when posting, then doing searches based on that. He turned out to be that child services worker that you mentioned.
           </p>
           <p>
            They brought the guy in and got his passwords. Everything was done quietly, no-one was aware that he was caught. They closed the site to new members, and used it to trace the identities of people who were already members. As I heard it, they caught a lot of pedos in a lot of different countries based on the info from that site.
           </p>
           <p>
            All that said, I didn't know they'd been running the site for nearly a year. That's an awful long time to accomplish the purpose that they said they were accomplishing.

            Pedophilia is actually a part of the Satanic religion. They think that raping a kid and stealing their innocence gives them spiritual power and helps them open up a vortex.

            There's a gay porn body builder tumblr called Geek to Freek. Don't look at it. But know that it exists and it's possibly named after Greg Chism from Toy Freaks. I think that these people enjoy getting together to rape kids in parties.

            jews don't give a shit about fucking children. In fact, their Talmud condones it. They've known for millennia the best way to destabilize a nation is to rape its children, which in turn puts mothers in a perpetual state of fear. The worst part is that no one ever does anything about it, and it doesn't appear they ever will.

             Do you think it's possible that all major religions have been infiltrated and compromised? All religions have their fair share of pedos. The Satanic Khazars infiltrated the Jews. But the Popes were seem to have been no different.

              I don't think it's like that at all. I think that power corrupts, and absolute power corrupts absolutely. Religion is an absolute power, so I think it's fundamentally corrupt. It's just another form of MK ULTRA, but it includes spiritual bondage in addition to mind control. I think major religions are death cults with different mascots.

               exactly.  I think religions were created by Satanists to hide behind a veil of morality.  This is why priests have always wore black robes. It is ancient Satan Worship

                Exactly. Like how this Ash Jews who are not Jewish at all hide behind the Jewish label so they can claim victimhood when they were the ones who victimized them in the first place. basically everything is a lie and nothing is what it seems.

                Satan isn't an ancient deity though. He's merely an archetype based on previous deaities such as Saturn, Set, Ba'al, etc. Death is what it's all about.

            This is just not sinking in.  I can't believe what this all means.  They will continue operating no matter what?  I am flummoxed.  What in the world is there to do about this.  This is so disappointing and sad.

                It must be really hard for the police to navigate it and that is why it still hasn't been shut down or they are enjoying what is on here.  That's why they stick to other places, easier nuts to crack. Well, we can't do it all.  Our job is to keep posting about it and to keep waking people up.  We can't police the world  or go digging around in  the dark web.  Thanks for the post.

            The article about Elm House is sickening.  I have read about it before and have seen that possible members could also include Cliff Richard and Elton John.  They said names were redacted in a report.  Those poor children from Grafton Close.  One story was about two boys that were brought there after their Mum committed suicide.  Imagine that.  Two boys had to deal with that heartbreaking news and then they were brought to Elm house to be abused by a bunch of elitist perverted Nancys. Some said they had to dress as fairies before the abuse.  Horrid. Yuck.

             No problem, I hope this isn't old news for you guys. I was afraid to post too much directly becuase I don't want people investigating this getting into troucbler. I tried to add as many leads as possible though. Be careful treading in these waters!

                No u can post whatever u want.  The kikeshill mods just kept deleting his rambling submission about the Jewish daycare and he sperged out until they banned him, they kept fighting in another subverse, found his kiwifarms, it was a comical episode.

                Anyway this sub is dead, partly cuz half became Qtards, and now their sub is also spammed to shit with drivel from reddit boomerfags.  All because that dumb slut housewife

                 Your comment is about this sub (pizzagate) being dead.
                </p>
                <p>
                 Is it because the Boomer fags on QRV and TheAwakening (reddit refuges) are shitting up the front page due to their sheer numbers?
                </p>
                <p>
                 Is it something else?
                </p>
                <p>
                 I'm a boomer. I speak the lingo and I've thought about herding a few of them to pizzagate to give them a real red pill.
                </p>
                <p>
                 I have not done so because they may shit up pizzagate as well. I haven't been on this sub for ages and i DO THINK it's because I've been following Q off and on.. I have been here for 2 years, so I'm not part of the Neon Revolt subs and qtard subs.
                </p>
                <p>
                 Do you think it would be bad or good to let them know about the recent research results here?
                </p>
                <p>
                 Please answer as a reply in this thread. I don't do messages because my inbox is spammed with "kill the jews."

                  I not only think it would be a good idea, I think that it is essential if these folks are going to weather the storm once the full facts are revealed as Q has implied much of them will be. Most of these folks are not aware of how many times Q has referenced what we have uncovered in pizzagate. You can check my submission history for a couple of posts about that.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  Don't worry about shitting up the sub. We have submission rules that prevent off topic shitposts, and we are good at administering them in a helpful and hospitable way.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  Also, be advised the user you are replying to here, auralsects, is a malicious shill who tries very hard to derail investigation into pizzagate. We've got a sticky up about the group he belongs to right now in

                 Could you ask your handler if she (I'm assuming your handler is female, because you are a bitch) could bring back Donkey? You are a sad, boring, unfunny copy of Donkey... You know this, and so does everyone else.
