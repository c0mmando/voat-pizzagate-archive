<p>Recently, a group of seeking homeless veterans in Tucson came upon what they described as a sex trafficking camp on the outskirts of large property owned by a multinational cement company from Mexico. While no one is exactly surprised that such a thing is happening near the American border, news media were quick to dismiss the allegations and the various connections between CEMEX, The Clinton Foundation and various powerful figures on multiple continents.</p>
<p>I began looking at other Cemex plants to see if there was a pattern, some commonality between all the plants I could use to confirm or deny the potential existence of so-called sex-trafficking camps or operations. And boy, I was not expecting this.</p>
<p>A series of cement companies around the world appear to be working closely or setting up show adjacent to golf courses, athletic centers, nature preserves, trampoline parks and amusement parks, dog racing tracks, but mostly (and in some regions, almost exclusively) golf courses. At first, I thought that my biases were just making me see two large rural properties close by. But then I realized that this setup also happened in both urban and coastal settings.</p>
<p>Cement companies involved include some of the world\'s largest, but most importantly our first two, LafargeHolcim and Cemex. We have also looked at LafargeHolcim subsidiaries around the world and seen an identical pattern. </p>
<p><strong>Methodology:</strong></p>
<p>Cement plants owned by LafargeHolcim, CEMEX, St.Mary\'s cement and its subsidiaries were evaluated for proximity to golf courses.
Included are those which are either attached, on the same street, rail line, river, within approximately a mile in an urban environment and a little more in rural areas, though about 20 images have been omitted because the golf courses are not beside each other. 
After extended evaluation, other symbols, such as the four-pointed baseball diamond, were considered as potential signs of a criminal presence
In countries where golf is less popular, proximity is considered less important (but I still found this pattern in Indonesia, Philippines and even with a Dangote Cement plant in Ghana).</p>
<p>Back roads, service roads, private dirt paths and routes preventing interstate/highway use are considered especially important. 
The use of landscaping and gravel is considered an incentive to keep golf courses near cement plants. But after extensive research, it appeared that having a gravel plant nearby was not a necessity for many golf courses. </p>

            Checked my immediate area and came up with Prestancia in South Sarasota, and Murdock (two golf courses.) There are not service roads that I know of, but it does not matter in those two places.

            Recently a center called the
            <a href="https://www.denverpost.com/2017/09/28/el-pueblo-boys-and-girls-ranch-closed/">
             "El Pueblo Boys and Girls Ranch"
            </a>
            was shut down due to children being underfed and abused. Not much else has taken place from the story, the news was reporting on this, but did not have enough money to fund proper research.
           </p>
           <p>
            This was all exposed by one woman. The real kicker is that Judges, DA's, and also the well-renowned and accused pedophile, Jeffrey Claude Bartleson was involved with the
            <a href="https://www.denverpost.com/2009/02/05/molestation-allegations-against-well-regarded-puebloan/">
             El Pueblo Boys and Girls Ranch
            </a>
            . Bartleson was also responsible for writing the book,

            .
           </p>
           <p>
            When you look at the

             Governing Board
            </a>
            of El Pueblo Boys and girls ranch, you can see that lead detective in Pueblo,
            <a href="https://www.pueblo.us/2062/Criminal-Investigations">
             Eric Bravo
            </a>
            served on the board.

            Further investigation leads to a Comic Book Store, right next to a Potica store (w/ possible Pedo Logo) and a nightclub. The Comic book store is secured by a barbed wire fence, connected to a large facility, with a garage and house, right across the street from a tire store. This could be ironic, no leads on this yet, but it could prove to be something.
           </p>

            Google street view is acting strange as well, once you go to the Potica store and see the symbolic swirl, you can see the Comic Book store has been painted, and once you go to the comic book store on Google Street view, the paint is not there yet.
           </p>
           <p>
            I also feel like the "Loves" gas station (w/ heart logos) is somehow involved in all of this, recently I had talked w/ nurses from Pueblo, Colorado who stated that the Loves in Pueblo, Colorado is the most trafficked location in Colorado. Loves is situated in the same parking lot as a dispensary called, "Strawberry Fields"

            Any help in uncovering this would be great.

            Hillary Clinton not only had connections to Cemex but also to LaFarge that also involved Isis at one point
            <a href="https://www.thecanary.co/global/2016/07/29/paris-strikes-astonishing-partnership-secret-isis-sponsor-ties-hillary-clinton/">
             https://www.thecanary.co/global/2016/07/29/paris-strikes-astonishing-partnership-secret-isis-sponsor-ties-hillary-clinton/
            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            Lafarge also has close ties to Democrat presidential candidate Hillary Clinton. Apart from being a regular donor to the Clinton Foundation, Clinton herself was a director of Lafarge in the early 1990s, and did legal work for the firm in the 1980s. During her connection to Lafarge, the firm was implicated in facilitating a CIA-backed covert arms export network to Saddam Hussein.
           </p>
           <p>
            Among its earliest benefactors was former First Lady and current presidential hopeful, Hillary Clinton.
           </p>
           <p>
            From 1990 to 1992, Clinton served on Lafarge’s Board of Directors. Under her tenure, Lafarge’s Ohio subsidiary was caught burning hazardous waste to fuel cement plants. Clinton defended the decision at the time.
           </p>
           <p>
            Then just before her husband, Bill Clinton, was elected president in 1992, Lafarge was fined $1.8 million by the Environmental Protection Agency for these pollution violations. Hillary Clinton had left the board of Lafarge in spring, just after her husband won the Democrat nomination. A year later, under Bill’s presidency, the Clinton administration reduced Lafarge’s EPA fine to less than $600,000.
           </p>
           <p>
            In 2013, Lafarge’s Executive Vice President for Operations, Eric Olson, was a ‘featured attendee’ at the Clinton Global Initiative’s annual meeting.
           </p>
           <p>
            The company is a regular donor to the Clinton Foundation – the firm’s up to $100,000 donation was listed in its annual donor list for 2015. Lafarge is also listed again as a donor to the Clinton Foundation for the first quarter of 2016.
           </p>
           <p>
            <a href="https://www.mintpressnews.com/hillary-clinton-served-on-the-board-of-a-company-who-funds-is/219060/">
             https://www.mintpressnews.com/hillary-clinton-served-on-the-board-of-a-company-who-funds-is/219060/
            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            In a recent tweet, WikiLeaks reported its unveiling of Clinton’s dubious ties to Lafarge, an American company owned by a French conglomerate that, between 2011 and 2013, paid taxes to the Islamic State (ISIS) in order to protect its cement factory 95 miles northeast of Aleppo, Syria. The arrangements were discovered by the French daily, Le Monde. The story became relevant once again after the Office of the Mayor of Paris recently struck a corporate partnership naming Lafarge as its main supplier.
           </p>
           <p>
            Lafarge bought the cement plant in Syria in 2007, but in 2011, civil war broke out, forcing Lafarge to make the choice of paying the terrorist organization to continue production. The taxes were allegedly paid to ISIS middlemen and other rebel groups in Syria.
           </p>
           <p>
            Another investigation carried out by Zaman al-Wasl, an independent news organization based in Syria, adds that Lafarge may have also bought oil from ISIS regularly.
           </p>
           <p>
            Why is it so imperative and important that the Clintons have connections to the Two Largest Cement Companies in the World.

The church consists of four sites: HTB Brompton Road, HTB Onslow Square (formerly St Paul's, Onslow Square), HTB Queen's Gate (formerly St Augustine's, South Kensington) and HTB Courtfield Gardens (formally St Jude's Church, Kensington – officially in the parish of St Mary of the Boltons but part of HTB), as well as being the home of the St Paul's Theological Centre and the Alpha Course. It is where the Alpha Course was first developed and is one of the most influential churches in the Church of England.

           <blockquote>
            <p>
             One graduate of HTB is
             <strong>
              Justin Welby, who will be the next archbishop of Canterbury
             </strong>
             . Though Christianity had been very much part of his school and college days, he started worshipping here in the 1980s, just as the HTB phenomenon was taking off. He had a formal role as a lay leader for several years before going to seminary in 1989.
            </p>
            <p>
             The focus following Welby's surprise appointment to Lambeth Palace – after just a year as bishop of Durham – has been on his Eton pedigree and business background as an oil executive. But at least one churchy website has looked elsewhere for the reason this dark horse pipped more favoured runners to the line: "HTB lands its first archbishop of Canterbury" ran its headline.

            A lot of this is due to similarity in global zoning regulations - a result of global city planning - global conferences, etc.   These are not the only similarities that are appearing in cities world wide these days.

            The field of urban planning is teaching the same material everywhere.

            Cement plants go beside golf courses - and other outlying urban fringe / light industrial infrastructure.   Lower taxes and more flexible regulation on the fringe.   Crime too resides there - lower enforcement, lower police coverage.

            , I'm really glad you did this post.  I've been wondering about golf courses for a long time now.  And maybe your post shows I'm not crazy.  When Obama had a reputation for going off to golf courses all the time it really peaked my interest.  I'm pretty good at reading people and he never struck me as the type to be crazy about golf.  I wondered if he used that as an excuse for something else.  Bush was another president that was always off on a golf course.
           </p>
           <p>
            Anyway, I've been working on another thread and come across construction companies who sell crushing equipment. It sent my mind to the whole Cemex thing. You should read through the comments on this post if you have time:

           <p>
            Also, I thought I'd look at Tucson because of this:

           <p>
            So, I went to Google maps and looked for the

            Interesting pattern. Every Country Club in my city has at least one of those symbols you listed. Not sure about cement location proximity, but will dig now and update later. In your opinion, are the cement plants solely for disposing bodies, or do they serve another function as well?

            Interesting, but I will throw this out there &gt;&gt; This could be geologically oriented. Golf courses are very frequently built upon a porous substrate, where water drains quickly and does not pool in large quantities. This is the same type of sandy material that is used in the manufacturing of cement.

             I want to think like you. But I had a look around my area (Scotland) some say the home of golf as our courses are mostly not man made and are natural parts of the landscape. 
I really think the OP is on to something. 
I searched for Cemex on google map in Scotland.
            </p>
            <p>
             In Fife there is a Cemex plant/quarry right next door to Ladybank golf course.
            </p>
            <p>
             The world's most famous golf course, St Andrews Old Course is literally a 20 minute drive away.
            </p>
            <p>
             In Perth there is a Cemex plant right next to their golf course.
            </p>
            <p>
             Edinburgh's Cemex is also besides a golf course and a dock.
            </p>
            <p>
             Cardenen Cemex plant/quarry also has the Auchterderren golf course adjacent.
            </p>
            <p>
             There is a weird anomaly next to this golf course. A huge orange blob. Like a part of the satellite image has been hidden.
Sorry I cant post pics due to not being near a computer atm but please someone have a look, is it just a Google map glitch?

             Good one. Cement plants are usually located on gravel and sand pits. Such pits, when used up are often turned into golf courses. Look up "golf course gravel pit" (without the quotes).
            </p>
            <p>
             This might explain the coincidences. (However a used up gravel pit being turned into a golf course would be a good place to stick bodies.)

             Good point. Although now that I'm looking into LaFarge subsidiaries, I'm finding that golf courses tend to also be built near corporate cement company buildings, like this
             <a href="https://www.google.ca/maps/place/Hima+Cement+Limited/@0.3274977,32.5876261,2692a,35y,90h/data=!3m1!1e3!4m5!3m4!1s0x177dbb81c2f931d1:0x8a1da443d43aea4!8m2!3d0.3263089!4d32.5836706">
              Hima cement building in Uganda.
             </a>
             Right by the golf course.

              This report claims there were child labor violations involved at this plant. Interesting nonetheless.

             Interesting observation, Ian. I was thinking along similar lines, but wondering if maybe there was something about land prices at certain phases of growth/wealth in a given community that would explain the correlation. Your idea makes sense. Do you have any links to back that up?

             , did you consider this? You may want to add it to the body of your thread.

              You just said you were thinking the same thing as this comment from IAN .... "This could be geologically oriented. Golf courses are very frequently built upon a porous substrate, where water drains quickly and does not pool in large quantities. This is the same type of sandy material that is used in the manufacturing of cement.".... Sure you were. LMAO!

               No, I said Ian's observation was a good one, and that I, too, was wondering if there was some shared quality that would explain the two types of sites being found together. I was thinking more along the lines of growth/community development/level of wealth, but geological could make sense, zoning could make sense, or all three of them could.

            You should go on any pizzagate thread on /pol/ on 4chan and ask about "golf rumours".  I think you may be actually right on the money.

              "Okay so at the PGA tournament 2009, a politico journalist apparently attended some after party and discovered occult shit happening in the basement, not just your normal larping satanist wannabes but some truly sick shit. She posted a story about it, which was immediately taken down, presumably after the powers at be threatened her. There was more chatter than they were comfortable with in online golf forums (which are now deleted) and a few days after the Tiger Woods sex scandal was posted by National Enquirer. 
Tiger Woods ruined his image to bury this story, there was more info on it on some onion site but I can't seem to find it. 
All surface web traces of it have been wiped outside of threads like this.

            A couple of thoughts:
           </p>
           <p>
            1) Where do you put a concrete plant?  On lots of land.  Where do you put a gold course?  On lots of land.
           </p>
           <p>
            2) Concrete plants are often erected in close proximity to very large projects (stadiums, large buildings, municipal projects, etc.).  Find out what recent projects are going on near new plant locations.
           </p>
           <p>
            3) CEMEX likely owns or partners with companies who own boring machines.  Think of what traffickers could do with a boring machine and a concrete plant on their side.
           </p>
           <p>
            4) If you want an unrelated example, this place:

            A concrete plant is located just off this graphic.  This is why the FBI canned their HQ move:

             Just checked out the pattern in the UK and indeed there is a definite correlation in the proximity of golf courses to cement plants and quarries. However it would be jumping the gun a just bit to assume that its for easy disposal of bodies. After the land has been quarried until its useless to them, the plant moves next door to a fresh bit and the previous site is sold off fairly cheap and makes a good site for a golf course. I'd be very surprised if the explanation differs significantly from that.

              The Scottish golf courses I mentioned in another comment were built before the quarries.
             </p>
             <p>
              Most of these golf courses were created in the 1800s or very early 1900s.
             </p>
             <p>
              Yet they all have a Cemex plant directly next to them.
             </p>
             <p>
              I find that suspect.

              I live really close by to the quarries, just cross over the road and there's the golf course. Busy motorway nearby also.

              Do we have documented cases of this happening on a fairly regular basis? It makes sense. We should be able to dig up the land sales records.

            Gonna be a skeptic, and ask, is it possible that a cement factory and a golf course are symbiotic? For instance, under the sand in bunkers do they have special type of cement that allows water drainage, and also by products of cement factories such as potash or potassium are used as some sort of fertilizer on steroroids. Making the creation and maintenance of a gold course in close proximity to a cement plant a money saving arrangement?

             I'm gonna say yes, but Cemex/Holcim cement plants are not only appearing beside golf courses. You're also getting truck lots, train depots and other types terminal stations like river and seaports. Which again is still a reasonable way to transport cement, but if you look at many of the images you'll find a lot of casinos, zoos, amusement parks, water parks, trampoline zones among the golf courses.

            This is creepy. Elites have their pizza parties after a 18 holes and a round of beers. Afterwards, the evidence is disposed of in the premix lime vat.

              I have read very little about her. Is that the Dutch cousin of the Windsors? I think they own BP or Shell Oil. Do you have a link for anything suspicious about her? Amsterdam, the worldwide pedo tourist hotspot is in her country... if I’m thinking of the right royal.

               Well if you knew nothing more than that it would still be very telling (I didnt btw interesting) but what I do know is from this whole thing and I think it was like hunting children at picnics (I may be mixing up two stories forgive me) but I know it was hunting people. Not good...Didnt she also wear a pizza pin when she met the spirit cooker herself MA?

                 It looks like it but I am not sure...creepy huh? Their incessant need to show the symbolism will ultimately (I hope!) be their downfall...But we are talking about royalty with is above reproach so they might just be flaunting it in our faces AGAIN with little worry of action being taken against them. Sadly the latter is most likely true.

             I think an important part of these satellite images is just how many service roads are used between the cement plants and the golf courses. You'll notice many examples of trucks not having to travel on busy or even occupied roads.

              The service roads aspect has given me a pit in my stomach. This is all plausible given the secrecy and money. Golf is not cheap. Belonging to a Country Club is not cheap. Is golf really all that the members are paying for?

            While I'm not completely convinced there's something here, but I am intrigued. I used to work for a company that cleaned tanks on military ships, so of course, they had a lot of government contracts. The owner of the company would hold an annual golf tournament, which had a lot of government employee and contractors in attendance. The golf course is surely a place you can talk and be pretty sure you aren't being listened to as long as the battery is removed from your phone and you trust the person you're talking to.

             I appreciate your skepticism. I didn't think much of it when I started looking, but some of these are so obvious it's painful. I would say there's about 12 on that list where you can literally walk off a putting green into the cement plant.

              I don't doubt your research, and you went to a lot of trouble, but the question remains - why would someone want or need to take a short stroll from a golf course to a cement plant?
             </p>
             <p>
              Golf courses usually have country clubs, which have restaurants that have large freezers. Then, you have golf carts that can easily transport anything just across the street.
             </p>
             <p>
              Well, I'm going to have to think about this. The only other thing I noticed that would have a connection is the dog racing because they use greyhounds for blood transfusions, and thinking about that post about needing blood for cement, this may be related, but tracks are closing down everywhere in the US. Australia's another story though.

                  I know, I have never heard of that one. I worked in a guy's house that supplies chicken fighters supplies worldwide. Spurs, vitamins, steroids, anti parasitics .. whatever. He was a pretty weird guy. Who pays for college and sets that as their business model for success? He said the hardest part was talking to so many languages on the phone. I was wondering how he was still in business, as it illegal in the USA.

                Yes, some retired greyhounds are sent to what's called a "blood farm" where all they do is stay cooped up in a crate and let outside when necessary until it's time for them to donate blood again that's used for other dogs who are in need of it.
