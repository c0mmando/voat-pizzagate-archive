            I can't find out the ages of these women.  There will be no charges because of the SOL running out.  BUT a couple were around 1986 &amp; 88 so what if these women were interns or 17?  That's 32 yrs. ago.  CBS is investigating the accusations.  WHAT?  I thought police would do that.  Fox guarding hen house again.  Depending on the ages this might me sexual abuse of a minor.

            According to paperwork from the D.A.’s office, the anonymous accuser said Moonves sexually abused her on July 1, 1986. The paperwork also noted two separate incidents dated January 1, 1988.
           </p>
           <p>
            Moonves was CEO when David Letterman was cheating on Rita with Stephanie.  He was very patient and understanding. Hmm.

            I read that he will, in fact, act as a kind of advisor to CBS for another year or so, keeping an office there and a security detail. Also, CBS paid (or will pay) the $ 20,000,000 he has to pay to charities.

            , I will give this the 24 Hour Grace flair, in case you can show that this is directly related to the sexual abuse of kids by the global elite (were any of the victims minors?). However, if there is no direct connection, we'll have to take this down per Rule 1 and you'll need to repost it in either
            <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/v/pizzagatewhatever">
             v/pizzagatewhatever
            </a>
            or
            <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/v/GreatAwakening">
             v/GreatAwakening
            </a>
            .
           </p>
           <p>
            If there's an angle where you think this guy's proclivities somehow affected CBS's coverage of child sex abuse claims, that would work as well, but you'd need to state that clearly and link to the supporting evidence. Thanks!
