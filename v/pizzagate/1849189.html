<p>snippet:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>FBI Director James Comey testified before Senate Judiciary Committee on May 3
Comey claimed Hillary Clinton\'s top aide Huma Abedin forwarded classified emails to the laptop belonging to her husband, Anthony Weiner
FBI officials now acknowledge that Comey\'s testimony was inaccurate 
FBI director James Comey has allegedly admitted to exaggerating the number of Hillary Clinton emails involved in the scandal that was blamed on her losing the presidency race. 
In his sworn Senate testimony, The FBI chief told the judiciary committee top Clinton aide Huma Abedin made \'a regular practice’ of forwarding ‘hundreds and thousands’ of emails to her husband Anthony Weiner, ‘some of which contain classified information.’
But it is understood FBI officials have privately acknowledged that Comey’s testimony was false as a result of an inspection brought about by a DailyMail.com exclusive on Weiner\'s emails.
The bureau is also probing Comey\'s controversial decision to notify lawmakers just before the election that his team was re-examining its investigation into Clinton\'s emails by looking into messages found on Weiner\'s laptop.
The letter is viewed by many as costing Clinton the election, since she lost by less than a percentage point in key swing states after polling indicated she was well in front of her opponent before the FBI chief\'s move. </p>

             Lol... but he's right.. the insurance folder stuff was started from speculation online, it never came from one legitimate source. ever. Most people here know this. Don't be so quick to call other people shills, it only makes you look like one. Stop being such a faggot.

            This is wrong in several ways.  Comey is not backpedaling.  This coming from journalists, not Comey.  In fact this makes Comey look bad.  The FBI is going to have to issue a correction to his recent testimony.

            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            Furthermore, this undermines Comey's decision to write his pre-election letter.  Comey was using this as a justification.

            There are none.   This became part of the fake narrative about the laptop.  The NYPD  never found evidence on the laptop either.  They never even had the laptop.
           </p>
           <p>
            The ”life insurance” idea started from some random Twitter user.   It was probably a joke.    There's no evidence for this.

             No, you are wrong in several ways, as usual.  Your attempt at fake news is not proof that there was no laptop.  What is your proof that they never had the laptop?  Because you said so?  Your record is extremely suspect since your are on THEIR payroll.  The rumor was "probably a joke".  Again "probably" is not  definite proof.   RweSure you are full of baloney?  Yes.

              You misunderstand what I wrote.  I never said there was no laptop.  I said there was no "life insurance folder" on the laptop.

             <p>
              The laptop existed it was seized and examined by the FBI.  The NYPD never had the laptop.   All the stories about what the NYPD "found" on the laptop are fake.  They were never in possession of it.  Only the FBI was.

              The joke part doesn't actually matter whatsoever in terms of proof, it's just my read on the original comment.  This story started with a person on twitter who had absolutely no information what did or did not exist on Wiener's laptop. If they were not joking, they were lying because they knew nothing about Wiener's laptop. The reason I think it was a joke, was that this person knew that the original audience for comment would know there was no connection to the case whatsoever and no insider information.   It has as much value as if I said that Jared Kushner was cooperating with the FBI.  It was passed around and repeatedly and along the way the humor was lost.
             </p>
             <p>
              If you look up Wiener's laptop on this board, you can see where I lay out my case as to why the NYPD never had Wiener's laptop.
             </p>
             <p>
              I also just proved there's no connection from Alefantis to Laura Silsby, but that is for another day.

            Comey needs to be prosecuted for treason. He knows what is going on in Racine, Wisconsin and how it is all connected to Pizzagate and Global Criminal Corruption, and is grossly negligent and an accomplice to criminal corruption at best.
           </p>
           <p>
            Where is the RICO investigation into Racine, Wisconsin? Where are the indictments? If the FBI cannot connect the dots from Racine to the Clintons, the FBI is absolutely corrupt, dysfunctional and inoperable. This is a case of protecting the racket, and that racket leads to Pizzagate and Global Criminal Corruption.

              Yes, we have have specifics and many links, some of which have already been posted in various comments and replies, some of which have been distributed to trusted sources, and some of which is set to begin publishing June 10. Every time we reply with facts, you have nothing else to say, and just try to diminish any other postings you can, because you know Racine is a weak link to the entire system and you are not the only one who is afraid of what is about to happen.
             </p>
             <p>
              You are AreWeSure can stalk and lie all you like, but you cannot stop the truth that is going to expose this entire system. What is your motive and connection to this anyway? Do you support pedos and corruption? Are you friends with Jimmy? Or you just love horses and horse farms? What is your objective? Why don't you review the information posted and read the news in Racine to find out what is going on for yourself from basic news sources. Notice anything unusual?
             </p>
             <p>
              Why are so many officials suddenly resigning? Why is the entire area a lawless cesspool where even the DA gets his own crimes covered up by other corrupt law enforcement? Why are judges suicided in the Root River? Why is money from Racine being laundered in the same place as revealed in Macron's email leaks? Racine has a history of pedo crimes, trafficking, satanic ritual abuse, and criminal corruption tied to secret societies and prominent people in the area. Racine is the birthplace of Sustainable Development and Community Policing, both directly tied to the Clintons. Racine is linked with Anthony Weiner and Chuck Schumer through the Knights of Pythias, and Racine is closely connected to the United Nations and Agenda 2030 through the Council on Foreign Relations, Trilateral Commission, and Bilderberg. These are just the tip of the iceberg of how Racine is connected.
             </p>
             <p>
              We know Jim Comey and Loretta Lynch are covering up criminal corruption linked to Pizzagate and the Clinton crime syndicate, and it links directly to Racine, Wisconsin and other hubs involved. It involves racketeering, fraud, blackmail, extortion, embezzlement, laundering, trafficking, murder and attempted murder, and other crimes. We have direct contacts with multiple victims and witnesses ready to testify to all of this who have been subjected to stalking, retaliation, slander, threats, burglaries, and attempted murder. This is not a game. This is not an anomaly. This is all directly connected.
             </p>
             <p>
              That is how we know what is going on in Racine, Wisconsin and how it connects to Pizzagate and Global Criminal Corruption -
 through direct experience that cannot be disputed by a paid shill or complicit horse lover.
             </p>
             <p>
              There is a prominent and extremely wealthy horse lover in Wisconsin who is involved in all of this, and who would be very worried about the truth getting out. Maybe you know them?

              <p>
               It is astonishing the amount of investigation that has gone on where links including direct evidence has been provided only to have others ask for links? Worse yet they simply cannot understand that in the beginning we provided reams of evidence only to have it deleted as fast as possible and some have been doxed &amp; threatened as a result.

               I am sure you have done exhaustive research on this subject being the scholars and experts that you are. Please explain to everyone who Macron is and what email information would possibly tie PedoGate &amp; Racine &amp; FBI &amp; CIA and many others together. Explain to everyone why the syncing of the blackberries involving Weiner/Abedin &amp; Clinton and 19 other co-conspirators have in common.

             Agree with you this has been well outlined by Webb. The blackberrys sync automatically with their corresponding system or "server"

             Anthony Weiner is no small player. He is deeply involved with Shumer &amp; others. There are at least 19 blackberries including Kerry's, Biden's, &amp; Obama's.

             Comey knows this. His Deputy Director McCabe knows it all and took $700,000 from Clinton crony Terry McCauliffe during investigation. "Then in secret meeting said, First we Fuck Flynn, then we Fuck Trump"

             about the pedophile scandal involving catholic priests sexually assaulting deaf children in a Catholic school for deaf &amp; disabled children that connected straight through to the Vatican.

            <p>
             Thought it might shed light on Wisconsin and focus everyone. Did you see the thread?

              What thread was that about the deaf school?  I vaguely remember it.  Also thanks for reminding me of Andy McCabe's wife running for office and McAuliffe donating to her campaign with the $700K.  Ha Ha, She lost.  More evidence of money laundering.  It never stops.
