            I believe there was a Military /Government cover up with McDonald. I also believe that this shit has been going on for so long, that it's hold isn't going to be broken unless they start prosecuting those at the top. We need to stop this!  We need to save the children and the moral fabric of our country. ( I personally don't think you need religion to have morals).  The CIA needs to be disbanded and no longer under Government protection. I think they are in the middle of everything that majorly stinks in America.

            NOW that I am "awake" I look at this case differently. There is a definite MK feel to the defense. Also, right in the HEART of the armed forces mess being uncovered. How many times have we heard of mkultra "missions"?

            Something smells fishy about this case.  It seems the witness that changed her mind is covering for someone.  Could it be someone that was on the Army Base at the time of the murders?  Someone maybe was having an affair with the wife and wanted revenge for something.  I remember this case (dating myself) and something didn't seem quite right then.  Still does not.
