<p>This was taken August 30th, 2019 - Thanks to our best &amp; proudest Rusty Shackleford, who has been uploading multiple times a week, day &amp; night, by air &amp; boat, scanning every inch of the island since Epstein was arrested, you can see on this day an older man with white hair in casual clothes, talking to what looks like a groundskeeper or crew member on a quad bike. They both spot the drone fairly innocuously, and the older man sits back in his vehicle to hide.</p>
<p>On that same day, one of Epstein\'s private jets (N120JE) made a flight from ATLANTA to CAYMAN ISLANDS, near USVI. The details &amp; history of his aircraft &amp; who it was sold to are examined in the above voat post by the amazing ORDO-TEMPLI-INTERNETIS. The jet in question is a 1988 Gulfstream Aerospace G-IV. FlightAware.com states it is <em>&quot;not available for public tracking per request from the owner/operator.&quot;</em>, but we can see unfiltered flight data via ADS-B Exchange that the most recent trip to the islands was taken September 2nd, 2019.</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>Personally I don\'t believe it\'s him in the photo. They are likely both staff members who work on maintaining the island <em>(of who\'s employment I don\'t know)</em> and the elder man simply happens to bear a resemblance to Epstein at a distance. It\'s also incredibly odd that he would appear outside, anywhere near open space knowing the attention on the island, were he really trying to hide his pitiful existence. Or maybe he\'s just that arrogant. Additional screencaps from the 4K backup show thusly:</p>

<p>If nothing else, this would at least help identify who the groundskeeper or prominent figures are on the island. Both men seem to have been recorded before from Rusty\'s boat, paired again, leaning on a jeep/golfcart on July 25th, when Epstein was supposedly in prison: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY2ionD65Cs">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY2ionD65Cs</a></p>

<p>I would say there have been up to ten employees seen at once on the island throughout the last few weeks, labouring, driving &amp; surrounding heavy building equipment. I saw four pool cleaners all working like normal, and a hedge trimmer/sweeper throwing a rock at the drone.

Rusty\'s also been increasingly intrusive lately &amp; learnt how to peep into open doorways to storage rooms by adjusting the lens setting to brighten darkened areas. I think this is amazing, so it\'s also an excuse to appreciate &amp; share his dedication. Not looking for credit, hope it\'s not irrelevant, just wanted everybody on the same page.</p>

             The time of day Rusty seems to dedicate to spying, probably a guy who works for a living. Maybe there's a window of access around 4:00 to get close with his boat / avoid security or sorts.

             Here's a list of flights from the start of July - I'm trying to convert depatures &amp; destinations to a column but I'm having trouble formatting, plus I'll have to mix different airport codes to be accurate, but something like:

             He or they have a strange destination in Wyoming a few times, but all the ones in remote Quebec &amp; Antarctica are actually faults, they blip up as errors from the scrambled GPS data and are technically impossible routes &amp; times. I'll try to update this later.

            !!! I was hoping someone would cross reference the flight tracker data with the other established JE "timelines", especially the one Rusty has been able to create with his consistent drone visits. While I am not sure it's Him in the footage either, this is the type of research that begins to build a real case out of our theories.
