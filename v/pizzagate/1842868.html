April 25th. Hhhmmm...</p>
<p>Mark Christopher Yantsos, 57, is facing charges of sexual abuse of a minor and a fourth-degree sex offense for sexual contact he allegedly had with a female student he met through the Rockville school. He is on administrative leave from the school.</p>
<p>Yantsos, a former New York Police Department officer who has worked in Montgomery County Public Schools since 2007, was released on a $75,000 bond April 10 on the condition of making no contact with the alleged victim. Since his release, he met with the girl at least six times and reportedly had sex with her once, according to court documents.</p>
