     There was a story I posted last year  after communicating with  one  of the  authors, who was  posted on  their homepage (i.e., their  list  of  contributing  authors), he  listed his personal  information  as  being a SATANIST; I found this  rather queer, coming  from  a  news group  who  is supposed to  be INVESTIGATING  among  other  things, satanism. This  author became upset  when  I emailed  him  and asked  him  about this. The short  story  is  TLAV said this  author parted  ways with  them, and no  longer worked for TLAV;  beyond that  the  owner/manager (who  emailed  me)  never really  explained  this, never  offered  any reason why a  satanist was  one  of their  contributing writers  in  the  first  place. I  found this  odd, and still  do.
    There  could  be some  reasons  why TLAV would 1. hire a  satanst 2. list that personal information on their website (surely they  knew this was  going to lead  to many  questions???)  3. this writer  may have some  benign philosophical  definition of &quot;satanism,&quot;  etc. (although  I personally   don\'t buy this explanation, I  think in  general  this  is a  cover,  to  present  satanism in  a  good &quot;light&quot; and a way to scout for initiates).
     But what is  odd is  the lack of  a  simple reasonable  explanation of the event,   If there  is a  benign factor  at work  here  a  simple, reasonable explanation would have answered  any general  questions.     <br />
      Voat investigators are the  first to vet  any news source, because we  know  many information sources (the  entire mainstream news, for  example) are  intimidated, black-balled,  infiltrated, corrupted and are  part of the CIA controlled  news network, and they  run  the  gamet from  full force in-your-face traitors and  spies like  CNN (who  should be publicly hung) to reporters  who  have  been  variously and  at  different times  and stories compromised (e.g., Jeff Rense, and I am  specifically referring to  the  Las  Vegas  False  Flag).

            Well, question answered, I guess. Any Luciferian will look down on the Satanists anyway.
