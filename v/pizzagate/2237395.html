            This lady is awesome. If I could give more upvotes to this I would. Clearly shoews how HRC was able to justify her laundering and shines a light on how corrupt small cities are too: White Bulger. In her other vids she speculates on the other Q anon questions such as who is REALLY running NK. And Q Anon is right. People would freak the f"&amp;*k out if they knew. Also, since I didn't know where to put this I think I found another thread. in this video,

             Tracy Beanz Q Anon Breakdown
            </a>
            Tracy Beanz is discussing Q Anons posts and shows a clip from Snowden the movie. The curious bit is the scene at 0:47 the charachter Gabriel Sol  describes himself as the 50 pound brain from the council of wizards and warlocks. The council of wizards and warlocks is MAGIC 12.

             Yes I saw the Beanz video. The council of wizards &amp; warlocks is Majestic 12 it seems...SnowWhite was Snowden and the CIA super commputers are the seven dwarfs.

            I wanted to know more about her daughter.  Denise touched me so deeply.  And it gives more insight into Scientology and how it is intertwined with our gov.  Clintons using the hit squad of Scientology/sure that would make sense.  I still recall the very public execution of Terry Schiavo paraded on the press day after day after day.  A satanic ritual murder broadcast for all to see/and let's not forget the very suspicious circumstanced that preceded Terry's condition.
           </p>
           <p>
            Here is her daughter's story/what I could find so far.
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             Each year brings more depth to the world's loss of this beautiful young woman. She did not commit suicide except in the most technical sense. There were people posing as her friends who harangued and pushed both her fiancé and her to their deaths. Several are members of my own family, who have enough influence to get away by hiding behind the ones who were actually there at her end. I posted the photo of Faith as Sojie in her uncle's lap in defiance of his statement to predators, before she died, that we were not related. The last place I saw my daughter was at his house and it was soon after that that several Massachusetts-based predators began actively stalking Sojie. They mistook her cousin for her at UMass.
            </p>
            <p>
             These predators are members of a strong Massachusetts-based cult that is deeply embedded in organized crime. My sister Renee is a member of that cult and began threatening Sojie and me from her infancy, even before her own son was charged in a double murder committed as part of graduation, the drowning of Barry Griffin and Richard Retzel in Laurel Lake in Lee Massachusetts. Charges against the seven defendants were changed to "conspiracy to commit manslaughter" and resulted in acquittal after many legal anomalies were accomplished by my family's co-operation with Renee's cult . I was sent an obituary of a murder victim while my daughter was still alive, in April of 2010, but could not charge the sender with "stalking" because of my family's role in hiring him. My brother James Matteau owes his political career to his acquiescense with Renee's long history of involvement with this cult, a cult that has successfully protected pedophiles and rapists in the Catholic Church and elsewhere in Berkshire County for years.
            </p>
            <p>
             When I last saw Faith she had been calling herself by this name instead of "Sojie" for several years and she had explained to me why she took the name. Because of the way I raised her, to be true to her own spiritual path no matter what the various bigots in our family thought, because they all identified Christianity with me (Renee believes fanatically, and erroneously, that the Catholic church is opposed to the kind of basic Bible faith I practiced at home.)
            </p>
            <p>
             Faith explained to me that she was forcing everyone who knew her to acknowledge her "Faith" every time they spoke to her, no matter what their opinions might be. She thought that the abuse she suffered all her life from her father, my relatives, and others in Massachusetts was due to the general hostility there for basic Christianity. I tried to persuade her that the only way she would be safe would be to leave Massachusetts completely because my family's cult, that organized crime and political cult, would never leave her alone, but she could not be persuaded.
            </p>
            <p>
             She was severely punished by her father, (who is psychotic and very easily manipulated) as well as by others around her who felt threatened anytime she showed positive connection with me, her mother. when she and her fiancé began to escape the control that cult had over their lives, and began to plan a more conventional life, they had to move against both of them. First against Myron, then against Faith.
            </p>
            <p>
             They even succeeded in erasing the "Matteau" part of her name from her gravestone. Her full legal name was Sojourner Margret Matteau Jackson.
            </p>
            <p>
             I came very close to opening an investigation recently. But Renee, in spite of being in her seventies, still has the network to manipulate justice in Massachusetts, and so that effort fell by the wayside, but that does not mean there will never be justice for Faith.
            </p>
            <p>
             There is no statute of limitations on murder. Those who killed Faith and Myron have likely killed others in similar ways. They may seek comfort in their own spiritual belief that if nothing is discovered in their own lifetimes, they have gotten away with these killings. I take comfort in my own faith that justice will prevail, regardless of who was paid, exchanged favors, or found political opportunities in co-operating with James Matteau and Renee Burke's fears of what might have happened if Faith and Myron had survived and made it to Texas to raise the children they wanted to have.
            </p>
            <p>
             That is why Faith was killed, after all. Her so-called friends knew that she was escaping their cult and several of them did Renee the favor she wanted, to make sure Faith would never grow wise.
            </p>
            <p>
             But Faith was already wise, and the saddest thing is, had she lived and made it to Texas, no one would have taken a second look at what Renee Burke, James Matteau, and the other members of that sick cabal did in the wake of those drownings in Laurel Lake.
            </p>
            <p>
             Even Barry Griffin, Sr., had forgiven my nephew for his part in the murder of his son, as he told me in 2004, because he knew someone else was driving those events in the early 1980's. Renee was in charge of all the maneuverings and suppressions in that trial while she was part of GE management, and Griffin was an important union steward who could have exposed her role in the disposal of PCB's. He did not know what I knew, that Renee (Lorene) Burke had long used a "back door" in GE's main computer system to hide finances for a number of Massachusetts lawyers, politicians, and other businessmen. Andrea Nucifaro was one. But I did know that, because she wanted me to use her services through that same computer when I was opening a small business in Lenox at the time.
            </p>
            <p>
             There are many witnesses and documents to prove that Faith Jackson was the unfortunate innocent victim of the same "cult" that drowned Barry Griffin Jr and Richard Retzel so many years ago.
            </p>
            <p>
             It is a sad fact that her death is very similar to the deaths of any number of innocent people who don't even know that a group in Massachusetts, a vicious cult, has taken crime beyond petty selfish concerns and into the spiritual realm to the point that the very existence of innocence is, itself, a new crime.
            </p>
            <p>
             But Faith never died, Faith lives on, and in the end, Faith will win.
            </p>
