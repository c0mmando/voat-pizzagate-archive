            justtellus. Great idea. Someone should do a piece simply on Tamera Luzzatto. Who is she? Background if possible. Close connections to Clinton and Podesta. Strange emails, followed by research into her on-line life, northern Virginia goings-on, leading to the conclusion that she pimps babies!  Seems like a nice, self-contained journalistic piece.

            How to overcome that conspiracy and nullify that protection, isn't that really the point of the proposed ad campaign?  I imagine that Mrs Clinton would have preferred to ignore the revelation of her private server.  She felt she had to attempt to explain it away (as a convenience, remember) only because (1) she was already so prominent that the revelation had to be widely reported by MSM and (2) the revelation itself was so obviously odd and possibly serious to so many as to force intensifying follow-up if it could not be explained away very quickly.  "Convenience" didn't fly, the public curiosity was in play and matters progressed.  Here, we have the bizarre and possibly serious revelations but not the wide reporting that created the irresistible popular pressure for explanation that puts matters to rest or forces intensifying pursuit.

            Those kids are 7, 9, and 11 months old, not years.  Have you not seen "Evies Blog"? Make sure to read the words at the top. “Evelyn is growing up. Soon she will be the queen of the entire US of A. right now, for a limited time only, you can spend some time with her online, raw and uncut. Take advantage of this now, as in the future she will have the power of life and death over you.”

            I disagree.  Any reasonable person who sees this info packaged like this for the first time will likewise be curious.  Why not tell them?  Why not tell them and make it go away... and any person who sees beyond the innocence will suspect something is going on... The normies are not normies they are brain captives of mass media.... FBI is doing stuff right now that the normies would agree with if they reported it in the news.  Lets report that all that we can.  When the big one goes down we want all the Pizzagate experts we can get together and up to speed that we can at that time to hit the field filling in the blanks for these folks freaking out when the matrix goes down... many of them will need hours and hours of "Therapy" to come around.  So Forget the zombies for now, we need all receptive folks to realize this is still a thing that has exploded in scope and we need them on board.     The zombies just need to see it as well, on board or not so they are primed for the SHTF
