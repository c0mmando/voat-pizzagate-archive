            I don't like Pence.  He is a carbon copy of Hillary and Kaine.  That is why they want Trump out.  I keep telling this to my friends but they are deaf as can be. I think your comparison is on target.

And was hired by some money guy who wants Chief "pedo" Newsham head of DC Comet Police to be Comey's role in F.B.I.?!  What the fuck is going on!!!  I am seeing maybe 2 warring deep states?! I can't keep track of wtf!!

            Yes, and what a perfect storm that would have been/be.  Right now we have Trudeau and Macron  and we would have added HRC to that toxic stew.  So they think Pence is on their side? I am wondering....about him.

            Unfortunately, I think the answer to your questions is, "I really wish I could tell you, but I can't in this forum, cause it's classified.  You know, for national security reasons."
           </p>
           <p>
            PS-  The shills are particularly cruel and ridiculous in this thread.  Just reading their comments is emotional brain damage.  I hope everyone remembers to ignore/block/delete, because they are here to piss us off ON PURPOSE.  Which means you must have struck a nerve.

             Apparently rumor on 4chan was there are people inside DCPD who are about to spill the beans. One is someone who has been involved in the many crimes committed by DCPD but he apparently has had some kind of spiritual awakening and is now red pilling other officers who were not apart of the crimes so that they know what's been going on. Hard to say what's true. But thought I'd share.
            </p>
            <p>
             Edit to add: the person reporting this info said he had spoken w one of the DC cops who HAD seen a video of shooting. The video he saw wasn't clear enough to ID suspect, but it was very clear that it was a hit and not a robbery.

            Seth Rich was killed on July 10 early morning.  On July 12 afternoon, three men were captured in DC after a police chase.  The men were firing a machine gun at police.  This site ties the two together.

            It says that the feds were tipped off and using a tracking device to find the suspects.  I am wondering if they were set up to be captured, after they did Hillary's dirty work.  NO names were given for the suspects.
           </p>
           <p>
            Anyway, I know many find the linked website fake news, but this could be an important lead.  If we could get the names and see if they have any SEIU connections.

            It is impressive how covert their actions against George Webb are.  They think they are sneaky, but "those conspiritards on voat" are actually some of the most professional and intelligent people on earth are here working for the good of humanity.

            As I sit here enjoying my Starbuck's latte, I take a deep breath and smile. I smile because, as others have stated, Drumpf is being impeached and Voat looks to be on its last leg. Where oh where will you conspiracy theorists go now? Haw haw haw. Pizzagate is fake news and fake news hurts real people.

            Haha. We true Americans knew this day would come. Drumpf will be impeached. Voat will end up closing. No place for more pizzagate conspiracy theories to be spun. I relish your snowflake tears! #IMWITHER #NOWALLNOBAN #RESIST #BLACKLIVESMATTER #CHELSEA/THEROCK2020 #GAYPRIDE

             LOL....you know what happens when you take the peoples voice away?  Ever hear of confirmational bias?  It makes you all look dirty as fuck.  It destroyed the Cannibal Queen and it will destroy you MKULTRA kiddie fucking Pedos.  It will lead all the way to the Jewish Masonic Cabal.  And we have a powerful tool now to root you bastards out now.  DNA.  You fuckers are so proud of your genetics well it will be a road map to catch all of you.  Exile will be your fate if your lucky.  If your true crimes get to become common knowledge then a fate worse than what Rome did will be your fate.  And you know it.  You played this as an win everything or lose everything game.  So get ready bitches because doom awaits one or another of our causes.  And you dont have the numbers.  And the Goyim puppet dogs in the Police and Military are dwarfed by the ones who are waking up.  So......people.......ride to the sound of the guns.

            That's an excellent point. We need to list the ways the way the crimes were treated differently and shame them into explaining their actions. And maybe turn over all info to Sharyl Atkinsson

            2 things have always bugged me about the time line that night.  Im about Seth Rich's age and have a similar background I guess u could say.  1...i dont care how drunk u are....a 3 HOUR walk home from the bar is insane. Not buying it.  2- I go out alot late on weekend...and I have a great relationship with my parents....I talk to my dad almost every day. I have never called him at 1:30am...and would never unless it was a serious emergency. I'm almost wondering if he was taken somewhere, brought back to the area near his house then killled. I dunno....does not add up.

            <p>
             Good point.  I had wondered too if he spent time with someone in the interim of over 2 HOURS to kill time. (Supposedly it's a 30 min walk from bar to house).  Newsweek cited relationship problems...but no sources to clarify whether they actually spoke to someone or are just making up stuff.  If there were relationship problems due to not having enough time together, why not spend the evening of the 9th with his girlfriend (assuming she could have) instead of going out? (okay maybe an argument, but again why call his Dad?)
            </p>
            <p>
             And now another (new to me) report of the last minutes: "Joel Rich also revealed that his son's girlfriend was on the phone with Seth just moments before he was killed.
"She heard some voices or something. She asked 'are you home?' He said, 'yeah, I'm a block away, I'm home' and he said 'I have to go' and put the phone back in his pocket and two minutes later he was shot," Joel Rich said somberly. "What happened in those two minutes we would love to know."

             So if he's out walking at after 4:00am through a neighborhood with a lot of armed robberies in the past days, and someone approaches him...he says "I have to go."  IMO That indicates to me he didn't think who ever it was would be threat to him, otherwise he would keep his girlfriend on the line, say 'hey there's something up with some strange people'...

             The article also names Republican lobbyist Jack Burkman as putting up $100,000 reward. (A Jeb Bush supporter)
            </p>
            <p>
             Apparently the thing with Jack Burkman and how he fits into my growing theory that perhaps Seth Rich's death had more to do with the Neocon side of the DC Corruption wheelhouse just keeps expanding...needs a new thread possibly. (Remember, they never thought Hillary would lose).

             Burkman conveniently helps Dems with the Fake Russia did it story:
            </p>
            <p>
             "Republican lobbyist says murder of DNC staffer Seth Rich linked to Russian operatives"  "..."I was approached by a guy who styles himself as a former U.S. intel officer," Burkman said. "I quizzed him. I think he's credible - you never know the motive of people. "
            </p>
            <p>
             'I quizzed him'...Yeah right dude.

             A Notorious Washington Lobbyist Wants To Raise Money For Trump
            </p>
            <p>
             Burkman will host what he calls “The First General Election Fundraiser for Donald J. Trump for President” on June 1. He hopes to raise as much as $300,000.
            </p>
            <p>
             When it comes to Burkman’s support of Trump, skepticism seems warranted. Burkman, after all, supported Jeb Bush early in the Republican primary — a candidate whose humiliation at the hands of Trump was so severe that Bush refuses to back him. Burkman even took out a full-page ad in the Los Angeles Daily News calling Trump a joke.
            </p>
            <p>
             Burkman has a penchant for pursuing headlines with as much vigor as he chases clients. He is, among other things, infamous for spearheading a quixotic congressional effort to ban gay players from the NFL — a campaign made even odder by the facts that, one, his own brother is gay, and, two, lobbyists don’t get to openly introduce legislation."
            </p>
            <p>
             "Apparently, enough people are of the same mindset to form a minyan. Burkman said he expects 150 to 200 government affairs professionals and about 100 defense contractors for his soiree. Ralph Palmieri, a defense contractor (formerly of Lockheed and Sytex), was one name Burkman’s spokesman sent as proof that others were indeed attending. Palmieri didn’t immediately return a request for comment. "

             BINGO.     We don't know for sure because the police have NEVER released the data proving that Seth was on his phone during the time he left the bar and was shot?   Of course, it might be true but no actual facts from the police

             The first post from the anon claiming to have been a 4th year surgical resident on trauma duty and scrubbed in on the surgery sounds highly credible. If he's telling the truth then obviously the police report as posted elsewhere on this MB is fraudulent and a coverup of an unsuccessful attempted murder that may have been completed in the ICU on a patient who likely would have recovered from his 2 gunshot wounds. This would be even more nefarious and would implicate the hospital in the coverup, IMO.

             When was there EVER a revolutionary kind of uprise, when people are too fat, their refrigerators filled and the homes are warm?
ALL the kinds of "protests" of saturated people have one thing in common: a government or money masters are pulling the strings to get the sheep on the street!
Without that, fat, saturated people do NOTHING. Because they do not care enough.
They give a sh.t about #pizzagate #pedogate.
Humans are sheep. The bible knows it...

              Yeah, it would be only the Trumpsters of course, and even they would have to break away from whatever particular brand of bread and circuses they enjoy. Besides, people are rushed off their feet and slammed for time thanks to usury and taxation and regulation via their overlords the money masters, sadly.

            I would like a few answers on this Joe Capone.  Why was Seth wobbly when leaving the bar?  He drank a usual amount but seemed more drunk.  Was anything added to his drink?  Was there a tox screen at the hospital? Why was Capone at the White House days before? Is he a member of SEIU? (Anon tip)  How long has he owned the bar? How did he get his money to lease or buy expensive NW real estate?

            For a GSW in DC, you will have only 2 options - Howard University and GW Hospital.  Given the location and nature of the shooting, I would say 90%+ that Rich would have been taken to GW.

            1). After he left bar and before he was shot where was he? Why haven't the police released data on phone calls, cameras etc that would have tracked him.
           </p>
           <p>
            Don't have the link off hand but recall just reading that he left the bar about 1:15? am...walked home.  Must have been a long walk because it was at least 2 hours later (either 3:17 or 4:17am) that he told his girlfriend not to worry he was just 'steps' away from his home.  Then she heard the sounds of other people, etc.
           </p>
           <p>
            If this was a premeditated murder, it seems plausible that the people were waiting for him near his home.

            "Rich had been at Lou’s City Bar a couple of miles from his home until about 1:15 a.m. He walked home, calling several people along the way. He called his father, Joel Rich, who he missed because he had gone to
sleep. He talked with a fraternity brother and his girlfriend, Kelsey Mulka.
 
Around 4:17 a.m., Rich was about a block from his home when Mulka, still on the phone with him, heard voices in the background. Rich reassured her that he was steps away from being at his front door and hung up.
 
Two minutes later, Rich was shot twice. Police were on the scene within three minutes. Rich sustained bruising on his hands and face. He remained conscious, but died at a nearby hospital less than two hours later."

            reports that Seth Rich left the bar at 2:30 a.m.'
"It was closing time at Lou’s City Bar when Seth Rich drained the last of his Bell’s Two Hearted Ales and started walking into the muggy night in a trendy neighborhood of northwest Washington, D.C. At 2:30 a.m. on July 10."
           </p>
           <p>
            This appears to be inaccurate, as Lou's City Bar in Columbia Heights closed at 1:45 am, unless he had ordered a final beer at closing and nursed it for 45 min.
           </p>
           <p>
            <a href="http://www.fox5dc.com/news/local-news/193631067-story">

            </a>
            "Rich’s walk home from Columbia Heights to his home in the Bloomingdale neighborhood would have roughly taken him 30 minutes. Rich was fatally shot as he was on the phone with his girlfriend at about 4:20 a.m. What happened from when he left Lou's City Bar or The Wonderland Ballroom to when he was gunned down remains unclear."
           </p>
           <p>
            The Newsweek article played up crime in the area: "The cops suspected Rich was a victim of an attempted robbery, one of many that plague the neighborhood. Strangely, however, they found his wallet, credit cards and cellphone on his body. The band of his wristwatch was torn but not broken."
           </p>
           <p>
            The Aug 18th Fox5 reported it this way: "Right now, sources said police still believe Rich’s death was a robbery gone wrong and they have no evidence his death was related to his job.
           </p>
           <p>
            Police sources close to the investigation also said that there have been seven arrests linked to armed robberies in the Bloomingdale neighborhood that happened just days before Rich was killed. Those arrests were made after the murder and there were three guns that were recovered after the apprehension.
           </p>
           <p>
            However, none of those guns have matched with the ballistics in Rich's murder."
           </p>
           <p>
            So Seth Rich walked calmly home, late at night, through a neighborhood plagued with armed robberies?  That sounds odd to me.
           </p>
           <p>
            Anyway...in the Fox5 account they refer to this "What happened from when he left Lou's City Bar or The Wonderland Ballroom to when he was gunned down remains unclear.
Here is the event going on July 9 at The Wonderland Ballroom: (shows a half naked woman but no 'nudity')

            If Seth's girlfriend was talking to him just before he would have reached home, I'd imagine he would have told her where he was for over 2 hours prior to that.

             It is also highly suspect that Hilary Clinton in real time on the campaign trail at a rally would know about a specific murder in Washington specifically the name of the victim and details she nor anyone would have access to at the time. She stated in real time the name Seth Rich on stage.

             <p>
              DNC Chair Debbie Wasserman Schultz issued a statement on Monday mourning the death of Rich, who worked as voter expansion data director.
“Our hearts are broken with the loss of one of our DNC family members over the weekend. Seth Rich was a dedicated, selfless public servant who worked tirelessly to protect the most sacred right we share as Americans – the right to vote," she said. "He saw the great potential of our nation and believed that, together, we can make the world a better place."
             </p>
             <p>
              and Hillary wouldn't want to waste a chance at pushing gun control:
             </p>
             <p>
              "Hillary Clinton spoke about Rich on Tuesday morning, amid remarks in New Hamphire on gun violence.
"Just this past Sunday, a young man, Seth Rich -- who worked for the Democratic National Committee, to expand voting rights -- was shot and killed in his neighborhood in Washington. He was just 27 years old," she said. "Surely we can agree that weapons of war have no place on the streets of America."
             </p>
             <p>
              Wait a second...'weapons of war'?  What kind of gun did they use?

              Isn't it odd that the DNC didn't pony up reward money to help track down who killed their "DNC family member" but Republican Lobbyist Jeb Bush supporter Jack Burkman offered $100,000...then $105,000...then $130,000... ?

             <p>
              She was on stage?   So these means it was during a campaign during the day or several hours after he died.  By that point his family, friends and coworkers would have known of his death.

             <p>
              You think it's odd that a Democrat running for President would mention a DNC worker who was murdered?    Hell folks in her campaign were recruiting the guy to work for them didn't they?

            YES. We have to push for answers regarding Seth Rich. Did y'all see this? Debunked.

            Law enforcement has to be held accountable here. It's in the computer or it's not.

            I am very hopeful the truth can come out here-- and fast.

             I have had about enough of the MSM idiots.  Fox this Fox that, Fox says something but do they have the source person on to verify.  Salon and Wald are on the MSM Payroll.  There IS a laptop and someone took it and has it under lock and key. One of the things they mentioned was that the parents debunked it as well, The parents are getting their talking points from a hand picked spokesman by the DNC.  I agree with you that the news will come out-if we continue to keep digging.  We evidently are they only ones that Seth and his parents can depend on.

             Agreed, but we need to actually fight back.   Everyone spread this.  Post and link where you posted it.  Has 4chan been blocked because they tried to find the hospital?    Have all the hospitals just now been put under a gag order???

             You can't prove that yet.     What we need to do now is put the pressure on the police to start answering some very BASIC questions.    See my last update if GW is right all the hospitals near the shooting have been GAGGED.

            I have to agree with you. Seth Rich is the way to get them - and then everything will come out. Officer Robinson's sister worked for Killary, and Podesta taught his class - small world!

             I'd like to think that Seth opens the portal, but we thought that too of Weiners laptop.
            </p>
            <p>
             The problem here that i keep butting up against is that people dont believe without total undeniable evidence - especially in todays world where the media and govt propaganda have eviscerated the general population's standards of evidence and capacity for critical thinking
            </p>
            <p>
             so the only kind of evidence that will mass-red-pill would be , like, a high res video of hillary raping and murdering a child - but ITS ILLEGAL TO SHOW such evidence
            </p>
            <p>
             so in that sense they really have us by the balls.

             Maybe Trump needs to write an executive order of a one time limited exemption to showing/distributing , &amp; show the world what he is fighting against

               It's quite simple. Had Seth Rich been a random victim in this posh DC neighborhood, HRC would have used that as her cause celeb for talking about gun control. They would have created some fund in his name, paraded his parents around during the election ect. Instead, they have literally acted like it never happened.

            Many of your questions were already answered. While he was breathing, he certainly was not able to 'be on his phone' at the hospital. The real key, is his girlfriend who was on the phone with him, when it happened. I saw a timeline in a thread just as you wished to see here. I'll look for it.

             Many ??? were answered.   You know what condition he was in when the police showed up?  Did they call an ambulance?  Where is a log of that call.  How longe before ambulance showed up?  What hospital did they take him?  Did EMT call hospital with heads up?  Where are the EMT logs.   and so on and so on.
            </p>

             Guys we need to raise this with Hannity and all those in the media covering this.  Get Them to ask the questions. Put the spotlight on the police?   If Hannity etc start asking ?? maybe people will start talking.  His roomates, people who lived on the street he was shot, doctors etc at the hospital and so on.

              Hannity was talking about this all day, tonight he's gonna do the same, says he has a big story. He gave out a lot of great info today and said that Seth Rich was for sure the leaker like Assange hinted. Hannity is saying Rich was murdered, implying nefarious activity. Wonder if he'll (Sean) get taken off the air.

              Seth Rich was shot twice in the back on the 2100 block of Flagler and might have been taken to Howard University Hospita which was about 3 blocks away.   He was on his phone with his GF and told her not to worry.  I think that meant he recognized his attacker/s.  There is other info in here as to the name of an Acting Captain and at the bottom is info (if still active) on how to contact with info.  Reading this all over again, even though it has been close to a year, does not make it any easier. Seth Rich RIP  We will find them.

               This wasn't a robbery gone amuck. To be shot twice in  back was a murder with the intent to silence him. The killers wanted to be sure he was dead to shoot twice. A robber will shoot to disable someone from interfering with robbery or to prevent the victim from identifyig the culprit. Here it appears Seth was shot before having an opportunity to identfy his would be assailants.

                I agree and I think he knew them.  That is why when his GF sounded concerned, he said not to worry.  So it was a policeman which would not frighten him, or it was someone from the DNC or maybe as we have talked about, a SEIU janitor, one he might have recognized from work?  There was a post on here that said Lou's City Bar was very near CPP which would make it close to Dupont Circle.  Well SEIU HQ is right next to Dupont Circle and the tunnels are underneath. Yeah, what robber is going to leave about $2K worth of loot behind?

            I know my few Twitter followers are sick of me tweeting #SethRich and #SethRichCoverUp. Twitter stopped it from trending. Everytime it is retweeted it puts one more drop of pressure on them. I agree, questions need to be asked, and the pressure cannot let up.

            MSM is desperately trying to gaslight the masses and memory hole this story, of course (what other choice do those crooks have?). They will fail. HIS NAME WAS SETH RICH.

             I have a feeling there is a huge false flag coming if we keep this up, for they will be getting desperate.  If we keep pushing and pushing and do not let up they will be backed into a corner.  This morning I heard that the son of Osama is threatening lone wolf actions.  They are setting it up, imo.

              Look... I keep saying it, there will be no major false flags on domestic soil as long as Trump is President.

             <p>
              Why, you ask?  A: The Executive Branch must be involved in major false flag attacks to provide cover and lack of inquiry.

               Wrong. The Deep State decides where and when. Trump is a puppet he will believe it's a real terror attack and his deep state advisers will urge him to act Presidential "this is your chance Mr. President to be seen as a courageous heroic leader" and Trump will do what Bush did after Cheney arranged 9/11 same thing will happen. Trump will be praised but it will only be temporary if they can't get him impeached "for his Russian collusion" then Trump will be rubbed  out bumped off assassinated he might even be taken out on his foreign trip this weekend it would be easy to kill him in Israel or Saudi Arabia

               You bring up a good point.  Let's hope we are right about him.  From what I see so far, I hope he stays away from the BO false flags.  That was the Obama Trademark.  I think he created more false flags than any other Pres., mostly because he had HRC as SOS.

              We saw a slew of false flags in London and Sweden (all staged), now to burry pedogate they will use another Islamic boogieman. Look for the military drills - drill provides cover for the real event (like on 9-11, Pentagon was holding military exercise called Vigilant worrior duplicating exact same scenario). Look for anything odd. They might be planning something.

              I read a theory somewhere that the reason Deep State was so pissed about the "intelligence leaked to Russians" is because it was a false flag they were planning with airplanes and Trump just botched their plans. Who knows.
