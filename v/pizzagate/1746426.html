It shows how the Clinton State Department approved a sex trafficker\'s entry into its &quot;Summer Work Travel Program&quot; in order to get J-1 Visas for his victims. </p>
<p>The trafficker, Jeffrey Jason Cooper, was sentenced to 30 years in prison on Friday for sex trafficking crimes committed from June to August 2011 (<a href="https://www.nbcmiami.com/news/local/Miami-Beach-Man-Convicted-in-Sex-Trafficking-Scheme-That-Targeted-Foreign-Students-401984885.html">https://www.nbcmiami.com/news/local/Miami-Beach-Man-Convicted-in-Sex-Trafficking-Scheme-That-Targeted-Foreign-Students-401984885.html)</a>). </p>
<p>I will post the body of the Reddit post below, but I think there\'s a problem with some of their research. They try to link the program approval to Evan Ryan, who ran the summer work travel program as Assistant Secretary of State for Educational and Cultural Affairs. Evan Ryan &amp; her husband Tony Blinkin have ties to Joe Biden (Evan previously worked for him) and John Podesta (Wikileaks email showing them having dinner with him in 2015 - <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170325211211/https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/44146">https://web.archive.org/web/20170325211211/https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/44146)</a>). However, Evan did not become AS until 2013, and Cooper\'s sex trafficking scheme happened during 2011. The person in charge of the program at that time was Ann Stock, an Obama appointee who previously had worked for Bill Clinton as White House Social Secretary from 1993-1997 (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ann_Stock">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ann_Stock)</a>). </p>
<p>So, while I believe the OP\'s conclusion was wrong, the research still ties the Clinton State Department to the approval of sex trafficking using the Summer Work Travel program.</p>
<p>Full text of Reddit post:</p>
<p><a href="https://voat.co/user/ninjakick666">/u/ninjakick666</a> posted this press release from the DOJ earlier</p>
<p><a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/miami-beach-sex-trafficker-sentenced-30-years-prison">https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/miami-beach-sex-trafficker-sentenced-30-years-prison</a></p>
<p>What stood out to me is that the trafficker used the State Departments Summer Work Travel Program to get his victims J-1 Visas.</p>
<p>You have to apply to be an employer with this program</p>
<p><a href="https://j1visa.state.gov/hosts-and-employers/employers/">https://j1visa.state.gov/hosts-and-employers/employers/</a></p>
<p>You also need a program sponsor, being a sponsor also requires an application</p>
<p><a href="https://j1visa.state.gov/sponsors/become-a-sponsor/how-to-apply/">https://j1visa.state.gov/sponsors/become-a-sponsor/how-to-apply/</a></p>
<p>So this is where things get fucky</p>
<pre><code>In addition to defrauding the students, Cooper fraudulently induced an educational exchange agency to sponsor the victims’ visas, and caused government officials to issue the victims temporary, non-immigrant “J-1” visas based on Cooper’s false and fraudulent offer of legitimate summer jobs.
</code></pre>

<p>Seems like they are trying to shift the blame away from the State Dept on this one. Shouldn\'t it be on the State Dept to verify applications and their legitimacy to protect the students participating in the program? They say they won\'t even consider you unless you can put up experience and money. I guess they don\'t look into the legitimacy of experience at all then seeing as this guy got through no problem.</p>
<pre><code>Important to Note: Designation as an Exchange Visitor Program sponsor will not be considered if an applicant cannot meet the following two prerequisites that are discussed in detail in the Temporary Users Manual:

Previous experience in the field of international exchanges; and,

Financial requirements.
</code></pre>

<p>Here\'s a list of current sponsors. Disney is probably the most recognizable on the list</p>
<p><a href="https://j1visa.state.gov/participants/how-to-apply/sponsor-search/?program=Summer%20Work%20Travel">https://j1visa.state.gov/participants/how-to-apply/sponsor-search/?program=Summer%20Work%20Travel</a></p>
<p>So who on Earth would grant this guy, a sex trafficker portraying an exchange agency owner, approval for the program? Evan Ryan would!</p>
<p><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evan_Ryan">https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evan_Ryan</a></p>
<p>She ran the program for the last few years as Assistant Secretary of State for Educational and Cultural Affairs</p>
<p><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assistant_Secretary_of_State_for_Educational_and_Cultural_Affairs">https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assistant_Secretary_of_State_for_Educational_and_Cultural_Affairs</a></p>
<p>So who is she?</p>
<pre><code>Prior to becoming Assistant Secretary of State, she served as the assistant for intergovernmental affairs and public liaison for Joe Biden, Vice President of the United States.
</code></pre>

<p>Huh interesting. She\'s also married to Tony Blinken</p>
<p><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tony_Blinken">https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tony_Blinken</a></p>
<p>Blinken has quite the resume</p>
<p>From being Obama\'s deputy national security advisor, to national security advisor to Biden and then, the Deputy sec of State he\'s had quite the bureaucratic career</p>
<p>Blinken has been involved with CSIS</p>
<p><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Center_for_Strategic_and_International_Studies">https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Center_for_Strategic_and_International_Studies</a></p>
<p>and the Senate committee on foreign relations</p>
<p>Centre for Strategic and International Studies is interesting. They are a think tank</p>
<pre><code>The center conducts policy studies and strategic analyses of political, economic and security issues throughout the world, with a specific focus on issues concerning international relations, trade, technology, finance, energy and geostrategy.
</code></pre>

<p><a href="https://wikispooks.com/wiki/Center_for_Strategic_and_International_Studies">https://wikispooks.com/wiki/Center_for_Strategic_and_International_Studies</a></p>
<p>The likes of Kissinger to McCain have been involved with them. And they are no strangers to the CIA</p>
<pre><code>CSIS provided propaganda materials used by the CIA to destabilise the Government of Chile in the run up to the 1973 coup.
</code></pre>

<p>One of their main guys is David Abshire. The man Reagan brought in to &quot;restore the confidence of the nation in the Reagan presidency&quot; after Iran Contra <a href="https://wikispooks.com/wiki/David_Abshire">https://wikispooks.com/wiki/David_Abshire</a></p>
<p>These guys are the board of trustees</p>
<p><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Kissinger">https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Kissinger</a> it\'s Kissinger need I say more?</p>
<p><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zbigniew_Brzezinski">https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zbigniew_Brzezinski</a> Former national sec advisor to Jimmy Carter</p>
<p><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Cohen">https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Cohen</a> Former Sec of Defense under Clinton</p>
<p><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Argyros">https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Argyros</a> Billionaire and former ambassador</p>
<p><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brent_Scowcroft">https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brent_Scowcroft</a> Former National security advisor to both Ford and captain CIA himself HW Bush</p>
<p>So as you can see these are the big boys in national security and foreign affairs.</p>
<p>So Evan Ryan, an Obama era bureaucrat, who is married to another obama era bureaucrat that has been involved heavily with national security and the intelligence community as well as a foreign policy think tank that many big names like Kissinger are involved with, was running this program and under her they approved this guy to be part of their Summer Work Travel Program. Interesting. And it\'s not like this guy was running a highly sophisticated operation. He got busted for working out of his apartment and the neighbours noticed things were a little off. At the very least we\'ve got major incompetence and negligence on the part of the State Department that led to these girls being trafficked for sex. The question is how aware was the State Dept about this guy, his legitimacy, and his intentions? Interesting questions if you ask me.</p>

           So Evan Ryan, an Obama era bureaucrat, who is married to another obama era bureaucrat that has been involved heavily with national security and the intelligence community as well as a foreign policy think tank that many big names like Kissinger are involved with, was running this program and under her they approved this guy to be part of their Summer Work Travel Program. Interesting. And it's not like this guy was running a highly sophisticated operation. He got busted for working out of his apartment and the neighbours noticed things were a little off. At the very least we've got major incompetence and negligence on the part of the State Department that led to these girls being trafficked for sex. The question is how aware was the State Dept about this guy, his legitimacy, and his intentions? Interesting questions if you ask me.
