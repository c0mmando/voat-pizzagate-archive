<p>The next product is the <a href="https://twitter.com/amazon/status/923272958055014400">Amazon Cloud Cam</a>, which is described as &quot;an intelligent security camera that works with Alexa.&quot; Some of the features are listed below:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>
24/7 monitoring </li>
<li>
Notifications - Get notified when Cloud Cam sees activity and use the Cloud Cam App to check in anytime with live view. </li>
<li>
See clearly in the dark - Night vision lets you detect what’s happening around the clock.</li>
<li>
Cloud Cam’s intelligence lives in the cloud so it is always getting smarter with more advanced alerts, detection, and features. </li>
<li>
Amazon Key compatible version – With the Cloud Cam (Key Edition) and a compatible smart lock, eligible Prime members can watch their in-home package delivery live or later. </li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>This is the most lazily hidden spyware I have ever seen. It is always getting smarter? Paired with Amazon Key? 24/7? When you consider <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2014/07/the-details-about-the-cias-deal-with-amazon/374632/">Jeff Bezos\' connection to the CIA</a> (the owner of Amazon) in which the CIA payed $600 million to use the cloud-based surveillance, it becomes obvious what the goal of this technology is. This also ties in nicely with the next item.</p>
<hr />
<p>I saved the worst until last. With the help of <a href="https://voat.co/user/carmencita">@carmencita</a>, I discovered that Amazon have already gained the trust of the gullible as they brought out the <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/curtissilver/2017/04/27/amazon-echo-look-ushers-in-a-new-disturbing-era-of-privacy-concerns/#538d0d484303">Echo Look</a>. The idea of the Echo Look is to keep it in your wardrobe or on a wall and use it to refine your outfit for the day. The problem with this is that it also is kept on 24/7, so it can watch you change clothes if someone were to be using it to spy on the consumer. Again, this is a cloud-based service, so it is the same technology that the CIA paid for. This is an outright destruction of privacy, and what would the CIA want to pay for that anyway? I would add that surveillance doesn\'t discriminate by age.</p>
<hr />
<p>On a slightly unrelated note, I thought that I may as well include a direct link between Jeff Bezos and a known pedophile. <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/pr/wp/2017/02/23/john-podesta-joins-the-washington-post-as-a-contributing-columnist/">Here</a> is an article explaining that John Podesta has been hired by the Washington Post (which Bezos owns) as a columnist. I\'m <em>sure</em> that is reliable news.</p>

<hr />
<p>It seems fairly clear to me that Amazon is using technology to spy on consumers and have made it conveniently far too easy to abduct children for it to be merely a coincidence. I would appreciate your 2 cents on the matter though - time to get digging.</p>

            Whoa ! With the spying capabilities we know they use and then the ones we don't know about .. there should have never been a case they couldn't solve ! The more I think about how these swine operate the clearer it is to me that everything they do for the " good " is the exact opposite ! Spy technology's to help us stay safe? No ! It's to make it easier for them to violate us . In their eyes , What's good is bad and what's bad is good.

            Basically Amazon is dangerous to the entire household of any customer. Theoretically, anyone can hack the system and gain entry to the home. Plus amazon can hire a hitman to break into your house and not be liable because their records show that someone in the household signed up for key service. They get rid of the patsy, and are completely immune to repercussions.

            I really hope people are smarter than to fall for having this shit in their home.  Okay, we live in an age where technology is constantly expanding, but this is an invasion, not the next cool thing.   whoever is sick enough to have these stupid gadgets in their home deserves what they get.

            This is part of the Great Agenda that leads to Global Enslavement and the Mark of the Beast enforced by AI and Community Policing.
           </p>
           <p>
            We know this is real. We know where the "root" of the entire system is. Amazon recently built a plant in the Racine, near where Foxconn is building a huge facility and using eminent domain to take people's homes away, and Amazon may locate another GQ in nearby Chicago.
           </p>
           <p>
            This is about control, and giving up control to AI and unaccountable, faceless and corrupt corporations.
           </p>
           <p>
            There is a coalition involved, including Amazon, Google, Microsoft, Apple, Foxconn, HTC, Samsung, Tesla, Epic Systems, and many others. They are tied to the same groups as the Clinton Foundation, McCain Institute and many government agencies and educational institutions.
           </p>
           <p>
            Those who control these corporations are part of the same networks that control religious groups, service organizations, and secret societies.
           </p>
           <p>
            The problem is how pervasive both the criminal corruption and the complicity have become. There is no justice in our broken and corrupt system. The only answer is for the world to understand the Truth and the real agenda before it is too late.
           </p>
           <p>
            The world needs to identify and dismantle the real Terrorist groups - Pilgrims Society, Committee of 300, Council of 13 and the many interwoven groups in their pyramid of control.
           </p>
           <p>
            The "root" of the entire network and the real Agenda beyond Agenda 2030 is in Racine, Wisconsin.

              Thank you and be assured that we would not be posting anything if it were not the Truth. This is very real and very dangerous. Many others have died and had their lives ruined to find out what we know. We exhausted all legal measures up to Loretta Lynch and Jim Comey directly, and have proven that the system is corrupt beyond repair. The rule of law is dead. Equal protection under the law is dead. Trump is not going to Save anyone. He supports those involved and is making deals to keep the corrupt system in place. Only the Truth can Save the world before it is too late.
             </p>
             <p>
              We know it sounds strange, but it is the Truth. Racine, Wisconsin is the "root" of the global cabal and the agenda for global enslavement. Rothschilds &gt; Rockefellers &gt; Johnsons is the main link in the chain.

             The cloud.  If I hear one more person asking me if I know about the cloud I will scream.  No, I say.  Why would I want to know about something I will not use.  They look at me strangely.  What a world. You can not delete what is on the cloud.

            Anyone who allows Alexa into their house deserves what they get.  It's quite literally an open mic into your house.  They tell you it only turns on when you talk to it, but that's not how it works; the operational features (such as voice recognition and the ability to answer you) are hosted on the Amazon servers.  Thus, it has to always be listening/sweeping your house, and the servers have to be constantly analyzing everything you say.

             You can't escape from being spied on like that, though. Vault 7 showed that they can use your Samsung Smart TV as a covert microphone as well - it could potentially be inescapable.

              True.  Smart phones are highly suspect too.  However, in order to gather information on you, a smartphone needs to be adjusted/tweaked/hacked/whatever you want to call it... it's not a primary feature required for the operation of that phone.  For things like Alexa, it is.  Makes it a much simpler vector.
             </p>
             <p>
              It's the difference between locking your apartment or leaving it open when you leave.  No matter what you do, somebody can get into it if it's locked.  If you leave it open, it becomes much, much easier to steal from you.
             </p>
             <p>
              I'm not a huge fan of smart phones, either.

               At least you can disable your laptop's mic and webcam on the hardware level. It's awkward when your girlfriend calls you and it takes you 15 minutes to answer, though...

            And I am sure there will  not be any children home from school when there is a delivery, right.   Yes, 24/7 on all day.  What if your child was home sick all day?  I have a feeling there is a lot more to this than what they are telling.  There may be some way of getting tapes of what is going on in there while your child is in their bedroom.  Changing.  Think about it.  People that have kids need to tell them this is a very bad idea.  Your grand children will be on view 24/7 every day.  Think about that.   UpVoat4U  Great Write Up.

            And along with abduction, think what just watching kids will do for pervs. They're the ones that attend innocent activities like cheerleading or swimming, and turn the into something they're not. It would be like a real life Elisa.

             The idea of the Echo Look is to keep it in your wardrobe or on a wall and use it to refine your outfit for the day. The problem with this is that it also is kept on 24/7, so it can watch you change clothes

             Yep, they'll say it's safer because then their packages won't get stolen off their doorstep, and it's more convenient than going to the post office to pick up your package. The increasing invasion of our privacy, the dismantling of our rights, and the overt control over us has increased over the years because they stress security and convenience. And people continue to gulp the Kool-Aid.
