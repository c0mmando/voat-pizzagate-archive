<p>Publicly Verifiable Data 1: Laura Silsby was incarcerated in 2010 for kidnapping multiple children of color from Haiti. A total of 33 children were kidnapped.</p>
<p>Publicly Verifiable Data 2: Laua Silsby’s name was changed to Laura Gayler and she became CFO of AlertSense in 2011, an organization that provides the technology to push Amber Alerts to the public.</p>
<p>Publicly Verifiable Data 3: Amber Alerts were not pushed when multiple children of color began missing in Washington, DC.</p>
<p>Publicly Verifiable Data 4: DC Chief of Police Newsham has a reported history of “mishandling” a case of child rape.</p>
<p>Publicly Verifiable Data 5: DC police have a reported history of being directly involved in running a pedophile ring linked to child prostitution and the production of child pornography.</p>
<hr />
<p>Summing everything up:</p>
<p>– An individual who was incarcerated for kidnapping multiple children of color is working for the organization that distributes Amber Alerts.</p>
<p>– Multiple children of color have gone missing in DC, and Amber Alerts for their disappearances were not distributed.</p>
<p>– DC police officers have a documented history of reports for child sex crimes.</p>
<hr />
<p>Important questions:</p>
<pre><code>Why is Laura Silsby, a convicted kidnapper, involved in an organization responsible for the distribution of Amber Alerts?
Who is responsible for negotiating the release of Laura Silsby from Haiti after she was caught with 33 children who didn’t belong to her? Did any US politician try to get her released, and if so, who was it, and why did they do it?
Why have Amber Alerts not been activated and distributed after so many children have gone missing in DC?
Why is a police chief with a history of reported mishandling of child rape now in charge of finding missing DC children?
Why is it that multiple DC police have been involved in reports of child sex trafficking, child prostitution, or child pornography?
</code></pre>

<p>None of the data above is founded on empty speculation. It is all available to be verified.</p>

            let's not forget in the Johnny Gosch case that the police,
            <em>
             including the police chief himself
            </em>
            , were DIRECTLY involved in Johnny's abduction and the subsequent cover-up. Sadly, even the father was in on it, I feel great empathy and respect for Noreen Gosch.

             Was there a cover up investigation done? I would like a referral for reading about this if you have it. I actually watched the Johnny Gosch doc last night on Netflix. It was obvious there was a police coverup, but the Dad?

            It would make a lot of sense as to the lack of reporting of missing persons if they were "arrested" or "taken into custody" by the police.
           </p>
           <p>
            I'm still pessimistic about seeing any real justice. HRC still not in jail. DC police aiding in trafficking. FBI director still walking around without shackles.....

            great job!

           <p>
            One other clue can be found in  redacted hillary clinton emails - wikileaks
           </p>
           <p>
            search them for  SILSBY
           </p>
           <p>
            hillary clinton was briefed multiple times on the status of  Silsby and the missionaries.
           </p>
           <p>
            the redacted statements are likely the clue to finding out  "how Silsby was released"
