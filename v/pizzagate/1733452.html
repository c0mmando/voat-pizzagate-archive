            and I 100% believe they're telling the truth and that it's all being covered-up by the system. This absolutely needs to be exposed. Don't let the shills and trolls discourage you in exposing this case. You're not alone.

            He admitted to hitting them or 'licks' as he called them.  That is, hitting them hard enough to cut their faces and leave bruises, so it is not a leading question nor is it insincere.  I was merely asking if the person thought it was justified?
           </p>
           <p>
            Was his punching and kicking them and holding his hand over their noses and mouths and making them kneel while he poured water over them also justified?  Because that is what the children claimed he did.
           </p>
           <p>
            Simple enough questions.

            I see you do not mention that none of her peers agreed with her conclusions and she herself revised them, admitting they weren't as bad as she had made them out to be.  She was criticized for using an outdated technique which was discredited 25 years ago, to reach her summary.  She also agreed that the damage could have been caused by suppositories that the mother had given them for their constipation.  The results were not proof of any long term abuse and could have occurred naturally.  In short, a second and unbiased opinion should have been sought because hers was not unbiased or reliable.
           </p>
           <p>
            So do you think Christie was justified in his abuse of the children?

            you're not the only one familiar with the Hampstead case.  As I said, the judge is crooked.
           </p>
           <p>
            <strong>
             Judge Pauffley
            </strong>
            (
            <em>
             who was also the judge in the Hollie Grieg case
            </em>
            ) :
            <strong>
             Hampstead Judgement
            </strong>
            <a href="http://aanirfan.blogspot.co.uk/search?q=pauffley">
             http://aanirfan.blogspot.co.uk/search?q=pauffley
            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            excerpts:
           </p>
           <ul>
            <li>
             <p>
              Justice Pauffley (above) placed a great deal of emphasis on the conduct of Mr Abraham Christie (mother's boyfriend) and not on the father's record of domestic violence resulting in a separation from his wife and a non-molestation order.
             </p>
            </li>
            <li>
             <p>
              The judge's evidence was centered on Detective Sergeant Fernandez and Detective Constable Martin having a cursory glace around the vestry of Christ Church, including the drawers where the priest’s vestments were stored, searching for material to assist in their inquiries.
             </p>
            </li>
           </ul>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             "They found nothing of interest to the inquiry."
            </p>
            <p>
             They did not raid an address in Islington where the children alleged victims were taken. .
            </p>
           </blockquote>
           <ul>
            <li>
             <p>
              The judge dismissed out of hand the evidence of the medical expert (above), whom she calls "over-dogmatic" with a "scientific prejudice" because with no medical background or expertise, Pauffley decided that anal scarring was the result of a "normal varient."
             </p>
            </li>
            <li>
             <p>
              Pauffley did not discuss the film made by the Irish chap, without Abraham C present or any duress, where the girl volunteered more information - including her fears about the "bad police" telling her father that they, the children, had reported the father's crime; and her fears about her father coming to kill them, as he had threatened to do.
             </p>
            </li>
            <li>
             <p>
              it has been admitted that Scotland Yard has been covering up sadistic and satanic, serial child sex abuse and murders for the greater part of the 20th Century.
             </p>
            </li>
           </ul>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             What makes you think they are going to stop now?
            </p>
            <p>
             Theresa May says it is endemic in society and worse than we can imagine, in our youth clubs, churches and schools... except for Hampstead, where the children claimed they were subjected to multiple rape and infant sacrifice in a cult led by their father.

            Oh this case is by design and the same people behind pushing this one are the same that were trying to push the other hoax story of the Down's Syndrome girl.  I think it is the intention to discredit genuine cases while pushing incredulous ones that would be laughed out of court in the first 2 minutes.
           </p>
           <p>
            The children are victims over and over here again because the people pushing this story keep putting their names and their pictures out there for all the pedos to see (despite the court order prohibiting this to protect them) but they don't care about protecting the children at all because they will promote anything that identifies who they are.  What a nightmare these children must be living for the rest of their lives because of this.  Promoters never once stop to think about his.

            Well she was hardly mother of the year to start with as a neighbour once called the police and social services because she had locked out the children on their nightwear on the baclony with no food and water while she did whatever it was that was more important.

            Also, last time I looked, their webpage seems more concerned with the health benefits of hemp than the children themselves.

           <p>
            She had every opportunity to fight for her kids but chose a monster instead.  She cannot have failed to notice all the cuts and bruises on her kids in Morocco so either she turned a blind eye to what he was doing to them or she was complicit.  Either way it doesn't look good for her.
           </p>
           <p>
            Even the children said they didn't want to go back to her if she was still with him because they hated him for what he did to them.

             People have looked at this and seen it was one of those cases designed to discredit REAL abuse cases (not that the children in this case were not abused, but they were abused by someone other than the person who was being accused)

             Privatepizza - do you think the child porn found on Abraham's phone (the reason he did a runner) was of the two children or just your average anonymous child porn? Do you think it was acceptable for him to beat, torture and drug the kids to get the story straight?

              Hi norobotono. Thanks for sharing your views. I don't believe CP was found on Abraham's phone, and do believe Abraham is the patsy. I don't believe either that he beat, tortured or drugged the children. I believe that is disinformation designed to turn the spotlight onto Ella and Abraham, and away from where it should have been, and in the direction Ella and Abraham pointed it to in the first place.
I don't believe Abraham would have taken the children to the police with their allegations, with CP on his phone.  That's just to start.
             </p>
             <p>
              Anyone seriously looking at this subject, I believe, will come to the conclusion that the children were telling the truth. Lets agree to disagree. I'm not going to debate what's already been debated. People can look for themselves and decide, and be aware of all the disinfo surrounding the case.

               Again, I'm sorry that you totally deny what the medical evidence showed and that is that all the cut and bruise injuries on the children were recent and could only have been done in the last couple of weeks, meaning when they were in Morocco with him.  The test on the hair sample showed drugging with cannabis, more that could be accounted for with casual contact, meaning that they were drugged over a period of time.  He even admits to hitting them to get the story out of him and yet you still defend him.
              </p>
              <p>
               I will not agree to disagree with you because I call him out for what he is - a child abuser.  And not just of those two kids.  He beat his own kid and hospitalized his ex-wife once also.  37 times in jail for violence, drugs and lying and you still thinks he is snowy white.  Open your eyes and stop defending that sick man.

            Sad part is a lot of the supporters are abuse victims themselves and they want it to be true to vindicate what happened to them.. For some people it is hard to admit they have been taken for a ride by a real abuser so they will stick their heads in the sand rather than admit he fooled them.  They talk of imaginary abuse that happened for years only on the say so of what Abraham made them say, while totally refusing to see the real physical abuse on the children that is backed up by the medical report.  Recent cuts and bruises.
           </p>
           <p>
            They imagine a Rosemary's Baby type scenario where everyone at the school including ALL of the teachers, parents and children are abusers, except for the mother of course, who was totally innocent.  Anyone that questions the story is also on that list.  Anyone saying the children are better off away from him are evil people.
           </p>
           <p>

            Yes, especially the people promoting this rubbish.

            Real proof doesn't concern them when there is a fantastically impossible fantasy to believe in.

            Well I downvoted it and I would be happy for it to end up in court so that everyone can see how the mother allowed her boyfriend to torture her own kids in Morocco and then ran away with him rather than attend any of the court appearances or meetings about them.

            Maybe people will take this story seriously when the people promoting it acknowledge the physical and mental abuse that Abraham Christie inflicted upon them to get the story straight, instead of supporting the only proven real abuser here.
           </p>
           <p>
            Even then you would not believe it because you would rather pretend he never touched the kids despite the cuts and bruises on them than admit that you are wrong about him.
           </p>
           <p>
            Total denial of facts in favour of a fantasy.

              Standard response when confronted with what you don't want to admit.  You are yet another supporter of the real abuser.

              Answer this one question for me - would you be happy for the children to be released back into his vicinity?

            Two down votes from people who would rather this information stay in the shadows. Too bad. It's out, and SGT report gets tons of views and doesn't need Voat for exposure, so downvote all you want.
