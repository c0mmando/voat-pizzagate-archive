<p><strong>Pizzagate because:</strong> George Soros has been regularly implicated in global corruption which includes human trafficking/terrorism(or the funding thereof) and sedition/treason and etc. Also pizzagate because the credibility of Snopes is under question around these parts and they have been suspected of deliberately trying to derail pizzagate investigation.</p>

<h1>Early life, education, and career</h1>
<p>Schiff was born in Framingham, Massachusetts, the son of Edward and Sherrill Ann (Glovsky) Schiff.[2] He was raised in a Jewish family, and moved to Danville, California during high school.[3] He received a political science degree from Stanford University and a J.D. degree from Harvard Law School.</p>
<p>After receiving his law degree from Harvard, Schiff began working as a prosecutor in the Los Angeles branch of the U.S. Attorney\'s Office. While an assistant U.S. Attorney, he gained attention by prosecuting a case against Richard Miller, a former FBI agent convicted of &quot;passing secret documents to the Soviet Union in exchange for a promised $65,000 in gold and cash.&quot;[4] The first time Miller was tried, it resulted in a hung jury; the second time, it resulted in a conviction overturned on appeal,[5] and the third time he was convicted.</p>

<p>So, it would seem that Melissa Robin Schiff is indeed <strong><em>not</em></strong> the sister of Adam Schiff. George Soros being buddy-buddy with the CEO of Snopes + the confusion re: Robert D Soros and Melissa R Schiff, still strikes me as suspicious, though...</p>
<p>If I had to have a go at boiling it down, I\'d say they(Soros et al) are deliberately having this disinfo pushed so that Snopes can save the day(and their credibility) while simultaneously painting opponents of Soros/Obama/Clinton and Adam Schiff, as irrational.</p>
<p><strong>PS:</strong> Perhaps also, there might be reason to look into the family tree of Melissa Robin Schiff?</p>',

           So, it would seem that Melissa Robin Schiff is indeed
           <strong>
            <em>
             not
            </em>
           </strong>
           the sister of Adam Schiff. George Soros being buddy-buddy with the CEO of Snopes + the confusion re: Robert D Soros and Melissa R Schiff, still strikes me as suspicious, though...
          </p>
          <p>
           If I had to have a go at boiling it down, I'd say they(Soros et al) are deliberately having this disinfo pushed so that Snopes can save the day(and their credibility) while simultaneously painting opponents of Soros/Obama/Clinton and Adam Schiff, as irrational.
          </p>
          <p>
           <strong>
            PS:
           </strong>
           Perhaps also, there might be reason to look into the family tree of Melissa Robin Schiff?

            Good job. I was looking at this same stuff yesterday, over a Facebook comment that
            <em>
             confidently
            </em>
            claimed this Soros connection to Schiff. I didn’t go as far as you did. I looked at Snopes (
            <em>
             for dopes
            </em>
            - Haha, nice pic) to see what was there, then looked around a while longer and couldn’t find any truth in it. I pretty much just decided I was wasting my time. I’ll be interested to see if you, or me, or anyone, comes up with anything.
           </p>
           <p>
            Maybe someone should prank call Schiff, “This is George, I have some of our family pictures here...”

             Well, one way or another, there's two Schiff families involved in Soros-related happenings... it paints an eerie picture, no?
