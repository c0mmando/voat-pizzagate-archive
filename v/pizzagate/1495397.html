            What if choice is just an illusion? We don't fully understand the human mind. But you totally misunderstand what I'm advocating. I'm not saying these people are just troubled so leave them be. That's not at all what I'm saying. They most definitely need to be locked away for life. What I'm advocating against is extreme measures of torture and violence as a punishment for these people. I agree that we need to fight this evil but I don't think more evil is the answer and there are a lot of people advocating for some very evil things to be done to these people. If you go too far you will blindly become the evil monster that you once sought to fight.

            Pizzagate is about much more than elite pedophilia culture. It is also about mind-control and perpetuation of pedo-culture.  Honestly, I doubt that Alafontis and his instagram buddies even get what we're all messed up about. This is just normal and natural animal behavior to them, it's what they experienced in childhood. I think of the hideous painting on Podesta's office wall, the one with  cannibalis, he just naturally says it's better to be the one eating than the one eaten. That is seriously fucked up.

             Yes this whole thing is about more than what is on the surface. There are a lot of moving parts involved for sure. But what you're saying is partially the point I'm trying to make. The problem is so big that they do think that this lifestyle is normal because they have been subjected to it for so long. The human mind is a fragile thing that can easily be taken advantage of. So if these people were subjected to lifestyles that have severely warped their minds then we should be showing some compassion because any one of us could have been born into these circumstances. They are still people and were children once too. They need to be brought to justice but we shouldn't be exercising more hate and prosecution than we need to.

            I didn't even realize that castration was legal. It seems too that in some states surgical castration is even legal. But from what I was able to quickly ascertain any form of castration is only legal in 8 states which to me shows that most people would disagree with it including myself. I will admit I don't know enough about it where I feel confident in saying it is right or wrong but my gut tells me that it isn't right.

            I do agree that preventative measures need to be taken and I am arguing that one way we could do this is to not stigmatize the disorder of pedophilia so harshly and cruelly in our society. Much like how treating drug abusers as people with a sickness rather than treating them like criminals is more beneficial to their recovery, the same could be said about pedophilia. And again maybe in some or all cases some form of castration might be the solution I just don't know. But what I do know is that we need to discuss all of the ways of dealing with it and all I have seen discussed here and everywhere else is shoving shards of glass up their asses and the like. I know for a fact that isn't the solution.

            We need to come down hard on these people but we can't have a complete absence of love and compassion. These people are human beings and were once children themselves. Whether they were subjected to abuse growing up or born with messed up heads we can't ignore the fact that they are people and that their plight could have easily been bestowed upon any one of us.

            Empathy totally! Child trafficking epidemic as how Sue Arrigo describes it,

            probably wouldn't work unless many or most of the participants weren't mind controlled in some way.  Even the children themselves must recruit and torture other children. Many don't make it to adulthood but those that do are now in the industry.  I'm really interested in the life of James Alafontis. How exactly did he come from nowhere to be the 49th most powerful man in DC.  James Epstein's background is equally as mysterious.  Seeing as people rarely believe the victims of systemic ritual abuse, and very, very few people have any empathy for those that perpetuate the abuse, these people have almost no chance of coming forward to tell what happened. I think empathy, if that is your gift, is  a really important aspect of pizzagate.

             This exactly, yes! I had a thought last night that led me to finally make this post which I have been thinking about the past few weeks lurking on this page.
            </p>
            <p>
            </p>
            <p>
             I was thinking last night that in Hollywood the abuse of children probably starts really light and innocence. I can imagine it starts with dinners and light physical contact like hugging for example. Compliance with this behavior would then be rewarded with more roles and success. Then I imagine the abuse starts to escalate and those who continue to comply are the ones who continue to be rewarded. Like you said they all don't make it out alive or they don't go very far and those that do are the ones who are more likely to perpetuate the abuse they faced upon others.
            </p>
            <p>
            </p>
            <p>
             I imagine the same thing happens in politics. Reward behavior that is at first seemingly harmless and those who continue to comply as the abuse and atrocities continue to intensify are the people who become successful and  powerful in these circles.
            </p>
            <p>
            </p>
            <p>
             If this thing has remained more or less a secret and hushed up for so long then we are obviously dealing with something very serious and I believe all courses of dealing with it need to be discussed. I have seen plenty of discussion regarding hate so I thought it was only fair to bring up the fight for love and goodness.

            I never said that all victims become abusers but I do know that some of them do. I agree that they are sick fucks but what I disagree with is the attitude that these people need shards of glass shoved up their asses as punishment, as suggested by someone else in the comments. The reason I made this post is because of the disgusting hate that I have seen towards these abusers. Yes they do deserve hate and they need to be brought to justice but I think trying to work with these people as much as we can, and as much as they'll let us in order to understand the root of the problem and how we can go about fixing it.
           </p>
           <p>
           </p>
           <p>
            If we just condone their torture and mutilation as punishment then we are only perpetuating the abuse that is already happening.
           </p>
           <p>
           </p>
           <p>
            You just said so yourself that the system is creating these monsters and that the system is preventing victims from speaking up so how can you in good conscience advocate castration for these monsters that are a product their environment and not themselves? Yes they need to be brought to justice and locked away from society but we don't need to do the same acts to them or we become the same monsters we have fought against.

             I feel like you're agreeing in with us, but making a point to argue another person's view on what they believe punishment should be. Victims, have suppressed their own battles I think, at least I have; they now feel like they can vent, as they have support here, and can make a difference in SO many ways.
            </p>
            <p>
             If they have a history of abuse, and resulting in a mental condition, it SHOULD depend on what exactly they've done. ALL should be castrated, do it humanely, IDGAF, but that should be standard! I think that some people can't be fixed, like we do with bad dogs, we ought do with these people. One actually CAN be rehabbed, and it's not chester. This ruins people for their whole lives, you never really get over the dirty feeling when you come across these busts that you felt at that moment. I always flash back and get THAT feeling.
            </p>
            <p>
             Whatever the general consensus is, I'm with it. We're not barbarians, but we do need make example of the root (big fish) cause. Public hangings are the only way to deter further behavior of this kind. I look at severe punishment as a deterrent. Children cannot consent to this, not ever, BABIES definitely cannot. It should be dealt with severely, IMO

             Did you read what I wrote? I said they need to be locked up for life as well. My post is targeted towards those who believe the answer to this problem is to shove glass shards up their asses and castrate them and leave them on a deserted island. I'm not arguing against punishment I'm arguing what kind of punishment is appropriate and most effective.

              Locked up for life, away from general population because of their offender status. Seems like the easy route, that's not deterring anything.

              Source. Close family works within the Dept of Corrections, anyone watching LOCKUP or JAIL knows they're kept separate from danger other prisoners deal with. Seems too cushy to me. Can they be put with Gen pop?

            What evidence can you provide that there is absolutely NO excuse for harming a child. If some of these people were abused and traumatized as children themselves along with being born with a chemically imbalanced brain then it isn't at all shocking that they would turn out to be child abusers.
           </p>
           <p>
           </p>
           <p>
            Once again I will state that what they are doing to these children is totally and utterly wrong and that they should be brought to justice but we need to stay away from threatening their own well being with our punishments we bestow upon them or else we become the very same monsters we sought out to fight.

            Unless they seek help before touching a kid or putting them at risk. Then sure, compassion for someone who is seeking help. That's fine. But have you ever watched a heroin or meth junkie? They pretend to seek help... and then use it as cover to get right back into their shit.

             I'm not trying to normalize the presence of pedophiles. What I am trying to do is understand why they exist in the first place. There is some cause which probably stems to abuse suffered by the abuser in their own youth coupled with a severely chemically imbalanced brain. The human mind is a fragile thing.
            </p>
            <p>
            </p>
            <p>
             As someone who deals with depression and self confidence issues seeking help isn't always the easiest thing to do. I can't even imagine how hard it would be to seek help as a pedophile if help is what they wanted. But even if they don't want help they are a product of our society and a reflection of ourselves in some way and we must be as pure and peaceful as possible when combating their evil and abuse.

              That's attempting to normalize. I can't tell you how may people I know, whether or not I'm personally included, who got diddled as a kid or subjected to pedophiles earlier in their lives. I've talked to them. I've played this try to figure out what makes them tick.
             </p>
             <p>
              You know what it is, most of the time? They fantasize about fucking children.
             </p>
             <p>
              There should be very simple solutions. Monitoring. Out them if necessary. Make them wear the pedosymbols that apply to them. Exterminate them? Nah. Just keep them away from children and the rest of society.
             </p>
             <p>
              Go ahead and bring up ANY holocaust. Or Japanese-American Concentration camps. Hell, the KKK/SJW. I'd rather hang out with white/leftist supremacists than fucking pedophiles and I'm pretty sure they'd feel the same way.
             </p>
             <p>
              Are you a pedophile? Be honest.

             Why not try locking these people up in a safe in healthy environment where they are unable to cause more damage to our society? Then we can get them to a point where they feel like they can share with us what was going in their minds. We can find out from the source what their life was like to lead them down the path they ended up walking. Why do we have to be violent with these people? Maybe they were abused when they were younger and they have the same mentality as you. Maybe they feel like they need to take back what was taken from them.

              are you implying that I'm a child rapist/cannibal? Oh yes let's keep them in a nice healthy environment with WiFi where they can all be eating 5 star meals. Their "path" was created by their parents, and their parents path was created by THEIR parents. These people have legitimate bloodlines that follow these traditions. Obviously they were abused, but they chose to abuse others far worse. I say we put you in a room with them and you guys can have a nice talk. For someone that can't take a joke and feels the need to defend pedophiles this relentlessly is eyebrow raising.

               I'm not implying those things at all no. What I meant is that they are perpetuating abuse that has been done unto them and you are perpetuating violence when these things haven't been done to you but done unto other people, which obviously effects you, as it does to me as well. I wish no harm for anyone.
              </p>
              <p>
              </p>
              <p>
               If this is an issue that is being perpetuated by abuse throughout generations then how can you condone violence as a solution as well? I am not saying they deserve WI FI and 5 start meals but I think they deserve to have their voices heard without the threat of violence. They still deserve prison but we know what can go down in prisons to known child abusers. The inmates, many of whom are murderers and abusers themselves agree with your policy. So that is somewhat telling. All I think is that we don't advocate any more hatred and violence than we need to.

                Do you really not understand sarcasm? I'm not even condoning violence. My first comment was a joke but there was some truth to it. If they killed or ate your kids, obviously you would want to harm them. I don't see how being outraged is a bad thing. If this was another matter I would not feel as motivated to wish death upon them. However, it is a universal principle that if there's children involved, we must protect them by any means necessary. It's really easy to take the sjw/hippie high road and say "stop being so violent and show empathy", but if your kids were involved, then I'm sure you would agree.

                 Yes I understand sarcasm very well. I think in fact that I might be guilty of too much of it in my personal life. You should know that tone can be very hard to detect plainly through text. What you said didn't come off as sarcastic at all when this is mostly a place for serious discussion and when there are people seriously condoning shoving glass shards up the abusers asses as punishment.
                </p>
                <p>
                </p>
                <p>
                 But yes you are right in humor including sarcasm their is usually truth veiled behind it. I don't have kids but if I did and I knew this happened to them I imagine I might want to incite some kind of violence but I cannot say for sure. If I felt they were being punished appropriately maybe I wouldn't feel the need to perform any violence upon them myself, I don't know.
                </p>
                <p>
                </p>
                <p>
                 I also agree that we must take whatever measures that are necessary to put an end to all serious abuse in the world, especially when it involves children, but if death isn't necessary then it shouldn't be used as punishment and I merely want to discuss this nature of the problem because frankly everyone so far has been doing a good job uncovering the truth of the matter. I am happy with this community and the work they have done.
                </p>
                <p>
                </p>
                <p>
                 I can't sit here and tell you exactly what forms of punishment are necessary but I can assure you that we always need to maintain some level of empathy in every situation, whether good or bad.

             Honestly your version of justice is just as sick and disgusting as they are and it only perpetuates the hate. Anybody else struggling with similar internal demons who haven't done anything wrong yet could be afraid to seek help because of people like you advocating for disgusting and inhumane justice.

              No, My vision of dealing with child molesters makes other POS human beings that would rape a child have 2nd thoughts about it, instead of going to prison if caught, you get tortured then killed publicly. Theres not much worse then a child molester.

               I will start my counter argument by stating that I don't know anything about the science of pedophilia like what causes. If however that it is something that for some reason is just innately in some people just like being gay or schizophrenic then your attitude could further exacerbate the issue. If these people have no control over their desires and will commit these atrocities regardless of what punishments are being used then I imagine that they would be more inclined to cover up their actions and to not seek help if they are facing the punishments that you wish for these people.

              <p>
               If however we treat this problem like a disease much like we are starting to do with drug abusers, then perhaps we can start moving towards a place of understanding the problem and solving it appropriately instead of just hastily injecting more pain and suffering into the world.

               It's attitudes like yours that cause these people to hide and cover up more than they would otherwise.

                So are you fishing for counter arguments so you can better present your case to weak minded humans to get them on your side?  maybe you're confusing CHILD MOLESTERS with someone attracted to children.

                 No I am looking for counter arguments so that this issue can be discussed which will hopefully shed some light on the right way to deal with the guilty people involved with this scandal. Someone who is attracted to children seems to me to be a likely candidate to be a child molester. I obviously don't know the percentage of people who have this attraction compared to the people that follow through on it but I'm sure it isn't 100 percent.

                <p>
                 My point is whatever the cause of abuse is the way we go about punishing it needs to be discussed because our westernized prison system is based upon condemnation and hate instead of rehabilitation and empathy. I don't think the most extreme hateful and violent justice is the answer.

            the words 'compassion ' and ' empahty ' when it comes to pedophilia and pedophiles does not sit well at all with normal people. What can be done is use the rule of law , no vigilante groups , and common civility. However , most people feel that if they are not brought to justice , the pedophiles are marked people. Sooner or later they will get caught. I've know personally 2 people , parents , that killed the pedophile(s) that went after their respective little kids. I can't say I blame them. Unfortunately , that caused the parent(s) to go to prison. I understand, though, what drove them to such drastic steps. When you mess with little kids , the most innocent of society , the most helpless of humankind , well , us grown ups don't and( rightfully so) won't abide them being victimized, traumatized, and even murdered at the hands of the sexual deviant that decided to make the children their victims.

             Did you not read what I wrote? In the first line I specifically wrote that they need to be brought to justice. You are stating that children are the most helpless of humankind and I've got a newsflash for you, we were all children once including these pedophiles. If they too were abused as children then don't they deserve some kind of sympathy at the very least?

              No. I don't have sympathy for pedophiles. None. They choose to do what they do. They have more accountability if they had been victims of sexual abuse as a child. They have first hand knowledge of the  lifetime devastation to the soul it perpetuates. I do feel for their suffering they will go through in the next life though for the victims they caused in this one.
