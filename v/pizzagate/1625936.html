<p>Trump Towards the Rise of a Haitian Narco-State</p>
<p>\'Mr. Trump wants to dismantle the “failed foreign policy” of former U.S. President Barack Obama, a foreign policy fashioned by the Clintons. No where, but in Haiti, are the Clintons’ fingerprints so muddied the landscape. The Obama-Clinton support for the rise of criminal elements in the 2010 elections and throughout the years since, is no longer. This means the incoming administration of Jovenel Moise, the hand-picked continuation of the regime, holding no political legitimacy, already roiled in scandals of drug-trafficking and money-laundering, will not have that safety net.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Mr. Trump has shown an inclination to pull support from the United Nations. Its peacekeepers in Haiti have led to deaths, sexual assault, and been embroiled in scandals for politicizing the electoral process and supporting the despotic power holders who have a quasi-totalitarian inclination. Before Mr. Moïse has even taken office he’s impressed on the judiciary, regulatory and oversight institutions, and has a Parliament of heinous, some convicted, criminals to accept his bribes. The scene is set.</p>
<p>All these signs, including the history of U.S. Republican administrations towards Haiti, suggest President Trump will not be into playing games, equivocating or extending the soft bigotry of low expectations characterized by the Democrat foreign policy towards Haiti. Haitian politicians, seen by their arrogance in carousing with crime syndicates, seem to not see it coming.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>The political party in power in Haiti was backed by the Clinton State Department in 2010 in spectacular fashion, including riots funded by USAID and election results “changed”, according to the chief election official, by Cheryl Mills, the secretary’s chief of staff and exec at the Clinton Foundation.</p>
<p>To ensure a smooth siphon of billions in earthquake relief funds, the 2010 State Department supported what the Kerry State Department would later call one of the most corrupt administrations in the country’s history. Haitians began learning about the inner-workings of the public-private corruption in the country only recently, although it had long been suspected.\'</p>
<p>Talks about Rex TIllerson\'s involvement with Haiti and the scandals of the new President there. The founder and editor-in-chief of the Haiti Sentinel Samuel Maxime is an expat living in the U.S. Seems like a good resource for Haitian issues.</p>

            Notice how the "press" (fake news) flees around 14:30 when they don't like what they are hearing... I believe it was supposed to be an hour long  - but they cut it off and stopped recording it.

             The original article was the Haitian ex-pats wishful thinking that Trump is going to kick some ass. But it's a delicate situation, this new, scandal-ridden President is in power, how does he deal with that? We'll see.

            <p>
             The political party in power in Haiti was backed by the Clinton State Department in 2010 in spectacular fashion, including riots funded by USAID and election results “changed”, according to the chief election official, by Cheryl Mills, the secretary’s chief of staff and exec at the Clinton Foundation.

            The Clinton State Department under Hillary Clinton along with Cheryl Mills, cited as directly complicit? Isn't this what we've been looking for?

             More on this allegation:

            <p>
             'In fact, Pierre Louis Opont, who served as Director General of Haiti’s Provisional Electoral Council (CEP) in 2010 and then was appointed by the country’s elite to serve as CEP president for Haiti’s 2015 failed highly fraudulent highly violent elections, said in a July 2, 2015 interview (audio) [link in original] that it was Cheryl Mills, Clinton’s Chief of Staff at the State Department and “volunteer” executive at the Clinton Foundation, who changed the election results.'
