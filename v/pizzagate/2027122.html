<p>As stated above, I’m not done with posting about this bitch. Like the humble gopher, I’m digging and digging and not surprised by the ugly connections I’m finding.

<p>In April 2015, Hillary Clinton named Harris as one of her three senior policy advisors.[1] When she was hired, Vox looked at a white paper Harris published for the Center for American Progress, noting Harris interest in the potential impact of women of color on the 2016 election.  
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is bullshit! Per the email sent by Tanden they needed a TOKEN WOMAN OF COLOR. That’s all Maya was … a token for the DNC to look as if they adhered to, and believed in the “diversity” they were always preaching. Obviously not! But did Maya Harris refuse the offer? Did she shun the DNC and make a statement denouncing the practice of filling the ranks with tokens instead of hiring on merit? Hell, no! She took the job and fit right in. But then the Cannibal Elite never look beyond their list of friends and Maya and Kamala are that. Killary wasted no time putting them both on display:</p>

<p>And Maya proves just what a friend and that she’s in bed with what’s going down. This is proven by the April 2016 memo that informs  John Pedosta that she’s ATTENDNG A PIZZA PARTY! </p>

Maya Harris is joining, but need you. 
Can you come? 
Thanks much, </p>

<p>Yup! BOOM! There it is! If you wanted to know how scummy the Harris’ sisters are, that tells you everything you need to know. Kamala gets her start letting Willie Brown squeeze in between her legs and have a go, and Maya is given a token position, and she accepts it—and the pizza!!!! </p>
<p>Meanwhile, the press lies to proffer the image conjured up that Kamala is an independent, big-mouthed carp who champions women and kids and everything bright and shiny. The faux news does this by printing outright lies. Take David Geffen for instance. Yeah, the David Geffen of Bryan singer, Marc Collins-Rector fame. He has a track record of investing in both of these scum bags. But where’s proof of the assertion I made about lies? Here: </p>

<p>Really? It sure sounds like David hasn’t given a cent to cash poor/but skank rich Kamala. But wait! What about this:</p>

</blockquote>
<p>But who else does self-indulgent, narcissist Kamala know? How did the skank sisters get on that A-list. Probably surrounds herself with humble people. Nope! Think again: </p>

</blockquote>
<p>Kamala is a pal of ANN GETTY? But how close of a PAL? </p>

<p>Shannon Bavaro and Peter Getty’s Wedding Celebration at the Getty Mansion—The Groom’s Parents’ Home
January 30, 2017 1:00 PM. </p>
<p>The ceremony was an intimate family-only affair in the afternoon at their home. The couple’s longtime friend and recently elected senator Kamala Harris was on a tight schedule, so our nuptials were earlier in the day before she left for D.C. “My brother gave me away, which was so special as we are very close,” says Shannon. “It was an emotional and joyous moment.”
“Before I walked down, Kamala came and spoke to me privately,” remembers Shannon. “She said to be in the moment, remember why I was there, and to embrace the love and the joy. She is so wise. I took a deep breath, and when I walked downstairs, I was so present and overcome with love. It was beautiful.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>WAIT! STOP!!!! <em>sniffle sniffle</em> I have to pause for a moment! <em>breaks down in tears</em> <em>blows nose into a tissue</em> Soooo beautiful ….  Think of it … Kamala Harris … the little piece of scum that had to let Willie Brown crawl between her legs to get national attention is now such a good friend to Ann Getty and Peter Getty! It’s like The Little Match Girl meets Basic Instinct! Come on, Kamala! Let’s have that money shot on the interrogation chair!!! </p>
<p>But how long has she been on the DNC’S radar. Who knows, but it’s not everyone that receives an invite to the White House State Dinner: </p>
<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>Yup, there’s the SKANK SISTERS! Kamala and Maya!!!Hope they used disinfectant after they left. But who else do I see on this list … why it’s David Geffen David Geffen and Jeremy Lingvall!!! So the skanks can’t say they didn’t have the opportunity to meet him since they did in 2010. Wonder if they discussed the legalities of twink parties? </p>
<p>But besides Kamala’s infamous legs that are open 24/7, the senator from Woo-woo Land has that BIG FUCKING MOUTH that I’m sure she puts to good use. The media keeps printing the narrative of how she’s so “effective” in public speaking, but remember her questioning of Jeff Sessions? Why she had all the temerity of a piece of lint on his suit jacket that he couldn’t brush away! You know, sometimes that little lint ball gets magnetized and you have to literally pick it off. But we were talking about Kamala. If she tried to go after Sessions, she’d do the same for all those feminist ideals she pretends to support? WRONG AGAIN! </p>

<p>A DISGRACE! Brave Muslim Leaders Viciously Attacked For Fighting Against Honor Killings, Child Marriages, And Female Genital Mutilation
July 1, 2017  Also on the SPLC’s list is Ayaan Hirsi Ali, the Somali-born author and activist who herself survived female genital mutilation and a forced marriage. Ali and fellow activist Asra Q. Nomani recently appeared before the Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs and were shocked that none of the four female Democrats on that panel — including Kamala Harris, who’d become a feminist cause célèbre the day before, after male colleagues interrupted her interrogation of Attorney General Jeff Sessions — asked a single question.
In a June 22 Times Op-Ed, Ali and Nomani called out Harris along with Sens. Maggie Hassan, Heidi Heitkamp and Claire McCaskill.
“What happened that day was emblematic of a deeply troubling trend among progressives when it comes to confronting the brutal reality of Islamic extremism and what it means for women in many Muslim communities here at home and around the world,” they wrote. “When it comes to the pay gap, abortion access and workplace discrimination, progressives have much to say. But we’re still waiting for a march against honor killings, child marriages, polygamy, sex slavery or female genital mutilation.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So she can\'t even take a stand on female mutilation a practice done on INFANTS? Is she that much of a hypocrite? Yes! But is there more! Hell, yes! There’s lots more. Seems she STEALS tapes that allegedly incriminate the bastion of libtard thinking PLANNED PARENTHOOD! </p>

<p>But isn’t that illegal? It would be if anyone else did it, but it’s just Kamala being Kamala. She can’t control herself, and wouldn’t that make a great person to put in The White House. Mull that over for a while.</p>',

           Yup! BOOM! There it is! If you wanted to know how scummy the Harris’ sisters are, that tells you everything you need to know. Kamala gets her start letting Willie Brown squeeze in between her legs and have a go, and Maya is given a token position, and she accepts it—and the pizza!!!!

           Meanwhile, the press lies to proffer the image conjured up that Kamala is an independent, big-mouthed carp who champions women and kids and everything bright and shiny. The faux news does this by printing outright lies. Take David Geffen for instance. Yeah, the David Geffen of Bryan singer, Marc Collins-Rector fame. He has a track record of investing in both of these scum bags. But where’s proof of the assertion I made about lies? Here:

            The ceremony was an intimate family-only affair in the afternoon at their home. The couple’s longtime friend and recently elected senator Kamala Harris was on a tight schedule, so our nuptials were earlier in the day before she left for D.C. “My brother gave me away, which was so special as we are very close,” says Shannon. “It was an emotional and joyous moment.”
“Before I walked down, Kamala came and spoke to me privately,” remembers Shannon. “She said to be in the moment, remember why I was there, and to embrace the love and the joy. She is so wise. I took a deep breath, and when I walked downstairs, I was so present and overcome with love. It was beautiful.”

           Yup, there’s the SKANK SISTERS! Kamala and Maya!!!Hope they used disinfectant after they left. But who else do I see on this list … why it’s David Geffen David Geffen and Jeremy Lingvall!!! So the skanks can’t say they didn’t have the opportunity to meet him since they did in 2010. Wonder if they discussed the legalities of twink parties?
          </p>
          <p>
           But besides Kamala’s infamous legs that are open 24/7, the senator from Woo-woo Land has that BIG FUCKING MOUTH that I’m sure she puts to good use. The media keeps printing the narrative of how she’s so “effective” in public speaking, but remember her questioning of Jeff Sessions? Why she had all the temerity of a piece of lint on his suit jacket that he couldn’t brush away! You know, sometimes that little lint ball gets magnetized and you have to literally pick it off. But we were talking about Kamala. If she tried to go after Sessions, she’d do the same for all those feminist ideals she pretends to support? WRONG AGAIN!

            A DISGRACE! Brave Muslim Leaders Viciously Attacked For Fighting Against Honor Killings, Child Marriages, And Female Genital Mutilation
July 1, 2017  Also on the SPLC’s list is Ayaan Hirsi Ali, the Somali-born author and activist who herself survived female genital mutilation and a forced marriage. Ali and fellow activist Asra Q. Nomani recently appeared before the Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs and were shocked that none of the four female Democrats on that panel — including Kamala Harris, who’d become a feminist cause célèbre the day before, after male colleagues interrupted her interrogation of Attorney General Jeff Sessions — asked a single question.
In a June 22 Times Op-Ed, Ali and Nomani called out Harris along with Sens. Maggie Hassan, Heidi Heitkamp and Claire McCaskill.
“What happened that day was emblematic of a deeply troubling trend among progressives when it comes to confronting the brutal reality of Islamic extremism and what it means for women in many Muslim communities here at home and around the world,” they wrote. “When it comes to the pay gap, abortion access and workplace discrimination, progressives have much to say. But we’re still waiting for a march against honor killings, child marriages, polygamy, sex slavery or female genital mutilation.”
           </p>
          </blockquote>
          <p>
           So she can't even take a stand on female mutilation a practice done on INFANTS? Is she that much of a hypocrite? Yes! But is there more! Hell, yes! There’s lots more. Seems she STEALS tapes that allegedly incriminate the bastion of libtard thinking PLANNED PARENTHOOD!

           But isn’t that illegal? It would be if anyone else did it, but it’s just Kamala being Kamala. She can’t control herself, and wouldn’t that make a great person to put in The White House. Mull that over for a while.

            THIS IS REALLY IMPORTANT.
Contrary to what is portrayed in the press, there are a lot of faithful Catholics  in California, even in San Francisco. Kamila did really unacceptable things when David Daleiden exposed the gruesome practices of Planned Parenthood in altering surgeries on women, not for the sake of their health, but for the purpose of getting the most money out of her dead fetus. 
These people have severely hurt a lot of young women in California.
            <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3oY53bQo2E">

            </a>
            These are real Californians, real San Franciscans at the recent Pro-Life March in San Francisco, 2017. The cops are not necessarily there to support us, though some of this probably do, but to protect us because we are in danger in speaking out for the lives of children. 
What really makes our enemies mad is that you will not find so diverse a bunch of people in any other situation. 
I have seen priests given the middle finger and screamed at here. This is 180 degrees apart from the San Francisco I was born in. Please watch this if you want to know what the natives are like. The natives are in this march.

            Don't forget Kamala's friend George Soros: 
She has the deep pocket donors lined up: "Harris also has ties to billionaire Democratic Party donor George Soros, who was one of the two owners of OneWest Bank at the time. Coincidentally, before Harris passed on the opportunity to file action against OneWest Bank, Soros was pouring money into California criminal policy initiatives that Harris was pushing."http://www.msn.com/en-us/news/politics/clinton-donors-have-picked-their-2020-democratic-presidential-nominee/ar-BBEBhcw?li=BBmkt5R&amp;ocid=spartanntp "

            One of California Attorney General Kamala Harris' (D) staffers was arrested last week and "accused of operating a rogue police force that claimed to exist for more than 3,000 years," The Los Angeles Times reported Wednesday

           <p>
            Brandon Kiel, deputy director of community affairs at the California Department of Justice, and two others — David Henry and Tonette Hayes — reportedly face charges for their roles in the Masonic Fraternal Police Department.

            In 2003 or 04, a friend ( no longer) gushed about Obama to me. We had never agreed on politics, so I thought I better look this character up. So, you can imagine how sick I was, when in 2008, he had been Manchurian-ed into the wh. Now realize that McCain was a puppet and knew there was no way he would be prez. Now, this crap is starting ALL over again. We have to be so vigilant and get the word out about her and, geffen, getty, hrc, obamamamadingdong, etc.

             This is exactly what I'm talking about. We've all seen it too many times before. At first, we ignored the signals, and these puppets got elected. The stakes are too high to allow it to happen. Don't let any one of their choices gain momentum. Just think about what would be the most embarrassing and most likely to deter a voter at the polls. If we do our job, we'll head off their agenda of getting this bitch into the WH.

              Quantokitty.....you do excellent work. Every day, I am amazed at how much I learn here on voat.....that I feel kind of sorry for the poor, blind idiots. However, I can't really share, because so many are just in a stupid haze and don't want to know or even care. I'm old, so I am not worried about the next 50 years for me, but I am for loved ones coming up. So much evil, so much depravity  and just horrible thoughts of the world "tomorrow," this is why I want to continue to fight and try and change things. Trump might not be perfect but he is certainly better than hrc, dws, abedin, obh, et. Al.

               Yeah, I cannot believe I  hadn't  heard any  of  this  information about Harris on MSN, which  further leads  me  to  believe  it  is  time to call  up  the  militia, unorganized  militia and replace this  foul government and hold free elections, arrest  the  traitors in office  and restore  our  Constitution

               Don't be discouraged. I was one of those poor blind idiots so you never know what's going to turn people around. For me, it was seeing the direction my beautiful country was headed in. The last eight years have been torture for me to endure, but the agony of seeing these horrendous policy decisions has galvinized me by red pilling me. While I still hold the ideals I did back when I was a rabid lib,  I realized that was not the lib platform. They were just using these ideals to hide their depraved agenda.

               This is a community, and in a community each member does what they can to keep it healthy and thriving. What you're doing is uber important so don't compare it to what someone else is doing. Keep the faith because things are happening so rapidly that we're not aware of how much progress has been made. Key arrests have been made and key inquiries are in the works.
