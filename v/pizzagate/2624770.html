            I recall listening to part of an interview in a documentary called 'Savile and the Ninth Circle' (which exposes the depths of organised paedophilia within the UK establishment) where it was claimed that for many of the children abused by Heath on his yacht, especially if they were older children who might be able to identify their abusers, it was a one way trip; that these children were subsequently murdered and their bodies dumped in the sea.

            I read the whole story this evening. Thank you for posting.  Im sorry to see the post did not attract much attention here. Can you imagine the number of children lost at sea? Are these victims coming from low class dysfunctional homes? Where are the warnings to  parents that your poor parenting can lead to unspeakable abuse if your child enters the child welfare system?
