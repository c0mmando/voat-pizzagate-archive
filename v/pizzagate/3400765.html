           <blockquote>
            <p>
             The culture war has a new home: the cable a la carte debate.
            </p>
            <p>
             A sex-education group is coming under strong attack from a conservative quarter for opposing efforts to require cable operators to sell programming on an a la carte basis.
            </p>
            <p>
             The Sexuality Information and Education Council of the United States is fighting a la carte mandates, claiming that they would threaten the survival of niche networks that need the subscriber exposure afforded by large tiers.
            </p>
            <p>
             However, Concerned Women for America, in a strongly worded statement posted on its Web page Friday (www.cwfa.org/articles/6171/CFI/pornography/index.htm), said SIECUS was using the a la carte issue to advance an agenda of favoring unrestrained sex education over teen-abstinence programs.
            </p>
            <p>
             “We’re not surprised to see the sex-with-kids lobby weighing in on the cable choice debate,” said Robert Knight, director of CWA’s Culture &amp; Family Institute. “After all, they know how much of an ally television has been in destroying children’s innocence and setting them up for premature sex. Although they pay lip service to worrying about minority-themed channels, the real agenda is to keep the sex flowing to kids and, particularly, the homosexual programming.”
            </p>
            <p>
             With 500,000 members, CWA is a right-of-center group that wants the federal government to prosecute pornographers and promote ways to restrict children’s access to indecent TV programming.
            </p>
            <p>
             CWA has voiced support for greater a la carte cable options endorsed by Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) and Rep. Nathan Deal (R-Ga.). The Federal Communications Commission is preparing an a la carte report for Congress due Nov. 18.
            </p>
            <p>
             SIECUS spokeswoman Adrienne Verrilli said her group is repeatedly attacked by CWA, so the clash over a la carte was no surprise.
            </p>
            <p>
             “CWA is a right-wing organization primarily advancing a very anti-women agenda,” Verrilli said. “They’re anti-choice, they’re anti-family planning, they don’t support sexuality education, they don’t support the Family Leave Act, and the list goes on and on and on.”
            </p>
            <p>
             Founded in 1964, SIECUS argues that teen-abstinence programs, if not combined with sex education, are ineffective in combating teen pregnancy and sexually transmitted diseases.
            </p>
            <p>
             Earlier in the month, SIECUS filed comments with the FCC saying that a la carte “would have a significant negative impact” on networks that cater to “women, minorities, gays and lesbians and non-English-language speakers.”
            </p>
            <p>
             <strong>
              SIECUS was one of dozens of organizations contacted for a la carte help by Oxygen Media chairman and CEO Geraldine Laybourne
             </strong>
             , an outspoken critic of tier unbundling.
            </p>
            <p>
             “We spoke with Oxygen about channel choice, or whatever it is, and we are very supportive of their programming and their network and feel that it is very important that programming stays diversified,” Verrilli said.
            </p>
            <p>
             Knight said SIECUS was using the a la carte issue to frustrate efforts to promote abstinence until marriage.
            </p>
            <p>
             “Clearly, this position on cable choice is an indication that SIECUS wants to keep parents from standing between their children and the SIECUS version of ‘age-appropriate’ sexual information,” he added

            Fucking freaks have been getting away with this shit under the guise of 'research' for years. I took A level Psychology in 1996 in the UK. After having to learn about Freud and his BS I left, it just got worse. I think I stuck it for around two months. No wonder people turn into sexual deviants when it's preached in the education system as being scientific fact.

             Satan worshippers are trying to recreate the Roman Empire of Jesus' day. This time they are building with a higher level of technology. Don't worry, it will collapse too. We are pilgrims passing through to the real kingdom. James 4:4-10 KJV

              Adam Young, the "Port Blue" artist (also known as Owl City) wrote a song, "Galaxies"  inspired by the launch sequence of the Challenger disaster. Evidently, his mother was pregnant with him at the time. His parents talked about the Challenger as he was growing up. Adam became a Christian, so know you will understand the words.....

            It is hard for people addicted to the dual income lifestyle but for anyone "woke" enough to be reading voat: if you still have kids or are going to put kids in the public school system you CANNOT in good conscience.

               It's more complicated than that. What do you propose someone do with kids heading to public school and stuck as wagies? You can't simply quit and homeschool and private schools are mini colleges in terms of tuition costs.

                It isn't.  You either care enough to make it a priority and make it happen with homeschooling or keep lying to yourself that you "just can't afford to".

             you need to remember that the damage of trans culture isn't in the actual subversion of people into trans. Their % is too low in the population to actually affect anything.
            </p>
            <p>
             The damage is in forcing the entire population to believe and say things they know are wrong.
            </p>
            <p>
             Think of Picard's "there are 4 lights!" episode (star trek). This is how you psychologically control people: force them by threat and fear to parrot and believe things they know are wrong. You don't need to make whites trans for that - you can just take the weakest of society. "

              FYI I think WI is Corrupt has shifted names and I can't remember the current one but go have a look here on Voat (maybe search "Pilgrim" or something like that that is rare otherwise, but often mentioned by WI).  Exact same writing style and themes.  Love WI and glad there was a replacement!

              Actually, it's both: forcing people to buy into their delusions AND indoctrinating kids into trans.  Children experiencing teenage angst or depression are now being labelled as 'gender dysphoric' and being referred to gender clinics for hormone blockers and surgery. The kids who get put on puberty blockers stay stuck on Tanner stage 2 and lose all sexual feelings, forever.

               I so agree. These teachings now will confirm in their brains what we all know is wrong. They are looking to be told that what they believe they are- well - that it’s ok. And what they are doing is ok. NOpe

             Lord Bertrand Russell joined with the Frankfurt School in their effort at mass social engineering and spilled the beans in his 1951 book, The Impact of Science on Society. He wrote:
             <em>
              ‘Physiology and psychology afford fields for scientific technique which still await development.’ The importance of mass psychology ‘has been enormously increased by the growth of modern methods of propaganda. Of these the most influential is what is called ‘education. The social psychologists of the future will have a number of classes of school children on whom they will try different methods of producing an unshakable conviction that snow is black. Various results will soon be arrived at.

              First, that the influence of home is obstructive. Second, that not much can be done unless indoctrination begins before the age of ten. Third, that verses set to music and repeatedly intoned are very effective. Fourth, that the opinion that snow is white must be held to show a morbid taste for eccentricity. But I anticipate. It is for future scientists to make these maxims precise and discover exactly how much it costs per head to make children believe that snow is black, and how much less it would cost to make them believe it is dark gray . When the technique has been perfected, every government that has been in charge of education for a generation will be able to control its subjects securely without the need of armies or policemen.”

             From one 1968 anti-SIECUS/anti-Mary Calderone pamphlet that was widely distributed:
            </p>
            <blockquote>
             <p>
              However, the thrust of SIECUS is to get
              <strong>
               the most sex information to the child as early as possible
              </strong>
              to ostensibly counteract what Dr. Calderone describes as misinformation children learn from parents….(p. 2)....Her answer to the 'question, "How can I judge if our sex-education courses are good?" is an amazing, **"I'm afraid that parents cannot exercise judgments as to quality in terms of content because most parents are not qualified.  Even many doctors are not qualified," she declares, "except to judge
             </p>
             <p>
              the accuracy of the biological and physiological content. But the
             </p>
             <p>
              emotional and behavior content requires a different kind of judgment"** (p. 3)

             Dr. Reisman was a good friend of a fellow education researcher. She endured much persecution for her original expose of Kinsey and his pedophile research. She is the real deal.
            </p>
            <p>
             "In her book Kinsey: Crimes and Consequence, Dr. Reisman explains how since the '60s The Kinsey Institute was determined to incorporate Kinsey's philosophy into sex education material for children. They partnered with Planned Parenthood to achieve this objective. Dr. Reisman exposes how it was Kinsey's research that claimed that children are sexual and potentially orgasmic from birth and are unharmed by incest and adult-child sex and often benefit from such activity. His influence also inspired Hugh Hefner to launch Playboy Magazine.
            </p>
            <p>
             So all of this sexual psychopathology is what started sexual education? Apparently, yes. Kinsey's research (which was funded by the ROCKEFELLER FOUNDATION) led him to draw the conclusion that children are "sexual beings" from birth."

              Hefner worked for the intelligence services.  Both Playboy and Penthouse magazines originated from them.  All part of the plan to bring in the degeneration of society and open up channels for the blackmailing network.
