            I posted this yesterday about a person who could be a human trafficking link between Qatar , Haiti, Bosnia, and Clinton Foundation:
            <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/v/pizzagate/1524304">
             https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1524304
            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            Summary: refugee from Bosnia Salena Diana Jenkins arrives penniless in London, randomly meets Barclays bank exec, INTRODUCES exec to the PRIME MINISTER OF QATAR in 2006 (how does a refugee do this?), they divorce and she takes $150 million pound settlement, moves to Malibu, allegedly starts pimping Hollywood starlets, best friends with Clooney, Sean Penn, Ari Fleischer, Clintons. Creates numerous non-profits in Bosnia, Haita focusing on orphanages and children's rights, co-sponsors Haiti org with Sean Penn, huge donor to Clinton Foundation and funnels her work through it, her Qatar prime minister connection goes on to start funding Syrian rebels.
           </p>
           <p>
            I dunno, seems relevant to what Webb is talking about here in the video when he discusses trafficking and points to CCC and the Middle East.

            This one is very interesting about a corrupt police chief accused of forcing oral sex on a woman and trying to cut the FBI out of the Long Island killer loop.

            Transcript from that part of he video:
           </p>
           <p>
            “…at times people come forward… and there is violence in the situations, in this evening entertainment situation, or several people come forward and they want to blackmail or whatever.  If you look into the Long Island serial killer case, I think you’re going to see a connection there because when people with these diplomatic passports come over and get in trouble they don’t have to answer to the law because they have diplomatic passports but they have to answer to the world of public opinion and that’s where you’re going to get into some of these serial killer type situations.”

            Here's a transcript of the part where he mentions Comet Ping Pong.  You'd have to transcribe the entire audio to get the full context, though.
           </p>
           <hr/>
           <p>
            "The next place you would go, you would fly down to Washington DC and go to the World Bank….
           </p>
           <p>
            This is where you’re going to be meeting with the foreign minsters of Saudi Arabia, and Kuwait, UAE, Bahrain and so forth. This is where the den of iniquity — I’m not pointing at these people saying the den of iniquity - but these people, many times the princes and sons of the kings of the country. They may have 50 or 60 sons. Osama Bin Laden is probably the best example, he was one of 50 sons and his father owned one of the largest construction companies, as well, in Saudi Arabia.
           </p>
           <p>
            So, this is where you’re getting the Comet Pizza thing, where you’re not having things happen there but, there is a very good chance from the evidence I’ve seen so far, that there is this kind of showcasing.  So you’ve got these stringers that go out and bring in people and foster parents and, etc.. and I don’t want to get into who is and who isn’t….but I’m just saying if  want a lead this is where you should look.”

            He says Comet is likely a "showcase," then points to logos of almabani (Saudia Arabian contractor) and CCC (Consolidated Contractors Company, largest construction company in the Middle East), and says, "this is where to look." Gets nervous.
            <br/>
            He says to look at gas attacks and connect it with missing kids.
            <br/>
            Just a couple notes. This video has a lot for trafficking researchers.

             I don't know where to even begin with CCC in terms of leads, but take a look at this article I found regarding he Long Island serial killer and the FBI allegedly making a link between one victim and a possible human trafficking ring:

              That Private Investigator is kind of hilarious, I bet he would make the good subject of a TV show. 
His 'tag line' is SEX, CRIME, CHEATERS and TERRORISM. What varied work that must be, one day you're photographing Mrs Johnson with the mailman and the next you're on the tail of international terrorist organisations.

            Mr. Webb,
           </p>
           <p>
            It look as though the UN and WHO are  tied in to what you are doing only, not just in providing trucks but instead of stingers and sarin gas, they are using other things to clear areas near oil.
           </p>

            What they may have inserted into Obamacare is very dark.
           </p>
           <p>
            The WHO whose top donors, Gates and Rockefeller, are top Clinton donors as well, allegedly inserted this section on beheadings and other forms of mass murder into Obamacare as forms of "legal execution" under what sounds like a martial law.
            <br/>

            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            Their inserting anything into US law would be illegal, wouldn't it?  And then, if it's real, it seems to be a pre-legalization of various means of mass murders.
           </p>
           <p>
            And there is one very strange item called "specified means" - which is left unspecified.  What would be so awful it's worse than beheadings? Could it be satanic murders, infanticide, and cannabilism (of babies)?
           </p>
           <p>
            The WHO and UNICEF (WHO and UN) are using diseases as a means to get vaccine teams (with CIA agents) into areas they want into militarily.

            But they are also creating diseases and quarantining people, in a way clearing areas like has been done with sarin gas, and with oil nearby.  The disease "outbreak" and phony death numbers becomes a justification to bring in US troops to "help" (thought they only built bases).

            These are almost all controlled by CF donors.  Rockefeller's son ran the US Doctors without Borders until he died in an unexplained plane crash right after visiting his father shortly before Doctors without Borders became the lead group pushing ebola as a pandemic (anything less didn't warrant troops and a take over of West Africa).

            Obamacare needs to be checked into.  If real, it would be devastating to those organizations which wrote it and whoever got it inserted.  And somewhere there would be information of what the undefined means of execution are that are so much worst than beheadings they need to be hidden.

             I've been trying to get people to look into the fact that former CIA employee Edward Snowden leaked against the NSA while contracting for them and news articles talked about the leaks pointed to the NSA being out of their jurisdiction by looking into foreign governments and CHARITIES like UNICEF. I really think this should be thoroughly looked into.

             All I can say, is it's curious that finally, apparently a bunch of ppl on the r_the/Donald  "alternative right," for lack of better description, are now finally hip to the evil that are "vaccinations," just as the crunchy, preventative hippy/earthy, progressive, natural "libtard," healers have been saying for eons. This is a good sign. We need to PROVE one of these ppl has directly benefitted from sexual exploitation of a child via Military industrialist complex in order to awaken, or as ppl here are finding of writing "woke," which is poor grammer btw), AS MANY PPL AS POSSIBEL. We need to assemble letter to Gowdy, get  subpoenas, and fix this shit. Remain awake. Awakened.

             How? I'm really intrigued. I honestly never heard of the case before. A quick search seems to show the killer targets adult female prostitutes. How does it work into PG?

             Mr. Webb connects LISK to people with diplomatic passports, the law can't reach them, but the public does....?
