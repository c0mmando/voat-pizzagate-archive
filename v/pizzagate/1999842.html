<p>This relates to pizzagate because the Jesuits are an elite organization controlling factions of our government and they\'re involved in many pedophilia cases.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In 2014 the NYT published an article titled <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/24/world/americas/whisked-away-vatican-ambassador-accused-of-sexual-abuse-of-minors.html">For Nuncio Accused of Abuse, Dominicans Want Justice at Home, Not Abroad</a>. The article discussed Archbishop Jozef Wesolowski, the Vatican ambassador who serves as a personal envoy of the pope, being accused of sexually abusing minors in the Dominican Republic.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“He definitely seduced me with money,” said Francis Aquino Aneury, who says he was 14 when the man he met shining shoes began offering him increasingly larger sums for sexual acts. “I felt very bad. I knew it wasn’t the right thing to do, but I needed the money.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is what the Jesuit leader, William (Bill) Donovan of the Catholic league had to say about this article..</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Times erred again by repeating the myth of a pedophilia scandal: 100 percent of the victimizers were male; 81 percent of the victims were male; and 78 percent were postpubescent. That would make it a homosexual scandal. Indeed, less than 5 percent of these cases involve pedophilia.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This particular comment made me dig a little further on this guy because even if his numbers are true, he\'s obviously willing to overlook the 22% of prepubescent children who were molested to defend a Jesuit pedophile. What I found is going to sound real familiar to the regulars here.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Here are some things &quot;we know that we know&quot; about William Donohue: he has been president of the Catholic League for Religious and Civil Rights for nearly twenty years; he\'s quick to accuse anyone criticizing the Catholic hierarchy as being a Catholic-basher; he relishes publicity -- always ready for his Fox News Channel close-up; he\'s a stalwart defender of all things Catholic; he\'s gruff and likes to throw his weight around; <strong>he\'s mean-spirited and prone to making outrageous comments; he\'s a serial gay-basher; he has been a staunch apologist for priestly child abuse, claiming it was the result of having homosexual priests; and, he has a predilection for dumping on Jews.</strong></p>
<p>Donohue slams Rabbi Waskow</p>
<p>Last week, BuzzFeed had an interesting little story about Donohue. BuzzFeed\'s story revolved around a &quot;private email&quot; he sent to Philadelphia Rabbi Arthur Waskow.</p>
<p>According to BuzzFeed, Waskow, a progressive political activist, author, and a Rabbi associated with the Jewish Renewal movement, &quot;had criticized the Vatican and the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops in a Huffington Post op-ed for `attacking the religious freedom of millions of American women and the religious freedom of American nuns\' over contraception.&quot;</p>
<p>In response to Waskow\'s piece, Donohue sent him an email calling the piece a &quot;snide attack on the Catholic Church&quot; that &quot;exhibits appalling ignorance.&quot; Donohue ended his note with: &quot;Moreover, since when is it the business of any religious leader to condemn the strictures of another religion? You are not only clueless about the situation concerning nuns, you have stuck your nose in where you don\'t belong.&quot;</p>
<p>How\'s that for launching a civil dialogue?</p>
<p>Donohue\'s email started a brief exchange, which ended by citing his friendship with former New York City Mayor Ed Koch, who, according to Donohue &quot;once said that Jews had better not make enemies of their Catholic friends since they have so few of them. Think about that the next time you feel compelled to attack my religion. Donohue also included a postscript saying, `I do not have a long nose.\'&quot;</p>
<p>Donohue has been down this rage-against-the-Jews road many time: In 2004, Donohue, a major admirer of Mel Gibson\'s movie &quot;The Passion of the Christ,&quot; expressed his displeasure with the Hollywood Foreign Press Association for snubbing Gibson\'s film. In typical Donohue style, he said: &quot;Mel Gibson releases the most significant blockbuster movie of the year, but it\'s not good enough to make the cut for a Golden Globe. That\'s because his film promotes Christianity, and the Hollywood crowd will have none of it. The only movies they like to make about Christianity these days are ones that demean it.&quot;</p>
<p>In December 2004, Donohue told fellow defender-of-the-faith, Pat Buchanan, who was subbing for host Joe Scarborough on MSNBC\'s &quot;Scarborough Country,&quot; that the reason &quot;The Passion&quot; wouldn\'t get its just due is because &quot;Hollywood is controlled by secular Jews who hate Christianity in general and Catholicism in particular. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>I\'ve proven recently, what I\'ve know for years, that it\'s the Jesuits controlling the &quot;game&quot; across the board. This is more proof that it\'s not the Jews that you can\'t talk about, it\'s the Jesuits. William Donahue has made MANY appearances on &quot;Jew controlled media&quot;. Why would that happen if the media is really Jew controlled?</p>

            I'm no expert when you get into the bloodline Illuminati stuff.  And I don't care.  I deal in current events with relevance to recent, provable history.
           </p>
           <p>
            Here is my take.  The Jesuits and the secret societies are intertwined.  These same secret societies are also prevalent at the Ivy League schools.  All of these entities are intertwined and joined at the hip.
           </p>

            What I can tell you is this.  Here are the D/CIA from Obama to today:

                But seeing the shit he gets, for posting truths, I can understand his frustration.  I would definitely try harder, personally, to keep my cool, because I know that it doesn't convince anyone of anything when you start freaking out.

                What I wouldn't do is try to rile up an agitated person, for my own enjoyment.  Except if I was trying to get them to discredit themselves (I wouldn't aim to discredit someone I agree with, obviously).

             Lets just air it all out in this thread pedo Jesuit. I created it so you could STFU after this is over. The modern day masterminds of your Jewish propaganda are the Rothschild family, they're the ones who created the Jewish State of Isreal. But, we know who they really are...
            </p>
            <blockquote>
             <p>
              "Recorded in the spellings of de Rothschild, Rothchild, Rothschild and Rothchilt, this is a famous surname of Austro-German origins. It is said to have been habitational, and to originate from a house or houses which had a red shield as the doormarker, and this may well be so. Before the advent of street numbering it was the popular practice to designate a property by some form of display. In time the only properties that continued with the practise were inns and hotels. Most early recordings of the name are protestant, a few Catholic, and sometimes Jewish, and this multplicity of religions can cause confusion, but in fact has nothing to do with the origin. The famous banking family of Rothschild traces its origins back to a Meyer Rothschild, born in Frankfurt in 1743. As to what this family were called prior to this time is unclear, but it is almost certain that Rothschild was a name adopted by them. Prior to this date they would almost certainly have been refugees from the Turkish Empire or Middle Europe.
              <strong>
               Early examples of the surname recording taken from surviving German church registers of the period include: Simon Rothschild, who was christened at Bantrupe evangelical church, Lippe, on April 29th 1714, and Edmund Rothchild, christened at Burgsteirfurt katholic church, Westfalen, on July 14th 1813."

             The claim is that their prior surname was Bauer, so lets go over that too so you don't cry.

              Bauer- "Origins Available: Danish, German
             </p>
             <p>
              The historical and enchanting region of Austria is the birthplace of the distinguished family name Bauer. Austria, which was originally home to a Celtic people, was conquered by the Roman Empire in about 15 BC. Following the fall of Rome, Austria was repeatedly invaded by barbarian tribes, such as the Vandals, Visigoths, and Huns, who swept in from the east. During the 5th and 6th centuries, the Alemanni, Avars and Slavs settled Austria. The Avars were defeated in 785 by the Frankish emperor Charlemagne, who set up the East Mark, which later became known as the Österreich. Otto I defeated the Magyars in 955. Austria was ruled by the Babenburger dynasty until 1278, when they were succeeded by the Hapsburg dynasty, which ruled Austria until the 20th century.

              Bauer Early Origins
             </p>
             <p>
              The surname Bauer was first found in Austria and Bavaria, where the name contributed greatly to the development of an emerging nation which would later play a large role in the tribal and national conflicts of the area. In later years the name branched into many houses, each playing a significant role in the local social and political affairs.

              During this period prominent bearers of the name Bauer were Bruno Bauer (1809-1882), who was a controversial German theologian, historian, and student of Hegel. Ludwig Amandus Bauer (1803-1846)..."

                LOL, that is not 'established'!
               </p>
               <p>
                But why would it be important any way, to target the Rothschilds OR the Jesuits?  If the Jesuits are guilty of nefarious activity (which they are) it has to be exposed, and if the Rothschilds are guilty of nefarious activity (which they are) it has to be exposed.   This isn't some sort of 'conspiracy theory civil war' where two sides have to battle for 'who is correct'.
               </p>
               <p>
                Any way, its well known that the founders of the Jesuits, Ignatius Loyola, was a crypto-Jew.  As were many of the early Jesuits.
               </p>
               <p>
                Those at the top currently are kabbalists, and Zionists.  That is their religion, occult practice centered on the Kabbalah.
               </p>
               <p>
                The famous quote by Vladimir Lenin illustrates my point, "The best way to control the opposition is to lead it ourselves".  So ultimately, I think we can settle on the point that it is indisputable that the Rothschilds and Jesuits work together.  Who 'controls' who is ultimately irrelevant, because it doesn't matter.  Both need to be exposed, and stopped in their agendas.

                  I think you are just being obtuse.  Whether you are actively spreading disinformation is yet to be determined.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  You have not established what you are saying you have established, which is that 'the Jesuits control the Rothschilds'.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  Your link to the Jewish Encyclopaedia.... Have you even checked the link you are providing?  I don't see anything about the Jesuits or the Rothschilds on that page.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  It is well known that the Rothschilds have been in charge of Vatican finances since the early 19th century.   The Rothschild's involvement with the Bavarian Illuminati is also well known.  But that doesn't mean 'the Jesuits control the Rothschilds'.   It does mean the two groups have a history of working together.   That is probably how you should be explaining it to people going forward (IMO).

                <blockquote>
                 <p>
                  In October of 1907 several banking firms, starting with the Knickerbocker Trust Company of New York, collapsed as depositors withdrew funds for fear of unwise investments and misuse of money. Lines of people waited in front of the Knickerbocker to close their accounts. Days later, the Trust Company of America had droves of depositors removing their money. Then, shortly thereafter, a run took place at the Lincoln Trust Company. Across the country apprehension that the panic would continue to spread occurred. In the fall of 1907 the United States was in a recession, it's banking system lacked a lender of last resort mechanism, and an intricate network of directorships, loans, and collateral bonded the fate of many financial institutions together.

                  Several banking leaders including Jekyll Island Club members George F. Baker, president of the First National Bank, and James Stillman, president of National City Bank, met with financier J. Pierpont Morgan and began examining the assets of the troubled institutions. A decision was made to offer loans to any of the banks that were solvent. The secretary of the treasury George B. Cortelyou was eager to divert the situation and offered the New York bankers use of government funds to help prevent an economic disaster. President Theodore Roosevelt, while the panic of 1907 transpired, was on a hunting trip in Louisiana.

Ron Chernow in his book The Death of the Banker offers this account of the 1907 Panic, "In the following days, acting like a one-man Federal Reserve system, [J. Pierpont] Morgan decided which firms would fail and which survive. Through a non stop flurry of meetings, he organized rescues of banks and trust companies, averted a shutdown of the New York Stock Exchange, and engineered a financial bailout of New York City." In the end, the panic was blocked and several young bankers including Henry P. Davison and Benjamin Strong Jr. were recognized for their work organizing personnel and determining the liquidity of the banks involved in the crises. In 1908 J. Pierpont Morgan asked Henry P. Davison to become a partner in his firm J. P. Morgan &amp; Co. and in 1914 Benjamin Strong Jr. was selected to be the first president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.

                  Soon after the 1907 panic, Congress formed the National Monetary Commission to review banking policies in the United States. The committee, chaired by Senator Nelson W. Aldrich of Rhode Island, toured Europe and collected data on the various banking methods being incorporated. Using this information as a base, in November of 1910 Senator Aldrich invited several bankers and economic scholars to attend a conference on Jekyll Island. While meeting under the ruse of a duck-shooting excursion, the financial experts were in reality hunting for a way to restructure America's banking system and eliminate the possibility of future economic panics.

                 <p>
                  The 1910 "duck hunt" on Jekyll Island included Senator Nelson Aldrich, his personal secretary Arthur Shelton, former Harvard University professor of economics Dr. A. Piatt Andrew, J.P. Morgan &amp; Co. partner Henry P. Davison, National City Bank president Frank A. Vanderlip and Kuhn, Loeb, and Co. partner Paul M. Warburg. From the start the group proceeded covertly. They began by shunning the use of their last names and met quietly at Aldrich's private railway car in New Jersey. In 1916, B. C. Forbes discussed the Jekyll conference in his book Men Who Are Making America and illuminates, "To this day these financiers are Frank and Harry and Paul [and Piatt] to one another and the late Senator remained 'Nelson' to them until his death. Later [, following the Jekyll conference,] Benjamin Strong, Jr., was called into frequent consultation and he joined the 'First-Name Club' as 'Ben.'" This book as well as a magazine article by Forbes is the only public mention to the conference until around 1930, when Paul Warburg's book The Federal Reserve System: Its Origin and Growth and Nathaniel Wright Stephenson's book Nelson W. Aldrich: A Leader in American Politics were published.

                  Train Station in Brunswick, Georgia
Nathaniel Stephenson, in the Notes section of his biography on Senator Aldrich, suggests that B.C. Forbes learned of the Jekyll conference from an incident taking place at the Brunswick train depot. Stephenson writes, "In the station at Brunswick, Ga., where they ostentatiously talked of sport, the station master gave them a start. 'Gentleman,' said he, 'this is all very pretty, but I must tell you we know who you are and the reporters are waiting outside.' But Mr. Davison was not flustered. 'Come out, old man,' said he, 'I will tell you a story.' They went out together. When Mr. Davison returned he was smiling. 'That's all right,' said he, 'they won't give us away.' The rest is silence. The reporters disappeared and the secret of the strange journey was not divulged. No one asked him how he managed it and he did not volunteer the information." From the Brunswick train station the men boarded a boat and traveled on to Jekyll Island.

                  The Jekyll Island conference offered a secluded location to discuss banking ideas and enabled the development of a plan that eventually became the Federal Reserve Banking System. The Federal Reserve System is the name given to the twelve central banks regulating America's banking industry and it insures that depositors will not lose their money in the event of funds mismanagement from an accredited bank. Paul Warburg in his book The Federal Reserve System: Its Origin and Growth explains the reason for secrecy behind the meeting. He states, "It is well to remember that the period during which these discussions took place was the time of the struggle of the financial Titans- the period of big combinations [of businesses], with bitter fights for control. All over the country there was a deep feeling of fear and suspicion with regard to Wall Street's power and ambitions."

                  Obtaining permission from J. Pierpont Morgan to use the facilities of the Jekyll Island Club, the conference attendees most likely resided in the clubhouse for about ten days. The meeting required long days and late nights of contemplation and reflection. European banking practices were assessed and numerous conversations held regarding the best way to craft a non-partisan banking reform bill. Paul Warburg in the book Henry P. Davison: The Record of a Useful Life recalls, "After we had completed the sketch of the bill, and before setting down to its definitive formulation, it was decided that we had earned 'a day off' which was to be devoted to duck shooting." The Jekyll Island Club was originally formed in 1886 as a hunting preserve and in the 1910s was well stocked with animals such as pheasants and wild hogs. Several ponds on the island attracted numerous game birds and wild ducks.

                 <p>
                  View from water tower toward Indian Mound Cottage William Barton McCash and June Hall McCash in the book The Jekyll Island Club: Southern Haven for America's Millionaires offers this narrative of the Jekyll conference. They mention, "How long the surreptitious meeting lasted is uncertain, although the group spent Thanksgiving on the island, where they dined on 'wild turkey with oyster stuffing.' They worked throughout the day and night, taking only sporadic time out to explore Jekyl and enjoy its delights. Aldrich and Davison were both so taken with...[Jekyll Island]... that they joined the club in 1912."
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  For years members of the Jekyll Island Club would recount the story of the secret meeting and by the 1930s the narrative was considered a club tradition. The conference's solution to America's banking problems called for the creation of a central bank. Although Congress did not pass the reform bill submitted by Senator Aldrich, it did approve a similar proposal in 1913 called the Federal Reserve Act. The Federal Reserve System of today mirrors in essence the plan developed on Jekyll Island in 1910.

            Agree wholeheartedly. The Jesuits control the game from inside the Vatican. They are in fact the false Jews that are spoken about. There is a ton of Jew hate spewed. Speaking of the Jesuits and explaining how they are the controlling faction is key.Always has been.

             Judaism not only predates but is the basis for both Christianity and Islam. Jesus Christ the savior of the Christians, second to last prophet of the Muslims, was born and died a Jew. The Koran equates the Jewish God Jehova as being Allah (Satan) and accepts the entire Christ story. Only 0.2% of the world’s population is Jewish, but Judaism is the foundation for Christianity, the biggest, most believed religion in the world with 33% of the world’s population following it, and the basis for Islam, the second biggest, most believed religion with 23% of the world following it. The followers of the Judeo-Christian-Muslim mythos therefore are fundamentally all under a form of Jewish mind control. The papacy, world royalty, and Zionist Jewry all claim their “divine right to rule” from their Old Testament Jewish God. Big name Christian televangelists and authors are constantly defending Israel and zealously encouraging Christians to support the Jewish holyland.

             Now for the HOLY SMOKES....
            </p>
            <p>
             Ignatius Loyola, the founder of the Jesuits was Jewish, Adam Weishaupt the founder of the Illuminati was Jewish, and Karl Marx the founder of communism, the greatest vehicle of democide in modern history was Jewish. Even the Pope and all his Vatican cardinals wear their little Jew hats (yarmulkes).

can't focus on the jews for hundreds of years, while the same shit repeats throughout history and think we are on the right path, without looking like a complete retard.

              Really? I thought that the "victors wrote history". This is just more proof you're shilling for Jesuits. Certainly the Jews aren't going to write into history that they have been expelled from all these countries if they had control over shit like re-writing WWII.

              You and your language calling me a bitch. It has become amusing as we all watch you crumble under your own lies. It is also such as an easy process to bait you. Once again "Fly Fishing" Could have guaranteed you would attack this post with your Jewish hatred of course followed by insults like "bitch" you sound like a spoiled teenager whose vocabulary is so limited your own response it to CAPITALIZE juvenile swear words and threaten to hunt down those that disagree with you with death threats stating "I am the Law" Unbeknownst to you apparently the real law is also part of this forum. Your threats have been taking seriously. When they knock on your door say Hi before you confess. Though knocking might be a rather quick event before they are standing in your home. Good luck to you.

                 Jews are TPTB because they DEMONSTRABLY control the relevant industries of foreign policy lobbying, entertainment, news media, art collecting, and international banking, sexual blackmail AMONG OTHERS.  They also have been consistently accused of sacrificing children and have a high rate of pedophilia and mental disorders.  LOOKIN PRETTY GOOD FOR MY THEORY, WHAT DO YOU HAVE ON THR JESUITS LMAOOOO

                   Dude you are SO STUPID for thinking ANYONE would believe your story over the MUCH MORE INTUITIVE JEW THEORY WHICH PREDATES THE JESUITS BY MILLENNIA! "But obama and Coney went to school there" LMAO! FUCKING LOSER SHILLS.

                   YOU CAN'T MUDDY THE WATERS WITH RELIGIOUS BULLSHIT -- THE JEWS ARE RACIAL SUPREMACISTS WHO INFILTRATE A SOCIETY AND PUSH TO IMPORT MORE FOREIGNERS TO DILUTE THE MAJORITY AND DOMINATE.  IN EVERY COUNTRY YOU FIND THEM EXCEPT ISRAEL OF COURSE.

                    The only problem with your Jews being expelled from multiple countries story is that you idiots forgot that you claim Jews rewrote history after WWII to include the Holocaust. Why would they leave all their nefarious acts? "The victor writes the history." Remember?

                    Muddy the waters with religious bullshit? Jesuits aren't Catholic, they're hiding behind them too. The Jesuits are a luciferian order taking advantage of a lot of good people. Here's the proof you're the one throwing bullshit in the water.

                        Ignorant racists? Most were Masons, so you're calling them Jews who were playing us from the jump. You claim the Masons have been a Jewish conspiracy from the get go. I recognize the masons were infiltrated by the likes of Albert Pike and his luciferian Jesuit buddies.

                          Since you're just chasing your tail I'm going to point something out.. I know you like to pretend you're the one who gets censored here, but you always fail to state a direct link to pizzagate and that's why your threads get deleted. This thread isn't deleted, but it's completly missing from the "hot" algorithm. There's even 4 month old archived threads on the front page, including one with only 12 upvotes. It also has 4 downvotes and a whopping 7 comments.

                           yes, seems to me the backend of this forum is being picked over, items shadow banned, disappeared far from the prying eyes of the public.  We are both the enemy and the crowd sourced intel.  All speculation on my part but what else is left when you see the traces of evidence.
                          </p>
                          <p>
                           This forum has never been right and the most amazing thing is the continual "normalcy bias" of everyone that comes here including me that somehow posting on pizzagate voat is a reasonable or hopeful thing to do.  On the other hand, it is better than caring for 1 second about Beyonce, et al.

                            I would expect the same if I started blaming innocent Catholics for the Luciferian Jesuit problem.

                            The others in this thread and I have already proven to you that the Jesuits control the Jews and everything else through the Rothschilds and you have nothing but "trust me it's the Jews". Piss off with your bullshit.

                              What? LOL I was pointing out a high level Jesuit blaming the Jews, as usual. You should really get off the crack. You have nothing but a mouth full of bullshit. It seems like you follow Donohues policy perfectly.

                               Let me explain: because you are a SHILL OF EXTEMELY LIMITED INTELLIGENCE you did not realize that by saying the Jews act in concert AT THE BEHEST OF JESUITS OR NOT you conceded that they can be targeted even as mere footsoldiers.

                               From there it's one small step to realize they're not footsoldiers at all.  In fact, 95% of the most influential and wealthy players are Jews, and then you can't UNSEE IT WHICH IS WHAT YOU'RE SCARED OF

                  The Jesuits control education, military elite, prestigious schools of Academia where MK Ultra Project Paper Clip was secretly conducing. They are also involved in International banking, sexual blackmail and many trained CIA operatives are Jesuits all the way to the former head of the CIA. They have been accused of child sacrifice, pedophelia, money laundering, etc. some of them have been found guilty. They are brought to Vatican City and protected when their horrified crimes are exposed. The top Universities where Podesta, Comey, obama are all trained are Jesuit organizations. The Jesuits were involved in the JFK assasination. The Knights of Malta is part of the Jesuit arm of the Vatican. They have their own island and had diplomatic immunity. They were recently brought back directly under Pope Francis (Jesuit) into the legal protection of the Holy See. The leaders of this country and many CIA are Jesuits.

            LMAO! Is that why your thread about a religious group stays up and all mine today have been deleted within THREE MINUTES? Your shilling is PATHETIC BRO!

            You pasted a buzzfeed article and didn't even add a rebuttal to the quotes!
           </p>
           <p>
            ALL the founders of the big 8 Hollywood studios were born within 200 miles of each other in Eastern Europe, of course they despised Christians for persecuting them!  Name a pro-christian or for that matter pro-European movie, you couldn't even do that! LMAO youre proving my points for me, what a stupid ASSHOLE!

             So... Is it DonKeyhote or is it Don Quixote the Crazy Jesuit crusader?
            </p>
            <blockquote>
             <p>
              Don Quixote–The Crazy Crusader
             </p>
             <p>
              The book is now considered a masterpiece and the world’s first novel. It has been translated into more languages than any other book in the world except the Bible. Its first English translation was published in 1612, only one year after the world_famed King James Bible. Set in Cervantes’ native Spain long after the Crusades were over, Don Quixote revives the crusading spirit, the search for meaning and purpose in life, the nature and reality of truth, the relativity of judgment, and values and depth of character.
