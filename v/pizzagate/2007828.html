             Unfortunately I am absolutely no good on computers, so don't know how to do that. The only thing I can advise is if you share just tell your friends to stop at a certain time because the language is not good, especially as it is at the end it might be helpful.  If it is anywhere else you can say to skip that section as the info is good but embarrassing because of the language.  Unfortunately this seems to be this generations everyday language, I must admit I have begun to get a bit numb to it whereas I was shocked a few months ago, think it is not a good thing, but its prevalent everywhere now -  sadly.

            Super rad video brah. This turd thinks his little msm organized psy-op made it all just go away. Must be some hellish times inside Alefantis head wondering when the farm is going to send by their own cleaners.

            Mr. G you hit some pretty prominent power points into the investigation of this WikiLeaks exposed clandestine agent. The arts and embassy program is the lead I believe is most intriguing, unfettered shipping access to ports around the world, in combination with this mans  'artistic tastes' and acquaintances, seems almost so ridiculously plausible as to be absurdly true.
           </p>
           <p>
            As an example of how absurd the MSM clinged on to a few initial hyperinflated claims (made by intelligence agents posing on our own forums as to make it appear absurd) by making it sound like hillary clinton wearing an apron was serving children on a platter in the basement.

            Her and Bill's operation was to COMPROMISE and ENLIST as many politicians and  rich industrialist donors to run their weapons for drugs and vice versa black market and  terrorist subversion cells around the world just as the clinton foundation's PARENT organization the Bush Cartel and the nazi's before them.

             - it most definitly will not stay hidden by the MSM very soon.  I see today they asked Sessions if he was going to retire because President Trump wished he had told him before the appointment that he was going to recuse himself from the Russian Investigation.  I don't think Pres. T could fire Sessions, he seems all humble and quiet, but I personally think he is a pitbull inside and has waited all these years to get these sickos out of government and off the streets into jail......ever since Joe Biden tried to 'touch' his little grand daughter.......still one of my favourite videos....... I never even knew or heard of Sessions before he was appointed AG, hes on a mission to get them, mark my word!!

            this is actually a VERY well put together video and it deserves some attention. I have been here literally since the beginning (since we got kicked off
            <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/pizzagate">
             r/pizzagate
            </a>
            ) and somehow I didn't know that Comet Ping Pong somehow has a full bar that is not separated yet allows minors inside. That alone is suspicious imo.
           </p>
           <p>
            edit: some of it is incorrect. that photo of the security guard asleep next to the pornographic image is a piece by Jeff Koons, whose ex-wife is an Italian former adult film star - it's of her, it's not "allegedly uncensored child porn." Now that said, Jeff Koons is himself extremely suspicious and has actually been accused of child abuse by his ex-wife. You'll find plenty more on Koons in this subverse if you search.

             Thank you for the information about the security guard asleep, do you have a link I can send to Mr.Gunk explaining that please? I am sure he would like to know and mention it in his clip.  Also, I have been on voat almost from the beginning of this pizzagate, and knew the pic was by Jeff Koons but had not heard who the 'child' was. That is good to know its not a child!! Thanks again.

              - apparently Jeff Koons has claimed the photo is of his ex-wife, but people question the veracity of that statement due to differences between that photo and the many other available nude photos of his ex-wife (since she was an adult film star). Personally I'm not exactly inclined to try and "compare" lol.

 NEVER seen or heard of this before - someone SHOULD DO IT on MSM with a video like the Dr. Gunk one with the photos MSM chose NOT TO SHOW! It has 5,626,593 views !!!!!!!!!!! This is unbelievable.  I hope this happens - oh ho I should not say 'hope' it got President Trump into a whole lot of trouble 'hoping' Flinn/Russian conspiracy could go away haha

             My thoughts exactly, who the fuck in the entire country runs a pizza joint like this? Every undercover and plainclothes cop in my town or anywhere else would be up in the place looking for underage, underage drinkers and drug use and CPS would be in there quick as shit taking children away to foster homes because mom and dad take me to a gay bar so they can have drinks and shit pizza. Something never seemed right about this place regardless of the sugar coating the mainstream news tried to put on it.
            </p>
            <p>
             There's enough proof just in this video as the young girl dances and the adults sip their drinks to warrant  an investigation into suspected parental neglect.

             That picture actually isn't shown in the "Made in Heaven" photo shoot Koons made with his wife.  That is what I thought it was as well until someone pointed out that it wasn't in the gallery.  Of course, I hope that is where it is from though.

              Interesting. I didn't go as far as to actually check the gallery. Hmm. Maybe that deserves more looking into, Koons is definitely involved in some nefarious stuff.

             . That would be fantastic if it did go viral, nd soooo easy to show to anyone and so easily understood. The more people who know the greater the swell of support, like a kind of 'pay it forward' - only takes a few people to pass it to a few people who pass that on, the multiplication would be phenomenal.  I only came across Mr.Gunk a few weeks ago, his channel is very, very interesting, and he seems to have a heart for those being taken advantage of. Love it.

            As much as we would all love to see these evil bastards go down, their ability to contort any murder investigation will make it near impossible. We would love to see them hang, but Sessions and Trump would have to attack it ferociously. With people like these, one would have to have all the pieces in place and drop the hammer at just the right time to get them all with their hands in the cookie jar to make it stick.
