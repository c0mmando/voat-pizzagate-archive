            Trump was gathering military leaders on the news North Korea is preparing a new missile.  I wish it was about fighting some of the evil in DC, but it's almost certainly just more war for the MIC.

            Trump will not drain shit and most likely compramised himself. the VP Pence supposedly runs a pedo ring, according to a guy who predicted his own  death (assasination) which happened last year

            He could be talking about what's about to happen to him.
           </p>
           <p>
            I really am not holding out any hope. I started out very optimistic, but now? I don't see anything happening. Anytime a date's given, nothing happens. I mean, it's October ... nothing! And Hannity .... tick, tick, tick, .... WHA'? What's it mean? Nothing. Even Assange promised something, so where is it? And now this LV thing. Again, NOTHING done to prove it was anything other than a deranged lone shooter which it was not!
           </p>
           <p>
            All I see is Trump getting clobbered and no real headway. Answering back is just a schoolyard game. If people aren't arrested and charged with irrefutable evidence, it means nothing.
           </p>
           <p>
            I'd love to be proven wrong, but there's nothing there.

             Hard to have hope when Trump is surrounded by the swamp creatures he would need to drain the swamp... he’s literally powerless unless there are some who could help him. But you know he’s pretty much alone in this fight

              In my more optimistic moments, I tend to see the PR about him being alone as more propaganda meant to demoralize us ... but also to throw off The Pedophile Elite. Depends which day you catch me on.

             Tick Tock could be related to the Assange evidence... or possibly the Awan/DNC/Congress developments. Who knows?
            </p>
            <p>
             As for Assange delivering his "promise" - he'll make good on that as soon as he gets his pardon. It is evidence contingent on a pardon.
            </p>
            <p>
             Trump is getting clobbered, and there's not much runway for him at all, but I don't think that is related to arrests/indictments/evidence bubbling up.
            </p>
            <p>
             Patience is a virtue. Keep in mind how MASSIVE this all is, IF it is all related. Even if the situations I listed above are all completely contained in a vacuum from one another, this is an undertaking on an enormous scale we've never seen before. Trump is tasked with immediately taking them down? Against a huge opposition and people "on his side" also trying to handcuff and silence him?
            </p>
            <p>
             If the take-downs are rushed, we could be cutting off a head or two from the hydra... I'm holding out hope that they're planning to lop off all of the heads at one time. Otherwise, they'll retreat/regroup and we'll be right back to square one in a year or two... with even more secrecy behind their iron curtain.
            </p>
            <p>
             To say there's "nothing there" is not even possible. The leaks sitting on Wikileaks.com alone for over a year would be enough for them to charge Trump with treason, collusion, obstruction of justice, destruction of evidence and have him impeached. And we haven't even seen the worst of those emails... yet, the perpetrators skip around like they did nothing wrong. Like they didn't compromise classified information. Like they didn't have a pedophile without security clearance print out Top Secret documents. Like they didn't use bleach bit to cover their tracks... destroy blackberries and hard drives to cover their tracks...
            </p>
            <p>
             There is something there. The powers that be are simply applying intense pressure to keep it contained. We can only hope that Trump is using the DOJ to set a high volume of bear traps to snap shut at the exact same time.

               To say there's "nothing there" is not even possible. The leaks sitting on Wikileaks.com alone for over a year would be enough for them to charge Trump with treason, collusion, obstruction of justice, destruction of evidence and have him impeached. And we haven't even seen the worst of those emails... yet, the perpetrators skip around like they did nothing wrong. Like they didn't compromise classified information. Like they didn't have a pedophile without security clearance print out Top Secret documents. Like they didn't use bleach bit to cover their tracks... destroy blackberries and hard drives to cover their tracks..

              This is all true, but you misunderstood the context of "there's nothing there." I didn't mean if from the standpoint of The Cannibal Elite. They're clearly there, the crimes they committed, and the hold they secured by blackmail is definitely there. I was talking about the evidence or whatever it will take to bring them down. I just don't see it. They have Awan, they had Weiner and still have his computer, and there's not enough evidence there? Really?
             </p>
             <p>
              And I agree, to be taken seriously, they'd have to go after someone big like HRC and Podesta. That would shake things up and definitely cause that storm alluded to, but there needs to be "evidence." It can't be a witch hunt of flimsy because then the POTUS will get more raked over by the press. No, it has to be something so solid that not even HRC and her minions can wriggle out of prison time.
             </p>
             <p>
              It just seems hopeless. There we are digging and screaming, "Pedo!" And Scalise takes a bullet, and then LV is staged.
             </p>
             <p>
              I do want those pedos in prison. They're not only pedos, they're traitors to their country. They tried to corrupt the justice system and government just so they could carry on, and they've succeeded.

               I guess that's my point. If they JUST take down a big name, it gives all of the other top/middle/small players in their network a huge warning shot to scramble/delete/run/regroup... If anything is going to happen with this, they need to drop the hammer on everyone, all at once. Crushing as many Elites, Politicians, Hollywood, Religious figures and all CP networks at once.

               Yep, they have all of that, plus more of Hillary's emails, potentially the leaked content of the PG secret server, life insurance files, and who knows what else? My point here is the same as the above... until they are ready to strike, do you really think law enforcement/DOJ should be running around screaming "WE GOT NEW EVIDENCE! LOOK! EVERYONE! CHECK IT OUT!"... again, they could be keeping their cards close to the chest for a massive take-down.

               Assange has confirmed he's sitting on a shit-ton of evidence/leaks that either relate directly or indirectly to what we're researching. Why is he holding back? For the Russian proof, he's holding it for a pardon. For the remaining HRC emails (which he confirmed they have), perhaps he was instructed by the DOJ that under no circumstances should these be leaked, based on their ongoing efforts. If he didn't believe them or had reason to believe they were NOT moving ahead, I have full faith that Assange will dumb what he has to light a fire under the Deep State.

                No, I do not think that, but the frustration level is still high. You have ANTIFA going nuts, Scalise shot, the staged shooting in LV, the idiot San Juan mayor soaking up her ten minutes of lunacy ... oh, and they even leaked Trump's interview with Stern. The media is hyping and NOT going after known pedophiles and The Cannibal Elite?

                I think there's more to it than that. I think they're deliberately waiting for the the investigation to conclude to spring the evidence. Think about it. Anyone brought in there is under oath so if Assange really has the goods, and these idiots (like Podesta) is lying under oath ... uh oh! A nice big takedown with very little effort expended.

            I'm hopeful.  Celebrating a military action with a dinner before would be bad bad bad...especially if anything went wrong....So, more likely now its a criminal/law enforcement action .....But w/ military brass there....Which criminal probes might involve the military?  I think its related to Pizzagate or criminality among members of the prior administration.   Or not.  Still, hopeful.

             Yes, let's blow up the North Koreans because of Rocketman's rhetoric and because he tests nukes. (Meanhile, we have conducted thousands of nuke tests and sit on piles of missiles.)
            </p>
            <p>
             These are the people who will suffer because our national pride is hurt by Rocketman's threats:

             I expected better of Pizzagate people, but yahoos are the same everywhere. Let's blow up North Korea just like we blew up Iraq, Afghanistan and Syria. When the USG creates a bogeyman, we all fall into line. Disgusting.

               "Taking out evil dictators = globalist plan for domination of Middle East. Remove the powerful secular dictators like Saddam, Gadhafi and Assad, and the people, esp. the Christians, are ripe for the plucking.

               For your information, USG uses regime change and nation-building to facilitate human trafficking and exploitation of women and children in the countries we invade and occupy.

            There are so many storms brewing right now, it's hard to know what he's referencing... Awan Bro's, the DNC case, Russian dis-proof via Assange, Weiner/Abedin "flipping" info to the feds, HRC/Comey email investigation re-opened, Seth Rich reports demanded by DOJ...
           </p>
           <p>
            If somehow, they've got all their ducks in a line and break some Pizzagate/Pedogate related news/take down huge sections of the government, I would be shocked.

             Pressure Trump to investigate and expose the Root of all Evil in Racine, Wisconsin and then we will find out what side he is really on.

             When will everyone realize what is really going on here, and that there can never be justice in our corrupt and broken system? The only answer is to expose the world to the  real Truth.

               Racine, Wisconsin is the "Root" of all Evil and the model for the real agenda of Global Enslavement through the great deception of Sustainability (Satan's Ability) and the Mark of the Beast enforced by AI and Community Policing.
              </p>
              <p>
               Read our other comments. Masons are one of many, many groups involved of which Trump is a member. There is still hope that he repents and helps Save the world by exposing the real Truth about Racine, Wisconsin and the secret global agenda. The world needs to know the Truth, and Racine is Trump's ultimate Litmus Test.
