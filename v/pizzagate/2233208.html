            The human trafficking rat lines are distributed amongst the teeny towns in Texas. Who brings in most of the "refugees" to the states and distributes them to small towns? Churches. I have witnessed this in our small Texas towns. Small towns are a good place to hide. Sheriffs and police easy to buy. I know this our citizens know this and we have no control over it, the judges and local politicians are dirty most of the time. and secrets are kept.

             Yeah, it's interesting  how bad this post got trolled - 10 downvotes? And 4 accounts not familiar to this sub all posted immediately "nothing to see here you nutjob", and then upvoted each other's comments. Not only that, but my first attempt at posting this resulted in ALL the videos being deleted from youtube.
            </p>
            <p>
             If there's nothing to see here, why would the videos be deleted?
            </p>
            <p>
             I saw your comment about Masons just after the OP of the video noted that the flag in the church is Masonic
            </p>
            <p>
             One commenter, "Note The GOLD FRINGED FLAG. Only Used By FEDERAL GOVERNMENT &amp; MASONIC TEMPLES!﻿"
             <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fjrBiKa_gY">

             </a>
            </p>
            <p>
             She also notes that there are strange numbers being displayed. Others in the YT comments to her videos note - why videotape such boring sermons? Why do these videos have tens of thousands of views??? There is something going on, and it pains me that this post is getting buried.

              well, there was a supposed shooting in Floorsville yesterday, but it was reported that it was a false report, but the VP was in town for Sutherland. Something strange is going on for sure, this is in my neck of the woods so I am interested. But I can tell you for a fact, that the small towns are infested with Cartel, Human trafficking and tons of Refugees. the Churches are compromised and no one talks because they are either involved or afraid or unaware. We are talking DECADES upon decade of corruption. (BUSHES)

               Oh that makes sense. Wow. It's amazing this sub isn't more interested in this. I looked up "Masonic, Sutherland Springs" and it does seem they have a mighty large presence for such a small town.

            Video of woman who describes in great detail that the shots were coming through the roof of the church, through the ceiling. and down into the church. She seems pretty convincing. NBC links in link below.
           </p>
           <p>
            These are the types of videos I would expect to see from the vegas shooting, at a minimum several hundred of them, but I have not seen them flood onto the internet.

             That video of the wounded woman relating shots from above seems real. I believe this was a real crime, not a hoax or false flag, simply because the intervention of the lawfully armed citizens does not serve the gun-grab agenda.

              I thought about that too. Trump even said it was a good thing that somebody had a gun to shoot back with. In this particular event I have not gone digging for clues. I just passed on that video of the woman saying the shots came through the roof because that woman didn't seem like a typical crisis actor. If she is a crisis actor she didn't suck at it like most crisis actors do.
             </p>
             <p>
              Sometimes I go digging for minute clues until they add up to a story. In this case I have not done that. I have just sort of been watching what other people are dragging together.

             All of the videos posted immediately after the Vegas shooting were wiped clean off the internet, especially in the beginning. Excuse was that victims' relatives had not yet been identified. Concert goers all had their cell phones wiped clean as well before being returned to them. How can this be legal?
            </p>
            <p>
             I HAVE seen videos and extremely detailed reports, including a 3 hour recording from the Fire Dept, and various ones from Vegas Police Dept, all taken that very night. The best one is a compilation video from a British media source. Originally I and many others posted them on multiple threads on GLP.

              You keep repeating that but its just not true. People have free agency to post whatever they want to post. I watched closely and the type of videos I am looking for never surfaced. Gunshot wounds don't heal in a month. We should still be seeing new videos daily from wounded people from the vegas shooting. And NO all thousands of those people didn't get their phone wiped clean. This whole story you keep repeating is non starter.

               Have you actually gone on to GodLikeProductions and started reading any of the dozens of threads on 10/1? All are created by different people, some have over 100 posts.
              </p>
              <p>
               Would you like a link to an online Facebook page solely focused on 10/1 FACTS where each segment of the tragedy is debated? Included are copies of multiple police and fire dept scanners, each lasting several hours.
              </p>
              <p>
               Are you a shill or do you have your head buried in the sand? YES. I watched many, many videos online that were quickly deleted. Posters on every single YouTube site where 10/1 was discussed complained about the exact same thing especially right after tragedy occurred.

                  Police scanner and Fire Department is disqualified for me. There was also a "drill" happening around that time. I would also expect scanner traffic and fire department chatter if it was a hoax or not. There is always radio chatter during these events real or not.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  As for the videos I have already seen these and it doesn't prove anything to me. This only proves my point. Any intelligence agency can make a video of people begging to use a truck to carry victims.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  I have told you three times what IS MISSING FROM THE EQUATION.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  Where are all the selfies from these 500 people who are injured. We should have them on an ongoing basis every day. We should have hundreds of videos from the people at the concert that show an enormous trauma team caring for hundreds of bloody bodies. We need videos with bloody people screaming in panic and pain that are homegrown videos done by amateurs with cell phones.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  There should be enough of this video to sit and watch for hours on end. We don't have it. Maybe you are willing to believe that the lame little video we do have proves that 500 people got shot. Not me. Not enough.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  You're a smart guy. Not sure what you don't understand about that.

                That is past tense. I'll say it again. Bullet wounds don't go away in a month. Times 500 people. A huge number of those people will be churning out selfies material. vids and pics. Their friends and relatives will be do the selfie thing to some degree. Youtube can't stand on all those. Not to mention they should be getting cranked out daily since the day this happened.

                and on and on and on and and on. How many uploads is that by now? Hundreds. More like thousands probably. Youtube is not standing on all that. Where is it?

              I'm not spamming your posts. Everything related to this situation contains clues somehow. This lady claims to be a witness. I have no idea if she is or not. If she isn't maybe one of us will recognize her as a crisis actor or something.

             The guy defends satanists. That is not normal in a Christian church. Take the time to watch the videos before commenting for heaven's sake.

            That is one spooky church. Granted, everybody's doctrine is twisted nowadays, but this place gives a creepy vibe.

            "For such are false apostles, deceitful workers, transforming themselves into the apostles of Christ.
           </p>
           <p>
            "And no marvel; for Satan himself is transformed into an angel of light. Therefore it is no great thing if his ministers also be transformed as the ministers of righteousness; whose end shall be according to their works."

             Why do you suppose I'm getting trolled so hard, and this has 7 downvotes? I figured people would want to look into the claims about the children, but they're just screaming "NOTHING TO SEE HERE". Voat is so disappointing.

              Yeah Voat can def be disappointing. I figure many are not watching the videos, also the "religious" aspect turns people off. Thing is, you cannot understand "pizzagate," without understanding evil, and where it truly comes from. It is spiritual in origin. Most of these user names I don't recognize, things have changed quite a bit here in the past several months. This is not a "normal" baptist church, they are extremely washed out at best, and evil at worst. Really screwed up teaching going on here.

            I haven't looked at anything contained in this post... I saw the title- And Felt Inclined to say
            <strong>
             "yes- you are correct."
             <strong>
              I can Say with
             </strong>
             100 % certainty
            </strong>
            , You are correct. And I can say that without knowing a single name of the individuals Involved... Victims or otherwise... The verification Isn't in the specifics. IF Anybody else can make that proclamation, Or in the slightest sense, Knows what I'm talking about- PM me.

            It's a long shot... But hey- Why not?

             Then you didn't watch the dang videos. Why are you commenting if that is the case?  It is not normal to preach that Jesus went to hell, nor that satan had Jesus on the ground with his foot on Jesus' chest, truth is the exact opposite.

               Perhaps I misquoted the videos. I am not familiar with the Bible, so have to defer to her. Maybe that's not a claim she made, but my memory messed it up.

                To be fair, the Apostle's Creed isn't Scripture. I just know that guy gave me a weird feeling as he was talking about explosives and box cutters.

                 1 Peter 3:19-20, Ephesians 4:9.  I can't speak for other denominations, but Christ descending into hell after the crucifixion is absolute doctrine taught in Baptist churches in South Texas. If you are going to spaz out and investigate this church over what they preach, you better start investigating every Baptist church in Texas.

                  English standard version doesn't mention hell. But it does say "In saying 'He ascended,' what does it mean but that he had also descended into the lower regions, the earth?"

                  I always believed that his triumph over death through His ressurection implied a sort of 'victory lap' in hell. Like I said. I finished spazzing.

                  No not all. Traditionally, this simply means he died and was buried. He went to Hades, not hell.

                   Sounds great.  Doesn't change anything about Christ going to hell being taught in baptist churches.  Pretending that this one church is preaching something revolutionary and pizza gate related is absolute idiocy, when every baptist church I've been to preaches the same.

                 Precisely. This is not scripture and the lady in the video had a really good point. Plus the demon comment was pretty suspect too. I think it's better to be safe than sorry. Keep digging.

               Respectfully, show me where the apostles creed is in the bible. A'int there. That's some added on garbage that made it into the "MacDonald's marketing" version of Christianity. Not biblical.

                 Your personality politics does not make either of these scriptures the apostles creed. Rather than focus on calling people names, why don't you get to work figuring out why so many people still feel like the church gave them the creeps. Since it's clear you can't discern spiritual things, stick to discerning earthly things. God put intuition in us for a reason. Don't let yours get compromised by empty sabre rattling.

                You are so retarded. Another Church of Dawkins moron who knows nothing about the bible or Christianity. You're fucking wrong and just watching your ignorant and arrogant comments "nope, its not" are infuriating. You're what is wrong with this site and conspiracy theories in general. MORON.

                 You are such a shill, and don't really warrant a response other than you are wasting people's time with these rabid Christianity bashing responses. You obviously don't give a stuff about these kids to waste your research time making responses like this. If this is all you know how to do, take your non-researching self somewhere else. We don't need you.

                  This is what disturbs me. I posted here because I thought this was the one place that would care to look into whether these  children are/were in danger, and all i get is trolled. Thanks for weighing in.

                   I get you. We're still here :) What's curious about this post's responses is that it seems to have offended people's ideas of what a Baptist Church is supposed to be/preach and has exposed it for the apostasy that it has become of late. We were warned of false prophets and a lot of Christians have been asleep at the wheel for a while and this just exposed that too.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   The interesting thing about pizzagate is that it has been exposing and sacrificing "idols" left and right: Hollywood celebrities, political officials, banks, legal systems, preists, pastors, everything that we have taken for granted as being harmless is being discovered to have been quietly weaponised and people don't want to face the truth. Even when it bites them.

                    I truly think they're shills meant to derail anyone questioning these "mass shootings". Really. But I hear what you are saying, and it's so true that we have had the scales torn from our eyes and that does not feel good.

                  Sounds like someone is really insecure about being called out on their lack of knowledge about a given topic. All you have done is cry bitch whine and moan. Nothing of substance offered. You are begging us to just believe you under threat of you crying and throwing accusations. You are not going to hold anyone hostage with your bitch tears.

                   Transference par excellence.  I know you are, but what am I. can we stop wasting time trying to force catholic dogma into scripture problem and return to the trafficking of children problem? Or is sledging all you know how to do?
