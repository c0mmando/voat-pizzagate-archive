<p>Custody of the remains — found at the Perry Funeral Home, on Trumbull just north of Warren Avenue — was turned over to state investigators, who immediately declared the business closed and its license suspended, according to a statement from Michigan Licensing and Regulatory Affairs.</p>
<p>Of the grisly total, there were 36 fetuses stored in boxes and another 27 found in freezers, police said. Friday’s discovery of the decomposed remains followed a similar grisly finding last week at the defunct Cantrell Funeral Home on Detroit’s east side, where 11 infants’ remains were found after an anonymous letter arrived in the offices of state regulators in Lansing.</p>

<p>Friday\'s raid at the Perry home came after Detroit homicide detectives also raided QA Cantrell Funeral Home in Eastpointe to investigate a potential connection with the fetuses found in the ceiling of Cantrell Funeral Home in Detroit. Detectives seized computers, business cellphones, and paperwork, according to a news release. They also raided the home of the owner, Anetta Cantrell, the widow of the deceased founder of the Detroit home with the same name.</p>
<p>Detroit Police Chief James Craig said he was stunned.</p>
<p>&quot;I’ve never seen anything (like this) in my 41 and a half years” as a police officer, Craig said, at a news conference on Friday, adding: “It’s disturbing, but we will get to the bottom of this.” </p>
<p>Craig said police were tipped off to violations at the Perry Funeral Home by a father involved in a civil suit over the improper burial of his infant daughter.</p>
<p>Lawyers for the father as well as the mother of the deceased baby said the parents are plaintiffs in a lawsuit that they hope will allow them to represent dozens, perhaps scores, of parents whose infant remains were improperly handled by the Perry Funeral Home. The case could become a class-action lawsuit representing every parent who comes forward with a similar complaint, Troy attorney Peter Parks said.</p>
<p>“We already thought we had a strong case, and then when the news starting hitting the media about Cantrell, our clients agreed that we should take what we knew to the highest level” of the Detroit Police Department, Parks said Friday.</p>',

              I was going to ping you on this.  Thanks for chiming in.  That is exactly what I was wondering if that was possible. So do you think this took place at some hospital and this place was their go to for burials or disposing of them.  The funeral home then never buried them or got backed up.  Could they have done the harvesting at the funeral home?

                For sure they have cooling at funeral homes.  Remember that case, Kenneka Jenkins in Chicago, the missing girl found at a hotel.  She was found in a freezer and many think there was an organ harvesting op set up there.  So who knows.

              Trouble For Crematory Operator
             </p>
             <p>
              The operator of a Georgia crematory where hundreds of bodies were found discarded last month was charged with six felony counts of abuse of a corpse.
Ray Brent Marsh, operator of the Tri-State Crematory in Noble, Ga., charged with 174 counts of theft by deception.
Investigators have recovered 339 bodies since Feb. 15 on the Marsh family's 16 acres behind the crematory. So far, 109 bodies have been identified.
County records show that at least 250 bodies sent to the crematory since 1998 were from Tennessee.
Bradley County Sheriff Dan Gilley said Marsh traveled the 50 miles from Noble to Cleveland to pick up bodies for cremation under contract from Bradley County funeral homes.
Gilley said once Marsh took the bodies back to Georgia he mistreated and disposed of the bodies in violation of Tennessee law, "and in a manner which is offensive to the sensibilities of ordinary people."
Gilley said more charges are expected. He said he will go before the grand jury on Wednesday.
Marsh, 28, took over the crematory business from his father in 1996.
Investigators were tipped that Marsh was disposing of the bodies rather than cremating them, as he was paid to do.
On Friday, Marsh's parents, Ray and Clara Marsh, and sister were arrested, each charged with misrepresenting themselves as licensed funeral directors by signing death certificates in Georgia. They were released on bail.
             </p>
             <p>
              Georgia authorities have said they expect to file more charges against Marsh.
Several lawsuits have already been filed against Marsh and funeral homes in Tennessee, Georgia and Alabama that contracted with him.

             Very good question. Were they selling the dead babies for stem cell research?  Maybe something to do with satan worship, even though from what I understand those types use live sacrifices. Regardless, this has a very creepy, evil, feel to it.
