             Blew My Mind.  Amazing.  The other guy Murphy only served 5 yrs in prison for kidnapping a boy and taking him to NY.  What do people think he did with him when they found him in a hotel with the boy?  RAPE!  So that is all he got for doing all that.  WE MUST DEMAND tougher sentences for these perverts.  I don't care if they are Hollywood.  25 years is what he should have gotten, at least.  Ideally, if it were possible,  Slammer for life, throw away the key.

              Those are the 2 that are the most prolific, the ugliest inside and out, and the most perverse. It's not about sex for either of them. It is about power and degrading both sexes. They film everything that they do and then sell it to everyone in Hollywood and in foreign countries, as a way to finance their projects. Anyone seeing the disgusting pictures and short films will assume it's "open season" on the participants. Sure they'll cover the incidentals of a trip to Cannes or to their home country, as well as the coke and other drugs. That's why so there's such a constant demand for young, fresh meat.

            I appreciate it compliment! I'm glad the subject is being blown up and I could help bring awareness! We all need to! Not only bring down this fat sadistic abusive fuck but every single one of them need to fry or be jailed for life! Soon I will even be using my own popular rising YouTube account to create a video to blast out all these pedophiles I just wanted to grow it first

            I have about 5,000 subscribers but in a few months when it hits 10 to 20 thousand going to create some Pizzagate awareness videos.

             Do you every need  a very experienced actress/comedienne to volunteer for any of the work that you do? I'm willing to work for free and cover my own expenses as I really, really believe in what you're trying to do.

              Maybe I'm not sure how I'm going to do it when I make Pizzagate awareness when I start to do it but I've brainstormed several ways.  These videos need to catch the public's attention. It's almost impossible to reach people like Titas Frost, Honeybee, Victurus Libertas VL etc when I tried to message them about a child sex trafficking ring that's blatant on Youtube who monetize them so they make money from advertisements.  I tried contacting them when people here on Voat suggested and got no answer.
              <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/v/pizzagate/2098047">
               https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/2098047
              </a>
              I created two posts bringing attention to it here on Voat and one on Reddit (
              <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/6x3la4/therea_a_human_traffickers_page_on_youtube_thats/">
               https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/6x3la4/therea_a_human_traffickers_page_on_youtube_thats/)
              </a>
              ) and despite all of them making top of the page got no response from any of them. So if people can't reach out to them they are useless. I want to create an awareness page that I can wake the masses up but most of the Pizzagate pages that specialize on it have almost no views or subscribers. So I started my Youtube page originally for myself because I wanted to post clips from movies I couldn't find on YT for myself to watch, and somehow within two months have 5,000 subscribers and videos about to hit a million views. When the times right Im going to get all the research on here with "teeth" and create a series of Pizzagate videos so to say and redpill the masses so hopefully we can thousands more in the fight against this evil. Only thing I'm trying to figure out is out is how I'm going to do it. I didn't originally start my page as a Pizzagate page, it's one dedicated to apocalyptic stuff like The Walking Dead, The Strain, Battle Los Angeles etc. Do I start posting Pizzagate videos saying this is different then my normal videos and a huge problem facing the world and posting research videos or should I add a bump or commercial at the beginning or end of a video?  Like my War of the Worlds video (885k), (
              <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tx9x02LcimI&amp;t=312s">
               https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tx9x02LcimI&amp;t=312s)
              </a>
              ) my Battle LA video (324k) (
              <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fvQaHK-I3dU&amp;t=13s">
               https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fvQaHK-I3dU&amp;t=13s)
              </a>
              ) CELL (204k) (
              <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6jWYE30fOg&amp;t=23s">
               https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6jWYE30fOg&amp;t=23s)
              </a>
              ) my videos are on fire and I want to somehow get the masses attention on PG and come to Voat with numbers like that. So maybe keep posting videos or see if I can somehow add bumps to previous videos and create some Pizzagate videos as well. That or add the occasional PG video on top of the ones I usually post? I try to be active on Voat so it makes no sense if I didn't use my YT page to help as well. So Ill def let you know if I need volunteer work or researchers to send me research videos but going to get this awareness train pushing somehow. Nothing I hate more then pedophiles. In my opinion they are the real apocalypse smh.

            There's a very real problem I have brought up in other threads. Complaining about a Hollywood predator or pedo means the automatic end of your career and possible death threats, UNLESS the perp is seen as a continual money loser rather than an at least occasional cash register &amp; money maker.
           </p>
           <p>
            Also exactly where does one complain? You'd have to have a big enough top famous name for any of the paps to be interested in publishing a quote. Even then they know it's the end of advertising from the studio where the perp works. No more needed interviews with any of their stars or past stars. See how the game works?
           </p>
           <p>
            Police aren't interested. SAG-AFTRA won't do anything. Lawyers are usually reluctant to take these kind of cases as they know the perps have unlimited $$$$.
