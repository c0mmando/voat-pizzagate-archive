            My guess, someone is using this hot button issue to get a larger part of their whole budget approved.  Definitely every child in court needs a competent caring Lawyer who is on their side vs. an indifferent hostile Judicial bureaucracy.  People will stand up for this issue.
           </p>
           <p>
            Bureaucracies have Rules and make you fill in the Form.  Then you get another.  They make up Forms and keep Forms. That's all they care about in the professional sense.  It's a monopoly so they don't even fake friendliness like at a McDonald's.  No need to and you almost can't get fired.
           </p>
           <p>
            You need a Lawyer at any age if your caught within such a system.   A Lawyer gets respect, being a human being just isn't enough.  This is the poorest pay a Lawyer can aspire too with many opportunities for disappointment and heartache.  A top notch law firm wins most of it's cases, it's less stress and way better pay.  Plus your popular.  Lawyers for the indigent don't get much respect down here on earth.  God Bless YOU.

             I have always had a soft spot in my heart for those that work with children.  I knew a Juvenile Detention Officer years ago and she was a toughie with a soft heart.  She was always there for her family but for the kids too.  I don't know how she did it.  Her husband was a Social Worker with a Heart.  They did not live in the lap of luxury but always had enough to always have a Christmas Party for her piers at their home.  Some of them were really needy.  They were just starting out or had large families.  They gave a gift to each child.  This was not a large group.  Just about 6 people and family.  I will never forget her.  They are gone now but their kindness lives on.  These are not the takers that you and I are talking about.  There are people working for the government helping children that have their hearts in the right place.  We must remember that.  Thank you for setting the record straight on those lawyers.  I have done some activist work and have seen some of the young students going to law school and many of them want so much to make a difference.  Thank You Again.

             Yeah,don't even ask my friend about Emanuel or you will hear a String of 4 Letter Words.   I have had a Personal Hate for him as well since he was with Clinton.  I would not put it past him to orchestrate this whole thing to leave the children unprotected.  We don't want to harm one hair on those Pedo Heads.  The Children Need Someone In Their Corner.

            Took me quite a bit to find the article.  This is my friend's story really.  She called me.  So very sad.  These are not CPS workers.  These are those Attorneys that are Court Appointed.  The ones that represent that Poor Little Child that has been Raped or Abused by a Pedophile Parent or Child Rapist on the Loose.  Shame on Chicago and Tony Preckwinkle and Timothy Evans.
