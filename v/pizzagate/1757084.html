<p>Now to the thread title. There was an interview done with Michael Alig and a friend back in 1988. This video has pizzagate connections due to the terminology used. I am now going from memory but he used either one, some or all of these terms - <strong>chicken</strong>, <strong>chickenhawk</strong> and <strong>buck</strong>. These were used in a conversation where Michael Alig confessed to finding underage boys attractive and preferable. I also believe the age 10 years or under was brought up and Alig denied finding that attractive but seemed to do it in a jokey way so as to distance himself from allegations of paedophilia.</p>
<p>As I said I couldn\'t remember what the exact references were so I went back to Youtube to look the interview up. I found these two links. Both of which have serious sound problems.</p>

            He's recently been in a movie. Alig is a hero to the younger club "kids" The older ones shun him.

            Here's another one that uses the chickenhawk clip. I would email this guy through YT and ask for the original. There are dozens of PG vids now that use the Alig clip. In looking for this vid I searched "alig pizzagate" and they all turn up.
