These were used in a conversation where Michael Alig confessed to finding underage boys attractive and preferable.

            He's recently been in a movie. Alig is a hero to the younger club "kids" The older ones shun him.

            Here's another one that uses the chickenhawk clip. I would email this guy through YT and ask for the original. There are dozens of PG vids now that use the Alig clip. In looking for this vid I searched "alig pizzagate" and they all turn up.
