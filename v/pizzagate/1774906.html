            If the multi-layer facades of its evasive executives seem dodgy, well, then look at the registry of SocialMediaDaily domain, which is owned by WhoisGuard. Its office address is P.O. Box 08123-03411, Republic of Panama, and the registrant is Juan Carlos Mata, a partner in the Mata and Pitti offshore legal services firm. The search though the false fronts of WhoisGuard eventually leads to eNom, located at
            <strong>
             Lake Washington Boulevard in Kirkland, Washington State.
            </strong>
           </p>
           <p>
            <strong>
             Kirkland, on the Bellevue crescent of Seattle
            </strong>
            , was where David Mikkelson got the early income for
            <strong>
             Snopes.com
            </strong>
            in the late 1990s with funding from local software developer
            <strong>
             Zango
            </strong>
            , which
            <strong>
             secretly installed a tracking system into
             <strong>
              Snopes.com
             </strong>
             user’s computers.
            </strong>
            That illegal practice was successfully challenged in court by McAfee and Kasperky security. Despite the fines against
            <strong>
             Zango
            </strong>
            , Mikkelson continued to spread the spy software to Snopes.com visitors over the following two years. Zango’s software deveopment, as we discovered, was linked to Tel Aviv tech companies that emerged from the Israeli Defense Force cyber-warfare command.
           </p>
           <p>
            <strong>
             Kirkland-based eNom controls an estimated 15 million domain names worldwide
            </strong>
            , a staggering number for a flimflam company. This allocation could be possible only with an inside track at ICANN, the registrar dominated by the U.S. National Science Foundation.
           </p>
           <p>
            The eNom servers in Asia, Europe and the USA are identified as akam.net, indicating a contract with Akamai, which is affiliated with the NSA, according to Cryptome. The Akamai server farm in Cambridge, Massachusetts, also hosts CIA.net.
           </p>
           <p>
            No wonder President Barack Obama hurriedly transferred the ICANN registry to the United Nations, where the Western intelligence agencies can continue to control child porn and drug sales on the Internet, free of any danger of detection by Team Trump. Should we be surprised to see a CIA front linked with contraband? Since the Air America heroin years and Mena Airfield cocaine trade in Clinton’s Arkansas, the CIA has been associated with drug trafficking, child sex and money laundering, and add to that treason. So what else is new?
           </p>
           <p>
            The latest CEO of eNom is a multimillionaire India-born Canadian citizen Taryn Naidu, who has since launched a publicly listed company called Rightside to manage the millions of domain names, adding yet another layer of legal evasion plus legal protection with corporate status. Which leads to eNom-Rightside’s substantial income from online** sales of “Canadian meds” through the 15,000-20,000 websites that advertise these counterfeit drugs. Many of these are eXXXtreme porn sites featuring child sex, violent rape and bestiality.**
           </p>
           <p>
            Top sellers include fake Viagra and Cialis (pronounced CIA-lust). The supply of counterfeit drugs are sourced overseas from Israel and Latin America, although most of the supply comes from generic pharmaceutical companies in India. The Indian-Canadian CEO of eNom/Rightside, Naidu earlier ran websites in the Caribbean region in Turks and Caicos, which is a major transshipment point for cocaine flows between Colombia and Florida. Are we starting to understand why the Clintons and Obama want most-favored nation trade status for India and Colombia?
           </p>
           <p>
            What does this lucrative business have to do with Satanism? Because the unsafe pharms from “Canada” aka India-Israel-Colombia are often taken in tandem with methamphetamine and ketamine.
            <strong>
             That combo of sex enhancers and psycho drugs trigger uncontrollable violent urges during sexual activity, resulting in strangulation, beheading and dismemberment
            </strong>
            . The Devil couldn’t be any happier.
           </p>
           <p>
            Other agencies of the U.S. government are not playing long with the spy games. The U.S. Treasury Department has put eNom on its blacklist for abetting international cyber-crimes of sheltering money launderers, drug dealers and prostitution rings. In March 2013, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) launched a cyber-crimes investigation unit to shut down websites fronting for the counterfeit-drug industry. Just by coincidence in that very same time-frame as the regulators’ crackdown, Snopes.com started to experience the financial shortfalls that led to the Mikkelson divorce.

             As I recall, Murray was initially reluctant to run for Mayor.  He was a congressman as I recall and generally well-liked, and the consensus was the previous Mayor needed to be replaced, but there wasn't a really strong person running.  Murray was basically drafted for the role and did not jump into it enthusiastically - I'm guessing this has something to do with it.

            So we got the Seattle times doing a cover up for a prominent politician when he is first accused in Washington by 2 men for child molestation. But now they are willing to do the right thing when a third one shows up. I have to wonder which press agency asked the embarrassing question in that news conference and whether the Times would be reporting this had it not gotten so public? I searched for a video of the conference and came up empty handed.

            I have personally heard credible stories from the 1990's about sex parties with high-ranking corporate/government people in Seattle.  They'd hire young gay men and bring them up to the high floors of downtown buildings for their events and use them as party favors.  People know about this stuff.

               Yes, but I am seeing that there are laws popping up slowly.  Never fast enough, by all means.  We are impatient when the crimes are so heinous, and rightly so.

            God, don't you love when pedos get all huffy when a victim stands up to them? Why am I not surprised by this? Wasn't Seattle where that disturbing photo of the very young girl with the man completely covered in black and with his hand around her neck? And no Seattle cop stops them and asks WTH is going on? If this allegation and the mayor is guilty may he rot in jail and be the official greeter when HRC &amp; Co join him.
