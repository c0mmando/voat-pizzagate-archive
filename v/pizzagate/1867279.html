            Why is it highly probable?

           <p>
            There's pretty much no doubt the DNC was hacked by an outsider.
           </p>
           <p>
            CrowdStrike is just one of the foresnic security companies that indicated this.     Several of their competitors agreed with their findings including
           </p>
           <p>
            ThreatConnect 
 Mandiant
Fidelis
           </p>
           <p>
            All of the intelligence Agencies agree on this.
           </p>
           <p>
            Was Seth Rich using a Russian language version of MS Office?
           </p>
           <p>
            Did Seth Rich also steal info the many other US institutions that were hacked during this campaign?
           </p>
           <p>
            Podesta?  One of hundreds who were targeted for spearfishing?
           </p>
           <p>
            The RNC?  They were hacked but the files never leaked.
           </p>
           <p>
            There were 20 attemptedhacks of state Election offices.  They were successful in AZ, IL and two other states.
           </p>
           <p>
            The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee was hacked.
           </p>
           <p>
            You think Seth Rich was running around doing all of this?   And he's able to fool the top forensic security companies because he's a super ninja hacker with cheat codes?

            Wonderland should be an easy investigation, most bars and restaurants have cameras, did Seth use his credit card, ask Wonderland to look at the credit card receipts from that night and see who cashed out at closing and contact those people and show them a picture of Seth and see if anyone recognized him. Where did the killers go after the shooting? Are their not traffic cameras all over D.C.? What cars were on the road in the area from 4:20 -4:50am? Why did Seth call his dad at 1:30am and what did they talk about? What did he talk about with his girlfriend for an hour and a half? They could both shed light on just how drunk he was. Ask the bar to release the receipts from that night to find out how much alcohol Seth drank that night. Theirs got to be a friend that has walked home from the bar with him before, what route did they take home? Sorry D.C. Police but you should be fired fro. The case for incompetence

             Absolutely. This cover up non-investigation shit is wicked. So, how could the parents be so low in curiosity? Shouldn't they explore every avenue?! Can you be that trustworthy of "official" accounts?

            The D.C. Police have had 10 months to solve this case, it's time for them to release their evidence to the public in hopes of finding new clues and leads to find Seth Rich's killers. Politics aside, someone being shot in the back twice and murdered is bullshit and no one should die that way and whoever this cold blooded killer is should be found and sentenced to death. You have to make an example that in America if you shoot and kill someone for no apparent reason then your going to death row

            Do not get thrown off by every news article. Wheeler is correct &amp; it has been confirmed by federal investigator. The DNC hired PR man to handle family statements. Seth sent over 44,000 emails &amp; gigabytes to Wikileaks.
           </p>
           <p>
            The bar owner Joe Capone was inside the whitehouse four days earlier with another notorious political fixer Bob Creamer who was caught on camera this summer.
           </p>
           <p>
            Several resident doctors have leaked info. Be patient keep digging.
           </p>
           <p>
            Those servers would have been seized by the FBI if there was an actual Russian or foreign government hacking. This would be a national security threat. They must seize it and if they did not it can in no way be deemed credible.
           </p>
           <p>
            The DNC had a private organization who was founded by Ukrainian &amp; others examine the server and put out the report. Ludicrous. The FBI knows it, the CIA, &amp; the NSA know it. Seth was unmasked interrogated then died.

                It was reported the DNC server was "hacked", so the FBI twice asked to inspect the server to figure out what happened. Twice the DNC said no and insisted that this whole world changing narrative that Russia is involved in hacking the DNC be based on the findings of a for-profit business they hired. That doesn't seem problematic to you?

                 No.   You can validate the data without having the server.     Also doesn't the conspiracy require the FBI and Intel agencies to be working with the DNC?

                  Comey was/is connected to Team Clinton and has been for a long time. I don't trust him, but now maybe another head can give it a shot. Have them check the server. Why do it another way and why did the DNC say no?

                   Perhaps they said no, because many people in the FBI are close the Trump team, particularly the NY office.  Trump employs ex-FBI agents as security.  Kallstrom and Giuliani have tons of connections to the FBI.   In fact, these connections are being looked into.

             You are so right.  I believe that Capone and Creamer have been complicit in some of their other plans as well.  We should keep checking on the insiders for they always keep using people in their circle.  Those are the ones they have the goods on.  I also believe that is where Seth was during that missing timeline.  DNC or CIA interrogation.  Then came the GSWs.

              Has anyone reached out to the other possibility of his having gone to Wonderland, that stayed open later?
The timeline seems to still be in question and there is now the possible LARPers "that work at the hospital" stating that "8 hours after his arrival the place was swarming with LEO's". Wasn't he pronounced dead just a couple hours after arriving?

               Watch out.  I know this sounds crazy, but I saw something on here yesterday that implied Seth was gay.  I don't know if it was a member in the comments or in an article. I know I saw it and thought, OK they are going to push a new theory to try to discredit him (as if that would correct anything they did).  Just to let you know, I don't believe it for one second. Wonderland Ballroom is suppose to be decorated in a Alice in Wonderland theme.  I could be wrong but crazier things have happened . I have seen that Seth might have let Capone on to some suspicions and that is when Capone called the right people to let them know they had better interrogate him. Someone could have picked him up in a car on his way home.

                Did someone make that "connection" only because of Wonderland, and is that some kind of alternative lifestyle bar? I know there are Alice themed pedo fucks with their day, but are we to suspect anyone/anything Alice related? There is a heavy drug theme attached to that story as well(go ask Alice). I can see a shitty bar reaching for that kind of theme.

                 I am looking right now at pictures on their site and there is a group of kids playing in a band that look pretty young  definitely imo under 18.  Remember that the only reason we thought he was going there was because of what Capone said.  That Seth did not take his offer for a ride home because he was going to another place, the Wonderland Ballroom.  Also I know from something that

                 first clued me in on was that there was a worldwide CP bust called Operatiion Catheral.  The connection here in the US was in St. Charles Mo.  called the Wonderland Club.  This club looks sketchy to me.  Why did Capone mention it?  I could be wrong, but this did not look like a place Seth would have hung out at.  Just Sayin'.

                  Hmmm, having bar-hopped myself, traveling from one place that is closing to another to continue the party is quite common. Was the "drunker than usual" Seth comment from leaving the first bar or from Wonderland? Video from the second spot is crucial, btw.

                   I have read that the police went to Wonderland and no one had seen him or remembered seeing him.  Now does that mean he was not there? We just need more proof since the DC police have not been too forthcoming.  I am of the opinion that he was picked up and interrogated, and walked home.  Because of what he said during the interrogation they felt they must take him down. I believe the plan was already hatched they just wanted to hear what he had to say. Then the GSWs.

                     Wonderland Ballroom came from Joe Capone.  He offered Seth a ride home and Seth said No, he was going to another place and that was Wonderland Ballroom.  So we only have Capone's word on this. There is researching to be done here, for people at Wonderland said they did not see him but Capone said this is what Seth told him.  Hmm.

                       Yes, well now that we know Capone was in on this somehow, imo he made a call as soon as Seth left and then an unmarked dark car picked him up and they said they just wanted to ask him a few questions.  They knew he already had too much to drink or was drugged with some serum and that he might give valuable info.  Whatever he said, they were probably going to kill him anyway.  JP is a cold and brutal killer.  I believe he has killed.  They want to see if what they knew was really true.  Just for corroboration sake.

                         Yes.  I think they already suspected it or they would not have planned the hit, but I think they wanted proof for their own selves.  But of course they can never reveal any of that since that would ruin their Russian fake news and would link them to his death.  I agree with someone I read today that Assange has the power now to reveal that Seth was the leaker. He is no longer in danger since he is gone.  This also gives closure to the family, although I believe in their heart of hearts they know he was and they will never be allowed to speak unless someone solves this horrendous crime.

            The FBI has made three requests to inspect the servers. The DNC continues​ to decline. As it's a request only. They need evidence to so order them. But you see they have no evidence of Russian hacking therefore can only request to look at the servers as the DNC continues to say it was the Russians who hacked them. It's time for Julian Assange to be clear. Seth is now gone and is no longer a source that needs protection. I believe if Julian shows the proof those servers will be confiscated. Well that is how it is supposed to work....
