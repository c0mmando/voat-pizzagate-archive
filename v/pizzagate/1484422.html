<p>Here is one of the <a href="http://orderformforrentapizza.jimdo.com/">very weird websites</a> that JimDo is hosting. Either it\'s an unfortunate prank or it\'s just another hint leading to some sick shit. This page links to a blog which contains <a href="http://rent-a-pizza.weebly.com/blog/january-29th-2015">a post</a> talking about how they rent out pizza in Virginia. It also contains a strange link to the page <a href="http://thecheesehistory.weebly.com/">Cheese History</a>. The <a href="http://orderformforrentapizza.jimdo.com/coupons/contact-us/">Contact Page</a> is pretty bizarre and has a hidden link leading to <a href="https://rentpizza.wordpress.com/2015/12/01/talk-about-everything/">password protected content</a>.</p>

<p>Searching for Smenzly inc. brings you to a <a href="http://www.shmenzly.com/">website which has been taken down</a>. Looking at the cached versions it seems like a broken website apart from a rather strange message at <a href="http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:La9PEC-ipzgJ:www.shmenzly.com/about.html">the bottom of this page</a>. Searching further brings you to one user sporting the rather unique nickname under an <a href="https://www.instagram.com/shmenzimring_101/">instagram page</a> with the user name &quot;shmenzimring_101&quot;. This account is private but sports some sort of codeword <em>KEREM \'19 SSDS \'17</em> and links to a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCBSo-ZNSVRY51HrBiKDCiqg">youtube account</a> by the name of EZanimation with no content. The account has no content but has 21 subscribers and also dates from 2015, the about page confirms it\'s owned by Elie Shmenzly. The about page also links to three pages: a facebook page that has been taken down, a protected twitter page and an <a href="https://www.instagram.com/ez_animation/">instagram page</a> that was let open. This looks pretty innocent until ...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now here comes the kicker. Take a look at his <a href="https://www.instagram.com/ez_animation/followers/">followers</a>. Notice the account named <a href="https://www.instagram.com/jacobpepstein/"><strong>Jacob Epstein</strong></a>, which also happens to contain &quot;SSDS \'17&quot;. <a href="https://www.instagram.com/mzimring/">mzim<strong>ring</strong></a>, another private account containing &quot;ring&quot; and has a pizza as the display picture. <a href="https://www.instagram.com/seeeegs_savitt_17/">Sex Savitt 17</a>, also mentions &quot;SSDS \'17&quot;. SSDS seems to be a reference towards a day school for young jewish children. Among the followers are also two leaders of jewish summer camps for children <a href="http://campyavneh.org/">Yavneh</a> and <a href="http://www.campmicah.com">Micah</a>. Coincidentally an anon found <a href="https://i.sli.mg/LcarSY.png">a link</a> to jewish summer camps three weeks earlier where an alleged victim spoke out against a person named David associated with three of such camps. This may be a vector explaining how these people come into contact with vulnerable children.</p>',

            That looks like a shill site - did you see the trolling on the linked site mocking being taken over by the Illuminati?  The whole thing looks thrown together in an afternoon to me.

            The featured channels contained in the youtube page are...questionable? Do youtube channels control what videos become "featured" on their youtube accounts? If so, of the few featured channels, one is "action movie kid"
            <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/theActionMovieKid">
             https://www.youtube.com/user/theActionMovieKid
            </a>
            which is a youtube channel that focuses on toddlers. Again, do youtube channel owners control the "featured" content?

             Good stuff, of course action movie kid is pretty famous, so besides the fact it's a child it seems intelligent, however the other stuff you found seems very relevant and unexplainable. What secrets could a pickle place have were it a legit pickle place? Their recipe? Pretty much not even that.

            We have a lead of Samuel.

             . Apparently he has been head of school of a day care and two elementary schools, of which one completely changed it's name. Also notice in one of the quotes you can read the following:

            <blockquote>
             <p>
              In his free time, Bil enjoys indulging his love of great pizza.

            Ok so I copied some links to weird javascripts in the webpage
            <a href="http://thecheesehistory.weebly.com/">
             http://thecheesehistory.weebly.com/
            </a>
            and I found a link (removed "hidden" from the description as I don't want to sound hyperbolic) to this
            <a href="http://www.picklesforever.com/">
             http://www.picklesforever.com/
            </a>
            in the ABOUT US section of the CHEESE webpage. I'm scared to look. This is where it says the Pickle League operates
            <a href="http://www.picklesforever.com/#planet">
             http://www.picklesforever.com/#planet
            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            The drawing of where the pickle league operates says it's by Ben Diaz. . Pickle's, some fictional chlidren's book linked throughout the webpage, is told in the first person by the 6th grader Ben Diaz
           </p>
           <p>
            There are so many other weird things on this webpage. Check them out.
           </p>
           <p>
            Addition: So after looking at the Pickle League's blog, I found this:
            <a href="http://www.picklesforever.com/#blog/home">
             http://www.picklesforever.com/#blog/home
            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            ATTENTION, PICKLE LOVERS:
To meet the guidelines for club funding, we are "contributing to the conversation on the dynamics of pickling." You can guess who said that. So here is all of the pickling information that we can find in our sporadic searches. Frank has an alert set up for wacky pickle recipes, because he's cool like that. Have something you think we should share? Send it to Bean at catvsdude at gmail dot com and hopefully we can post it. -the League of Pickle Makers
           </p>
           <p>
            So this club receives funding to appear like a legitimate operation?

             Here's a form from the LA state library with a description of the their pickle themed kid's book as well as questions. Most of the kids books and videos that I've seen connected to this (like How I Saved The President: AKA the undercover kid) have a set of discussion questions attached to them. Usually these questions have to do with how sometimes something bad is good (lesser evil logic) or about the importance of keeping a secret, which to me sure look like grooming aides: 
DISCUSSION QUESTIONS
1.
Ben assumes things about Hector based on what Hector has done in the past, and 
is proven wrong. When have you assumed something about someone and been 
wrong?
2.
Why is the League so careful to keep both adults and other students from finding out any of their secrets?
3.
One of the themes of the book is trust. Who do you trust? Why? What would make you stop trusting that person the way Ben stops trusting Hector?
4.
Is it fair for Principle Lebonsky to punish the whole school for the actions of one person? What about after the P.T.A comes clean?
5.It can be fun to play pranks on other people, but it can be scary or upsetting to 
have pranks played on you. 
Playing pranks maliciously can also be bullying, 
which you never want to do. Ben and the others are careful to only play pranks 
that will let other people play along. What are some other ideas for pranks and tricks that will let everyone have fun?
6.
Why did Hector tell his grandmother that he and Ben were responsible for the 
graffiti outside their apartment?

             Also, on the pickle site there's a US map of pickle chapters and a globe map involving Honduras that didn't make sense to me.
