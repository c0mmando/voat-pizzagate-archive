             This is thoroughly debunked.
            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            Regarding your linked article.
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             James Alefantis is closely tied with members of the Maccoby family, whom are involved with an international orphanage network called NPH
            </p>
            <p>
             Child-trafficker Laura Silsby was given children from Friends of the Orphans, an orphanage branch of NPH
            </p>
           </blockquote>
           <p>
            The first part is true.   The second part is false and it's false it two ways.
* Friends of the Orphans is not an orphanage branch of NPH.  It's the Other way around NPH runs orphanages.  Friends of the Orphans does not.  Friends of the Orphans is an American charity whose sole mission is raise funds.  These funds are donated to NPH, but Friends of the Orphans does not spend the money on housing, clothing, feeding orphanages.
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             Bill Clinton, the man who intervened in Laura Silsby's case, ..............
            </p>
           </blockquote>
           <p>
            It's highly, highly dubious that Clinton intervened.   The State Department denied this at time and the only evidence at time was a single news report in the UK Times.  That report was never followed up by any other international news outlets, any Haitian news outlets or even the UK Times.  They never developed this story any further.  I go into all the reasons, I believe this single news report to be wrong here.

           <p>
            Bumbleberries mentions this
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             Though she was arrested on her second attempt at the border, she was previously caught attempting to load 40 children onto a bus in Petionville, after a concerned citizen reported suspicious activity to a police officer.
            </p>
           </blockquote>
           <p>
            And this did happen, but here's where Bumbleberries goes wrong.
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             Interestingly, the orphanage that Laura Silsby was given children from in Petionville was the same orphanage as the one which Max Maccoby is a director at, and is also part of the same orphanage network which Michael Maccoby coaches leaders for.
            </p>
           </blockquote>
           <p>
            She's claiming the orphanage in Petitionville in the NPH orphanage.  It is not.  NPH has an orphanage in Haiti, but it's not in Petitionville.  It's in a Mountain town in Kensicoff.   The orphanage, St Helene isvery well known and furthermore it did not collapse.  If NPH needed a place to move kids from one of their facilities, they are a completely safe and functioning orphanage that already had staff to take care of the kids.
           </p>
           <p>
            Below is from my post debunking this story.
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             The claim was that Silsby got the children from an NPH orphanage that had collapsed. NPH indeed had a building that collapsed
            </p>
            <p>
             However, it was not the orphanage. It was their offices. The Father Watson Center was the building that Collapsed.
            </p>
            <p>
             Kay Pere Wasson (Father Wasson Center) located in Pétionville, Port Au Prince This five-story building, formerly St. Damien Hospital, is the administrative hub of NPFS
            </p>
           </blockquote>
           <p>
            So what did Silsby do in Petionville?   First you have to understand that Petitionville is both the name of a wealthy surburb in Haiti with gated communities and it's the name
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P%C3%A9tion-Ville">
             of a homeless shantytown just outside Petitionville.
            </a>
            After the earthquake, this Petitionville shantytown became of giant tent city of tens of thousands of people (I think it was on a golf course) and this tent city is where Silsby went.  (This is new info on voat, because my other posts on this were already too long, I had to cut out text to post them.)****

           </p>
           <p>
            Evidence of Silsby visiting Petitionville tent city orphanage and not a collapsed NPH facility.
CNN 2/9/10 said this.   (Note this lawyer was a real Haitian lawyer, not the con man Puello.)
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             The American missionaries in Haiti....made an earlier, unsuccessful attempt at taking dozens of other children, a Haitian police officer said......
The officer said he discovered Silsby and the nine other Americans on a bus in Port-au-Prince's Pétionville neighborhood after receiving a tip from a concerned citizen. He stopped the group and ordered the children to get off the bus. He then directed Silsby to the Dominican Embassy. ....A former attorney for the group, Edwin Coq, said the officer has testified of his account.
Prosecutors questioned the officer last week in the case against the missionaries. Prosecutors no longer suspect him of any wrongdoing, and he is now a witness, according Coq, who is familiar with the prosecution's case file.

            <a href="http://www.bpnews.net/32953/exclusive-radically-different-story-emerges-about-baptists-detained-in-haiti">
             The Baptist Press interviewed the Pastor
            </a>
            who was arrested with Silsby and his story dovetails with this CNN story in several ways said after their first choice turned them down they went to a tent city orphanage, but a Haitian police officer stopped them and told them they need paperwork from the Dominican Republic.
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             Before entering Haiti the group had made contact with a handful of orphanages, being told by the orphanage directors that they were overcrowded and had quake orphans who could be moved to the Dominican Republican. But the first orphanage the group went to that day -- despite being crowded and having children who were needing food -- "completely changed" its story when Thompson and the others showed up. The orphanage was receiving food and water from outside agencies based on head count and didn't want to lose any residents, Thompson said.
            </p>
           </blockquote>
           <p>
            The Baptists did receive cooperation late that day
            <strong>
             at another tent city orphanage,
            </strong>
            which gave the group approximately six children to take to the Dominican Republic orphanage. The children were placed on the bus but taken off **when a Haitian policeman named Leonard **-- who Thompson said became a "very helpful ally" -- told the group the orphanage was not a "recognized" orphanage. He also told the group that
            <strong>
             they needed written permission from an orphanage director in order to cross the border with the children and take them to the Dominican Republican orphanage,
            </strong>
            New Life Children's Refuge.
           </p>
           <p>
            "And so we took these kids off our bus, gave them back into the care of the tent-city orphanage," Thompson said. "... We cooperated with every government agency and personnel that we talked to."
           </p>
           <p>
            The policeman was "the first to tell us that all that is necessary for us is to have written documentation from an orphanage director transferring the custody of the children from his orphanage to New Life Children's Refuge," Thompson said.
           </p>
           <p>
            This visit to a tent city orphanage is expanded upon in Aftershock: A Journey of Faith to Haiti by M. A. Coulter written by the father of Silsby's assistant Charisa Coulter.  On page 54, they learn of a tent city orphange, get children, were stopped by a sympathetic cop named Leonard and told to get the proper paperwork.   The book also mentions that Leonard testified before the investigating judge and that the judge recognized a legitimate misunderstanding.   This might be why a second set of charges never happened.
The book identifies this tent city as being the El Citron slum not Petitionvile.  I would bet it's the same tent city orphanage, but someone has the neighborhood wrong.  NPH does not have facilities in El Citron either.
           </p>
           <p>
            So if Silsby didn't got to an NPH orphanage on her second attempt and we know she did not, we know exactly where those kids come from and we know on her first attempt she got her kids from a tent city orphanage not the NPH orphanage in Kensicoff, where does this claim that an NPH orphanage come from?
           </p>
           <p>
            It comes from a TV interview with the fake-lawyer, con-man, and convicted child trafficker Jorge Puello, a known liar.   And he doesn't refer to an NPH orphanage or use the French version of NPH, he refers to it as Friends of the Orphans.  FOH is an american fundraising organization.  It runs zero orphanges.

            But all these criminals are just puppets. They have handlers and enablers. I wrote a book about them. How the Cabal is behind every major crime, all connections, names, patterns and tactics. "THE RING" is a total exposure. go on ellacruz dot org and click on "THE RING". download it on Amazon, its free. Spread the word.

              What shit pray tell? You don't even have a HYPOTHETICAL answer to that question because you're just talking shit like a little whiny cunt.  But you're pretty sure it's something, right?  Gonna follow your logic like a man and pursue whatever lead I was burying?  No?  Just gonna jack off and go to sleep right?

             remedy4reality thinks a bomb hit that building because no orphans were killed.
            </p>
            <p>
             Unfortunately, in actual reality that was not an orphanage.  It was an office building.  The NPH orphanage is a 30 minute drive from this location and was not damaged by the earthquake

            <p>
             There's plenty of evidence of earthquake damage in Petionville.

             </p>
             <p>
              A hospital collapsed near the epicentre, and cries of people within the structure were reported by witnesses.
