            into a total joke. Look, Alex can walk away from and lie about pizzagate and what we've uncovered regarding Comet and all the rest, but he can't simultaneously enjoy respect from pizzagaters. It's one or the other. Since he has decided to cover pedogate instead, please submit Alex Jones related stuff to

             Look, man, I've seen you around a lot. You've made a lot of good points, contributed a ton here, and I think you should be respected by the community.
            </p>
            <p>
             With that being said, and I wouldn't say this without saying the aforementioned,
             <em>
              we can't divide people on our own side.
             </em>
            </p>
            <p>
             I get it, AJ dismissed a lot of the work people here put in, and we should be frustrated that he'd seemingly been with us up until the whole CPP apology show. I understand that frustration, and people here are entitled to it.
            </p>
            <p>
             What we can't do, however, is compartmentalize people who are apart of this movement.
            </p>
            <p>
             Frankly, I know saying something like this to another typical member of the community would get blown off pretty easily. I'm hoping though, that people would respect the both of us enough (or at least you) to head this warning:

              I do want to divide disinfo agents from this investigation. I've always seen Alex as one, and he continually proves me right. With regard to pizzagate, he should not be listened to. He has already proven that with his false claims about James Alefantis.

               Alex Jones is an entertainer in many if not most respects. He made bank on PG when he cried out in tears for the babies that he implied or (even may have said) Hillary was sacrificing in the basement of CPP. So while he gave the topic of the Podesta hacked emails exposure, he also created a narrative the MSM could effortlessly use to dismiss the whole thing without scaring the sheeple.

               I'm not sure that argument can carry much weight, though. Think about how Trump got elected: it was because of his eccentric and abrasive personality that he developed such a following. The parallel between the two arises when we examine the ways in which they got to where they are currently: both utilized a very impressionable marketing style which helped them not only develop the following, but attain their position (Trump is president, AJ is
               <em>
                king of alt media
               </em>
               /s).
              </p>
              <p>
               Don't use his eccentric act to take away from his argument - you and people like you took the bait the MSM certainly set up. It seems he realized that, maybe he realized it too late, maybe not, but he realized that.
              </p>
              <p>
               Now, I'm not saying that the CPP leads hold no water, as that is
               <strong>
                damn far
               </strong>
               from the truth. I've
               <em>
                definitely
               </em>
               looked at a lot of stuff associated with JA and other entities around him, and firmly believe he is far beyond just suspicious. With that being said however, you don't fumble around taking out all the pawns if the queen's exposed. You catch my drift?

               At a certain point, they'll look at the people more focused on CPP, mesh that together with #pizzagate, then they'll look at people like AJ, Cernovich, RDS, etc. and they'll associate them with #pedogate. At this point, they'll look on at you and those like you thinking that because you've associated yourself with pizzagate, you aren't relevant in the pedogate case, even despite your affiliation with the process and investigation as a whole. You have to understand that the compartmentalization is where you fall off. When I say we can't let them divide us (no I'm not shia), we can't say things like, "this one person, despite whatever contributions they made to the investigation as a whole, is now a jackass because of X semantics bullshit reason." That' won't fly; it can't fly. We can't nitpick at big contributors. They can't always be right about everything all the time, and for any one of us to ever have thought AJ or anyone like him walks on water would be quite a disgrace.

               I get why you're saying this, but the language you're using is alarming me, and I hate sitting by watching people fall prey to such petty and devious tricks.

               Oh, and as for the comment you linked to, I completely agree and think that's a very valid point. However, I don't think that harms my argument in any fashion.

                Yeah, we're not on the same page at all. I appreciate your time, but I don't  have the energy for his conversation. I have always seen Alex Jones as a snake and very dangerous, and am very disheartened that he's trying to control our conversation around pizzagate ( on behalf of James A, I might add ).

            I would like to iterate that Alex Jonestein is paid by comedy central, just like Stephen Colbertchild. He answers directly to TPTB.

           <h2>
            9/11 makes it obvious:
           </h2>
           <p>
            It is likely that only first responders, and the 250,000 thousands people who got cancer from the nukes as a result, died, as it was necessary to get our intelligence agencies on board. The low nominal American death count was acceptable to the Israeli's.
           </p>
           <p>
            The goals of 9/11 were to
           </p>
           <ul>
            <li>
             cover up the missing Pentagon dollars
            </li>
            <li>
             pit the population with the most guns and largest military on Earth, against Islam (simple unambiguous religion that poses threat to the usury-slave society)
            </li>
            <li>
             create mass surveillance on the populations of the globe in the name of "safety" from an enemy
            </li>
            <li>
             spark wars in order to create that "enemy"
            </li>
            <li>
             secure global opium trade, and increase production 10,000 fold
            </li>
            <li>
             carry out symbolic Freemasonic ritual commencing the rebirth of ISIS
            </li>
            <li>
             spark large waves of immigration to dilute the white populations of Europe and even America. These people were driven out of their homes, into Europe, by sheer terror:
            </li>

            This is a joint operation by all Jewish controlled states. People like Alex Jonestein are responsible for keeping the Westerner distracted with "muh (pretend) terrorism" while the Jew destroys his home.

             Just because Alex Jones may not agree with your interpretation of 9/11 doesn't mean he's paid by Comedy Central. Hyperbole much?

             I don't like AJ either, but long posts about 9/11 theory don't exactly cement that argument.

            Ahhh the blow up that the media will use to discredit the
Movement.  You can set your watch to this guy.
He gets his name all over something. The media puts him at the tip of the spear. Then once he gets that focus on him he has a meltdown that the media can use to smear.
           </p>
           <p>
            Not saying he isn't right. I think we all want to curse and scream at these pedo traitors.  But people have been socially conditioned against righteous fiery male anger. These globalist sit there with that pasted on fake Bill Gates/ Clinton smile. Meanwhile they are causing suffering on a scale not known in recorded history.  Every time there's a huge issue in conspiracy land, MSM pokes and prods AJ waiting for him to act like any normal mammal whose trying to defend himself family and territory.  Testosterone levels in this country are so damn low, anyone who has an IV of SUPER MALE VITALITY  like AJ ends up scaring the super cucks running this country.
           </p>
           <p>
            There's a great story about a group of WWII vets who took to arms to remove the towns corrupt leadership.  Our grandparents generation would not sit back for 5 months and slow a bunch of satanists to kill and torture kids.  We are going on the 6th month of this bullishit. 10s of thousands of kids have been raped sacrificed and murdered. So yea, we all need a little super male vitality right now.

                Blaming the Jews, or at least getting Voat accounts to do so, also plays into the smear campaign by the MSM. They quote us for their hit pieces. I've been around for a while, and never saw anything about "the Jews" on the sub - NOTHING - until just this past month. Now it's everywhere. No, it isn't organic. This is setting us up to be taken down. Your points are spot on too, wish you were more active around here ;)
