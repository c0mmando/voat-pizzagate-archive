            Every week somebody's got to copy and paste this.
            <br/>
            It's going to make the entire thing lose traction because of name confusion.
Is that what you want?
           </p>
           <p>
            The global community has already got the name in place and it can easily be explained.  It's catchy,  what's your problem.
Stop with this shitty idea about re-branding already.
Child trafficking isn't some  Hollywood brand idea.
Instead,  just add some hashtags after #pizzagate  like  #pedogate  #SaveTheKids  etc   or whatever name you decided, which would be impossible for non-English people  (or even Americans)  to remember,  so it gets shut down and tanked.
           </p>
           <p>
            Whoever thought up the name  pizzagate had a really stupid idea,  but we're globally stuck with it,  so just add your own after  the name.

             It's not copy and paste. I made this thread because I tried to talk about it with a friend yesterday and got rolled eyes in response.

             We need to break out into something that can be discussed publicly and that people in real life can relate to.
            </p>
            <p>
             Pizzagate is catchy on the web, but in real life, it's mocked, ridiculed, and called "fake news."

              I see your point,  and I didn't like the name when I first heard it either.    My instant thought was wondering who was high when they landed on that idea. 
The problem is that the name already has international recognition, which is why I think tagging something else behind it might help. 
The name you suggested was so long that I don't think anybody could remember it.  I don't remember it.  (no offense meant)

            This has been rehashed many times. Most seem to agree that rebranding is NOT a good idea. People are already familiar w/ #PizzaGate.  I, personally, would have preferred a different name....but #PizzaGate seems to have stuck. Should there be a consensus to change the name, I think #PedoGate is pretty straight forward and delivers the serious meaning immediatly. Other possible considerations: #PedoDollars #PedoGov #BringDownTheRing.  Again...probably too late. Also, no offense, but" International Coalition of Child Sex Trafficking Investigators" is waaaaaaaaaaaaay toooooooooooooooooo long.
