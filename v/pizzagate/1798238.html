<p>In a video, Stephens says that he is a case manager at Beech Brook , a children’s behavioral health agency that is based in northeast Ohio.</p>
<p>“For 165 years, Beech Brook has been serving Northeast Ohio’s most vulnerable children. Today, as a leading behavioral health agency, Beech Brook will serve more than 18,000 children and families this year,” the facility’s website says. “Beech Brook touches the lives of children, teens and families through an array of services ranging from prevention, education and early intervention to community-based programming to strengthen and support youth and families.”</p>
<p>In one of his videos, Stephens blamed his workplace for driving him to kill people.</p>

            He supposedly shot himself. I just heard an eye witness state that police rammed the back of his car and HE HEARD NO GUN SHOTS. NONE. HE was onsite and it just happened and he heard no gunshots. They cut away after he made that statement.

            This story stinks to high heaven. Many reasons....

            But something also struck me with this pic with Joy Lane.

            Child Lover Beads? 
He also said he has been a Monster and he cannot stand it any more. He blames her. He may also blame his mother.
           </p>
           <p>
            He works with children at a facility that also focuses on child behavior and research projects. Heard that one before?
Wonder what she does for a living? Well I found it:

             " Azusa Street Ministry with the profane and DEMONIC Pazuza."
            </p>
            <p>
             “Scholarly preachers spoke up about these [1906 Azusa] meetings; such as R.A. Torrey who declared that this new Pentecostal movement was ’emphatically not of God, and founded by a Sodomite.’   G. Campbell Morgan called it, ‘the last vomit of SATAN.’ “[34] In 2006, I watched some of the anniversary Azusa Street Ministry on television with a great of curiosity. I noticed that the all of evangelists pounded on the same common theme. They argued that if you weren’t rich, happy and prosperous- it wasn’t anyone’s fault but your own. It wasn’t the police, no New World Order, not even Satan. It was your fault by not giving enough money to God– their ministries as intermediaries between the people and Christ."
            </p>
            <p>
             "The original 1906 Azusa Street Pentecostal Movement had been sponsored by an alleged Homosexual Goat Rider, CHARLES FOX PARHAM, through one of his black disciple lovers, William J. Seymour. But that’s not half the story. The real story behind the street movement is that Parham was a Freemason, and one of the leaders of the West Coast ORDER OF KNIGHTS OF THE KU KLUX KLAN. Parham had been Luciferic Initiated. So, that made the 1906 Azusa Street Pentecostal Movement a Lucifer Project."

             whelp, that clears looking for a truck anytime soon...find him already. He stands out like a sore thumb. If they don't find him I'll have no choice but to believe that he's doing shadow gvt work.

            <p>
             I'm behind on George, why the old guy just about his day? Attention grab? The narrative on him changed twice that I saw already. He's elderly so it already chaps my ass, it could be a kid next. You don't ever wanna go to jail as any kind of sex offender, or have hurt innocent folks. Makes you a target, even his big ol ass. He's not going out without a bullet

            Beech Brook Staff Member was arrested in 2012 for sexual battery.  A 14 yr old girl and 15 yr old girl both said he attacked them in their bedroom.  I tried to copy the link but it did not work.  I think there were a lot of things going on that maybe set this Stevie guy off.  Either way, this could be something to research.  I have not checked yet, but there could be other incidents.

             It seems on the surface they play by the rules, so I'm not entirely sold that it's a den of evil. But there are definitely some red flags about this place.

            After reading your report, I feels it too!  He is a case manager and he has had thoughts of killing people?  When you sense something is really wrong, it usually is.

             “We were shocked and horrified to learn of this news today. We were notified that it was on Facebook, and we are waiting along with everyone else to hear if he has been ABDUCTED. Our hearts go out to the family of Mr. Godwin, and we are hoping that the Cleveland Police will be able to apprehend Mr. Stephens as soon as possible and before anyone else is injured.” - emphasis mine, bit of a freudian slip &gt;.&gt; I also read on a fox website that the school made a comment saying they "knew nothing about it".

             People getting told the school is "closing down" are stupid enough to believe it but are somehow also qualified to work with children who are mentally ill and often wards of the state... yep seems legit.

                Has anybody here heard of Beech Brook? I tried to search but the goat seems broke. Heavy suspicions this dude may have gone awol from something pizzagate/human trafficking related.
