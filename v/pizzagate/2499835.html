            Ok this is how it works. The Sheeple - ™Ok few missiles fired into Syria, that wasn't so bad as I thought, assad had that coming after all, hey nobody's been really hurt here, maybe they were right after all about those nasty chemicals, poor children, see It really wasn't about regime change after all. Let's put the TV on.
           </p>
           <p>
            The NWO -  ™Those Sheeple just fallen for it all over again, they are all so fucking dumb. We can turn them any way we want. They will believe anything we say now. Time for the next part of our plan, a major nerve agent release into a main City should do it. The Sheeple will all be calling out for War with Seria and Russia by the time we have finished with our next false flag. But it must be done soon or Syria could be lost for good. The west must take Syria at any cost, even if it turns Nuclear"

            Future does indeed prove past. This goes for the middle east also. They say it's nothing to do with regime change in Syria, I say it's everything to do with regime change in Syria.
           </p>
           <p>
            Why exactly would the MI6 go to the trouble of using a Russian nerve agent in London, or the white helmets tell lies in Syria if it wasn't for the west looking to take control of Syria.
           </p>
           <p>
            This is only the start of a very clever and cunning plan of the NWO, they know the majority of citizens around the world are against the idea of interference in Syria. They know they can't get what they want with so many people against their present plans, they know they have to get the public on side for war in Syria. You have just witnessed a start to that cause. I give it another few weeks until the next big so say chemical attack takes place in Syria. Or even a false flag event of a nerve agent being used blaming Russians, for what they will say was a retaliation for recent missile launches against Syria.
           </p>
           <p>
            I will repeat the West needs Syria, they will not stop until they have it. They also need the general population on their side before they can move right in and take it. With the next false flag attack they have ready planned, they are hoping to get that green light, to get enough of the general population to say more action is required. We will then be in the middle of World War 3. I hope I'm wrong, watch this space!!

            here's something on Comey's wife
           </p>
           <ol>
            <li>
             Patrice Comey Works With Juveniles &amp; Has Been a Foster Mother
            </li>
           </ol>
           <p>
            Patrice Failor has been a child advocate and she has worked in the criminal justice system in her own way. In March 2016, Patrice Comey testified before the legislative Judiciary Committee in support of a bill that would allow unpaid volunteers to counsel children through the juvenile justice system, said ctpost.
           </p>
           <p>
            The newspaper said that Patrice was accompanied by her husband and an FBI security detail; Patrice Comey is a former Bridgeport Superior Court volunteer. She said:
           </p>
           <p>
            Every foster child in this great state gets a lawyer. These lawyers each has up to 100 cases, but once they have a case they’re to express the best interests of the child in court. And if the lawyer or the judge or anyone feels that what the child wants is in conflict with their best…then he can ask for an advocate for the child separate.
           </p>
           <p>
            Ctpost said the bill would create a program so that judges could appoint special advocates in juvenile court. On Facebook, Patrice Comey, in 2014, wrote: “I am a foster parent, have served as a guardian ad litem for foster kids and work with aging out foster kids in my community.”

                       +1000. Hostel was certainly truth packaged as fiction, but not just about Epstein. This is the sickeningly sinister reason why women and children go missing that nobody wants to talk about, even more so than pedophilia.

                        I don't recommend you watch it if you got the heebeegeebees from Poltergeist.  Scary movie at the time.  And Hostel is even "dated" by today's production standards.  But, it is very true to life.  I wouldn't be surprised at all if many of the scenes were an homage to the the IRL perp.

               That makes me miss my dad. :-(  He had a 73 Dodge Charger with an 8 track the last time I rode in his car. Liked to listen to Johnnie Cash on it.
