<p>ILLUMINATI, Inc. is a privately owned corporation by Founder and CEO <strong>Stephanie Adams</strong>, who was also the Partner and CFO of <strong>Wall Street Chiropractic &amp; Wellness</strong> as well as the Founder and CEO of the 501(c)(3) non-profit global interfaith organization <strong>ILLUMINATIUS</strong>.  ILLUMINATI, Inc. is the parent company of <strong>GODDESSY</strong> and <strong>GODDESSY Organics</strong>.</p>
<p>Her <strong>ILLUMINATIUS</strong> (ILLUMINATI- US) supported global charities expressly include...  <strong>The Lucis Trust.</strong></p>

<p>&quot;<strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucis_Trust">Lucis Trust</a></strong> is the Publishing House which prints and disseminates <strong>UN material</strong>.  Lucis Trust was established in 1922 as <strong>Lucifer</strong> Trust by <strong>Alice Bailey</strong> as the publishing company to disseminate the books of <strong>Bailey and Madame Blavatsky</strong> and the <strong>Theosophical Society</strong>. Due to public outrage over the creepy name of the publishing company, it was changed one year later to <strong>Lucis Trus</strong>t. <strong>It is a devastating indictment of the New Age and Pagan nature of the United nations</strong> (UN).&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;There are elite  ILLUMINATI aristocratic-royal druid/witch covens.&quot; </p>
<p>&quot;Stephanie Adams is so patently ILLUMINATI that she may be just want to be accepted as one the elite aristocratic-royal witch covens that her husband belongs to.  However in her quest, she sold her soul to Lucifer long ago.&quot;</p>
<p>According to her own page she numbers off a huge list of pedigree accolades including the <strong>Knights Templar</strong> - <a href="http://stephanieadams.com/index.html">http://stephanieadams.com/index.html</a></p>
<p>This is just an example: Stephanie Adams: ” … my family tree has other branches that astoundingly stretched even further back into the antiquities, preceding the Old English monarchy to a time of Celtic Rulers, Ancient Druids, and Vikings. My 38th great grandfather, Ragnvald Eysteinsson, Earl of Møre, was a Norse Viking from Vestfold, Norway and was born the year 825.</p>
<p>She was DEEPLY into the <strong>OCCULT</strong>.</p>
<p><a href="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DfBxfn8XUAU1POb.jpg">Templar Cross</a></p>
<p>She was raised in New Jersey by her aunts, <strong>NY models</strong> <strong>Perly Lind (Pearlene Smith)</strong> and <strong>Ruth Joyce McMurrian</strong>. </p>
<p>As a child, Stephanie said that she saw spirits and communicated with them. They sent her messages and signs.</p>
<p>Her aunts were <strong>New York models</strong> and <strong>Druid Occult high priestesses</strong>. Joyce was expressly known as a <strong>“West Pointer“.</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DfBy0zmXUAAcdMr.png">Ruth Joyce McMurrian with Crescent and Star</a></p>
<p>Her <strong>aunts</strong> were the ones to convince her to go into modelling at <strong>16</strong>.</p>
<p>Adams graduated from <strong>Ophelia DeVore School of Charm</strong> that began her career as a <strong>model</strong>, appearing in photo shoots for <strong>Seventeen magazine</strong>, <strong>Venus Swimwear</strong>, and commercial advertisements for <strong>Clairol</strong>. She appeared as <strong>&quot;Miss November 1992&quot;</strong> in Playboy magazine while modeling for <strong>Wilhelmina Models</strong>.  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephanie_Adams">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephanie_Adams</a></p>
<p>She later moved to <strong>Elite Model Management</strong> after becoming engaged to its <strong>CEO, John Casablancas.</strong></p>
<p>&quot;Trump\'s friend <strong>John Casablancas</strong> &quot;was a skilled groomer...&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;The playboys - in particular <strong>John Casablancas</strong> - were used to living by a different set of rules...</p>
<p>&quot;None of these men were shy about their behavior, and the fact that they were bedding models as young as 12 on a routine basis was well known...&quot; -<a href="http://aanirfan.blogspot.com/2016/12/mysterious-ivanka-trump.html">Aangirfan</a></p>
<p>In 1984, <strong>John Casablancas</strong> met <strong>14-year old Stephanie Seymour.</strong></p>
<p>On her 16th birthday, <strong>John Casablancas</strong> arranged a party for <strong>Stephanie Seymour</strong> at a cocaine-fueled nightclub in Milan.</p>
<p>One week later, he moved in with her.</p>

<p>At the age of 13, Ivanka signed on with the new look department of Elite Model Management - under the tutelage of  John Casablancas.</p>
<p><a href="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DfB3tehW0AAjhYx.jpg">Ivanka; 13</a></p>
<p>Stephanie Adams then married <strong>Charles Nicolai into “The House of Nicolay”</strong> (de Nicolay/Nicolai, von Nicolay/Nicolai). It is a European noble family of the <strong>White Greyhound</strong> that dates back to the early 14th Century, with branches primarily in France, England, and Germany, and had a child by him. You can definitely tell she had <strong>OCCULT</strong> designs for the child.</p>
<p><a href="https://mindcontrolblackassassins.files.wordpress.com/2018/05/adamscharlesnicolai.gif?w=300&amp;h=212">White Greyhound</a></p>
<p>In 2013, Stephanie Adams discovered that <strong>Wall Street Chiropractic &amp; Wellness</strong> had been infiltrated by a <strong>Buddha Head Ayurvedic yogaist</strong> out of Istanbul, Turkey, <strong>Dilek Edwards</strong>. One cover story is that her husband, <strong>Charles V. Nicolai</strong>, had her give him Ayurvedic yoga-therapy sessions to alleviate pain from an accident – but told her that <strong>“it had to be a secret.”</strong> Once exposed, Dilek Edwards <strong>had to go</strong>.  It wasn’t about Dilek Edwards being “too cute” to work at Wall Street Chiropractic &amp; Wellness...</p>
<p>When Stephanie Adams, Chief Financial Officer of Wall Street Chiropractic &amp; Wellness discovered her on staff on Oct. 30, 2013, Edwards claims she got a “frantic,” 1:31 a.m. text message from her that said, “You are NOT welcome any longer at Wall Street Chiropractic, DO NOT ever step foot in there again, and stay the F–K away from my husband and family.”</p>
<p>Dilek’s classes fuse rhythmic vinyasa flow, integrated Ashtanga techniques, yoga philosophy, Ayurverdic approach, attentive injury prevention and the value of yoga for healing heart. Dilek is a Yoga Alliance RYT200 from India Chakra Yoga School. Teachers can register as a RYT® 200 if they have successfully completed a 200-hour yoga teacher training that is registered with Yoga Alliance. She also has a RYT500 from Om Yoga Center in New York City. Dilek Edwards studied at Istanbul Bilgi University, Cultural Studies Department, Graduate Student.</p>
<p>Dr. Dhonden was the personal healer to the Dalai Lama, from 1961 to 1980. Born in 1927 in Tibet, he started practicing medicine at the age of 20. In 1959, he began practicing this time-honoured method [Ayureda] in India. Urged by the Dalai Lama to preserve this historic medicine system more profoundly, they established Men-Tsee-Khang, formally known as the Tibetan Medical and Astro Institute at Dharamshala.</p>
<p><a href="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DfB9b3kWsAEiaMh.jpg">CIA Bankrolled Dalai Lama &amp; Keith Raniere of NXIVM</a></p>
<p>Adams’ hostility toward Dilek Edwards had absolutely nothing to do whether or not she was too cute or not. <strong>Edwards was a Buddhist Yoga booty “tantric” prostitute most likely connected to Keith Raniere, Dalai Lama and Nxivm PAN-theistic Buddhism</strong></p>
<p><strong>...it was an attempted infiltration and takeover of Wall Street Chiropractic &amp; Wellness and the customers OF WALL STREET that Dr. Nicholai and Stephanie Adams had already procured and groomed.</strong></p>

           In 2013, Stephanie Adams discovered that
           <strong>
            Wall Street Chiropractic &amp; Wellness
           </strong>
           had been infiltrated by a
           <strong>
            Buddha Head Ayurvedic yogaist
           </strong>
           out of Istanbul, Turkey,
           <strong>
            Dilek Edwards
           </strong>
           . One cover story is that her husband,
           <strong>
            Charles V. Nicolai
           </strong>
           , had her give him Ayurvedic yoga-therapy sessions to alleviate pain from an accident – but told her that
           <strong>
            “it had to be a secret.”
           </strong>
           Once exposed, Dilek Edwards
           <strong>
            had to go
           </strong>
           .  It wasn’t about Dilek Edwards being “too cute” to work at Wall Street Chiropractic &amp; Wellness...
          </p>
          <p>
           When Stephanie Adams, Chief Financial Officer of Wall Street Chiropractic &amp; Wellness discovered her on staff on Oct. 30, 2013, Edwards claims she got a “frantic,” 1:31 a.m. text message from her that said, “You are NOT welcome any longer at Wall Street Chiropractic, DO NOT ever step foot in there again, and stay the F–K away from my husband and family.”
          </p>
          <p>
           Dilek’s classes fuse rhythmic vinyasa flow, integrated Ashtanga techniques, yoga philosophy, Ayurverdic approach, attentive injury prevention and the value of yoga for healing heart. Dilek is a Yoga Alliance RYT200 from India Chakra Yoga School. Teachers can register as a RYT® 200 if they have successfully completed a 200-hour yoga teacher training that is registered with Yoga Alliance. She also has a RYT500 from Om Yoga Center in New York City. Dilek Edwards studied at Istanbul Bilgi University, Cultural Studies Department, Graduate Student.

           Dr. Dhonden was the personal healer to the Dalai Lama, from 1961 to 1980. Born in 1927 in Tibet, he started practicing medicine at the age of 20. In 1959, he began practicing this time-honoured method [Ayureda] in India. Urged by the Dalai Lama to preserve this historic medicine system more profoundly, they established Men-Tsee-Khang, formally known as the Tibetan Medical and Astro Institute at Dharamshala.

           Adams’ hostility toward Dilek Edwards had absolutely nothing to do whether or not she was too cute or not.
           <strong>
            Edwards was a Buddhist Yoga booty “tantric” prostitute most likely connected to Keith Raniere, Dalai Lama and Nxivm PAN-theistic Buddhism

            and It's fair to say that the roots of "pizzagate" go to the depths of hell.

-Marcus Tullius Cicero

           <p>
            We, at pizzagate, are functioning with wisdom.  Wisdom, imo, is the most important word, in any language, that our civilization has.  The problem lies in the fact that relatively few humans have that quality today.

            Like the Red Dragon, the White Greyhound represents British royalty (House of Tudor) and the ancient Bythons. The Britons, also known as Celtic Britons or Ancient Britons, were Celtic people who inhabited Great Britain from the British Iron Age into the Middle Ages.  The Nicolais are Old European ILLUMINATI linked to the Rothschild Satanic Dynastic Family. The Translatio sancti Nicolai (Saint Nicolas)is a remarkable source for the study of the crusade. It contains information on various events and news of commercial concessions of which no other record exists and, first and foremost, it is the sole surviving text written in Venice by the Black Nobility which describes the early support given by local forces to the Knights Templar and First Crusade.

           <p>
            Count François de Nicolay (31 August 1919 – 21 November 1963) was a member of the House of Nicolay in France elected to the Senate of France.  In 1950, François de Nicolay married the American born Marie-Hélène van Zuylen van Nyevelt who owned De Haar Castle in Haarzuilens. Marie-Hélène van Zuylen van Nijevelt was also a descendant of the Rothschild Family (the granddaughter of Salomon James de Rothschild). François and Marie-Hélène had one son and heir (before their marriage was dissolved in 1956). Count Philippe de Nicolay (b. 1955), who is a director of Paris Orleans PA, a French investment bank belonging to the Rothschild family.[30]

             ILLUMINATI BALL– Baron Guy de &amp; Marie-Hélène Rothschild
            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            In 1957, she married her third cousin once-removed Baron Guy de Rothschild head of de Rothschild Freres Bank.  They were married on February 17, 1957 in New York City. This was the first time a head of one of the Rothschild families had married a non-Jewish spouse. Guy was forced to resign from the presidency of the Jewish community in France. Marie-Hélène, being Catholic, was required to get a papal dispensation in order to annul her first marriage so that she could remarry outside the Catholic faith.[31]
           </p>
           <p>
            Stephanie had a certain fascination with the ILLUMINATI witch, Marie-Hélène Rothschild. She wrote,  “There is a certain element of magic combined with the glamour and elegance of Marie-Helen de Rothschild. Long gone is the classic richness of art, fashion, and high society in our times. Perhaps we can invoke her special charm and zest when both hosting and attending fabulous events, by remembering that a true socialite is one who welcomes many different global cultures and backgrounds within her realm of socializing. Her beauty was indeed within, not just on the forefront, as her lovely spirit lives on by the sheer memory of her enchanting existence.”[32]
           </p>
           <p>
            We know in fact that Stephanie Adams had indeed intended to create her own demonic and Satanic Bloodline of Nicolai and Rothschild by her son, Vincent Nicolai. According to her Playboy pictorial, Stephanie Adams had already claimed that she was the direct descendant of two U.S. presidents, John Adams and John Quincy Adams, later discovering that her lineage traces back to the Old European Satanic Houses of Royalty and Knights Templar, the House of Plantagenet, Holy Roman Emperor Charlemagne, Merovingian Dynasty, as well as the Magna Carta Barons.

              You can Jew Jew Jew all you fucking want but in the long run your ignorance betrays you because Jew or not they could also be a pagan USURPER and hiding as  a "Jew"- I'll tell you people are REALLY confused about what a pagan jew is, yes he may be a Jew but he is not ALL jews and not ALL Jews are luciferian pieces of shit.... this forum really needs some work.

            Stephanie Adams was born July 24, 1970, raised in East Orange, New Jersey. She said that her mother once told a rather large group of people at one of her infamous SAMHAIN parties that she had been
            <strong>
             conceived of on SAMHAIN.

            Her mother had been or is a Old Religion Druid High Priestess and Witch.[18] In New Jersey, the annual October Witches’ Ball take place in Mount Holly. Mount Holly is about an hour outside of East Orange. Mount Holly is the site of the infamous witch trial of October 22, 1730. It is place traditionally associated with witches, witchcraft, devil worshipers, and the Jersey Devil. Traditionally, the Mount Holly Witches’ Ball have been a convention for Wicca practitioners. The Witches’ Ball in October is traditionally celebrated around SANHAIN.

            , Perly Lind (Pearlene Smith) and Ruth Joyce McMurrian. As a child, Stephanie said that she saw spirits and communicated with them. They sent her messages and signs. Her aunts were New York models and Druid Occult high priestesses. Joyce was expressly known as a “West Pointer“.

            Stephanie had two other McMurrian aunts in New Jersey that either one may have been her mother, Virginia and Nettie Hickney. However, there may have been an additional McMurrian sister born after the 1940 U.S. Census. The McMurrians were born and raised in Buena Vista, Marion County, Georgia. I don’t know the name of her mother. However, she did admit that her father’s name was “SALEM“-

            . I suppose that he was a Druid Witch, too. His family was associated with the Richmond Beneficial Insurance Co., Mulattoes, Druidism and black freemasonry since at least the era of Reconstruction.

            According to the notes in our family bible that is over a century old, we are direct descendants of two U.S. Presidents,
            <strong>
             John Adams and John Quincy Adams
            </strong>
            . But it wasn't until my father gave me his family bible that I was able to see and later trace an entire genealogical history, beyond just one surname and family lore. Along with tracing my son's other intriguing bloodline to the
            <strong>
             German "von Langenfelds"
            </strong>
            and the European
            <strong>
             "House of Nicolay"
            </strong>
            , after carefully and vigorously pursuing my own custom genealogy and DNA report, I most recently discovered that I have a unique and colorful lineage that includes
            <strong>
             Egyptian, African, Native American, Anglo-Saxon, French Norman, Ancient Briton, and Celtic European ancestry
            </strong>
            . My family ancestors include countless war heroes, a mysterious mulatto woman named
            <strong>
             Delphia
            </strong>
            , the father of her children named
            <strong>
             Dr. Nathaniel Terry Green
            </strong>
            who was from the
            <strong>
             historical Green family in Virginia
            </strong>
            , and other
            <strong>
             Sons of the American Revolution
            </strong>
            . As to my direct European lineage which consisted of numerous members of nobility, I went even beyond my relatives with the surnames "le Scrope", "de Neville", "de Beauchamp", "de Ferrers", my 32nd great grandmother, Nest Ferch Gruffydd, Princess of Wales, my 35th great grandmother, Godgifu, Countess of Mercia, who is more famously known as
            <strong>
             "Lady Godiva"
            </strong>
            , and traveled as far back as ancient relatives
            <strong>
             before B.C
            </strong>
            . My aristocratic relatives in England owned castles and were Barons, Counts, Earls, Lords, as well as members of the
            <strong>
             Knights Templar
            </strong>
            . Other ancestry linked back to Normandie and other parts of Europe where they were Dukes, Kings, Vikings, and more. I hope you will enjoy reading about my deeply involved family history, traveling through my exciting journey back with them in time,
            <strong>
             "from slavery to royalty"
            </strong>
            ,as I encourage others to be proud of who they are, where they come from, and to consider tracing their own interesting lineage as well.

            This woman, claiming to be a WITCH, WICCAN AND ancestor of ALL OF THE ABOVE, CONFIRMS that they are ALL ONE IN THE SAME, that these "great"  families of nobility are, in fact,
            <strong>
             <em>
              the illuminati
             </em>

            AND that they are intimately connected to the OCCULT...
           </p>
           <p>
            The rest of the story we have to tell, that they use these networks to trade in the illicit markets that these clandestine networks have trafficked in for centuries.

            A NY city cabby warned investigators she was really a vampire who threatened him with what he saw had been deadly Dracula teeth. Cabby Eric Darko told a hearing room that during a heated dispute with Stephanie that she “showed him her vampire teeth.” He also said that she a had a gun. NY police abused her in making an arrest. She filed an excessive force personal injury lawsuit against the police in 2006. In February 2012, a jury awarded her $1.2 million. Darko was fined and his license was revoked by the NYC Taxi and Limousine Commission. They even recommended that he get a psychiatric evaluation.

            When the Greeks arrived on Spanish soil around 600 b.c. they referred to the peninsula as Hesperia, meaning "land of the setting sun." When the Carthaginians came around 300 b.c. they called the country Ispania (from Sphan, "rabbit"), which means "land of the rabbits."

             You are right, spain does have quite a stake in this NWO thing, the King of Spain does yield a large amount of influence over the ruling families of the world, I think we are most likely talking about some of the same means to an end, yet you come here with such a strong aura of arrogance "follow the real white rabbit" I am tempted to dismiss you altogether. Unbelievable, such respect for someones material. Who are all these new guys anyway?

            Hugh Hefner started his Clowns In America Honeypot Operation the same year that 33rd degree Master Mason Walt Disney scoped out the land in Florida for his Mk-Ultra Trauma Conditioning facility in the Everglades.
           </p>
           <p>
            Hugh Hefners Playmates and Bunnies were trained extortionists. While regular consumers got Playboy magazine as a desensitization tool for pornography rich elite, politicians, dignitaries, sports stars and celebrities got the magazine as a catologue. For the right price you could have your semen collected (clones?) and recorded on video and audio. Imagine how many people Playboy enterprises has extorted over the years?
           </p>
           <p>
            The same goes for Disney, how many children were one on one conditioned on the rides at disneyworld and disneyland while the millions of others were programmed with Prince and Princess Programming through their media?
           </p>
           <p>
            Follow the white rabbit folks and MCBA, it is the key to understanding the overall brainwashing and extortion programs that have been let loose on the world since after WWII...

             Not clones, Eugenics.

            <p>
             The left is into eugenics. The goal is breeding better people, and exterminating people that are inferior. Hence why the planned parenthood locations are located in non white areas. They are not against wedlock babies, far from it, they are against dumb, weak people.

              I'm sayingthat there is MOST LIKELY A VERY LARGE POSSIBILITY THAT SEMEN SAMPLES WERE COLLECTED AND USED IN EXPERIMENTS IN CLONING. I don't need a "No" or "Not clones" - where do you people come from that talk like that I hate people that do that. "No, this is what is the deal...  blah blah blah... " be constructive not retarded.

               You need to lurk and read more. There is a known connection between Disney and many of the Eugenics fronts in America.

               A large portion of pizzagate is also connected to groups that fund Eugenics movements. Hefner was a very public face, and was used as an instrument of propaganda, so a lot of the connections to the eugenics movements in both the private sector and in the government are subtle, but are there.

                 I HIGHLY doubt that they are using celebrity semen to genetically
                 <em>
                  improve
                 </em>
                 them, they are about as inbred and psychotic as they come. IN THIS CONTEXT, semen samples were collected to mess with the gene pool of hollywood and aid in some of Mengele's weirdness.

            "Sybil Leek often said that she was a DRUID, not just a Witch and that DRUIDS were like the [power elite] priest class while Witches were the working class among Craft practitioners. There is a big difference between a DRUID and Witch. No matter how much Stephanie Adams learned, knew about, dedicated herself to EVIL for them, she couldn’t breach that power elite gap.  Project MK OFTEN/MK ULTRA was also about infiltrating and integrating the covert old religion aristocratic-royal DRUID PRIESTS CLASS into the fabric of America’s power, wealth and authority."

            Now think, how many "witches" do you think are in the modelling business? Seems like a perfect place to hide to me, on the edge of the art world and fashion, female and highly desirable...
           </p>
           <p>
            A main theme and point of this thread is that Stephanie Adams very vocally and very publically exposed her ancestral lineage to be very closely linked and intimate to the
            <strong>
             Occult and Occult New Age
            </strong>
            practices. I think this is probably, most likely the reason she was killed.

            Another thing this incident indicates, if PrinceRay is right about his assumption that this was an orchestrated takeover of her business,
            <em>
             there had to be quite a clientele racked up at this place and much influence to be wielded...
