It about an elite abuse sex party and involves eighteen teenagers who are kidnapped and tortured and sexually abused. Scenes with naked teen servers, people eating shit, and children and teens being raped. NSFW and very disturbing. It\'s came out in 1975 and is based off a book written in 1785. Make no mistake. This book from the 18th century was about elite child abuse and all the sick depravity they do and the movie shows this. However, the movie changed the time period to the 1940\'s. NSFW at all.</p>

<p>The Wikipedia article on it.</p>
<p>Salò, or the 120 Days of Sodom (Italian: Salò o le 120 giornate di Sodoma), titled Pasolini\'s 120 Days of Sodom on English-language prints[3] and commonly referred to as simply Salò (Italian: [saˈlɔ]), is a 1975 Italian-French horror art film[a] directed by Pier Paolo Pasolini. The film is a loose adaptation of the book The 120 Days of Sodom by the Marquis de Sade. The film focuses on four wealthy, corrupt Italian libertines, during the time of the fascist Republic of Salò (1943–1945). The libertines kidnap eighteen teenagers and subject them to four months of extreme violence, sadism and sexual and mental torture.&quot;</p>
<p>The film is separated into four segments with intertitles, based on Dante\'s Divine Comedy.</p>
<p>&quot;Anteinferno</p>
<p>In 1944 in the Republic of Salò, the Fascist-occupied portion of Italy, four wealthy men of power, the Duke, the Bishop, the Magistrate and the President, agree to marry each other\'s daughters as the first step in a debauched ritual. They recruit four teenage boys to act as guards (dressed with uniforms of Decima Flottiglia MAS) and four young soldiers (called &quot;studs&quot;, &quot;cockmongers&quot; or &quot;fuckers&quot;), who are chosen because of their large penises. They then kidnap nine young men and nine young women and take them to a palace near Marzabotto.</p>
<p>Circle of Manias / Girone delle Manie&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Circle of Manias / Girone delle Manie Accompanying the libertines at the palace are four middle-aged prostitutes, also collaborators, whose job it is to recount arousing stories for the men, who sadistically exploit their victims. During the many days at the palace, the four men devise increasingly abhorrent tortures and humiliations for their own pleasure. During breakfast, the daughters enter the dining hall naked to serve food. One of the studs trips and rapes a daughter in front of the crowd, which laughs at her cries of pain. Intrigued, the President moons several slaves before prompting the stud to perform anal sex on him and the Duke sings \'Sul Ponte di perati\'. Signora Vaccari uses a mannequin to demonstrate to the young men and women how to properly masturbate a penis and one of the girls tries to escape, only to have her throat cut. Signora Vaccari continues with her story. Two victims, Sergio and Renata, are forced to marry. The ceremony is interrupted when the Duke fondles several victims and prostitutes. At the end, Sergio and Renata are forced to fondle each other and the men rape them to stop them from having sex with each other. During this, the Magistrate engages with the Duke in three-way intercourse.</p>
<p>Another day, the victims are forced to act like dogs. When one of the victims, Lamberto, refuses, the Magistrate whips him and tortures the President\'s daughter by tricking her into eating food containing nails.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Circle of Shit / Girone della Merda Signora Maggi relates her troubled childhood and her coprophilia. As she tells her story, the President notices that one of the studs has an erection and fondles him; another stud uses a female victim\'s hand to masturbate himself. She also explains how she killed her mother over a dispute about her prostitution and Renata cries, remembering the murder of her own mother. The Duke, sexually excited at the sound of her cries, begins verbally abusing her. The Duke orders the guards and studs to undress her. During this, she begs God for death and the Duke punishes her by defecating and forcing her to eat his feces. The President leaves to masturbate. Later, the other victims are presented with a meal of human feces. During a search for the victim with the most beautiful buttocks, Franco is picked and promised death in the future.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Circle of Blood / Girone del Sangue Later, there is a Black Mass-like wedding between the studs and the men of power. The men angrily order the children to laugh, but they are too grief-stricken to do so. The Pianist and Signora Vaccari tell jokes to make the victims laugh. The wedding ceremony ensues with each man of power exchanging rings with a stud. After the wedding, the Bishop consummates the marriage and receives anal sex from his stud. The Bishop then leaves to examine the captives in their rooms, where they start systematically betraying each other: Claudio reveals that Graziella is hiding a photograph, Graziella reveals that Eva and Antiniska are having a secret sexual affair and Ezio, a collaborator and the black servant are shot dead after being found having sex, but not before Ezio makes a defiant Socialist salute. Victim Umberto Chessari is appointed to replace Ezio.</p>
<p>Toward the end, the remaining victims are called out to determine which of them will be punished. Graziella is spared due to her betrayal of Eva and Rino is spared due to his submissive relationship with the Duke. Those who are called are given a blue ribbon and sentenced to a painful death. The victims huddle together and cry and pray in the bathroom. They are then raped, tortured and murdered through methods such as branding, hanging, scalping, burning and having their tongues and eyes cut out, as each libertine takes his turn to watch as a voyeur. The soldiers shake hands and bid each other farewell and the Pianist commits suicide due to her grief, leaping from a window.</p>
<p>The film\'s final shot is of two young soldiers, who had witnessed and collaborated in all the atrocities, dancing a simple waltz together; one asks the name of the other\'s girlfriend back at home.&quot;</p>

<p>This is the description of the book from Wikipedia.</p>
<p>&quot;It tells the story of four wealthy male libertines who resolve to experience the ultimate sexual gratification in orgies. To do this, they seal themselves away for four months in an inaccessible castle in the heart of the Black Forest,[5] with a harem of 36 victims, mostly male and female teenagers, and engage four female brothel keepers to tell the stories of their lives and adventures. The women\'s narratives form an inspiration for the sexual abuse and torture of the victims, which gradually mounts in intensity and ends in their slaughter.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;The 120 Days of Sodom is set in a remote medieval castle, high in the mountains and surrounded by forests, detached from the rest of the world, either at the end of Louis XIV\'s reign or at the beginning of the Régence.[citation needed]</p>
<p>The novel takes place over five months, November to March. Four wealthy libertines lock themselves in a castle, the Château de Silling, along with a number of victims and accomplices (the description of Silling matches Sade\'s own castle, the Château de Lacoste). Since they state that the sensations produced by the organs of hearing are the most erotic, they intend to listen to various tales of depravity from four veteran prostitutes, which will inspire them to engage in similar activities with their victims.[citation needed]</p>
<p>The novel is notable for not existing in a complete state, with only the first section being written in detail. After that, the remaining three parts are written as a draft, in note form, with de Sade\'s notes to himself still present in most translations. Either at the outset, or during the writing of the work, de Sade had evidently decided he would not be able to complete it in full and elected to write out the remaining three-quarters in brief and finish it later.[citation needed]</p>
<p>The story does portray some black humor, and de Sade seems almost light-hearted in his introduction, referring to the reader as &quot;friendly reader&quot;. In this introduction, he contradicts himself, at one point insisting that one should not be horrified by the 600 passions outlined in the story because everybody has their own tastes, but at the same time going out of his way to warn the reader of the horrors that lie ahead, suggesting that the reader should have doubts about continuing. Consequently, he glorifies as well as vilifies the four main protagonists, alternately declaring them freethinking heroes and debased villains, often in the same passage.&quot;</p>

           I just saw it from YouTube chanel Pizza_Dog who has been exposing Pizzagate. It about an elite abuse sex party and involves eighteen teenagers who are kidnapped and tortured and sexually abused. Scenes with naked teen servers, people eating shit, and children and teens being raped. NSFW and very disturbing. It's came out in 1975 and is based off a book written in 1785. Make no mistake. This book from the 18th century was about elite child abuse and all the sick depravity they do and the movie shows this. However, the movie changed the time period to the 1940's. NSFW at all.

           I've never seen this movie ever spoken about on these forums so I assume most of us have never heard of it. This is one of the sickest things I have ever seen in my life.

            Read De Sade's 120 days years ago. Of course de Sade might of participated in said scat themed and other disgusting sexual orgies. He wrote the most in prison on the back of toilet roll.

            I was wondering how many bloody years it would take this community to finally bring up this movie. How you guys have missed it this long is beyond me but you need to dissect the hell out of it because you'll find some very real truths in it. Even though it's so disgusting in parts you'll have a tough time getting though it. It's been banned for a reason in many countries.

             This and A Serbian Film are the most horrific movies anyone will ever see but both carry alot of truth. Just extremely hard to watch.

            I’ve always liked strange movies, but anyone who suggested this one would quickly become someone I didn’t want to know. And this was in the early 2000’s. Such a horrid film, and I’ve only seen screen shots.

             Not an accident. After g bush stole the 2000 election, movies &amp; publishing were mostly about solve the murder, murder and horror.Music also took a turn for the dark side. This is fascism, know for hatred of women and children. Have heard that when the nazis invaded Italy, a lot of the boys were being raped by them.....the mothers went to Germany and told the wives what their husbands were doing. It stopped.

            Of course they change the time period to the 40s to villify the italian fascist era.  Fascists n nationalists are the only governments that tried to root out such corruption and usurious inspired moral depravity

            Saw this movie while ago and it was very wtf, based on de Sade book look how subtle marketing in recent years brought back bdsm to daylight as a popular thing ,
Covert programming for masses to reverse super saint and un natural sex deniality in Christianity to something more wicked ? Interesting times we are living but looking at media and information as mass programming tool it’s interesting to see those methods as population control as most of population will not break certain rules and go along popular stream so it’s all about leak and trend control which mixed with some herd control ability give you guys like “ordo ab chao”’group , fun times of possibilities we live in , looking at sex pre Roman cultures like Etruskans were much more liberal and peace loving , wonder what that trend would bring us now

            What's funny is how much of Nazi Germany and Fascist Italy had kikes as prominent officials yet the dumbass neo-Nazis don't acknowledge it. Joseph Goebbels was a Khazar.

             The Nazis didn't need Jewish blood in their ranks (this is a distraction); their whole ideology is occult.

             I wonder who's the kike here. Where's the proof for your claims, like the one about Goebbels, for example? Of course there is none, but try your best anyway. And besides, what's the point of your post? Pasolini was a communist faggot. His film is simply a projection of his own depraved mind and political affiliations onto the fascist enemies of his youth. It is fantasy and does not reflect the Fascist regime in Italy, in case that is what you are feebly attempting to suggest.

             Well, Hitler was technically jewish. At least his ethnicity.

              Your username rings true. Where's the evidence for Hitler being "technically Jewish"? I keep hearing people like you run their mouth like this yet never is there any evidence produced.
