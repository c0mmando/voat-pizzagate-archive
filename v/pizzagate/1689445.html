            If anything, even if conways were all into the orphanage scams/abductions, it would be the other way around, wouldn't it?
           </p>
           <p>
            How can anyone think the "CIA spy" aka us consul was employed by the orphanage in Haiti when actually she had full time job in neighboring Dominican Republic.?

             The hyperspecific word games are what the deceitful enemy always play. Just like Flynn having to resign because he supposedly talked about sanctions, when he was only asked about them.
