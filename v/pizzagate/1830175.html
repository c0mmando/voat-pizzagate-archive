<p>More:</p>
<p>&quot;The non deliverable currency forwards which are used by participating firms of the SFEMC are taking forward bets on rates that actually DO NOT EXIST AT ALL. The contracts are essentially fully trusted disguised dollar payments between participants and brokers. The system is an anonymised and disguised plarform for vast illcicit payments worldwide between e.g. hedge funds and people-trafficking operations or drug cartels via the IB intermediaries.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Master LL Quant Dual is the name of a UBS client which shared the same postal address as LMR’s office but had a different and unusual name. I discovered trade contracts in the name of Master LL Quant Dual, counterparty UBS bank, in the scans folder of the shared drive, signed by Shane Cullinane. Therefore the claim that Shane Cullinane was not familiar with this entity is clearly a deliberate false statement. I strongly suspect that these contracts are not legitimate trades but may be US dollar payments disguised as trades in exotic currency derivatives, specifically “Non Deliverable Forward” contracts. The existence of all the trading in these instruments was kept secret from me during my time at the firm and these contracts contributed to our profits whilst not being factored into the risk and positions. I know this absolutely for certain as I wrote the bespoke system (referred to elsewhere in the proceedings as Risk Ninja) that calculated all of these. For these trades to exist in secret from me was a strong indication that they were not legitimate. When I investigated the contractual terms and how the market operated in great detail, I became quite convinced that these signed scans were evidence of money laundering on a large scale. There were dozens of these trade contracts in the scans folder with the contracts signed by Shane Cullinane; some on behalf of Master LL Quant Dual and others on behalf of LMR. 160. I was asked to represent a list of the currencies associated with these trades as US dollar in our bespoke system formerly known as Risk Ninja. The system calculated P&amp;L, positions and risk at a position level and across trading books. I can say with total certainty that the currency positions created by the trades in Non Deliverable Forward contributed to the profits, but were not accounted for in positions (they showed up as USD cash) or in the risk, where they were also treated as USD cash. At the time I was told that the repeated appearance of obscure currency positions, for example in Korean Won, was due to a bug in the upstream Sophis system and that actually these should be shown as being US dollars. I do not mean that a currency conversion took place at a conversion rate between the two currencies; I mean that a position of 1 million KRW from the upstream system would be treated as 1 million USD by Risk Ninja. To users of the system they would never see these positions except as USD cash. This was the case for all the currencies that were being traded in these contracts, but the existence of this trading was kept entirely secret from me. I do not believe that the trades that I have seen would make sense in the strategies that they were being booked in, and it is impossible that any legitimate trading should have been kept secret from me given that my bespoke system needed to model all our positions in all instrument types.&quot;</p>',

            Can we please stay on topic in these posts so as not to dilute the original point?? Are posters who do this here thick, or are they shills?  Bc taking a post about a world system of hidden money based out of China and turning it into a debate about Flat Earth or homosexuality is nothing but unhelpful, to say the least.  Hard for me to believe voters are that dumb so I'll probably add a few to my shill list. And if you're not... Then consider being more helpful and not hijacking OPs post for your own agendas.

            You were the one who wanted sources from newspapers. Newspapers are MSM. They can put in what they want (including obits), or leave it out.  Whatever best suits their agenda.  Advertising that this guy is dead is probably not in their best interest. Hope this makes sense now.

             No we don't think that, discovering FE is a good start to understanding how and why our world works the way it does, but its not an imminent threat on their power and control.

             A. Dover claimed he had proof of some money laundering schemes involving the Clintons. He posted here trying to get some help on how to go about exposing it, he gave his full name and wasn't hiding behind anything. That was his mistake. I imagine that's why they offed him, not because he was a Flat Earther (which he was open and honest about)
            </p>
            <p>
             Lesson: Don't dismiss someone's claims based on their peripheral beliefs. Investigate what they have to say/their evidence before casting any judgment on their character. He might have had the smoking gun- and we all looked the other way because he was a crazy flat earther.

            Could this be part of the money laundering operation that Ronald Bernard spoke about?  Taking illegitimate money from one of 8,000 people (and intelligence services and terrorist organizations) and getting into the system?

            Money Laundering that could take down "crown" involving Clinton Found.

            Aaron D. mother worked as psychologist at Tav. Inst. Aaron stated she is involved. Tavis.  Is where FBIanon said the sickest part of all of this exists. He said Soros owns the US &amp; Soros owns Tavis. Some of us have bravely researched all of this in below threads and other places. It is real and terrifying. Tavis. is a giant laboratory involved in human experiments. It always has been. What goes on inside is not know to the public ever.

             Damn straight! Tav is behind it all.  It's a psychological warfare think tank. They are the ones behind how to brainwash with entertainment, media, education, internet and political correctness. Soros also has "universities" around the world and Clintons have some in the US.
            </p>
            <p>
             It's also been rumored that either Nazi scientist that performed horrible experimental crap on kids/twins either were doing it FOR Tav or went to Tav after to report findings and still do MK Ultra type, torture studies. Which could mean they train CIA, M5/6 and like. They are also the main educators to top schools like MIT. So when we see "studies show, young kids that think they're the opposite sex or youn kids can have sex with adults and it's ok..." type shit, they are the studies manipulating peoples minds to believe this shit.

              Much of what you're saying needs to be investigated.

              However, you seem to be suggesting that they are creating trans-sexuals.
Do you have any proof of that?
             </p>
             <p>
              And, of course, trans-sexuality is entirely different from pedophilia which not something the public supports.
             </p>
             <p>
              Trans-sexuality is not a crime -- adults having sex with children is a crime.

               Transsexual is not a crime but the moral break down of society is what I'm talking about. If these Satanic Elitists want Paedophilia to become an accepted norm, the way to do it is to slowly break down the moral fibers of people.
              </p>
              <p>
               Through entertainment, music and education, there has been more sexuality, violence and push of transsexuality to become a norm. Christianity is being pushed out. Media covers up rapes and pedo crimes and shouts from roof tops all the SJW slanted news.  Paedophilia is next to become "mainstream" with some states pushing for lower consent laws and less time served for Pedos.
              </p>
              <p>
               It's common knowledge that it's been studied if you see something shocking the first time, it truly is revolting but the more you show it, read about it or hear about it, the less shocking and more accepting people can become. This is exactly what they are doing to the people. I think the first time someone saw a dude dressed as and becoming a woman it was pretty damn shocking. Now it's kind of becoming a norm. Or, they have brian washed Society that if you say it's NOT normal, you are called a bigot, racist, Nazi...so the people are silenced.
              </p>
              <p>
               It doesn't  take actual documents to see this. It's been happening for years. Then in here in voat, a thread was started where there were connections being looked at between Antifa, Soros and NAMBLA. (men boy love) They are also trying to tag into the LBGT (qxyz...never ending letters) with P. Paedophilia. It's all there, right before our eyes.

                I understand the point you're trying to make, but you also seem to be trying to suggest that transsexual problems are something
being created rather than mistakes of nature.  I don't think that's something we really know at this time what the cause may be.
It does seem to be clear, however, that pedophiles can be created by torture and sexual abuse and MKULTRA has done that.
It's not necessarily the same that transsexuality can be created.
Sexuality isn't a problem; it is the debasing of human sexuality that is the problem.
And I certainly don't see anyone pushing transsexuality to become a "norm" as it is hardly any more easy for
transsexuals to divulge their problems to the public and try to explain it to them than it was for homosexuals to
come out of the closet and confront "religious norms" and expect society to accept them after a thousand years
and more of religious propaganda against them, backed and supported by government.
               </p>
               <p>
                You also keep claiming that society will accept pedophilia as a "norm" yet every sign is that the public is repulsed by
sexual assaults on children and it is still a CRIME -- and you show no evidence that anyone in American in any way
supports pedophiles.  True -- criminals support pedophilia because it serves their purpose.  But that's not true of the public.
               </p>
               <p>
                Again -- you keep repeating your fears, but I see no basis for what you're saying actually happening.
Again -- sexual assault of children is a crime.
               </p>
               <p>
                I'm not quite up on Antifa, but Soros as far as I can see is a criminal and any organization -- Nambla or anyone else -- 
who supports sexual relations with anyone underage age -- male or female -- is suggesting criminal activity.
               </p>
               <p>
                Again -- you're seem to be concerned about something that is criminal and as far as I can see will remain criminal.
               </p>
               <p>
                Elites want destruction by any means they can arrange it -- destruction and death.

                 Not sure how to make what I'm trying to say more clear.  I am not saying transsexual or homosexuality in itself is a horrible thing (i personally don't agree with it but whatever). What I'm saying is that there is a push to more and more shocking, unacceptable things be normal to pave the way for even way more socially unacceptable (Paedophilia) come through. It's the desensitizing of the public psyche.
                </p>
                <p>
                 Do you think 10yrs ago, a stage show like this one in pics would be normal? Today, it appears it is. Again, adults, they can do what they want. But right now the next push orf "normal" IS Paedophilia. I've seen the "Love is Love" (with meaning, an adult with a kid) all over FB, YT and Twitter and no one bans them or takes it down. But those calling out Pedos are banned. It is a psychological push to normalize basically rape of kids by saying everyone should have the right to "love" anyone. Conservative voices being silenced, SJWs (who seem more willing to accept the "love of everyone") is displayed every where.

                  What you are saying is clear . . . that you seem to see homosexuality and transsexualism as something akin to pedophilia.
You are equally worried about them.  And in repeating that "personally don't agree with it" you make that ultra clear.
And, I'm sure we've had exactly this conversation at some earlier time, but perhaps you had a different name then?
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  OVERALL, it is clear that the right wing need is for violence in our societies -- disruption.
And long ago they decided that one way to do that was to introduce and increase violence, drug use (legal and illegal), pornography
and sexual abuse/torture.  This violence is the only way the right wing can rise -- that's always been true - and is still true today.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  And, yes, this is a purposeful move on the part of the right wing.  I don't know if anyone knows the number or percentage of 
pedophiles who appear naturally, but I do recall reading studies which showed that a certain percentage of those sexually
abused will become pedophiles.  However, even if no child is sexually abused, it seems that at least one pedophile will arise.
I don't know if they consider circumcision as sexual abuse/torture, but I certainly do -- and I think that ritual should be included
in considering whether a child is sexually abused and tortured.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  Again, sexual assault on a child is a CRIME and I see no indications that the public finds that crime anything but repulsive.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  I've seen nothing like that on YouTube, but if my memory is correct I believe that it is being said that Facebook permits discussion
between pedophiles on it's website.  Don't know about Twitter, either.  And if I use FB or Twitter it is for a very limited purpose and
very rarely.  Keep in mind that discussion between pedophiles isn't a crime.
                  <br/>
                  There are some websites which are accused of protecting the posting of child pornography which should be illegal everywhere.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  There is no longer anything politically which can be considered "conservative" -- anymore than there is anything that can be 
consider "liberal" politically.  The last liberal president we had was JFK and everyone after him were people who either 
participated in the coup on JFK and our people's government or who protected the coup and cover up.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  Conservatives existed at one time and they weren't religious fanatics but they were people who protected the environment.
Who didn't permit corporate exploitation of nature.  They were people who protected Separation of Church &amp; State.
Religion/Christianity is one of the major tools in the right wing tool box for conquest as we've seen throughout history.
Still being used today as a fascist means of takeover of our government and to destroy public education.

                    We can agree to disagree -- but any time you create comments which are intended to create intolerance

                    I don't know what you think you prove in regard to Berkley/NAMBLA.
No one here supports NAMBLA.  And what makes you think that any homosexuals support NAMBLA.

                   <p>
                    I'm not sure that anyone really knows as yet what is going on at Berkley where too often our CIA and
FBI are controlling events there as we often saw in colleges and universities across the nation during the VN war.

                     It's been all over Twitter...connections with Antifa and BAMN/NAMBLA. Actually, there's pics of Antifa signs at riots with BAMN on the signs. Hell, look at threads in here with the connections. My comments are not to create intolerance for homosexuals UNLESS Pedos are using that as a guise for screwing kids, which they are doing.

                      You're suggesting that an Anti-fascist group is supporting an organization like NAMBLA which advocates
sex with children younger than 16 years of age?  (Which is what I presume NAMBLA is doing?)
                     </p>
                     <p>
                      The ACLU however defended NAMBLA in a "free speech" case which had nothing to do with any NAMBLA agenda re sex with underage males.

                     <p>
                      In suggesting that homosexuals should not have full human and sexual rights, you are spreading intolerance for homosexuals.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                      Also, in trying to link homosexuals with pedophiles and pedophile activities which is UN-TRUE in both cases according to studies.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                      Yes, Keep spreading the word of the CIA/MKULTRA involvement in this which isn't just in US, but seems they are also involved
as UK/MKUTRA and in Australia, as well.

                      This also links them to common cause with the RCC which is also linked to these pedophile rings in UK and Belgium and Australia
and likely in Ireland, as well.

                       You obviously just reply to posts without checking info or reading anything. Antifa is not supporting NAMBLA. Antifa is made up of a bunch of young sheep that probably don't work. Antifa is FUNDED by BAMN and from what some have found, NAMBLA ties. Antifa can not function without financial support. Ask yourself why BAMN is in the protestors signs? Ask why a former BAMN came out, speaking about how they snatch up runaways. It was here in a thread...READ for yourself.

                       And what studies are you quoting? From Tavistock? Do you know anything about Tavistock and their "studies" that is then given to the top prestigious schools in the US and spread as truth? And again, for the FOURTH time, I never said homosexuals do not deserve rights UNLESS it is used as a cover for PEDOS. You are beyond dense

                        A 1998 Study in the Journal of the American Medical Association found that 90% of pedophiles are men, and 95% of these individuals are heterosexual.**

                         Perhaps the most egregious and damaging claim promulgated by anti-gay groups is the claim that homosexuality is intrinsically linked to pedophilia and child sexual abuse.  The social science research on sexual orientation and child sexual abuse clearly disproves the claim that homosexuals are more likely to molest children.

                         A 1998 study in the Journal of the American Medical Association found that 90% of pedophiles are men, and 95% of these individuals are heterosexual.  One researcher explained this statistic by noting, "Gay men desire consensual sexual relations with other adult men.  Pedophiles are usually adult men who are sexually attracted to pre-pubescent children.  They are rarely sexually attracted to other adults.  In fact, research has indicated that gay men and lesbians are LESS likely than heterosexuals to sexually abuse children.  Two studies that examined the sexual orientation of convicted child molesters found that less than 1% in one study and 0% in the other were lesbian or gay.  One psychologist reviewed the existing social science literature on the relationship between sexuality and child sexual abuse and found that "a gay man is no more likely  than a straight man to perpetrate sexual activity with children."  Further, "cases of perpetration of sexual behavior with a pre-pubescent child by an adult lesbian are virtually nonexistent."

                         Gay rights activists, like all advocates for children's welfare, oppose child sexual abuse and support equitable age of consent laws that help prevent and punish such abuse.

                         At least 110,000 children are waiting to be adopted in the US.  Approximately 588,00 children are currently in foster care.  Barring gay men and lesbians from adopting or foster parenting decreases the number of potential suitable homes for children in need.

                         Children who remain in foster care for much of their childhood, as do tens of thousands of American children, are more likely to have emotional problems.  Some children in foster care live in 20 or more homes by the time they reach the age of 18.  Barring gay men and lesbians from adopting or foster parenting is not simply unjust and unethical; it also decreases the number of potential suitable homes for children in need.

                         A review of 352 medical records of children evaluated for sexual abuse during a 12-month period at a Denver children's hospital found that less than 1% had been abused by a gay man or a lesbian.  Of 269 adult perpetrators of child abuse identified among the 352 cases of abuse, only two were  gay or lesbian.  The vast majority of the children in the study (82%) "were suspected of being abused by a man or a woman who was, or had been, in a heterosexual relationship with a relative of the child."  And the review concluded that in this sample, " a child's risk of being molested by his or her relative's heterosexual partner is over 100X greater [than the risk of being molested] by someone who might be identifiable as being homosexual, lesbian, or bisexual."

              The Nazi scientists &amp; Tav. Are one &amp; the same. Yes they did/do experiments. It should explain everything that a statue of S. Freud still stands on its secret grounds.

             <p>
              They were intimately involved with the making and supporting of Hitler. Dr. Carl Jung was actually a secret agent who worked with Allen Dulles first director of CIA. Many of these "doctors/pyschologists" are secret agents.Most are members of secret societies.
             </p>
             <p>
              Don't believe me. Have proof. Eye witness testimony.
Tav. has direct offshoot locations in the U.S. 
No one wants to talk about it. They have committed mass psychological warfare on the worlds populations.

               So very true.   It's a sad society in which we live.   They have trained us to be followers not thinkers.   Those that are thinkers are alone.    I can remember all to well trying to talk to people, they don't want to hear it and don't believe they can change it

            Ever since Obama dropped the super secret TPP like a hot potato when Hillary lost I was figuring it had something to do with human trafficking. Then Trump signed EO to stop it first thing and made it even more suspicion....NAFTA probably too with all their slave labor etc.

               Greer and the whole project is disinfo. There are no Aliens. Earth is a flat motionless plane. If "aliens" exist they come from lands beyond Antarctica(per Admiral Byrd), Not trillions of light years away.

                Exactly. I remember watching Greer years ago when that film came out, couldn't help but laugh and make fun of him throughout the whole thing. Whole thing is complete and utter bs.

                I trust things Cathy o Brien has said though, specifically about the elitists she was around and abused by.. they'd call themselves Gods, Aliens, Demons, etc to make you feel powerless.. but in actuality they are just human. She did a much better job of explaining it then I can. God delusion and Alien delusion are one of the same. Just new age bs

              I hope people read the details of what you posted. How anyone can deny the CIA involvement in mind control en mass is beyond me. They admit to it over and over. Specifically in these documents they are discussing kidnapping &amp; tooth extractions. Using frequencies to control moods &amp; population control.

              Humanity has been one giant experiment for them to screw with according to their wicked plans.

              I would steer you in the direction of
              <a href="https://youtu.be/oHxGQjirV-c">
               Dr Steven Greer on How The Secret Government Works
              </a>
              but there seems to be a lot of people trying to discredit him on here, however I believe him and feel a lot of this links in to Pizzagate and other "conspiracies".
             </p>
             <p>
              This free energy is also discussed in a documentary called
              <a href="https://youtu.be/lEV5AFFcZ-s">
               Thrive
              </a>
              I haven't watched it in a while so couldn't tell you the names right now sorry. I believed that this was common knowledge amongst the red pilled but again a lot of people seem to disagree. I do believe in it. I believe in energy and vibrations and their is a closed mindedness of the world in that way.

              Not fucking suprising about missing clips.   There was a full length doc on yt with soros trying to normalize his idea of 'Open Society' as a society where no one knows the truth and ALL the media present an asymmetrical POV (meaning they all lie).  After I made a thread on voat about it the motherfuckers deleted it.  Pretty sure there's torrents of it floating around the digital space tho.
