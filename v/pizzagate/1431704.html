<p>Treat each other as normal human beings. Don\'t dissent. Don\'t stand by when it\'s happening, speak up. We encourage each other to spread information. Not everything is provable - duh - it\'s an investigation! We are investigating - a job no one else will do. Anyway, to my friends, warm hearted and kind, caring people out there ~ hello.</p>
<p><strong>Do not trust me. Do not trust anyone.</strong></p>
<p>I come from reddit, like many of you. Banned, locked, censored on the &quot;usual&quot; subreddits. We made amazing progress there, identifying bots, understanding our opponents, and discovering truth! I will address those concerns below, and then express my thoughts on moderation current events, our counter-ops, my background, and some words of encouragement.</p>
<p>First, we started manually collecting bot data on reddit, just simply writing names in spreadsheet, then downloading their post histories. That was several weeks ago. Next we aggregated RES data to compare anomalies. Crude, but made sorting faster. With histories, we finally finished a lexicon filter, that allowed us to spot account sharing. We started tracking &quot;identities&quot; across subreddits and across user accounts. We have a pretty decent overall picture of which identities are logged in at a given moment. Some are smarter than others, we\'re fighting 3 distinct disinformation campaigns - hell, consider this one too - as it won\'t appear differently. They will mimic this thread, watch. Let this post contain the real history of things: November 23, 2016. Today, we\'ve advanced far past old techniques, able to identify real life friend graphs in near real-time, with the help of some very useful open source tools! Metabase is a wonderful tool for us tool to show these friend relationships. I\'ll have another essay on this topic shortly - RemindMe! 1 hour: &quot;topographical analysis&quot;.</p>
<p>To keep this post concise, we were able to honeypot them by installing an S3 image, which ran a custom AMI on their own AWS accounts, obtaining username/passwords for some network access. Some were smart enough to delete contents, but we still have some.</p>
<p>In summary: they all have one thing in common, trying to dissent you. Make you look away. Make you give up. Don\'t listen to them.</p>
<p><strong><strong><strong>On current events / moderation.</strong></strong></strong></p>
<p>Why are we trying to be more aggressive in shutting down conversation related to child rape - on a precedent of moderation we\'ve never seen before.</p>
<p>If anything, we should be given EXTRA ability to talk about the child rape. Not less.</p>
<p>Find it surprising that lately, an unprecedented amount of moderation has occurred, in record time? What a coincidence.</p>
<p><strong><strong><strong>Counter Ops</strong></strong></strong></p>
<p>This is the part where we data-mine them, and find out who they really are! Word of advice, be careful, but they ARE easy to catch, shout out to the greyhats.</p>
<p>High karma accounts have been purchased in high volumes, mostly 4+5 year old accounts. The only pattern that matters, is their speech behavior. Do they dissent? Do they advocate stopping? Do they tell someone to take their meds? That\'s their strategy.</p>

<p>First wave was here to avoid conversation about Assange\'s death, or the strange behavior of WikiLeaks. We\'re now at the third wave of attacks (as far as we can tell so far). Don\'t listen to ANYONE trying to change your mind. Research on your own. don\'t let anyone stop you. Only dissenters will stop you. Tell you you\'re wrong. Don\'t let them stop you. Don\'t let them stop you.</p>
<p><strong><strong><strong>Why should we trust you?</strong></strong></strong>
You shouldn\'t. Don\'t trust me, don\'t trust anyone. I encourage research. Our only message is for research, and care and compassion for children, above all else.</p>
<p>I\'m here to speak a message of Love. Of Compassion. Of Kindness. The protection of children.</p>
<p><strong><strong><strong>Compassion will win</strong></strong></strong>
Don\'t get overwhelmed. This is a lifestyle. We are here to defend children, for life. We will fight however long it takes. We are doing the right thing. Key point of attack is to waste people\'s time.</p>
<p>They are going to bait you into useless arguments (call em when you spot em!) to make you repeat yourself. If someone is arguing with you about a point you already made before - it\'s a diversion.</p>
<p>You know how kind, normal human beings act, right? Well, call the obvious bullshit. We don\'t dissent. We
hear all sides. We encourage discussion and more research - we never ever attack information seekers. 
We never, ever dissent discussion.</p>

<p>Introductory must read(!) book to cult abuse and pedophocracy: <a href="http://docdro.id/rB4FcAi">http://docdro.id/rB4FcAi</a></p>
<p>Brief ReCap</p>
<p>The purpose of all this digging is to uncover networks involved in the trafficking, sexual exploitation and ritual abuse of children.
A few days before the election Spirit Cooking dropped =&gt; <a href="https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/15893">https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/15893</a></p>
<p>Basically these idiots participate in creepy pseudo occult rituals. They do stuff ranging from dumping fake blood on efiggies of children, cut their hands open, mix blood and semen, probably drinking it, and engage in fake cannibalism. We speculate that they probably do these things for reals in other contexts.
John and Tony Podesta, the Molesta brothers look like the suspects in Maddy McCann\'s kidnapping (Murder)
In addition to exactly matching the description of the suspects John\'s emails which correspond to the time period relevant to the kidnapping were deleted, probably years before the Podesta leak occurred.</p>
<p>They have homes filled with creepy art, some of which is pedophilic in nature. Many of their leaked emails are cryptic and include pedophilic symbolism. Some are quite blatant, for example this email discussing swimming children as entertainment: <a href="https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/49435">https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/49435</a></p>
<p>The Clinton\'s, the Podesta\'s and the Democrats were tied to Comet Ping Pong a &quot;family friendly&quot; pizza joint in Washington D.C. Upon inspection it was discovered that CPP was creepy as fuck: much associated with them is cryptic, sexual and pedophilic. Branching out from CPP to other related businesses and individuals revealed more of the same. The associated businesses/individuals often use logos/imagery/speech associated with pedophilia.

Comet Ping Pong =&gt; Owned by James Alefantis. James\' personal and business social media accounts were replete with creepy images and comments.
They host events frequently and they are all all-ages events. The artists that perform have similarly questionable art work/themes =&gt; <a href="https://archive.is/4190H">https://archive.is/4190H</a>
CPP also has hidden washrooms which may be used to facilitate child sexual abuse or trafficking.

           They are going to bait you into useless arguments (call em when you spot em!) to make you repeat yourself. If someone is arguing with you about a point you already made before - it's a diversion.

           You know how kind, normal human beings act, right? Well, call the obvious bullshit. We don't dissent. We
hear all sides. We encourage discussion and more research - we never ever attack information seekers. 
We never, ever dissent discussion.

           The purpose of all this digging is to uncover networks involved in the trafficking, sexual exploitation and ritual abuse of children.
A few days before the election Spirit Cooking dropped =&gt;

           Basically these idiots participate in creepy pseudo occult rituals. They do stuff ranging from dumping fake blood on efiggies of children, cut their hands open, mix blood and semen, probably drinking it, and engage in fake cannibalism. We speculate that they probably do these things for reals in other contexts.
John and Tony Podesta, the Molesta brothers look like the suspects in Maddy McCann's kidnapping (Murder)
In addition to exactly matching the description of the suspects John's emails which correspond to the time period relevant to the kidnapping were deleted, probably years before the Podesta leak occurred.
          </p>
          <p>
           They have homes filled with creepy art, some of which is pedophilic in nature. Many of their leaked emails are cryptic and include pedophilic symbolism. Some are quite blatant, for example this email discussing swimming children as entertainment:
           <a href="https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/49435">
            https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/49435
           </a>
          </p>
          <p>
           The Clinton's, the Podesta's and the Democrats were tied to Comet Ping Pong a "family friendly" pizza joint in Washington D.C. Upon inspection it was discovered that CPP was creepy as fuck: much associated with them is cryptic, sexual and pedophilic. Branching out from CPP to other related businesses and individuals revealed more of the same. The associated businesses/individuals often use logos/imagery/speech associated with pedophilia.

They host events frequently and they are all all-ages events. The artists that perform have similarly questionable art work/themes =&gt;
