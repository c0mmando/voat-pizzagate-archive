            Daily lurker since Nov 2016 - registered today because I had this problem over 6 mos ago...all of a sudden one day my trusty google search showed NOTHING pizza/Voat related.  I found out that if you go through Bing, type “Pizzagate Voat”, it’ll pop right up.  And from then on, it saves your last search in the history, so it makes it super easy.  Not a fan of Bing for other things, but it works for this!

            This 'scrubbing' of information has actually been going on for quite some time, although the scope has seemingly intensified in recent years.
           </p>
           <p>
            An alternative search engine - Cuildotcom - was effectively kneecapped shortly after being introduced a few years back.
One notable feature of this engine was that it did NOT track user's IPs.

           <p>
            Hmmmm ...
           </p>
           <p>
            Anyway, please do not stop in your/our collective efforts to shine light on these abominations.
           </p>
           <p>
            We are definitely winning, but our adversaries are resourceful, ruthless and - seemingly - increasingly desperate.

            My comrade, this war is being led for many years. Pizzagate was culmination point and it won't be forgotten easily. From the very beginning I've got the internet I was researching everything I could and spreading words of truth. What happened with Pizzagate was truly a breaking point and it has proved every "conspiracy theory" from the past.

             I only use DDG. Key word searches taken directly from an article is another work-around. THEY HEAVILY CENSOR ANYTHING VACCINE RELATED. Keeping an eye on what they censor reveals what is important to the ECONOMICS of the NWO.

            They are already trying to place government oversight on zuck. Sure they may claim for our benefit/protection but it is most likely a further attempt by alphabet agencies to farm more meta data.

            As you have stated they already control Google and have acceas to the main thoroughfare of information control. As Intel and AMD create builtin backdoors for all future systems the panopticon is almost complete.

            With the information provided by "The Lobby" we know Facebook is already in bed with Isreal with regards to their counter daemons flagging any groups posts or events within seconds of posting on a worldwide scale the chances of anyone or organization stopping 1984 from becoming reality is nil

             Facebook and Google were deep state created, and actually carry out work for the govt. A founding director of facebook was an "ex" CIA Director. You can find videos on Youtube where various people talk about how they are suing facebook for having had their competing project shut down to make facebook succeed.
            </p>
            <p>
             Facebook, Google, MSoft, Oracle, Amazon, Apple... all have deep state roots. Leaving them "unregulated" and pretending they are independent private companies, not extensions of military intelligence, is to offer an excuse to let them do things the government could not get away with. Facebook is quite simply a CIA project. Could it get away with the social engineering it does if it admitted it was part of the state? No. Hence the pretense of being a "private" and independent company continues for all those entities.
