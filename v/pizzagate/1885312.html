<p>I KNOW THAT SETH RICH WAS INVOLVED IN THE DNC LEAK.
I know this because in late 2014 a person contacted me about helping me to start a branch of the Internet Party in the United States. He called himself Panda. I now know that Panda was Seth Rich.</p>
<p>Panda advised me that he was working on voter analytics tools and other technologies that the Internet Party may find helpful.</p>
<p>I communicated with Panda on a number of topics including corruption and the influence of corporate money in politics.</p>
<p>“He wanted to change that from the inside.”
I was referring to what I knew when I did an interview with Bloomberg in New Zealand in May 2015. In that interview I hinted that Julian Assange and Wikileaks would release information about Hillary Clinton in the upcoming election.</p>
<p>The Rich family has reached out to me to ask that I be sensitive to their loss in my public comments. That request is entirely reasonable.</p>
<p>I have consulted with my lawyers. I accept that my full statement should be provided to the authorities and I am prepared to do that so that there can be a full investigation. My lawyers will speak with the authorities regarding the proper process.</p>
<p>If my evidence is required to be given in the United States I would be prepared to do so if appropriate arrangements are made. I would need a guarantee from Special Counsel Mueller, on behalf of the United States, of safe passage from New Zealand to the United States and back. In the coming days we will be communicating with the appropriate authorities to make the necessary arrangements. In the meantime, I will make no further comment.

<p>This relates to pizzagate as the same MSM news outlets that defame Pizzagate with &quot;Fake news&quot; and &quot;debunked conspiracy theories&quot; are in jeopardy of having their narrative questioned by their viewers.  If Kim Dotcom provides the hard evidence needed to show the DNC is implicated in Seth Rich\'s murder we will be able to beg the questions laid out by the contributors investigating pizzagate.</p>',

              v/sethrich

             .  This post was intended to enunciate how the same tactics are being deployed in regards to the Seth Rich case as it had been with the Pizzagate case.  I do see your point about the over load on Rich yet also see how if the DNC leaks came from him, then one must understand that it is related.  This all started because of Wikileaks emails.

             we appreciate your direction here, without it we wouldn't have such a profound insight into what specific details scare the shit out of y'all.  Kim Dotcom is about to piss on your party.

               Lose your time here?  Why are you here?  To call people stupid, deluded, insane, irrational?   That really is a waste of time.  The majority of us believe your here trying to protect something.  If your here to protect some innocent individuals.  Be more clear.  Use logic and rational to refute claims, or is that too hard for you.  Really never seen any of your posts displaying critical thinking to 'debunk'.  You are more like a comedian here.  Or more like a cheerleader, this is realized by many through your routine defamation posts.  It is my belief and many others that you are scared and show up nearly every day here to post blasphemy.  If I am mistaken and you have actually presented a logical progression on ANY post that discredits claims in that post I would be interested in seeing it.  Otherwise keep cheering us on!
