            Yes, I think that Gloria Steinem revealed that she was with the CIA at one point.  I also think she started the Women's Movement to get women out of the home and to work.  This would leave kids unattended.  This occurred to me when she outed herself. I think when things are exposed, many people will be shocked at who is all involved.  I may be surprised by a few, but no one will shock me anymore.  I have opened my eyes to so much.  I had such an admiration for Jimmy Carter, now I am not so sure.  I am not ready to throw him under the bus, but have no concreted reason.  I remembered how he had brain cancer at the age of 90.  Magically they discovered that some new procedure quickly rescued him.  He is now like he had a transfusion.  What other 90 yr. old have you heard of that beat brain cancer at that age?  I say since they can create cancers, and have a heart attack gun, then why can't they already cure them for themselves.  Not for us of course.  I have long felt cancer was cured many years ago.  Same with breast cancer.

            Are they possibly running something similar to what Sandusky was doing and running at Penn State?  Wow, if that is true, their minds are constantly coming up with new ways to continue their disgusting business.

            Well, there are a lot of kids that have been abused by family relatives and friends.  I looked up Prosperi and I could not find much about him, but I now get that Imo's covers  a large, very large area.  It kind of has tentacles, just like this whole mess.  I wonder if Imo's is not part of the global CP and child sex ring.  Devlin worked for them for 25 years and I do not think that he went all that time with his sex perverted pleasures and then one day he decided to pounce.  I think when he made the big jump to kidnap, that his boss Prosperi knew that it would be a matter of time before he was discovered, and their cover might be blown.  So he outed Devlin.  That is just my crazy theory.  Wolftrail also reminded me about Pi Pizza being Obama's favorite Pizza Place.  These places could all be part of the global ring of Hastert and Sandusky, imo.

            This stuff is far reaching.  I will try to look into the Devlin case today.  There are so many things that are connected to this horrible mess in St. Louis.  It seems to have no end.

            God, I hate Hastert.  What is wrong with this country that we do not get out into the streets and demand stricter laws against these people that vilify and defile our children?  He is a Devil and so is Sandusky and I believe that they and others like them deserve a special place in hell.  I would love to make the rest of their time here, a living hell.  What is the OneSTL.org region? I will look it up.  I also have read of people saying that Racine is a hell hole of iniquity as well.  You can bet that they knew Paul Ryan and Preibus when they were younger.  These sick perverts did their networking, you can be sure.  I agree that they are not only guilty of crimes in their own area but traveled elsewhere reeking their havoc where ever they went.  Like Hastert &amp; T. Podesta in Japan.

            Maybe instead of paying $25k for someone to debunk pizzagate, we should pay elite pedos $25k in bitcoin to anonymously spill the beans giving actionable evidence regarding pizzagate.

            I did not post the article to try for sympathy for him.  I did it to inform people that we had better start complaining and pressuring our lawmakers for this insanity to stop.  The Lobbyists for the Pedos and Lawyers are sure enough behind this.  I have tried to post about 3 articles today and have been deleted and now I must take backlash from members. Just trying to inform and do some good.
