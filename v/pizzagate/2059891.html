<p>Just in the last 10 mins I came across this gem. I didn\'t know the last 9 years the global satanic pedophile movement had their own social network in addition to the Satanic pedophilia on Facebook my father was prosecuted for commenting against on a causes petition against Facebook pedophilia. He was sued by a gay pedophilia normalization activist <a href="http://twitter.com/garryburnsblog">http://twitter.com/garryburnsblog</a> and the court of child sex love aka <a href="http://twitter.com/nodiscrim">http://twitter.com/nodiscrim</a> &amp; <a href="http://twitter.com/NCATNSW">http://twitter.com/NCATNSW</a> i.e. the NSW Government of Australia. </p>
<p>Hate speech against those who rape babies is here from my father: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140722080525/https://www.causes.com/posts/891061">https://web.archive.org/web/20140722080525/https://www.causes.com/posts/891061</a> (on an anti-pedo-social-network petition)</p>
<p>That same link minus the archive.org (see the embedded video above that auto-plays the judge says doesn\'t auto play) is in my father\'s case law:
<a href="https://www.caselaw.nsw.gov.au/decision/58b7789fe4b058596cba49b5">https://www.caselaw.nsw.gov.au/decision/58b7789fe4b058596cba49b5</a>
More info on that before I get back on topic: <a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/2053567">https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/2053567</a> <a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/2029702">https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/2029702</a> <a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/2056942/10145520">https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/2056942/10145520</a></p>
<p>So I found this video from a great site who\'s membership include a bunch of EX OTO pedo cult satanists who have run to god to absolve their sins, and here they are talking about the OTO\'s annual child rape feast in this video:</p>
<p><strong>ABSOLUTELY MUST WATCH</strong></p>

           <p>
            Early life
           </p>
           <p>
            Steven Paul Smith was born at the Clarkson Hospital in Omaha, Nebraska, the only child of Gary Smith, a student at the University of Nebraska Medical Center, and Bunny Kay Berryman, an elementary school music teacher. His parents divorced when he was six months old, and Smith moved with his mother to Duncanville, Texas. Smith later had a tattoo of a map of Texas drawn on his upper arm and said: "I didn't get it because I like Texas, kind of the opposite. But I won't forget about it, although I'm tempted to because I don't like it there."[10]
           </p>
           <p>
            Smith endured a difficult childhood[11] and a troubled relationship with his stepfather Charlie Welch.[12] Smith stated he may have been sexually abused by Welch at a young age, an allegation which Welch has denied.[11][13] He wrote about this part of his life in "Some Song": "How they beat you up week after week, and when you grow up you're going to be a freak."[14] The name "Charlie" also appears in songs "Flowers for Charlie" and "No Confidence Man." In a 2004 interview, Jennifer Chiba, Smith's partner at the time of his death, said that Smith's difficult childhood was partly why he needed to sedate himself with drugs as an adult: "He was remembering traumatic things from his childhood – parts of things. It's not my place to say what."[11]
           </p>
           <p>
            For much of his childhood, Smith's family was a part of the Community of Christ[15] but began attending services at a local Methodist Church. Smith felt that going to church did little for him, except make him "really scared of Hell".[15] In 2001, he said: "I don't necessarily buy into any officially structured version of spirituality. But I have my own version of it."[16]
           </p>
           <p>
            Smith began playing piano at age nine, and at ten began learning guitar on a small acoustic guitar bought for him by his father.[17] At this age he composed an original piano piece, "Fantasy", which won him a prize at an arts festival.[16] Many of the people on his mother's side of the family were non-professional musicians; his grandfather was a Dixieland drummer, and his grandmother sang in a glee club.[16]

Smith graduated from Lincoln High School in Portland, Oregon.
           </p>
           <p>
            At fourteen, Smith left his mother's home in Texas and moved to Portland, Oregon to live with his father, then working as a psychiatrist. It was around this time that Smith began using drugs, including alcohol, with friends. He also began experimenting with recording for the first time after borrowing a four-track recorder.[16] At high school, Smith played clarinet in the school band and played guitar and piano; he also sang in the bands Stranger Than Fiction[12] and A Murder of Crows,[18] billed as either Steven Smith or "Johnny Panic".[19] He graduated from Lincoln High School as a National Merit Scholar.[20]
           </p>
           <p>
            After graduation, Smith began calling himself "Elliott", saying that he thought "Steve" sounded too much like a "jock" name, and that "Steven" sounded "too bookish".[20] According to friends, he had also used the pseudonym "Elliott Stillwater-Rotter" during his time in the band A Murder of Crows.[21] Biographer S. R. Shutt speculates that the name was either inspired by Elliott Avenue, a street that Smith had lived on in Portland, or that it was suggested by his then-girlfriend. A junior high acquaintance of Smith speculates Smith changed his name so as not to be confused with Steve Smith, the drummer of Journey.[22]

             But the star of the show is a cover of the previously unreleased "High Times," by former roommate Sean Croghan, whose angry guitar and angry voice reflect the feelings shared by everyone Smith had affected: the sadness for the promise lost with his friend's early death.

            What most don't comprehend and will probably deny and call me a shill, is that there are 2 factions of the so called "illuminati". There are the Black Brotherhood, who are for pedophilia, death, and war. Then there is the Great White Brotherhood, these are the ones for liberty and good. The Black Brothers would be the "satanists", those involved with the Church of Satan or Temple of Set type groups. Black magicians, or moral relativists. The Great White Brotherhood would be the Freemasons, Hermetic Golden Dawn, Theosophical Society, Rosicrucians, and the Ordo Templi Orientis. Believe it or not, Aleister Crowley was a member of the Great White Brotherhood, despite claims he was evil. This was the Black Brothers trying to tarnish his name. Don't take my word for it, do REAL research yourselves. I know I would get huge amount of shit for this post, but the truth is the truth. Whether it lines up with your world view or not.

              Oh fuck we found another spooky Jimmy Commet instagram account. the guy is no pizza cook, just just a satanic artist that was calling him self a pizza cook since 2015. I didn't go looking for satanic pizza cooks I started investigating the OTO. I was right - I kept saying OTO is Pizzagate , Pizzagate is OTO.... and the more I dig the OTO the more connections I find to pizzagate and visa versa. There is something going on here.. Also see the comments here:

            He disappears the torrents of child rape victims going to his house to get of fchild rape charges. The perk of being the main DNC operative in that state. First case in American legal history of a civil settlement attempted in a criminal trial - Terry Bean tried to say the boy arse he raped - the crime could be absolved by paying the mother $250k and submitting to an AIDS test.

            That girl went missing in texas and nothing to do with portland. Funny though - the kid turned up safe - just ran away with her 16 year old boyfriend.

            This pedo Sun Behind the Sun defending the OTO cult is also friends with Mark Passio's biggest fan I exposed last week "The Great Work" - a reference to crowley who admitted that much when confronted on gab.ai.
