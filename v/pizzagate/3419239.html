               I think that people still don't realize the symbiotic nature of the relationship between the royal family and the intelligence services, MI5 and MI6.

             Pedophiles love the company of other pedophiles. There is more than enough evidence that the House of Windsor is riddled with it. BBC is a state network , like our PBS. Covered for Saville for decades.

             The UK royals (and US politicians) are just like respectable, church-going US farm families. When you were old enough, you'd find out that your playmate's aunt was really her sister. And the two brothers living in a cabin way back in the woods and baking everyone's excellent wedding cakes on a wood stove weren't really brothers at all.
