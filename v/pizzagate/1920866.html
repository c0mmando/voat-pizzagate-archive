            There is no useful info in your post. Since I study Couche Tard's business expansions, I could have used some info, like who is the card processing provider? Couche Tard is one of the fastest growing franchises in North America and set to kill off 7-11 (which is not sleek or fresh anymore). And BTW the reason why the CBS eye is on all the advertising platforms of the local bus companies is that Viacom is huge and they decided to call their outdoor advertising company CBS (it's the biggest ad network they have) But they have renamed it to Outfrontmedia and dropped the eye logo. And you can expect for all the bits and pieces of Viacom to change a lot since Sumner Redstone (majority owner) has been at the center of controversies and infighting among his family, wives, and mistresses since his Alzheimer's got worse a few years ago.

             Well, I can't find a picture of the debit/credit card when it's idle when waiting for the insert card message to appear. It's all I can say, the small boy love symbol is there at the top right corner of the idle Welcome/Bonjour screen.

              Thanks User2060. Normally, as I remember, the payment processor of most Quebec companies is Moneris. Their logo is a spiral. But, in past years other payment processors have made headway in the market. If you can get me a payment processor company name, I can use my contacts to get UI screenshots. Or they could also be on their corporate website or sales packages.

               The details I've given about the powder blue screen, not having to press a button other than for you PIN and the button under Okay or cancel, also, they seemed much more complicated than the typical ones where there is a yellow button to correct your PIN Number in case you make a mistake. There was okay to the right and cancel to the left when the price transaction shows up, and when that screen showed up, the Baby lover circle showed up at the upper left, maybe there was something written under it, not sure, it might have been swirling the other side though. I haven't gone back, since I stopped smoking 3 year and a half ago, I only ever go to that Couche-Tard for the cheese Taquitos since they became even more 7-11 like, with the hot-dogs, hamburgers, taquitos, pogos (hot-dogs on sticks) and nachos dispenser where they used to have a rack for stuff that they moved elsewhere in the store once that showed up. It's cheaper than going to a fast food restaurant and here up north here, we got a lot of them, all on the same boulevard, and most people have no idea what a Taquitos is, even most supermarkets will have frozen taquitos in the aisles, but not here. Personally I only love their taquitos, hot-dogs are not beef only sausages...not that I wanna eat kosher but beef sausages or I'm not eating mixed residue of turkey and pig carcass put on together.

               Oh and you have to press the touch screen to select Chequing or Savings account.

               Well, this is the first time I see this particular card reader, you had to use your digit on the screen to pick chequing or savings account too, which is the only time I've ever done this, pharmacy, groceries, another local smaller convenience store chain that's only in my area of Quebec, taxis since they have card devices, finally, only been a year and a half since they do here, one pizzeria that's kind Quebec's Dominos, although we have Domino's, but only in Montreal...maybe in Gatineau, I don't know, Gatineau to me is just the french part of Ottawa, I don't like going there, pubs are filled with 18 year old Ontarians who drive over the bridge for the booze and ignore everyone else even if they speak french, in Ontario, especially in northeast ontario, they have French classes starting 3rd grade until high school. Anyway, this is the first time I've seen this interface.
