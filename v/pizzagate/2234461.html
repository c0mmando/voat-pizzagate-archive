<hr />
<p>Ahem! Good morning everyone, Happy Friday!</p>
<p>Welcome to Thread 3, in which we ask, how can we share our knowledge to assist The Storm which is now evidently brewing? Could Q have been teaching us a system, and how could the The Socratic Method help us in the days ahead? </p>
<p>As we share knowledge, would any pol/acks here be willing to post info in the comments? Would anyone with news be willing to share it for us in the comments? If so, thank you!</p>

<p><strong>RESEARCH</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Shall we dig? Lots of search results under \'Bin Talal John Podesta\'. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How would you feel if you knew that Bin Talal controls Citibank, Twitter, News Corp, Lyft, Coca-Cola, Pepsi Co Inc, McDonald`s Corp, Apple Computer Inc., Motorola, AOL Time Warner, Saks Inc., EuroDisney, Walt Disney Company, and…. … BARACK OBAMA? - <a href="https://americantruthseekers.com/need-to-know-arrested-saudi-prince-owns-america/">https://americantruthseekers.com/need-to-know-arrested-saudi-prince-owns-america/</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>As Bin Talal is the largest shareholder in Twitter, how would a thread documenting all our research into conservative politics, PG, the Cabal and the censorship of it all by Twitter, be useful? On 2016-11-21 Twitter, banned users for exposing CP linked accounts. Does anyone have research? (MollyGate)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In 2002, Al-Waleed Bin Talal donated $500,000 to help fund the George Herbert Walker Bush scholarship at Phillips Academy in Andover, Massachusetts. How could more research, or a thread on Talal and GWB benefit us just now? - <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al-Waleed_bin_Talal">https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al-Waleed_bin_Talal</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>From MegaAnon - &quot;Y’all, if you don’t bring these questions all the way back to Bush and 9/11, you’re gonna miss the boat on this. Same Saudi’s arrested right now are the same ones who watched 9/11 happen, then got a few POTUS approved Raytheon Boeing TIA flights secretly secured, out of the country. Same Raytheon Boeing extracted a bunch of Saudi’s out of Vegas via McCarran, after the attack.&quot;  - <a href="http://boards.4chan.org/pol/thread/148304340#p148304996">http://boards.4chan.org/pol/thread/148304340#p148304996</a>  (can we track these flights anywhere?)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What would you think, knowing what we now know, that Bin Talal owns the majority of The Four Seasons hotel group, King George V in Paris and The Savoy in London? What may go on in this huge network? How could Bin Talal\'s business interests &amp; hotel research be useful just now? </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How could research into how Bin Talal and the Saudi Princes connect with everything we\'ve been researching in PG and the Cabal, benefit our cause?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How would finding proofs that the CPP block is owned by Bin Talal be good for PG? Would anyone like to do a breakdown of previous research?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Is it possible that SA is involved in child, sex and human trafficking? If so, could the following be a resource for memes n tweets? - <a href="https://themuslimissue.wordpress.com/2016/09/26/saudi-royals-child-sex-slave-trade/">https://themuslimissue.wordpress.com/2016/09/26/saudi-royals-child-sex-slave-trade/</a> &amp; <a href="http://www.cifiaonline.com/saudisexslavetrade.htm">http://www.cifiaonline.com/saudisexslavetrade.htm</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Would it benefit PG if we learned about Saudi Child Sex Abuse and Trafficking and links to US? - <a href="https://cathyfox.wordpress.com/2017/01/14/saudi-child-sex-abuse-and-trafficking-and-links-to-us">https://cathyfox.wordpress.com/2017/01/14/saudi-child-sex-abuse-and-trafficking-and-links-to-us</a></p>

<p>Do you have any info on the princes who were arrested? All names here - <a href="https://imgtc.com/U18sTAT">https://imgtc.com/U18sTAT</a></p>

<li>
<p>Knowing what we now know, how would digging into Bin Talal\'s company help us? -  <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingdom_Holding_Company">https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingdom_Holding_Company</a></p>
</li>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Comet Ping Pong FINALLY under investigation. Is this connected to SA and The Storm? Could SA have been the great power behind? Are they exposed now? Video from Titus Frost - <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjItGTMYArM">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjItGTMYArM</a></p>

<li>
<p>Helpers at /pol are saying we have a small window to soften up the masses with baby-pills about what\'s about to happen. As said a hundred times here, people will need our help to get through this. Our attitudes will make a difference. Let\'s have compassion, pray, and do our best.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Has the second great meme war has commenced? Memes are starting to appear across all social media. Please do all that you possibly can. Q and friends are saying <strong>you are the media now</strong>. Can we change the world now? Hashtags: CalmBeforeTheStorm . TheStorm . FollowTheWhiteRabbit</p>

<p>In /pol Thurs night the threads were being shilled so, so, so hard that we couldn\'t talk. Q and helpers were in there, and anons were imploring them to use an id system, so we could discern their posts from others posing as Q. Early Fri am, Q appeared again and posted using a unique ID (tripcode). Whether this is Q or not, we don\'t know, however you can decide from the latest posts above, yourself, and moving forward with other posts using the same ID. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Appears from the new posts that Q is passing in code that the [C]IA are out and the N[S]A are taking care of ops. Posts that include +++ messes with [A]I, so using that in our posts means we don\'t get inundated with bot shillage.</p>

<p><strong>The Socratic Method - &quot;Socrates engaged in questioning of his students in an unending search for truth. He sought to get to the foundations of his students\' and colleagues\' views by asking continual questions until a contradiction was exposed, thus proving the fallacy of the initial assumption. This became known as the Socratic Method, and may be Socrates\' most enduring contribution to philosophy.&quot;</strong> - <a href="https://www.law.uchicago.edu/socratic-method">https://www.law.uchicago.edu/socratic-method</a></p>

<p>New reminder from Q - &quot;Re-review graphic (in full) each day post news release. Learn to distinguish between relevant/non relevant news. Disinformation is real. Disinformation is nescessary.&quot;</p>
<p>Reminder from Q - &quot;When big news drops, read the entire graphic. This is so critical and why some topics are continually emphasized more than others as those will be the recent happenings.&quot;</p>',

             As Bin Talal is the largest shareholder in Twitter, how would a thread documenting all our research into conservative politics, PG, the Cabal and the censorship of it all by Twitter, be useful? On 2016-11-21 Twitter, banned users for exposing CP linked accounts. Does anyone have research? (MollyGate)

             In 2002, Al-Waleed Bin Talal donated $500,000 to help fund the George Herbert Walker Bush scholarship at Phillips Academy in Andover, Massachusetts. How could more research, or a thread on Talal and GWB benefit us just now? -

             From MegaAnon - "Y’all, if you don’t bring these questions all the way back to Bush and 9/11, you’re gonna miss the boat on this. Same Saudi’s arrested right now are the same ones who watched 9/11 happen, then got a few POTUS approved Raytheon Boeing TIA flights secretly secured, out of the country. Same Raytheon Boeing extracted a bunch of Saudi’s out of Vegas via McCarran, after the attack."  -

Early Fri am, Q appeared again and posted using a unique ID (tripcode). Whether this is Q or not, we don't know, however you can decide from the latest posts above, yourself, and moving forward with other posts using the same ID.

            It's incredible what we have learned from John Podesta. Imagine being the dumb kike that almost single handedly brings down the NWO on accident.

            The CBTS Threads has become quite the cluster fuck! It  is being hit hard by Libs bots, shills, larps &amp; Soros pd whores!( To be expected).
           </p>
           <p>
            There is currently three CBTS #336 threads, none showing up on first page.
           </p>
           <p>
            Q is posting at times with TCodes, sometimes not which is leading to confusion.
           </p>
           <p>
            If anyone has time or the nerves to go take a crack at the Q clues, they do need some legit posters to help stear the CBTS threads.

                <p>
                 Edward Joseph Snowden (born June 21, 1983) is an American computer professional, former Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) employee, and former contractor for the United States government who copied and leaked classified information from the National Security Agency (NSA) in 2013 without authorization. His disclosures revealed numerous global surveillance programs, many run by the NSA and the Five Eyes Intelligence Alliance with the cooperation of telecommunication companies and European governments.
                </p>
                <blockquote>
                 <p>
                  In 2013, Snowden was hired by an NSA contractor,
                  <strong>
                   Booz Allen Hamilton
                  </strong>
                  , after previous employment with Dell and the CIA.[1] On May 20, 2013, Snowden flew to Hong Kong after leaving his job at an NSA facility in Hawaii, and in early June he revealed thousands of classified NSA documents to journalists Glenn Greenwald, Laura Poitras, and Ewen MacAskill.

                 Booz Allen Hamilton Inc. (/ˈbuːz ˈælən ˈhæməltən/,[3] informally: Booz Allen[4]) is an American management consulting firm, sometimes referred to as a government-services company,[5] headquartered in McLean, Virginia,[6] in Greater Washington, D.C., with 80 other offices around the globe.
                </p>
                <p>
                 After graduating from Northwestern University in Evanston, Illinois in 1914, Edwin G. Booz founded Edwin G. Booz Surveys
                </p>
                <p>
                 A June 28, 2007 article in The Washington Post related how a United States Department of Homeland Security contract with Booz Allen increased from $2 million to more than $70 million through two no-bid contracts, one occurring after the DHS's legal office had advised DHS not to continue the contract until after a review. A Government Accountability Office (GAO) report on the contract characterized it as not well-planned and lacking any measure for assuring valuable work to be completed.
                </p>
                <p>
                 On July 11, 2011[19][20] the group Anonymous, as part of its Operation AntiSec,[21] hacked into Booz Allen servers, extracting e-mails and non-salted passwords from the U.S. military. This information and a complete dump of the database were placed in a file shared on The Pirate Bay.[22] Despite Anonymous' claims that 90,000 emails were released, the Associated Press counted only 67,000 unique emails, of which only 53,000 were military addresses. The remainder of the addresses came from educational institutions and defense contractors.[23] Anonymous also said that it accessed four gigabytes of Booz Allen source code and deleted those four gigabytes. According to a statement by the group, "We infiltrated a server on their network that basically had no security measures in place."[24][25]

                <blockquote>
                 <p>
                  Anonymous accused Booz Allen of working with HBGary Federal by creating a project for the manipulation of social media. Anonymous also accused Booz Allen of participating in intelligence-gathering and surveillance programs of the U.S. federal government and, as stated by Kukil Bora of the International Business Times, "possible illegal activities."[21] Booz Allen confirmed the intrusion on 13 July, but contradicted Anonymous' claims in saying that the attack never got past their own systems, meaning that information from the military should be secure.[26] In August of that year, during a conference call with analysts, Ralph Shrader, the chairman and CEO, stated that "the cost of remediation and other activities directly associated with the attack" were not expected to have a "material effect on our financial results."[27]

                <p>
                 In 2013 David Sirota of Salon said that Booz Allen and parent company
                 <strong>
                  The Carlyle Group
                 </strong>
                 make significant political contributions to the Democratic Party and the Republican Party as well as individual politicians, including Barack Obama and John McCain.[35]
                </p>
                <p>
                 According to Maplight, a company that tracked campaign donations, Booz Allen gave a total of just over $87,000 to U.S. lawmakers from 2007 to June 2013.[36] Sirota concluded that "many of the politicians now publicly defending the surveillance state and slamming whistleblowers like Snowden have taken huge sums of money from these two firms", referring to Booz Allen and Carlyle, and that the political parties are "bankrolled by these firms."[35]

                 <p>
                  In June 2012 Booz Allen expanded its operations in North Africa and the Middle East, with initial plans to add operations in Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, United Arab Emirates. It planned to later add operations to Bahrain, Saudi Arabia, and Turkey, during a time when those countries, as stated by Jill R. Aitoro of the Washington Business Journal, were "recover[ing] from the turmoil associated with the Arab Spring."[37]
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  The Booz Allen employee base, when it was a part of Booz &amp; Company, had long-term relationships with many North African and Middle Eastern countries; Booz Allen had split from Booz &amp; Company[37] David Sirota of Salon said that politicians in the United States who received financing from Booz Allen and "other firms with a similar multinational business model" have vested interests in "denigrating the democratic protest movements that challenge Mideast surveillance states that make those donors big money, too."[35]
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  Booz Allen helped the Government of the United Arab Emirates create an equivalent of the National Security Agency for that country. According to David E. Sanger and Nicole Perlroth of The New York Times, "one Arab official familiar with the effort" said that "They are teaching everything. Data mining, Web surveillance, all sorts of digital intelligence collection."[38] In 2013 Sanger and Perlroth said that the company "profits handsomely from its worldwide expansion".[38]

              Pay attention to what's coming out today about Don Jr. and Assanges communication. If you've read any of my posts made in May or July, specifically the Seth Rich ones and the Assange dump ones and what he's sitting on, note what I said in detail about the Rohrabacher meetings and timeframes, in comparison to the timelines of the Don Jr. communications. Then, note that Dianne Feinstein requested the release of all of Assange's twitter DM messages from Twitter directly, right before Rohrabacher was named in probe earlier last week.

             The writer is presenting conclusions instead of evidence. They don't take the time to clean up their own writing and make it look presentable, which raises the question of how much effort they put into verifying their information. That said, weirdos have their fans and their fans are weird enough to leak insider info to them. Here is a tl;dr summary of what they are claiming.

              He's a writer who claims to be in with a branch of Yakuza called the White Dragon Society.

            I think Therapist on 4 chan cracked the 4-10-20 code.  The 4th book of the Bible (New Testament), 10th chapter, 20th verse.  This seems entirely reasonable as Q often quotes from the Bible.  The verse says, "Many of them were saying, "He has a demon and is insane. Why do you listen to Him?"

            I was looking deeper into the short film
            <em>
             Automatic at Sea
            </em>
            . Produced by Alefantis and directed by Matthew Lessner, the synopsis describes a film about a young girl who gets trapped on a mysterious island and "secret pizza" is involved. Or at least that's what their Kickstarter page describes and this can be seen by the screenshot I took here
            <a href="https://imgur.com/lVIGkGl">
             https://imgur.com/lVIGkGl
            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            However, when I went onto their IMDB page I noticed that the synopsis had been reworded and "pizza" is replaced with "soda." This can be seen in this image
            <a href="https://imgur.com/Ga4v9yv">
             https://imgur.com/Ga4v9yv
            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            I haven't seen the entire film but I watched the trailer and captured this interesting scene
            <a href="https://imgur.com/ozfR53d">
             https://imgur.com/ozfR53d
            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            Interesting. Also interesting is what I found below the synopsis on the same Kickstarter for the film and is a statement from Lessner
            <a href="https://imgur.com/kv8rYv6">

            What is he trying to say here and what does he mean when he says "...why can't I stop thinking about Crystal Pepsi?" Is Crystal Pepsi more code?

              In 2002, Al-Waleed Bin Talal donated $500,000 to help fund the George Herbert Walker Bush scholarship at Phillips Academy in Andover, Massachusetts. Would more research, or a thread on Talal and GWB benefit us just now? -

Same Raytheon Boeing extracted a bunch of Saudi’s out of Vegas via McCarran, after the attack."  -

            , thank you, thank you, thank you, man.  My real life has stolen me from the computer but I've managed to check in once or twice a night to see what's up.  Wow, I cannot thank you enough for keeping us posted.  I understand that on November 11, 2017, (yesterday) at 5:57 p.m., Roseann Barr posted an interesting tweet stating,
            <strong>
             "lots of ppl will become Woke AF this week."
            </strong>
            Here is a link to the tweet, which is so cool:  ttps://twitter.com/therealroseanne/status/929483266054221824 .
           </p>
           <p>
            So the country's waiting and curious, and I, for one, thank God that you,

              !  Trust me, my whole family and I are praying daily, out loud, early, and often.  I would love nothing more than to get the ole USA back in the hands of us good guys, in my lifetime, like all of you good guys here.  Work has gotten very busy over the past week, especially, but l am taking a little break today to catch up on a few things, so I made time to catch up here, too.

I should be able to do some digging and post at 4chan again this upcoming week.  I love how Roseanne Barr just posted that a lot of people are gonna get woke AF real soon.  God bless you all -- well, all y'all good guys, that is.  On second thought, God bless all the bad guys, too, cuz maybe that will turn them from their evil ways. . . .  Take care and TTYS.

            STILL MORE Q
The biggest smallest secret you never knew. Spirit Cooking
This is a total shit story. I'm not kidding.
           </p>
           <p>
            Here's what you do not know. It's small. It's tiny. It's everywhere. And it is mostly you.
           </p>
           <p>
            You are mostly microbial. The statistics change this due to obesity which alters the majority of microbial, but, do know this--microbes are ruling things. And you are a thing.
           </p>
           <p>
            They are also patentable, per the Supreme Court, they can be as long as part of them are bioengineered.
           </p>
           <p>
            BUT, this is not the smallest secret.
           </p>
           <p>
            This is:
           </p>
           <p>
            There is this long lived belief that a fetus lives and grows and thrives in a sterile environment. Guess what. They do not.
           </p>
           <p>
            The fetus has within it a rich new microbial world which, well, makes the fountain of youth look like a raison in the sun.
           </p>
           <p>
            Here it is. Utilizing this new microbial frontier has caused those in the know to cure many typical human conditions. It's pretty sick. But they aren't physically sick--anymore. They get treatments. They recover or are on ongoing recoveries.
           </p>
           <p>
            And they even party about it. It's sort of why things are the way things are--and why you question and know in your gut--they have something going on.
           </p>
           <p>
            Put the pieces together. If you want, I'll bore you with research docs and links.
           </p>
           <p>
            Just think about who, why, where, what, when, and HOW.

            Summary:

           <ul>
            <li>
             Soros replaced a family 'y'.
            </li>
            <li>
             Hitler was a puppet.
            </li>
            <li>
             There is something in the family histories of Soros and Merkel.
            </li>
            <li>
             The Titanic and Hindenberg disasters were not accidents.
            </li>
            <li>
             "Snow White" reference "Confirmed" to be the CIA databases.

             New movie codes: Iron Eagle, Jason Bourne (CIA/Dream).
            </li>
           </ul>
           <p>
            I feel like this 100-year-old disaster stuff is a misdirection. Can anyone identify the family "y"?

            There is also a claim by DC Anon that the QAnon with the tripcode is a fake.

             Last night these threads were HIJACKED by multiple bad factions (some bots, some autists who are sick of us and want to see us banned, maybe the CIA, and a group trying to advertise their stuff).
            </p>
            <p>
             They started filling the main copypasta with dead links that did not pertain to our investigation, filling it with subtle changes, basically poisoning the bread.
            </p>
            <p>
             They also started to throw disinformation into the mix to try and derail.

           </p>
           <p>
            <em>
             Epstein island. 
What is a temple?
What occurs in a temple?
Worship?
Why is the temple on top of a mountain?
How many levels might exist below?
What is the significance of the colors, design and symbol above the dome? 
Why is this relevant?
Who are the puppet masters?
Have the puppet masters traveled to this island? 
When? How often? Why?

           <p>
            Q asked about the significance of the colors, shapes and design. 
If you search "Islamic mosques" or "Saudi Arabian temples" into your search engine, guess what you find? Similar-looking mosques with white and blue colors, sometimes in stripes, and a gold dome on top.
           </p>

            Could this temple at Epstein's island have been built specifically for his Islam-worshipping clients? Or, more specifically, for clients that were just taken out in the SA purge that occurred recently? 
We all know how some Saudi's in positions of power have a dereliction for children.
Q also points to a mountain and possible underground tunnels or "levels" existing below. Could Q be implying there is a system through which either clients or other unwilling participants arrive or leave on the island undetected?

             Great job finding the temple on Little St. James. The hurricanes did enormous damage to the Virgin Islands. Did the temple survive?

            I got this video from the man who filmed it while working as an Apple Certified Tech at a Beverly Hills business in 2012. The building, he said, is owned by an heir to the Hennessey fortune.
           </p>
           <p>
            He claims he went upstairs looking for a wire but found this large art piece sitting an otherwise empty floor. He was fairly stunned but thankfully luckily had the wherewithall to film as much as he could before a supervisor discovered him.

            I am aware of Luciferian occult practices, such as the blood over intent black magic they enjoy. However, there's so much going on in this painting that I'm missing too much. I don't recognize a lot of the faces either.

              The hybrid art of Einar and Jamex de la Torre

            <blockquote>

              Perhaps the centerpiece of the exhibition is the elaborate three-part altarpiece "La Reconquista," freely adapted from "The Last Judgment" by the celebrated Netherlandish painter Hans Memling. This was made using a lenticular process that gives the illusion of 3-D. The De la Torres replaced the religious figures with their own, in an updated parable of greed and power. The seated Christ in the central panel now wears the mask of Quetzalcoatl, a leading Aztec deity, while below him the Archangel Michael, weigher of souls, is played by the Spanish conquistador Hernando Cortés.
             </p>
             <p>
              The brothers chuckle as they point out the other characters. Cortés is weighing the worthiness souls on his scale, with a pious Ricky Martin on the side of the good who will go to heaven. Near him, emerging from the ground, are actors Antonio Banderas and Salma Hayek. On the left panel are the light-colored, fortunate ones going to heaven — New Mexico Gov. Bill Richardson plays St. Peter welcoming the "saved." The towered gates behind him are labeled "Bank of Amexica," and ready to enter are Carlos Slim, the wealthy telecommunications magnate, in a bikini top, and President Obama, with a cigarette in his mouth. The right panel features the unfortunate indigenous peoples, sentenced to hell and eternal punishment.

            What the hell is the Satanist sundial thing in the middle of Epstein island? I know we were directed to the temple (yes, a billionaire's private Island needs a temple if you are doing ritual Satanist sacrifices) but what is this thing in the middle of the island? I can't find a similar sundial anywhere online.....

            I have been checking around and some of this is starting to show up on independent news sites on the internet. Maybe even a teensy bit into mainstream press. This is going to work!  It is seeping up into the open and sunlight is the best sanitizer. I saw a lot of good political cartoons that are relevant. Does anyone know any cartoonists that have political leanings or people who work marketing advertisement, who would do some pro bono work on the memes. If this is as epic as it could be, wouldn't those same memes and/or cartoons be remembered like FOREVER in perpetuity? Or, at the very least make it into the National Archives? Try to redpill some of those people first.

             My theory just now is that GN may be conveying that Hollywood movies are all designed to be psychologically manipulative. Hollywood must die for liberty to be preserved.

             I think it's a genius in a Hollywood marketing company who is mixing in chatter about Marvel and Disney movies, including the new Thor movie in theaters now, with the currently popular QAnon style and the Don Trump Time Machine meme. It gets a guaranteed audience and gets people talking about the movies.

              That aside, there are at least two Hollywood angles that are at least tangentially swamp-related.

             <p>
              Lionsgate, which made the good Batman movies, was owned by Frank Giustra and had some business dealings with China's Dalian Wanda group. Dalian Wanda was in talks to buy them out but I don't think it ever went through. Giustra was a major donor to the Clinton Foundation.

               Giustra  served as chairman of Lions Gate Entertainment from 1997–2003.[13] He hoped to capitalize on the growing film industry in Vancouver. The company bought a number of small production facilities and distributors. Its first success was American Psycho, which began a trend of producing and distributing films far too controversial for the major American studios. Other successes included Affliction, Gods and Monsters, Dogma, and the Michael Moore documentary Fahrenheit 9/11, which turned out to be the studio's highest grossing film. In 2000, Giustra left the firm and it was taken over by Jon Feltheimer and Michael Burns. Giustra sold most of his stake in Lionsgate in 2003.
              </p>
              <p>
               In December 2010, Giustra returned to Lions Gate Entertainment as a member of the board of directors.[14] In March 2012, he started a new joint venture with Lionsgate and Thunderbird Films, called Sea to Sky Entertainment, which will focus on projects in the television industry.
              </p>
              <p>
               September 2014, Thunderbird Films, where Giustra is both a director and investor, purchased UK Soda Pictures Inc. In April 2013 Thunderbird Films, which has a partnership with Lionsgate to run a TV studio, purchased Reunion Pictures for an undisclosed sum to bolster its one-hour drama production capacity. The deal is Thunderbird's latest move to turn the distribution and rights management company into a major film and TV producer. Lionsgate founder Frank Giustra is a major shareholder who largely orchestrated the 50–50 joint venture Sea to Sky Entertainment with Lionsgate.

             The sealed indictment count may be up to 294 nationwide from 10/30 - 11/9.

            However, we do not know how many, if any of these are swamp-related. The largest numbers are in California (LA), New York, and Texas. Does anyone know how many sealed indictments are normal for these districts?

            Look at pics. of N.((( K military. It is (C)(G)(I )clones. Many look like the same people. It looks like people were in a photo shoot and slightly changed their expression or the same pic of a person was lightened or darkened and added many times in a pic.. This is what I believe is one of the things Que meant by N. Kay is fake. Here is an example but there are many. Lookup En Kay Pics on gooogal. Then make memes. Wake people to the walter dis-knee lies

             It is very probable that many of the weapons are fakes, but don't let that fool you into thinking that NK isn't a threat.  Kim is a spoiled, arrogant, evil dictator.  If he thinks that he can get away with Nuking the US and keep his own little butt safe he'll do it.

            So i've been a lonnngg time lurker of reddit.  Sometimes topics come up and other bullitin systems are cross referenced such as voat or 4chan.  I Chill pretty hard on the news and conspiracy sections.  This happening though has really caught my attention.  been reading about trump for a while...and honestly I really want to believe that there are people like him out there.  Looking out for the betterment of man kind.  The agencie, cabals, bloodlines, dynasties, etc..are all real to me.  I've felt first hand the results of their actions in minor and major ways through out my lifetime so far.  I am still skeptical he's not controlled though.  The whole obama/trump prayer tweet that seems to follow eachother kinda confused me.  Because if one or the other has control of the others account than who's to say that's really them in the first place?  But..looking at the update today in this thread I noticed something in the third bulletin picture of /pol.  There's no way this is a coincidence and maybe I'm missing something when they're reffering to a trip code.  But if you look at the letters and words surrounded by [ and ].  It clearly reads "CIA is here pray" as well as "CIA NSA" then in ( and ) it reads "sin full 1" &lt;--that one im not sure about.
           </p>
           <p>
            Did anyone else notice this?  has this been referenced anywhere?  If so..I worry that the simpsons will be right.  And if that is the case, than the deepstate couldnt be anymore dangerously real. Would they dare try?  If so they must be stopped.  Hopefully my messages doesn't get me harassed or killed. Because I want to believe so bad this is real.  That changes for the better are coming.  I'm tired of being victim/witness to the tyrannies of evil men/women.

9/11, The Crime Families, Donald Trump... WHY IS THIS RELEVANT? The TRUTH..
           </p>
           <p>
            The “winds of war” are blowing as the “Deep State” is now in complete terror after National Security Agency (NSA) forces loyal to President Donald Trump, and Saudi Arabian forces loyal to Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, have “rapidly shifted” from their “rampage bloodbath” destroying Hollywood and US mainstream media leftist elites, to their now targeting the coup-plotters behind the 9/11 attacks, and that Trump had vowed he was going to release, when, on February 16th, 2016, he said that if elected “you will find out who really knocked down the World Trade Center...it wasn't the Iraqis...you may find it's the Saudis”.
           </p>
           <p>
            As a mega real-estate developer of world-class iconic skyscrapers across the world , President Trump nearly immediately knew that the collapse of the World Trade Center buildings were caused by a controlled demolition implosion event, as no one of sane mind would ever believe that kerosene jet fuel could melt the massive concrete reinforced steel beams these types of buildings are constructed with. And in true Donald Trump style, began his chess match sixteen years ago and is being finished out as I type.
           </p>
           <p>
            To what the true cause of the 9/11 attacks were about, Trump KNEW (and everyone else but the American people) was a vile and sinister plot masterminded by the Bush Crime Family and the powerful Bin Laden Family (and aided by the Clinton Crime Family) in order to destroy the Middle East and Afghanistan in order to build pipelines to control the world’s flow of natural gas and oil, which I reported on in 2016, and that the International Criminal Court has just put under a “war crimes” and “crimes against humanity” investigation.
           </p>
           <p>
            To fully understand the magnitude of this sinister plot, you have to know the plot began in November, 1998, when former President George H.W. Bush, on behalf of the multinational private financial company named The Carlyle Group, traveled to Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, to meet with the Bin Laden Family, a meeting also attended by Singapore billionaire Leonard Glenn Francis, the owner of the international maritime company Glenn Marine Group.
           </p>
           <p>
            A final meeting between President Bush and the Bin Laden Family to “formalize” and “activate” the 9/11 plot, was held again in Jeddah, in January, 2000—where a “practice dry run” was approved, but with “certain parties” only agreeing to this vile attack if George W. Bush was elected president, which he was later confirmed that year when the US Supreme Court ordered Florida to stop counting votes, thus handing Bush his victory over Al Gore.
           </p>
           <p>
            Upon "W" becoming President in January 2000, the 9/11 plot accelerated with these murderous “actors” choosing their “bought and paid for” US Naval Intelligence “assets” to coordinate the attacks on the World Trade Centers and the US Capitol Building, and that Leonard Glenn Francis had so thoroughly corrupted, nearly every US Navy Admiral was under his control.
           </p>
           <p>
            These US Naval Intelligence "assets" in fearing that their Pentagon control center for the 9/11 attacks could possibly come under counterattack, ordered it to be massively reinforced, including its being fitted with blast-resistant windows 2 inches thick, weighing 2,500 pounds each, and whose work was completed in the early morning hours of September 11th, 2001.
           </p>
           <p>
            What was a day of "epic proportions " for every American, particularly New Yorkers, and the entire world, ar 9:00 a.m., on September 11, 2001, President George H.W. Bush, the entire Carlyle Group, and the Bin Laden Family, gathered together at the Ritz Carlton Hotel in Washington D.C. to celebrate what to them would be a victory, but to the rest of the world was one of the most horrific crimes against humanity ever committed, but whose vile plans were thwarted when a mysterious “Aurora Aircraft” took off from the equally mysterious Area 51 region of Nevada, flew at Mach 6 (6 times the speed of sound) towards Pennsylvania where it obliterated the plane intended to strike the US Capitol building, with it then streaking to the Pentagon where it fired a powerful cruise missile completely destroying the “secure counterattack” Office of Naval Intelligence Control Center instantly killing numerous US Naval Intelligence officers, after which the 9/11 attacks immediately ended.
           </p>
           <p>
            In the immediate aftermath of the 9/11 attacks, "W" quickly got out of America all of the Bin Laden family members attending what they believed would be their victory celebration at the Ritz Carlton Hotel, in Washington D.C., by having them flown to Texas from where they then left the US back to Saudi Arabia, and W stating afterwards “my dad was meeting with the brother of Osama on September 11, 2001, does that make him a terror suspect”—but whose “dad”, former President George H.W. Bush, nevertheless, cut all ties between his Carlyle Group and the Bin Laden Family six weeks later, on October 26, 2001.
           </p>
           <p>
            With the supposed “mastermind” of the 9/11 attacks, the former CIA operative Osama Bin Laden, became no more than afterthought.
           </p>
           <p>
            Also in the immediate aftermath of 9/11, a very now familiar man named US Marine General John Kelly formed an alliance with who is considered to be the most effective US military intelligence official in modern times, US Army General Michael Flynn, with both of them painstakingly rebuilding the entire US Naval Intelligence organization in their attempt to uncover the "true" facts of this horrific crime against America and our people.
           </p>
           <p>
            In a classic “follow the money” intelligence operation, General’s Kelly and Flynn began to uncover the massive corruption that had led the US Navy to becoming part of the 9/11 plot in the first place, but who were fiercely being fought by both the Bush and Obama regimes every step of the way, so much so that they then had to turn away from the US military and get aid from “loyal to their cause” FBI forces, all of whom were based in California, NOT Washington D.C.....and to now we know WHY the Bush family crossed their "party line" to support Hillary Clinton after their "beloved" Jeb was "knocked out" in a one-two punch by then candidate Donald Trump in the 2016 elect.
           </p>
           <p>
            Being aided by these FBI forces in California, General’s Kelly and Flynn (who were supported by loyal US military intelligence officials too) were able to secure a guilty plea from a lower-level 9/11 coup plotter, and US Naval Intelligence officer, named John Beliveau, on December 17, 2013, but with Beliveau being kept hidden from the Obama administration for nearly 3 years, until October 14, 2016, when he was brought into a US Federal Court and sentenced for his crimes.
           </p>
           <p>
            From the “seed” of US Naval Intelligence officer John Beliveau, General’s Kelly and Flynn were able to begin “growing the tree” to destroy this vile nest of 9/11 attack accomplices and that was greatly accelerated under the leadership of President Trump with his ordering, this past June, the first charges to be filed against these monsters under US military law—and who just hours ago, began targeting over 440 US Navy officials, including 60 of America's 221 Navy Admirals.
           </p>
           <p>
            At the exact same time that President Trump is moving against these US Naval Intelligence 9/11 plotters, so too are Saudi Arabian forces loyal to Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, who over the past 48 hours, have arrested nearly everyone of their citizens who attended the “victory celebration” with the Bush Crime Family at the Ritz Carlton Hotel, in Washington D.C., on September 11, 2001, to include Osama Bin Laden’s brothers Bakr Bin Laden and Shafiq Bin Laden, who I reported a few days ago, with the exceptions being Saudi Prince Mansour bin Muqrin and other top Saudi officials who were killed when their helicopter was shot down while they attempting to flee the country as reported two days ago, and Prince Abdul Aziz bin Fahd who died in a firefight with forces trying to arrest him.
           </p>
           <p>
            Now knowing that President Trump had timed with Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman PERFECTLY this attack against these 9/11 plotters to coincide with his being in Asia, and under the protection of loyal forces to keep him from being assassinated, the "Deep State” forces counterattacked by pushing the world to the brink of war by having their Iranian Obama allies begin firing missiles into Saudi Arabia, but that has not stopped the Saudis massive roundup of these heinous monsters whose numbers may soon reach into the hundreds, if not thousands.
           </p>
           <p>
            In conclusion, as this "behind-the-scenes" "Deep State" war continues, with the crime families of the Bush's, the Clintons, and now the Obamas who all formed an alliance to retain their power, and more importantly to keep their "dark" secrets and treasonous crimes against their own people hidden...murdering thousands, all to line their pockets and to remain the puppet masters of the US government....Donald Trump, like him or not, is literally putting his "life on the line"...to save all of us , and to wrestle Americans OUT of the control of these high stakes, evil driven crime families....forevermore.

             Fantastic post!  Here is something that will help paint more background into the picture of the collusion of Saudi faction of NWO with CIA US Deep state.  I say CIA because of Obama's mother, why else would he have been the "chosen" one by the Muslim Brotherhood and early Wahhabist infiltration into our country?

              When Did Donald Warden Become Dr. Khalid Abdullah Al-Mansour?
              <a href="http://archive.is/ozoX5">
               http://archive.is/ozoX5
              </a>
             </p>
             <p>
              Al-Mansour, who organized the development in both Africa and the US, of Wahhabist Madrass’ was interviewed at his law office in San Francisco, before his law firm added bin-Talal to its masthead in the early 80s, and moved back to San Antonio. (Warden/Mansour’s first law partner became a judge, in Oakland I believe.) ....Khalid al-Mansour’s slave name, which he used while a law student at UC’s Boalt Hall, and during his activities as a founder of African American Association and the Black Panthers, is Donald Warden. Warden casually mentioned in a Youtube video that he met Obama while Obama was at Occidental...
             </p>
             <p>
              Warden/Mansour was, among many other activities, recruiting Wahhabi converts from US prisons, and defending OPEC in international court.
             </p>
             <p>
              It was Mansour who contacted Percy Sutton, who was the attorney for the three luminaries above, (Malcolm X and Rev Wright, and Louis Farrakhan) as well as for The Muslim Brotherhood, for Charles Rangel, and President of his Manhattan Borough.
             </p>
             <p>
              Mansour, according to a well-circulated local access television interview made in 2007, contacted Sutton in the mid-80s for help getting Obama into Harvard Law. Sutton was proud to help, and mentioned that Mansour assured him that money was not at issue because “Obama’s patron was Alwaleed bin-Talal, one of the world’s richest men.” Shortly before Obama entered Harvard Law, bin-Talal donated twenty million dollars to Harvard. Five or six years later bin-Talal created the “Alwaleed bin-Talal Center for Islamic Studies” at Harvard Divinity School, its best-funded division.
             </p>
             <p>
              At about the same time bin-Talal, probably with al-Mansour as his agent, opened similar centers at Georgetown, Cambridge, American University, and probably, three or four other major Universites. Al-Mansour was involved in the funding of Wahhabi mosques throughout the US. One can conjecture about the silence of the American press.
             </p>
             <p>
              Bin-Talal is the largest private investor in News Corp, which owns the WSJ and FOX news. He was bailed out of his potential total loss, benefiting, much as did Warren Buffet, from Obama’s bailout of Citibank, Goldman Sachs, and GE. Just look at Buffet’s investments and bin-Talal’s and then to the beneficiaries of TARP funds (for which the Peter Schweizer book, “Throw Them All Out” is remarkably concise). He owns major parts of Cisco, Apple, Oracle, etc. etc.

            <blockquote>
             <p>
              Don Warden's name was mentioned in the Oakland newspaper in connection with the African American Association as early as May 1962, and he later appeared on KGO-TV Channel 7. We find the answer to our question in the Placerville Mountain Democrat May 6, 1965, which quoted warden's sister, Jeannette Tucker, who said the Afro American Association had been established three years earlier.
             </p>
             <p>
              (So)...why he changed his name, since he had apparently been a convert to the Nation of Islam since the 1960's. Around the time he met the Saudi Prince, who was attending Menlo College in 1977, Warden began using his Muslim name.
             </p>
             <p>
              The first Saudi prince to attend Menlo College was Prince Mohammed bin Faisal Al Saud (Class of ’63), during the same time Don Warden was creating the Afro American Association while he was in law school at Berkeley on the opposite side of San Francisco Bay. The Black Power Party was formed at Merritt College in Oakland not far from the law school.
             </p>
             <blockquote>
              <p>
               By July 1979, he was being quoted as Khalid Al Mansour, "formal" attorney for OPEC, threatening an oil embargo by the OPEC nations in response to a lawsuit filed against the cartel. The threat of reprisals also included withdrawal of funds on deposit with American banks. The antitrust lawsuit had been filed in December 1978 by the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers in federal court in Los Angeles, and the decision was announced in September at 477 F.Supp. 553 (1979). It is fascinating to note that another attorney who wrote a brief on behalf of Indonesia-U.S. Business Committee of the Indonesian Chamber of Commerce and Industry was Antonin Scalia, then a professor at the University of Chicago, years before he was appointed to the Supreme Court in 1986.
              </p>
             </blockquote>
             <p>
              In 1978 Khalid and his association, Concerned Black Americans In Support of Africa and the Middle East, as well as Islamic Centers of America, Akbar Institute, Muslim League of Canada were named plaintiffs in a defamation suit which was thrown out of court.

             UNINTERRUPTIBLE AUTOPILOT (QRS-11) existed and was deployed to make a human hijacking impossible. The key component of the BUAP is the QRS11 GyroChip  patented by BEI Corporation of Little Rock, Arkansas. The 'patent attorney' on that component was Hillary Clinton of Rose Law, Little Rock. As such she was a named defendant in Civil Case 3:07-cv-49, a Qui Tam filing that was delivered to Attorney General Mukasey and currently sits in AG Holder's office is pending." -

"...SAN DIEGO – Retired U.S. Navy Rear Admiral Bruce Loveless and David Newland, chief of staff to the Commander of the Navy’s Seventh Fleet, along with seven other high-ranking Navy officers are charged in a federal grand jury indictment with acting as a team of moles for a foreign defense contractor, trading military secrets and substantial influence for sex parties with prostitutes, extravagant dinners and luxury travel.
...In addition to the nine defendants charged today, the 11 Navy officials charged so far in the fraud and bribery investigation are: Admiral Robert Gilbeau; Captain Michael Brooks; Captain Daniel Dusek; Commander Jose Luis Sanchez; Commander Michael Misiewicz; Commander Bobby Pitts; Lt. Commander Gentry Debord; Lt.

             When I first peeked beneath the veneer of the 'official' 9/11 story, I was horrified (red pill as you say) back then about 3? Years ago, I stumbled onto a youtube video about this^^^^which basically said that the usa had been taken over (by neocons) and ended by saying that the film was made by those in the us military still loyal to the usa....have never been able to pull that video up since then....anyone know of it?

             From what I understood, or what has been popular theory, is that Rumsfeld intentionally struck the Pentagon with a missle and hit the exact office that was accountable for Pentagon budget money to destroy all the records. The next day Rumsfeld announced that 2 Trillion dollars was missing and he didn't know where it went. There was so much panic and confusion at the time that everybody pretty much forgot about that 2 Trillion dollars.

               Maybe so. They released a video but it was only one frame. One single frame of "something" looking like blur that was about to hit the Pentagon. If they had that footage why one blurry frame?
              </p>
              <p>
               Whatever happened to the Pentagon it was not hit by a jumbo jet that for sure. I saw pictures of it right after it happened and the "wreckage" was laughable for what was supposed to have been a jumbo jet. And the walls had no strike marks from the wings. According to "official" analysis the plane just sort of folded up like an accordion and shoved itself inside the building. yea right...
              </p>
              <p>
               The walls were hardened to be about 4 feet thick I think. Not possible.

                .  Pay close attention to the first 20-25 seconds.This event is approximately 8-10 minutes after detonation. Thick plume of white smoke means what?  What building materials could possibly cause this phenomenon? Look at man near triage blanket in foreground. Why is he worried ( hands to head ), why does reverse direction twice, and then hesitate before proceeding?

            PA+, PA++, PA +++ is Japanese standard for UVA sunscreen protection. UVA rays penetrate deep into the dermis, the skin's thickest layer.

            Trump's tweet where he used +++ was talking about Japan and PM Abe. Is this a message that he is protected in some way or needs to be? Thoughts?

            Sophia wrote the cryptoccurency code. She has the ultimate little black book. Her citizenship allows her to testify. Two weeks after she gets citizenship, bin Talal et al are rounded up and we get news of Iran as a target. This is because the current form of Hivite culture is seated there as followers of Zoroaster. If you still don't understand who the Hivites are, then look into Asenath, the Egyptian woman given to Joseph in Genesis. After there they spread the cult to the Levant. Phoenicia rose from their practices, worshipping Tanit. They are philosophers and occultists (secret psychological controls only) and will co-opt any belief system in order to control the citizens. They are the architects of civilization. These Hivites send out false prophets to spread their culture far and wide, creating new religions and other methods of control. Zoroaster was one such prophet. He began Zoroastrianism in Iran...where they have had their strongest movement in modern history. Let me know if this is unclear to any if you. I can write more about it, but it's a difficult concept to wrap one's brain around.

             Kristen S. Boyesen asked me to share this with you and I said I'd be honored.
This goes along with why Q Anon repeatedly asks us to meme &amp; pray, both languages of our deepest subconscious. We are truly in a holy war between good &amp; evil. This information reminds me of the final scene in one of my favorite childhood books, "A Wrinkle in Time."
That scene has been like a talisman, a touchstone, reminding me of why I am here &amp; alive in this moment in time &amp; space.
We are all here now for this reason.
            </p>
            <p>
             BELOW:
            </p>
            <p>
             Here is truth as I see it, by K Boyesen 11/11/17. It may change as new information comes in or it is clarified.
********* Know, as you read this, that human unity consciousness is way more powerful than what is discussed below. We have abilities undreamed of by most, including interplanetary travel through our conscious thoughts.
Know that, and have no fear of this AI bunch of circuits which could NEVER do that. We CAN, and will, as we transform from carbon DNA to crystalline, as we move from 3D into 5D. *********
The answer to the posted question?
Credit card points are ((bitcoin)), and add to (blockchain) data.
The (blockchain) is gathering data from every human emotion to figure out ways to control us by fear and create wealth. Credit card Points collect spending patterns as connected to emotions.
This information is from several videos I have listened to on the topic. The latest is (Vegas Strong)
It and the others, describe planet sized brain (bitcoin, blockchain) that are slated to be in control of everything. 
(podesta, paddock, &amp; other names currently in the news are involved)
The word ("strong" ) is a (blockchain) word. A code of some kind that ties it together.
(Blockchain) can be equated to the synapses of the human brain. The brain is the receiver. The collective consciousness is the computer.
All the recent terrorist events in the US have united st the local level by the word (strong), but the AI (blockchain) uses that word to coordinate the info gathering on human responses to fear.
This video goes with the previous videos that were even longer. (Element 93 and the Singularity with Quinn Michaels and Jason Goodman is one of them) There is one after that I have not watched. (I just tried adding a link to the first one in a reply on a different post, and the whole reply disappeared) 😳
This ever-forming planet sized AI brain created through (blockchain) may very well be responsible for all the terror attacks, each created to mine human emotions to add to the AI data base on how to control us.
The supercolliders are involved, too, and they are underground all over the planet. There is another being built in the Midwest right now. There is one under Vegas.
It is said that this planet sized AI brain is headed towards planetary control, and is the real WWIII. Once started, is not stoppable because the computers are so fast and so interconnected. It is, as always, being introduced bit by bit as benevolent, but the goal is the opposite.
What I have heard is, in order to literally save the planet, we need to unplug from this and unify through human conscious rather than AI consciousness.
Human consciousness is way more powerful, but we have been dumbed down by the AI Matrix and don't know of this power.
Unplug from the story line that life will be better if we all jump into AI as a way to make our lives better. That is the carrot. The stick is unseen until it is too late. 
In the video (Vegas strong) the word was "duped".
I am an artist, not a technician, so my verbiage is simplistic, but this is my understanding. It is unfolding now. The video (Vegas strong) is the latest, and is here.

              This Hivite mindset is not isolated to Iran and far from it. It is the same philosophy that the Clinton cult runs on. The Black Nobility (royal family), bankiing families i.e. the ilk of Rothschilds and many other families associated with banking. In a nut shell it is known as Luciferianism and Satanism. It is broken in to many factions operating under different names. The Jesuits are one of the nasties factions on planet earth and John Podesta is affiliated with the Jesuits.
             </p>
             <p>
              The Jesuits also pretend to be christians and founded The Society Of Jesus and they hate Jesus more than anybody probably. The dark side of masonry (it has good and bad) has this satanic mindset too.
             </p>
             <p>
              This luciferic/satanic mindset is spread all over the U.S. hiding as its opposite and they can be found buried sometimes in niches they created in Child Protective Services, law enforcement, hospitals, preachers, school teachers, and you name it. In both the Republican and Democratic parties too.
             </p>
             <p>
              They will not appear to look like satanic people and will look like the opposite. They try hard to appear to be VERY helpful and kind and pretend that they would go to the ends of the earth to help people out of the kindness of their heart. They are in control of almost all the charities like the Red Cross etc....
             </p>

              The term Hivites was used because the Hivites were a people said to come from ancient Canaan which is associated with Babylon, The Tower Of Babal, and Sodom and Gomorra. There are many tribes that lived in those days and some were stone cold evil and the Hivites that are said to have come from Mount Hermon are one of them. The evil fucks operate like a hive, Hivites.

            I'm not getting this NK is a LARP stuff.  Is Q suggesting that NK isn't a concentration camp of a country, led by a very pampered, evil dictator, who wouldn't blink twice to kill his own family members if he felt threatened by them?  A leader who would be willing to starve his own people to fill his wants, like a to fund a military or to buy nuclear capability?  A leader who is foolish enough, and arrogant enough, and deceived enough that he would think to threaten the largest military power in the world?  What exactly is LARP about NK, would someone please explain.

             The suggestion has been made that NK is a CIA creation. Kim received a Western education encouraging the belief that he was trained by the West in other ways. The NK threat is worth a lot of money to a lot of people (defence industry.) Without the NK threat much less would have to be spent on various weapon-systems. There is an element of comedy 'bad guy' about Kim which, viewed from a certain perspective, underlines the theatricality of the whole thing.

              There is not just an element of "bad guy", I have heard the testimonies of Christians who have spent time in his horrific jails and of others who smuggle Bibles in to NK and tell first hand of what they see and hear from those living there.  Please don't belittle these people's suffering by suggesting it's all a joke or a hoax.

              I like your thought process. Can you tie in "This is the End." Into that theatrical metaphor? Is there anything to be learned from "This is the End"? If you aren't familiar it's the movie with James Franco and North Korea

            Interesting that an Anon says
            <em>
             "The Vatican, the queen (head of the Illum) is going down."
            </em>
           </p>
           <p>
            I just realized they're characterizing the Vatican, as the "queen", the head of the Illuminati. Interesting that Pope Francis came out condemning the possession and use of nuclear weapons (Catholic Church has never said this before; he's making this up.) just as the globalists, namely  Senator Bob Corker, is trying to take away Trump's power to use nuclear weapons.
           </p>
           <p>
            As usual, Pope Francis is in lock-step with the globalist elite.

            BRITISH MILITARY JUST PLAYED "THE LAST POST" probably as bugle call for infantry..before a soccer game between germany and england..this is is highly related imo..i've never seen it before..and i've seen hundreds of games..
           </p>
           <p>
            "The "Last Post" is either a bugle call within British infantry regiments or an E♭ cavalry trumpet call in British cavalry and Royal Regiment of Artillery (Royal Horse Artillery and Royal Artillery) used at Commonwealth military funerals and ceremonies commemorating those who have been killed in war. Its duration varies typically from a little over one minute to nearly three minutes.[1] For ceremonial use, the Last Post is often followed by "The Rouse", or less usually the longer "Reveille".[2][3]"

            they've worked so hard over here to brainwash people into thinking souveiregnty is just a bad habit.the queen and the saudi connection..is in Qs posts..i think they flooded germany with migrants as assets or sleeper cells..it was obvious from the beginnig..but with Q dump in mind it manifests as some kind of reality..

              I don't know anything, I'm trying to understand and that's what i What I read too. do u think about map legend being about tunnels? When does a map become a guide? When ur in a tunnel.

             That was so interesting!! It seems like some of the ex-intel people who initially supported Trump are now saying that he has been compromised by the Saudis and bow down to them and that this will cause a war in Lebanon. Lebanon being the only patch of ground left to get a pipeline out to the ocean to get oil out. I am now wondering if the CIA just got punked by DT and the military by allowing the reasonable whitehats in the CIA who would still like to keep those pipeline opportunities open believe that he would allow them to continue to guide foreign policy in an way that could include that. If so, do they even deserve to exist? Cuz it looks like the military  can run circles around them if they want to.

           <p>
            District Court of Maryland filed 41 sealed criminal cases this week. Also VAED has almost 20 filed since 11/3. Seems like the storms heading a bit north of the swamp.

            I have found these names connected with owning Besta Pizza from an old Voat post .
           </p>
           <p>
            Abdul Hamade and Samir Sbitan are the owner and main principal of Besta. HIZ Inc is the business name I suppose, which has a man named Richard Flora as director IIRC.  Besta and Pizza Bolis that are Incorporated under Uptown Pizza.

           <p>
            Three things I find very interesting in Q's message last night:
           </p>
           <p>
            1) That North Korea is a LARP, and the parade videos are faked. I've thought for a while that the back-and-forth between Trump and Rocketman was staged and hyperbolic. I've watched several of Fearless Leaders appearances with his people, and it's not difficult to believe he is just acting a part. Bombard Body Language lady has done some interesting videos on him, concluding that he is not what he seems at all. Kim acts like the man behind the curtain in the Wizard of Oz. I've always thought it was a game. Very interesting that Trump reminded Kim of his grandfather's vision and said NK wasn't the heaven his grandfather imagined, but it was "Hell".
           </p>
           <p>
            2) The references to "the house of cards". Of course this refers to the HBO series. Interesting that Zero Hedge some time back thought this show was art imitating life and one of the actors, Doug Stamper, was John Podesta. I've never watched it, so I don't know. More to the point is that "card" was supposed to be a code word in the Podesta emails. I know some work was done on this; if I remember correctly, "cards" were thought to be admission tickets to art museums. I have to look that up.
           </p>
           <p>
            3) The references to "dominos". Two possible meanings to dominos:
           </p>
           <ol>
            <li>
             <p>
              a series of geopolitical events happening in a series and dependent upon each other. The Stratfor guys used "dominos" in this context to describe things going on in the world scene. They also sent out for Dominos pizza a lot, too, and one guy wrote a strange "domino" poem which we analyzed on VOAT.
             </p>
            </li>
            <li>
             <p>
              "Domino" of course, could also mean, in my estimation, the most sinister and horrifying revelation of the Podesta emails---what many of us concluded was a perverted, sadistic pedophile game conducted in secluded mansions on the Labor Day weekend on Martha's Vineyard.
             </p>
            </li>

            Perhaps Q's reference to dominos conflates both meanings? That geopolitical events tied to the worst of the pedophiles are going down.
           </p>
           <p>
            Very interesting that "dominos" and "cards" are mentioned together in Q's thread. If it's true that "cards" and "dominos" refer to pedophile elites' atrocities in art museums and on Martha's Vineyard, it would seem that exposing those criminal activities are the ultimate card to play in Trump's deck and that revelation would bring down their satanic house of cards more than anything. It could cause a "cascade" of falling dominos.
           </p>
           <p>
            Ponder these questions:
           </p>
           <p>
            Is the House of Cards about to fall?
What are dominos?
What is a cascade?
What is the domino effect?
This domino will come last.

             What do people do with cards? They trade them and pass them around. Theory:
            </p>
            <p>
             Cards = Kids
            </p>
            <p>
             House = Family/Bloodline or a location
            </p>
            <p>
             House of Cards = Pedophile network/ring, be it a family, cult or a location, where people "trade cards"
            </p>
            <p>
             One family/network/ring after the other. It starts with SA and ends up with the EU and probably the UK.
            </p>
            <p>
             SA (and other ME countries), Israel, EU, Ukraine, Russia (Putin bans adoptions to protect orphans), Scandinavia, UK (commonwealth), Asia (including NK), various US states and Hollywood etc. The networks/rings are going down one by one.

              Makes very good sense. Putin was one of the very few who recognized what was going on and stopped it. He knew Russian adoptees in US were being abused, murdered and trafficked online which is why he introduced the ban.
             </p>
             <p>
              "Russian adoptions" is code for international child trafficking, I am convinced.

             My perspective on cards is Casino and gas been since last Vegas,. Also Someone had posted about Gidon Feen griend of Alefantis and Podesta worked at podesta Group  band LET YOUTH SHINE who's partners were owners of three different CASINOS. one being the MONARCH CASINO, which has a PEDOPHILE LOGO OF TWO HEARTS. Also the butterfly mind control or mk  ultra program.... 
But Casino means whorehouse and is a SWEARWORD where when in a TRAFFIC JAM an Italian will comonly /normally /usually say GOD EXECUTIONER PIGMKTHERMARY WHAT A WHOREHOUSE = Dio boia porka Madonna che Casino! CASINA = LITTLE HOUSE but CASINO =WHOREHOUSE. OLD ASS WORD. The Jews AND the Italians were/are great  money people. An Italian told me about money talk..  Banks were tables like benches , that would break,  bankruptcy go under water, recede flood like the Nile, the river banks would  hold the currency....the flow...I think Casinos is where the cards are.

             Dualistic meaning is in all Q's posts, many meanings from a simple start. Cards - the illuminati cards, glowing rabbit is probably the uranium one, the godfather - the mob. Trump knows everything, NK a larp - yes,https://jaysanalysis.com/2017/04/18/north-korea-is-a-fake-cia-state/

            Back in the begnnings of PG on Voat we found that a Saudi (I believe Talal) owned most of the buildings in the block around Comet Pizza, I read it and we had sources.  Does anyone know where that is?  I wanted to do a write up for T_D about the connections and that was an important one to include.

             I researched into the buildings to the left of Comet (as you look at it from the street) that all fall under the 5039 address with different lot numbers. My initial research can be found here

             </a>
             for all of these lots (there are 24 in total that fall under the 5039 number, 7 buildings and 17 parking spaces or storage facilities). This has since changed slightly with the lots owned by Barbara Meade (formerly of Politics &amp; Prose) now being owned by Sibley Luck LLC (which is Headed by Allison Sibley, Psychotherapist, of Sibley &amp; Associates). According to their website they are due to move in this coming week, 16th November). Nothing else appears to have changed.

             There are comments in thread 1 and 2 with old post links. I took a quick look and it's complicated. It seems nothing was proven, but I'd love to be proven otherwise. This is so important, I think the most important thing to do, as a community, right now, is to look through all that research again and find an answer. Imagine if it could be proven true?

             There's a comment in this thread too about it. Please, please, if you can, take a look. I'd be all over it myself if i wasn't managing these threads, equally important I think. God Speed and let me know if you need any help finding the old threads.

            I don't think any of this good stuff will happen it's too good to be true. Trump is a coward and a moron he's already owned by the deep state swamp they obviously have videos of him fucking 12 year old girls with Epstein. He's going to be killed or incapacitated by an induced stroke or forced to resign because he failed to realize the snakes and vipers he was surrounding himself with. This entire storm is coming narrative is delusional it's wishful thinking and internet masturbation. I might be wrong but I don't think so.

             Matt, you know they've lost the ability to pay you, right?  You should shut down your computer, have a stiff drink and when you wake up tomorrow freshen up your resume. With all your recent experience a new and exciting career in legitimate marking is just around the corner for you!
             <br/>
             God bless.

            Remember how this sub tried connecting Saudi Arabia &gt; Andrew Kline &gt; Bests Pizza block, and the mods shit themselves and "debunked" or deleted each post? I'm no good at trying to research it, but if it helps anyone, keep in mind searchvoat.co results includes deleted submissions.

            q # 245
What fake news anchor will not be on air tonight?
           </p>
           <p>
            I believe answer is CNN Erin Burnett
           </p>
           <p>
            She was not on air that night. She is with CNN, fake news, so she is fake. Her husband works for Citibank, SA connection, and she is on CFR, Council of Foreign Relations.

             I can't find any proof of this. Quick google search yielded nothing, and neither her twitter nor her show's twitter mentioned her being off air.

             I thought this was in reference to Jimmy Fallon, who announced on Sat, shortly after Q's post, that he was cancelling for a week due to his mother's poor health (and later death).

            The one thing thats really bugging me is the information about the indictments.  It seems like theres a huge debate about wether these are all actual indictments or if this is even unusual in the first place.  Also does anyone have a clue when we might learn who is in the indictments?

             Someone really really really likes gold. Wasn't there reports of a big flatbed truck found in the rubble of the towers with some gold bars on it? There was a YUGE gold vault under there? How much was recovered? If you know that the towers are coming down, why waste that good gold? Was a heist planned? Who made money from foreknowledge?

             NK has never really been a threat. Historically they toss up a few stink bombs to extort lunch money because they have little capability to feed themselves and it provides an excuse for the US to keep troops in Seoul. However, if there are external players such as CIA  in control there, that may actually be a very real threat since they use war as a cash machine.

               Over the next year, honeypots like 8chan, 4chan, and voat are going to sell to you that Saudi Arabia did 9/11. Just remember that it was done by the Mossad and CIA with CGI (no planes or victims to even hide) and 3 subterranean thermonuclear weapons which vaporized/cavitated/vulcanized the bedrock below the buildings and sank them into their footprints. Why was it done? Same reason they faked the moon landings. To spite the God of the Abrahamic religions who said that humans were forbidden from going to the heavens. You can see how slaughtering millions of Muslims would fit in with spiting the God of Abraham:

               The nukes weren't subterranean thats C$A disinfo propegated by their asset Dimetry Khalesov. It doesn't fit physics nor what we observed. Its designed to make nukers look stupid. The buildings were mainly destroyed using a single Thermobaric Fusion Fireball "fizzle" Nuke that simply fell down through the building vaporizing them at very high temperatures. Aside from that conventional mini- nukes were used when the CGI "planes" hit to take out the heavy mechanical floors.

               I'd heard of events with 4/8 chan  but how's Voat a honeypot? A honeypot in so far as the entire internet's compromised, or do you mean just the mods/userbase of particular subs? I mean, I wouldn't doubt the 9/11 stuff you say, but is something up with the site?

            , for all your hard work, and for all who are contributing. Wish I could help more but am in the midst of unpacking furniture and house is upside down. Praying for you all as events rapidly unfold.

            Oh wow I didnt realise there was any community here also looking at this, I have just had my eyes bleeding for the last week on chan managed to catch this from the start. Excellent summary. Few points the sealed indictments from the RSS feed are not the sealed ones we are looking for but a nice find all the same, they are pending court cases largely you can see George 'ahem mossad cough' Webb's case in there.
           </p>
           <p>
            The sealed indictments in Virginia may not be something of note, it's as per my understanding customary to have sealed indictments for general proceedings to protect privacy in that state. Given its a pedo hub im not surprised that the default in that state is withheld identity. I could be completely wrong on this point I dont know personally.

            Is Titus credible? I was never fully convinced either way.

             Many here can't do the eyebleed thing on 4Chan so it's been happening over here with these threads. Everyone manning stations, all hands on deck. I really appreciate you pointing the errors out and I'll go correct them. If you've any updates you can pass to us, it would be most excellent. If you'd like to post them in the comments, I'll update the OP. Hope your eyes hold out, I know the feeling lulz...
