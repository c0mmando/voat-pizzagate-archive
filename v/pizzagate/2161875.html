Louis Lamonica was head of the Hosanna Church at Ponchatoula.  In 2005 he walked into the police station and gave a confession that satanic rituals were held in the \'youth room\' of the church and he detailed years of horrific abuse of children.  This is part of what he said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>They would start off like a church service but it was Satanic music. There were candles burning, dark, red candleholders. And the dedication of baby A into Satan with this Pentagram, she was put in the middle, in a black dress.’</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He described chanting around the child before killing a cat, draining its blood and each drinking it. He claimed they did not make the child drink because she was too young and instead took off her dress and sprinkled the blood over her. These meetings, according to Lamonica, took place once every two to three months.  On other occasions:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>‘certain girls would be picked and have sexual relationships with. The guys would line up, one by one, they would come and they would have sex with that girl. And the same if there was a woman…they would have [a] homosex (sic) relationship and oral sex, acting like one was a man and one was a woman.’</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He claimed that there was ‘feces laid around. There was urine.’ And he claimed that during these satanic rituals he would become ‘distorted’ by the devil and that demons would change him into an animal – ‘a snake, a fox, wolf, spiders.’ At least a dozen \'church\' members took part in the abuse of children.</p>
<p>Lamonica had been abusing his two children for as long as they could remember. The children would not testify against their father in court.   They were forced to perform sexual acts on him and others. </p>
<p><a href="http://www.reid.com/pdfs/summer2010/Lamonica.pdf">This</a> document states:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>...he performed oral sex on M.L. when he was four or five years old. The defendant began having anal sex with both M.L. and S.L. when they were five or six years old. The defendant further indicated that sexual activity involving several people, including A.B., occurred at Hosanna Church. ...  He described orgies at the church involving his sons, A.B., and teenaged members of the church all having sex with several adult members of the church, including the defendant. The defendant stated that most of the time he had sex with his sons at home, but that he had sex with them.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Police found a notebook that Lamonica had kept:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>these pages detailed the repeated instances of his orally and anally raping M.L. and S.L. The defendant wrote about having sex with his dog, forcing his sons to have sex with each other, and raping S.L., starting from the age of three up until the age of twelve. The defendant wrote that he used money, toys, threats, and physical abuse to control and rape his sons. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Another church member, Austen Trey Bernard, had been abusing his baby daughter and was also charged.</p>

            Thia is where True Detective comes from along with the the Yellow King mythverse. In True Detective they made it a point that the monster slain, the retarded  guy  who fucks his cousin and mows lawns for the state, is not the full, or even close to,  the full extension of the monster, the one that's been there before and after you and I will be around, which is what the last dialogue about stars and blank spaces is all about where the light is winning since before it was just the dark
