<p>&quot;Ginsburg called for reducing the age of consent for sexual acts to persons who are &quot;less than 12 years old.&quot;
From: <a href="http://www.conservapedia.com/Ruth_Bader_Ginsburg">http://www.conservapedia.com/Ruth_Bader_Ginsburg</a>
The quote is from a book she wrote: Ruth Bader Ginsburg co-authored the book called Sex Bias in the U.S. Code in 1977 with a feminist, Brenda Feigen-Fasteau, for which they were paid with federal funds under Contract No. CR3AK010. The 230-page book was published by the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights. It was written to identify the federal laws that allegedly discriminate on account of sex and to promote ratification of the then-pending federal Equal Rights Amendment (ERA), for which Ginsburg was a fervent advocate. Here are some of Ginsburg’s liberal recommendations set forth in her book Sex Bias in the U.S. Code.</p>
<p>Confirmation: On p. 102 of Sex Bias in the U.S. Code, under the sub-heading “Recommendations,” Ginsburg and Feigen-Fasteau recommend a revision of 18 U.S.C. §2032 from “carnal knowledge of any female, not his wife who has not attained the age of sixteen years” to “A person is guilty of an offense if he engages in a sexual act with another person, not his spouse, and . . . the other person is, in fact, less than 12 years old“. Below is the pertinent paragraph:</p>
<p>18 U.S.C. §2032 — Eliminate the phrase “carnal knowledge of any female, not his wife who has not attained the age of sixteen years” and substitute a Federal, sex-neutral definition of the offense patterned after S. 1400 §1633: A person is guilty of an offense if he engages in a sexual act with another person, not his spouse, and (1) compels the other person to participate: (A) by force or (B) by threatening or placing the other person in fear that any person will imminently be subjected to death, serious bodily injury, or kidnapping; (2) has substantially impaired the other person’s power to appraise or control the conduct by administering or employing a drug or intoxicant without the knowledge or against the will of such other person, or by other means; or (3) the other person is, in fact, less than 12 years old.
Ginsburg (and her co-author) also recommends that the Mann Act be repealed. The Mann Act is a federal law passed in 1910 which makes it a felony to engage in interstate or foreign commerce transport of “any woman or girl for the purpose of prostitution or debauchery, or for any other immoral purpose”.</p>
<p>From Sex Bias in the U.S. Code, pp. 98-99:</p>
<p>The Mann Act . . . poses the invasion of privacy issue in an acute form. The Mann Act also is offensive because of the image of women it perpetuates . . . . It was meant to protect from ‘the villainous interstate and international traffic in women and girls,’ ‘those women and girls who, if given a fair chance, would, in all human probability, have been good wives and mothers and useful citizens. . . .’</p>
<p>In other words, if Ruth Bader Ginsburg has her way, sexual abuse of children 12-years or older would not be a crime, nor would child sex trafficking.

<p>I think this woman and her friends need to be looked into. &quot;Despite their fundamental differences, Ginsburg considered Scalia her closest colleague on the Court. The two justices had often dined and attended the opera together.&quot; From: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruth_Bader_Ginsburg">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruth_Bader_Ginsburg</a></p>',

            Would love that. It's up to PuttItOut, owner and admin of Voat. He has been doing dev work and disabled Search in relation to that, but no details have been shared. Someone theorized that it may be disabled to slow down DDoS attacks...but there's been no word confirming or denying that, either.

             I posted 2 recently to look at the education systems participation in the indoctrination of children and young adults. Millennial_Falcon deleted them both. They don't want us to investigate, just have us stuck in an echo-chamber.
