<blockquote>
<p>An American Catholic priest is accused of having raped in 2009 a young Haitian man aged twelve at the time of the facts in an orphanage in Les Cayes. On September 25, Father Marc Roméo Boisvert who lives in the United States must appear before a court in the jurisdiction of Les Cayes to answer questions from the courts in the context of this case...A letter sent in 2013 to Bishop Chibly Langlois and published online referred to this “allegation of sexual misconduct” to the “Pwojè Espwa” led by Boisvert and which welcomed 600 children and young adults.</p>
<p>..A new wind is blowing in Pwojè Espwa. The new strategy of the mission is to “develop the child and preserve the family”. Father Boisvert accused of pedophilia is no longer in the game. “He was separated from the organization in 2018 and has no authority or responsibility in the organization,” says Milou L\'hérisson, the new CEO of Espwa.</p>

<p>Please take immediate action to stop Ms. Orlowski from continuing to obstruct justice by her failure to report to church and law enforcement authorities about alleged sexual misconduct by a Catholic priest and a 12 year old Haitian boy at Pwoje Espwa in Les Cayes, Haiti...<strong>Ms. Orlowski has known for many years that Fr. Marc Boisvert, O.M.I. has been accused of engaging in inappropriate sexual misconduct with children.</strong> ... Child protection advocates are now raising serious questions about the methods by which an investigation was conducted at Pwoje Espwa concerning a child’s statement that the child slept with Fr. Boisvert in Fr. Boisvert’s bed.</p>
<p>Ms. Orlowski is resisting all efforts to get to the truth. In fact, her passive aggressive attitude is downright hostile. Ms. Orlowski is identified on the Santiago de Compostela Church web site as the parish’s Facilities and Events Manager...By way of background, Ms. Orlowski is a long time officer of the non-profit group (www.freethekids.org) that operates Pwoje Espwa. <strong>She leads groups and travels to Haiti on a regular basis.</strong> In addition, Ms. Orlowski raises money from Santiago de Compostela parishioners on behalf of Free the Kids.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Free the Kids, a charity that supports Pwoje Espwa (Project Hope), a Haitian orphanage, has set a goal to raise $12,000 in 24 hours on Tuesday, Dec. 3...The newspaper reported that weeks of unrest, rampant corruption and economic malaise have led to soaring prices, disintegration of public services and a sense of insecurity and lawlessness....</p>
<p>Jack Reynolds, an elder at Fountain Hills Presbyterian Church supporting the orphanage, said armed gangs breached the security wall twice and robbed the staff and children of cell phones, food and cash. Noon Kiwanis Club, Four Peaks and Fountain Hills Rotary Clubs raised funds in the community to feed the youngsters.</p>
<p>Reynolds, a member of the Free the Kids’ board of directors; Kenneth J. Brown, then-associate pastor of Presbyterian Church, and Roger Bates visited Pwoje Espwa in January 2017. Reynolds said his most recent visit was last January. <strong>Reynolds’ brother-in-law, Catholic priest Father Marc Boisvert,</strong> had supervised the compound until his retirement last year because of health issues. He now lives in Florida.</p>

He was deployed to serve in Desert Shield/Desert Storm, later returning to complete his tour of duty in Okinawa. His next tour of duty took him to Mayport, Florida. Speaking fluent French made Fr.

              Members of the Missionary Oblates of Mary Immaculate have been involved in several sex scandals in Canada, in large part due to their participation in the Residential School System.
             </strong>
             The Oblates of Manitoba, Saskatchewan and Northwestern Ontario faced over 2000 lawsuits and tens of millions of dollars in damages because of sex abuse claims.[17] As of 2018, the Oblates of Quebec were ready to settle out of court a class-action lawsuit by 72 people who say they were assaulted by 17 Oblates who worked in
             <strong>
              Quebec's Abitibi, Mauricie and North Shore regions.

              The Congregation Oblates of Mary Immaculate in Cap-Haitien,
             </strong>

            <p>
             Last week, Senior U.S. District Judge Robert N. Chatigny approved of the multi-million-dollar settlement for victims of convicted pedophile Douglas Perlitz, who sexually abused as many as 170 minors at Project Pierre Toussaint, a school for orphaned boys that he founded in the city of Cap-Haitien...Among those liable for the $60 million settlement are Jesuit-run Fairfield University in Connecticut, the Society of Jesus of New England and the U.S. branch of the Order of Malta. Also liable in the settlement are donor Hope E. Carter and Jesuit priest Fr. Paul E. Carrier — a mentor to Perlitz who helped him with the charity work.

             As we entered into the season of Easter,  the children of Pwoje Espwa carried with them their faith in His love and gratitude in your devotion. Pwoje Espwa believes that instilling a sense of faith and gratitude is a vital part of child development. This is why Father Gregoire and his religious education program are so important in keeping His word at the forefront of the children’s minds.

            <p>
             Palm Sunday was just as Jesus walked into Jerusalem seven days before being crucified. House mothers, staff, visitors, and children gathered in front of the Quad and walked toward the chapel with palms in their hands.
            </p>
            <p>
             Mass with Father Gregoire was beautiful and included a recitation of The Passion with some of the older kids. The service ended with everyone singing together joyfully in unison as they prepare for Good Friday and Easter Sunday next week
            </p>
            <p>
             The retreat was organized by the faithful community of Salesians of Don Bosco. The pastoral staff from Espwa accompanied the young retreatants.

            HAITI: Salesian Missions reflects on 10 years of rebuilding Haiti after the devastating 2010 earthquake -

           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             Salesian missionaries were among the first responders—providing shelter and medical aid, means to securely transport, store and distribute relief supplies and clean drinking water, and possessing an important understanding of how to get things done in Haiti.
            </p>
            <p>
             ..Salesian missionaries began working in Haiti in 1935 in response to the Haitian government’s request for a professional school. Since then, Salesian missionaries have expanded their work to include 11 main educational centers and more than 200 schools across the country that serve some 20,000 primary school students and 5,500 secondary school students.
            </p>
           </blockquote>
           <p>
            Salesian missionaries are also building new schools. A new Salesian elementary school was built in Les Cayes in 2018 to accommodate additional students. The school, built through the Rinaldi Foundation, the Salesian planning and development office in Haiti, welcomed its initial first-grade class in September 2018. Featuring nine classrooms, student and teacher bathrooms, two computer rooms and administrative offices, the school will serve 360 children from the area each year. A second phase of construction will add more classrooms to the building.
           </p>
           <p>
            Most recently in July 2019, Salesian missionaries launched a new initiative to train teachers of technical and vocational institutes. Called the ENTEC Technical School, the new school in Port-au-Prince aims to improve the quality of education and employment prospects of young Haitians by ensuring that their teachers have the most up-to-date training available.
           </p>
           <p>
            Father Victor Auguste, director general of the Rinaldi Foundation, said, “It inspires me that Salesian missionaries are making a difference in Haiti to provide a better quality of education for the future of our youth. In all of our schools, we are doing our best to work not only to improve the physical structures but also there is a great desire and passion to teach a diverse field of subjects so that our students can achieve personal success and give back to their communities and continue to rebuild our country.”

            REESTABLISHING YOUTH CENTERS
           </p>
           <p>
            The Lakay House for Street Children, an indispensable Salesian-run center that provided shelter, education and food to dozens of street children with nowhere else to turn, was completely destroyed by the earthquake, leaving children without shelter. Lakay has been back in operation for some time and home to nearly 150 former street children. In addition to classroom studies, a donated school bus has made it possible for youth to take part in field trips to educational and historical sites around Haiti.
           </p>
           <p>
            In 2015, from funding provided by donors, Salesian Missions fulfilled a long-standing promise to reconstruct the Salesian Youth Center in Fort Liberté, which had been reduced to rubble. First opened in 2002, the youth center in Fort Liberté offers a broad range of formal and informal educational programs for local youth. It houses an elementary school, technical school, vocational training center, teacher-training program and one of the country’s only nursing schools.
           </p>
           <p>
            Salesian missionaries have also established the Thorland Youth Center Port-au-Prince, which is serving an estimated 650 youth and young adults aged 14 and older. At Thorland, Salesian missionaries operate a “school of soccer” that is successfully providing youth a healthy outlet for exercise, team play and connecting with their peers. An estimated 120 students, both boys and girls aged 9 to 19, are registered in this program.
           </p>
           <p>
            DEVELOPING INFRASTRUCTURE
           </p>
           <p>
            When building new infrastructure, Salesian missionaries thought long-term. A warehouse that was built using funds from Salesian Missions, made possible by donations from donors who responded after the earthquake, was instrumental in the emergency response after Hurricane Matthew. The warehouse was used for not only for storage but also as the staging ground where missionaries and other volunteers assembled the initial 400 survival kits. A delivery truck also funded by Salesian Missions made the transport to Les Cayes possible. Due to poor road conditions in Haiti, this truck and others, now 10 years old, need to be upgraded. Salesian missionaries in Haiti are in search for funding.
           </p>
           <p>
            Never forgetting that hungry children have a harder time learning in school, Salesian missionaries focused attention on feeding programs. Salesian students at six Salesian centers in Haiti received access to better nutrition thanks to a grant from the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID). Salesian Missions secured the grant for its Hunger for Education USAID International Food Relief Partnership project in Haiti. The project aimed to increase the health and learning capacity of students by implementing school feeding programs in Salesian centers within the country.

            Fr. Auguste said, “It’s impossible to think of quality of education without a feeding program in Haiti because ‘Sak vid pa kanpe’, which means an empty bag cannot stand by itself.

              Salesian students at six Salesian centers in Haiti are receiving access to better nutrition this year thanks to a grant from the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID). Salesian Missions, the U.S. development arm of the Salesians of Don Bosco headquartered in New Rochelle, N.Y., secured the grant for its Hunger for Education USAID International Food Relief Partnership project in Haiti. The project aims to increase the health and learning capacity of students by implementing school feeding programs in Salesian centers within the country.

           <blockquote>
            <p>
             2011, Pwoje Espwa, an orphanage and school in Haiti, was founded by Father Marc Boisvert, a Lewiston native who became a priest in the order of the Oblates of Immaculate Mary. Formerly a chaplain in the U.S. Navy, he arrived in Haiti in 1998 and has been there ever since.
            </p>
            <p>
             ..We have been donating to Theo’s Work, which has provided funding for Father Marc’s work, and this past summer we attended a fundraiser at the Colony Hotel in Kennebunkport. That is when we met Fr. Marc Boisvert for the first time. Also there was Dr. Cynthia DeSoi, who practices nephrology, internal medicine and pediatrics here in Lewiston.
            </p>
            <p>
             ..Four of us accompanied Dr. DeSoi. Claudette Reny has often accompanied Dr. DeSoi; this was her 19th trip there. Also traveling with us was John (Ralph) Robitaille, a local contractor, and Joe Makley, an information technology director for the Portland School Department...
             <strong>
              Dr. DeSoi invited us to her home for a pizza and packing party.
             </strong>
             We loaded 10 large duffle bags with medical supplies, shoes from New Balance and uniforms from the former Trinity Catholic School here in Lewiston that Claudette Reny was able to secure from Bishop Malone.
            </p>
            <p>
             ..We had a driver waiting for us. We loaded up the 12-passenger van, and our driver Jean Gary drove us through Port au Prince,
             <strong>
              where I saw virtually no change from when I was there last April.
             </strong>
             It was a four-hour drive at night through the mountains to arrive in Les Cayes. We had to call Village Espwa to send out another vehicle, as the ride from the main road to Vilaj Espwa is so bad that our vehicle couldn’t make it through.
            </p>
            <p>
             The next morning we were awakened by the beautiful sound of Haitian young men praying and singing. They are discerning whether they have a vocation to become priests. It was still dark, and they were in the chapel downstairs. Their chant made you feel like you were in a monastery. We hadn’t seen Father Marc yet, and as I lay in bed, I thought about how this man has dedicated his life to bring God’s word and love to these people in a foreign land. It is truly dedication beyond comprehension. There definitely is a place awaiting him in heaven, as there is for Dr. DeSoi and Claudette Reny.
            </p>
            <p>
             <strong>
              Paige Orlowski, a young lady from Phoenix, Arizona
             </strong>
             who first started at Pwoje Espwa as a volunteer and speaks fluent Creole, is now employed there and is in charge of all facilities. She is a wonderful young woman who enjoys the respect of everyone she comes into contact with, and she is a person filled with love. She took us on a tour of the entire village with Father Marc. It was a wonderful experience, especially going into the classrooms. The kids would greet us with a song of welcome.
            </p>
            <p>
             After lunch Joe Makley and I worked in the clinic doing data entry of polio immunization. Dr. DeSoi along with Dr. Lawrence Mutty and his wife Danielle of Castine, Maine, who had been there for two weeks, treated many patients all day long. John Robitaille went with Father Marc and Deacon Peter Faford to look at a couple of different models of homes...
            </p>
            <p>
             I had known
             <strong>
              Father Marc’s parents, as they were members of Holy Cross Parish here in Lewiston.
             </strong>
             His father was a retired postal worker. Father Marc said when he was young, his father would bring him to Simones Hot Dog restaurant. Before we left, Jimmy Simones gave Claudette Reny a T-shirt from Simones Hot Dogs to give to Father Marc. He was pleased and wanted a photo of me presenting it to him.
            </p>
            <p>
             ...On Wednesday, March 2, we loaded a vehicle with U.S. AID cases of food and brought them to the Les Cayes Prison. We had been told that the prison, which has over 450 prisoners, had only one day’s supply of food left. We unloaded many cases of food and placed them in the prison’s storage.
            </p>
            <p>
             ..Paige Orlowski visits there often with Linda Faford, the wife of Deacon Peter Faford, who lives at Vilaj Espwa full time. They talk to them in Creole, and Paige’s mere presence lets them know that someone cares. They hold her with the highest respect. The conditions there are truly inhumane. I have never seen such conditions in my life.
            </p>
            <p>
             ..
             <strong>
              We also visited a hospital/residence called La Charité, which is run by the Daughters of Charity (Mother Theresa’s Order).
             </strong>
             This is a beautiful hospital that is immaculately clean in the midst of a very poor city. There, we saw patients dying from AIDS, as well as infirmed children of all ages.
            </p>
            <p>
             I talked to a couple of Mother Theresa’s sisters. They radiate love, peace and joy. They were from India, and they spoke English.
             <strong>
              I asked them to pray for the people of Lewiston.
             </strong>
             They promised me they would and they had me write down my name and the City of Lewiston. I told them I would pray for them also. They truly are saintly women.
