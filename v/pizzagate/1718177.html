<p>The SRA articles is titled as:

<p>Further in the article it describes the murderous boys Halloween nightmare.... yeah... SRA victims can attest to Halloween nightmares.

<p>Apparently he watched the movie &quot;Halloween&quot;.</p>
<p>Another interesting aspect of this story is that this young boy grew up and was caught with child pornography. According The the article, &quot;Probation officers and police are trying to establish what contact he has had with children since his release from a secure unit in 2001 and how Venables came to be in possession of the appalling images.</p>
<p>Their worst fears are he could be part of an internet paedophile ring which traded sick images of children.&quot;</p>',

             Halloween
