            Fuck this shit. I have a lot to say about this and terry Crews is amazing for coming forth. Imagine if he punched out that creep. His career would be finished and he would be charged with assault. Like i said, i have a lot to say about his. My 4 year old was threatened to be hurt ( for talking to me about men beating up mommy) because my ex was involved with entertainment types and was a call girl -prostitute. My career was finished overnight PLUS I was then hounded and death threatened, harassed and destroyed.She was (my ex) involved with some heavy players and I was also at the time starting a little production company up in Vancouver called LionsGate. All paperwork STOLEN. It was so nefarious I even had safety box break ins....at banks!! I kid you not!! Scum runs Hollywood and you would be surprised to learn who she was involved with. Had a break in 2 days ago, art work stolen so after 23 years, this saga is not over. If you need my IMDB name, it is Stephen Shellen and yeah, I was at the time, a working actor. That came to a crashing halt.NO ONE around me cared about the fact my children were stolen and I was targeted. Just unreal unless someone has lived it. Again, Bravo Terry. God knows. That's my conclusion after all these years, God does know.

             He was a pro footballer too so not just vanity muscles.  I don't think the fact that he looks the way he does and is also a victim is lost on him and it is pretty awesome of him to put himself out there.

              Right on! I was a pretty wild guy but I knew if I punched out one of these creeps I was finished or at least set up. In the end, it didn't matter much but my focus has changed over the years. The spiritual battlefield is fought in ways that transcend just violence or the physical.Sorry if I injected too much of me in this but I feel passionate about Terry and his choices on how he fought back.

            In fact, he seems to be the only man in PedoWood outside of Woods and a couple of others.

             Ask DiFi why her husband spends so much time in Nepal (where the recently arrested famous Canadian pedo was found hiding out) and has his own child trafficking charity there, The American Himalayan Foundation. Just how did this power couple get so rich?

             is just downright bizarre. (DISCLAIMER: I didn't screen that video; my flash is acting up.) Apparently, it begins with them returning to a property to find other people had been living there. They claim there was a conspiracy with forged documents. Very strange. Kat Williams is another name that comes to mind.

              Actually, if we think about this in a different way, we can see when the pedos officially took over and made it a closed club. Woods and Quaid had very viable careers in the beginning, but are not part of the cabal. I doubt if ''outsiders'' (and by outsiders, I mean non-cabal pervs) would be given jobs now. No outsiders, they're assured of no one talking. So if we can figure out when their careers were cut short, it's probably around when this complete takeover occurred.

                They may have run it, but outsiders did get in. They brought in outside talent. They felt they had to because no one there is talented on their own. So they tolerated outsiders. Have you seen any movies lately? They suck ... no, they're worse than that. And they're pretty much all remakes.
               </p>
               <p>
                So it's that time I'm talking about. They time when they used to use outsiders and are now stuck with actors/actresses on par with Alyssa Milano for depth. Now that skank is someone that always turns in a compelling performance.
