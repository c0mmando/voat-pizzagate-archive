            Here is the even bigger picture :)
           </p>
           <p>
            I have studied the elite for 20 years. Pizzagate isn't wholly new to me, but the scale took me aback. The elite sacrifice children for a reason. It is modern day worship of Saturn/Isis.
           </p>
           <p>
            Here is the whole story of Pizzagate for anyone interested. The truth is stranger than fiction.
           </p>

           <p>
            The Scottish Masonic Order and their affiliates rule our planet. They are a direct continuation of the Brotherhood of Amon Ra that existed in Egypt 3500 years ago. Knights Templar, Medici's, Pheonicians were just a couple of the links in between. Our leaders are obsessed with Egyptian symbolism, specifically the story of Isis and Osiris. It's basically pretty cool math/geometry, but they have perverted it and made it into an esoteric movement. These people literally invented creationism and our religions (Islam, Non-Gnostic Christianity, Judaism). The Star of David is, at its heart, a mathematical symbol.
           </p>
           <p>
            Here you go (explore the Egyptian/mathematical symbolism through art and architecture of the past 2 thousand years):

            I know it is 4 hours long, but you won't be the same after you watch it. I promise. It made a lifelong atheist and scientist question his assumption that the mysterious was cornered off to quantum mechanics and neuroscience.

            This guy is really funny. He sucks as a speaker, and looks insane, but info checks out (and awesome Australian accent). It'll make a man go insane.

            Please refrain from calling me a shill because that sounds so fucking crazy. I know what it sounds like.
            <strong>
             Downvote me if you think it is a coincidence the the latitude of the King's Chamber at the pyramids at Giza is the speed of light (in m/s), accurate to at least 6 digits. You would have to think Pizzagate is a coincidence too.
            </strong>
            The meter was defined in 1800, but it was merely rediscovered. It is a length ingrained into the architecture of our solar system, as any student of Masonry would learn. Here is the King's chamber when measured in meters:

            <a href="http://www.secretsinplainsight.com/wp-content/uploads/KingsChamber555.jpg">
             http://www.secretsinplainsight.com/wp-content/uploads/KingsChamber555.jpg
            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            Maybe the meter isn't so arbitrary after all, if it is being used to encode the golden ratio in Egypt, thousands of years before the System International. By the way, the perimeter of the chamber's base is 10 pi meters. They squared the circle at the same time.
           </p>
           <p>
            Numerology and mythology seem pretty fucking retarded, and they are, but our leaders fucking love it. You have to understand it, in order to understand our current situation, and them. It goes back thousands of years. If there is anything that you guys should be learning through Pizzagate, it is that many of the men and the women with the tin foil hats on, were preaching reality in your face (to a limit- I think that limit is aliens, but I am open minded). I think that it can be easy to try to explain this Egyptian symbolism as artistic influence, but major historic figures have gone out of their fucking way to make a point of it (as you will see in the first video).
           </p>
           <p>
            Last thing, FUCK THE BROTHERHOOD OF AMON RA. They sacrifice children like sheep.
           </p>
           <p>
            Just remember that at heart, humans are good. These videos will make you question reality, but we have each others' backs.
           </p>
           <p>
            You guy's have found the tippy tip of the iceberg. Dive down and see the entirety of it in its horror.
           </p>
           <p>
            You have been hit HARD with the truth from pizzagate. Don't suddenly just stop. Go all the way. Watch the videos. I promise I am not fucking with you.
