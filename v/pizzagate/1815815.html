<p>I can\'t pretend to know the reasoning behind Mike\'s claim that pizzagate is an &quot;obvious false flag&quot;, nor why he and Tim won\'t put even 30 minutes of actual research into this crime (which they clearly have not, given the statements in this video), but could someone explain what on earth this could even mean? </p>
<p><strong>How  could pizzagate be a &quot;false flag&quot;?</strong></p>
<p>This little clip was upsetting to me on several levels. My most visceral reaction was summed up best in the comments section,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Chicken shits!!! Like putting politicians in compromising situations for later blackmail hasn\'t been going on since the beginning of time! Any reporter worth their salt would explore this serious issue. It\'s about life and death... for the most vulnerable of us! Children! Is pedo island and the Lollita express a false flag too! You couldn\'t be bothered to investigate it!?!﻿</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So often the real wisdom of The People is found in the comments sections (Voat being a prime example!), so let me use this opportunity to highlight some of the responses to this video:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>you don\'t really need to speculate much when its written in black and white like it is. has anyone read the email that\'s talking about entertainment in the form of 3 children (with their names and ages) in the hot tub? 3 children in a hot tub with grown men? could anyone shed some light on this for me? I\'m nit talking about all the emails in which they\'re talking in code. I\'m talking specifically about the aforementioned email. anyone here care to &quot;debunk&quot; that one for me?﻿ </p>
<p><strong>Shill response</strong>: <em>There was never a \'hot tub\' mentioned. Luzzatto mentioned the pool would be getting heated (it was October) so a swim would be a possibility. The invite list included about 8 women and 8 men, not just a group of men. Luzzatto is the children\'s step grandmother, so was likely just showing her pride that she has them coming over and letting her friends know a bit about them. It also lets her friends know what to expect. They may have been expecting a quiet, sophisticated dinner party for adults. This way, she lets them know there will be loud boisterous children splashing about in a pool. In that context, she was most likely being sarcastic with the use of the word \'\'entertainment\'.﻿</em></p>

<p>I\'m not a journalist, but David Seaman summed up my thoughts well today, so let me quote him:</p>

            Let's approach it from the logical side:
Fact: What they say does not make any logical sense.
           </p>
           <p>
            Fact: They have their jobs not because they are idiots. So it can be assumed they are capable to understand simple logic and reasoning.
Does anyone believe that Michael Trimm is too dumb, to understand that sending kids into a pool for an adult's man "entertainment" is something that HAS TO BE investigated in a state under the rule of law and in a healthy society?
           </p>
           <p>
            Conclusion:
They spread the lie, that #Pizzagate is not real by intention.
           </p>
           <p>
            Therefore they are covering up heinous crimes instead of exposing them.
           </p>
           <p>
            Conclusion:
They are evil people.
"Hey, we all know that there are rich people doing things they shouldn't do HA HA HA!"
Very funny, assholes!

            Pondering all of this, and I think this is so important. This may be the strongest evidence we have (?), or at least right up there. I'd like to see how many holes we can poke in the theory that this is describing what it seems to be, because our doing that will kneecap the shills &amp; keep them from being able to use talking points we've already debunked.
           </p>
           <p>
            I won't take credit for writing it, and I think I will post it in the form of a question, what have we missed? I feel like there are other bits of evidence that could be related that I'm just not remembering. And perhaps someone out there can think of more defense for the innocence of the email, which would help us too. Then we can look at what we've got, and present it as a red pill, if indeed it is as solid as it is shaping up to be.
           </p>
           <p>
            I don't think I'm the one to do editing to the piece, my brain has gone offline and it might have to do with my early history, I tend to just black out when I get too close to certain things. This email seems to have hit a nerve, and I'm not able to really work on this. I also don't know how to do a photo search. But it's possible my brain fog will clear up soon and I can revisit this, in case you're too busy.

            We need everyone asking for an open investigation and spotlight on Racine, Wisconsin. We will bring everything to light.
           </p>
           <p>
            We need to show how Racine is a small part of the bigger puzzle, and is the key to unraveling the whole rigged system. Everything is connected. It is time for people to learn the truth. We have inside information about Paul Wellstone. We have inside information about Mark Zuckerberg. We have inside information on Ashton (Chris Kutcher) and John McCain. We can show how everything is connected, but we have to get the initial domino of Racine, Wisconsin to fall.
           </p>
           <p>
            Shine the light on Racine.

            I dont think WL was even aware that there were pedophile issues lurking in the 50,000 emails, the intent was to expose the inner workings of Podesta, Hillary, the Democratic Party, Clinton Foundation, etc.

            What about adding the "raw and uncut" comment? I'm not as familiar with this part of the evidence, so until I do some more research I won't be of much help. I would highlight the part about the affair too, that's the new bit of evidence to my knowledge. I've never heard it mentioned here before. Also setting the record straight about pool versus hot tub is good.

             True. And first I was agreeing with Alex Jones with that reasoning, too.
But interestingly in the meanwhile he has dropped the scandalous Podesta emails completely and Infowars is now trying to focus on the ideological/religious backgrounds of satanic cults.
            </p>
            <p>
             And that means to direct the discussion away from the hot lead of the Podesta emails and Alefantis' Rothschild connections.
            </p>
            <p>
             Edit:
Oh, and while I'm at it:
Pay attention if someone makes an OR-argument! Investigate Podesta/Alefantis OR pedophile rings.
            </p>
            <p>
             Any honest person would say: investigate EVERYTHING that is involved! Investigating all trails is not a distraction. The EXCLUSION of trails is.

            It makes me wonder which definition of Pizzagate he's using:
           </p>
           <ul>
            <li>
             Hillary Clinton selling kids from CPP (mainstream media definition)
            </li>
            <li>
             sex slavery of children by DC elites (alternative definition)
            </li>
           </ul>
           <p>
            If he's rolling with the mainstream narrative, that HRC auctions babies from CPP, then I would consider that definition of a black flag.

             He has completely discredited himself by demanding an investigation not by the authorities (it's their job!), but from citizens before making claims!

            I think there has been some misunderstanding here re: Mike Trimm who had less than 9000 viewers for his false flag episode. He in effect argues that Pizzagate is real to the extent it applies to child sex trafficking in general but it is not real as it applies to Podesta and Alefantis and others. He is of the opinion that there is insufficient evidence to implicate these particular folks. He goes on to say that if such trafficking is CIA controlled then Pizzagate is a false flag. Well the CIA cannot possibly control all trafficking - is he talking about Alefantis/Podesta? He really doesn't make any sense to me with this false flag argument and this detracts from the efforts and findings of the research community.
           </p>
           <p>
            Regarding Alefantis/Podesta is he challenging the 
adequacy of the evidence from the point of view of conviction or arrest or further investigation by law enforcement? He needs to clarify himself because there is certainly evidence to justify putting the Alefantis crowd under scrutiny such as surveillance in order to obtain enough evidence to arrest and later convict.

           <p>
            From his commentary Mr. Trimm seems unaware of the extensive evidence unearthed since the first few weeks following the emails release as it pertains to the Alefantis/Podesta crowd to say nothing of the wealth of information unearthed about child trafficking in general. Mr. Trimm is pontificating  based upon a smidgen of data and thus his opinions are worthless and yet can harm those of us dedicated to this issue. He's a jerk, pay him no mind. At least Mr. Black had the intelligence to admit that he didn't have enough information to form an opinion.
           </p>
           <p>
            But Mr. Trimm does challenge us to find more evidence and the Pizzagate community needs to decide whether the goal is to close in on Alefantis/Podesta/Washington DC or are we to forever chase down every lead on child sex trafficking worldwide, the latter  goal being impossible in my judgment. Just what is our mission here?

             BS!
Every person with public influence that demands an investigation by cittizens and does not attack the authorities and police for not investigating #pizzagate simply is doing the evil's job.
            </p>
            <p>
             What else is needed, if a woman sends kids sent into a pool for an adult man's entertainment, that man loves sick art and "raw and uncut" webcam access to a naked baby was offered on her website?
            </p>
            <p>
             EVERY MAN WHO DOES NOT DEMAND AN IMMEDIATE INVESTIGATION BY AUTHORITIES INTO ALL THOSE PERSONS IS SCUM.
It's that simple.

             So many good points in this comment. Especially the very last one. If we are (and we are) turning the pizzagate investigation into a pedogate one, which means almost anything to do with pedophilia anywhere in the world can be included in this sub, then we have watered down the investigation to the point that it is almost meaningless. I've suggested before that we keep Pizzagate focussed on the DC crowd and Podesta emails, and let
             <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/v/pedogate">
              v/pedogate
             </a>
             be the spot for the worldwide phenomenon. The idea goes over like a dead weight. I think it's fabulous for the perps to have our subverse here be overwhelmed by details that have nothing to do with pizzagate proper. Good leads are forgotten or quickly buried, we are seemingly 100% unorganized, and have the entire establishment working against us. I'm not sure what to do.

            It's said that WL is a CIA/MOSSAD creation to control the flow of leaks against TPTB. Im starting to believe this, although it might have backfired with the PG revelations.

            This is why Racine, Wisconsin is so important. It is connected to every aspect of Pizzagate and Global Criminal Corruption, and we can show you how. We just need the spotlight to be put on Racine. It is the domino that will work better on Pizzagate and Global Criminal Corruption, and is a gateway to exposing the entire network of systemic corruption and abuse. This is why all of the leaders in Racine are suddenly resigning in a cover-up process. We can expose them all, but we need the spotlight on Racine - how else do you think Paul Ryan became so powerful? It is because of what he is covering up in his own district.

            Pizzagate sprung from DNC emails made public by Julian Assange. Therefore if pizzagate is a false flag it had to have been master-minded and launched by Julian Assange. Anyone think that's the case?

            it is not a false flag... have we lost the meaning of that phrase? Anyone who uses that term in this way is suspect to me.

            Did they take years to set up a pizza place to look like it was involved in pedophilia just in case podesta or clinton's emails were leaked and spirit cooking as well as the Clinton Foundation human trafficking were exposed? Who would want to make us believe rothschild alifantis was guilty when he wasn't?
           </p>
           <p>
            It can be argued it is a distraction, but even that is a bit idiotic since the pizzagate (and spirit cooking) story red-pilled a number of people. The shooting there was a false-flag... but the pizza place is mixed up in the oligarch's ritual sexual assault of children. with the number of missing children every year, there are probably thousands of such dark businesses around the country. Flamboyant Alifantis (baby-lover) just couldn't keep his flaming freak show private enough so he's taking the brunt...

            The government liaison of the Pew Charitable Trust announced there would be children in the heated pool for entertainment. They are going to be ubered in and here are their ages. The response was "I've never even had an affair before."  Sorry but that doesn't sound very debunked.

            It's obviously not a false flag. We've heard from victims of these horrors for years and thought they were crazy. Podesta's Wikileaked emails and Comet Ping Pong's Instragram pages and all the links discovered through these sources provided mountains of circumstantial evidence that these victims have been telling the truth about what happened to them.
           </p>
           <p>
            There are pedophiles, satanic, compromised, and otherwise, at the highest levels of our government, obviously protected by the agencies who are supposed to be protecting us from these criminals. They are also protected by the media, which is supposed to be exposing these criminals. The victimized children and direct victims of rape, torture, and murder obviously suffer the most, but we are all victims of controlled politicians who are implementing policies intended to harm us. In addition to harmful trade and border policies, our food and water supplies are tainted, many pharmaceutical drugs make us ill or addicted, our medical system seems designed to keep us chronically ill rather than healed, our schools and media are designed to keep us uninformed about what's really going on, and anyone who tries to expose or correct these things encounters a huge organized, well-funded force designed to destroy or silence them.

             Tim Black is a big youtuber, and has a big following on Twitter. Mike Trimm is not as well known, but Tim just had him as a guest on his show, so Mike's influence will likely be growing. A lot of people do listen to Trimm, he is most known for reporting on Wikileaks related matters, and broke a story about Huma being a spy, his video was so damning that he was forced to take it down. Supposedly tptb told him they would be making busts related to what  he revealed in his video, but the info couldn't be released yet. That's when I first heard of him, and when he got his street cred on Twitter. In some circles, his influence is on par with with George Webb, so I think it does deserve mention. And Tim has such a large audience that this video could potentially have a lot of viewers. Even if Mikes voice isn't huge at this time, the more and more alt voices debunk or dismiss or muddy the pizzagate waters, the harder it will be for us to get the alt community to listen to us. So I want to call them out at every turn. Mike should be made to explain himself, IMO. And he can't, so he should be embarrassed or made to do a proper Benn Swann style expose if he wants to continue calling himself an investigator.

               I get triggered even by the severe lack of knowledge, the sign that NO effort has been put forth to find out if these  sick pedos are really sick pedos. Tim had a couple people investigate for him, and yet he still thinks Comet is the pizza shop with the pedo symbol. Either we pizzagaters have done a completely shite job at getting the info out, or our alt youtube community just doesn't really give a shit about children.

                It is shocking at times to see the lack of knowledge from people who really should be all over this. Just the fact that there's only like 10000 members here, out of billions of people. Even the most popular posts only get a few thousand views if lucky. Though still don't underestimate the power pizzagate has. They're petrified of it ever becoming "real news".

                 That's the bottom line. Congress actually threatened the cable company about airing the doc about Franklin Scandal.

                 We have such a preponderance of evidence at this point, plus the fact that we are talking about children suffering in horrific ways, it is just impossible to let hope for pizzagate go. Like another commenter said here yesterday, every time he wants to just give up, he pictures the children and their pain, and his energy is renewed.

              My point wasn't that you shouldn't have posted the info. Definitely post it so we know what's going on, and just as importantly, who to trust. I don't know Black or Trimm ... or Webb for that matter -- not before pizzagate .... so for them to think I'd care laughable. As for their followers, don't know. When some advances an obvious shill narrative, it usually opens eyes, makes them think. Sometimes it confirms suspicions. I call it them having an, "Alex Jones moment." It's the moment you lose all credibility and fold like a cheap suit.

               Exactly. I'm kind of forcing the "Alex Jones moment" here. Anyone gatekeeping or hindering our efforts is going to get called out (unless they literally have no influence, then it's not worth our time).

                 There's something about letting them get away with making false claims that bothers me. I also think it opens up a good conversation. Media is always 'debunking' pizzagate and framing us however they wish, but when and where do WE get to debunk THEM, even the nobodies, in the same way? Only here, and Steemit. I also truly wanted to understand how people could refer to PG as a false flag, thinking perhaps my understanding of the term was way off. So this post answered that for me - i'm not off, those who call it a FF are. It's really in the debunking that we do in these comments that the investigation continues ( at least for me ). For instance, i didn't know that the "heated pool" email contained a remark equating it to having an affair! Someone in the comments here just said that.

                 I guess what i'm saying is this post had multiple purposes, and very little has to do with Mike Trimm per se.

                  Well, think about Bill Clinton. He denied, denied, denied, denied everything right up to the smoking gun --- the infamous blue dress. I think what makes these idiot's remarks seem authentic is the press. It's the missing component between them and us. "Them" have their words in print and legitimized while "us" come here and only validate each other through posts such as these. Yup, the press is why no one takes us seriously, because if Joe Biden really had fondled that little girl's breast, well, dadgummit, the WaPo &amp; NYT would have said so, but they didn't so he's just a friendly goofy guy and not a perv.

                   Ugggggggghhhhhh I know. At the same time, they flaunt in our faces that yes, this stuff goes on that's just the way it is. On last nights HBO "Veep", one of the congressmen after shaking another ones hand, got out the Purell and made a comment about the pedophiles sweaty hand, saying "he's ruined more children's lives than common core". It's just a joke. In the preview for next week, this same guy is shown getting excited about attending a conference on sex trafficking. He is then corrected and told its an anti sex trafficking conference. Now he's bummed. While we are being called crazy conspiracy theorists, we are simultaneously supposed to laugh at this? Rubbing it in our faces?!

                    Yes. This. I mean, WTH? But the constant parading it  in a joking fashion in front of our eyes is supposed to normalize it. Then when we hear someone talking or posting about it, like James Alefantis and his crew, we dismiss it as a joke because that's what the guy on HBO did. He was just joking so JA was just joking. No, it's not funny. If people are fined for dropping the F bomb, they should be banned from TV for joking about pedophilia.
