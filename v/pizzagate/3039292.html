<p>UNESCO (United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization) - its declared purpose is to contribute peace and security by promoting international collaboration through educational, scientific, and cultural reforms</p>
<p>Alice Bailey (1880-1949) - a writer of more than 24 books on theosophical subjects and was one of the first writers to use the term &quot;New Age.&quot;</p>
<p>Helena &quot;Madame&quot; Blavatsky (1831-1891) a Russian occultist, philosopher, and author who co-founded the Theosophical Society in 1875.</p>
<p>Julian Huxley (1887-1975) an evolutionary biologist, eugenicist, and internationalist and a proponent of natural selection</p>
<p>Robert Muller (1923-2010) - an international civil servant with the UN, known as &quot;the philosopher of the United Nations.&quot;</p>
<p>Bill Gates (1955-) - an American business magnate, investor, author, philanthropist, and humanitarian and principal founder of Microsoft Corporation</p>
<p>These organizations and people are grave threats and are our mortal enemies.</p>
<p>It\'s 1949 , and here is UNESCO\'s Political and One-World Philosophy:</p>
<p>&quot;As long as the child breathes the poisoned air of nationalism, education in world-mindedness can produce only rather precarious results. As we have pointed out, it is frequently the family that infects the child with extreme nationalism. The school should therefore use the means described earlier to combat family attitudes that favor jingoism...We shall presently recognise in nationalism the major obstacle to development of world-mindedness. We are at the beginning of a long process of breaking down the wall of sovereignty. UNESCO must be the pioneer.&quot;</p>
<p>Enter Bill Gates - to promote their agenda through COMMON CORE, and Gates is the primary pusher. In February 2014, Microsoft joined Pearson, the world\'s largest educational publisher, to load Pearson\'s Common Core classroom materials on Microsoft\'s tablet, the Surface. That product allowed Microsoft to compete for school district spending with Apple, whose iPad was the dominant tablet in classrooms.</p>

<p>Enter Julian Huxley - who served as the first head of UNESCO from 1946-1948. He ws the brother of &quot;Brave New World author,&quot; Aldous Huxley. He was devoted to eugenics, stating that the human race must encourage &quot;genetically defective or inferior types from breeding,&quot; calling for the &quot;regulation and control of human numbers,&quot; in addition to a &quot;world population policy.&quot; Huxley believed that UNESCO should pay a pivotal role in advancing the cause of eugenics.</p>

<p>Enter Robert Muller - &quot;the father of global education,&quot; who has been extremely influential in world education through UNESCO. Robert Muller - Secretary-General of the UN\'s Economic and Social Council, founder of Robert Muller School of Ageless Wisdom in Arlington, TX, helped establish the University of Peace in Costa Rica, from which came the International Educational Goals founded on the teachings of Alice Bailey (will get to that later), the curriculum for the School of Ageless Wisdom is now COMMON CORE. Muller received the UNESCO Peace Prize in 1989 for his World Core Curriculum taught in his School of Ageless Wisdom.</p>
<p>&quot;Steer our children toward global citizenship, earth-centered beliefs, socialist values, and the collective mindset which is becoming a requirement for the 21st century workforce.&quot; -Robert Muller</p>
<p><a href="http://www.unesco.org/education/tlsf/mods/theme_c/popups/mod18t01s03.html">http://www.unesco.org/education/tlsf/mods/theme_c/popups/mod18t01s03.html</a></p>
<p>The underlying philosophy upon which Muller\'s school was founded was from the teachings set forth in Alice Bailey\'s books and by a Tibetan teacher, Djwhal Khul. Khul believed he was an &quot;Ascended Master,&quot; an enlightened one.</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Djwal_Khul">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Djwal_Khul</a></p>
<p>Enter Alice Bailey - the founder of the Lucis Trust (once known as Lucifer Trust). The Lucis Trust Association is a UN affiliated NGO which achieved consultative status with the UN in 1989. The Lucis Trust was established in 1922 as The Lucifer Trust by Alice Bailey as a publishing company to disseminate her books and the books of the Theosophical Society. The Theosophical Society\'s influence today seems to be confined to the education (or re-education) for those seeking alternatives to Western religion.</p>
<p>Enter Helena Blavatsky - The Theosophical Society and Godmother of the New Aage Movement. Here are some of her quotes:</p>
<p>&quot;Lucifer is the Logos...the Serpent, the Savior.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It is Satan who is the God of our planet and the only God.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;The Celestial Virgin which thus becomes the Mother of Gods and Devils at one and the same time..Lucifer is..\'the Holy Ghost\' and \'Satan&quot; at one and the same time.&quot;</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helena_Blavatsky">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helena_Blavatsky</a></p>
<p>The Lucis Trust is aggressively involved in promoting a globalist ideology, which it refers to as &quot;goodwill.&quot; Its &quot;World Goodwill&quot; organization is closely connected to international elitist circles. Judging from its political writings appearing in its publications, it is as much a political organization as an occult religious one.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.lucistrust.org/">https://www.lucistrust.org/</a></p>
<p>Alice Bailey said when you are changing a nation, don\'t bother with the old people, they are too stuck in their traditions, they will not change, but &quot;GO FOR THE CHILDREN, especially 10 years and below.&quot;</p>
<p>She then created this 10 POINT CHARTER</p>
<p>Take God and Prayer out of the education system (Done)</p>
<p>Reduce parental authority over the children (Done)</p>
<p>Destroy the Judeo-Christian family structure or the traditional Christian family structure (Done)</p>
<p>If sex is free, then make abortion legal, and make it easy (Done)</p>
<p>Make divorce easy and legal, free people from the concept of marriage for life (Done)</p>
<p>Make homosexuality an alternative lifestyle (DOne)</p>
<p>Debase art, make it run mad (Done)</p>
<p>Use media to promote and change mindset (Done)</p>
<p>Create an Interfaith movement (Done)</p>
<p>Get governments to make all these laws and get the Church to endorse these changes</p>
<p><a href="https://plannedpurity.files.wordpress.com/2013/06/the_tenpoint_plan_of_the_new_world_order-1.pdf">https://plannedpurity.files.wordpress.com/2013/06/the_tenpoint_plan_of_the_new_world_order-1.pdf</a></p>
<p>In 2016, Bill Gates called for &quot;a kind of global government&quot; saying that the UN doesn\'t have enough power and must be granted full governmental control &quot;for the good of humanity.&quot; He stated that a global government was &quot;badly needed.&quot;</p>
<p><a href="https://nworeport.me/2016/12/07/bill-gates-humanity-badly-needs-one-world-government/">https://nworeport.me/2016/12/07/bill-gates-humanity-badly-needs-one-world-government/</a></p>
<p>On the Lucis Trust website, the books of Alice Bailey are available and easily accessible. Take for instance &quot;The Work of the Christ Today and in the Future - Part 1.&quot; Here are some passages:</p>
<p>Christ has been for two thousand years a silent passive Figure, hidden behind a multitude of words written by a multitude of men (commentators and preachers)...Our study of the future work of the Christ is necessarily based upon 3 assumptions:</p>
<p>That the reappearance of the Christ is inevitable and assured.</p>
<p>That He is today and has been actively working - through the medium of the spiritual Hierarchy of our planet, of which He is the Head - for the welfare of humanity.</p>
<p>That certain teachings will be given and certain engines will be released by Him in the routine of His work and coming...</p>
<p>This is a definite call for a &quot;New Messiah.&quot;</p>
<p>Bailey further states: &quot;The work and the teaching of the Christ will be hard for the Christian world to accept, though easier assimilation in the East. Nevertheless, some hard blow or some difficult presentation of the truth is badly needed if the Christian world is to be awakened and if Christian people are to recognise their place within a worldwide divine revelation and see Christ as representing all the faiths and taking His rightful place as World Teacher. He is the WORLD teacher and not a Christian teacher...They may not call Him Christ, but they have their own name for Him and follow Him as truly and faithfully as their Western brethren.&quot;</p>
<p><a href="https://www.lucistrust.org/online_books/the_reappearance_the_christ/chapter_four_the_work_the_christ_today_and_in_the_future_part1">https://www.lucistrust.org/online_books/the_reappearance_the_christ/chapter_four_the_work_the_christ_today_and_in_the_future_part1</a></p>
<p>A branch-off of Lucis Trust is &quot;The New Group of World Servers,&quot; described as follows:</p>
<p>Men of goodwill who cooperate form part of the New Group of World Servers which is working to implement the Plan. The leaders of this group are those who initiate and carry forward activities which benefit humanity as a whole...Behind these leaders and the cooperating men of goodwill are the Custodians of the Plan, \'the inner spiritual Government of the Planet...\' The New Group of World Servers are gathered from all branches of human enterprise...These world servers are the men and women who have an international vision...they know exactly what they seek to do...they will conform to and accept the situation in which they find themselves...They can be regarded as the embodiment of the emerging kingdom of God on earth, but it should be remembered that this kingdom is not a Christian kingdom or an earthly government...</p>
<p>People in the world at this time can be divided into four groups:</p>
<p>First, the uninformed masses</p>
<p>Second, the middle classes</p>
<p>Third, the thinkers everywhere</p>
<p>Fourth, the New Group of World Servers</p>

          <p>
           This is a definite call for a "New Messiah."
          </p>
          <p>
           Bailey further states: "The work and the teaching of the Christ will be hard for the Christian world to accept, though easier assimilation in the East. Nevertheless, some hard blow or some difficult presentation of the truth is badly needed if the Christian world is to be awakened and if Christian people are to recognise their place within a worldwide divine revelation and see Christ as representing all the faiths and taking His rightful place as World Teacher. He is the WORLD teacher and not a Christian teacher...They may not call Him Christ, but they have their own name for Him and follow Him as truly and faithfully as their Western brethren."

           A branch-off of Lucis Trust is "The New Group of World Servers," described as follows:
          </p>
          <p>
           Men of goodwill who cooperate form part of the New Group of World Servers which is working to implement the Plan. The leaders of this group are those who initiate and carry forward activities which benefit humanity as a whole...Behind these leaders and the cooperating men of goodwill are the Custodians of the Plan, 'the inner spiritual Government of the Planet...' The New Group of World Servers are gathered from all branches of human enterprise...These world servers are the men and women who have an international vision...they know exactly what they seek to do...they will conform to and accept the situation in which they find themselves...They can be regarded as the embodiment of the emerging kingdom of God on earth, but it should be remembered that this kingdom is not a Christian kingdom or an earthly government...
          </p>
          <p>
           People in the world at this time can be divided into four groups:
          </p>
          <p>
           First, the uninformed masses
          </p>
          <p>
           Second, the middle classes
          </p>
          <p>
           Third, the thinkers everywhere
          </p>
          <p>
           Fourth, the New Group of World Servers

            I agree with your research &amp; analysis, unfortunately for the NWO though, the real Christ, JESUS CHRIST is now playing his TRUMP card and we are indeed at the dawn of a new age.... but it isn't the one the New Agers have anticipated, it is the kingdom of God. What a time to be alive.

            The "New Messiah" appears to be Maitreya, who was heavily promoted by the now-deceased Benjamin Creme and his Share Internation project:
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             According to Benjamin Creme, The Ascended Masters live in a dimension that hovers over the Gobi Desert (Shamballa), are led by Sanat Kumara
             <strong>
              [any goats good at anagrams?]
             </strong>
             , which Theosophist Dane Rudyar referred to as "King Satan." The world has been continually infiltrated by Theosophists, with what they believe to be consciousness-altering "light" in order to prepare us for the unity necessary to receive Sanat Kumara as our world leader and true spiritual identity. The next expected avatar who will bridge the gap between western and eastern mysticism will supposedly be Maitreya, who is one of the higher Kumaras, who will usher in the wide reception of Sanat Kumara.
            </p>
            <p>
             Creme says that the aspect of God that we aspire to is the Logos of our planet, who is embodied for us as Sanat Kumara, on Shamballa. He is our "Father ....In the coming age many, many people will see God as Sanat Kumara and take the third initiation ....When you take the third initiation you see God, as Sanat Kumara, the Lord of the world, who is a real physical being in etheric matter on Shamballa." (Reappearance of Christ and The Masters of Wisdom, p. 135)
            </p>
           </blockquote>
           <p>
            Regarding Maitreya:
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             Day of Declaration
            </p>
            <p>
             At the earliest possible moment, Maitreya will demonstrate His true identity. On the Day of Declaration, the international television networks will be linked together, and Maitreya will be invited to speak to the world.
            </p>
            <p>
             We will see His face on television, but each of us will hear His words telepathically in our own language as Maitreya simultaneously impresses the minds of all humanity. Even those who are not watching Him on television will have this experience.
            </p>
            <p>
             At the same time, hundreds of thousands of spontaneous healings will take place throughout the world. In this way we will know that this man is truly the World Teacher for all humanity.

            One of the prominent Theosophists was also a pedophile, Charles Webster Leadbeater. There was a critical book
            <em>
             Madame Blavatsky's Baboon
            </em>
            (she had a stuffed baboon), this is from a reviewer of that book at U. of Michigan:
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             But the women have not been entirely alone in their mystic fane. There was, in those days (the fin de siécle), a love that dared not speak its name, but  was,  even  so,  hot  to  trot.
             <strong>
              Enter  the  pedophile  and  psychopathic  liar
Charles Webster Leadbeater
             </strong>
             , whose biopic might more suitably be filmed by  Ken  Russell.  Leadbeater’s  account  of  his  own  early  life  is,  like Blavatsky’s and Gurdjieff’s official CVs, a parcel of succulent lies, but the life the lies were designed to camouflage was just as juicy. Pedophilia was to  be,  more  than  once,  the  spur  to  travel,  both  before  and  after  Leadbeater’s ascension to the rank of bishop in the Liberal Catholic Church, an apostate institution in which bishoprics were to be had for the asking. Liberal  Catholics  chiefly  believed  in  candles, incense,  and  glitzy  vestments, along with Atlantis, Mu, and all that is divinely decadent. It was an enduring  tradition.  In  the  early  sixties  I  came  upon  a  remnant  of  the creed, one Bishop Itkin, who was often noted, in the newspapers of the day,  for  his  prominent  episcopal  presence  at  rallies  of  the  peace  movement.  Like  Leadbeater,  Itkin  found  that  if  you  called  yourself  a  bishop and wore a pectoral cross you would be treated with the same deference as the genuine article, both by the media and by altar boys. Leadbeater  is  the  Mr.  Micawber  of  Madame  Blavatsky’s  Baboon, a  deliciously predictable reprobate and opportunist. In the course of his career he  scored  at  least  as  well  as  Father  Bruce  Ritter  in  our  own  era.  He  was disgraced  repeatedly,  but  he  would  just  expatriate  himself  and  keep  on scoring. Theosophy, by shrugging off a moral code, possessed a special attraction for homosexuals who wanted to love both God and man. Now that  the  more  liberal  Protestant  churches  have  welcomed  homosexuals into the ranks of the clergy, gays of a religious bent need not venture as far afield as Theosophy to enjoy the rites and consolations of the Christian faith. Only time will tell if Theosophy is strong enough to survive that loss.
            </p>
            <p>
             <strong>
              Leadbeater’s penchant for ephebes leads to the next, and most amazing  biopic  opportunity  of  this  history—Krishnamurti.  “One  evening  in the spring of 1909,” Washington recounts, “Leadbeater noticed an extra-ordinary  aura  surrounding  one  of  the  Indian  boys  paddling  in  the  shallows. The boy was dirty and unkempt . . . . The boy took his fancy, and within days Leadbeater had told his followers that this child was destined to be a great teacher. . . .”
             </strong>
            </p>
            <p>
             The charm of Krishnamurti’s story is much  like that of the movie Forrest Gump, a fairy tale in which a simpleton, after only a little adversity, is blessed with all possible blessings because his heart is pure. Leadbeater intuited  that  young  Krishna,  known  in  the  spirit  realm  as  Alcyone,  had lived  thirty  lives  already,  ranging  in  time  from  22662 B.C to A.D. 624, which  Leadbeater  began  to  chronicle  in  the  pages  of  The  Theosophist: “It turned out that in each of these thirty lives everyone else known to Leadbeater also figured, but with different identities and sometimes different sexes. Some had been famous historical characters. Others had lived on the moon and Venus.” Alcyone’s long saga became the means by which Leadbeater  revenged  himself  on  old  enemies  and  theosophical  rivals. Thus, in an earlier life, Mrs. Besant (in this life, too, a serial monogamist) “acquired  twelve  husbands  for  whom  she  roasted  rats.”  Another  Leadbeater scoop: Julius Caesar’s marriage to Jesus Christ. The bishop could out-tabloid even the Weekly World News, and in this he prefigured the can-you-top-this spirituality  of  our  own  era,  in  which  sheer  imagination  is confused with causality. Such fads as creative visualization, UFO abductions, and incest survivalism
             <strong>
              [!!]
             </strong>
             all conflate dreams and matters-of-fact, and they are licensed to do so by the intellectual deference long accorded to crackpot religions. Leadbeater’s tales of his divine Alcyone soon put the teenage Krishnamurti on the theosophical map. Mrs. Besant adopted “Krishna” and his sibling,  Nitya,  transported  them  to  London,  and  put  them  on  a  new dietary regimen of porridge, eggs, and milk. Leadbeater, a fanatic about good hygiene, personally attended their daily ablutions.
             <strong>
              The boys’ father sued   for   repossession   of   his   offspring, charging Leadbeater  with “deification and sodomy.”
             </strong>
             That is only the beginning of Krishnamurti’s golden legend. By the sound of it, he was a rather nice fellow, his Godhead notwithstanding—a bit like Bertie Wooster in his happy blindness to his own astonishing privilege.

            I'll repost a comment I made on a JoG posting:

           <p>
            Sedona is a New Age hotspot, known as an 'energy vortex', and I'm sure a beautiful spot.

            It would be interesting to know when the John of God center was active and when de Faria himself  visited there.
           </p>
           <p>
            Apparently there's a big intersection between Globalism and the New Age. There was guy in the UK, Benjamin Creme, who promoted Maitreya, a New Age Christ to replace all religions living incognito in London. Sounds like a crackpot but...

             ] is clearly obvious in each issue that is published. Despite this fact, or perhaps because of it, SI has a long list of prominent, well respected international diplomats, religious leaders and political figures who have had articles published in this magazine.

             I believe the promotion of Maitreya was incorporated before Creme came along, either by Blavatsky, Bailey's teacher, the Tibetan monk, or even before these 3.  Maitreya is an important figure in Buddhism.  He is considered to be the bodhisattva who will come to earth someday and enlighten all beings, similar to Christians believing Jesus Christ will do.  The Blavatsky's, Bailey's, Creme's, etc., got caught up in all of this, formulating "The Plan" to suit their agenda or whatever you want to call it, and here we are.  In Buddhist belief, I don't believe the concept of Maitreya was meant to connote that a Messiah-type individual would be "appointed" - the same way Christians believe that Jesus Christ would be a mortal when he returns.

              Yes, but I'm talking about Benjamin Creme's Maitreya, an actual Indian or Pakistani man in London. He is tapping into these traditions.
             </p>
             <p>
              Creme's Maitreya can shape-shift and get around. His newsletter would be full of "Reader: I saw a strange old lady last Wednesday." "Creme: That was Maitreya!". He also has a special star, so readers would report UFO sightings and Creme would say it was the star.
             </p>
             <p>
              Sounds like a lunatic but he actually had a lot of heavy-hitters write articles for his magazine.

             Another comment about Alice Bailey relevant here:
             <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/v/pizzagate/3032019/16760885">
              https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/3032019/16760885
             </a>
            </p>
            <p>
             I'm going off on a tangent, but: H.P. Blavatsky and her successor Alice Bailey were not quite mediums, they communicated consciously with living supernatural personages in the Himalayas. Bailey had a concept of 'externalization of the hierarchy', that this hierarchy of entities should be revealed and rule the planet. Creme was influenced by these and others and also got telepathic messages. He organized transmission meditations, his followers around the world would meditate at the same time to send healing energy. So they are not quite mediums in the sense of Joao de Deus's spirit possession; there's some parallel with the group meditation.

            Explains a lot. Well compiled. This type of narrative needs to become mainstream. The shift IS happening through our waking up and getting educated of such beliefs.
