<p>Never hearing of this guy and coming across him by accident, sent my mind in a turmoil very quickly.  This guy is either a lunatic, a genius, an elite, a whistleblower, a liar, the real deal or all of this combined and much more.</p>
<p>This is pizzagate relevant in many pizzagate respects as Illuminati = Pizzagate=Illuminati, whatever, and at this point, I think we can all agree.</p>
<p>I am just going to highlight some of the info I found on Zagami.  Much of his personal history is sketchy, and what has been printed about it is repetitive.  Other articles about his career run the gamut from Grand Master of Ordo Illuminatorum Universalis, to record producer to author, to his current whistleblower status and to his possibly living in a sort of exile in Oslo, Norway.</p>
<p>Keep in mind, the information found is controversial, just like Zagami. Found one reference to his birth date - March 5, 1970, perhaps in Rome, to an aristocratic Scottish-Sicilian bloodline.  
</p>
<p>In 2006, it is said he became very popular on the web because of his direct involvement in the NWO and Illuminati.</p>
<p>He was described in one article as the &quot;real deal.&quot; Even in skeptical articles, it is admitted that he is a controversial character, allegedly a lifetime member (and his entire family) of just about every western secret society you can think of - several freemasonry rites (33rd degree), order of Malta, Ordo Illuminatorum Universalis to name a few. It is said that in the early 2000\'s he moved in many strange and powerful circles and had an entourage of bodyguards. It is said that he knows religions like the back of his hand.</p>
<p>In 2008, he decided to become a whistleblower about western secret societies by revealing his strength as an occult historian.  It is said that much of the material in his 3 volumes is detailed and verifiable.</p>
<p>One other book he co-authored that may be of interest published in 2015, is &quot;Pope Francis: The Last Pope?  Money, Masons, and Occultism in the Decline of the Catholic Church.&quot;</p>',

            Common sense:  Nobody goes around for YEARS, telling us and showing us WHERE HE LIVES, claiming to "expose Illuminati secrets."  If he was really exposing anything, this guy would have been dead years ago.

            Zagami is a representative of one faction of the elite, and the elite factions war with each other through the media.  I believe that's the filter to apply when researching him and any other elite spokesperson.

            <p>
             Negative.  We are not privy to elite wars.

             The media is a theatrical production for the sheeple.  The only "duking it out" you see on TV is for DRAMATIC EFFECT because it gets higher ratings because sheeple LOVE drama.
