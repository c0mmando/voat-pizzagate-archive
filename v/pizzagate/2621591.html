<p>MESA, AZ - A Mesa man is accused of molesting two girls in his neighborhood. </p>
<p>Mesa Police say that they were contacted by a school who reported to them that a pre-teen girl had accused her neighbor of molesting her. </p>
<p>During the investigation, a second teenage girl came forward and accused 21-year-old Carlos Joseph McCain of molesting her as well. </p>
<p>McCain is also accused of showing pornography to one of the girls on his phone and tablet. </p>
<p>Upon his arrest, McCain allegedly told police that he did these things because the girls were curious about sex. </p>
<p>McCain has access to other children as he listed his profession as a school bus driver in the Tempe Union High School District. However, there is no indication that these incidents are related to his employment. The school district says, &quot;His supervisor and HR have been told of his arrest and we will take appropriate action when the district opens on Monday.&quot;</p>
<p>He was arrested the next day at his home, for child molestation and providing obscene material to minors.</p>
<p>No where are our kids safe .  I’m concerned about his past.</p>

            besides the (no-name) surname, i'm not seeing anything that connects this pedo to the 'elite.'  (see Rule 1, in the sidebar)

            McCain?  This is unreal.  Any relation to John you know who?  Wow.  That's really odd.   School bus driver?  They are never vetted.  They are not little old lady drivers anymore.  Evidently they did not check his past record.  If he had CP on his tablet this is not his first time.  Sick.

             How do you know he was not vetted? I will wait for your reply with the information.
            </p>
            <p>
             Do you know if he had something in his past that would preclude him from employment as a school bus driver? Again, I will wait for yur reply with proof.
            </p>
            <p>
             Article says nothing about a past criminal history. Why is it unreal that he has the last last name of a politician? A quick Google search show the 2010 Census listing 19,000 people in the U.S with the last name McCain. While you are replying with your facts to my previous questions, please explain further why it is odd his last name is McCain.
            </p>
            <p>
             I in no way, shape or form condone what he did. Nor do I condone of someone posting an innuendo or spewing information that has zero basis.
            </p>
            <p>
             You know how people are sick of fake news? Well, I am sick of bullsh*t posts as well.

              Shut Up.  With the same last name as John McCain and it is in Az then why is it wrong to ask if there is a connection?  I did not say he was related, I asked if he was.  Where have you been as far as watching and reading news reports about sex abuse and school workers?  There has been a huge problem with not vetting teachers, coaches and lunch room workers AND bus drivers for schools.  They are doing a very bad job of not vetting these people.  That's my answer.
