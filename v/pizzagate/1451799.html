            According to Sibel Edmonds videos in another post (which she has been saying for years) the judiciary is corrupted. Crimes cannot be brought to court if no judge will convict. There are other posts detailing the corruption in the US &amp; Canadian Family Court systems. Trump seems to be appointing a cabinet that will continue the status quo, (unless he is setting them up to fail), but he will need to replace much of the Judiciary to clean up the corruption. I think that our best chance of justice is if actual evidence is found/leaked and the worst of them are forced to resign.

            You guys are bumming me out! I'm praying this time it's different! This time we have this researcher/citizen journalist/hacker collaboration movement going on, with real evidence and real links. Hopefully the change in the White House makes a difference too! I'm praying things will really change this time!

            The whole house isn't going to fall without top rank whistleblower. At the most they will just use couple of scapegoats and that's it. Happened many times before, around the world.

            Trump is placing neocon Zionists, Goldman Sachs bankers, torture advocates and surveillance state advocates into all of his key positions.    I am skeptical that he is going to do anything about this.   This isn't a "liberal vs conservative" issue.

             Sorry, I definitely wasn't trying to say it was a right/left thing by bringing up Hillary supports. Just meant that they will be so shell shocked, cause they see her and everyone involved so differently than those of us that know the truth.

              I agree, left/right, racism, antisemitism, antimuslim, local gang behavior is all divide and conquer tactics to divert and distract, to keep the people from unifying against their real "enemy" who is anyone subverting the constitution through secrets, "free trade" (arms, drugs humans etc), unlawful surveillance and seizure, and manipulation of the media.

            no. there will be a couple fall guys that get pinched, if that, to satisfy the public. the rest of the satanic cult will be labeled a conspiracy theory and the public will continue to believe what they are told.
           </p>
           <p>
            it will definitely go further than the satanic cult hysteria of the 80s thanks to our technology, but as for it all coming down? we'd need a whistleblower from the inside, not a child who was abused we've already had hundreds of those, someone who did the abusing, which isn't going to happen.
