Most of the parents said that doctors or nurses told them that their babies had died, but refused to let them see the bodies. Many of the parents believe their babies were stolen by hospital staff and then sold to adoptive parents. The police have said they can\'t investigate because the statute of limitations has expired. Last October, the Serbian government proposed compensating the parents 10,000 Euros for their loss, but the parents don\'t want to accept the proposal, fearing the police won\'t bother to investigate if they can just pay off the parents. Serbian Ombudsman Sasa Jankovic said in a report in 2010 that a lack of proper documentation made it impossible to determine whether a crime had been committed. A working group set up by the government in 2011 said it couldn\'t investigate the cases of the missing babies unless the state constitution was amended. The article doesn\'t specify why a constitutional amendment is necessary.</p>

<p>In Nov. 2014, the Union of Parents of Missing Babies of Serbia tracked down the 75th newborn suspected stolen from its parents.

            Kosovo. This is HRC on the world stage. Slaughter happened in Serbia. This also where Dyncorp (CIA) fully implemented picking winners and losers. Massive Organ Harvesting. I believe George Webb stated he was an eye witness to this horror.

            Have you seen that movie 'A Serbian Film' it plays as torture porn fiction but is best read as a documentary IMO. It contains a scene where a newborn baby is raped and a scene where the villain explains that child trafficking is the bread and butter of the Serbian economy.

             I wouldn't call it a documentary. It's more an allegory about how the Western states violated Serbia's national sovereignty by stripping Kosovo away from it. Most Serbs consider Kosovo to be the cradle of their civilization. The film draws heavily upon medieval Serbian poetry centered around Kosovo.

             I know three people who have seen that film. Two were hard core horror fans- the type of people who seek out banned and rare extreme horror. The third was in the medical field and regularly handled dead bodies. All three people said they were deeply psychologically scarred by watching the movie and said no one should ever watch it.

            Wow! Great find. I am convinced Kosovo has a lot to hide. Their President, as you probably already knowwas investigated and found to be trafficking organs.

            EDIT: For those who dont know, Kosovo was once part of Serbia, until the Clinton administration aided a revolution headed by Hashim Thaci, a known trafficker of human organs.

             and scroll almost halfway down the page, there are two leaked NATO reports (posted on April 4, 2011) about organized crime in Kosovo, showing links between various clans and the mafia.
