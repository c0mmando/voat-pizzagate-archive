            I think its also wise to not be so naive to think that celebrities and others who are "a success" in this world are necessarily clueless about Make-A-Wish. For instance, I posted earlier today about Rob Dyrdek who had a connection to a suspected pizza shop that formed a pizza map symbol of a penis with testicles and Tosh O did a spoof video portraying Dyrdek as a pedophile. See the following post for the Tosh O video and a link to his last show at the "Fun Factory" where he brings in a big group of children from Make-A-Wish.

            People who support groups that are outed as high-likelihood fronts for pedophilia rings should be considered suspect until proven otherwise. Raising eyebrows without convicting.

            I am so afraid of donating to any organization that claims to be "for the children" after all of this... Shit is seriously bad for my ulcers. Every time I get back into the investigation, more of these crop up- this one being one of the most well-known, and just as insidious and disgusting as the rest. Even dying children aren't safe for their last moments. I feel like crying again.

             Oh shit, I forgot about that! Yeah, I forgot to mention elsewhere that I have seen that logo around before. If staff members are complicit, it's got to be a really small, tight-knit group for a hospital like that. A lot of people (like my recently redpilled as fuck mom-and she did that before I even mentioned it, which is a good sign the right info is spreading) used to work at hospitals as a nurse and she'd lose her mind if she knew that kind of shit was going on. She (nor I) had ever even seen the FBI pedophile symbols before this investigation, so I wonder how many people could possibly be complicit.. Scary. Always stay with your loved ones recovering in the hospital.. I was always afraid of pathological angels of death or just outright malpractice, but this takes evil hospital bullshit to a whole other level..

            Think about what kind of organization would be attractive to a pedophile. Lots of kids extremely vulnerable children available. check. Reduced risk of criminal conviction because victims would likely be dead before any complaint was made, and would almost certainly be dead before testifying in court. check mate.

            Someone needs to dig into this further. What was the timing between Menses leaving Anglicare and his being hired as CEO of Make-A-Wish? Who hired him? Do those who hired him have any connections to the "Pedocracy"? Dig harder, people.

            This is disgusting at best.  Menses covered up for someone he knew was a pedophile.  The guy was nude bathing with a 10 yr old boy and not only did he cover it up, he coached him on giving answers to protect both of them.  That was at Anglicare.  Now he is CEO of Make A Wish.  Another organization bites the dust?  We shall see.  They must be pressured into making him step down.  Immediately.
