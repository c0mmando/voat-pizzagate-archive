<p>The Hawaii public employee who plunged the state into chaos by accidentally sending out an incoming-missile emergency alert Saturday has been reassigned, according to reports.</p>
<p>The unnamed emergency department worker will not be fired because he made an honest mistake, Hawaii Emergency Management Agency spokesman Richard Rapoza told the Washington Post.</p>
<p>“Part of the problem was it was too easy — for anyone — to make such a big mistake,” Rapoza said. “We have to make sure that we’re not looking for retribution, but we should be fixing the problems in the system. … I know that it’s a very, very difficult situation for him.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yeah, I don\'t know if it was that easy. Especially considering this: </p>

<p><a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/hawaii-missile-alert-emergency-management-system-false-ballistic-missile-warning-2018-1-13/">https://www.cbsnews.com/news/hawaii-missile-alert-emergency-management-system-false-ballistic-missile-warning-2018-1-13/</a></p>
<p>Miyagi and Ige said they will be implementing changes to make sure it won\'t be a single individual and it will be at least two people sending out the alert. But Miyagi said there is a screen that says &quot;are you sure you want to do this?&quot;  
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>ARE YOU SURE YOU WANT TO DO THIS? You see that flash before your eyes and you go ahead with sending out a false alert anyway? Is this starting to sound like the Twitter worker who deleted Trump\'s account? Yeah, I didn\'t believe that either. Then there\'s Mr. Potato Head Dave FlintstonePodesta\'s hot dog stand. One other thing makes it unlikely that it was a simple accident. From the same link above: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Although Ige said no one had authorized the use of the sirens, there were sirens. </p>

<p>So where\'d the sirens come from then? Wouldn\'t the unleashing of sirens mean this was planned? </p>
<p>Hawaii is on my radar. With the info I posted about the Paul Mitchell Estate coupled with the fake birth certificate, I\'d say there\'s something going on besides luaus on the beach. Question is what. Is this in retaliation? Was it a show of power? Was it a warning? All of the above? </p>

            Robert David Steele said Clinton’s and Huma were there for a alibi. People on boats have said there was a missile and it went down in the ocean. Clinton’s were up to nothing good as usual.

            There's a very good chance that Hillary's presence there a day before the false flag missle alert is even further evidence of her involvement. However, it's also worth considering perhaps this was an organized hack/threat on behalf on the Trump administration because of Clinton, Huma, and the CIA general head quarters being in Hawaii at the same time.
           </p>
           <p>
            With all of the cryptic like behavior were seeing from Julian Assange, Q, Sessions, and Trump it would not surprise me if this attack was some how from the Trump administration and used to possibly scare the shit out of who ever was in Hawaii. Just a thought.

             Appreciate the theory, but Trump would never do that School kids were scared out of their minds.

             Not sure what it was, but it was planned. The sirens going off without authorization prove that.

            False alarm was really an alert to Clintons and toadies to take cover from incoming trouble.

               Yeah, I hear you and think something did take place. They've gotta be preparing for contingencies because things are moving fast (yeah, not for me! Ha!), and they've gotta get their stories straight. Haven't had the chance to try to dig into where he stayed and whether it was in Huma's room (if the room is a rockin', don't come a'knockin'!)

             Researchers need to dig on their employees that are the triggermen. Expose them. If the hired guns know they will hit the spotlight it will be hard for the crime family to find shooters to work for them.

             It didn't amongst us, but among the alt-left. Didn't you see Jamie Lee Curtis' tweet about this all being his fault for being so arrogant?

             Then this morning I saw one ... actually, let me try to find it because it made absolutely no sense! &gt;

              Trump knew within minutes no missile was hurtling toward Hawaii. He was golfing. They told him. He did not tweet out that info. He kept golfing. People thought they &amp; their families were going to die FOR 38 MINS. Then when the panic was over he tweeted how media is so mean to him

            <p>
             Yes, the idiot that tweeted this uses the word 'genius" as his twitter handle. Really? The basis for this is his admonishing our POTUS for not tweeting? Earth to clueless wonder: If our POTUS had tweeted, the same people receiving the broadcast wouldn't receive the tweet. It's two different sources so the error would need to be corrected through the same alert broadcasting system.
            </p>
            <p>
             Yikes!
            </p>
            <p>
             Anyway, one of the alt-right tweeters made reference to this being used to humiliate our POTUS so that's what I was picking up on. It's wasn't a commentary from me nor did I think he was humiliated since he had nothing to do with it.

              This is an incredibly poor argument.  Americans thought they were under nuclear attack due to a mistake.  The President learned it was a mistake and did nothing.  Twitter is not the emergency broadcast system, but they do get it in Hawaii.  He could have also called the news or communicated this in a variety of ways.
