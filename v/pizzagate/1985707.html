            It's surprising how many people have been in the system on a more brief or intermittent basis. People we don't think of as "system kids" or who don't usually identify as foster kids if they were reunited with a family member or relative.

            I was in the system for less than a year. Involved w/ cps off and on my whole childhood. we should have been taken. we were almost always given back within a few days. My mom tried to commit suicide 6 times by the time I left home. My dad is bipolar. We should have never been brought back to that house but it happened over and over. I never understood why but it is true that they were dirt poor and HIGH maintenance.

             It always surprises me these horror stories of kids being taken from good parents because it always seemed to me that there was NOTHING my parents could do that would get us removed. SO while they focus on safe kids unsafe kids are being ignored as well.
