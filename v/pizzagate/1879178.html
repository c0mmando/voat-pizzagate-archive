<p>pitenius was the only reply I had received and he/she stated, *&quot;So, you didn\'t get any replies. I don\'t know that I have any great answers.</p>
<p>I\'m not convinced that the occultism is real. I mean, I bet it happens. We\'ve all seen &quot;Spirit Cooking&quot; but I don\'t trust that the people doing it have any belief. I suspect, like most modern people, they are atheists and this is &quot;art&quot; or a funny gag. If you imagine that these groups have been at it for ages (not in a direct chain but through a web of associated players), you can produce a different story. As late as the 1950s, participation in such rituals may have been blackmailable. I know it still is among Muslims (and, yes, there are Satan worshiping cults and there are frequent charges of witchcraft among politicians -- Qaddafi springs to mind). So, if dark oaths bonded people in the 1800s, and drug use ensured loyalty until the 1980s, child sex seems to be a logical next step. I have a bit of experience with one occult group in the US that always wants money, and pictures of its members doing drugs or fucking people. They\'re reasonably common, but in my experience singularly terrible, arrogant people.</p>
<p>So, back to your questions:</p>
<p>1) Why would these occult groups simply go out and leave symbolism of there existence in different areas of our nation.</p>
<p>The answer depends on whether you accept them as dedicated occultists or cynical atheists. In the first case, check the literature on sigil magick. They\'re claiming territory, extending their brand, and integrating themselves into the psychic landscape. In the second case, they\'re signaling to members how powerful and widespread they are -- both as encouragement and intimidation.</p>
<p>Why would they want there occult or secret society to be able to be recognized?</p>
<p>In both cases, they\'re hoping for internal recognition. It\'s supposed to pass over your head as an uninteresting pattern. One sad aspect of this is that schizophrenics have a real knack for finding patterns in unrelated events. That makes people who have picked up on their &quot;tagging&quot; look unreliable, which extends some protection.&quot;*</p>
<p>Still about the same info as before, but it did bring me some new and fresh questions to the table for me to go over. Just wanted to let some people know that I am trying my best to keep looking into this occult side of things on pizzagate.</p>

            A. It's their praise to Lucifer. (Double bonus if they put it in your face and you don't notice. They're rewarded for trickery and magic) B. It's their tribal flag and a bond with eachother. C. It's a way to communicate with eachother. D. The average person doesn't notice it. E. If they do notice, in this day and age they don't realize how widespread and horrific the practices are. F. The occultists know there is nothing anyone can do about it if they do find out. G. They know you'll be deemed crazy if you point it out. And it's true.

            I think this is interesting because psychiatric diagnoses such as schizophrenia are placed on truth tellers who are then medicated to keep them quiet.

             Robin was throwing up the symbols too, he was part of the club. Celebs are killed for shits and giggles or sacrifices. Just because they killed him doesn't mean he wasn't enjoying his piece of the pizza.
