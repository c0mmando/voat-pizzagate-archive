            If I correctly understood Google's translations of some of the Norwegian articles, it sounds like Norwegian press rules don't allow direct identification of the suspects. But there are some clues given about the suspects' ages, occupations, party affiliations, and city of residence, so maybe those details can help narrow it down, at least as far as the two politicians are concerned.

            A Labor politician who served in a municipal council in Oslo was arrested on Wednesday, Oct. 12, and detained in the district court the next day. The police wouldn't say what the charges against him were, but reporters looked at the court's schedule and saw that the charges related to pornography. According to a Nov. 20 NRK article, the man said he would resign at the next council meeting.

            If "municipal council in Oslo" refers to the City Council of Oslo, then there are apparently 20 members of the Labor Party, but this site doesn't list names:

            The suspect was remanded because the police were afraid he would destroy evidence. He appealed the decision to the Gulating Court of Appeal, but the court rejected his appeal on Oct. 18.

            A member of the conservative Progress Party (FrP), a man in his 40s from eastern Norway, who was a member of a local city council, and who had previously held national political posts, was arrested on May 9 for child pornography and drug charges. He resigned by May 25.

            I also saw an article about a Democratic (KrF) politician being arrested, but apparently, I didn't save the link, and now I can't remember which links I followed to find it.

            There are several articles about a 66-year-old man from Bergen who was sentenced to eight years in prison for abusing 62 children, 42 in Norway and 20 in the Philippines.

            He was first arrested in the summer of 2010 for having almost 100,000 CP pictures and 700 movies on his computer. The police spent two years investigating him, citing a lack of funds for the reason the investigation took so long. In Jan. 2013, he was sentenced to ten months in prison, but because of the length of the investigation, he served only five months in prison.He started sending large sums of money to the Philippines, where at least one family livestreamed abuse of children. Deputy Chief of the Western Police District, Gunnar Fl√∏ystad, said it was "improper" to compare the two cases, and that readers should keep in mind that the man was convicted.

            A police officer (and his son) in the Western Police District were also identified as having been involved in the Operation Darkroom bust, but a Nov. 19 VG article said the officer was "suspected of limited dealings with abuse material," and that "he should not be suspected of having a central role in the case."

            NRK reported that the investigation was being handled by the South West Police due to conflicts of interest. The attorney Erik Johan Mjelle said he received a call from the police union to assist the suspect. All police sources declined to comment.

            The police officer's name came up in relation to some other case. His house was raided on Nov. 18, and his son was arrested there. Bergens Tilden reported that the son is believed to be central to the pornography ring. Gunnar Fl√∏ystad said at a press conference on Nov. 20 that the police officer himself is "not suspected of having had any role" in Operation Darkroom, and that "his association with this network has been extremely limited." The officer was released after being questioned. His son was remanded on Nov. 21.
