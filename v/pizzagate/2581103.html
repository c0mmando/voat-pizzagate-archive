<p>Now that more facts have come out, let\'s take a look at what we know.</p>
<p>Dwight Lamon Jones met his wife when she was med student.  When she became a doctor and the primary breadwinner, he stayed home with their son.</p>
<p>His wife filed for divorce in 2009 after 21 years of marriage.  
</p>
<p>One source of tension in the marriage was that when the child was older, she wanted him to go work. He refused.</p>
<p>She also claimed she abused her and belittled their son.  
</p>
<p>She said he once fractured her sternum.  Another time he attacked her in front of her son and after this threatened she would found at the bottom of their pool.</p>
<p>He assaulted members of his son\'s school, and they took out orders of protection on him.</p>
<p>The wife soon placed tape recorders around the house and she recorded an incident where he was verbally abusing his son and the boy had an asthma attack.  She stepped and he attacked her and threatened to kill her again.</p>
<p>She called 911 during this incident and the cops came.  There was a standoff with the cops with him inside still with his son.  After an hour he finally surrendered.</p>
<p>This is when she filed for divorce and got an order protection from him.</p>
<p>He was then arrested for disorderly conduct and had to undergo a psychiatric evaluation.</p>
<p>&quot;In November 2010, Maricopa County Superior Court Judge Pamela Gates granted the divorce, and awarded full custody to the mother, citing the father’s violent and abusive behavior and his untreated mental illness.&quot;</p>
<p>So this guy is a total piece of work with a documented history behind him.  This is not just he said/she said.   There\'s independent evidence of the above.</p>
<p>So jump to this year.   Cops have connected him and they say there\'s DNA evidence from the bullet casings to six different murders over several.   4 of those murders are connected to the divorce in one way or another.</p>
<p>The first to die was a forensic psychiatrist who testified on his wife\'s behalf </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Pitt testified in September 2010, during the couple’s divorce hearing that Jones had an anxiety disorder, mood disorder and features of antisocial, narcissistic and paranoid personality.</p>
<p>“Dr. Pitt also testified that Father poses a high risk to perpetuate violence toward mother and child and/ or himself’,” Gates wrote.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Another doctor agreed.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Dr. Paulette Selmi, meanwhile, wrote that Jones was in need of psychiatric help and “is going to continue to unravel … he will become increasingly paranoid, likely psychotic and pose an even greater threat.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Judge &quot;ordered Jones to undergo a psychiatric evaluation in 2010 but four years later, he still hadn’t done so.&quot;</p>
<p>So 8 years after two doctors says he was seriously ill and would unravel, it seems like he did unravel.  Law enforcement calls killers like these grudge collectors.  This guy seems like a classic case of it.  Remember that ex-LA cop who killed cops and their family members not long ago?  This guy seems just like him.  None of this was his fault.</p>
<p>He posted some youtube videos right before the killings where he named his victims and laid out his grudge.  He said the judge was paid off, his wife was the one abusing his son, etc. etc. etc.</p>
<p>So either we have a righteous guy who just had plan and kill six people in cold blood because of they were all working against him </p>
<p>or</p>
<p>We have a POS husband and father with a documented history of violence, who abused his family, was mentally ill and untreated, harboring grudges and planning revenge.   
</p>
<p>I beg you to look at this logically.   What\'s more likely one violent and mentally ill man did this?   Or a chunk of the legal/psychiatric community decided to go after one guy and that one guy was justified in the murder of 6 people.</p>
<p>Tell me, we haven\'t reached the point of serial killers being given the not just the benefit of the doubt, an empathetic hearing as they lay out the reasons, their victims had to die.  Tell me somebody ranting on youtube doesn\'t cause you to damn his victims and take his side.</p>
<p>Let\'s rethink this one.</p>',

            , I hear what you're saying and appreciate you focusing on the other side of the story, but please repost this in a manner that adheres to the submission rules of
            <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/v/pizzagate">
             v/pizzagate
            </a>
            . You need an accurate title (Rule 3) and you need linked sources for all major claims (Rule 2) such the assaults of the wife and people at his son's school.
           </p>
           <p>
            Because titles cannot be edited, and this one is blatantly inaccurate (the guy is innocent until proven guilty), I can't give you the edit flair for this. I have DMed you the "source" text though so you don't lose your formatting. Thanks.
