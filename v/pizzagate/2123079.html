            Here's a ROJ INITIATION RITUAL in the form of a play from 1928
            <a href="http://www.stichtingargus.nl/vrijmetselarij/roj_r.html">

            The Fool’s Prayer
The Royal feast was done; the King
Sought some new sport to banish care,
And to his jester cried, "Sir Fool,
Kneel now, and make for us a prayer."
The Jester doffed his cap and bells,
And stood the mocking court before;
They could not see the bitter smile
Behind the painted grin he wore.
He bowed his head, and bent his knee
Upon the monarch’s silken stool;
His pleading voice arose, "O Lord,
Be merciful to me, a fool.
"No pity, Lord, could change the heart
From red with wrong to white as wool;
The rod must heal the sin; but Lord,
Be merciful to me, a fool!
"Tis not by guilt the onward sweep
Of truth and right, O Lord, we stay;
‘Tis by follies that so long
We hold the earth from heaven away.
"These clumsy feet, still in the mire,
Go crushing blossoms without end;
These hard, well-meaning hands we thrust
Among the heart strings of a friend.
"The ill-timed truth we might have kept—
Who knows how sharp it pierced and stung?
The word we had not sense to say—
Who knows how grandly it had rung?
"Our faults no tenderness should ask,
The chastening stripes must cleanse them all:
But for our blunders—Oh, in shame
Before the eyes of heaven we fall.
"Earth bears no balsam for mistakes;
Men crown the knave, and scourge the fool
That did his will; but Thou, O Lord,
Be merciful to me, a fool!"
The room was hushed; in silence rose
The King, and sought his gardens cool,
And walked apart, and murmured low,
"Be merciful to me, a fool!’

             Rotary's founder, Paul P. Harris was born in Racine, Wisconsin. Rotary is very important in Racine and Wisconsin, and these groups play an important role in the layers of international corruption and control in association with global education, health, viruses, and vaccines.
            </p>
            <p>
             Racine is a central hub for regional, national and global Rotary operations. Many involved are part of a network involved in racketeering, bribery, extortion, fraud, embezzlement, rigged development deals, rigged elections, rigged votes, blackmail, retaliation, surveillance, collusion, conspiracy, murder and other crimes.
            </p>
            <p>
             Paul Ryan is the Boy Scout front man hiding the real Evil and Truth in his district - Racine, Wisconsin. Rotary and Boy Scouts are not what they appear to be. Neither is Sustainability (Satan's Ability).
            </p>
            <p>
             We know the real Truth about Paul Ryan and Racine, Wisconsin, and the world needs to know before it is too late. There is much more to his VP partnership with Mitt Romney, his relationship with Hastert and other pedos, and his involvement in the Amazon and Foxconn deals in Racine County.
            </p>
            <p>
             Does the world want to be Saved or Enslaved?

            The Shriners have a children's hospital. I remember seeing their fucking commercials all the time on fox news. They aired the most often during Bill O'Reilly's segment.

              This is part of a much bigger pay to play racketeering, trafficking, harvesting, abuse and corruption network. Another major donor to the Mayo Clinic tied to Clinton Foundation, Clinton Health Access Initiative. and Clinton Global Initiative and many of the international hubs involved are the Johnsons of Racine, Wisconsin who are covered by Paul Ryan and others in the network. Wisconsin wields unusual power in national and global politics, art, education, religion and industry. We know why.

             <p>
              Everyone needs to know the real Truth about who is controlling all aspects of our lives including healthcare, drugs, and what we are consuming. It is a global coalition of public, private and secret groups across industries, governments, and religions. The modern-day structure, new world order, and real model and Agenda was created in Racine, Wisconsin.
             </p>
             <p>
              Sustainability is a major part of this network, and is the ultimate deception (Satan's Ability) that leads to Global Enslavement. They are also using Sanctuary Cities to reform identification and education, and the next step to Global Enslavement is the Mark of the Beast enforced through AI and Community Policing where Racine is the model.
             </p>
             <p>
              The direct chain of command is Rothschilds &gt; Rockefellers &gt; Johnsons (Racine, WI). There are many levels of interconnected groups, foundations, corporations, churches, clubs, secret societies involved. Racine is the "Root" and model for the new Global Agenda.
