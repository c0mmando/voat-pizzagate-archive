<p>Hello, v/pizzagate. Love what you guys are doing here, ashamed I don\'t have the time to put in real work like you guys do.

<p>With yesterday\'s radio interview, it is likely Julian Assange is still alive, unless they have technology to do such an extremely convincing fake. I have heard information about a killswitch he may have had, in case he died. Was this supposed to release information in the event of his death, that would be potentially so damaging it guaranteed his safety as nobody would want to kill him, and therefore have his killswitch go off, and release information possibly along the lines of FBIanon\'s comments that would potentially destabilize governments. Or am I way off base in what the killswitch actually means?</p>
<p> Assange, via leaking Podesta\'s emails, got spirit cooking out to the public, then some people started realizing the bizarre code words he was talking in and it led to the beginnings of Pizzagate\'s information. Could this be the actual information he had in his killswitch and instead of holding it as his insurance token, it started to get out? I could also assume he could just have concrete proof of people involved. Or is it possible that he actually has something even worse stored up as an incentive not to kill him. If I had to make a guess, it would be something so sinister and horrifying that he probably doesn\'t even want to release the information because it really could cause governments to be overthrown and civil war in various countries across the world definitely including the USA. Anyone have any guesses to what that information could be? Also, please let me know if I am totally off target, I haven\'t been keeping up as well as I could have. If so, please tell me how much of an idiot I am, I know I deserve it.</p>',

            I am convinced that the info he has are the emails on Weiner's lap top.  I believe someone hacked it and gave it to Wikileaks.  Just recently Craig Murray a former UK ambassador and close to Assange divulged that he met with someone in a park in DC that gave him the info.  I have also read that what is on that laptop is so vile and disgusting such as sex tapes of Hillary etc, and others that it would reek havoc.  It scares the hell out of me to imagine what would happen upon release, but I have always believed that it is better to air your dirty linen to air out your unmentionables. The FBI should release them, but are probably afraid of the blame they will suffer when the Sh** Hits The Fan.

             That is a good answer, but doesn't the NYPD also have that info and are threatening to go public with it? I really wish they'd hurry up and do so. I wonder how many civilian investigators here have tried contacting NYD members who might be willing to leak some info.

            I think you mean his Dead Man's Switch. It's his insurance against getting killed....
           </p>
           <p>
            oh,, and the stuff that came out in the podesta emails was NOT his insurance,,, but you can be pretty fkin sure that there's plenty on the elite pedo's in the insurance files [which are an 88gb file that you can download... oh but don't download the file that's up there now as it has been altered since Wikileaks was believed to be compromised. You need to find a copy that was posted pre october this year. The DMS would be a release of the key's to this file].
           </p>
           <p>
            have a read of this [apologies i'm gonna have to break the link cuz my internet get's killed everytime I post this]

              Tread carefully friend,,, all the pizza talk is something they are confident they can brush away as 'conspiracy theory' and hence they'll let us chatter away. But talk too much about trying to find the insurance key's and you'll find it's a different story...
