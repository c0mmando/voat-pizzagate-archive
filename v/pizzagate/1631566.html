            As a mod, I try to always keep in mind that many folks in this subverse have a personal stake in this investigation, either because they were abused, or someone they love was. I also think there is a high percentage of
            <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/v/pizzagate">
             v/pizzagate
            </a>
            users who are from elsewhere and are not Voaters in the cultural sense that
            <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/user/Crensch">
             @Crensch
            </a>
            typifies (i.e. belligerantly freespeech and adamantly anti-safespace). It's a recipe for a huge culture clash.
           </p>
           <p>
            One thing I would say is that everyone can benefit from assimilating a bit of that culture -- from embracing the fact that God put a middle finger on both of our hands and we shouldn't be afraid to use them. Someone who has been subject to abuse ESPECIALLY needs to. Crensch has a lot to teach in that department.
           </p>
           <p>
            I also never assume just because someone is rude, insensitive, abrasive, or acts like an asshole that they are evil or an enemy. I have yet to meet someone who has been a true protector or defender of my health, safety, or liberty -- be they a soldier, an attorney, or a surgeon -- who wasn't an "asshole" willing to inflict pain and disregard feelings. It's the assholes who don't give a fuck about feelings that will be the ones with the fortitude, focus and stamina to pursue and prosecute the child trafficking globalists. We need as many of them as we can get.

            Wow I'm sorry you were subjected to that, it's completely unnecessary to be that much of a dick to
            <em>
             anyone
            </em>
            . I was hoping we'd all realised that being a spiteful bastard is how
            <em>
             they
            </em>
            operate, and how they want us to operate so that we're all alienating ourselves from one another and too busy fighting amongst ourselves to pay attention to their heinous crimes.
           </p>
           <p>
            People who go online and get off on letting loose by being horrible to others in a way they never would dream of doing in meatspace, in my opinion have no place in the future world that's rid itself of the elite monster pedo rings - that kind of attitude is the kind those sick perverted creatures love, it's what they want, and it plays right into their hands to act that way. They don't expect us to all be kind and decent to one another because we've been brainwashed out of empathy to a large extent - literally it seems that this guy considers it unfashionable to be friendly or care about the wellbeing of strangers, and I've noticed that happening more and more, and it couldn't be more what the assholes on high want.
           </p>
           <p>
            So in sum, I agree with you, fighting back is more than just investigating and demanding justice, it's also about saying no to dickishness and to reject assholery in all its forms. I am only a new little mod though so I'm not sure what I can do to help other than try to convince him that he's being an unwitting tool of The Pedos That Be, or perhaps he is a witting tool, I guess if he keeps up with that kind of thing it'll become obvious? It seems he has done a lot for the sub from reading over things, so maybe he has a squidgy heart in there somewhere?

             Also, OP is nothing but a shitstirring troll, and you taking his side is extremely suspect.

            stops being a fucking dick in his responses - I feel someone who "doesn't care" is a good person to have in "charge". Someone who doesn't feel one way or the other who can be objective.

             Thanks for the ping.  Foxxy is a cowardly liar and dishonest arguer.

             This is Voat, where I don't have to have a reason to be nasty to someone, but I had a very good reason to be nasty to OP.
            </p>
            <p>
             OP accused me of not caring about victims of child-rape when I very specifically said that I do not care about their feelings.  OP also pushes for allowing just any shit-tier content to be left alone here, which as we all know, would cause this place to become unusable.
            </p>
            <p>
             OP is either a D&amp;C shill, troll, or one of the most useful idiots for the child-fuckers on the internet, and I find all three to be extremely detestable.

                That's fine. I'm just worried about the quality of posts and the general outlook on this subverse - there's a lot of shillin' and a lot of misinformation floating around.
               </p>
               <p>
                Thanks for the welcome and thanks for the help getting Voat off the ground.

                This subverse isn't about making friends, granted. But politeness doesn't cost anything.. That's kind of all I'm saying, respect other peoples problems whether you agree, disagree or couldn't give a shit.

                 All that matters is that a narrative isn't being pushed - and no narrative is being pushed here beyond "follow the rules".  Peoples' perception of the place will most likely be from the front page, not from /new.
                </p>
                <p>
                 Also, this is Voat.  Moderators' opinions mean fuck-all here because they're just janitors, not gods like the other place.

                 Voat was fine, PG on Voat was close to getting brigaded by the users into nothingness because the mods here didn't know what, or how, to manage the utter onslaught of shitposts.

                  This subverse isn't about making friends, granted. But politeness doesn't cost anything.. That's kind of all I'm saying, respect other peoples problems whether you agree, disagree or couldn't give a shit.

                 OP got respect until it began lying about me and my position.  I was

                  extremely nice
                 </em>
                 and helpful with showing OP how to ping, and explaining the rules - to which OP responded saying I was unhelpful and left some question of OP's unanswered, which I clearly did not.
