                 his 'broken clock' was just synchronised with Barr, Horowitz and Durham's clocks

                <p>
                 now, you can think what you like about whether the DoJ is corrupt or not, but there's no more question that Q is working directly with them

                  Great. That means Q is a criminal like Barr. Barr was the lead man in the Iran Contra dug and gun running scheme. He was the point man for Bush Sr. and Bill Clinton. You know back when they slit the throats of those innocent boys and put them on the train tracks for a train to run over. Barr was the guy that watched the money. Barr discovered that some of their criminal associates had skimmed 100 million dollars from the take and told them basically "whoever is stealing our money better stop before you get yourself killed."
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  It never ceases to amaze me that NONE of you Qberts bother to look into the past behavior of Trump's swamp creatures. Oh, and Barr also let Epstein skate. And there is much more.

                   Right
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   so we have 3 scenarios:
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   1) Q / team Barr / Trump are, despite the sins of their past, now reformers who will significantly damage the global pedomafia
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   2) Q / team Barr / Trump are bluffing and will just chop off a tentacle or two of the pedomafia to fool the public that they are 'the good guys'
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   3) Q / team Barr / Trump are totally bluffing and will do fuck all while increasing public awareness of the pedomafia and the nature of corruption
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   even scenario 3) is a gain in public awareness
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   I mean - in Q's absence, what 'clean up' job would WE be doing otherwise? NONE. NOTHING. We dont have the numbers, we dont have the authority. We'd just be skulking around voat with shit on our liver every day like you, ES
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   so even if Q ends u disappointing tens of millions, thats tens of millions more that now know something needs to be done

                    I have a 4th scenario. Q is the t shirt selling grifter Coleman Rogers from Patriot Soapbox that got using the Q trip code twice. And this grifter serves nothing more than covering Trump's ass while Trump fills his cabinet with criminals like Barr and Goldman Sachs bankers. That fact that yall have not been able to see the evolution of "qanon" over the last couple of years and realize that this newest grifter is about Qanon number is pretty sad.

                    <p>
                     is that Coleman Rogers repeatedly redicts 1:29 9 December as a date of significance for the Department of Justice
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     and in fulfullment of his prediction, Barr Horowitz and Durham all synchronise their public statements at 1:29
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     So, what? Its your contention that Barr Durham and Horowitz are doing it for a cut of the t shirt  profits? Yea. I'm sure that explains their motivation 🙄

                        Not only because, regardless of my own position and ES's dodging, you succinctly pointed out the need to factor the 1:29 anomaly into claims such as "Q is not connected to officials in/with access to the Trump admin", seeing as how it shits on them – but also because it'll be an interesting experiment to see how quickly I get downvoted in such an old, nested and peripheral to a suspected stalker comment...

            I don't see how this is pizzagate related. There's no direct link to elite pedophilia, only indirect through Q. If this is enough of a connection, why can't we post any old news article about the Clintons or Podestas here?

              So another indirect connection. Because those people are being implicated by Q, that makes this post pizzagate related?

            Nothing surprises me and if only we could see how really convoluted the world is, we would die of heart attacks. Behind the scenes none of us would believe what is going on. It is a nightmare and most have no idea. By the way, am convinced after today, that Brad Pitt is the father of my daughter. I know, most will find this funny or silly but I mean it. Believe the information because I often don't want to read the road signs, too gruesome. P.S. took down my post on Paul Newman because we already have enough problems and it is true, never saw him in the act but had enough people telling me the same stories.

              I deserved every one of your downvotes, you caught me pointing out how just freaking hawkish this sub is. I guess not one of you compiled anything on paper or video and sent your findings to someone who could present it to the public all nice and neat. Facts. So your research, deleting comments or posts because of rules, calling people names and infighting, is for nothing? Just power? Pat yourself on the back, let's get this party started.

             If it is contended that Q anon is an undisputed part of the Trump administration, then it stands to reason that as an unofficial policy, nodded and winked to supporters of the Trump administration via Q, that Trump A) admits pizzagate is real, and B) has an ethical responsibility to bring justice to the perpetrators
            </p>
            <p>
             It doesnt matter whether or not it is an openly articulated 'Campaign Promise' of Trump - Trump knows that his supporters (those who follow Q at least) regard it as his acknowledged responsibility to do something about the pizzagate networks

               Let's posit that you are correct and Donald Trump has created the citizen-fueled corruption research and networking movement known as QAnon as part of his "Drain the Swamp" platform to increase his popularity and win re-election. Why is that bad?
              </p>
              <p>
               Why do you think involving Joe Citizen in researching and exposing globalist corruption -- including their abuse of kids -- is not related to pizzagate?
              </p>
              <blockquote>

              <p>
               Let me quote from our Definition of Pizzagate, which reads "Relevant submissions would be any content that can be linked (by the OP in a sourced explanation) to organized human trafficking of children, the sexual/physical abuse and/or murder of those children, and/or the systematic cover up of these activities and/or the protection/assistance provided to the people who engage in said activities."
              </p>
              <p>
               Using illegally obtained FISA warrants to wiretap the candidate (Donald Trump) who ran on the promise to Drain the Swamp, Build the Wall, and stop child trafficking falls squarely under "systemic cover up" and "protection provided to the people who engage in" pizzagate.
              </p>
              <p>
               Furthermore, using information obtained from that illegal surveillance to attempt to destroy Trump supporters who spoke up about pizzagate such as
               <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/v/pizzagate/1470601">
                General Mike Flynn and Roger Stone
               </a>
               is also clearly directly related.

                Why are you asking such a stupid question? I see posting Q as redundant, most all of Q PG stuff came from here in order to hook researchers away from digging deeper, I think it makes people go backwards in truth, not forward. Qtards are incapable of redpilling pizzagaters, since they still think government is gonna fix PG. The people who knew about this before 1990, have experienced the Governments help before, they know different.

                When did DJT promise to end child trafficking? I missed it. You do know that walls are made to keep people in, too. I would rather 'gut shoot 'em at the border' than waste money on wall.

                    Seriously?!? Cuz if I thought you really meant that, I would take the time to go back through all of the literally hundreds of unanswered questions I've asked Qturds in the past. and post some to be answered. I know i erased many in my DMs, but there are probably still some in my comments.

               this proves that Q is legit

              <p>
               just because they havent reached some arbitrary step in the process of justice that you decide, doesnt mean you get to decide on behalf of the pizzagate community not to legitimise Q posts

               1) i dont have to prove youre wrong bc both propositions can be simultaneously true. they arent mutually exclusive

              <p>
               2) the fISA review is peripheral to elite pedophilia. But THROUGH it, we have established incontrovertible co-ordination between the DoJ and the world most widely recognised anti pizzagate/pedogate advocate known as Q anon.

                1} You're right, both of us can be correct. I still don't see the connection to PG. Show me clear links, please.

                2) Your submission implies that the FISA Review reveals something we need to know about in PG.

               <p>
                I'm curious why you want me to believe you, when you clearly have no proof. HOW IS THIS CONNECTED TO ELITE PEDOPHILIA? There are many PG sub members who do not follow Q.

                It's YOUR responsibility to tell ME how your post is relevant to PG. Aren't you a mod on GA? You should have a ton of clearly written evidence at your finger tips.

                 arguing that you cant post anything whatsoever about Q - the worlds most recognised anti pedogate proponent - unless the specific development it is 100% about elite pedophilia is like saying we arent allowed to post about the alleged assassination of Jenny Moore

                      While you may think I'm frustrated, that would be a lie. I am capable of answering every question as to why I don't trust DJT, Q, DOJ, Jews, RCC, LDS, FBI, CIA, NSA, REP, DEM, FEMA and even OSHA. You have yet to explain to anyone who doesn't follow Q, why it should be believed.

                        Naw, I just think it's funny you won't give an honest answer to honest questions. I never denied not trusting Q. But I don't need to trust Q or you. If Q is all you say it is, then great, prove it. But if it is another psyop being played on everyone, then I think it belongs elsewhere, just like seth rich stuff.

                          Why do you keep saying that my distrust of some lying anon, on another website equals "dark intentions". Or are you saying that Q doesn't lie? Cuz I know that all them Qtards run around squealing that "disinfo is necessary". it isn't needed in PG sub. We need truth.

                         <p>
                          When Q stops lying, I'll start listening. Not before.

                              Separating Q into it's own sub has not "shut down all major lines of inquiry on PG", but you say that my and others wanting to keep an admitted source of disinformation out of PG, unless independently verified means we have "dark intentions".

                               I've never accused you of anything untrue. It's you who makes unsourced claims, not me. You are not arguing from a place of honesty and good will. Anyone reading this thread can see you dodging, weaving and deflecting. Just because you pretend you are not doing it doesn't make people blind. But let me spell it out for you:
                              </p>
                              <p>
                               Enty is an admitted source of disinfo. FBIAnon is an admitted source of disinfo. Wikileaks is widely believed by many goats to be a source of disinfo. Remember the much vaunted "Phase III" of Podesta emails that Assange never dropped? The cryptic chess board tweet? All major MSM cited in research here are sources of disinfo. A large portion of the work of this board is to analyze disinfo and document it. Why only whine about QAnon? A fair application of the dictatorial content curation you are pushing for would require removing ALL of these.
                              </p>
                              <p>
                               And that doesn't even take into consideration the fact that Q has been proven true dozens of times, despite your constant chanting otherwise.
                              </p>
                              <p>
                               Your continued desire to censor discussion of it from this board -- a board that was very likely created directly because of what later became known as QAnon -- is going to get you exactly nowhere with me. Not from you. Not from ES. Not from those he recruited during his consensus cracking operation. Not from that doxing piece of shit Slime. Not today. Not tomorrow. Not ever. And guess what? I don't fuck around playing games here. I've left you thugs, malcontents and manipulators no leverage points to use against me. You are stuck.
                              </p>
                              <p>
                               If you don't like that, I recommend you leave. You are wasting your time.
                              </p>
                              <p>
                               And lest you think that you will wear me down by wasting mine, you should know that every time I see another one of these QAnon attack threads it has

                                exactly the opposite effect

                                 I think there's a good chance it will be Obama, for signing off on Page and Strok's illegal surveillance. There's proof he was being kept in the loop on the whole wicked scheme.

                                 I also know that Trump doesn't give away his moves in advance, so this could be a bait and switch designed to make them waste even more ammo. We might get an RBG state funeral out of that one.

                                 Another possibility could be high ranking individuals in the Catholic Church. That would cause a "mass pop awakening".

                                 There absolutely is evidence DJT, Q and Assange work together. If you bothered to "follow politics" you wouldn't make such an ignorant claim. ProTip: If you don't want to look like a shill, don't pontificate about things you admit you know nothing about.

                                 If Rich was the source of the DNC emails, that would make him a participant as well. I tend to think that Rich gave Craig Murray the DNC emails for his own reasons, though, not because he had any knowledge of a whitehat counter-coup.

                                 was the first Q sub on Voat, with lively collaborative research and discussion for months. The most influential voices -- at least a dozen -- were targeted and attacked by proven shills, just as you have been attacking MH for bringing up the subject, so as to split and divide the community and pit people against each other. And guess what? They failed.

The questions keep piling up to the point i forget the subject. All my own failings, i admit. Still doesn't mean I didn't try.

                                   You have to be kidding. MSM won't touch Q with a 1000 yard pole. Just like they wouldn't address a single one of the real questions collectively known as "pizzagate". They push a set of canned talking points, none of which accurately reflect the truth.

                                   was the first Q sub on Voat. Literally. The first subverse to discuss Q posts was

                                   . The OP who made those first posts DMed me a week ahead of time to find out how to talk about it without getting sideways with Falcon and the ruleset. The discussion was virtually shill free for a few weeks and no one had a problem with it. Then BOOM! Suddenly all the submissions on the topic were filled with trolls. I didn't take it very seriously until I saw that happen. Then I started to pay very close attention.
                                  </p>

                                   Why are you asking about the creator of PG? He abandoned the sub within months of pizzagate breaking, over a year before Q began leaking. Are you just throwing shit at the wall to see what sticks?

                                   That is essentially what they did do by timing their various actions to occur
                                   <em>
                                    at the same time

                                   . You do understand what a backchannel is, right?  Trump and his team can't just come out and say "Yep. That was me posting hints about classified information on 8chan." They'd actually have a reason to impeach him, then. Why would you want someone that ham fisted in charge of the nuclear codes?

                                  <p>
                                   It's like you don't want there to be a way for Trump to communicate with his base that the MSM can't control.

                                   I recommend if you want to get questions answered, you ask them in good faith and stop acting like a troll all the time. No one takes you seriously anymore. Why would they waste time explaining stuff to you that if you cared you could find out for yourself?

                                     Why are you asking about the creator of PG? He abandoned the sub within months of pizzagate breaking, over a year before Q began leaking. Are you just throwing shit at the wall to see what sticks?

                                    Why can't I ask about the creator of PG? I am curious, maybe others are too. Thank you for at least admitting that Q was not involved in KKWW starting PG.

                                     That is essentially what they did do by timing their various actions to occur at the same time. You do understand what a backchannel is, right?

                                    This is where i get lost. Didn't it come out that most of these people don't run their Twit Accts by themselves? That assistants and other office personnel use their accts too? I know I read that somewhere, very early in my exploring the web. It surprised me cuz I would never let a secretary have access to something like twit or FB, with my name on it. My point is that i  don't know if those people made those tweets, or some other people did. No way to tell.

                                     Trump and his team can't just come out and say "Yep. That was me posting hints about classified information on 8chan." They'd actually have a reason to impeach him, then.

                                    So your position is that DJT is a criminal, and deserves to be impeached for leaking classified intel?

                                    My position is that Q is brainchild of reelection campaign, and doesn't have access to classified material. Therefore, DJT is not breaking law by letting Q larp.

                                    Or maybe make a submission to PGmods and make your complaints about a former PG sub member who you are sure is out to destroy all your fine work. After all, isn't that what you want everyone else to do with their complaints against others? If you really consider me to be such a subversive, then you owe it to the other PGers to make sure they know not to talk to, or listen to me. It would also be nice if you could let them know the list of people who if they fraternize with, could get them on your shit list. New people must be warned, help to keep them from wrongthink.

                                    <p>
                                     If a follow-up/second reply isn't posted by me within, say, 20 mins of this one, I probably had to crash. In which case, I'll come back to it.
                                    </p>

                         Just my two cents... All things considered, Pizzagate doesn't exist as the spot to prove or disprove Q to be what he/they claim.  So Q proofs are better posted and discussed on PGW, due to it being generally off topic.  But Q related research does cover ground in PG and beyond (delving into politics and powerful people is relevant to international child trafficking topics), and some things should be freely posted here regardless of how one views that specific info (pov of being pro or anti Trump). Example:

                         So if someone connects Ukraine and CF in relation to kids being exploited I see no reason why the link to that particular Q drop shouldn't be allowed to be mentioned solely because it's considered "Q" related.

                        <p>
                         Or posts relating to Adam Schiff and Standard Hotel, why shouldn't someone be allowed to mention the Q posts about those within the context of the topic, (not in an attempt to prove or disprove Q as the reason for posting).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                         PG contributors should be able to get along on common topics, whether the pro Trump user mentions that Q posted something relevant to a topic that is PG related or whether an anti Trump user points out why they think Trump is really not what Q claims.  But the overriding goal should always be to stay on topic, respect the rules and further the body of research.

                           But Q related research does cover ground in PG and beyond (delving into politics and powerful people is relevant to international child trafficking topics),

                          Never said that some Q post don't belong here. The problem is that Q doesn't post anything that we don't already have.

                          Thank you. It may surprise you to know, I'm not anti-DJT. I hold all elected officials to the same high standards. All of them fail, miserably.

                          I don't care where PG submitters get their info, as long as they can back up what they claim with clear, linear evidence, it's good to have differing sources.
