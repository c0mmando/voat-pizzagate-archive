<p>Gulf Cartel Attacks Mexican Farming Family near Border – Mostly Children Shot</p>
<p>Tamaulipas – Gulf Cartel gunmen attacked a local farming family, killing one child and adults. Three teen girls and a 73-year-old man were injured.</p>
<p>The attack took place on Saturday night south of Reynosa, near the Libramiento Sur 2 highway in the rural community of Congregacion Garza, law enforcement sources revealed to Breitbart Texas. Various members of a family named Olivares were traveling in two vehicles as they returned from a confirmation celebration when a group of Gulf Cartel gunmen opened fire.</p>
<p>The victims called for help, setting off a massive response by Tamaulipas state law enforcement who searched for the attackers. A squad of police rushed the injured victims to a local hospital. The Gulf Cartel is terrorizing farmers in the southern part of Reynosa. As part of their recent attacks, gunmen torched homes, kidnapped ranchers, and threatened farmers to leave their homes. The dirt roads commonly used by farmers are now main routes used by Gulf Cartel to avoid law enforcement.  No safety</p>
<p>The attack against the Olivarez family comes three weeks after cartel gunmen in the border state of Sonora killed nine victims and injured several others in an apparent case of mistaken identity. The victims were all Mormons with dual U.S./Mexican citizenship living on a family settlement. </p>
<p>Editor’s Note: Breitbart Texas traveled to the Mexican States of Tamaulipas, Coahuila, and Nuevo León to recruit citizen journalists willing to risk their lives and expose the cartels silencing their communities.  The writers would face certain death at the hands of the various cartels that operate in those areas including the Gulf Cartel and Los Zetas if a pseudonym were not used. </p>
<p>It is time for the Mexican Government to end this, but they will not, since they are paid by the cartels to look the other way</p>
<p>this cartel might be Nancy\'s friends. Not sure which one she met with while in Mexico. . Beto was with her since he speaks spanish.</p>
<p>In May of 2016, US Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi visited the President of Mexico along with other Congressmen, including little known Texas Congressman Beto O’Rourke.</p>
<p>The Gulf Cartel has been terrorizing residents in the area, with brutal attacks ranging from burning buildings to kidnapping people. The Gilf Cartel is using the dirt roads frequented by farmers as a means to avoid law enforcement.</p>

            did you guys notice that this has fuck-all to do with elite pedophilia, and everything to do with a bunch of taco niggers?  Wonder why this got 12 upvotes?  Where are you all when the shill, fagdryer, posts irrelevant garbage here?  Aren't you concerned with the integrity of this board?

                Oh, it probably has something to do with your pattern of behaviour up through now, and your absolute lie 6.1 hours ago that YOU took it down.

                You're a liar.  I don't work with liars, and I don't work with those that support people like ESOTERICshade and other shills.  Turns out, not everyone on here has the same goals.  Mine is to bust pedos, yours seems to be sliding the forum to prevent that.

                  Let's get something straight, here, ES. The reason
                  <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/u/Crensch">
                   @Crensch
                  </a>
                  thinks
                  <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/u/fogdryer">

                  </a>
                  is a shill, is because you ran a massive psyop here in which you used multiple sock puppet accounts to attack pg contributors so you could use your main account to defend them and be the hero. You gathered a following and then used it to vote brigade people you wanted to silence. Fogdryer was one of those you duped into your little consensus cracking posse.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  Crensch doesn't think fogdryer was duped. He thinks fogdryer is working with you, deliberately making rule breaking posts so you can play your "defend the persecuted submitters from the bully mods" routine.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  Fogdryer has a history of not meeting submission requirements, and several people besides Crensch have pointed this out and asked if I would ban. I have not yet done so, because I have not seen a pattern of trying to derail our investigation. I've seen a pattern of trying to improve submissions and stay within the bounds of the ruleset. I've tried to operate with fogdryer as if YOU had never entered the picture and soiled the reputations of multiple submitters. I've probably been too lax and I'm sure I'll get skewered at some point for being inconsistent or whatever.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  Crensch cares about this place as much as I do, and his conscience doesn't allow him to stand idly by and watch liars like you and your posse manipulate and sabotage unchecked. All he had to do to bring you guys out into the open was make a submission.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  Crensch isn't the problem here, ES. YOU are the problem. Crensch handed the reins here to me because he cares about this place. You claim to care, and have been asked to delete your account as proof of that for what you did to this board. Yet here you still are.

                   I decided to go ahead and read this. Dude, if I had done even half the shit you think I am capable of it would have taken me more time than I even have.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   I had ONE beef. ONE. That ONE beef was that I didn't wan't pizzagate and Q mixed together. I decided to try to fix that situation before it got out of control. Its over. I fixed it.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   Two years ago you were telling me "in less than two months the rothschilds, clintons, obama, soros, will be in GITMO"
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   I told you that was not realistic because I know who "Qanon" is. Everybody knows who Qanon is. The only reason they let Coleman Rogers pretend to be a mil intel asset is because he is aligned with the deep state.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   "Qanon" (coleman rogers) is in favor of attacking Iran. What the fuck dude? Why do the innocent people of Iran deserve to have their little country bombed into the stone age? Why?
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   Iran is almost the last country on earth that does not have a Rothschild Central Bank and thats why they will get bombed into the stone age. You are on the wrong side of this situation. You are a deep state cheerleader and you don't even realize it.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   You need to stop looking behind every bush and tree for me because I'm not there. I did ONE job, which was shove Q out of pizzagate. I didn't dox srayzie, although I could have. She suckered you into a White Knight role and fucked us all. That bitch is crazy. I know it for a fact. She caused you lose your integrity around here.

                   did the honorable thing when he outed her for the insane crazy bitch that she is. If you knew as much about her as I do, you would keep your distance.

                    's fuckery was obvious to me long before he betrayed srayzie's trust, just like yours was. I, however, keep my powder dry and don't share what I know until the time is right. I tried to warn srayzie not to trust Kev, just like I warned her not to trust you. It's because of
                    <em>

                    evidence that half of ProtectVoat mods quit. It's because of

                    </em>
                    evidence that the full mod teams of both PG and GA outed your nefarious activities. Srayzie was only a small part of it. Far from being the instigator you want to paint her as, srayzie tried to convince me for most of a year that you were a nice guy. And that Kev was. Both

                    was all the way back when Kev as an O unbanned hojuruku and wouldn't reban him, right after Falcon was demodded. What he did to srayzie was only the final confirmation.

                    It cracks me up that you, the scum of Voat, are trying to rehabilitate Sheriff Kev. My how his fortunes have fallen!  Thank you for letting me know. As I look back on this year's accomplishments, it's great to know I made a difference!

                     I recommend you stop spreading disinformation and bullshit with the Q movement and do something real. Something real like repeal the Patriot Act or any other of a few dozen causes that would make a difference in our daily life.

                     The Qberts are the herpes of the truth movement. There is a good reason why the old truthers that founded this movement want the Q bullshit to die. If you can't figure it out then you can't. Its cancer bro.

                   Watching you self destruct has sort of become a sidwshow for a lot of us. Blow yourself up some more. Its amusing as fuck. What happened? Did your girlfriend break up with you? You did too much meth? What the fuck is up with you these days? There was a time when I almost respected you but goddamn what happened?

                     Unfortunately he has not pulled the trigger yet. There is still hope. He gets depressed around the holidays, Christmas is coming. Maybe he will blow his brains out in a few days and give us all some relief. I hope so.

                       I just ignore him. He don't bother me. Sometimes I troll him into doing stupid shit, just like I troll you into doing stupid shit. You are my pet monkey. You will do the opposite of what I tell you to do. It amused me for a little while, but you are getting boring now. You are Voat's lol cow and you don't even realize it.

                        Let me guess, are you going to put your boots up on a table, or something like that?  What was that fremdschamen thing you used to say?  I'm not 100% on that, but it seems like you told a story about your life, kinda like SWMBO does when she's flustered and has nothing clever to say.  Somehow you think narrating some action of yours is good trolling.

                            is ten times a hundred a better mod than you ever dreamed of being. Vindicator does a damn good thankless job at what he does. I have a lot of respect for Vindicator. I would never do what he does, god bless his soul. When the Q burns out, and it will, he will still be there plugging away because he believes in what he does.

                      So it looks like I was right to think you're either a desperate, insecure beta that acts like a Jew, or an actual Jew.  Remember that story I put together of you bringing up meth heads multiple times?  I can post it again for you, if you'd like.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                      Who is it, then, since you're being so forthcoming?  Brother? Father? Son?  Cousin?  Tranny?  Was it really a sister or daughter, but you're using "he" because I did?
                     </p>
                     <p>
                      Srayzie defended you as much as she could throughout, despite what you did to her; you and kev are betrayers of the highest order.  She didn't deserve any of that.

                       I was a good friend to her. I kept all her secrets, and I still keep them. I NEVER told anybody any personal information about her. I was true to my word and I still am. I can't say the same for her. If I hated her, trust me, I could make life hell. That ain't my style. I'm not gonna do it. She sent her titties to you all, and blamed me, because Qanon is farce and a joke psyop.

             Of course they did. But fogdryer/carmencita (that one was never figured out in the end, just overlooked and deflected from) is TTT's little pet, so they all look the other way.
