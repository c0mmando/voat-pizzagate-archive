<p><a href="http://archive.is/XFqjS">Haiti Cholera: A Biological Weapon For Organ Trafficking?</a>
“Cholera is an infection of choice for those unfortunately slated for organ harvesting. Cholera doesn’t really harm the organs, but allow them to pull the plug when they claim the child is at death’s door.” — Pah abe
Haiti Occupied: The International Horrors Metered out on the Helpless The UN soldier are proxies for the US war in Haiti. Seven months after the earthquake, they imported the cholera bacteria. The US has used bioweapons and tested chemical weapons on its own people. Haiti present an even easier target for its nefarious biowafare activities. In fact, both Russian and Venezuelan officials claimed, immediately after the 2010 Haiti earthquake, that it was geoengineered by the US.  The Russian Northern Fleets in the area at the time of the Haiti earthquake, reportedly said the Haiti earthquake was caused by “a flawed US Navy ‘earthquake weapons’ test before the weapons could be utilized against Iran.”</p>
<p>The Laboratory:<br />
Haitians call the CIA, US intelligence, their Duopoly, UN/NGOs and the Deep State (BIS) banksters, the “Laboratory.”</p>
<p>Haiti has a long history of being the Guinea Pigs for US Laboratory tests. Haitians have been the victims of their organ trafficking, child sex rings, prostitution, foul vaccines, rape, forced pregnancies, free trade zone import quota frauds, deaths quads, drug smuggling, money laundering, gun trafficking, human trafficking and humanitarian frauds in Haiti. The Laboratory (Deep State) conducts false flag operations to destabilize and test the public reactions, experiment and refine their attack weapons.</p>
<p>“It’s far worse than (Èzili) depicted Sarah….the inhumane slaughtering of her people in the hands of DynCorp Organ, LTD, UN ‘Peacekeepers’, and the trained gangs that rained terror upon the populace to keep them in line.”
Are folks ready to understand this? To understand that rape is a tool of war, and the mind trauma, disfunction and sexual orientation confusion and insecurities this particular abuse brings, especially when practiced on innocent children and babies, are a US-Euro colonial tool of war, dependency, domination and mass destruction. Sexual programing is a traditionally tool used to break the strongest Blacks among us and to feed the elites’ bloodlust, literally and figuratively as agents of genocides.</p>
<p>Besides, biological toxins such as UN-imported cholera in Haiti, rape, psychological abuse and dislocation are a form of warfare that has destroyed Black families and colonized communities since the era of the TransAtlantic Trade and Arab Slave trades.</p>
<h1></h1>
<p><em>This stood out to me. We have talked here in the past and wondered why black people seem to be the biggest targets. The following makes sense...</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Melanin-rich organs are superior in value and highly valued by the vampire elites. They believe themselves superior but need Black bodies to feed their for-profit prison industrial complex and eternal wars to continue worldwide for the systemic genocide against Black and brown communities, where the Neanderthugs get a steady stream of melanin-infused organs for harvesting.</p>
<p>Pah abe confirms melanin-infused organs are superior products by telling us that the bi-racial babies in Haiti are harvested by the wealthy billionaires to be used as body parts. He postulates the Rothchild/Rockerfeller clans need their blood in these donor children so their bodies don’t reject the organs.
That\'s something we can look into.</p>
</blockquote>
<h1></h1>
<p>Some of you will remember, I noted that a reliable source informed us, back in 2010, at the outset of the cholera outbreak that USAID’s first “relief” dollars for the cholera victims went to buy 200,000 body bags!</p>
<p>You may also recall, the incident, when the doctors at Mirebalais we questioned about why the bodies of those who were said to die of cholera were not returned to the families of the cholera victims for at least a funeral? We were suspiciously stonewalled. Then finally told it was because they were getting properly buried by the doctors and staff, in body bags to avoid further contamination of the earth. And when we said why can’t the grieving families attend those funerals or “disposal” activities. No answer.</p>
<p>A great portion of human trafficking happens at oil rigs, at the over 1000 US military basis around the world, and on the high seas for the pleasures of sick oligarchs and their servants who use the women and children and sometimes, discard the bodies at sea. The UN is teeming with pedophiles.</p>
<p>Haiti orphanage Hoax: The Haiti orphanage system, like the US foster-care system, are places where defenseless children are sitting ducks for molesters and all sorts of predators. The pedophiles hide at Haiti orphanages, which are little more than private fund raising instruments for the enrichment of the owners. It’s not about the welfare of the children, but making a living off the misfortunes of abandoned children.</p>
<p>The Jesuits and Vatican in Haiti: The Jesuits and Catholic Church own more land in Haiti than any other entity except for the Haitian government. There’s no doubt their schools, properties and Order of Malta affiliated orphanages and guest houses in Haiti are a hotbed for pedophilia and traumatizing Haiti children not just through their fake history as do-gooders but through rape and sexual molestation.</p>
<p>Haiti is also one of the richest countries in oil, iridium, gold, copper and has mountains after mountains of the most rare earth metals in the world. Although strategically denied by the US-Euro diplomats and over thirty thousand NGOs masturbating on Black pain in Haiti, Èzili’s HLLN regularly details Haiti Riches, way before US client president and prime minister, Michel Martelly and Jean Max Bellerive admitted our wealth while letting the Clintons make us international beggars with fake quake relief.</p>
<p>American Universities that set up shop there do live experiments on children after infecting them with a host of diseases, particularly cholera, then purposely treat the children with vaccines and all sort of trial drugs. After they the experimental children die or are killed, they don’t even return the bodies to the naïve and unsuspecting mothers who just want their children healed from diseases that they infected the kids with in the first place. Worse, they don’t return the bodies to the mothers but sent them in ice bags to the US for study and dissection. Cholera is an infection of choice for those.</p>
<h1></h1>
<p><em>The following is just beyond my comprehension. These poor kids. It\'s just unbelievable...</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Elites such the David Rockefeller impregnate women to harvest organs later out of their own offspring they keep in certain orphanages for securing body parts that will surely not reject their donor bodies when they come back to kill or take out selected organs. A virtual new race of biracial children are now being raised in Haiti for that very purpose of organ harvesting for parents who will never see the children except when the child organs are placed in the parents bodies in their latter years of old age or when in need of new liver or other organ.</p>

            Yeah. I agree. I kept doing it, partly because I feel like fair is fair -- if I'm going to delete someone else's written work, I ought to be willing to put a little work into writing something explaining why. The other reason is that the act of writing out an explanation forces you to take the time to think it through. There has been more than one time when a post I was going to remove because it sounded like shill disinfo I ended up leaving up and downvoating and flairing because I couldn't articulate how it broke a rule.

            I'd love that. We should also spell out the ban policy and add that to the rules at the same time. That was never done. If I just put up a sticky, though, MF is going to take it personally. I'm already stuck between a rock and a hard place with him as it is. Any suggestions?  I doubt people will participate if Crensch does it, for fear of being Crensched, LOL. He's quick on the trigger.

             99% of my bans have been Amalek alts, and the only point of those is to discourage him by making him have to complete captchas and create new account names and passwords.  The rest have been people that were deliberately breaking rules in an antagonizing way.  I would actually be fine with reversing every single existing ban, as I don't think they matter at this point (new accounts are free).  I would prefer that to opening voting on an actual ban "policy."  Think about it.  Would we be simply defining what number of posts about a given topic within a specific amount of time by the same user constitutes spamming?  And then how do you define whether it's a different topic or not? What if it's obvious that it's one person or a group of people maliciously spamming, but using different accounts and "different" topics?  How do you objectively measure deliberateness, antagonism and maliciousness of rule-breaking posts?  I've had plenty of rule-breaking posts complaining about mods where I didn't even think about banning, but others that were over-the-top and I where the poster was showing flagrant disregard for the rules, which obviously called for a ban.  I don't like the idea of introducing a discussion about it.  There are too many shills around would jump on the opportunity to stack the vote, and too many normal users will ignore the vote and the discussion entirely.  I think this needs to be left to the combined right-brain and left-brain of actual mods, not turned into mob rule.

             <p>
              The problem with just naming the rule, MF, is that half the users on here, maybe more than half, are on mobile and never even see the rules. And for those who do realize where to read the rules, it's almost never clear to them which part of the cited rule they screwed up. Even users who have been posting for a while. The rules are complex, especially Rule 1.  Maybe wecanhelp could edit his mod tool plugin so that it quoted the exact part of the rule in question?  I get that you don't want to take any more time than necessary. But the majority of posts are not being made by shills. They're made by decent folks, most of whom are not writers, trying to help bring the Cabal to justice. When their work is summarily deleted with nothing more than a rule number, it confirms everything the shills crow on about and leaves people even more deeply enraged than they were when they discovered pizzagate.

Although I unbanned her twice, she is now too afraid to make submissions in

              and it left her unable to respond to Comments. Numerous other users who saw this could not undertand it, and concluded you were trying to silence her -- feeding right into the agenda of the Amalek alts you'd also banned. With no clear policy, there is no ruler to measure mod conduct against and people assume the worst.

               all I can say is that you knew I was not 'Amalek' because I have had many conversations/comments with you prior to you banning me.  I was left thinking you do it, just because you have the authority to do it, and I am not savvy enough, computer wise, to know what to do about it.  When I asked why you banned me, you didn't have the courtesy to respond to me.  Well you have won.  I rarely post anything anymore, last post a month ago, it takes time to research important information to type up in a post on voat and time to reply to comments, just to have it deleted, even though I want to still help the cause for the sake of the children.   🙁  Again Thank you

                Banning your account doesn't remove your posts, and as I've told you before, you can easily make a new account.  Pretending to be "not computer savvy" seems like absurd cover story, an excuse to whine about being banned instead of even TRYING to explain the reply in the link above, or simply making a new account.  You made your current account, and so you knew how to make another one.  (But of course my belief is that you have hundreds of accounts.).

                 got banned for the Amalek reply, and then I believe sent some messages to modmail requesting an unban. Since you had told me you test-ban suspected Amalek bots and that genuine users will reveal themselves by requesting an unban, I made sure she understood the submission rules and unbanned her. She submitted her post about the Comet hacker. You rebanned her, and she couldn't reply to the comments. I was surprised that you'd rebanned her without removing any rule-breaking posts, so I asked her why you had banned her. She linked me to the
                 <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/v/pizzagate/2117259/10435332">
                  Amalek reply
                 </a>
                 . I looked it over, as well as her Comment and Submission history and saw that she had been pinged by the asshole. I figured she had just clicked the wrong reply button (the Submission Mention) from within her notifications page -- since we had been conversing on several threads simultaneously. It happened on a day that Voat was super laggy and I had accidentally hit the wrong button several times because I was typing faster than the server. I did try to communicate with you about it at the time, and Trisha was trying to communicate with us about the ban through modmail. She was quite confused about the Amalek message, which was also a ban:

                 ban notification mail from you. She got at least three bans in 48 hours -- two from you and one from Amalek -- and was pulling her hair out, unable to post on her hot submission. We talked about always replying from within the thread itself rather than the notification page as a way of avoiding future mixups, and I thought everything was resolved. But then I find out she's afraid to post for fear of being banned again, and you think I'm playing dodgy games and trying to undermine your modding. And I'm annoyed at constantly having to explain your decisions. Dang.
                </p>
                <p>
                 I think all three of us got played by Amalek. He succeeded in sowing distrust and frustration.  I vote we take a breath, recalibrate shill sensors, and begin again with a New Year's resolution to assume the best intent until that assumption is proven false. What do you say? :-)

                 you are WRONG because I have ONLY this ONE voat account!  Why would I want to make another account just because you felt like banning me 'because it pleases you'. I did nothing wrong, and I have tried to follow the Rules, if I make a mistake I admit it and try rectify it.  Fyi, I am not a liar, and this is why I can admit I know little about computers and technology etc, it has nothing to do with sympathy. )I am a granny, not a tranny - reference to your snide comment "hers")

                  Why did you put this in quotes?  I never said that or anything even close to that.  Your assumption of bad faith is just further evidence to me you're lying.  Why are you even still arguing?  Your account is no longer banned!   Aaaaaand you still haven't attempted to explain replying to Vindicator as if you were SimonRothschild1.  That's all I'll be saying about this.  You are not banned now, and I won't be banning you again, so you have nothing to complain about, but I won't be apologizing because I still don't believe you.  You can't blame me because you refuse to even try to explain.  You haven't denied writing that comment, either.

                The problem with just naming the rule, MF, is that half the users on here, maybe more than half, are on mobile and never even see the rules.

               I can see that for Rule 3 (1 and 2 are pretty straight-forward).  I don't see why people can't ask for clarification if they don't understand.  That has been our policy for a while.  You have to understand it's my time you're talking about, and nobody else's.  That time to formulate, type, and submit (on satellite internet no less) an individual explanation for each deletion adds up fast.  I am fine with agreeing to do it as normal procedure now, since post volumes have come down a lot, but I don't support it as a formal rule unless we can get wecanhelp to modify modbar as you suggest.  There is still a possibility/likelihood that shills will start flooding again at times, and barring that modbar modification, I would not want to be required to give an individual explanation at those times.

                The rules are complex, especially Rule 1. Maybe wecanhelp could edit his mod tool plugin so that it quoted the exact part of the rule in question?

               .  This guy is weird and he has openly stated that he has accounts which he crafts to appear like normal users.  Furthermore, "she" never even attempted to explain this "ok thanks" to me.  I'm not saying it was a good decision to ban that account.  It was at a time that I was fed up with Amalek, and I wanted to see how some of the accounts I strongly suspected of being him would react if I banned them.  He initially was able to persuade me to unban TrishaUK, THEN the "ok thanks" happened.  Jem777 is another case of this.  Even though I unbanned that account, he used it against me to paint me as a villain, continuing to use the new Mej777 to remind people he was banned, instead of going back to Jem777.  It was not a good idea to ban them, but I still think they're Amalek.

               No, but I don't think it's wise to make a sticky about it either.  We can make a common-sense policy.  Spamming gets you banned, and repeatedly ignoring rules gets a ban.  Simple.  I don't think it's wise to try to define that too precisely.  Shills would use it against us.

            I very clearly and politely explained how it wasn’t right for my post to be deleted. You allowed me to repost it. I was respectful to everyone. Crensch is the one that started shit by acting like I’m suspicious because I said somebody else that didn’t think my post should have been deleted is someone that Crensch doesn’t like.
           </p>
           <p>
            So, don’t act like you guys are attacked. I’ve never even dealt with any of you guys until yesterday. All was fine until Crensch started his immature disrespectful rant. I go out of my way to thank you for what you did, but tell you how it’s messed up allowing Crensch to keep talking shit to me after you told me to leave him alone. Your response is I’m doing whiny Reddit bullshit.
           </p>
           <p>
            Obviously you guys don’t act out only because you’re attacked or disrespected. You guys start it. Now I can see why people do not act respectful to you guys. You’ll get respect when you give respect. Until then, this place will continue to go downhill.

            Pointing out his tone?  Nope, she is pointing out something that has been pointed out many times.  Being degrading and hostile in the most obscene language he can muster is much more than 'tone'.  But as usual, bringing up an issue that has been brought up before is brushed off.  Some of us are not fooled and that number grows.

            Users are invited, and given advice, on how to make a post to dispute a removal, and almost invariably, all they do is attack MF.

            want to be treated with?  How about following the RULES and not making a post

             disputing
            </em>
            the removal in the same subverse, therefore breaking the rules

            This is what this "user" writes.  After NOT sending a msg to the mods, NOT pinging me - If that's not fishy, I don't really know what is.

            It doesn’t matter. At least you were better than the others. You saw that the post shouldn’t be deleted and you fought for it. So I thank you for that. You didn’t call me names. I don’t know which one of you guys are in charge over the others. I know the O’s are above the mods. I don’t even know who you are except an O (owner?) of other subs. But, it’s pretty sad that it seems like nobody is in charge of keeping you guys fair.
           </p>
           <p>
            This sub isn’t a gaming sub or something. This sub’s purpose actually has meaning. For the most part, there are good people here who truly care for children and would like to see these evil sicko’s arrested. This isn’t the type of place I would expect to be moderated by people who call the members faggots and told to fuck off. You say you guys are just users. But, I would think the users you would have in that position would be mature enough to handle issues without it turning an issue into some ridiculous show of disrespect and verbal assault.
           </p>
           <p>
            There are people here everyday trying to help. We could spend our time doing more enjoyable things but we come back everyday because we give a damn. We put up with haters constantly. To be accused of being a suspicious person for no reason isn’t right. Sometimes we are treated like the enemy. Instead of people realizing that we all share a common goal and should stick together, it’s clear that many aren’t here for the right reasons. For the ones that are, we don’t deserve to be treated disrespectfully and called names. Especially not by the ones moderating the forum.
           </p>
           <p>
            Anyway, you were far more helpful than the others, but you continue to not even address Crensch’s immature disrespectful verbal attacks on others. Not only that, but you told me to back off of Crensch. But, you don’t tell him to back off of me? That speaks volumes.

            Look fellas this is getting old.  Legitimate concerns about this sub are met with trashy mouth juvenile replies/this is not the first time.  It's your sub/your tone.  If when this post was first removed MF had bothered to dialogue with the op/any misunderstandings clarified/none of this would have happened.  There were many who took issue with the removal of this thread.  When members have questions they are treated like shit.  But it's how you roll...so keep on rolling.

            Oh ok. I have been leaving Crensch alone. He’s talking to me like a guy so to show how he obviously doesn’t know me, I tell him i’m Not a dude! Everyone that knows me here is aware because me and Donkeyhote fight all the time. He tells us women how we’re stupid cunts and whores. So, it’s no secret that I’m female.

            Also, you can see why these doctors are dropping like flies. Tied to CF and organ transplant. Lastest was a surgeon in Manhattan that went Haiti and wrote memo voicing complaints. Always tying up loose ends like billionaire in Canada who also involved with vaccines in Haiti and CF.  Killing and sterilization is also their MO for these poor people all over the world. Think WHO, USAID, UN and all the bogus eye clinics, kidney clinics, etc.  Thanks to

             "Voat is compromised" -- Shareblue talking point, confirmed. Thanks for building up this community.

             There is only one admin, 4; PuttItOut. He is god of this little realm and can probably do whatever the hell he wants. He doesn't have time to diddle with voats, however. He has been working round the clock these past three months to protect one of the only free speech platforms left on the internet, from being shut down via DDoS and financial suppression by the "powerful people" we have "really pissed off." I stickied his post on the matter. Try reading.

              I recall when the financial issue came up.  Many goats asked/tried to find out who owns voat.  Don't think that question was ever resolved.  If it was can you share it here (not in blue of course).

               PuttItOut owns Voat. It used to be Putt and Atko, but Atko got burned out. Putt was looking for an angel investor until he realized there wasn't anyone that could be trusted to preserve it as a free speech platform against those who don't want us documenting their dirty secrets. At that point, he decided to rewrite the code so it could be hosted and maintained cheaply enough to survive on user donations -- which he's been working on for months.

             shows even the merest sign of fallibility. As I already said, MF did have grounds to remove it, though he didn't cite the correct rule. You are projecting your own interpretation onto my words.

              This.  Sometimes I'm in a hurry and don't click carefully when indicating which rule was broken, partly because there is significant overlap between the rules.

              I read the submission at the time, then it was suddenly taken down and I looked at your discussion with MF in order to find out why it was deleted. I had no idea there was a wider context.

               Fair enough. In my opinion, this sub would work a lot better if we had more people actively modding than MF and I, and we split the time responsibility up to limit the burden (and fuck up potential) of post removal and spread it around. As it stands now, neither MF or I ever have a day off. That tends to lead to snafus and suboptimal decisions.

               <p>
                I have seen many dedicated researchers leave, because they were frustrated that good posts were deleted by MF. They regarded it as censorship (on Voat, of all places!). This also has invoked a slight feeling of paranoia that Voat, after all, could be compromised.

           <p>
            "Deutsche Bank Americas recently hosted an event at 60 Wall Street to bring awareness to the cholera epidemic in Haiti and to highlight its support of Haiti’s first permanent cholera treatment center, which is being built by MASS Design Group and Centre GHESKIO. The event featured remarks from Chelsea Clinton, Vice President of the Clinton Foundation, as well as representatives from MASS Design and Centre GHESKIO and Gary Hattem, President of the Deutsche Bank Americas Foundation and Managing Director of the Community Development Finance Group. Deutsche Bank has committed a $265,000 grant in support of the center.
           </p>
           <p>
            Located in Port-au-Prince, the Cholera Treatment Center will help to address the worst cholera outbreak in recent history. Introduced by foreign recovery workers following the 2010 earthquake, the ongoing disease epidemic in Haiti to date has resulted in around 670,000 cases and caused 8,217 deaths according to the Center for Disease Control and Prevention. The outbreak has been exacerbated by a common lack of access to basic sanitation and clean drinking water, as well as the breakdown of infrastructure due to the earthquake."

            Cholera outbreak on Bill Clinton's watch!
           </p>
           <p>
            UN Admits: Bill Clinton-Run Haiti Mission ‘Played Role’ in Cholera Outbreak by SAMUEL MAXIME31 Aug 2016 “Over the past year, the U.N. has become convinced that it needs to do much more regarding its own involvement in the initial outbreak and the suffering of those affected by cholera,” UN secretary general deputy spokesman Farhan Haq said, the New York Times reports.
           </p>
           <p>
            Still, the global organization appears to be fighting any possibility of paying damages and, just as alarming to observers, the Obama administration has remained silent on the matter.
           </p>
           <p>
            Bill Clinton was head of the United Nations mission to Haiti at the time and managing billions in earthquake reconstruction money when, in October of 2010, a base of soldiers from Nepal began dumping septic waste into the country’s main river. The Artibonite River, located in the town of Mirebalais, is the island of Hispaniola’s longest and most important river. Located in the heart of island, the contaminated water ran through other rivers, creating a stream of death through Haiti’s waterways."

            Doctors Without Borders/ Rockefeller connection: Heir to Rockefeller Fortune Dies in New York Plane Crash June 14, 2014 11:25
           </p>
           <p>
            "An heir to the Rockefeller fortune has been killed in a plane crash in New York, the billionaire family has announced.
           </p>
           <p>
            Richard Rockefeller died when his plane, a single-engine Piper Meridian turboprop, crashed in foggy weather just minutes after taking off from an airport near White Plains in Westchester county, New York."
           </p>
           <p>
            Richard Rockefeller was the son of philanthropist David Rockefeller Sr and the great-grandson of oil tycoon and philanthropst John D Rockefeller.
           </p>
           <p>
            He had been returning from New York where he had been celebrating his father's 99th birthday on Thursday. The aircraft came down less than a mile away from the airport, striking trees and missing a house in Harrison by only a few feet, according to police and airport officials. US safety agencies have launched an investigation.
           </p>
           <p>
            Airport manager Peter Scherrer said Rockefeller, 65, was the only passenger on the aircraft when it crashed at 8:08 a.m. The plane disappeared from radar and authorities lost contact with the pilot. At 8:23 a.m. police were notified that a plane had crashed in the hamlet of Purchase, Scherrer said. Visibility during this time was "very low" at around a quarter of a mile, he added.
           </p>
           <p>
            Anthony Marraccini, Harrison police chief, told Bloomberg News: "The plane was broken into pieces, and some pieces were lodged in pine trees. Some of the main fuselage remained intact."
           </p>
           <p>
            A Rockefeller family statement, released by a family spokesperson, said: "This is a terrible tragedy. The family is in shock. Richard was a wonderful and cherished son, brother, husband, father and grandfather. He was an experienced pilot and respected medical doctor. It is just horribly sad."
           </p>
           <p>
            According to his biography on the Rockefeller Brothers Fund website Rockefeller was a practising doctor until 2000 and taught medicine in Maine from 1982 until 2000. He was president of the Health Commons Institute, a non-profit organisation dedicated to improving medicine in America, and chairman of the US Advisory Board of the medical aid charity Doctors Without Borders from 1989 until 2010.
           </p>
           <p>
            Victoria Bjorklund, a Doctors Without Borders founding volunteer, said: "Richard was so committed to the principles of Doctors Without Borders -- the belief that everyone had the right to access medical care. He was absolutely critical in sharing those principles with a wide array of supporters at a time when the organisation was not well known in the US. He will be sorely missed.""

            Dr. Richard Rockefeller, Founding Member of Doctors Without Borders USA, Dies in Plane Crash June 13, 2014
           </p>
           <p>
            "NEW YORK—June 13, 2014—Doctors Without Borders/Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) was deeply saddened to learn of the tragic death of Richard Rockefeller, Ed.M., M.D., who was killed today when the single-engine plane that he was piloting crashed outside of Westchester County Airport, and extends its deepest sympathies and condolences to his family.
           </p>
           <p>
            Through his vast philanthropic network, passionate public speaking on the right for access to medicines, and field assignments in South America, Africa, and Southeast Asia, Dr. Rockefeller was instrumental to the founding of MSF in the United States. In 1989, working with his father David Rockefeller, Dr. Rockefeller helped MSF establish its roots in the United States by hosting a small start-up team at 30 Rockefeller Center, inside the offices of Rockefeller &amp; Co.
           </p>
           <p>
            “Richard gave so much of his life to support Doctors Without Borders,” said Dr. Deane Marchbein, MD, president of MSF-USA. “He made so many vital contributions that have helped Doctors Without Borders provide independent medical humanitarian assistance to millions of patients in over 70 countries. The entire Doctors Without Borders family extends its profound condolences to Richard’s family. We are devastated by his loss.”"

               "After seeing the success of the GHESKIO Cholera Treatment Center – which localizes and decentralizes sanitation, health, and water services – MASS partnered with the Pershing Square Foundation to investigate if the model could be scaled to address additional communities struggling with waterborne diarrheal diseases. Over a period of three months, MASS worked with community health workers, community leaders, local nonprofit organizations, and government officials to assess the feasibility of a community-based water and wastewater sanitation system in one of the biggest slums in Port-au-Prince. The proposed model offers an alternative solution to centralized subterranean sanitation and sewerage infrastructure as yet to be implemented across Haiti."

               Ackman's returns make him a top 20 fund manager
"Billionaire activist investor Bill Ackman has been named one of the world's top 20 hedge fund managers for the first time, after posting stellar outperformance in 2014 led by his bet on botox maker Allergan.
Ackman broke into rankings, compiled by LCH Investments, at number 19, after his firm, Pershing Square, delivered $4.5 billion in net gains for investors last year. The figure brings the fund's lifetime gains to $11.6 billion since its launch in 2004."
"Sopher, who is also head of alternative multi-management at exclusive private bank, Edmond de Rothschild, said Pershing Square's results were "outstanding" as "gains have mostly come from intelligent investing in liquid big cap U.S. stocks.""

              There was no reason to delete it. You should have made a sticky instead to remember the beginning of the pizzagate investigation on Voat.

               There were no submission rules when that post was made, so unsurprisingly it doesn't adhere to them. However,

                @Millennial_Falcon
               </a>
               should have cited Rule 4 for removing that because it's not a research post, it's a housekeeping post.

               This brings up a great question, though, which perhaps our O's (

              </p>
              <p>
               If a new post meets Rules 1, 2 and 3 like this Searchvote historical repost, but the original post linked doesn't because it predates the ruleset, do we delete? And if no, what's to keep forum sliders from digging up the shitposts of yore (that led to the ruleset in the first place) and reposting with a title that mentions pizzagate and a link to the original?

             I have never complained to you or about you Crensch. I’ve never even talked to you. I have no idea what you are suspicious of. Are you going to explain what you mean by being suspicious of me? I would like to be able to address any questions you have. If anything, I am too open about myself here.

              is a known shitstirrer, and if I'm not mistaken, you used him as a support for your argument against the deletion.
             </p>
             <p>
              The link in your OP didn't ring true for me, and while you may not know, or care, what that means, many of the users here have grown accustomed to me smelling something fishy - turns out I'm usually right.

               Esoteric may sometimes be a shit stirrer, but he/she is a good researcher and the real deal when it comes to wanting to expose this crap. Being a shit stirrer doesn't void the actual legitimacy of the work

               I used a FEW people that didn’t think that my post should have been deleted to support my argument. It seems to me that using that as a reason to be suspicious of me when you and I have never had a problem before is making YOU the shit stirrer.
              </p>
              <p>
               Of all things posted on pizzagate, THIS link doesn’t ring true for you? Maybe links to
               <a href="http://crazydaysandnights.net">
                http://crazydaysandnights.net
               </a>
               that is constantly used here is more your style? Or how about fake news site
               <a href="http://yournewswire.com">
                http://yournewswire.com
               </a>
               ? Yeah, both of those are used here and stay up. Or hell, people that just post a link to a tweet? I see those stay up all the time.
              </p>
              <p>
               But I am someone to be suspicious of? 🙄 Suspcious of what? That I’m CIA? Omg shareblue? DynCorp? Lol, you’re standing up for yo boy MF!
              </p>
              <p>
               From what I’ve heard, most users here do NOT agree with you.
