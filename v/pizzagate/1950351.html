            What offense they base this on, I'd like to know. I'm sure it's there as shit, but if it's Virginia Roberts, that's massive, no more doubt about Clinton-Epstein.
           </p>

            I think that Bill Clinton shoulda not listened to Larry King (the CNN guy), there's a youtube video from when Clinton was campaigning in 1992 on the Larry King show, hot-mike during commercials, that Jeffrey Epstein would very much like to meet him, that he told Larry King that. Clinton in his youthful kind of "trust-no one" old kind of behaviour is like "Has he?". That's pretty much all there is to it, I don't know if the video is still there, I didn't even know who Jeff Epstein was then, I got to know some time after that though, I remember just looking for some info about Epstein and found the Opperman's Report podcast interview with Pearse Redmond and man those guys are pros in their research, in fact Redmond's solo radio show he did a couple years ago which is still on youtube, unlike his partner Tom Secker who only puts his videos on Vimeo because he doesn't want any of the retarded youtube comments polluting his work, Pearse doesn't care really, he cares more about the comments left on the sites about his shows. But yeah, you guys listen to that Opperman Report interview with Pearse Redmond about Epstein, you'll learn stuff, some of you. Some here are as good researchers as Ed or Pearse but don't have podcasts and radio shows (Opperman is actually on actual AM and FM stations, rarely simulcasted, but when somebody swears he puts the interview only on spreaker or his member's section which has a lot of good stuff too. Not spamming by the way, just pointing at 2 guys who know their stuff big time.

             Nope.  King approached Clinton saying that Ted Turner, Larry King's boss, wanted to meet him (Clinton).

              Well Ted Turner is one creepy reclusive guy who bought 1/4 of southern Argentina, in Patagonia (a beautiful region in Argentina and Chile), a friend went skiing there and at some point there was a lake, it said Turner Lake and that it was private property in spanish....unbelievable...but he bought that area when Argentina's economy was torn to shreds...actually the first victim...actually happened pre-9/11.

              Uhm...I can't watch now, in fact I just woke up way too early and amd just taking a Sonata with an orange juice glass. But I'm sure some mention of Epstein is made.

            The article seems to say a google search yielding a lot of results constitutes evidence.  Here are a few fun ones I tried as counterexamples.
           </p>
           <p>
            richard gere gerbil 81,100 results
moon landing fake 2.2 million results
pizzagate is fake 1.2 million results
earth is flat 112 million results
           </p>
           <p>
            I'm not saying Bill Clinton is guilty or innocent of any crime.  I have no idea.  I'm just saying the way you find out is to do real research, not count google hits.
