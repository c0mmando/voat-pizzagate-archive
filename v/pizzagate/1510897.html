<p><strong>Idea specifics</strong>: A few Voaters Would create multiple in person MeetUps for their state (or region, if outside the US) at a library or public place initially. Taking a state or region, keeps everyone more anonymous and does not give away your specific location. </p>
<p>Once you volunteer to take a state or area, look up the major hubs and create MeetUps (surely there\'s something better? Looking for ideas on that) across the area you chose moderate. Of course, one of those will be within driving distance to you so you have an in-person group. </p>
<p>After a few weeks/months of members  gathering together, no more (or minimal..whatever is collectively decided in the group) coordination is done over the Internet and groups work independantly based on their schedules. </p>
<p><strong>During in person MeetUps, we would:</strong>
-plan ways to advertise to our area
-divide and conquer the hanging of posters
-work together in investigating in person
-tech savvy people could advise others
-find allies in case the internet is censored at some point
-discuss current developments
-encourage each other 
-pretty much a redpill party :) (maybe we should title them that...haha)</p>
<p><strong>Pros:</strong>
-keeps us more independent from the web so that if the government goes on a virtual witch hunt we don\'t all go down with voat
-encouragement 
-we know our communities and what key words will help them become redpilled easier</p>
<p><strong>Cons/issues to work through:</strong>
-how would we stay safe?
-how could we keep shills out?
-maybe no one is in my/your area
-is MeetUp a good service to use initially?
-internet connects us with more people than in person would</p>
<p>That\'s all I have for now. Please shoot holes in my idea and offer up suggestions! This may be a difficult thing to start, but I think it will benefit us long term for support as we see the US imploding.</p>',
