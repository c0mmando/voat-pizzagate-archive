<blockquote>
<p>I don\'t remember.  I don\'t remember investigations on those topics.  I remember at one point receiving an email from someone, a private citizen, to my personal account, raising issues about the --- is it Ping Pong?  Whatever the pizza place was that was involved in some conspiracy theories.  I remember sending it to my staff saying, make sure this gets to the appropriate place, but I don\'t know whether there were investigations.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The email on his personal account that he is referring to was acquired through a FOIA request:</p>
<p><a href="https://media.8ch.net/file_store/ca5792b8e6531af76d5dfb36d03c8f1b619b9a3ba70cfc80a72bbff8e6134e0a.jpg">https://media.8ch.net/file_store/ca5792b8e6531af76d5dfb36d03c8f1b619b9a3ba70cfc80a72bbff8e6134e0a.jpg</a></p>
<p>We have another misstep by Comey in that it was already mentioned in the IG report that he was ignoring crimes against children, specifically.</p>
<p><a href="http://fbnewscycle.com/ig-report-shows-comey-ignored-sex-crimes-against-children-in-order-to-let-hillary-off-the-hook-no-political-bias-my/">http://fbnewscycle.com/ig-report-shows-comey-ignored-sex-crimes-against-children-in-order-to-let-hillary-off-the-hook-no-political-bias-my/</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Crime Against Children.  This one really seriously sucks.  Seriously. He ignored sexual abuse committed against children when there had been copious amounts of evidence already in the public square about both Clintons in this regard.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So, Comey is caught in the lie that he doesn\'t really know about any of this, particularly since he was given the names of the agents in charge. Mueller appointees, Andrew Vale and Paul Abbate. So, not only was there an investigation ongoing, with two people in charge of it, Comey was given their names and he knows them. He seems to know Paul on a first name basis on the email, who specializes in IT.</p>
<p>The problem is that this email can be read two ways. A person sends an email to Comey\'s personal account, asking for a favor, but not really stating what the favor is. Are these investigators supposed to investigate Comet Ping Pong? Or are they supposed to squash criticism of it?</p>
<p>The person sending the email is referred to by Comey as a &quot;very serious woman.&quot;</p>
<p>Comet Ping Pong held fundraisers for the school in question.</p>
<p>So, we have a simple puzzle. Which school had 2 - 3 fundraisers at Comet Ping Pong?</p>
<p>My first instinct was that Alice Waters of Edible Schoolyards was the one who sent the email on behalf of one of the schools in her program. James Alefantis is on the Board. My Edible Schoolyard posts have been deleted by the mods in this sub, so I gave up on trying to tell anyone about it back in April.</p>
<p>The reason I jumped to this conclusion is because they had a &quot;Solstice&quot; fundraiser where they made $167,000. Another fundraiser was for someone 41st birthday party. Alefantis is the likely organizer.</p>
<p>Edible Schoolyards has connections to a number of schools named &quot;Monarch&quot; where they have made gardens.</p>
<p><a href="http://monarchacademy.org/global/">http://monarchacademy.org/global/</a></p>
<p>Monarch Academy</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Monarch Academy public charter schools are tuition-free public charter schools with three different locations in Baltimore City, Glen Burnie, Annapolis and Laurel, Maryland. Each school aims to educate students to be self-motivated, creative, critical thinkers and life-long learners who are productive contributors to the global community in the 21st century. At Monarch Academy, children are encouraged to think critically; question; reflect; and participate in a rigorous, highly interactive instructional program that integrates arts and technology across the curriculum.</p>

<p>If Andy Vale and Paul were in charge of cleaning this up, a conversation started in Comey\'s personal email, then maybe we are looking at an opportunity to do some &quot;clean up&quot; under the guise of a shooting right next door. The timing lines up. The coincidences are strong.</p>

            BOOK DRIVE &amp; DINE OUT: JANUARY 27, 2018
           </p>
           <p>
            In January, join us at a day-long Book Drive at Politics and Prose in Washington, DC. At
this event, all P&amp;P customers can request that a percentage of their receipts be directed to
Grace Episcopal Day School’s PTO.
In the week before the book drive, Grace faculty compile lists of books that they would
like to see added to their classroom shelves. During the book drive, those lists are available
so families, friends, and other P&amp;P customers can purchase books for our classrooms.
The PTO makes sure faculty receive their donations.
Throughout the book drive, the Grace PTO also collects new books for the Homeless Children’s
Playtime Project, a non-profit organization whose mission is to is to nurture
healthy child development and reduce the effects of trauma among children living in
temporary housing programs in Washington D.C.
While shopping for your children and your classrooms during the book drive, be sure to
pick up some books for this worthy organization that always says “yes” when a child asks
to take a book with him or her.
After finishing your Politics &amp; Prose shopping, refuel with a lunch or dinner stop at Comet
Ping Pong, just steps away. Write “Grace” on your Comet Ping Pong receipt and a portion
of the tab will be donated back to the Grace PTO. Coordinate your timing with
friends and make it a party! It’s an easy (and delicious) way to support the PTO and our
fundraising efforts.
Service opportunities at this event:
 One hour shift at information table at Politics &amp; Prose

              It was pulled because your headline was misleading, and the body of the next needed some editing, too. :-) You can submit tons of posts about the Edible Schoolyard project if you like, as you well know, and they won't get deleted if they adhere to the rules. Nice try. :-)

              Yes, thank you. I overlooked it because the term 'Edible Schoolyard' wasn't in the headline. Your post was deleted, since it wasn't edited.
             </p>
             <p>
              Was there another post by you that was deleted? Since you said 'My Edible Schoolyard posts have been deleted' (plural)?

            A Sample of Monarch Academy Expeditions:
Kindergarten Studies the Origins of Pizza
What could be more familiar for children aged 5 and 6 than pizza? For Monarch Academy kindergarten teachers, this common food served as an ideal expedition for their students. The objective: to understand how the ingredients used to make pizza get from the farm and are transformed into the pizza ingredients we are all familiar with—cheese, sauce and the crust.

             Related because it is a redacted email that has Comet ping pong listed as well as favor, and school. Certain people in our government have read the unredacted version and probably put 2 and 2 together here. Sounds seriously iffy even redacted.
