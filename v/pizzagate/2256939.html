<p>This is a follow-up to my previous post on Crown Prince Mohammed Bin Salman and the purge going on in Saudi Arabia. I alerted everyone and suggested that a pact had been made with the POTUS. Don\'t know if that is true, but the fact American mercenaries were called in seems to indicate some sort of deal. As for the purge, it\'s getting worse. Alwaleed was hung upside down by his feet to send a message, but a message to who?</p>
<p>Here are the highlights: </p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-5108651/American-mercenaries-torturing-Saudi-princes.html">http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-5108651/American-mercenaries-torturing-Saudi-princes.html</a></p>
<h1>EXCLUSIVE: \'American mercenaries are torturing\' Saudi elite rounded up by new crown prince - and billionaire Prince Alwaleed was hung upside down \'just to send a message\'</h1>
<ul>
<li>Source in Saudi Arabia says American private security contractors are carrying out\'interrogations\' on princes and billionaires arrested in crackdown </li>
<li>Detained members of Saudi elite have been hung by their feet and beaten by interrogates, source says</li>
<li>Among those hung upside down are Prince Alwaleed bin Talal, an investor worth at least $7 billion who is being held at Riyadh\'s Ritz Carlton</li>
<li>Arrests were ordered three weeks ago by Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman</li>
<li>Source claims mercenaries are from \'Blackwater\', a claim also made by Lebanese president</li>
<li>But its successor firm denies it has any operations in Saudi Arabia whatsoever and says its staff abide by U.S. law</li>
<li>Americans who commit torture abroad can be jailed for up to 20 years</li>
</ul>
<p>The group of the country\'s most powerful figures were arrested in a crackdown ordered by Crown Prince Mohammed Bin Salman three weeks ago as he ordered the detention of at least 11 fellow princes and hundreds of businessmen and government officials over claims of corruption.</p>
<p>Just last month, the Crown Prince vowed to restore \'moderate, open Islam\' in the kingdom and relaxed a number of its ultra-conservative rules, including lifting a ban on women driving.</p>
<p>DailyMail.com can disclose that the arrests have been followed by \'interrogations\' which a source said were being carried out by \'American mercenaries\' brought in to work for the 32-year-old crown prince, who is now the kingdom\'s most powerful figure.</p>
<p>\'They are beating them, torturing them, slapping them, insulting them. They want to break them down,\' the source told DailyMail.com. </p>
<p>\'Blackwater\' has been named by DailyMail.com\'s source as the firm involved, and the claim of its presence in Saudi Arabia has also been made on Arabic social media, and by Lebanon\'s president. </p>
<p>\'They\'ve transferred all the guys from Abu Dhabi. Now they are in charge of everything,\' said the source.   
</p>
<p>The source said that Salman, often referred to by his initials MBS, is conducting some of the interrogations himself.</p>
<p>\'When it\'s something big he asks them questions,\' the source said.</p>
<p>\'He speaks to them very nicely in the interrogation, and then he leaves the room, and the mercenaries go in. The prisoners are slapped, insulted, hung up, tortured.\'</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So a huge shake-up is going on over there. MBS is after something and until he finds out what it is, this most definitely will continue. And while the article states that he wants to:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>uncover an alleged network of foreign officials who have taken bribes from Saudi princes. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Is this network the human trafficking network? I feel strongly it is. Human trafficking takes in billions of dollars a year, and anything that profitable is sure to be at the top of the list. If there were dalliances and more formal contracts, I\'m wondering the names of those complicit. Definitely keep your eyes on this because this is going to get hotter.</p>

            This is interesting because Soros is Hungarian. Hungary flatly resisted open borders and immigration by building a fence to ward off Soro's immigration flood. If this is true our State Department is going to attempt to take out Orban who was against the immigration. Not sure what is really going on here behind the scenes though.

             Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman has denounced Iran's supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei as the "new Hitler of the Middle East", as tensions simmer between the regional rivals.
            </p>
            <p>
             Saudi Arabia and its arch-rival Iran have traded a bitter war of words after a missile fired from Yemen was intercepted near Riyadh airport on November 4. The missile was claimed by Yemen's Tehran-backed Huthi rebels.
            </p>
            <p>
             Iran's "supreme leader is the new Hitler of the Middle East", Prince Mohammed told The New York Times in an interview published Thursday.

            If this is all true this is a massive cash grab that will number in the upper hundreds of billions of dollars. If this is true they are taking shares in Aramco, the Saud family oil company, which is the largest oil IPO in the world when it hits the market. Also taking their cash and tangible assets that can be liquidated.

            One rival faction of the family stole the throne from the legit heir, the grandson of King Saud if I am interpreting all this correctly.

            Since BBC has supposedly been allowed access this spectacle will be used later for some big purpose because they will not let this drama go to waste.

             A BBC reporter and film crew has gained rare access inside Riyadh's "gilded cage" - the Ritz-Carlton which became a luxury prison after a dozen or more princes were detained during the shocking events which began with Crown Prince Mohammad bin Salman's (MbS) internal purge on November 4th.

           <blockquote>
            <p>
             BBC's tour was "facilitated" under highly controlled and coordinated conditions, as initial photographs and short cell phone videos produced during the first few days of the crackdown revealed harsher and more restricted conditions as princes and/or their staff were forced to sleep on the floor camp-style in the middle of the luxury hotel's lobby.
            </p>
            <p>
             According to the new BBC broadcast from inside the Ritz-Carlton, the princes are desperately scrambling to cut deals through their lawyers in order to secure release, this as new unconfirmed reports of torture have emerged:
            </p>
            <p>
             When people were brought here around midnight on November 4th they were understandably angry. Some of them thought it would just be a show and it wouldn't last. And then when they realized they were here to stay they were furious. Almost everyone here - 95% I was told - are willing to make a deal, to give back what are said to be substantial sums of money in order to get out of here.

             One businessman had tens of millions of Saudi riyals withdrawn from his account after he signed. In another case, a former senior official consented to hand over ownership of four billion riyals worth of shares, the source said.

            <p>
             The Saudi government earlier this week moved from freezing accounts to issuing instructions for “expropriation of unencumbered assets” or seizure of assets, said a second source familiar with the situation.

             Though Western governments and media by and large continue towing the line of a healthy and necessary anti-graft crackdown underway, recent geopolitical tensions involving Lebanese PM Saad Hariri's release and return to Lebanon, as well as the Saudi war on Yemen and threatening rhetoric directed at Iran clearly demonstrate the glaring falsehood of the official narrative which is limited to fairy tale notions of "the visionary reformer prince".
            </p>
            <p>
             And no less than the US Treasury Secretary, Steven Mnuchin, is aggressively promoting this line, who when asked last week about agreements to hand over wealth for detainees’ freedom, told CNBC: “I think that the Crown Prince (Mohammed bin Salman) is doing a great job at transforming the country.”
            </p>
            <p>
             Meanwhile the Saudi internal arrests have caused economic turmoil in some unlikely places. Middle East Eye this week reported that the largely under-reported arrest of billionaire businessman "Sheikh" Mohammed Hussein al-Amoudi threatens to "disrupt the economy of an entire country" - Ethiopia, which lies over 1000 km away. Amoudi is an Ethiopian-Saudi dual citizen with an estimated net worth of about $11 billion according to a 2016 Forbes profile.

              Bingo. If I said millions I meant Billions. And Aramco oil will be a two trillion dollar IPO. This is one of the biggest thefts in history going on in the Saudi family and we can bet our bottom dollar that the Trump administration is neck deep in preferred Aramco shares and this is why the "bad saudis" rubbish is being pushed. Our government officials are getting filthy rich by causing regime change in Saudia Arabia.

                  Didn't know that. That was a Clinton stronghold. What is your tl;dr on that? Just another move to strip the Clinton/Bush cabal of that piece of the pie?

                  I guess the best outcome of this would be if the new gangster faction, Kushner/Trump knocks out the pedosatanic blood drinking faction. That way we would just be left with regular old gangsters that don't fuck kids and drink their blood.

               And considering what we are discovering it looks like the Kushner/Trump faction stepped in front of the Clinton/Bush faction and stole their share of the coming 2 Trillion dollar IPO that will take place, and will get some of the confiscated wealth of the arrested Saudis.
              </p>
              <p>
               Of course I am just guessing here but if I were a Kushner gangster that is exactly what I would do. And Kushner, personally, went to Saudia Arabia not too long ago and so did Trump.
              </p>
              <p>
               The picture is getting clearer. And in comes Q to leave the impression that the Trump administration is wiping out the NWO, Rothschild banking, Soros, etc....
              </p>
              <p>
               Soros just transferred 11 billion dollars in what some people are calling a massive tax dodge. There is some serious stuff going on but I do not understand it all yet, but we will as time passes.

            Well they brought in corrupt american mercenaries to torture their corrupt business men for information... something tells me these men will die during interrogation without "telling" anything. At least the ones that are willing to talk will.

             I'm decidedly not "for" torture, but I don't know exactly what's being done or why so it's hard for me to get as upset as I should ... if I should. I don't know what they're suspected of doing which makes trying to guess why the torture is being meted out dicey ... to say the least.

               True. But they would be able to perform the task at hand. The mercenaries are not going to do anything more than what they're hired to do.

              This is a prime example of why people troll you! You are incapable of engaging in dialogue or seeing anyone else's point of view. Why don't you strengthen your argument if someone doesn't agree with you instead of using these childish tactics?

              No, many of the people you label "shills" are simply people who you were a totally dick to and threw a temper tantrum when they didn't agree with you on something or called out a weak point you made. As a result of your inability to have a dialogue or back up your point you cried "shill" and blocked them. Now it's just fun to troll your lame Crybaby ass!!!

            More evidence of what a complete scumbag Trump is. He endorses the illegal extrajudicial detainment and torture of Saudi nationals at the hands of American mercenaries at the behest of the Saudi strongman prince. Qoute "Some of those they are harshly treating have been milking their country for years!" ....More evidence that the cabal wants you to think Trump is their enemy while he carries out their agenda of war, illegal criminal international behavior and serveilance state conduct. He has been in lock step with the cabal he is a part of yet the Trump vs the Deep state psyop continues to fool even many in here. On top of that they have effectively fooled the truth community into thinking revelations of DC and Hollywood crude behavior is akin to taking down Pizzagate. Their game always works on most of you because your need to feel good about how things are and your need to have hope. Because of that, you do nothing and wait for the cabal to shut itself down from within. Never going to happen. No children are being saved as we speak. Defund the banks if you want to make a start. Or continue posting how "Breaking, it's starting".

             Are you forgetting that Alwaleed has connections to 9/11 and that he made a fortune off the terrorist attack? He also has ties to human trafficking.
            </p>
            <p>
             Trump has been forthright in stating he'd like terrorists and pedos/human traffickers (and some would argue pedo/human traffickers are terrorists and one in the same) to Gitmo which means that he approves of some methods of physicality for certain crimes. This has not been a secret. And many align themselves with this type of stance. So these elite aren't being tortured because they didn't pay their taxes. There's something much more insidious being rooted out.

              The Saudis did not do 9/11, Mossad and the CIA did it and Trump is friends with and endorses several 9/11 criminals like Silverstein and Giuliani. Who are you kidding? the Saudis? Did you get that from Michael Moore's limited hangout movie? They had a finnancial role but Trump is not for punishing those responsible for 9/11. This forum is limited hangout central. You guys are either new or intentionaly misleading. If Trump wants to get the terroist he shoudl arrest the CIA and declare war on Israel unless they turn over their Mossad agents. Your rediculous story is just that.

                YOU make no sense. Why would you torture somebody profitting from it instead of those doing it? See how pointless your observations are? Trump ignores those doing it and thinks it is good to punish those "profitting" from it? Keep your promisse about blocking me, my IQ drops every time I read your post.

              "Some of those they are harshly treating have been milking their country for years!" That implies that he thinks it is deserved. Quit trying to defend him at every turn. He is one of the most blatant cabal members we have ever put in the white House. Jesuit, buddies with 9/11 criminals, blames Saudis, business connections with Mossad, CIA and NY MOB, tied to the Rockefellers, NYC billionaire, Epstein buddy who spent time on pedo island, allowed one of his female staff from Mar a Lago to be recruited by Epsetein, Son in Law is an occultist who owns the 666 buidling where Lucent tech makes the RFD chip in the wrist for the NWO agenda, long time Clinton buddy and admirer, became president. At this point I can only assume the accounts in here sellling us Trump are disinfo. There really is no other conclusion. This place is infested with shills.

               I don't know if any of that is true. I do know he flew on the Epstein plane ONCE. Maybe once was all it took to show him what a bad guy that was. Maybe he wanted to see for himself if the rumors were true? As for the rest, don't know. What I do know is you've been screeching about Trump for a pretty long time. We had one other choice for POTUS if you recall. Trump ain't perfection but he's definitely better than her. And I think he's doing a stand up job considering all the roadblocks in his way. SO...I'll support him (or whomever) I want. Stop telling me what to do. 😏

            That would be BAD if you are correct. You've reported t this to all major news media outlets right? What, specifically do you want me to do? Fatty?. I have limited (but vast) resources.

              You? I'm just following up. it seemed urgent. SO...I followed up, as is my nature. I imagine you DID report this, but what, specifically do YOU want ME to do. You see, I have a particular set of skills, and I am NOT sure how we connected, but I  know that if you have been connected with me, it's  something I HAVE to look into. K? Fatty.

              Only if you want to get trolled. Imgur is owned by Reddit and is very frowned upon by the goat flock.

            Q or no Q, the Saudi situation is weird. A Saudi friend of mine, who's on the liberal side of things, said that basically KSA flipped from being a horizontal monarchy to vertical monarchy over night. He also said that all of KSA's many plays, like yemen and syria, that haven't paid out has taken a toll, more than their gov is letting on, and that there's a lot of talk about a hot war with Iran filtering down to what they consider to be the middle class.    Also, since you're getting flack for Blackwater being disbanded, maybe post the firm's new name, Academi.

             Is there flack? It must be from all the shill accounts I have blocked so the comments don't filter back to me. I don't know why they all go crazy when I post about this situation. It's like they're under rocks sleeping and KERPOW!!! Then they're here doing their best to give their version of pushback.
            </p>
            <p>
             The fact is that this situation is crazy weird. I'm so happy that you provided validation through an anecdotal report. I feel reporting on it and being wrong is less egregious than say nothing about it because we don't know precisely what's happening. And you're mentioning Q. I don't follow him/her so don't follow what's said. Perhaps that's why people are going covfefe over this. In any event, thanks for the info and I will post on this again. Hopefully, there'll be more info.

              To you fucktard a "shill" is anyone who has ever questioned, disagreed, or doubted your self absorbed all knowing bulllshit! Before you throw around "shill", why don't you let everyone know exactly how many people you have blocked. I guarantee Its more posters than anyone on voat because you can't handle a challenge!

            If this were real, all that Americans would have to is cross a line that Muslims wouldn't. Perhaps something homosexual, and make video of it. I imagine that a Muslim torturer might not go there, and a victim in a high position would likely capitulate.

            In July 2004, Blackwater was hired by the U.S. State Department under the Bureau of Diplomatic Security's Worldwide Personal Protective Services (WPPS) umbrella contract, along with DynCorp International and Triple Canopy, Inc. for protective services in Iraq, Afghanistan, Bosnia, and Israel.[25] The contract applied for two years and expired on June 6, 2006. It authorized 482 personnel, and Blackwater received $488m for its work.

           <p>
            In May 2006, the U.S. State Department awarded WPPS II, the successor to its previous diplomatic security contract.[26] Under this contract, the State Department awarded Blackwater, along with Triple Canopy and DynCorp, a contract for diplomatic security in Iraq.

            After the September 11 attacks, Cofer Black, the former head of counter terrorism at the CIA, requested that the federal government hire more contractors to operate overseas. Eventually, the CIA realized that a large number of civilian contractors would be needed overseas to accomplish its broad goals. The federal government turned to Blackwater for assistance

             My old man said that DynCorp had some pretty heavy allegations against them back in the day. I dont remember and I dont want to speculate, but do you know of any off hand? They may tie in to all this.

              The pizzagate put DynCorp squarely in the middle of the child trafficking business in dozens of ways. I don't even remember all the ties that were found but the ties were numerous. DynCorp also got busted for trafficking but all they got was a slap on the wrist.

             And they're mercenaries! Naturally, they're dirty, dirty, dirty!!!! Who the hell would think that people you hire to torture enemies aren't nice people? So I'm sure they're horrible. No convincing needed.

              there was another name change
             </p>
             <p>
              2010–2014: Academi[edit]
In 2010, a group of private investors purchased Xe's North Carolina training facility and built Academi, a new company, around it. Academi's Board of Directors included former Attorney General John Ashcroft, former White House Counsel and Vice Presidential Chief of Staff Jack Quinn, retired Admiral and former NSA Director Bobby Ray Inman,[48] and Texas businessman Red McCombs, who served as Chairman of the Board.[49] Quinn and Ashcroft were independent directors, without other affiliations to Academi.[50]
             </p>
             <p>
              In May 2011, Academi named Ted Wright as CEO.[51] Wright hired Suzanne Rich Folsom as Academi's chief regulatory and compliance officer and deputy general counsel.[52] The Academi Regulatory and Compliance team won National Law Journal's 2012 Corporate Compliance Office of the Year Award.[53]
             </p>
             <p>
              In 2012, retired Brigadier General Craig Nixon was named the new CEO of Academi.[54]
             </p>
             <p>
              2014–present: Constellis Holdings[edit]
             </p>
             <p>
              A merger between Triple Canopy and Academi, along with other companies that were part of the Constellis Group package, are now all gathered under the Constellis Holdings, Inc. umbrella.[10] The transaction brings together an array of security companies including Triple Canopy, Constellis Ltd., Strategic Social, Tidewater Global Services, National Strategic Protective Services, ACADEMI Training Center and International Development Solutions.[11]

                   Probably true. But something must be going on. When this started happening, the Lebanese Prime Minister was thought to be being held hostage in Saudi Arabia. He was going to resign, but after returning to Lebanon, oh, guess what? He changed his mind. Was it MBS that changed it for him?
                  </p>

                    Lebanese Prime Minister Saad Hariri announced Wednesday he was putting his resignation on hold, more than two weeks after he shocked the country by saying he was stepping down.
Speaking hours after he returned to Beirut, Hariri said he had accepted President Michel Aoun's wish for him to suspend his resignation to allow for more consultations on the reasons behind the move.
Hariri announced he was standing down on November 4 while in the Saudi capital, Riyadh, saying he feared his life was in danger. Lebanon said it could not accept his resignation until he returned to the country.
Aoun said at the time Hariri was being held against his will in Riyadh -- a claim Hariri denied -- and speculation swirled in Lebanon that he was being held hostage.

               I despise windows update. I learned how to trick it into not updating and it is super easy. All you have to do is set your internet connection to a "metered connection." That is the setting people would normally use if they were on a data plan and didn't want anything hogging up their data plan and costing money. It will not throttle your data or your speed at all. Windows just thinks you are on a paid data plan connection and won't update while it is set that way.

             naaa bra, according to Q this is the end of the NWO, which means NATO, and the global banking system. Its happening. /sarc Somebody is pushing this agenda and it came with shills that are aggressive as hell if you try to point out that its business as usual outside the Q bubble.

               We used to fight against pedophilia. Now they have us fighing the entire world NWO system. I could not have devised a more clever psyop myself to distract people from pedophilia. At least with pedophilia we had a specific goal and were creating awareness. Now our message is lost in a blizzard of global politics and "Al Franken pretended to touch a woman's boobs."

            This concerns me on a couple of levels.  First Is the well known tactic of our lovely overlords of introducing barbaric behaviors against those they have demonized, i.e.
            <em>
             those dirty vicious Arabs
            </em>
            ,  and then when it suits them flip it as a normalized behavior to be used against
            <strong>
             the American public
            </strong>
            .  If people remember the DHS listings of characteristics to look for and be suspicious of in a terrorist were things like:
            <strong>
             people who talk about the Constitution, or people who have Ron Paul bumper stickers, etc
            </strong>
            .   The other odd misfit element is wondering what middle eastern country could possibly need to import interrogators to torture their prisoners?  They have been at that for millennia.  Nobody needs to teach them about the procedure.  Call me a conspiracy theorist, but this whole thing doesn't smell right to me.

             Agreed. And while it is tempting to descend into violent fantasies of torturing child molestors in the name of justice, I don't think it is ultimately good for our own humanity. I'm guilty of it myself. Especially after I've just read some harrowing account of what happened to a victim or something. But I definitely don't support institutionalized torture beyond what is necessary to make someone divulge info needed to save lives. And don't we have softer methods for that, like drugs? Anyway...it is odd. And I didn't know that about the DHS! That's CRAZY!

              One i remember was the 2009 MIAC report:
              <a href="http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2009/03/23/fusion-centers-expand-criteria-identify-militia-members.html">
               http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2009/03/23/fusion-centers-expand-criteria-identify-militia-members.html
              </a>
              There were actually others leaked to the alt media that were even more absurd than that.
And my imagination gets really worked up thinking about what would be a
              <strong>
               just
              </strong>
              punishment for child molesters too.  But that needs to be tempered with the reality of how dangerous it would be allowing that kind of power to be given to govt.  They are already allotting themselves constitutional powers that don't exist based on reasons that are total fiction.

            Prince Alwaleed Talal, the arrested prince, is most certainly a bad dude just like soon to be new king Crown Prince Salman is. They are all depraved.
           </p>
           <p>
            Alwaleed Talal, the guy that got arrested seems to have ties to Clinton or that is the word. If so i'm glad they arrested him.
           </p>
           <p>
            Seemingly the Twitter crackdown on free speech is not his doings though because he has just been neutered. I guess he could still have enough pull for this to be some type of revenge but I doubt he is anything but scared as hell and hoping to keep some of his money at this point.

             The notion that Americans aren't behind torture world wide is funnier. The notion that Americans didn't arm and train terrorist is hillarious. The notion that Trump is a white hat is hysterical. How is the pizzagate investigation going? I heard the CIA was arrested. I heard the marines were securing our freedoms in the name of loyalty to Trump. You hear a lot of stupid bullshit. You aren't supposed to beleive it.

              Eric Prince, founder of Blackwater, is Betsy Devos' brother. Devos is a secretary of Education. Eric Prince was the guy who gave a radio interview detailing NYPD findings on Weiner's laptop - and why Comey was forced to reopen Hillary case - costing her the election. Did Trump hire Devos because of it?  A 3D chess move? 
Remember Trump's tweet Oct8, 2012. Donald will not get child rapists &amp; murderers get away. 
The Podesta Group is dissolving, 6000+ Pedophile arrests so far. Let's have some faith in POTUS - and I am as cynical as they come.

              They are academi now, under constellus group, along side several others. Seems they consolidated, probably have/had legal protections for a bunch of stuff. I'm still unsure about the loyalties of the mercs themselves and the leadership that may be along.

              Why would you post this in a sub about pedophilia anyway? Because Q said our government is taking down an entire global banking system, NATO, and an entire occult structure?
             </p>
             <p>
              The heir to the throne just got shoved aside by an aggressive young Prince who cut a deal with the Trump administration to finish off Yemen and Iran and that is what this is all about. Who just did a huge weapons deal with the Saudis not too long ago? Trump did, that is who. Wonder what that was all about?
             </p>
             <p>
              You don't think Trump sold billions of dollars to the Saudis to they can continue to kill children in Yemen and next Iran do you? This whole Q miasma of horseshit is a distraction to the subject of pedophilia and i'm not so sure it was an accident.

              Im not sayin bin Talal is innocent,  at least he had a legit claim being grandson of King Saud, Salman is a joke with no claim &amp; an obvious plant .The reason mercs were called in is because the old regime isnt going down easy, a kings son has never ascended an alot of rich Sheiks want to slice his throat.

                I cannot prove it with undying proof but when you readwhat happened to Heather O,Rourke. It is hard to say he is not. Then there was an animated character that looked like Spielberg raping a disabled child. I strongly believe he is a pedophile. If you look up Heather you may come to the same conclusion.

             Doubt what is happening? The purge and the torture? Or how I'm interpreting it?
            </p>
            <p>
             I wanted the news disseminated. No matter what the reason, this story is huge. This is a complete shake-up. So take it for what it is. MBS is clear he wants Saudi Arabia to be moderate. By the process of elimination, were these elites against that goal? Or were they working counter to it by participating in activities that could no longer be deemed "moderate"?
            </p>
            <p>
             Like I said, take it for what it is and put your own spin on it if you don't agree with mine.

              I have read this account from several different sources. I don't doubt that this story is being pushed as true. It certainly sounds very real, if we were in a movie. That isn't your spin on it, that is the way it's being reported. 
It seems as if someone who watches a lot of movies made this up. During the Obama administration there were lots of stories that always seemed to be more movie based than reality based. 
If you were to google "Obama administration" and "west wing television show" you would see that a lot of things that he did and how he spoke about things were directly lifted from the television show West wing.
I think that when the powers that be want to send out a message, they use words and images that they think people will understand. I think the powers that be watch a lot of movies

               I see where it could be viewed that way, but art sometimes imitates life soooo ... not sure with this one. It seems more real than a false narrative, but I've been fooled before.

              Why should we believe anything he says? His whole family are a tribe of degenerate women beaters who became completely depraved by access to more money than they can spend.

             <p>
              And zerohedge is reporting that they are negotiating to let the arrested Princes go if they give up 70% of their wealth which is hundreds of billions of dollars. That sounds like a power play.
             </p>
             <p>
              The King's seat is up for grabs because the old King is too old to hang on to it. The young Prince's are jockeying for power positions.

             <p>
              Makes more sense to me to believe this is a power struggle than to believe "the good Saudis' suddenly shook off their conditioning and upbringing as degenerates with privilege who treat women like disposable play toys and like complete shit.

               Yeah I heard the illuminatie shut down to. In reality they were rebranded Council on Foreign Relations. You guys have an agenda and can't beleive this because it proves what a scumbag Trump is. Yet his tweet that you ignore has him aproving of the torture and saying they deserve it.

             I seem to gather enemies by always considering both sides of a potential psyop too but you are correct because this may not be HUGE at all. It may be psyop.
            </p>
            <p>
             In my opinon there may be an effort to blame the "bad Saudis" for the Saudi role in 911 and let U.S., British intelligence, and Mossad skate to freedom. Oh, and the "good Saudis" get to go free too.
            </p>
            <hr/>
            <p>
             The Prince's that are left are not "the good Princes" either.
            </p>
            <hr/>
            <p>
             This could also just be a psyop and a fake news story to make the world believe that the "bad Saudis" have been caught. There may not be any beatings at all happening. Would not surprise me.

              Can you take criticism or will you be ignorant? A lot of people do not appreciate their feed being in caps lock with clickbait titles. Since Voat has a smarter community, we upvoat quality and non-clickbait more often. Please don't just call someone out for being a shill when it's criticism that can help you spread pizzagate.

            This must be something big regarding American security and trying to extract info beforehand. I can't imagine any other reason that Americans would be involved. Interesting.

             Yes, I was thinking the same thing. Otherwise, why American mecenaries? It wouldn't make any sense. Especially if it only had to do with Saudi Arabia. I mean, what would happen if one of the elite talked while a mercenary was torturing him and the mercenary learned Saudi Arabia intel? Wouldn't they have to get rid of the mercenary also? No, the only way it makes sense is if what he was extracting also had to do with American concerns.
