<ul>
<li>John H. Kenoyer, one of 11 children, was born in West Point, Iowa on April 2, 1922</li>
<li>He graduated from Erskine Academy and began college at the University of Maine, Orono</li>
<li>He became an instructor pilot for the <strong>Army Air Force</strong>, flying B-29s during World War II</li>
<li>After the war he returned to the college and graduated with a B. S. degree in Business Administration</li>
<li>Kenoyer spent 31 years in the FBI serving in Washington, D.C., Watertown, N.Y. and last as <strong>the FBI\'s Augusta bureau chief</strong></li>
<li>March 1986: A decade after his retirement, Kenoyer was indicted, suspected on pedophilia</li>
<li>June 1986: Kenoyer pleaded guilty in June to <strong>nine charges</strong>, including unlawful sexual contact, assault and gross sexual misconduct.</li>
<li>Until February 1987: Kenoyer jumped bail and disappeared. He lived as a fugitive in Lake Villa Apartments in Coeur D\'Alene, Idaho</li>
<li>February 1987: Kenoyer was arrested</li>
<li>September 1987: Kennebec County Superior Court Judge <strong>Donald G. Alexander</strong> imposed a sentence: </li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>nine months in prison and two more years of house arrest for sexually assaulting a 12-year-old neighbor girl</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>December 1987: Kenoyer filed a hand written motion to serve his house-arrest time in the Lake Villa Apartments:</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>He said he hopes to spend those years at the Lake Villa Apartments in Coeur D\'Alene, Idaho, where he lived as a fugitive prior to his arrest last February. The apartment complex has a swimming pool, jacuzzi and tennis court.</p>
<p>District Attorney <strong>David Crook</strong> said he did not plan to object to Kenoyer\'s request.</p>
<p>\'I think it is a reasonable request, provided all the other conditions of probation are met,\' Crook said. \'I think it is pretty routine.\'</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li><em>[editor\'s note: I didn\'t find a source for if the motion was passed or not. My guess is it was]</em></li>
<li><em>[Time from January 1988 (after serving in jail) to April 2010 is unknown to me]</em></li>
<li>John Kenoyer, of Yarmouth, passed away on Sunday, April 11, 2010, at the age of 88</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>He is survived by his four children, Janet Kenoyer of Ashburn, Va., Galen Kenoyer of Claremont, Calif., Marilyn Kenoyer of Poughkeepsie, N.Y., and Chris Kenoyer of Alna; seven grandchildren; three great-grandchildren; two sisters, Helen Mosher of South China, and Ruth Polley of Sebattus, one brother, Joe Kenoyer of Clemson, S.C.; a cousin raised in the family, Charles Sisson of Nederland, Texas; and numerous cousins; nieces and nephews.</p>

<p>is that this pedophile was not charged correctly (who\'s <strong>David Crook</strong>?) and got a too short sentence (9 months in jail for pedophilia, really?). The judge <strong>Donald G.

            I'm surprised he served any time at all.

            Although looking at the charge sheet - pleading guilty to nine charges of under-age sexual crimes, absconding whilst on bail, remaining in hiding until his arrest - it seems they would have been hard pushed not to sentence him to a little bit of time in prison.

            These sick fuckers circle the wagons every fucking time.  You see it in cases of corruption; one patsy or two will get jail time and the rest will get a slap on the wrist if anything - usually it's a promotion in the offing.  So you sure as hell are going to see it in cases of paedophilia.  The 'community', as John Podesta put it recently, is just one sick bunch of psychopathically inclined subhumans who inversely believe they are all some kind of supreme, untouchable demi-god.

            They need to be stopped - completely.  From the Crown to the very last little digit at the foot.

            Ronald Bernhard recent video makes clear that all 'secret-service' including FBI in USA only exists to protect Israel, and their Pedophile Mafia.
           </p>
           <p>
            It's clear that our FBI agent somehow had to be "Made an Example" he obviously crossed a line, or most likely thought he was a god like all the pedophile elite.

             Thanks but please come up with sourced claims or some other helpful stuff forwarding the investigation started by my post. You share a strong claim there without a source, hence my down vote.

             They almost always pick family's that have 2+ kids, they kill one, and then say "If you dont' want your other children to die, then shut the fuck up", just saying how they operate.
            </p>
            <p>
             Amazing how people will shut-up, to save anymore of their children from death.
            </p>
            <p>
             Furthermore since we're talking about the highest levels of GOV, these ppl can do anything to the entire family tree, this is why even though TRUMP has had 100's of family's come forward and file complaints about their daughters being raped, nobody has gotten TRUMP in jail, its because these people are MAFIA, and they really do have the power ti 'disappear' an entire family tree.
