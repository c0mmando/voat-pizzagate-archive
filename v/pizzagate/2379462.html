            That article itself is a hit job on this guy. Probably means he was a good guy who tried to help and knew the Podestas were responsible for the crime.

             Halligen's Oakley International, formed after Madeleine was reported missing, brought in Det Supt Andy Tattersall to help in the McCann Team's investigation.
            </p>
            <p>
             And where did Andy Tattersall make his name?

             On the Jill Dando investigation, working alongside DCS Hamish Campbell!

           </blockquote>
           <p>
            And it's interesting now to look back at the things which Tattersall, who hails from the Manchester area, said about the conviction of Barry Bulsara - when the case had been referred to the Court of Appeal. Here are some extracts from an article in the Manchester Evening News.

            <p>
             It may be of interest that Halligen was initially represented in the extradition proceedings by
             <strong>
              Mark Summers of the barristers’ chamber Matrix - where he was a colleague of Cherie Blair, wife of former Prime Minister Tony Blair, and Founder of Matrix Chambers
             </strong>
             . Summers was the lawyer of choice for politically sensitive cases and complex cross-border and jurisdictional issues.
            </p>
            <p>
             <strong>
              His trials also include cases of human trafficking and child abduction. Several of the people Summers has represented have died in mysterious circumstances.
             </strong>

               The Libyan Investment Authority (LIA) argues that Goldman and its bankers attempted to exert influence over its investment decisions by paying hotel bills and offering corporate hospitality.

               The LIA has also made claims that a Goldman banker, Youseff Kabbaj, procured prostitutes as part of his efforts to win access to the fund. Goldman’s QC did not address these allegations. Kabbaj, the court has been told, has agreed a $4.5m settlement with Goldman and will not give evidence.

               Roger Masefield QC, representing the LIA, told the court she was not being called because of “media intrusion”.

           <blockquote>
            <p>
             Extraordinarily, Oakley International Group, sometime between February and April 2008, were awarded a 6-month contract worth £½ million plus expenses, ostensibly to try to find out what happened to Madeleine McCann.
            </p>
            <p>
             <strong>
              It was about this time – March 2008 – that the government-funded Forensic Science Service, based in Birmingham, were preparing their final report on the forensics for the McCann investigation.
             </strong>
            </p>
            <p>
             <strong>
              It is of no little interest, therefore, that in the same month (March 2008) Halligen’s partners at Oakley International, Andre Hollis and the Van Scoyoc company, were actually lobbying the US Senate on behalf of the Forensic Science Services in the UK.
             </strong>
            </p>
            <p>
             Not only that, but one of the Senators they met with was Richard C Shelby, the very Senator that Gerry McCann met in Washington some 9 months before. The Shelby election campaign was robustly supported by QinetiQ North America and by law firm Patton Boggs.
            </p>
            <p>
             <strong>
              As a return on this support, Shelby awarded QinetiQ North America a contract worth $8,000,000 [£½ million] to provide work on behalf of the US Army Aviation and Missile, Research, Development and Engineering Center.
             </strong>
            </p>
            <p>
             And then in April 2008, Halligen's partner, Andre Hollis (also the Chief Executive Officer of Oakley International Group LLC), lobbied the House of Representatives and the US Senate on behalf of Oakley Strategic Services LLC, in a bid to win contracts with the US Department of Defense. The company spent $20,000 and then £5,000 during the period March - April 2008 on issues relating to strategic training and consulting services.

             A NEW LOOK AT KEVIN HALLIGEN AND ALL HIS HIGH LEVEL CONNECTIONS

           <blockquote>
            <p>
             My source seems to know a great deal about Halligen’s employment history, or perhaps I should say his history of Directorships and setting up ‘front’ companies. Here is the list he gives:
            </p>
            <p>
             "The chronology and the choice of events from Halligen's employment history [in the Evening Standard article] served to support the story of a 'con-man' and a 'fantasist'. It made his actions appear impetuous, almost random, the actions of a man surviving on his wits and scuttling from one scam to another, acting impulsively, acting alone…[but] The real chronology (above) challenges that belief. Looking over documents filed at Companies House, a different character emerges and a different chain of command emerges too. There are greater forces involved, more interested parties…
             <strong>
              Halligen has spent much of his prior career in the fields of private security and defence, precariously enmeshed in lucrative projects for the Ministry of Defence and the US Department of Defense
             </strong>

           <blockquote>
            <p>
             In the summer of 2002. Halligen and Major-General John Holmes (ex Director of Special Forces) were recruited by Gerald Moore and Sir John Walker of Inkerman Group specifically for the Minerva Programme (anti-terrorist, emergency response project performed in association with QinetiQ, the UK Government Defence Agency). They both appear on the July annual returns form as Directors. Holmes seems to have resigned abruptly in January 2003, after little more than 6 months at Inkerman, to work on ‘Project Unicorn’ for the Metropolitan Police with Nicola Heath and Paul Cardew. Halligen resigned form Inkerman on 31 August 2003.

             <p>
              Zurich,Dec 11 --- Dubail Sultan Ahmed bin Sulayem, CEO of Dubai Ports world also known as Sheikh Maktoum Right hand, 62, was detained in Switzerland on Thursday over an alleged attempt at serious financial fraud. He was released by the Swiss police today.
             </p>
             <p>
              Jana Muelli spokesman for the Swiss Police, declared that the UAE Authorities and the Dubai police have been asked to cooperate in the Investigation into an attempted fraud in which allegedly UAE citizens participated. She did not have any more information.
             </p>
             <p>
              Dubai Ports World spokesman refused to confirm onto whether bin Sulayem holds diplomatic immunity and whether it applies in case of illegal activities.
             </p>
             <p>
              In this concrete case, as an obvious crime seems involved, it is hard to imagine it being covered by any immunity said Jana Muelli spokeswoman for the Swiss police, but added this is a matter for the Swiss attorney to decide.
Media have written about bin Sulayem indiction in numerous corruption matters also in connection with bribes of millions of US $ arising from his role as Sheikh Maktoum’s Dubai Ports World company.
             </p>
             <p>
              He still faces numerous claims in various jurisdictions since the withdrawal of DP World from the London stock exchange allegedly because of a high risk claim for bribery in 2013.
             </p>
             <p>
              In 2014, Bin Sulayem had a serious incident in a hotel with an African television reporter whom he attacked both verbally and physically after she asked him about an allegedly unfair behavior of Dubai ports world and potential corrupt practices.
According to media, Bin Sulayem is a witness and an aggrieved party in an extensible case of corruption, embezzlement and forgery, currently running before the London High Court. The case potentially incurs millions of US $ damages.
In the past, Bin Sulayem, had problems with law mainly because of Drug and alcohol related matters and traffic accidents. In June 2007, his car knocked-down a woman on a pedestrian crossing and he was found driving under high alcohol. He financially settled the accident with the young Morrocan woman and had her expelled from Dubai.
             </p>
             <p>
              In 2014, in a hotel in Hong-Kong, he hit a young woman who suffered injuries and was taken to hospital. The matter was first investigated as a possible crime, but based on an expert’s opinion it was qualified as a misdemeanor against the young massage person and again financially settled.
