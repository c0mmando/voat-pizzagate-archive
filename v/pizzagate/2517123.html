            Wrong sub.  But Fuck Kanye he's a racist asshole.  Didn't his mom die because he insisted a white doctor would not preform her routine plastic surgery?  That being said If he can get the dindus to think logically about their future and current welfare trap they're in then by all means tweet on asshole.

           <p>
            I don't see how this is directly relevant to our investigation of #pg as per Rule 1 (Submmission Rules can be found in the sidebar.)  This will be flaired for removal in 24 hours unless you can find a way to connect this to #pg.
           </p>
           <p>
            Perhaps you could start by posting a link to his 'ping pong' tweet and explaining its significance.
           </p>
           <p>
            Thanks.
