They say, you fish where the fish are. And if you are into children, what better place to fish than to own an adoption center or a foster care agency. You get to pick and choose the best candidates and sell it off to the highest bidder.</p>
<p>Researching FBIAnon, saying don’t focus on the pizza places, there are much bigger areas to focus on , and seeing the pedo swirl logo pop up in different places I began to expand my horizons. If I were a Pedo, where would I go? After researching and finding some clues, adoption centers not keeping records, going unchecked, I found the target…</p>
<p>I also came to the conclusion that the 2007 FBI report was of logos from that day. 9 years is a lot of time. Being a graphics designer, I know logos have improved tremendously over this period of time. We have to assume that since the 2007 FBI report on PEDO logos that some of the top brass would have caught win and relayed it to the more high profile targets. Adoption Centers and Foster Cares would be that type of target, not a shitty protected pizza place a half block from the white house. So Its understandable why Besta still had it in their logo.</p>
<p>Thru google image searching and using wayback I found a few logos that have been updated. This was the most obvious to me. Family Services of NW PA logo here <a href="http://www.logotypes101.com/logos/244/41CE55BCB614B2EBD39D0A862A8B47D2/FamilyServicesofNWPA.png">http://www.logotypes101.com/logos/244/41CE55BCB614B2EBD39D0A862A8B47D2/FamilyServicesofNWPA.png</a> clearly shows the Young Boy Lover Swirl Logo in the background. The new logo has 3 circles on a tree. <a href="http://www.fsnwpa.org/">http://www.fsnwpa.org/</a> Using this as a Rosetta Stone, I included in my search any logo that had 3 circles, and there were A LOT!</p>
<p>Here was Methodology</p>
<p>I went to <a href="https://childwelfare.gov/nfcad">https://childwelfare.gov/nfcad</a> to find the list of every adoption center and foster care in each state, I checked the proper boxes, and did a search.</p>
<p>For each state I opened up the website, I looked at the logo and compared it to the FBI chart from 2007. I was looking for anything that had a logo that used 2 hearts, the Young Boy Lover Swirl Logo, any Butterfly Logo and I also added in 3 circles, and few tree logos that had hearts.</p>
<p>If I found an exact match I put it down.</p>
<p>If I found it being close I went to the wayback machine and compared how the logo evolved. If it was consistent or didn’t show up (happened a lot) I put it down, if it was a non-incriminating logo in the wayback I did not post it.</p>
<p>If I saw a hint of it being on the radar I did a wayback, mostly I did not put it down, but a couple times I did see an obvious pedo logo that they changed in the past, so I put it on the list.</p>
<p>Only 10% of the logos I saw made it on this list.</p>
<p>ME: I’m a graphic designer, web developer, researcher, and truther. I have helped many clients start companies with branding, websites and content development.

            Exactly! If we're not careful about throwing accusations around, the lives of good people might be ruined. And worse still, if this movement continues to be discredited, it might fail to achieve any positive outcomes

            What I noticed is that a lot of them use the four colors  and a lot use a sun logo which seem to match the theme.
I think it is more complicated than what you are trying here!
           </p>
           <p>
            I think there is a meaning behind their logo's and the meaning will unlock them.
           </p>
           <p>
            Example being that one pizza place that just got busted for pedo. He did not have these logo's but the ZZ in pizza had immediately match in my mind to the DC pizza triangle logo with particular attention to the dots in the Z's. I'm not sure what it is..
           </p>
           <p>
            Another thing I noticed around the same time, from another pizza place where the word "pizza" was mirrored backwards, spelling "ASS19". Then there is the "PIE" org that was disbandment in the 80's after being founded in 1974 so that bring PIE into the thought process.. Pizza seemed to come about around the turn of the century "pizza pie" eip ass19?? Maybe PIE just triggered an idea for them and they came up with pizza ass19.. also another person found they seem to have an obsession with ancient Greek cult revolving around pedophilia.
           </p>
           <p>
            The triangle might be a delta the progression of the inward spiral may mean something but may just be the way they made it unique to their group. And the dotted pattern and color pallet and its arrangement..
           </p>
           <p>
            The pedo cult of ancient Greece started around the time of Jewish over throw. The followers of the Talmud which is almost identical to the Quran. Also note on Comet Pizza sign the crescent moon and star. Of Islam.. Both the Talmud and Islam not only condone pedophilia but promote it.
Unlock these codes based on these tid bits of research. I think we found a cult living among us wearing the face of Judaism but the polar opposite, Satanism, a cult over or around 2000 years old if not as old as Judaism and also getting Jews in trouble as in always accused of manipulation. Thats been happening all through history.. Kinda like your evil twin doing evil and blaming you.
           </p>
           <p>
            All these things need to be considered in order to logically decipher these things. Like as I mentioned the sun logo, look at BC Canada, a major pedo hub. The Ministry of Children and Families has no logo but the BC half sun or setting sun logo. This org is known for feminist gang stalking of happy healthy families and taking kids away from good parents, after destroying the family, giving them to unruly people. Then look at logos associated with them shows a sun logo in many more situations as well as the four colors implemented in many graphs and charts.
Here is another example of the half sun, this looks like a crescent moon kinda and it has a cross laying down and a four color block set

            And a flow chart of sorts using four colors

            A sun like logo with four'ish colors
            <a href="https://media-cache-ec0.pinimg.com/736x/01/3a/28/013a282f98ad6fe0b68b0bc6f2b4f39e.jpg">

            </a>
            Another odd logo
            <a href="http://pvbclincoln.org/monkimage.php?mediaDirectory=mediafiles&amp;mediaId=2430873&amp;fileName=childrens-ministry-960-0-0-0.png">

            </a>
            This is all from one Canadian province that is known for connections to Clinton's and many sex predators and had at one time bridged links and leads to many international perps.
            <br/>
            Something to think about as you do your logo research.

            this. As a designer with 20 years experience in logo design, I can promise you that people copy generic shapes - swirls, circles, stars, generic people etc. It's just the most basic DIY design. It's everywhere. If we are going to start saying that every swirl in a logo means they are pedos, that's just plain fucking retarded and it's holding us back in a big way.

             you guys need to know the difference between accusation and interrogation. We know that those kind places are OFTEN manipulated by pedo or pro-pedo people. When I mean those kind of places, I mean, child services, child summer camp, child sports team, child school, etc.

             I agree that the presence of this logo do not make them guilty of anything, but it is worth a damn good checkup before saying so. Look at the liliput's one he posted .. freaking me out. Maybe it is nothing. But we are talking about kids integrity and security. So maybe it is something, and we can't  wait too long because it is an ongoing business...
