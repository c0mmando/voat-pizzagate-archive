<p>Translation:</p>
<p>Dutch girls of 10 years work in prostitution \'</p>
<p>Girls sometimes end up in prostitution at a very young age. \'Recently, a 10-year-old girl was registered for our shelter,\' said Anke van Dijke of Fier Fryslân, Friday. Her organization receives dozens of girls between the ages of 12 and 23 who were forced to work as a prostitute.</p>
<p>They seek out the limits, make more extreme demands or refuse a condom, precisely because they know that such a prostitute can not go anyway.</p>
<p>In addition to Dutch victims, there are also about 150 foreign people in this shelter. They often ended up in the sex industry after being lured to the Netherlands by human traffickers under false pretenses. Many of them come from Africa and a quarter of them are male.</p>
<p>According to Van Dijke, men end up in homoprostitution or are used in the porn industry. There they are used for the most extreme forms of sex, such as with animals. As a result, the victims are traumatized, while according to her, most of them have a traumatic background. Dutch victims, too, usually have a rotten past and have been placed in a vulnerable situation before being encapsulated by pimps.</p>
<p>Van Dijke sketched the situation of victims and their backgrounds during the presentation of an initiative bill to penalize clients who knowingly make use of prostitutes who have to do their work involuntarily. Van Dijke is happy with the proposal, but as far as she is concerned, that may go a step further. She points out that some customers use a woman or man in an exploitation situation. &quot;They look for boundaries, make more extreme demands or refuse a condom, precisely because they know that such a prostitute can not go anyway.&quot;</p>
<p>The Public Prosecution Service is also happy with the initiative, even though the evidence will become \'a hard one,\' said Justice Officer Jolanda de Boer. In the Netherlands prostitution is permitted under certain conditions, but sex with minors is punishable.</p>',

            Peace be with you OP. I am praying for light to come to you and artificial duality. Let’s keep a reference to thos browbeating strategies you mentioned, I would like to see those explained and diagrammed so we can teach people to disarm and avoid them. Also, how could we set up a fund for victims? A way to support and feed these people, hide them from their enslavers? Maybe it’s time to look into that. Now that we are getting victims, how can we protect them. Let’s pray about that, y’all.

            When I consider this perverted behavior, which is a thought process that requires some effort, I realize that I’m just not prepared for the scale and magnitude of this depravity. When a rural American hears a story about some sicko having sex with a horse ...it’s just one sicko. “Oh well”, they think, “what a crazy world.” One or two pedophiles in the big city? “Yeah, you gotta watch out and protect your kids.” But now, look at this report. An international industry, with 100s of victims. Can you imagine how many RICH and POWERFUL sickos there are out there to support and PROTECT this industry? It’s not just some freaks in their basement making amateur videos. It is a giant industry, enslaving humans and spitting them out like grist at a faster and faster pace. Everyday, the failure of the collective populace to act emboldens them more. Well, the good news is that they apparently can’t hide the victims anymore. The “tunnels” are still hidden, but the satanism and the victims? There are dozens to hundreds right here in this article. Earth civil war/good vs evil time.

            Unfortunate for good Dutch people, but I literally associate Netherlands with drugs and perversion, first and foremost. Surely much else in that country, but that's the public image that dominates. I also have the perception of the Dutch "elite" being infiltrated by jews at a very early point, like in England, and this might explain much of the current debauchery.

             If you've ever looked at the levels of perversion in the Weimar Republic (they became the #1 sex tourism destination during that time), you start to realize that not everything that Hitler railed about was batshit crazy.  He was right about the filth and perversion in Berlin, for example (you could get any kind of sexual desire fulfilled there -- including children).  And also about the degenerate art.

              Hitler was certainly right about this and so much more. Nothing he railed about was crazy in the slightest. The same synagogue of satan preys on humanity as it did back then.

            I used to think that pizzagate was a little over the top.  No way could THAT many pedophiles be operating across the world and getting away with it.
           </p>
           <p>
            Now I think it the case for pizzagate is significantly watered down.

            It's a disaster in my country. The good folk face a near impossible resistance from the malevolency engrained in our public and not-so-public services. Sometimes it saddens me into just giving up the fight. My latest VOAT postings (deleted) caused a whole hell-hole of malevolency to descend on me that got me  balancing on one leg nearly, toppling me over almost.

            The Satanism remains strong throughout, mostly notable through principles as "inversion of guild", "maximum distance principle", "hyperbolism the one or other way", "prop 'n drop doctrine", "coercion doctrine" etc. So many mental doctrinal tricks they've got on their sleeves to turn the unsuspect and even suspect away from the core case, while marginalizing whistleblowers into nothingness through afore mentioned techniques.
           </p>
           <p>
            I'm still standing, I'm still alive. The harrassement has reduced some (EM wave blasting and other forms of mental harassement), but that's because they feel they're victorious over me, having marginalized their own image to something near innocent like bubblegum Satanism.

              , thank you for your concern. Yes, I did take a break sort of, but I also kept on going finding a job. I just can't have them relegate me out of the system and be put away or something. It's going better now though, although financially I'm almost grounded. Things are looking up though. In fact, today I have a final job conversation and likely I can start working again tomorrow in my regular field, programming nice software :).
             </p>
             <p>
              I'm still going strong despite of what has been and is happening to me. There's still technology based harassment going on but I ignore it for the most part. They are the ones committing first degree evil by it. I'm still indisputably trusting the infinite good.. and it is people like you that keep me smiling and going.
             </p>
             <p>
              P.S. I'm sorry I haven't posted in a bit; their 'clamp' on me the past weeks have been pretty severe with all kinds of things going but like said, things are looking up a bit; I've noted there are people in my own local world here in Holland are helping me in ways as well which is uplifting.

              Your well whishes are not going unnoticed by me. I am so thankful to know there are people around this world speaking in support of me. I know the last thread sounded serious and out of this world. But this world wide Satanism is no slouch. I'm not backpeddling on what I have figured out of these last companies I've workd for, having identified one as a Satanist hell-hole save one or two members.
             </p>
             <p>
              It's my indisputable trust in the Infinite Good and all of you of the Human Global Collective that give me the power to stand still. Eventhough it may become a possibility I disappear from the system. And then the bets are off to them - it will be so easy to disappear me then, without a home, case, any forms of possession to prove my truth.
             </p>
             <p>
              I can tell another complex bit which entails to proof of having had a relationship with the American woman in 2001. From the telepathic network I have discovered that after my case was denied, the file itself got immediately destructed. The evilists have tried to erase my past already back then. I still have official, physical documents of this.
             </p>
             <p>
              During the 17th, 18th, 19th of Janusary I made a statement: "Here is the evidence [Of my bast with the American Woman and the Visa procedure]. Let's hope the good guys get it". I put the attache-bag that contains all the historic stuff on my livingroom table. And I left the house.
             </p>
             <p>
              When I left the house, my thoughts were erratic. Am I doing the right thing? Going to my mom in case I'm getting waxed? Should I stay? Well.. I went back home. In my 'hood' I already saw cars drive away from where I was going to. And I went back in.
             </p>
             <p>
              When I got back in.... I noted the attache-bag was gone. Well not gone. It was now put inside the table, a bottom cabinet that was open, as I normally put shoes in there. Whoever took it when I left, put the bag back in a dead hurry, just in the wrong location.
             </p>
             <p>
              So I knew 100% sure they were after the documents that prove the existence of the visa case me and my former eternal love went through.
             </p>
             <p>
              God may kill me on spot if all of this is untrue, but I know in this case he wouldn't play into the hands of Satanists. It's with his help and that of everyone concerned that I'm still alive..

               May you live and succeed.  Your bag with documents and proof may have been opened and pictures snapped.  They may have copies.  You need to make sure that there are other copies.  Possibly give them to someone you can really trust AND also put them in a safety deposit box at a bank.  Just remember how very important you are to the world.  You, like all of us have a special purpose here, otherwise God would not have created us.  Do your very best to keep safe and the proof of your existence.  Please keep in touch by posting often.  Peace &lt;3

                Thank you much for your kind words and love. In that difficult time I stayed with my mom indeed, and saw my brother too. It means a lot to me to stay in touch with the few family members I still have. It may be a good idea to make copies of all those documents and keep them at various places. I haven't thought of doing that. It hasn't been until recent that I got to learn they, some way, are valuable to booth good and evil people. If it was all-out evil, I wouldn't be around but I've noted there
                <em>
                 are
                </em>
                people here in Holland that in one way or another, try to help as well.
               </p>
               <p>
                One thing that contributes is that I am sharing my truth (not everything, but at least the bit in regards to the relationship I had in the past as well as my work and achievement history, along with the harassment I endured since the 2nd half of 2015 at employers. I don't have to lie, all I have to do is to 'report' from memory. I don't have to craft illusions. I have a feeling that pays off as well.
               </p>
               <p>
                I will keep posting here and keep an eye on things, but as you've noted, I'm laying low for a little while I try to get up on my feet and begin pay back debts I've been running in the past couple of weeks. You stay strong to.
               </p>
               <p>
                We all should never forget what it's for; a better world with move love in it.. :)

                 One more thing.  I am corresponding with a SRA Survivor and she has been told to reveal it all.  Tell everything to everyone and keep very little secret.  She was told that is her safety.  She has named all her abusers and I just posted it and she did to yesterday here on Voat.  If you tell it all and everyone knows, you make a much bigger problem for your adversaries.  Just a tip.  If you want to read her post

                 but remember it is filled with sorrow.  I found it hard to read her horrid crimes done to her, but the more I know the better about what these evil devils do to their victims.  Again I wish you and you Love and Peace &lt;3

              I'm praying for you and joining many others here in agreement. Lord anoint and have mercy on those applications. Bring them to the desk of managers looking for righteous help!
Supernatural favor Lord, for this we plead. Mercy. In Jesus' Name Amen...

            Yup, legalization is going to solve everything. Remember that one?
