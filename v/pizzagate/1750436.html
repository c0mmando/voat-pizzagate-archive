<p>No offense to Alex Jones because we know you were threatened but I\'m wondering if anyone would be interested in creating a list of fake claims that were linked to Pizzagate that are provably false so we can sort out what is real and what isn\'t for the skeptics. Deleted thread: <a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1749963">https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1749963</a></p>
<p>Obviously James Alefantis is NOT innocent but Alex\'s point that there are other stories going on is somewhat accurate. I think he was told to say that. Podesta is obviously roaming the streets like the cockroach that won\'t die after a nuclear bomb and I will throw a party the day he gets arrested. Off the top of my head I can\'t think of anything reported on Infowars that was even potentially less than accurate besides potentially #1 below, and that was something that only recently occurred to me after looking through the Instagram photos more closely for about the 20th time. </p>
<p>I\'ve seen more shills lately so this will probably be easy but I can think of a few general pizzagate claims off the top of my head that were debunked. What I can\'t debunk is the majority of the evidence related to James Alefantis. (#cumpanda, #pandacumhole, Pandahead magazine, and his films come immediately to mind, as well as the existence of his basement in that culinary article, just as a couple of examples of non-debunkable evidence).</p>
<p>Plausibly potentially false claims:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>On the photo with the #hotard hashtag, I believe it\'s arguable that James and his friends were calling James the hotard. If you look through the photostream it appears on another picture and if you read the other convos closely it sounds like they are talking to each other. <a href="http://archive.li/yMniY">http://archive.li/yMniY</a>  Here is his entire Instagram: <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/146343979@N02/32024107500/">https://www.flickr.com/photos/146343979@N02/32024107500/</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p> The Random Rants of Ryan video claiming that Caris James has semen on her face (obviously eye ointment) or a blister from a branding. (Can’t find this one anymore but it was viral a couple of weeks ago – please let me know if you have a link). </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Potentially untrue: Child porn found on Comet Ping Pong website - this one is potentially untrue because it is tough to verify, nobody is likely or able to click on the child porn to verify it so we are limited to trusting the person who allegedly delivered it to the DC police (please correct me if you have proof). <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnW7OT6Dkuw">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnW7OT6Dkuw</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Majestic Ape is really James Alefantis - this one is irrelevant anyway, but potentially false since Amanda Kleinman obviously plays Majestic Ape at least part of the time.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&quot;The false story that Hillary Clinton runs a child sex ring being run out of Comet Ping Pong&quot; - This line was repeated in the media and by Podesta over and over (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jH2tl5f85A8">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jH2tl5f85A8)</a>) - I\'ve never seen anyone here claim that the world\'s sex slavery operation is run mostly OUT OF Comet Ping Pong - only that Alefantis is obviously a person of interest and Comet Ping Pong had satanic art on the walls and creepy satanic pedophile bands, etc.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Shocking claims that are not easily verifiable: James Alefantis has a secret basement and holds children there - this one was supposedly debunked several times by people claiming there is no basement and they didn\'t see any kids being paraded around Comet Ping Pong and nobody was fucking kids inside the restaurant. People how seriously stupid can you be. If they are transporting children and using a basement for something nefarious, they wouldn\'t be making it that easy for you to catch them just by walking into the store and looking around. However, he does have a basement, and he stores at minimum, jars of sauce there. He could be doing anything there, and we aren\'t going to be able to confirm that by believing or disbelieving people on the internet. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4M2zbeuP7s">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4M2zbeuP7s</a> Tomato article: <a href="http://www.philly.com/philly/food/restaurants/20130822_San_Marzanos_vs__juicy_local_heirlooms.html">http://www.philly.com/philly/food/restaurants/20130822_San_Marzanos_vs__juicy_local_heirlooms.html</a>    Restaurant interview <a href="http://archive.is/2O5n7#selection-1587.586-1587.612">http://archive.is/2O5n7#selection-1587.586-1587.612</a></p>

            I noticed today that Alex Jones claimed in his show yesterday that Laura Silsby worked for the Clinton Foundation. Oh really? I thought she worked for "New Life Children's Refuge" at that time, and now she works for AlertSense. When did she work for the Clinton Foundation? Does Alex Jones have info on this or is he lying intentionally because he doesn't want people to remember the factoid about AlertSense? Maggie Howell I heard went to Right Side Media, and I'm pretty sure she was the one who talked about Silsby on air originally and brought up Amber Alerts, although it might have been Leanne Macadoo. In his retraction Jones said that two of his  reporters are no longer with him. Anyone know for sure which one it was? I am not sure and I think he removed all his pizzagate coverage.
           </p>
           <p>
            One other thought: Alex laid out his "what the real news is" points in his show yesterday and I'm like, duh, ok that is all stuff everyone knows and nobody calls fake. So what the hell Alex?

              What was there to even retract? You can't really make a retraction if you are not saying what you are retracting, and all he says is he thinks JA is innocent but he didn't say anything else.

            Alex Jones is partially correct that there is false information inserted to distract us, but that false information was used to distract us from the core of pizzagate itself.
           </p>
           <p>
            The core of pizzagate -- that is, the initial discoveries that started the investigation -- are the following facts:
           </p>
           <p>
            James Alefantis or his friends on Instagram depict pizza in sexual contexts.
           </p>
           <p>
            James Alefantis is friends with Podesta.
           </p>
           <p>
            James Alefantis uploaded several photos on his Instagram which can be interpreted as references to child abuse or pedophilia.
           </p>
           <p>
            Tony Podesta collects imagery which can be interpreted as references to child abuse and pedophilia.
           </p>
           <p>
            Tony Podesta is friends with convicted pedophile Hastert who abused and molested children.
           </p>
           <p>
            John Podesta works for Hillary Clinton.
           </p>
           <p>
            Hillary Clinton and her Husband flew on Lolita Express with Epstein, a convicted pedophile.
           </p>
           <p>
            The Clintons took an interest in releasing Laura Silsby from jail after being arrested for kidnapping children.
           </p>
           <p>
            Laura Silsby's defender had a warrant out for his arrest for human trafficking.
           </p>
           <p>
            John Podesta was invited to a spirit cooking event by an artist who depicts human sacrifice and luciferianism in her work.
           </p>
           <p>
            Two locations near comet pizza had logos that matched FBI-documented pedophile symbols.
           </p>
           <p>
            Hillary Clinton was seen at one of those locations.
           </p>
           <p>
            Both locations removed the logos when they were discovered as pedophile symbols.
           </p>

            That's the kind of stuff that started the investigation. There has been much, much more since then -- too much to enumerate here. At no point did anyone suggest, in those initial stages, that "Hillary Clinton rapes children in a pizzaria basement" or anything of the sort. That was a claim that was made up and attributed to us to distract and discredit.

Don't fall for this! Jones and 60 mins just happened to say that Comet PP was not with pizzagate on same day! Come on, this is all BS.

             Fantastic job.  I see that someone downvoated it (I upvoated it but it's still at 0).  That is absolutely a shill.  No sincere PGer would downvoat a truth blast like that one!
