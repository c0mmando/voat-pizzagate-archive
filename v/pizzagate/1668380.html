            Any additional info would be helpful.  You sound as though you may know more.  Are you alluding to Amber Alert?  Definitely sounds like you are referencing CF.

            It does seem that action taken to identify and report on the specific corrupt judges can move this in the right direction.
           </p>
           <p>
            The judges in Pennsylvania's 'Kids for Cash' scandal got 28 years &amp; 17.5 years prison time, back in 2009 when families did not have access to Internet opportunities to share information with other families or get support from the online army of  friendly investigators, analysts and agitators like we have here.
           </p>
           <p>
            <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kids_for_cash_scandal">
             https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kids_for_cash_scandal
            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            If judges and corrupt CPS staff now know that information is being shared and outliers identified, they might tone it down. At this stage, while waiting for large scale swamp drainage, any kid saved is a big achievement.

             Unfortunately, going after all the johns and then trying to impress the public with "trafficking arrests" is not going to do it. Neither are meetings to discuss which cronies are involved and how far they are related into PedoRings et al.

              I know that is where my faith starts to slip .  paedophillia is a dark evil sickness  but it is not a disease. I do not believe that a paedophile can be rehabilitated . there is no medication no therapy that is going to fix these people. There sick deviant mind desires the young and innocent they have to have a victim to get there gratification. They take what is suppossed to be an act of love. between 2 adults and twist the fuck out of it and make it evil and they get off on that. Wtf i feel angry everytime i here they might not take down. The top level just the low level. Or just some. Of them. Leave some jail some and what gets better. Nothing even just one left is reinfestation. They all have to go down. some is not good enough. What is so scarey to me is how so many of them are wrapped up in cps, orphanages and other services that gives them easy access to children. I believe the people selling or trading chilren are just as guilty as the paedophiles themselves as is anyone covering up or hiding knowledge of thesr crimes example people calling it fake news so it can continue.  Im with you it is great they are arressting trafficters and all that but i wont be impressed till these polititians the people that control our government lobby our laws pass our laws. The msm anr all the ones making standing in Trumps way of making america great again that are involved in pizzagate. Some oorganizations should be shut down completely and if needed such as cps then a whole new one started with all new people.

            I keep hearing people talk about how Bill Clinton signed the ASFA. Whatever. The point is, HILLARY CLINTON TAKES CREDIT FOR IT!!! (Something proven in the opening statement in the video)

            The US has a shocking number of domestic adoptions compared to other developed countries: Australia, The UK, Germany, The Netherlands and Belgium

            industry since Bill Clinton signed The Adoption and Safe Family Act. And because international adoptions have declined to less than 10.000, the industry requires a steady supply of US children, as well as large pockets of sustained poverty, drug abuse, disabilities and medicalization, strict abortion laws, expensive contraception and early sexualization of children.

            Exactly!  In this 4 min video you'll hear a judge from AZ teaching new judges on how to ensure they get the funding for the children that were removed.  He even goes as far as saying if it's found the kids were wrongfully removed by CPS when he's in that situation he rules to keep the kids and suggests that the parents go on to pursue getting them back in civil court.

            Yes big problem. I have listened to live interviews with ex CPS agents on one of the RBN radio shows, they talk about secret training on how to trick the parents into 'consenting' into a contract with CPS with out them even knowing it!  They show up late Friday, act all friendly and concerned and ask just to see the child, as soon as you agree and they cross the threshold of your door, you have unwittingly entered into that contract giving them power over you and your child.  If you respond appropriately and say get off my lawn, they are taught to escalate and threaten to be back later with a warrant from a judge to take all of your children, and you can't even appeal till Monday. Since the judges are in on the racket, they always do get that warrant because of the lies they tell the judge (BAR traitor to all of us).  One of them also said his only qualification was his music degree for saxophone, got hired, and got 2 weeks training (and the secret training) and he was ready to steal people's kids away from them. They come inside, inspect your kitchen, if there are any dirty dishes in the sink or even 1 beer in the fridge you have an 'unfit' house and that is good enough to take the kids. They are also trained to target kids with disabilities because they are worth more, even ADHD is worth more. The whole thing is a racket to get your kids legally into the hands of pedos.

            It seems that legislation put into effect to help get kids adopted encourages CPS to take 'desirable' kids from their families and put them up for adoption. CAPTA and other state legislation provides bonuses every time a social worker relocates a child, sometimes adding up to more than $20,000.
