<p>&quot;Anyway, enough about that. Here are the basic details of what apparently happened. John &quot;Homer&quot; Van Meter, a self employed logger from Wisconsin, was driving back from a conference in Sonoma County California (in fall 2004) and happened to notice a convoy of cars driving into the woods. He went to investigate and saw something very disturbing taking place.</p>
<p>Van Meter confronted a group of people in the wooded area that were performing some kind of sick satanic ritual on a kidnapped women. He successfully saved the women from her terrible ordeal but was shot several times in the process. Shooting back at his attackers, he apparently shot and killed a number of them, and wounded a few others. When he reported the incident to the Police it went nowhere, and ultimately ended with HIM being charged for filing a false Police report. How do they explain the gunshots Van Meter received? They said he shot himself.</p>
<p>Around 1 and a half years later, Van Meter claims some of the men he wounded in the 2004 incident found out his identity and came back for revenge. A shoot-out ensued, and while John managed to shoot some of his attackers, he himself was shot 5 times. Where this incident took place is a very rural area, so he was lucky to be saved by someone who just happened to be driving by. Again, John &quot;Homer&quot; Van Meter reported this incident to the Police, and yet again, they came to the same conclusion as they did with the first incident. That he had shot himself.</p>

            I recall watching other talks which Ted Gunderson gave where he said that many Satanic cults in the U.S. were creatures of the CIA, so it would not surprise me at all if they enjoy some measure of police protection (the 'Night Stalker' case comes to mind, as it's very likely that there others involved besides Ramirez).  This case is new to me, though.  Thank you for sharing!

            "Could satanic ritual abuse (devil worshippers) actually be a much bigger problem than most people are aware of?"
           </p>
           <p>
            It has been going on for centuries and centuries.  A cult doesn't get powerful overnight.
           </p>
           <p>
            I think it is far worse than imaginable. First off, they've convinced people to join in without people knowing that.
           </p>
           <p>
            All you have to do these days is play a popular hit record and you've got the seeping into one's body (or an energetic frequency, if you will), of the satanic ritual that's performed on that record before it's released.
           </p>
           <p>
            I'm convinced they are performing rituals in every aspect of life (movies, tv, fashion, music, blah blah blah - oh and burning man "festivals") especially anywhere where there are a lot of people, so that more and more people are infected with the darkness.  And the darkness will bring apathy towards SRA and the suffering of children.

            30 years ago this past Labor Day  the wife of a coworker sat me down and told me her story. She wanted to get her story out to as many people as possible.  Her father was a wealthy farmer and their family were involved in generational incest and practicing Satanists.  For 4 hours she told me her life story in great detail . How the people involved in this cult were wealthy successful pillars of the community including judges, lawyers, cops, successful business owners.  People no one would ever suspect. They'd kidnap children and kill them in their black mass rituals that included raping them, skinning them alive and cutting out their hearts and eating them.  I was traumatized for months after hearing her story and grateful to have moved away from that area a few months later. I got PTSD from that conversation.  I tried my best to forget about it.  Nothing had ever terrified me like her story had. 6 years later Cathy O'Brien published her book The Trance-formation of America.  It was several years after that that I finally read that book and was absolutely dumbfounded by the similarities.  My friend's story and the stories I've read from other survivors since then has me convinced that it's true. Jay Parker claims that about 10percent of the population practice these old religions are are passed down thru families since Biblical times. I believe its true. They are still out there, practicing their sick and twisted religions . Thank god for the internet, now their evil ways are being exposed.

             By "old religion" I believe these cultists are referring to the pre-monotheistic form(s) of Judaism. YHWH in the old testament is said to be a cover for a range of ancient dieties including baal-molech. This monotheistic "cover up" may have been done as "recently" as 700 BC

             she has told her story in comments and in a post I did on her. Her family also practiced what you say and the crimes were horrid as well. Her family handed her over to St. Charles Borromeo and a priest Thomas J. Benedtad who was named in the list of names last year in the Pa release of sexual abuser priests. This woman has gone through hell and back. We have communicated many times and yes I had suffered to a few nightmares myself.  The sad thing is that those in high places are trying their best to

             Wow. Hopefully she is ok and living a better life from those 30 years on and that the cult hasn’t got her back. Sometimes with Dissociative Identity Disorder they can get a triggering phone call with sounds or numbers and leave and go back with a personality present. Sounds crazy but true. Yes, the PTSD aspect is so real and that’s wha makes doing this so hard, anyone with empathy can relate. Lastly, the claims that 10% of the country practice evil in its many forms is way off, it is far, far more than that today.

            There’s a case in Wisconsin that happened years ago. A Kid that was around 17 with mental issues and his uncle were charged with strangling a girl. They went to prison. Years later a lawyer group took their case and said he was innocent. There were some really weird things with that case. Now the police are trying him again. Can’t remember his name. Someone here did a post I believe. LE just will not let this case go. There are some strange things that go on in those Wisconsin Woods. We did research on a Child sex op in the woods as well

               There’s an awesome documentary on.... I think Hulu.... about the Michigan case. It’s called Footprints in the Snow or something to that effect and is a 3-part series.

            I recall seeing a 4chan user talk about a former police officer he knew that encountered a cult outside of Durango, Colorado in the 70s and 80s. A frantic woman was screaming and crying hysterically at the station and half of the town showed up at the station angry that one of their breeders escaped and fled for her life. The anon said that half of the businesses were fronts for a cult in this town. I don't know if this was made-up, but it could be true.
