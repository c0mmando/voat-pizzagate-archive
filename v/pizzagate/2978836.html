<p>There once existed in this country a party platform that espoused a few ideals that many of us thought we also held that conveyed a sense of respect and freedom that we all strive to achieve. I believe that most of us have an innate sense of &quot;free&quot; liberal thought mixed in with, what I hope, is a healthy sense of conservatism so as to balance things out. I believe that most of us in the United States would like to see a government based less on sides than somewhere in the middle, <em>but today</em> <strong>BOTH of these parties</strong> have been manipulated, twisted and distorted into creatures that are hardly recognizable not only in politics but in real life are ineffectual, dangerous and evilly corrupt. </p>
<p>Below is a summary of the following video by <strong>Holly Seeliger</strong> from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCsGONrYTksBI250Fbp6fR-g">Zoon Politikon</a> that illustrates how the <strong>Trojan Horse &quot;Progressive&quot; Left Democratic Party</strong> has been utilized and manipulated for that purpose and I will show you how <strong>PIZZAGATE and the Housing market Crash of 2008</strong> was all a part of that continued plan.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Democrats are trying to roll out these <strong>FAKE progressive, FAKE neo-liberals</strong> like <strong>Ocasio-Cortez</strong>, anyone that is a registered new <strong>&quot;Green&quot; Party Democrat</strong> is <strong>FOOLING YOU</strong>. </p>
<p>These people are STILL counting on the <strong>BIG BANKS</strong> and <strong><em>THAT\'S THE IMPORTANT POINT I WANT TO MAKE HERE.</em></strong></p>
<p>The &quot;Green&quot; Independent party of the United States, The &quot;Green Party&quot; of Maine has a &quot;GREEN NEW DEAL&quot; Platform that has been on the books for a very long time talking about <strong>how to fund</strong> the Green <strong>NEW DEAL.</strong></p>
<p>Groups like <strong>Modern Monetary Policy</strong> and <strong>Alexandria Cortez (The Killer)</strong> and even people IN MAINE LIKE <strong>SHELLEY PINGREE</strong>, are still counting on the big banking cartel conglomerates who engage in usury like the <strong>IMF and World Bank</strong> that are bankrupting countries.</p>
<p><strong>The 2008 Housing Market Crash and Bailout</strong> showed us that these Democrats <strong>WILL DO ANYTHING</strong> to bow down to their corporate masters at the tip of a hat. They showed us that these banks were <strong>too big to fail and too big to jail</strong>.</p>
<p>This is how they get into office, this is how the big banks get in and stay and how they enact austerity measures, create depressions, crash economies, steal natural resources from these countries, overthrow governments, use &quot;shadow organizations\' to create fake revolutions, they use the revolutionary cycle to put in puppet regimes, <strong><em>it always goes back to these banking cartels.</em></strong></p>

           There once existed in this country a party platform that espoused a few ideals that many of us thought we also held that conveyed a sense of respect and freedom that we all strive to achieve. I believe that most of us have an innate sense of "free" liberal thought mixed in with, what I hope, is a healthy sense of conservatism so as to balance things out. I believe that most of us in the United States would like to see a government based less on sides than somewhere in the middle,
           <em>
            but today

           <strong>
            BOTH of these parties

           have been manipulated, twisted and distorted into creatures that are hardly recognizable not only in politics but in real life are ineffectual, dangerous and evilly corrupt.

           Below is a summary of the following video by

           that illustrates how the
           <strong>
            Trojan Horse "Progressive" Left Democratic Party
           </strong>
           has been utilized and manipulated for that purpose and I will show you how
           <strong>
            PIZZAGATE and the Housing market Crash of 2008
           </strong>
           was all a part of that continued plan.

            The "Green" Independent party of the United States, The "Green Party" of Maine has a "GREEN NEW DEAL" Platform that has been on the books for a very long time talking about
            <strong>

             The 2008 Housing Market Crash and Bailout
            </strong>
            showed us that these Democrats
            <strong>
             WILL DO ANYTHING

            to bow down to their corporate masters at the tip of a hat. They showed us that these banks were

            Okay, my head is going to explode with a number of connections.  Perhaps someone here can help make sense of this... so, I've just been reading this interview with DeeDee Slewka :

             Filmmaker Stephanie ["DeeDee"] Slewka discusses the perils and advantages of working in an isolated community, the blind faith of filmmaking and how to bribe island teenagers.

             Housing is hard to find on North Haven and there is no hotel or motel. Ask the crew! We stayed in one house in the winter that had no heat upstairs. It was on our first shoot when I was still funding the film myself, so I was too nervous to be cold, but they suffered. I rewarded them with lobster dinners and wine. We rented

            DeeDee Slewka is the vice-chair of Common Good City Farm  in Washington DC:

            . Prince Charles visited and spoke with a murdered actress/yoga teacher/herbalist Tricia McCauley.  I wrote about that here:

            Well since then I've found some actual links to Comet Ping Pong.

           <p>
            As a yoga teacher Tricia worked with Jasmine Chehrazi, founder of Yoga Activist and the Yoga District in DC.  Jasmine knew Sasha Lord and performed at Comet Ping Pong with Amanda Kleinman

            Within my voat post about Tricia McCauley, I had also posted a link to an instagram of a single ballet shoe outside her home in the year that she died:

            After seeing all her connections to THEARC, I remembered that Septime Webre was also there at the time.  This is just speculation of course, but I did find this interesting&gt;&gt;

            <p>
             It was 1999, and Webre had just moved to Adams Morgan from New Jersey to start his new job. Beside him stood Rhonda Buckley, founder of the Sitar Arts Center, which ran after-school programs for underserved children in that damp, windowless room. She was nervously hoping that Webre would consider, at some future date, offering ballet classes for little ones at her center, maybe once she had moved it to a better location.

            Further, the school that took part in the event that Prince Charles attended has links to a large DC lobbying firm, Mrs Bush even gave a speech there and her daughter Jemma worked there while twin sister has connections to SPiN

             Great research, you are hitting the nail on the head and are weaving in and out of the liberal coven that resides in the New England states. These little ciche' Neighborhood Farms and Whole Foods farce is part of their cloak and dagger costuming and has been ever since they were exposed in the Salem Witch Trials. That Septime Weber is intricately connected to all of this it is obvious with his fascination with the Wizard of Oz that he produced in DC.

             Having served for two years in an unrelated AmeriCorps program myself, it's interesting that you bring that up. It has definitely crossed my mind a time or two that some of these programs--particularly those in mentoring and education literacy--may very well serve a much more sinister purpose. It is especially troubling when you consider the fact that a lot of them (Teach for America, for example) provide support to K-12 schools in economically disadvantaged/low-income areas. In no way is that to say that all who serve in these programs have ill intent, but rather, it gives certain individuals access where they wouldn't have had it otherwise.

            </p>
            <p>
             It's definitely worth looking into, given the history of the program. The idea for a national volunteer network was originally proposed by John F. Kennedy and came to fruition under Lyndon B. Johnson's anti-poverty platform + the Economic Opportunity Act of 1964. Early programs such as VISTA and the NCCC were ultimately designated under the AmeriCorps umbrella in 1993; a division of the newly-created Corporation for National and Community Service signed into law via the National and Community Service Trust Act of 1993. In addition to AmeriCorps VISTA and AmeriCorps NCCC, the act also allowed for the establishment of AmeriCorps State and National programs. As a result, communities of all shapes and sizes, in all 50 states, may utilize stakeholder partnerships to apply for and obtain AmeriCorps funding through the CNCS (and thereby establish local or state level AmeriCorps programs to fit the community's needs).

           <p>
            how about the undisputed fact that the housing bubble was from relaxing loan standards for niggers, which is the affirmative-action white-guilt bullshit it is equally undisputed that Jews devised/pushed/implemented?

             First of all every single one of those people that I mentioned in this article is involved in an orchestrated takedown of the United States government right along with CGI, for you to discount that fact at ALL totally negates any reason for you to be here and only reinforces what I am about to say below.
            </p>
            <p>
             What kind of a
             <strong>
              racist intelligence operative piece of shit
             </strong>
             do you have to be to come here and continually DEMAND that we BLAME ALL JEWS and THEN use that kind of language for Black African American's. You are CONTROLLED OPPOSITION and a AGENT PROVOCATEUR to continual POLLUTE my threads with your TRULY ANTISEMITIC BULLSHIT. While I do agree there is a cult of people within Judaism that have attached themselves like leeches, there is no way you can blame an entire grouping of people that may or may not have any idea this entire saga is happening. There's no argument to it and people like you are the reason most of us will be hunted down like DOGS because you can't straighten your fucking head up, but we know why your here anyway is to help that along you fucking
             <strong>
              traitorous piece of shit.
             </strong>
            </p>
            <p>
             I know we all know it and we all think it but I'll just say it here for posterity, we know your either hopelessly retarded and ignorant of all life itself and just SIT here with your dick in your hand just waiting to say something about JOOOOOS ALL FUCKING DAY LONG you are one pathetic motherfucker, OR, YOU DONE GET PAID TO BE HERE. Fuck of you PIECE OF SHIT.

              Yeah I don't feel too awful for supporting the exact same solution hundreds of other societies used in response to ritual child murder.  The problem is there's always some faggot like you letting them back in.  It's not our obligation to prove some arbitrary percentage of them are "involved":
