            Oh...just wanted to add the fact that Scalia's body wasn't autopsied and immediately cremated (illegally, apparently) is what made Duff's claims seem feasible.  Murder seems the case?  Also, the creepy, isolated Texas ranch decorated with masks a' la Eyes Wide Shut, and buzz that some of the "elite" frequent this place adds to the speculation...that, and the claims that up to 40% of Congess are pedo's.

            LoPhatt,
Valid points. Duff hasn't followed up on the Scalia claims as much as one would think, especially considering his claims. I've been going to VT for several years, but lately I've lost a bit of faith in them. I've been censored several times of late when posting in their comment section on various articles, usually for bringing up P-G which they won't touch!  My censored posts seemed somewhat harmless other than bringing up PG.  I'm not one to care for censorship, already happened enough to me with YouTube back when ChemTrails were first making the alternative rounds.
           </p>
           <p>
            Also, I've had correspondences with former VT contributor Katherine Frisk, and she says everything's changed at VT since they brought in Ian Greenhalgh as an editor. Katherine's been blacklisted at VT for the past few months with no explanation. She used to contribute at least weekly there.
           </p>
           <p>
            Anyway...thanks for the thoughtful reply -- let's keep seeking Truth...as IT WILL prevail :)
