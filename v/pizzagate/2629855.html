             What happens when you decide to leak some information about the wife of one of the biggest drug dealers/killers ever and the wife's celebrity helper/money launderer? Well, considering I had not heard from her in months when she said she thought she was being spied on by someone, and now she ended up dead, I guess that is what happens when you get caught. Someone needs to pay.

            The dead woman lived in the same apartment/condo building as the Weiners  called Zechendorf Towers with 29 floors and almost 650 units. She was in the midst of a difficult divorce and was last seen stumbling drunk.  There is not a shred of evidence that she knew the Weiners much less that she was killed by them  or Huma's boss.

            Every poster and lurker here knows how to Google.  It is a shame that every time  a poster raises a challenge to a post or comment, he or she is branded a traitor to the cause. That's shallow thinking, not critical or logical thinking.

                i try to contribute by either adding or subtracting from a post or applauding a good post.  Had you studied logic in college you would recognize faulty premises and faulty inferences. Such thinking is the most vital role of a lawyer  and we actually get paid for it.

                 This has no bearing on pizzagate or Huma Abedin, please remove, did you post this in bad faith???? Even Stormy Daniels arrest and subsequent dismissal of charges this week.has more relevancy and you missed that.

            The dead woman lived in the same condo/apartment complex as the Weiners. It is called  Zechendorf Towers with 29 floors and almost 650 units.  The woman was in the midst of a difficult divorce and was last seen stumbling drunk. There has not been a single iota of evidence  presented that she even knew the Weiners much less that she was murdered by one of them or murdered by Huma's boss.

            I learned this by quickly perusing a dozen articles by Googling, a skill that is shared by every poster and lurker here.
           </p>
           <p>
            That all share the same level of critical thinking skills is questionable.  Whenever a falsehood or illogical point is made which challengers a member's post,  the commentator is immediately branded a traitor to the cause of pizzagate.  Oh, how I wish that logic and debate were part of the school.curriculum for middle school and high school.  The erroneous inferences that are made from a few factoids is scary and has implications for personal relationships, society and politics and law enforcement.

            : I am flairing this 'Possible Disinformation', since there is no evidence that the woman was the renter of the Abedin/Weiner apartment. We will remove the flair if you find a reliable source that proves she rented her apartment from the couple.

            We need to wait for more information.  We also know that LE has a tendency to fudge the info. Not saying there is something to this, just that we need to wait.  We need the name and age of this woman and any other available information.

                You mean before they heard why cops were in the building, they thought it might have to do with Weiner's arrest.  Because that is what the news reports say.  So  these folks had limited information and made a guess.  That guess turned out to be wrong.
               </p>
               <p>
                You can contrast this with the actual Weiner case which didn't involve an army of cops.  It involved his lawyer negotiating with the US attorney and then turning himself in.
