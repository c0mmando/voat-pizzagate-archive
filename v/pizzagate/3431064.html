<p>Okay this is really a repost of <a href="https://voat.co/v/GreatAwakening/3431002#submissionTop">&quot;What? Epstein was a key architect of the riskiest and most dangerous products ever devised to promote the Wall Street ponzi&quot;</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>By way of Liquid Funding Ltd, Jeffrey Epstein did have that crucial link to Bear Stearns, and a very serious one. Seldom — as in never — noted in the press, Epstein was a key architect of the riskiest and most dangerous products ever devised to promote the Wall Street ponzi. The acronyms HELX CBOS CLOS were Bear Stearns products, should stand out from the page shown like beacons to every reader, financial constructs heavily leveraged by Jeffrey Epstein from 2001 until 2007.</p>
<p>HEL is of course a home equity line of credit, while CBO represents collateralized bond obligations and CLO represents collateralized loan obligations. The year was 2007, and the bubble was just beginning to burst; Epstein created, modified and employed the riskiest products on Wall Street, which eventually caused the entire US financial system to crash.</p>
<p>Now, the reason Jeffrey Epstein is key to the financial crash of 2008-2009 is because he had the backing of the largest investors on Wall Street to enable him to do his derivative dirty work and the real key connection to Bear Stearns. He invested for multi-billionaire Leon Black. &gt;</p>
<p>He invested for multi-billionaire Les Wexner, and arguably Epstein leveraged these dangerous products on behalf of the most influential investors on Wall Street – and for Bear Stearns. And he did it offshore with no accountability.</p>
<p>So this is the solution to the mystery of Jeffrey Epstein not that he is a blackmailer or Israeli spy or middleman for the New World Order – even if he is all of those things – no, he is the criminal who worked on behalf of America’s most powerful billionaires and Bear Stearns, to bring down the US financial system, to then deliver even greater wealth to those billionaires today, in the aftermath of that collapse.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>please note that the article is NOT saying he isn\'t all of the above, other articles cover those aspects</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Thus, Epstein’s secret must be the secret that the Political Class does not want you to know, or to ever learn: that he is the enabler for the financial destruction of the US in 2008, and not just responsible for the destruction of young lives.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>According to a database created by The International Consortium of Investigative Journalists containing files leaked from the law firm Appleby, Jeffrey Epstein, who is under indictment as a sex trafficker and assaulter of underage girls, was the Chairman of Liquid Funding Ltd. from November 9, 2001 to at least March 19, 2007. The offshore business had been incorporated in Bermuda on October 19, 2000 and according to the Fitch ratings firm, it had $6.7 billion in outstanding liabilities in 2006.</p>
<p>In a regulatory filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission in February 2003, Bear Stearns, the Wall Street investment bank that Epstein had resigned from under murky circumstances in 1981, confirmed that it was a 40 percent owner of Liquid Funding Ltd., writing as follows:</p>
<p>“At November 30, 2002, the Company had an approximate 40% equity interest in Liquid Funding, Ltd. (‘LFL’), a AAA-rated special purpose vehicle established to participate in the repurchase agreement and total return swap markets. A subsidiary of the Company acts as investment manager…”</p>
<p>The subsidiary that acted as investment manager for Liquid Funding Ltd. was Bear Stearns Bank Plc in Dublin, Ireland, which functioned outside of U.S. regulatory authority and was a wholly owned subsidiary of Bear Stearns Ireland Limited, which was wholly owned by the U.S.-regulated Bear Stearns Companies Inc.. The U.S.-based Bear Stearns was one of the myriad Wall Street banks that imploded during the financial crisis of 2008 and received both publicly-announced and secret bailouts from the Federal Reserve, the central bank of the United States, via its Wall Street compromised regional bank, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.</p>
<p>Just who it was that owned the remaining 60 percent of Liquid Funding Ltd. is unknown at this time, but if the off-balance sheet structure follows the typical pattern, a number of those listed in the leaked documents as serving as a director or officer, including Epstein, are likely to have invested funds.</p>
<p>According to an October 24, 2006 announcement from the ratings agency, Fitch, Liquid Funding Ltd. was a Structured Investment Vehicle (SIV) — the same structure that played a major role in blowing up another major Wall Street bank, Citigroup, during the financial tsunami that cratered Wall Street in 2008. (See Law Firm that Silenced Harvey Weinstein Accusers also Involved in SIVs that Tanked Citigroup.)</p>
<p>According to Fitch, Liquid Funding Ltd. could issue liabilities up to $20 billion, made up of commercial paper, guaranteed investment contracts, medium term notes, and repurchase agreements. Both Fitch and Moody’s gave the medium-term notes to be issued by Liquid Funding a AAA-rating as well as gave it a AAA-rating as a counterparty. And, notably, both ratings agencies gave its commercial paper a Tier 1 rating, meaning that it could now end up in money market funds purchased by average Americans seeking a low-risk, liquid investment. (Until 2008, it was rare for money market funds to “break a buck,” meaning give back less than the original principal invested.)</p>
<p>While the ratings agencies acknowledged that they understood the entity could issue up to $20 billion in various instruments, Fitch reported in 2006 that “Liquid Funding is capitalized with $37 million in drawn equity commitments and $63 million in undrawn equity commitments….” We have found nothing, thus far, to explain how $100 million in equity could support $20 billion in liabilities (other than possibly the fact that Deutsche Bank is still alive). It can’t be that Bear Stearns was guaranteeing the liabilities because Bear stated in a regulatory filing that “The Company’s maximum exposure to loss as a result of its investment in this entity is approximately $5.0 million.”</p>
<p>As a result of those Tier 1 ratings on Liquid Funding’s commercial paper, it ended up in some very big name money market funds. Two of JPMorgan’s money market funds held a total of $100 million; two Dreyfus money markets held at least $139 million; and a Frank Russell money market fund held $125 million. Those amounts are very likely the tip of the iceberg that ended up in money market funds.</p>
<p>The amount of toxic debris that had parked itself in supposedly safe money market funds in 2008 led to unprecedented action by the U.S. Treasury, which had to step in with a guarantee plan after a run commenced when it was learned that the bankrupt Lehman Brothers had sold its instruments to money market funds.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>And that was just the beginning of bailing out the unprecedented greed and corruption that turned the Wall Street gambling casino into a ward of the U.S. taxpayer. If you were a hedge fund for billionaires or a foreign bank and the insolvent U.S. insurance company, AIG, owed you money because you failed to do your due-diligence in the selection of a derivatives counterparty, you got secretly bailed out at 100 cents on the dollar.</p>

            I am wondering if Epstein's dealings on Wall Street if in any way resemble what Frank Giustra did on the ( now defunct) Vancouver Stock Exchange which, because of corruption, had to be shut down. Funny that Clinton hung out with guys like Epstein and Giustra, both in their way, played a role I believe, in collapsing economies in their respective countries.

             Good point, I had been wondering about Giustra vs Epstein as far as their 'rags to riches'-esque financial wizard branding, but I had forgotten about Giustra and the Vancouver Stock Exchange.  Well worth reviewing.  In some ways, Soros fits the MO as well (e.g. underdog builts amazing financial empire).

              The Capital Holdings Funds family of funds started in 1969 with the launch of Leveraged Capital Holdings, the first multi-manager fund of its type in the world. Our philosophy has remained the same throughout: pursue the most talented managers suited to the expected market conditions and allocate to them in a way that results in an exceptional track record of capital appreciation over the medium to long term and through many different environments, while reducing volatility.
             </p>
             <p>
              Our investment process is extraordinary, the funds benefit from the active involvement of experienced investors who participate in the Investment Advisory Committees and on the Board of the Company. They are supported by a dedicated team at Edmond de Rothschild Capital Holdings Limited, which is the Principal Supporting Services Company of the family of funds.
