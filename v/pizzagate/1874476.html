             The vast majority of plea deals are in exchange for not having to have a trial.  Only a small amount involve other cases.  There has never been any inkling from law enforcement/prosecutors anything else was involved in this case.  The idea that  Weiner's laptop had evidence of a litany of other crimes was a deliberate hoax.  A hoax many on this board still enthusiastically push, but still a hoax.

              While the vast majority of plea deals are in exchange for not having a trial, if there are several defendants in the case often a deal is made for some to testify against one of the others.  The more important a case is, the more likely a plea involves testimony.  A drug bust of one person might get a plea deal in exchange for reducing the number of charges or the sentence.  An accomplice in a robbery or murder might get a plea deal in exchange for testimony against his partner.

             <blockquote>
              <p>
               In plea bargains, prosecutors usually agree to reduce defendants' punishment. They often accomplish this by reducing the number or severity of the charges against defendants. They might also agree to recommend that defendants receive reduced sentences. Some plea bargains require defendants to do more than simply plead guilty. For example, prosecutors often offer favorable plea bargains to defendants who agree to testify for the state in cases against other defendants.

              Please explain how you know that Weiner's laptop had no evidence of other crimes?  Why were some of Hillary's e-mails on the laptop
              <a href="http://www.zerohedge.com/news/2016-10-29/fbi-found-tens-thousands-emails-belonging-huma-abedin-weiners-laptop">
               http://www.zerohedge.com/news/2016-10-29/fbi-found-tens-thousands-emails-belonging-huma-abedin-weiners-laptop
              </a>
              It may be that there is nothing further on his computer about Pizzagate or pedophilia, but if any of them were classified, finding them on his computer is a crime - perhaps he will rat on his wife Huma who apparently forwarded them to his laptop.
              <br/>
              I don't know if Weiner is going to talk.  But I expect that if he does in exchange for a plea and a reduced sentence he may well have something interesting to say.  If he dies suddenly I am sure we can assume he had stuff to say that others did not want said.

               The FBI has already closed  the email investigation.  Mishandling classified information is not automatically a crime.  This is why it was such an easy call in the first go round of this.
              </p>
              <p>
               My evidence of no other crimes is the prosecutor has always indicated that this was a limited case.  The stories that NYPD was ready make a wave of arrests on cases of stomach turning crimes , but only held back due to federal pressure were transparently false.   They were a hoax written by someone who knew the conspiracy audience would respond to them like a kitten on catnip.

            So another political person related to child sex. And another plea deal. Guessing the sentence will be counted in months, possibly not even in jail.

            On the positive side, we have a conviction coming up on the pizzagate front, however small.
