<p>In that post a connection between the occultic Process Church and the Rothschilds is reprinted from an article, as there are seeming ties between the military, elite families and their estates which were used for various purposes during WW2, propaganda units and the CIA:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I exposed one of the Rothschild properties in the early 90’s which was used for satanic rituals for the Process Church, a neo-Gnostic spinoff of the OTO. About 20 miles west of Sandy Hook, Conn. is the county of Westchester (NY). The Rothschilds owned an estate there which had a church bldg. but the main mansion had burned down.</p>

<p>The Warburg family <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warburg_family">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warburg_family</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Warburg family is a prominent German and American banking family of German Jewish and originally Venetian Jewish descent, noted for their varied accomplishments in biochemistry, botany, political activism, economics, investment banking, law, physics, classical music, art history, pharmacology, physiology, finance, private equity and philanthropy.[</p>
<p>A former townhouse of Felix Warburg\'s in Manhattan, New York City.
Felix and Paul Warburg emigrated to the United States. Felix Warburg married Frieda Schiff, daughter of Jacob H. Schiff, a banker who grew up in Frankfurt. <strong>Schiff financed parts of the American rail system through his investment bank Kuhn Loeb.</strong> Schiff\'s great great grandson Drew married Al Gore\'s daughter Karenna.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Interestingly, this article on the Stanley Kubrick film \'Eyes Wide Shut\' also seems to come to some similar conclusions: <a href="http://kubrickistan.blogspot.com/2013/07/my-katonah-with-apologies-to-knack_18.html">http://kubrickistan.blogspot.com/2013/07/my-katonah-with-apologies-to-knack_18.html</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Also recall that the exterior shots of the orgy mansion was Mentmore Towers, a former Rothschild mansion (something Weidner also points out in the interview). From page 416 of the same edition,
&quot;The abandoned church (site of rituals) in central Westchester... was immediately identified by Captain Gerry Buckholt... as the nearby \'burned out\' mansion, which turned out to be the former Warburg-Rothschild estate. &quot;</p>

<p>In this book <a href="https://books.google.ch/books?id=BYEOCwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA105&amp;lpg=PA105&amp;dq=process+church+and+warburg+estate&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=Bs8k6T4Ah5&amp;sig=3zoL-IAjSrUAYztMsKiyk2S-1nQ&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwju8ZyMmJ7dAhWG16QKHYCNANsQ6AEwCHoECAgQAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=process%20church%20and%20warburg%20estate&amp;f=false">\'Virtual Government: CIA Mind Control Operations in America\'</a>, there are also references to those connections.</p>
<p>Now, we\'ve recently had a series of posts on the Biltmore Estate and its part in WW2, storing great art pieces away, its secret tunnels, and its use as a redistribution center : <a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/2686121/13618753">https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/2686121/13618753</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>In the new World War II movie “The Monuments Men,” George Clooney and Matt Damon are army officers assigned to save historic artworks before they are plundered or destroyed by Hitler.</p>
<p>Asheville’s Biltmore Estate played a similar top-secret role when precious art was stashed at the big house during the war.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Well it seems that SHAEF was involved with Biltmore too. At the website The Monument\'s Men for the Preservation of Art: <a href="https://www.monumentsmenfoundation.org/the-heroes/the-monuments-men/smyth-lt.-craig-hugh-usnr">https://www.monumentsmenfoundation.org/the-heroes/the-monuments-men/smyth-lt.-craig-hugh-usnr</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>In 1942 Smyth enlisted in the U.S. Navy Reserves and served as an instructor first at Newport Naval Training Base and later at the U.S. Navy Reserve Midshipmen\'s School at Columbia University. In April 1945 he was selected for service with the MFAA. He arrived in Europe alongside fellow USNR Monuments Officer Lt. Cdr. Thomas Carr Howe, Jr. in May 1945. The pair reported to Monuments Man Lt. Col. Geoffrey Webb, head of the MFAA Section at SHAEF Headquarters at Versailles, and were assigned to SHAEF’s G-5 Division (Civil Affairs). </p>
</blockquote>
<p>And there are many more examples like that.  The more I read up the \'history\' on this, the more it seems that we haven\'t been told everything.</p>
<p>Just a reminder, Gloria Vanderbilt did an interview with Charlie Rose about the suicide of her elder son (I suppose she trusted him) where she mentions that she was just 13 feet away from her son when he went over the ledge. She also makes quite an unusual comment: <a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/2686121/13625618">https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/2686121/13625618</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>\'you can survive the very worst thing that can happen, and, you must survive because it quickens the whole vibrations of the earth if you can. It\'s very, very important.\' <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvzZTXT_EG0">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvzZTXT_EG0</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>So I guess it\'s no surprise that as the Biltmore Estate was used to \'store art\' during WW2, Gertrude Vanderbilt Whitney would go on to found the Whitney Museum of Art.  
</p>
<p>Wonder what they were doing in Cuba with James Alefantis? <a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/2700407/13705285">https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/2700407/13705285</a></p>',

           Well it seems that SHAEF was involved with Biltmore too. At the website The Monument's Men for the Preservation of Art:

In April 1945 he was selected for service with the MFAA. He arrived in Europe alongside fellow USNR Monuments Officer Lt. Cdr. Thomas Carr Howe, Jr. in May 1945. The pair reported to Monuments Man Lt. Col. Geoffrey Webb, head of the MFAA Section at SHAEF Headquarters at Versailles, and were assigned to SHAEF’s G-5 Division (Civil Affairs).

           And there are many more examples like that.  The more I read up the 'history' on this, the more it seems that we haven't been told everything.

           Just a reminder, Gloria Vanderbilt did an interview with Charlie Rose about the suicide of her elder son (I suppose she trusted him) where she mentions that she was just 13 feet away from her son when he went over the ledge. She also makes quite an unusual comment:

           So I guess it's no surprise that as the Biltmore Estate was used to 'store art' during WW2, Gertrude Vanderbilt Whitney would go on to found the Whitney Museum of Art.

            Warburg:
           </p>

            Tavistock – The Best Kept Secret in America -
            <a href="https://www.attackonamerica.net/911-attacks/tavistock/">
             https://www.attackonamerica.net/911-attacks/tavistock/
            </a>
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             Another prominent Tavistock operation is the Wharton School of Finance, at the University of Pennsylvania. A single common denominator identifies the common Tavistock strategy—the use of drugs. The infamous MK Ultra program of the CIA, in which unsuspecting CIA officials were given LSD, and their reaction studied like “guinea pigs”, resulted in several deaths.
            </p>
            <p>
             The U.S. Government had to pay millions in damages to the families of the victims, but the culprits were never indicted. The program originated when Sandoz AG, a Swiss drug firm, owned by S.G. Warburg Co. of London, developed Lysergic Acid [LSD]. Roosevelt’s advisor, James Paul Warburg, son of Paul Warburg who wrote the Federal Reserve Act, and nephew of Max Warburg who had financed Hitler, set up the
             <a href="http://watch.pair.com/FreedomHouse.html#ips">
              http://watch.pair.com/FreedomHouse.html#ips
             </a>
             Institute for Policy Studies to promote the drug. The result was the LSD “counter-culture” of the 1960s, the “student revolution”, which was financed by $25 million from the CIA.
            </p>
            <p>
             This is the legacy of the Warburgs and the CIA. Their principal agency, the Institute for Policy Studies, was funded by James Paul Warburg; its co-founder was Marcus Raskin, protege of McGeorge Bundy, president of the Ford Foundation. Bundy had Raskin appointed to the post of President Kennedy’s personal representative on the National Security Council, and in 1963 funded Students for Democratic Society, through which the CIA operated the drug culture.
            </p>
            <p>
             Today the Tavistock Institute operates a $6 Billion a year network of Foundations in the U.S., all of it funded by U.S. taxpayers’ money.
            </p>
            <p>
             One of the key agencies as a conduit for secret instructions from Tavistock is the Ditchley Foundation, founded in 1957. The American branch of the Ditchley Foundation is run by Cyrus Vance, former Secretary of State, and director of the Rockefeller Foundation, and Winston Lord, president of the Council on Foreign Relations.
            </p>
            <p>
             University of Pennsylvania, Wharton School of Finance &amp; Commerce Founded by Eric Trist One of the “brain trusts” of Tavistock, Wharton has become one of the more important Tavistock in so far as “Behavioral Research” is concerned. Wharton attracts clients such as the U.S. Department of Labor—which teaches how to produce “cooked” statistics at the Wharton Econometric Forecasting Associates Incorporated. This method was very much in demand as we came to the close of 1991 with millions more out of work than was reflected in USDL statistics. Wharton’s ECONOMETRIC MODELING is used by every major Committee of 300 company in the United States, Western Europe, the International Monetary Fund, the United Nations, and the World Bank. Institute for Social Research Among its clients are The Ford Foundation, U.S.Department of Defense, U.S.Postal Service and the U.S. Department of Justice. Among its studies are “The Human Meaning Of Social Change”, “Youth in Transition” and “How Americans View Their Mental Health”.

           <blockquote>
            <p>
             In 1950, the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) surreptitiously created the Congress for Cultural Freedom (CCF) to counter the Cominform’s “peace offensive”(Wilford 101). The Congress had “offices in thirty-five countries, employed dozens of personnel, published over twenty prestige magazines, held art exhibitions, owned a news and features service, organized high-profile international conferences, and rewarded musicians and artists with prizes and public performances” at its peak (Saunders 2000). The intent of these endeavors was to “showcase” US and European high culture, including not just musical works but paintings, ballets, and other artistic avenues, for the benefit of neutralist foreign intellectuals (Wilford 102).

Havana is in Cuba, which is to the right of Mexico, JA travelled to Cuba and stated this about the trip:
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             Before his life became consumed by the madness of Pizzagate, restaurateur James Alefantis, the man behind Comet Ping Pong and Buck’s Fishing and Camping, took a trip to Cuba last year with the board of the Whitney Museum of American Art. He invited Nathan to join him, even though they would have different aims. Alefantis had art business to attend to. Nathan was there to visit “like all the Jews in Havana,” Alefantis jokes. “We met all these young Jewish Cubans.”
            </p>

            The sign was exactly the fucking same

            The sign is from Providence Biltmore in Rhode Island which is a creepy looking hotel.. almost resembles a mental asylum?

            states that Nathan's mother was grand dame of Providence:
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             If Joan Nathan seems distracted, she has plenty of reasons to be. Her mother, the grand dame of Providence, R.I., passed away in February at age 103 while Nathan was visiting.

"I've received information from INS, the FBI, the State Department," Torres said from the living room of her apartment on Chicago's north side.

                  The Cuban government has dug about 21 miles of tunnels for use as bomb shelters beneath Havana in preparation for an expected invasion by the United States, Cuba's official news agency said Sunday.

                  Can anyone who has been to Havana recently advise of the status of the tunnels? I know the big one in particular that connects Havana to the east portion (Havana del este?)... I believe there's another one from Miramar to Havana also. I recall seeing reports of these being flooded when the hurricane came... are they open yet? Also, the Malecon continues to be closed? Would appreciate hearing from those who have recently returned

                  As well as the three mentioned in Havana there is a tunnel on the autopista to Santiago and one on the road from there to Guantanamo. I am sure there are others.

              <p>
               "Another, somewhat known, reason that both the American and British governments took great interest in the location and ownership of European valuable works of art was that the Nazis had the potential to use them to finance “subversive activities” both during and after the war. In 1942, the Office of Strategic Services (the OSS) was established. A precursor to today’s CIA, according to the National Archives, the OSS worked very closely to track the movement of these “assets.” The capturing of these assets would hinder Germany’s financial backing of the war effort. Additionally, as documented and exposed by former US ambassador to the European Union Stuart Eizenstat in the 90s, the Nazis were looting a good chunk of this artwork from Jewish people, as they were systematically trying to kill them off. The Nazis were using stolen assets from Jews as collateral to finance (with complicit Swiss banks) the killing of them and their families."

             <strong>
              Woodrow Wilson s Great Mistake: Self-Determination and the Theosophical Concept of Peace In 1944
             </strong>
             , an American architect named Marion Mahony wrote an essay imagining a post-war world in which a sense of responsibility to the other would bind different races, nationalities, and species together. At the time of the essay s drafting, Mahony who in 1898 became the first woman to be licensed as an architect in the United States had just completed laying out the site plan for a pacifist commune in New Hampshire. Called the World Fellowship Center, this place gathered Theosophists and members of other heterodox movements in order to convert the war effort into a lasting global peace.
            </p>
            <p>
             Mahony s 1944 essay did not make any direct reference to the physical layout of the World Fellowship Center, but it shared the Center's conceptual outlook and conviction that hostile feelings could be converted into their opposite. Specifically, Mahony s essay distilled the disparate cries of American isolationism and anti-colonial nationalism into an opportunity to create a borderless, worldwide economic community that shared a single international currency. This paper interrogates the practice of condensing discontinuous claims into a constitutive moment as a literary habit one that drew on the circulation, excerpting, and reprinting of news stories on imperial policy and anti-imperial struggles across the Anglophone world. Crucially, the abstract entity produced by this habit was neither the colonial state nor its nationalist alter ego. Instead, it was a globalizing mechanism that lacked attachment to territory and demos. By examining
             <strong>
              the Theosophical Society s transnational inquiry into the League of Nations and Woodrow Wilson s principle of national self-determination
             </strong>
             , this paper uncovers an internal dispute within modern occultism over the precise character of the mechanism needed to guarantee global peace. Prominent exponents of occult science like J.J. van der Leeuw attributed the failure of the
             <strong>
              League of Nations
             </strong>
             to its lack of a superstate police force, whereas others like Marion Mahony called for the formation of supranational, non-governmental organization.

tells it in such a way that the recipient does not think he is receiving any propaganda... [...] The art of

            There is a beautiful large hotel in Asheville, NC, Grove Park Inn. Presidents and F Scott Fitzgerald stayed there. It was used during WWII to house German prisoners of war....or so the tour guide said. Wonder what kind of prisoners of war they were? Not your average soldier, I would say. Not too far away is a little town, Hot Springs which has some very revitalizing springs.That small town was also said to house German prisoners of war..they built houses there and were an active part of the community. The locals got along with them...were proud that they brought their music and skills to them.Western NC has some very important ley line crossings which give power to (stay with me).Catholic cathedrals and military posts are built on the crossings.(not something that is commonly known, hard to even google and find info) Now, there is a large underground base being built under Mt. Mithchell..a local woman, citizen journalist, talks to the Native Americans in the area and also researches. She sees huge military drops by air into the underground facility...reports good military are surveilling the development.........the enormously wealthy have a lot of houses in two local towns ...Highlands and Cashiers.......thinks that they would go underground if war broke out...or worse...The UN owns the area although it is a National Park......https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z86RyqIVb3E....Ley lines and

             Thanks for this your posts are always informative. Yes, ley lines or earths energy lines are where Masonic temples are built as well I’ve read about this. Further, u are correct about the “elite” going underground when war breaks out, this is 100% truth. They have built massive structures underground with crops for food, water, and suites done in marble and just like hotel. I know hard to believe but I really looked into this and was dumbfounded by what I read and saw. There is speculation that’s because we’ve been sprayed with aluminum so much via chemtrails and it’s in crops sprayed, deodorant, etc that they will turn up the tower voltage of some sort as it’s in low frequency now but if they do and we are exposed we will all die. It’s a frightening thought and speculation but also could be plausible.

              that is VERY interesting to me, since I live a mile or two from a Masonic temple... especially. Where can I get more info on this? The masonic lodge and retirement home near where I live is on some major land and it's also where one of my friends got molested as a kid while visiting another friend from school whose dad lived there.

             Have read that Penn . and Ohio were two states where Nazis settled after the war, because they already had a large German population. Cathy O'Brian has written in her book , Trance Formation of America, that they had a "finishing school" in Ohio , so called which was used for training of girls for MKUltra..large mafia population.Ohio has a huge mafia population...is where the enormous controversy went on re  rigged elections to put g bush into office. Mafia is the military arm for the catholic church, Penn. is also very corrupt ..Sandusky...there are some states that are worse than others...is there a correlation? . . There is also a correlation with abused men and children. During WWII , the boys were being sexually abused so frequently by nazi troops, the Italian mothers went to Germany and talked to the wives. The abuse stopped. This is a "tell" as they say in poker for fascism ... Kay Griggs spoke of the Marines having an indoctrination to young men..if they obeyed, they could be blackmailed and move up the ladder for promotion.Accept rape...Hard to believe America is fascist but just look at Amazon's logo. Take a good hard look.""Fascism should more properly be called corporatism because it is the merger of state and corporate power." Benito Mussolini.

            In the 1800s Commodore Vanderbilt consulted Victoria Woodhull, a medium, on which shares he should invest in.  He did very well from her talking to the dead. It is said that he shared his profits with her and her sister 50/50. The sisters did so well they could afford to buy themselves some rooms in New York and set up a brokerage firm.

"Now, calm down, ma'am. THIS KIND OF CRIME IS FAR MORE COMMON IN THESE MOUNTAINS THAN MOST FOLKS KNOW. And DON'T even trust the police you think are working with you, BECAUSE MANY OF THEM ARE ACTUAL SATANISTS." (Admission from the North Carolina Bureau of Victim Justice.) ... Hear the confession of a former high school student I personally interviewed:
"We skinned that baby alive to the scream of 'hail, Satan!' We then draped it's intestines around the candlesticks of our altar. I cut the baby up into pieces, and each person ate some. Later, I took the skull and remains home. I forced the remains down the garbage disposal to conceal evidence from the police, and then burned a candle to Satan on the baby's skull.And when the mother, my girlfriend, felt bad about giving up her baby for sacrifice and went tot he police, we decided to make an example out of her as a warning to the rest of the coven: NO ONE NARCS ON US TO THE POLICE AND GETS AWAY WITH IT!"

             The satanists in the mountains of North Carolina are never shy about announcing their presence. In fact, they have often let it be known that they are quite proud of their exploits! But then, why not? The jewel of Asheville, NC, is the famed "Biltmore Estate, " former home of the the great Illuminati Satanist millionaire, George Vandebilt! In his Illuminati mansion, one large room contains a coven's table, with 13 seats on either side. On the door is a plaque with the words, "Assemblage of the Gods." Indeed, the Satanists of Asheville and elsewhere all consider themselves to be little "gods" unto themselves. And it is reported that covens often meet in this room by night to discuss HOW THEY WILL BRING FORTH THE COMING LUCIFERIC NEW WORLD ORDER.

             I lived outside Asheville  , 30 minute drive into town. Largest county in NC but only had one stop light. A neighbor who was born and raised there said there were people who met in the woods and worshipped Satan.At the time, was not particularly interested in what he had to say. In retrospect, would guess the satanism was widespread there. My house was haunted and 2 men killed themselves over the property.......another local had hung himself in the barn. Would not have bought the house if I had known. Was sitting by a creek next to my house with a friend praying to God to help me move away. A snake bit my friend. Kept having accidents in sprucing up the place to sell it.

             Rosicrucian mystic Sidney Mttron Hirsch was an American model and playwright. He was a model for sculptors Auguste Rodin and
             <strong>
              Gertrude Vanderbilt Whitney
             </strong>
             . He was a member of The Fugitives.
            </p>
            <p>
             At the time Ransom's Fugitive circle was formed, the main Fabian Society publication was a journal called The New Age, which was financed by the Fabian playwright, and promoter of Friedrich Nietzsche, George Bernard Shaw and published by a Theosophist, Alfred Richard Orage, who
             <strong>
              later became a disciple of the Russian mystic, Georg Gurdjieff
             </strong>
             . In The New Age, the works of Fabians Shaw, H.G. Wells, G.K. Chesterton, and Hilaire Belloc, appeared alongside those of the leading Satanist of the 20th Century, the self-proclaimed "Great Beast",
             <strong>
              Aleister Crowley
             </strong>
             , and assorted other pornographers and mystics like William Butler Yeats, future Fascist spy Ezra Pound, T.S. Eliot, and D.H. Lawrence.
            </p>
            <p>
             <strong>
              Gurdjieff is directly linked to Marina Abramovic
             </strong>
             , as well as Bartlesville. His 'Fourth Way' is intimately tied to the development of Abramovic's 'Method' and her 'spirit cooking' via Abramovic's repeated description of Gurdjieff as her spiritual "father." The common denominator between Abramovic's Method and Gurdjieff's Fourth Way is the use of the body, body movement, and physical experience as a medium for "spiritual development" /mental and emotional change and altered states.
            </p>
            <p>
             Sources discussing the 'left hand path' also include chapters on theosophy and Buddhism. A descritption of Gurdjieff's fourth way can be found in "Lords Of The Left Hand Path," by Stephen Flowers, a self described practitioner of the 'Left Hand Path,' who associated with
             <strong>
              Michael Aquino
             </strong>
             .
            </p>
            <p>
             An entire chapter of this text is dedicated to Gurdjieff's Fourth Way. This, from an associate of Aquino, further illustrates that Gurdjieff and his cult was using a state of nonverbal bodily awareness for explicitly harmful purposes.

             That's actually an interesting idea. If you consider the rich elite players involved that buy the overpriced dog shit; building out the nodes across the pedo cabal networks and "money-launders" would be another vector to unravel the networks....after all, the same perps who recruited Nazis and got them over hear safely before the Trials...were the same perps at  "the company" that started the modern art shit-show (

             ) who then learned from the Nazis on how systematize mind control in controlled clinical settings that morphed into the MK U Program. Why else would rich elite buy dog shit art?

            Her work has been described as cinematic, profound and provocative and features the use of theatrical techniques to enhance and manipulate her photographs in a number of different ways. The subjects are often young girls and two of her well-known series of photographs, “Wonder” and “Override” are loosely based on Lewis Carroll's “ Alice in Wonderland”.

            There’s that ref again…”Alice in Wonderland.” Having just read neonrevolts.com post today regarding the author Lewis C in the context of a discussed Q drop and associated topic of  “White Rabbits.” (Folks I don’t have an opinion on the Q phenom…I’ll stay out of that.)
But in that socialite party held at the Podesta’s house there’s Alefantis in the pics circa 2004. T. Podesta owns (according to another link:
            <a href="https://steemit.com/pizzagate/">
             https://steemit.com/pizzagate/
            </a>
            @gizmosia/art-podesta-admires-and-buys-you-may-never-sleep-well-again) the largest collection of Gaskell art.
           </p>
           <p>
            It doesn’t take a rocket scientist that the Podestas' taste in art is the metaphysical value equivalent of a bucket of feces, if not downright depraved. Anyway, this context above is to keep within the spirt of the thread. I suspect one way to kick the cabal in the teeth is to keep putting together the nodes in the network. At this point in time its gotta be the largest open source\crowd source investigation?
           </p>
           <p>
            Gaskell’s art (I wouldn’t call it that) like the Abromovic is depraved.

            , you've got a lot of stuff in this thread, but no thesis about what is directly relevant to PG here and why it's worth investigating. All I see is this:
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             This post is relevant to pizzagate because of our interest in the rainbow symbolism as it pertains to the research on pedophilia.
            </p>
           </blockquote>
           <p>
            You speak of "rainbow symbolism" as if it is common knowledge and something frequently discussed, which is not the case. Please edit this post to give a summary explanation of this other thread you reference:
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             It was research for the following post which first alerted me to the use of the rainbow as a symbol during the Second World war : Jimmy Savile &gt; the Process Church of the Final Judgement &gt; the House of Rothschild &gt; Alefantis and David Brock's ex boyfriend William Grey &gt; Ed Buck
            </p>
           </blockquote>
           <p>
            Research posts here need to do more than quote or link to historical information or past threads. They need to analyze that information and give the relevance:
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             2: Empiricism: EACH factual claim that is not common knowledge must be sourced...If you present opinion/argument, connect your dots and provide sources for them.
            </p>
            <p>
             3: Clarity: All titles must adequately describe post content and must establish direct relevance to pizzagate. EACH link in your post must include a description of content and how the link relates to the post
            </p>
           </blockquote>
           <p>
            Flairing per Rules 1, 2, and 3 so you can edit this. Thank you.

              I think RealityIsInsanity's comment was in response to Aurasects who deserved at least 100 fy's.  (I don't always understand how the positioning of comments works. Probably because  I have an extremely low IQ as Aurasects has already noted. )

            this is what I don't get about you people.
           </p>
           <p>
            here we have the sole diligent female researcher connecting satanic Jewish plutocrat family after satanic Jewish plutocrat family, for like two years now.
           </p>
           <p>
            demonstrating how they conceive and fund all the art/cultural subversion, mind control, political blackmail, etc = all of PG.
           </p>
           <p>
            yet because decisiveness is not a trait god chose to give to women, she will never advance beyond this hobbyist-cataloguer-compiler phase to make real impact.
           </p>
           <p>
            Jews were removed en masse literally hundreds of times from our lands for much less perfidy and on far less evidence -- but that was before women had the political power to contradict the men trying to protect them.
           </p>
           <p>
            If I recall, the last time I asked her about this she said something noncommittal like "you do your thing, i'll do mine."
           </p>
           <p>
            which sounds like a dodge, because women are known to respond more to social pressure and she cant bear to be labeled a "Nazi."  courage is also not something that women would biologically evolve to possess.
           </p>
           <p>
            but I still have hope that one day she will see that all these tidbits inevitably lead to a single source -- the Jews -- which is of course logical given the hereditary and historically limited nature (the ancient Near East + Europe) and graduate to real activism in defense of our glorious but moribund race.
           </p>
           <p>
            for ex. in one link she mentions the cartoon Archer being James Bond "who was a spook": the Bond character is based on the father of British espionage

           </p>
           <p>
            But all occultism is ultimately from Jewish Kabbalah, just like the ideas that women are able to behave like men or that money can be conjured from nothing through systems of interest.

             Do you have a shitty neck beard? I'm assuming you do for two reasons: 1. You're a dirty muzzie, and 2. You probably think it disguises your double chin so you don't look as obsese as you really are! 😂🖕🏻

             So true, so profound! The influence of Jewish Kabbalah  is readily apparent in the  aboriginie  cultures  thruout the world.  Note the Eskimoes, Innuit, the hidden tribes of the Amazon,  the aboriginies of Australia,  the  countless and various groups of indigenous peoples originally inhabiting the South Pacific Islands.  Vestiges of ancient Jewish Kabbalah can even be detected amongst wolf packs in the Canadian wilderness and Penguin populations in Antartica. So widespread is the Jewish influence thanks in large part to Jewish females who despite being indecisive were far superior than males when it came to multi-tasking and were thus able to nurture a dozen or more offspring simultaneously.

            That photo of the Olsens and Hillary Clinton at The Child Mind Institute is awful. First, the institution logo says a fractured mind with different personalities for a child and that’s exactly what they study there. Next, look at the twins, Mary Kate in black as the devil twin, the one who is the skinny annorexic and Ashley in white as the angelic twin the one who is the prettier of the two. I believe they are always portrayed this way and purposely like the devil and the angel. As soon as they were out of their teens they looked this way, good and evil, darkness and light. Lastly, Hellary, the supreme grand dame witch in blue, it is as if she is well aware the twins are pawns and MK Ultra puppets for Hollywood blackmail and doing the dirty work for the agenda. It would certainly be interesting to know the real story of what really goes on in the CMI as it’s so obviously a place for MK Ultra programming of children and trauma, etc.

            A former townhouse of Felix Warburg's in Manhattan, New York City. Felix and Paul Warburg emigrated to the United States. Felix Warburg married Frieda Schiff, daughter of Jacob H. Schiff, a banker who grew up in Frankfurt. Schiff financed parts of the American rail system through his investment bank Kuhn Loeb. Schiff's great great grandson Drew married Al Gore's daughter Karenna.

            OMG.  Jacob H. Schiff - Is he related to Adam Schiff   I have been trying to find out if he is connected to this banker guy, but have not found it yet.

              A Jacob Schiff, this time arriving from Poland, came to New York in the early 1900's.  He was a cabinet maker who later made his home in New Haven.  His son Irwin was a prominent figure in the US tax protester movement.  He died in federal prison in 2015 while he was serving a 13 year sentence for tax evasion.  His son Peter, however, has been a successful financial investor and writer.  A Schiff family from Lithuania came to Boston in 1906 where the husband worked in the butcher's trade.  Their grandson Adam became a Californian Congressman in 2001.

              You are saying you don't think so.  Does that mean Adam is not related?  I remember reading he was.  Is this the same Jacob even though they don't include the H in his name.

              I would bet mother Vanderbilt sacrificed her son Cooper for the fame and life of her other son Anderson. It was in the cards from the beginning and planned considering their book The Rainbow Comes and Goes...

               I have been perusing the same notion - sacrifice of a child for the "success" of another or oneself.
              </p>
              <p>
               Look at the number of politicians who have lost children of all ages.  Famous people as well.  That being said, people DO lose children, so hard to say if it is a statistical anomaly.

               On the other hand, what are the odds that Biden's son, No Name, and T. Kennedy died of a cancer which only affects 3:100,000 per year?

               Sadly, I agree. Cooper was also the weaker of the two. Possibly she didn't like sensitive men and made the choice.  These are evil people.  They sell their children for wealth.  Also, this proves she didn't think they or Anderson were smart enough to make it on their  own.  She had to give up his brother to gain power.  Really sad.
