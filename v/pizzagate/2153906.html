<p>I\'ve gone back to watching TV series and with a different lenses i\'ve really enjoyed watching the HBO series OZ and now watching The Sopranos.  In OZ that is how HBO foreshadowed what we are seeing today.  It\'s based around a special wing in a prison where the most violent get more freedom.  The gangs/groups that formed are White(Nazis), Blacks(gangsters &amp; Africans), Muslims(mostly black, no spoiler), Jews(one is in prison for drugging men, raping them, then killing them &amp; another kills a prominent muslim giving a Zionist explanation as to why), trannies, White Irish, and Hispanics.</p>
<p>When a new inmate joins Emerald City he is forced to join his respective race or pay the consequences.  HBO portrays 99% of whites as Neo-Nazis who enjoy gay sex.  HBO portrays the gangsters/africans as drug pushers/users/thugs.  HBO portrays Muslims as peaceful and thinkers who try to rescue the Gangsters &amp; Africans and convert them because drugs and their hardships are the White man keeping them down(Not the jew, but the gentiles).  HBO does have jewish inmates, I can only remember two one is a gay lover of one of the main characters who is in prison for drugging, raping, and murdering young men.  The other Jew kills an important character because the World must be Balanced.

<p>Of course none of this works and there is constant violence observed, whenever someone tries to fix things someone else prevents it.</p>

<p>Now I am onto The Sopranos.  Season 1, Episode 9 Tony Soprano approaches a guy wearing a hat in a restaurant.  The guy replies to Tony then slowly turns his head, and BAM right in your face.</p>

            No mention of True Detective Detective season 1?  If you haven't seen it then you need to watch it now. By far the best tv series. Ever. It's got everything; pedo symbols, snuff movies, SRA, government corruption and the best performance of Matthew McConaughey's career. Once you start watching you can't stop.

             I feel like that purpose was to paint the criminals as bum white people instead of the suit and tie wearing cult that engages in these activities.  The Sherrif/govt coverup was well done.  You are right though Matthew and Woody were great, so much I didn't bother with season 2.
