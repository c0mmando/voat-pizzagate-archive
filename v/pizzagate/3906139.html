            Is Sotheby's providing safe houses for the CIA? Also in regard to the handkerchief with a map that seems pizza-related, I came across something a while ago. It seems that around the time this took place there was an individual (a designer of specialty hospitality items like menus and napkins) in Brooklyn NY (who has a website) that
           </p>
           <p>
            advertised a "handkerchief map invite." It was a custom-printed handkerchief that could be mailed, with a notice and directions to a special event like graduation, wedding, party, etc. Interesting is that this person's office in Brooklyn was in the same area as HRC's Brooklyn campaign headquarters. Did Podesta receive one of these "handkerchief map invites," from HRC's office and did pizza mean something other than a quite mundane pizza party?
