            <em>
             The prosecutors state:
            </em>
           </p>
           <p>
            “Campaign Contribution Evidence i. Facts At trial, the government intends to introduce witness testimony and documents demonstrating that
            <strong>
             in 2007, the defendants and their co-conspirators were involved in an illegal scheme to exceed contribution limits to a presidential primary campaign.
            </strong>
           </p>
           <p>
            Witness testimony, corroborated by documentary evidence, will demonstrate that
            <strong>
             at least 14 members of the Nxivm community, including at least five defendants and co-conspirators
            </strong>
            , made the maximum campaign donation to a primary campaign
            <strong>
             with the understanding that they would be reimbursed by Bronfman or Nancy Salzman
            </strong>
            .
           </p>
           <p>
            At the suggestion of a political operative, who has since pleaded guilty to an unrelated New York state bribery charge also involving campaign contributions, the contributions were “bundled” and presented to the candidate at a fundraising event attended by conspirators, including Nancy Salzman.
           </p>
           <p>
            A cooperating witness who attended the event will testify that the defendants and their co-conspirators made the contributions in hopes of obtaining political influence to advance their own agenda, including targeting perceived enemies of Raniere. The government will also seek to introduce evidence of similar conduit contributions to other elected officials, as well as use of other political lobbyists in attempts to gain influence.
           </p>
           <p>
            ii. Admissibility The defendants’ and co-conspirators’ involvement in the conduit contribution scheme and related acts described above, is direct evidence of the charged racketeering conspiracy. Their work together to commit crimes as part of a coordinated effort to curry political favor, evidenced in part by the records of maximum contributions by members of Nxivm on the same day, demonstrates the relationship of trust among the defendants and coconspirators, which is proof of the Enterprise’s existence.
           </p>
           <p>
            … The same evidence also demonstrates the nature of the criminal relationships between the defendants, which defendants are attempting to portray as a purely legitimate association. The evidence of the conduit contributions is also direct evidence of the existence of the Enterprise and the pattern of racketeering activity because it is probative of the defendant and co-conspirators’ “us[e of] harassment, coercion and abusive litigation to intimidate and attack perceived enemies and critics of RANIERE,” (Indictment ¶ 6(f)).
           </p>
           <p>
            Specifically, the bundled campaign contributions were part of an attempt to curry favor with a presidential nominee to advance the goals of the defendants and co-conspirators, including by
            <strong>
             obtaining indictments against enemies and gaining advantages in litigation.
            </strong>
           </p>
           <p>
            The evidence of the conduit contributions also demonstrates the relatedness of the predicate acts, because it demonstrates the attitude of defendants and co-conspirators that they must “cheat to win” to fight the conspiracy they believed was operating against them.
           </p>
           <p>
            … Moreover, the conduit contributions is also probative of motive and intent as to the DOS-related acts and charges, because the evidence at trial will demonstrate that
            <strong>
             one of the defendants and co-conspirators purposes in forming DOS was to have a pyramid of collateralized powerful women who he could order to do things for him or order to vote in a group to “turn elections.”
            </strong>
           </p>
           <p>
            Finally, because several cooperating witnesses are implicated in the campaign contribution scheme, such evidence is also admissible to corroborate their testimony and to front issues that are expected to be raised on cross-examination.”

            Have written this before but it bears repeating. Daily Kos is a democratic website owned by  Markos Moulitsas , formerly in the CIA. He and his website pushed anybody running for elected office who the clintons liked. Not a lot...but Kirsten Gillibrand was one of them. Joe Tester was another ...he has been mentioned as a pedophile.

            <p>
             One of the gems of information contained in Document 414 , that notable filing by prosecution, wherein they ask the judge to rule on admissibility of a raft of crimes and misdemeanors that that racketeering enterprise known as Nxivm allegedly engaged in, but were not charged for, is the following, and is found on page 24 of  the document. 
It alleges an illegal scheme to support a certain candidate for president of the USA.
While the prosecution does not name the candidate Nxivm allegedly illegally supported, Frank Report will identify her:  She is Hillary Rodham Clinton.
