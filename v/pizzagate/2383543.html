<p>There is so much in this resource that I haven\'t had a chance to read through.  The section on Rwanda really caught my attention and you can see why given the quote above.  Scroll the webpage to see the pictures and info.  I did a simple cut/paste with just the text:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>NOTICE: This timeline entry on Rwanda is longer than our normal entries due to an evident and concerted effort by MSM to push a false narrative on the public about who was really behind the merciless slaughter of 1 million innocent civilians. That narrative is evidently a false flag pretext created by a rogue C.I.A. on behalf of its globalist mining and eugenics interests. This entry attempts to straighten a very crooked record that shockingly winds back to Arkansas and the Clintons.</p>
<p>Rwandan &quot;Genocide:&quot; Central African rare earth minerals &amp; diamond sources for The Clinton Foundation, George Soros &amp; their computer technology globalist collaborators</p>
<p>John M. Deutch,
C.I.A. Director, pardoned by Clinton for illegal use of computer at home</p>
<p>Paul Kagame</p>
<blockquote>
<p>By Jul. 18, 1994, Paul Kagame took power in Rwanda after an alleged &quot;Rwandan Genocide.&quot; This massacre of almost 1 million Rwandans now appears to have been a C.I.A.-fabricated eugenics program that also served as a false flag pretext. This pretext provided the cover to seize control of rare earth minerals in the resource-rich neighboring Congo. Those minerals are critical for the manufacturing of computers, military surveillance devices, aerospace, defense, nuclear, satellites, mobile technology and TVs by the rogue C.I.A. Deep State shadow government &quot;Big Data&quot; spy operation globally.</p>
<p>Kagame had been head of military intelligence in the Ugandan Armed Forces after being trained by the C.I.A. at the U.S. Army Command and Staff College (CGSC) in Leavenworth, Kansas.Tellingly, the official &quot;Rwandan genocide&quot; mainstream media and Congressional narrative MAKES NO MENTION of Kagame\'s extensive C.I.A. training, much less any U.S. complicity.[660].</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Also missing from the official MSM narrative is the sworn testimony before Congress (May 2001) and in France (2002) by NSA military intelligence analyst Wayne Madsen who testified: &quot;A French military intelligence officer said he detected some 100 armed U.S. troops in the eastern Zaire conflict zone,&quot; Madsen\'s statement began: &quot;Moreover, the DGSE [French secret service] reported the Americans had knowledge of the extermination of Hutu refugees by Tutsis in both Rwanda and eastern Zaire and were doing nothing about it. More ominously, there was reason to believe that some U.S. forces, either Special Forces or mercenaries, may have actually participated in the extermination of Hutu refugees.&quot; (pp. 9-10).[658]</p>

              The official narrative is suspect and appears to have been a C.I.A. false flag pretext. NSA analyst Wayne Madsen concurs in his book abstract for Genocide and Covert Operations in Africa, 1993-1999 (Mellen Press, 1999): "The USA was not merely an innocent bystander to the events that led to the systematic mass killing of humans. It also introduces the world of international mining and the dubious nature of the network of investors and agents of influence that support the mining industry. It considers how the unlikely confluence of African, American, Southeast Asian and even Arkansas politics had tremendous consequences for many disparate players, including the Clinton administration, the Habyarimana regime in Rwanda, Marshal Mobutu of Zaire, and the peoples of Sierra Leone, Congo, and Angola."

             Hutus were 91.6% of the population. On Apr. 06, 1994, moderate Hutu President Juvénal Habyarimana's plane was shot down by two French-supplied Russian SAM-16 Gimlet missiles (captured in Iraq in Feb. 1991, Le Figaro) along with fellow Hutu passenger and Burundi President Cyprien Ntaryamira. Habyarimana's assassination is said to have ignited Hutu-Tutsi ethnic tensions in the region and a genocidal rampage against minority Tutsi. The facts support an opposite story.

             On Apr. 07, 1994, the next day, a well-funded and well-armed C.I.A. agent and Tutsi named Paul Kagame, who commanded the Rwanda Patriotic Front (RPF) replete with Ugandan mercenaries, said he would resume the civil war if the alleged Tutsi killings did not stop. The next day, he pressed the attack. According to the official narrative, some one million Tutsis were allegedly killed by genocide-incited Hutus angered by Habyarimana's plane crash—in less than three months! This narrative breaks down when one does the math . . . and also realizes that two million Hutus simultaneously fled to Zaire.

            </blockquote>
            <p>
             According to the officially-accepted U.S., U.N. and RPF (Kagame, Tutsi) narrative, 1,074,017 Tutsis were killed. However, the total population of Rwanda was 7,099,844. Tutsis comprised 8.4% or 596,387. Therefore, the RPF / U.N. / U.S. / Tutsi claim is twice the total number of Tutsis available to kill! A former RPF officer, Abdul Ruzibiza, testified that the RPF counted Hutu corpses as Tutsi corpses![657]
            </p>
            <p>
             Extensive testimony in the Beatrice Munyenyezi trial provides clear evidence that an elite 100-man U.S. force directed Kagame's RPF forces with the aim of depopulation and plunder of rare earth mining resources in neighboring Congo. Extensive satellite imagery proves that the U.S. Department of Defense, NRO (National Reconnaissance Office), DIA (Defense Intelligence Agency) and C.I.A. were fully aware of the slaughter of Hutus and did nothing to stop it. Further, the evidence shows that Kagame killed as many of his fellow Tutsis as he did Hutus, then blamed all the Tutsi deaths on the Hutus.[658]
            </p>
            <p>
             Why would two million Hutus flee into Zaire if they were about to annihilate Kagame's Tutsi minority as claimed? In the process, Kagame used the RPF and the genocide pretext to kill some 25-45,000 Hutus in Rwanda. Then, he pursued the two million

             refugees into Zaire where he killed 200,000 more, and in the process overthrew the government of Zaire.

             Three globalist culprits appear to predominate: The Clinton Foundation, George Soros and his Open Society Foundations, and Maurice Tempelsman. In 1992, George Soros had almost destroyed the UK Pound and netted $1 billion overnight which he used to found the Open Society Foundations.

             Maurice Tempelsman
            </p>
            <p>
             Belgian-born Maurice Tempelsman has a long and bloody history in Africa. When Congo’s first Premier, Patrice Lumumba, pledged to return diamond wealth back to the newly independent Congo in the early 60’s, Tempelsman, who began with De Beers in the 1950’s, helped engineer the coup d’etat that consolidated the dictatorship of 29 year-old Colonel Mobutu (Zaire/Congo), and the coup against Ghana’s Kwame Nkrumah; diamonds were at stake in each.
            </p>
            <p>
             Tempelsman has a long and dubious history with the C.I.A. In the 1960s Tempelsman hired as his business agent the CIA station chief in Kinshasa (Zaire/Congo), Larry Devlin, who helped put Mobutu in power and afterward served as his personal adviser. From March 3, 1977, Tempelsman briefly held the title of honorary consul general for the Congo/Mobutu in New York City. With such unfettered access to the Congo's rich mining resources in diamonds and rare earth minerals needed in high technology manufacturing, Tempelsman is clearly a go-to financier for the globalist New World Order plans.

Bush (R). Tempelsman also exploited ties with Anthony Lake, Clinton’s National Security adviser, who intervened at the U.S. Export-Import Bank on Tempelsman’s behalf.

             Yes. Great thread. Only more proof that The Clinton Cartels octopus like tentacles, along with Billy's Rhodes Scholar contacts and the UK govt, in conjunction with their mirrored child abuse extortion ring programs, have used the coming restructuring as an opportunity to line their pockets with the worlds natural resources before the fall. Unfortunately, obviously, regardless if WWIII really happens or not, they really aren't the brightest lightbulbs in the pack because damn, everybody knows they're corrupt. But then, too, quite a few people knew beforehand what a monster Hitler was too.
