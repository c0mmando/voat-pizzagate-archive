  'formattedContent' => '<p>This info is fresh as far as I know. I\'ve never seen it mentioned anywhere else so let me try and lay it out as succinctly as possible. </p>
<p>After reading PleadingtheYiff\'s <a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1593188">post</a> about Brock Pierce I went to the wayback machine to dig up his connection to Epstein and ask if Yiff knew anything about this. What\'s the connection you ask? He was at a science conference organised by Epstein back in 2010. Epstein is a patron of the sciences and seems to have a keen interest in the research that goes on across the sciences. </p>
<p>Anyway, that\'s irrelevant. What is relevant is that this site is one of <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20131222125545/http://www.jeffreyepsteinforum.com/p/our-websites.html">nine</a> different sites that Epstein was running before he closed all but one at the start of 2015. Now, of those sites it\'s the <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20131214125824/http://www.jeffreyepsteinfoundation.com/">foundation website</a> that had me intrigued. I noticed it had a login area for members and at the bottom of the page a newest members section with photos. I started running a reverse image search on the faces of these people. I got hits for a few of the individuals. Two were scientists. Another was a CEO of a pharma company. For the others I had no luck [if you can identify these individuals please do so and post below] </p>
<p>Now, take a look at this archived version from <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20140518014920/http://jeffreyepsteinfoundation.com/">May 2014</a>. See that face on the right? The fourth photo across? That man is an architect. His name is <a href="https://twitter.com/pemar61">Peter Marcinko</a>. As soon as I read the name alarm bells started going off. I couldn\'t believe it. Marcinko is the male form of Marcinkova. Why is that interesting? Nadia Marcinkova was the personal sex slave of Epstein who helped procure girls and would also abuse them with Epstein. I remembered reading something about Marcinkova on jezebel so went back to the <a href="http://jezebel.com/5603638/meet-the-modeling-agent-who-trafficked-underage-girls-for-sex">article</a>. It was a piece about Jean Luc Brunel, a pedo modelling agent and close friend of Epstein. It read:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Jeffrey Epstein, you will no doubt recall, is the man who thought ferrying Bill Clinton on his private jet, lawyering up with superstar Alan Dershowitz, and making frequent $100,000 donations to the Palm Beach Police Department would insulate him from prosecution for his various depravities. Which included, for the record: buying a 14-year-old Yugloslavian named Natalia Marcinkova from her parents in order to keep Marcinkova as his “sex slave”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Nice. When I first read this I had an image of rich pervert Epstein flying to the Balkans to find an impoverished family that would be willing to give up their daughter for money. The father and family would then never see their little girl again or have anything to do with Epstein. Wow, how wrong was I? Turns out the guy who sold his daughter to Epstein is a member of his foundation website in 2014 and he isn\'t poor either but a rather <a href="http://www.archima.sk/">notable architect</a> working in Slovakia. I can only assume they are still friends to this day.</p>
<p>Going back to jezebel for a moment, I wanted something a little more concrete as a source for this info about Marcinkova being a sex slave at 14 so dug up Concheta Sarnoff\'s <a href="http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2010/07/20/jeffrey-epstein-billionaire-pedophile-goes-free.html">piece</a> from the daily beast that is referenced in the article. Sarnoff is very knowledgable about this subject having written a book on Epstein and child sex trafficking that I\'ve yet to read. I actually remember her during the election popping up on infowars and talking about child abuse to Alex Jones. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCyOuetfUQU">It was interesting</a>. She writes the following:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Subsequent investigation by the FBI, reaching as far back as 2001, indentified roughly 40 victims, not counting Nadia Marcinkova, whom Epstein referred to  as his “Yugoslavian sex slave” because he had imported her from the Balkans at age 14. Now 24, Marcinkova became a member of the household and is alleged to have participated in the sexual contact with underage girls.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I still wanted further info about Marcinkova so I dug out this <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1508967-deposition-excerpts.html">document</a>, a compendium of deposition statements from players in the Epstein case. The problem is that these are excerpts [though some are actually complete statements, Kellen, Epstein, Visoski] You scroll to Nadia Marcinkova\'s deposition and it\'s one random page. Useless. Whether her deposition is publicly available I don\'t know. Anyway, I don\'t think it matters as information about her crops up in the other depositions. The issue is finding this shit. The pdf isn\'t searchable. What we need is ten or so voaters to read a part each and provide a summary of the information for everyone\'s convenience.</p>
<p>So that\'s where I\'ve got to. Incidentally, if you were asking yourself what kind of a relationship exists between a father and the daughter he sold at 14 to a billionaire pedophile who remains his friend. Well, it\'s not what you would expect. After looking at Marcinko\'s <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/archima">linkdin</a> account, Nadia is on there giving him recommendations on his list of skills. It truly is a strange world.</p>',

            Truth. The jews are at the center of this satanic pedophilia and also at the center of trump's administration. Trump is a pedophile friend of epstein just like arkansas bill clinton. Epstein is a jew, and trump is controlled by jews.

             I hate to say it, but when you consider that &lt;2% of the US is Jewish (even less world wide), how is it that so many Jews are involved with these pedo/occult groups?

            "Culture", as it has been referenced, refers to "being a pedophile".  The same way most homosexuals will say 'this is who and what I am.  It is not a choice" is the same way a pedophile believes they are "authorized" to do what they do. They believe themselves to be a persecuted minority group.  In the same way all the other victim groups perceived themselves.
           </p>
           <p>
            It is their mantra and they are at the root of everything which most of us seek to revert.  They are justified in their actions.  They have embraced a "religion", whether that of satanic ritual child abusing demons or a "God-Fearing", Boy Scout leading, anti-human-trafficking lawyer for Jesus.
           </p>
           <p>
            They fully perceive themselves as the witches of Salem did.  Maybe the Pilgrims were onto something...

            I don't think Epstein's interest in the sciences is entirely irrelevant.....the sciences are very corrupt, the science aspect intertwined at the highest levels. Notice here in these tapes inside high level masonic initiation ceremonies.....they pray for the "light of scientific truth".  Am thinking this is higher up the flag pole than epstein or alephantic....more like Walt Disney/Albert Pike level.  Its the highest levels that ultimately provide all the intricate cover.  Even their lower members are sworn to secrecy and blood oath allegiance, their livelihood and security comes from their membership.  Not saying this is the full extent of the pizzagate thing, but the "science" aspect is further up the flag pole and been around hundreds of years.  If you read Pike's book, he was a satanist.....that's not to say all Masons are.....but at the highest levels they switch from worshiping God, to worshiping "the light and truth of science"....when you take a close look at some of their science....it really is dark arts, perpetrated deceptions on a grand scale.  Anyways, I think this ceremony was in Turkey, as has been noticed....this is worldwide and monolithic. To quote Kennedy "A monolithic and ruthless conspiracy".

            Yes! This is something I am VERY interested in, sociopathic/psychopathic power in society and how this relatively rare aberration of the human personality has managed to work its way into positions that have considerable influence on the rest of the species and how catastrophic that could be. I wrote a really long comment the other day about it, and how they think they're superior or the next stage in human evolution or something, when really they represent an evolutionary dead end.https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1595238/7800271
           </p>
           <p>
            When you think about it and realise how many things would be so much better and happier if it weren't for them...it's incredibly sad, and rage inducing.

             I'm with you on this. It's almost like an alien species that are working on a different plane to us and are hyper-intelligent. The way they've managed to pull this off for years while fooling us all.

            Great research.. a look at marcinko(global girl) Instagram show her close ties with her family. you can find an image of her with the vickers race car (Sarah kellen is now Sarah vickers-- wife of race car driver Brian bickers)... staying in touch after all those years.

            Really great job laying it out! It's so helpful when OP's take everyone through their search so that the dots are more easily connected. The swamp is deep and filthy. I do have faith though that we are on the verge of a big "awakening", if you will. Too many signs pointing to people being red pilled. This investigation alone is a great example.

            Wow, nice one. The father is probably part of it all, he'd probably been abusing her and taking her to weird rituals since she was little and finally made a deal of some kind for Epstein to take her. She has most likely grown up with this and knows nothing else. Many of the victims who have spoken out about what these people do and how they operate explain that as well as having victims that they just abuse and torture or murder etc, they also have victims, often their own children and children of other people in their group, who they basically groom to eventually take part in abusing others and they grow up to basically become totally indoctrinated, part of the whole thing and take over when the older generation dies off. That's how and why it keeps going, and how and why they've managed over a long time to get themselves into powerful positions. All of them do this because they had it done to them as children, and they are messed up and they think it's normal and right, and just their secret special 'culture' or whatever.
           </p>
           <p>
            So I expect that is why Nadia now takes part in abusing other young girls, and why she acts normal and friendly with her father.

             I love the reference to "culture" given JA kept repeating "your culture" to Ryan after he contacted him on FuckFacebook.
            </p>
            <p>
             The word culture can mean many things. In the context of his statement, we can determine what he was referring to is our ( those who believe human trafficking and/or abuse is reprehensible) way of life. That we, as a society, believe it is wrong to abuse children.
            </p>
            <p>
             According to the Cambridge English Dictionary, "culture" is defined as: "the way of life of a particular people, esp. as shown in their ordinary behavior and habits, their attitudes toward each other, and their moral and religious beliefs."
            </p>
            <p>
             He is saying what we believe in is contrary to what he believes in. We, in his dialogue, can be none other than PG'ers. We believe any type of abuse to another human being is wrong but find it absolutely reprehensible when it impacts an innocent child. By saying "it's your culture", he is distancing himself from us and what we believe. The only logical deduction is that he doesn't believe what we believe to be wrong is actually wrong and that he incriminate himself.

              Yes it implies that they think that because different cultures have different practices, beliefs, attitudes and moral codes, that there are no moral absolutes, what your culture thinks is wrong, mine thinks is right etc and vice versa. That there's no objective stand alone judgement to provide a definitive answer either way, it's just a matter of 'preferences' or socially constructed rules that have no meaning independent of the people that created them and live by them. So perhaps they use this argument to rationalise and justify what they do - I expect they are all so messed up and neurologically scrambled that they genuinely don't understand the way it feels to a real, whole, human being when they know something is wrong. They can't imagine being in the shoes of a child that is suffering, they can't feel for or on behalf of them in that way, and they can't therefore understand on the most important and most fundamental level why it is abhorrent. I'm sure there must be some cure out there for that horrific lack of empathy, waiting to be discovered. I really hope so!

             I know how you feel. I am learning a lot. But it's not what is needed once someone has put together this much. Read things carefully. You never know when you will connect something or add a missing link. Much of this comes from people who just 'happen to remember' a particular article, book, movie, song, tv interview...there is so much. Keep caring. That means a lot.
