<p>Their names have been carefully chosen to <em>imply</em> government status (notice the use of the words <em>Federal</em> and <em>National</em>) but, just like the Federal Reserve, <strong>the NCMEC is a private corporation that has been appointed to perform certain functions that would usually be in the purview of a government agency.</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://www.childlaw.us/protect_ncmec/">http://www.childlaw.us/protect_ncmec/</a></p>
<p>Another misconception most people have is that the NCMEC takes any role in the recovery of missing children or stopping child exploitation and abuse. They don\'t.</p>
<p><a href="https://scottbernstein.me/2014/03/06/ncmec-are-fat-cats-that-will-not-investigate-your-missing-child/">https://scottbernstein.me/2014/03/06/ncmec-are-fat-cats-that-will-not-investigate-your-missing-child/</a></p>
<p>And here\'s the kicker: The NCMEC has a $50,000,000 per year budget, but they pay $30,000,000 of that out in salaries, to people who don\'t do anything, other than put information on a website, lobby congress, and pass information on to other, real government agencies.</p>
<p>That\'s right: <strong>60% of NCMEC\'s budget is paid to insiders as salaries. Including more than $1,000,000 paid annually to its CEO:</strong></p>
<p>This was reported in detail in an article in the Tampa Bay Times:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.tampabay.com/news/publicsafety/quasi-governmental-missing-kids-center-enjoys-key-exemptions-from-federal/1067463">http://www.tampabay.com/news/publicsafety/quasi-governmental-missing-kids-center-enjoys-key-exemptions-from-federal/1067463</a></p>
<p>but you\'ll just get a &quot;not available&quot; message if you try that link. The article triggered a furious reaction from the NCMEC and its lawyers and the article was taken down shortly afterwards. Fortunately for us, somebody had the forsight to archive it, and you can read the sordid details on NCMEC here:</p>
<p><a href="https://archive.is/hUi2P">https://archive.is/hUi2P</a></p>
<p>So $30,000,000 of the NCMEC\'s budget comes from the federal government, through the Justice Department. That means that if you\'re an American, your tax dollars paid $600,000 of CEO Ernie Allen\'s salary back in 2008 (what the new CEO is being paid in 2017 has not been released to the public, but it is surely even more.)</p>
<p>This, for a guy who\'s only function was to appear at conferences, make appearances before Congress, and lobby for continued funding. The last function is probably why he was getting paid what he did. His <strong>real</strong> function was to make sure NCMEC stayed securely attached to the government funding teat.</p>
<p>So, we\'ve established that NCMEC doesn\'t actually do anything &quot;real,&quot; apart from operating a website, houcing a bunch of federal agents on it\'s property, and passing information on to them that, should arguably, have been passed directly to them without a middleman.</p>
<p>This agency looks like a parasite. It seems to have no other function than to scam the public to enrich a bunch of eltite insiders.</p>
<p>But we know that\'s never true with elite scams. There\'s always some <strong>real</strong> purposes for these private interlopers, and it\'s obvious what it is for NCMEC:</p>
<p><strong>The basic function of NCMEC is to provide an &quot;insulating layer&quot; between &quot;federally sanctioned&quot; pedophilia (&quot;protected elite pedophiles,&quot; as well as pedophilia exploited by intelligence agencies) and the public.</strong></p>
<p>1) Since NCMEC is not a legally a government entity, it does not have to respond to FOIA requests (there is no way to use FOIA to pry information out of NCMEC, this is perfect for elites who want to be immune from information disclosure requirements.)</p>
<p>2) NCMEC provides the perfect &quot;Man-In-The_Middle&quot; to filter information that gets passed on to federal agents and prosecutors who are responsible for the <strong>actual work</strong> of combatting pedophilia, the grunt work of investigating, arresting and prosecuting pedophiles. Information of &quot;small-fry&quot; regular pedophiles gets passed on, but pedophilia operations of intelligence agencies and insider elites, get buried, with no information disclosure requirements.</p>
<p>And here\'s a very relevant article about how Big Data corporations are getting in on the scam, and how the elites are behind this trend too:</p>

            Exactly!! This is how the evil plays the game. They are only in place to control anything about child abuse being revealed. Sadly, one day yuo will see that even Amnesty International is nothing but clucks. I know first hand because I used to be friends with Jack Healey, who was the director. Dirty dirty dirty

            <p>
             Many people assume the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children (NCMEC) is a government agency, just like they assume the Federal Reserve that sets monetary policy is a government agency. It's not!
            </p>
           </blockquote>
           <p>
            They are corporations created by the government like Amtrak, the Resolution Trust or the Partnership for Drug-Free Kids.  NCMEC is a non profit.
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             Another misconception most people have is that the NCMEC takes any role in the recovery of missing children or stopping child exploitation and abuse. They don't.
            </p>
           </blockquote>
           <p>
            This is just silly.  Nobody is expecting the NCMEC to be a law enforcement agency, but it's also straight up false to say they take no role in recovery of missing children is false.  To say they just operate a website is false as well. OP is not even dealing with all the things NCMEC says they do on their website.  Here are some of the things that the OP ignores.

           <p>
            <a href="http://www.missingkids.com/ourwork/teamadam">
             They work directly with Law Enforcement.
            </a>
            They do
            <a href="http://www.missingkids.org/theissues/longtermmissing">
             forensic face modeling for long term missing kids
            </a>
            .
           </p>
           <p>
            They
            <a href="https://report.cybertip.org/">
             operate a tip line
            </a>
            ,
           </p>
           <p>
            They
            <a href="http://www.missingkids.com/ourwork/bestpractices">
             train law enforcement
            </a>
            , etc.
           </p>
           <p>
            However they also provide other services like
            <a href="http://www.missingkids.com/ourwork/support">
             counseling to both victims and to their families.
            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            And their website has lots of materials on education, training, best practices, analysis etc.  That requires expertise.  Where do you think all this material comes from?  The web folks surely are not doing that.

             Yeah?  Show us where on NCMEC's website they show what children they've saved?  For 50,000,000 bucks per year.  They talk about all of the initiatives and money they've spent.

             There is nothing to indicate they have saved a single child.

              , Engaging this person just provides them what they want, which is attention. He or she seems to be a real person and not a bot, so I'm guessing some kind of ODC is involved? Anyways, (s)he is not interested in the point of this thread, or much of anything else to do with elite pedophilia.
