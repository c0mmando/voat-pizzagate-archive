<hr />
<p><a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/2218774">My Day 2 submission</a> focused on David Brock\'s Media Matters organization. It pointed to two flows of illegally diverted cash, either of which could pay for the social media disinfo operation run by HLI.</p>
<p>Day 2 didn\'t get so many viewers, probably because &quot;money trail&quot; makes people\'s eyes glaze over. This is similarly detail-oriented, but it shows so much about the true nature of Pizzagate that I urge you to invest the time. <strong>Planning for a cover-up began in late 2013, and active disinfo began in early 2014</strong>. This was long before the DNC email leak in July 2016, or the Podesta email leak in Oct 2016. <strong>It is vital to figure out what the original cover-up was about.</strong> (I sketched out my theory that it was about the Glenn Beck whistleblower incident <a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/2218774">here</a>. More on that coming soon.)</p>
<p>As I explained earlier, the \'worker bees\' at MM are unaware of any criminal side to the organization. HLI doesn\'t have a cubicle in the corner; he works offsite, and the funds for his work are buried in a footnote, hidden from the IRS, and so on.</p>
<p>But hiding the money is trickier than just giving one number to the IRS and another in the annual report. In <a href="http://dailycaller.com/2012/02/17/left-wing-foundations-lavish-millions-on-media-matters/">this Daily Caller article</a>, you\'ll see that most of Media Matters\' funding comes from foundations, like $4.3 million from the Tides Foundation. Much of it is earmarked for specific projects: a regional office in Colorado, or hitting conservatives on immigration and gay marriage. Foundation money must be publicly disclosed by the foundation, even if not by MM. These earmarks and reporting rules limit MM from mischief. Totals must balance. Otherwise various normie worker bees would realize something wasn\'t right.</p>
<p>So the cash for the disinfo project must come from <em>individual</em> donors who don\'t earmark, and don\'t care about receipts. This behavior by itself hardly proves that any given donor is a pedosadist. He/she could just be someone who doesn\'t have their own personal charity foundation. But this part of Brock\'s money flow contains the shady bit.</p>
<p>Media Matters does not publish any information about its funding, so we fall back on two sources. Foundation reports were the basis for the Daily Caller research. Our second source is the Wikileaks Podesta emails. Last year, <a href="http://freebeacon.com/politics/hacked-emails-reveal-hundreds-donors-cap-media-matters/">Lachlan Markay of the <em>Washington Free Beacon</em> went through them</a> and found names and amounts for 89 individual donors to MM. One really stands out: Herb Sandler, who gave $100,000+. This was on top of the $400,000 that Sandler\'s foundation gave to Media Matters years earlier.</p>
<p>Why does Herb Sandler stand out? First look at <a href="https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/32795">email #32795 from the Wikileaks dump</a>, the &quot;handkerchief&quot; email. Written on September 2, 2014, originally it went from the Martha\'s Vineyard realtor, Kathryn Tate, to Herb and Susan Sandler, asking about a handkerchief. Then (perhaps after a phone call with Tate) <strong>Susan Sandler forwarded the email to John Podesta, creating the most famous phrase in Pizzagate lore, the &quot;pizza-related map&quot;</strong>.</p>
<p>By the way, my guess is that the house-viewing tour was simply that, and Kathryn Tate is a normie who was excited to be showing houses to powerful Democrats. During the tour, Podesta accidentally dropped his handkerchief, a memento of some icky event that took place hours or days earlier. While Tate didn\'t know its significance (calling it just a &quot;handkerchief&quot;), Sandler did, so she asked Podesta about it.</p>
<p>Now look at <a href="https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/4447">email #4447</a>, dated March 18, 2014, six months <em>before</em> the handkerchief incident. David Brock is catching up with Herb Sandler, after many years, to ask for more money.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It sure has been a long time since we have spoken and I was hoping that we could catch up for a few minutes when I am out in the Bay Area April 2-4. I have started a new project that is focused on defending Hillary Clinton from the myriad Right-wing attacks she is facing today.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The top part of #4447, redirecting from Herb Sandler to Podesta, is important too. Sandler\'s foundation has given upwards of $7 million to Podesta\'s Center for American Progress, and the Podesta emails show them discussing random subjects, like Thomas Piketty\'s bestseller <em>Capital</em>, typically every few weeks. So, before meeting with Brock, he tries to check in with Podesta. The implicit question here is: Do you endorse Brock\'s plan? Should I meet with him?</p>
<p>Podesta doesn\'t answer right away, so Sandler <a href="https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/58175">emails again two days later in #58175</a>, saying he wants &quot;advice&quot;. Evidently they couldn\'t deal with everything on the phone, because then on the 31st, Podesta is in San Francisco, and <a href="https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/1721">in #1721 he gets directions to a dinner with Sandler</a> in Russian Hill. Then right after that, David Brock arrives in San Francisco for his April 2-4 visit, and with Podesta\'s endorsement, he gets the money for the disinfo operation.</p>
<p>At around this time, Brock launched Correct The Record, which fits the description he gave in the initial email. He and Sandler likely did discuss CTR when they met, along with the disinfo project, because Sandler later donated $3 million to two Brock-related super PACs, Priorities USA Action and American Bridge, which in turn gave CTR at least $1 million. But this $100,000+ was given by Sandler <strong>specifically to Media Matters</strong>. It did not go to either of these super PACs. (Plus CTR has now shut down, yet the disinfo operation continues.) Again, it was <strong>personal, not foundation money</strong>, so without Wikileaks we would have no way to know about it. It is thus ideal for diversion to a slush fund, and the handkerchief email is our evidence that Sandler and his wife are possible pedosadists willing to pay for a disinfo operation.</p>
<p>Exploring Brock\'s finances has side benefits. These dates check out with the &quot;Tory Smith&quot; YouTube project. The most frequent commenter on Tory Smith\'s channel is &quot;Lisa Brown,&quot; another HLI sockpuppet who talks about Cargill and Monsanto like WIC did. Both YouTube accounts were created in October 2013. This tells us roughly when Brock began planning the disinfo project. But YouTube shows no activity on Brown\'s channel until late April 2014 -- <strong>after funding had been secured</strong>. Likewise with Smith\'s now-deleted blog; the Wayback Machine shows no entries before March 2014. (Smith deleted his older YouTube videos, and the Wayback Machine did not save anything from that period, so that activity is unclear.)</p>
<p>This brings us to <a href="https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/55494">email #55494</a>, dated Feb 10, 2015. Now, Sandler is having some concern whether the volatile paranoid that he gave the money to, is really up to the task. </p>
<p>It helps to read <a href="https://www.politico.com/story/2015/02/david-brock-resigns-priorities-usa-action-115028">the <em>Politico</em> article that Sandler linked to</a>, but I will summarize: various Democrats have complained about Brock (and Podesta\'s) partner, the Bonner Group, charging an enormous (12.5 %) fundraising fee. Nobody else charges such a high fee. Lots of Democrat money is raised without fees at all. Brock protests that he is being smeared, and resigns from the board of Priorities USA Action. To Sandler, Podesta basically shrugs and says &quot;crazy is as crazy does&quot;.</p>
<p>This email has led people to conclude that John Podesta doesn\'t like David Brock. But that\'s superficial. (They\'re all child-raping sociopaths, after all.) We get deeper insight when we recall that funds for Media Matters passed through a maze of 14 front organizations, most of which paid the 12.5 % to Bonner. Depending what path the money took, Bonner could double- or triple-dip, collecting 23.5 % or 33.0 %, and then kick back a big chunk to Brock. Even at 12.5 % Brock\'s scheme was/is a ripoff by the usual standards in politics, but if the full truth became widely known, Brock would be a pariah among Democrats. So he resigned, to push that story out of the news fast. </p>
<p>We don\'t know all the details of Bonner\'s deal with Podesta. And we can\'t say for sure if Podesta knew, back in 2015, that Brock was scheming with Bonner to skim to this degree. But if he did know, he clearly didn\'t tell Sandler, and Brock didn\'t either. Otherwise Sandler would not have needed the <em>Politico</em> article explained to him, and Podesta would not have chosen this non-explanation as a reply. </p>
<p>This is what I mean about the Clinton gang having no discipline. Remember how Brock\'s other gay lover blackmailed him? These guys are too busy lying or stabbing one another in the back to do anything properly.</p>
<p>So. This is the actual guy funding David Brock to pay HLI/&quot;Tory Smith&quot; to come to <a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzagate">/v/pizzagate</a> every day. Welcome to Voat, Herb!</p>
<p>One minor goal of my reports has been to get bad-tempered Brock to scream at HLI/&quot;Tory Smith&quot;. Now I have a new goal: To get Herb Sandler to scream at John Podesta, who screams at David Brock, who takes out his frustration on HLI/&quot;Tory Smith&quot;. It\'s more sh*t going down a bigger hill, or so I hope.</p>

           <a href="https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/32795">
            email #32795 from the Wikileaks dump

           , the "handkerchief" email. Written on September 2, 2014, originally it went from the Martha's Vineyard realtor, Kathryn Tate, to Herb and Susan Sandler, asking about a handkerchief. Then (perhaps after a phone call with Tate)
           <strong>
            Susan Sandler forwarded the email to John Podesta, creating the most famous phrase in Pizzagate lore, the "pizza-related map"

So he resigned, to push that story out of the news fast.
          </p>
          <p>
           We don't know all the details of Bonner's deal with Podesta. And we can't say for sure if Podesta knew, back in 2015, that Brock was scheming with Bonner to skim to this degree. But if he did know, he clearly didn't tell Sandler, and Brock didn't either. Otherwise Sandler would not have needed the
           <em>
            Politico
           </em>
           article explained to him, and Podesta would not have chosen this non-explanation as a reply.
          </p>
          <p>
           This is what I mean about the Clinton gang having no discipline. Remember how Brock's other gay lover blackmailed him? These guys are too busy lying or stabbing one another in the back to do anything properly.
          </p>
          <p>
           So. This is the actual guy funding David Brock to pay HLI/"Tory Smith" to come to
           <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/v/pizzagate">
            /v/pizzagate
           </a>
           every day. Welcome to Voat, Herb!
          </p>
          <p>
           One minor goal of my reports has been to get bad-tempered Brock to scream at HLI/"Tory Smith". Now I have a new goal: To get Herb Sandler to scream at John Podesta, who screams at David Brock, who takes out his frustration on HLI/"Tory Smith". It's more sh*t going down a bigger hill, or so I hope.

            It's good to finally be able to provide some insight to others in this subvoat. I reached out to the OP with a request to communicate. Some of his analysis was interesting enough to want more.
           </p>
           <p>
            He immediately accused me of being HLI and began insulting me. Sooo, I responded with my name, rank and serial number as well as my cell # and told him to call anytime. He responded with more of the save.
           </p>
           <p>
            What did I learn from the experience? Obviously HLI would be unable to expose himself to complete identity verification, which I did. So unless the OP is stupid he knows that. His persistence at repulsion to communicating with me is likely strategic, and obviously deceptive. There are a few possibilities here, none of them good. Take your pick. I've chosen to suspect that he's just a Net celebrity; not a spook or paid influence peddler. But not all that intent on fixing Pizzagate or anything.
           </p>
           <p>
            Anyone who knows me or my group, IMS knows we don't like to waste time. That includes getting into flame wars. When a project or relationship goes sour, we're our. So, I'm out of whatever OP is doing. Just thought others would be curious.

             Dude. If you were deliberately trying to boost my credibility, and show just how desperate HLI is getting, you couldn't do anything better than this. Everyone on this forum understands that you don't Skype or have phone conversations with total frickin' strangers, and that
             <strong>
              it is very impolite even to ask
             </strong>
             . I don't
             <em>
              care
             </em>
             who you are, or who you claim to be. You could be Walter Cronkite or Mahatma Gandhi, you're still not getting my phone number.
            </p>
            <p>
             As I told you in my message, you don't roleplay a normal person very well. You just go right to the creepy and inappropriate stuff.

              Cronkite and Ghandi were both tentacles of power. But I'm sure you're expertise goes far beyond Pizzagate related talking points. Hmm.

              So I ask you again, how DOES a normal person contact you about collaborating with a much larger group? I'm curious because I do this work full time and I've been described as many things, but never creepy. OH wait. Even asking this is impolite too, correct?

                made it clear early on in this series

               that I don't have collaborators, and that for security reasons I work entirely through Voat and avoid other platforms. Did you not read that?
              </p>
              <p>
               Want to know one of the most phony and creepy aspects of your contacts so far? You claim to be interested in my work, but you have yet to name anything specific that you liked, or any reason why I would need to respond. Your "much larger group" is known first and foremost as Sandy Hook truthers. What does that have to do with my project? Why would I want to collaborate with you? Why would you want to collaborate with me? In your first message, the closest you came to an answer was saying this:
              </p>
              <blockquote>
               <p>
                I think coming together to execute a simple, phased plan will achieve our key goals.
               </p>
              </blockquote>
              <p>
               In my reply I mocked this as pathetic, because it is. What goals? When did they become "our" goals? And why in God's name would I start by placing my safety in your hands, before I even knew what the goals were?
              </p>
              <p>
               The entire purpose of your message was a futile and poorly executed attempt to dox me. Period

                Not one word of what I've said is a lie. But fair enough. You don't wish to work with others. Isn't that all you needed to say? It would have saved you from accusing me of being HLI.and now of attempting to dox you. And did you miss when I said I didn't want to waste your time and respected your privacy?
               </p>
               <p>
                I'd be happy to message you what I sent to my group with specific references to your analysis.

               <p>
                My point is, there's no way in hell you'd be approved for membership  in our group at this point, but I'd prefer you and others understood what really just happened.

            Do you gus think these people changed their email address? Perhaps send some disinfo emails to pedo Herb pretending to be reliable sources** arguing against his better judgements. **(look at emails where he's CC'd and pretend to be one of those random CC people, and change the L to a capital i somewhere if possible)

            , when you say planning for a cover-up began in 2013, what do you think they were covering up? Was this a run-up to the election, or to control the narrative regarding things like Benghazi?

             There's a huge context for events in 2013 that I haven't written anything about as yet. These things take a lot of time to compose, and I've mostly had to stick with micro details so far. I'll take a brief stab here at setting that context.
            </p>
            <p>
             I think that the biggest problem the pedosadists were facing in 2013 was that their machine was aging and falling apart. That's still their problem, only now made far worse by Trump. Partly this is because of the Clintons, partly it's just the passage of time.
            </p>
            <p>
             When Bush Sr. rose to power, he did it over decades, with a lot of care and self-discipline. He was already rich, and had all the right connections. He put in his time as director of the CIA, and VP to Reagan. But to keep things stable from one election cycle to the next, he needed to partner with some Democrats. I guess because they were already working with the CIA in Mena, and he already knew they were pedosadists, he chose the Clintons. By comparison, though, they were strung-out hillbilly carpetbaggers with no contacts, no family wealth, and zero self-discipline. Bill was expelled from his Rhodes scholarship at Oxford for raping a girl. That set the pattern; they would just take stuff, and do stuff, and leave it to someone else to cover for them. Like pardoning Marc Rich, or Hillary taking $200,000 in furniture from the White House. Or firing William Sessions as director of the FBI, and killing Vince Foster
             <em>
              the very next day
             </em>
             .
            </p>
            <p>
             Bush Jr. was nowhere near the equal of his father, but he had a bunch of old-guard guys in his administration who helped him keep everything more or less together for the crime syndicate. Now, clearly the plan was for Hillary to follow Bush Jr., but she was nowhere near the equal of Bill in politics. Riding a wave of mistrust, Obama grabbed the presidency. The result was 8 years of divided government like America had rarely seen before. Obama didn't even bother trying to line up Congressional support, because he wasn't going to get it. He just issued executive orders. He was trying to make peace with Iran, and the price of that would have been to let Assad stay, and to let the Shiites control the pipeline that would be built through Syria. But the compromise that was forced on Obama was that he had to take Hillary as Secretary of State for the first term. She ran around frantically making deals, selling uranium to Putin, selling foreign policy to the Saudis, ripping off Haiti, and so on, much as if she was president.
            </p>
            <p>
             And of course, during this same period we had the 2008 financial crisis, and the Tea Party, and the collapse of the Democrats at the state level, and the Berniecrats. Both parties were in bad shape in terms of credibility or power. Both were facing internal revolt.
            </p>
            <p>
             It's not clear to me whether Hillary intended to stay for Obama's second term, and then her health problems plus Benghazi forced her out, or if she always intended to leave after 2012, to prepare to run in 2016.
             <strong>
              Either way, the situation in February 2013, after her last day in office, was that the pedosadists were at their weakest and most vulnerable since about the mid-1970s.
             </strong>
             People all over the world, and in domestic politics, knew that the Bush-Clinton crime syndicate was running out of gas. For the first time in 32 years, they didn't have any key federal positions. Obama was corrupt, sure, but he wasn't running the global child-sex auction. He wasn't exposed in the same way as the Clintons. And who knew what would happen in 2016? Clearly, Chelsea or Jeb weren't going to just walk in and carry on.

             It was in this context that Snowden made his big 'reveal' in early June.
             <strong>
              I think there were a number of people who saw the global reaction to Snowden and said, 'Now or never,' and put together a plan to bring the machine down, as I described in

            </p>
            <p>
             There are a lot of nuances to the Glenn Beck video that I haven't gotten to yet. They will be the subject of my next big submission. But just to jump ahead a bit and mention one: Pence and especially Ryan are Tea Party sympathizers. On the face of it, neither of them owe much if anything to the old GOP establishment -- not even the usual political debts of party fundraising. According to Wikipedia, Ryan has brought in less pork for his district than other Republicans, as a matter of Tea Party principle. Beck is likewise way closer to the Tea Party than to old-money Republicans, and of course all three owe nothing at all to the Democrats or the Clintons. We can be skeptical about this and say they're still crooks, all politicians are crooks, and we don't trust them, sure. But while bringing down the old order would wreck lots of people in the GOP, and would wreck lots of Democrats, it seems clear that it would only advance their careers, as well as those of other Tea Party newcomers. They would have been heroes to a lot of red-state voters.
            </p>
            <p>
             I'm open to the argument that the Tea Party also auctions kids for ritual sacrifice. But someone has to provide
             <strong>
              some sort of actual evidence
             </strong>
             for that. It's kind of like the media saying that Trump voters are violent racist thugs, but somehow never having actual video of them beating black people. Instead all the video is of them waiting patiently in mile-long lineups, in the rain and cold, to cheer for Trump.
            </p>
            <p>
             I'm not buying the line that WIC and his sockpuppets keep putting out, that everyone is automatically blackmailed. If you believe that, then you have the burden of explaining why the government keeps shutting down over budget gridlock, and why there even
             <em>
              is
             </em>
             a Tea Party, and why Bernie was allowed to run, and countless other questions. Their control has never been that good. For a long time it has been barely good enough, and now it isn't even barely good enough.

              It doesn't shut down, The social security checks keep right on rolling. Its a dog and pony show to make it look like there isn't enough money when the truth is that trillions in hard assets have been taken over and replaced with debt.

            You are full of shit. AGAIN. You ran a sensational headline with a mishmash of old information that has been dug over a thousand times. With a mishmash of your HLI and Tory Smith disino.
           </p>
           <p>
            And you did every bit of this discombobulated shit just to take a whack at Wisconsin Is Corrupt because you are desperate to protect Paul Ryan because Racine is his district. This was your sole reason for showing up here with your lame drivel. The third sentence of your lame attempt went straight for Wisconsin Is Corrupt in an effort to tie him to your BS.
           </p>
           <p>
            Then you go on and on about old hat we dug through a thousand times. Finally pick up HLI again at the end and don't tie anything to anything.
           </p>
           <p>
            The thing that makes your schtick so transparent is the fact that you have no way to tie Wisconsin Is Corrupt to your crazy story so you just have to throw his name in there and hope that somehow it sticks.
           </p>
           <p>
            All you are doing is drawing more attention to Racine and people won't forget these attempts. You stay far, far, far away from the details of Racine when you do this because you are trying to figure out a way to discretit Wisconsin Is Corrupt without having to discuss Racine itself.

            You better be careful or you are going to piss people off and get a major dig going on this subject. You are lucky you have not triggred one already. You are fooling with a crowd of experts and they see what you are doing. If you get this hive stirred up they will turn Racine's business upside down and there will be very little left untouched.

             Oh Lord. This is what you're going with? I already volunteered to support this effort, provided anyone ever bothers to make it. In my rebuttal I posted a list of 67 random "leads" that WIC posted over a four-day period. To WIC, supplying a lead consists of declaring, like a divine oracle, that "Kabbalah is involved," or "the Club of Rome is involved," without any specific allegations of wrongdoing. An investigation of that random pile of names isn't going to get very far, no matter how many people turn out. But I doubt many will. WIC's own defense by this point is numbingly repetitive, as this quote from the link above shows:
            </p>
            <blockquote>
             <p>
              The RICO cases involved all of these people and many more. The entry point was based on extreme racial discrimination and segregation but that was only the tip of what was involved and it led to many foundations and secret societies including the Clinton Foundation.
             </p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>
             I already posted the link to the original civil RICO case, showing that it involved a few tavern owners and was properly dismissed. WIC keeps asserting that he knows all about a secret criminal RICO case, including that Paul Ryan obstructed it. This is unresponsive. Saying "many secret societies were involved" is insultingly stupid at this point. WIC cannot just claim, "I know things that nobody else knows, accept them on my authority as the Truth or you will never be Saved."

            Thanks for laying this out so cogently and well. I always wondered why the Podestas and Sandlers were so cozy, and this makes perfect sense.

            I believe Susan Sandler is Herb's daughter. She's married to Steve Phillips.
           </p>
           <p>
            From Steve Phillips' Wikipedia page:
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             Steve Phillips is a New York Times bestselling author, national liberal political leader, civil rights lawyer, and a senior fellow at the Center for American Progress. Phillips is founder and chairman of PowerPac+. He is also founder of PowerPAC.org. Phillips currently splits his time between San Francisco and Washington, D.C.

             No, only certain financial strings. Podesta is the chief of staff for the Clinton machine -- the
             <em>
              consigliere
             </em>
             if you remember the
             <em>
              Godfather
             </em>
             movies. He's the guy ordering killings, setting up major blackmail or extortion, and so on. Podesta has a large money machine, the Center for American Progress, which is mostly funded by normie Democrats. He also has consulting contracts with the Saudis and the Russians, and a lot of other stuff.
            </p>
            <p>
             Meanwhile Brock is in charge of social media strategy. He's their disinfo expert, their meme warrior. He has his separate money machine, again mostly funded by normies.
            </p>
            <p>
             Sandler is important to both men, because as a wealthy pedosadist, he will pay for things that the gang needs to do that cannot easily be explained to the normies. When Brock developed the plan for covering up the Glenn Beck whistleblower incident, he needed Podesta to approve the plan, and to confirm to Sandler that he should pay for it.
            </p>
            <p>
             However, both men are also greedy bastards who exploit their positions in the machine to get rich personally. So they aren't necessarily completely honest with Sandler about how they use the money that he gives them.

               a bit too often, and packs too many topics into a single submission. I would have left Chabad Lubavitch for a separate submission, and focused just on financials. But those are very minor criticisms. It's great research! Thank you

               However, I think you're missing the point if you believe any of these four prior posts make my post unnecessary. In

               , we do get a ton of information about the activities of the Sandler Foundation, such as their using ACORN to go after Wells Fargo, and that is awesome. But there is nothing in that one specifically about David Brock's illegal slush fund at Media Matters, or where it came from. Knowing that the Sandler Foundation donated to MM a decade ago does not help very much with that investigation. We need to look at his
               <em>
                personal
               </em>
               donations starting in 2014, which
               <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/user/ASolo">
                @ASolo
               </a>
               (meaning no disrespect) did not do. We need to look at his interactions with David Brock and John Podesta just before those donations, and again
               <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/user/ASolo">
                @ASolo

               never investigated that. The second submission, mentioning Aaron Dover, is similar. It covers many of the same facts as the first, and it doesn't cover the key facts that I point to. It's sad that Aaron Dover died, but it isn't really relevant to what I'm doing in this project.
              </p>
              <p>
               The other two posts you cite, by other people, are similar as well. Yes, they talk about Herb Sandler and his emails. I did say that those were infamous emails and that everyone has heard of them. But these posts don't make any connection between Sandler and an illegal MM slush fund, or between the slush fund and the current disinfo campaign that is going on right here at
               <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/v/pizzagate">
                /v/pizzagate
               </a>
               . (I see that the one from 9 months ago discussed whether Kathy Tate knew anything about the pedosadist stuff, and came to the same conclusion I have, that she was an innocent.)
              </p>
              <p>
               The point of research is to make specific connections on specific topics. My topic is not ACORN or the crash of 2008, and it is not Chabad Lubavitch or Saturday Night Live skits. They're all really interesting and valid topics for investigation, they're just not what I am working on. If
               <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/user/ASolo">
                @ASolo
               </a>
               feels that I have somehow misused his research, or claimed credit for it that I do not deserve, I'll certainly listen. But I suspect he's just going to nod and agree to the perfectly obvious fact that my submission uses different sources, and mentions specific donations and emails from Sandler that his submission does not (and vice versa). Plenty of room here for everyone to get credit. We're all working on different parts of a large puzzle.

                I don't want to get in between what Mej777 and you might have going on. I respect him/her and the research he/she contributes and really don't exactly know where she/he was coming from but do appreciate the reference, but you are right, your contribution is still in another area however similar the names are and any follow up investigation into the Sandler's is completely warranted and welcomed, and is only a continuation and evolution of all of this work. Mej777 meant well I'm sure.
               </p>
               <p>
                I did enjoy this thread as well, any exposure of this sadistic clan is welcomed, these Sandler's, Sussmans and all these sneaky, underhanded old monied elite meddlers must be exposed.

                 there should be no middle but this guy spent the last week tearing down several researchers who have been here from the beginning. I have pointed out repeatedly his posts are regurgitated ideas he learned from others Work and gives no credit. He calls me a liar and prove it constantly which is a cointel tactic.
                </p>
                <p>
                 I responded this time because of all the work I know you did on this as well as the Aaron Dover part where you are among the few that paid attention to his death and sacrifice.
