            "snuff films aren't real, theres no evidence of them ever actually happening.... Oh what Daisy's destruction? Scully didn't try and kill the children, it was just an accident therefore it's not a real snuff films because it was purposefully"- complete retards on the internet. Just like saying SRA has never happened even though there are well documented cases and people in prison right now that have admitted to it.

            I have posted a video twice about the Catholic church canadian genocide documentary of priest murdering, torturing and molesting children and MF has twice deleted it siting rule #1. This despite the fact that Hampstead, Dutroux and other cases are allowed. What is to be done about these compromised mods? Here is the documentary

            Aaron Swartz co-founder of Reddit. "suicide" by hanging while under FBI investigation for downloaded public documents from MIT...uncover massive sex trafficking and crimes stretching to Asian countries involving "A laptop per child" scheme including the Clinton Foundation that allowed predators and NGO direct access to vulnerable children in poor third world countries via Computer child trafficking.
           </p>
           <p>
            FBI buried the truth were charging him with 35 years in prison in his 20's. He is solely responsible for thousands of investigations that were initiated around the world to stop chills predators.
           </p>
           <p>
            He died of hanging "suicide" so could never speak. After death DOJ under Obama posthumously reduced his sentence so the dead guy has to serve less time now.  Thanks Obama
           </p>
           <p>
            He was placed in the Internet Hall of Fame....he was co-founder of Reddit.

             Which is why they had to come up with charging him with 35 years to give a 'reason' for his so called suicide/that was also not even staged all that well.

             Yes...MIT is part of MK Ultra....this is the assasin sent to Atlanta who murdered the attorney in cold blood. It was caught on camera and he was not alone. There was a team and several assassinations  in Atlanta 
Took place....see links above. He was caught on  camera so sacrificed.

             The investigation came about after several explosions took place in two neighborhoods where Mork lived.

           <p>
            So explosives had already been detonated before he was arrested?
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             In addition, investigators found disturbing material on his computer, including "violent child pornography," "snuff films," and images of the suspect having sexual relations with "seemingly unconscious women," according to the Review-Journal.
            </p>
           </blockquote>
           <p>
            What in the fuck?

           <blockquote>
            <p>
             Mork has yet to be charged with crimes relating to the content on the computer. "They're still trying to image that drive," prosecutor Jake Villani told the Review-Journal. "This was just a triage approach to that drive.
            </p>
           </blockquote>
           <p>
            So it seems he hasn't even been charged for any of the materials found on his computer, they're going off of the explosives thus far.
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             Mork's mother told the Review-Journal from Minnesota that she noticed some peculiar behavior from her son when he visited his parents two years ago. He had been taking medication for depression.
            </p>
           </blockquote>
           <p>
            It's also worth noting that in the news video provided in the link from OP, the suspects' mother also says that he was also on adderrall, but didn't mention any medications pertaining to depression. Wasn't James Holmes (Aurora Theater Massacre) also on anti depressants?

              Yes. These drugs make you malleable and open to suggestion. The best thing to create a group like antifa is to put a bunch of young kids on antidepressants. This is one of the things these drugs were designed for.

             As an ex-Scientologist, I sure fucking hope so. Scientologists are ruthless and smart, and extremely moral generally (despite their specific crazinesses). Scientology analysis techniques are actually highly effective at drawing solid conclusions from limited data. If Scientology is going after the pedos, they would be a very effective ally.

              Except they aren't moral... Sea Org?, the (basically) prisons they run? And their planned infiltration of the US Govt? The Scientology higher ups are probably a significant part of the pedo cabal.

               They're crazy in their own way, believe me I know better than anyone here most likely, but they're deeply devoted to their moral code. Even though that moral code has some obvious flaws, there's no room in it for child rape or satanic ritual abuse.
              </p>
              <p>
               As for their planned infiltration of the US Gov, if they were fighting an international cult of pedo satanists secretly in charge of most of the world, wouldn't that be a pretty incredibly brave thing to do? Wouldn't they be right to attempt to infiltrate and disrupt it?
              </p>
              <p>
               Scientology has none of the same symbolism, none of the behavioral markers, none of the fawning over by the media that pedo-cult related occultism has. I mean really, if they were part of the cult, wouldn't they be allies with the government? If they were part of the cult, wouldn't the compromised governments generally let them get away with everything? Why do all these governments we know to be compromised treat Scientology as a mortal enemy? Doesn't pass the smell test, man.

                Scientology is a covert CIA operation. I explained above. L.Ron Hubbard was involved with Dr.Anthony Kidman and many others in MK Ultra experiments.

                He was in fact a practicing black sex majick OTO member. I realize you don't know this until you get to the top. All of those recordings they make, and video confessions....who do you think gets them when they want for blackmail? CIA...David Miscarravich is buddies with John Podesta and HRC,..

                  I have put forth the evidence. You will need to research Voat threads going back a year. Scientology &amp; L. Ron Hubbard were exposed then.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  Hubbard's estate was even exposed in Washington DC with links to Alefantis.

                 <p>
                  There is more than enough proof. It is saved in documents. Ask Leah Remini?

                   Yes, they are a cult. But, so is Christianity, so is Judaism, Catholicism, Lutheranism, Episcopalianism, Mormonism, Jehova's Witnessism, Hinduism, Islamism, Shinto, Buddhism, et cetera et cetera et cetera. Declaring it a cult is not a good enough argument to get them to stop their bad practices, nor does it negate the ways in which they are/do good.

                    I've witnessed it in person at two scientology centers . Cult . I should add I've been in many churches, including Mormon, synagogues, a few Buddhist temples, etc. I'd say the next one with the most cult qualities  is JW. I would believe there is
                    <em>
                     some
                    </em>
                    good they do,as many churches, etc, do . I think scientology as an organization...or should I sayCompany, is evil, but not all individual members. Surely not most . Many are victims

                     I grew up as a Scientologist and worked in the church for a few years. Didn't join the Sea-Org, but have friends and family who did, some left some are still in. My family was way deep, going back 40 years, and my mother was on first name basis with many of the international execs until Miscavige started throwing everyone and their dog into the RPF (Rehabilitation Project Force, the Scientology "jail"). I likely have a much broader understanding of the religion than you do.

                     Scientology as a religion is actually mostly good, until you reach the higher "OT" levels. Certainly, auditing is not "clearing" anything, and "Clear" is not a real psychological or spiritual state. However, auditing, with the aid of an E-meter, is basically augmented psychological therapy, and reliably produces very good results in people who go into it earnestly. All the fluff and pomp about it is good only as an aid to the placebo effect, making it more likely you'll pursue self-improvement earnestly and without skepticism getting in the way, but that's not much of a criticism since it works. LRH very deliberately structured the culture of Scientology to use social pressure to drive people to self-improvement, and although it can seem crazy, it works. I swear, crossfit stole their peer-pressure to self-improvement culture from Scientology. Anyway, below the OT levels, Scientology is pretty much applied philosophy, cognitive behavioral therapy, and "auditing" to force yourself to confront how you're screwing up your own life. These are highly psychologically beneficial, far more than any other religion. Most Scientologists never reached the OT levels.

                     It's not right to call it a company, there is no one in Scientology getting rich. Sea-Org members live like monks, their self-worth being their devotion to helping mankind survive (only achievable through the application of Scientology). Miscavige is, as far as I can tell, the evil heart of the organization. Perhaps LRH was evil as well, but he ran the church far more competently than Miscavige. For instance, LRH was fanatical about statistics. If you were productive, he would overlook almost anything you did wrong. Miscavige tears down his most productive subordinates if he even suspects them of going one step outside of his doctrine. Anyway, over the past 30 years, Miscavige shifted the culture in Scientology from one of hopeful optimism, where exceptional people rose to leadership and were supported, to one of pessimistic fanaticism where everyone is pounded until they submit or leave. I think the real turning point of doom was when the IAS (International Association of Scientologists) was launched. It is a Scientology principle that you are supposed to "exchange in abundance," meaning give more than your receive, or more than expected, as a moral behavior. The IAS did not deliver services (courses or auditing) in exchange for donations, it just put you on a list of donors by amount donated (though, how much needed to be donated to reach higher positions on the list was not divulged). So, instead of trying to use the healing power of Scientology philosophy and services on their own merits as the vehicle to expansion, the coffers of Scientologists was begged of for nothing in return except social prestige. This was a major violation of Scientology as LRH had laid it out, and it was constant pressure to give to the IAS that started to really destroy Scientologist's financial health. In tandem with this, Miscavige started to change the texts that LRH had written, claiming that the true originals had been found, and that subversive changes made by others than LRH were finally being found out and fixed. Along with this, Miscavige began purging the upper ranks of the religion.

                     It's a mistake to treat Scientologists as hapless victims of a cult (although certainly there are many who are). The vast majority of Scientologists worldwide are inactive, having drifted from the religion in mass-exodus through the mid 90's to the mid 2000's. Most saw the changes and self-contradictions becoming endemic, and left as it became too much. Most did not lose their fortunes giving to the IAS or buying more services than they could afford. Most did not lose touch with friends or have their family torn apart by the religion. The reality is that most Scientologists rightly applied the very reasonable and good foundations of Scientology, and when the organization itself began to run afoul of it's own foundations, Scientologists applied basic Scientology and separated from the suppressive force.

                      thanks for sharing.  and yes, I'm sure you have a much deeper knowledge and understanding of scientology.  as for the e-meter being "augmented psychological therapy" and producing reliable results... I have to say I don't agree with that. at all.  although I'm open to hearing your perspective.   and from my limited experiences at scientology centers, which I think is also a very important perspective, I found the message and approach to be extremely creepy and cultish and saccharine.   I took a lot of the materials with me and felt that way about those as well.  as for no one getting rich... it seems the people at the top are definitely getting rich and really exploiting people to get money.

                       The e-meter is a pretty simple device. It's essentially a lie detector, with the instrumentation presenting the fluctuating electrical resistance of the body a bit differently. I've audited people for maybe 200 hours, give or take, and I can tell you that as you get experienced with it, it becomes very easy to see peoples emotional response on the meter. The movements for happiness, sadness, anger, relief, and general okay-ness and upset-ness are fairly distinct. Now, in the dogma of Scientology, the e-meter is treated as somewhat infallible, that you can't fool it- I happen to know from experience that is nonsense, as I could easily put a happy/content needle "float" up no matter what I was actually feeling. But, doing so ruined your auditing results, thus my statement that earnestly pursuing self-improvement worked, because lying and deceiving resulted in failure of the process. So, while holding the e-meter, you are asked self-exploratory questions by the auditor. The questions are sort of a 20-questions sort of algorithm that helps narrow down the problem you're having, and when asking the questions the auditor observes the reaction of the person and their meter readings to see if that line of questioning produces a negative emotional response. Wherever a negative emotional response is found, you move forward along that line, asking deeper and deeper questions until the person has an epiphany which resolves the problem. I've experienced these epiphanies many times, and they are often quite profound. Everything about Scientology might be a sham, all the explanations for why any of it works might be totally wrong, but earnestly done auditing does very quickly help you resolve psychological stress, and help you to change your own thinking and mind for the better. It is a real shame that the psychological field of science is not using e-meters (or something like them) and algorithmic therapy questioning to help people. It is deeply unfortunate that what's bad about Scientology makes everything that's good about it taboo.

                       I don't know what the pamphlets look like today, I haven't been in a church in over a decade. But, it was certainly always a bit over the top, though that's intentional, as I said. In Scientology doing things half-ass is considered really low-responsibility, so there's a lot of intensity to everything they do. That can certainly come across cultish, even if it weren't.

                       Well, it may seem that way to you, but it's not the truth. First of all, there are no people at the top, only Miscavige. LRH believed in near dictatorial leadership as the most effective method of organization. The positions close to Miscavige have had a pretty high turnover across the past 20 years. As I said my mother knew many of them (she was fairly high up in the church in the 80s), and I still have family that's in the Sea-Org (one of them is very high up, haven't spoken to that person in 15 years, but still get updates through the grape-vine). The lowest and highest rank Sea-Org members live nearly identical lives outside of their rank. They live in the same dorms, they eat at the same cafeteria, they get the same paycheck for personal use, they work the same number of hours, get the same number of days off. This applies to new young adults who joined a year ago and to old executives who've been in for 30 years. Honestly, to think the Sea-Org or its members are money-motivated is to severely underestimate them.

                        I appreciate your perspective.  honestly, I'm extremely skeptical about the e-meter having scientific validity and would have to see research proving it.  even lie detector tests are only 70% accurate, which throws their validity out the window.  and no I never thought sea-org members were motivated by money, they strike me as victims being financially exploited.

                         Just because it can be wrong doesn't mean that it has no scientific value. In the case of the lie detector, that it can be wrong is a legal problem. The lie detector is attempting to determine something very specific, whether a person is being honest in any particular answer. The e-meter, used in auditing, is really only trying to determine if you have a negative emotional response in general, not the cause of that negative response. Seen from this angle, and knowing that the e-meter and lie detector are functionally pretty much identical, it makes sense that the lie detector can be wrong a lot. Asking a person if they killed their wife is bound to be upsetting to them, even if they didn't kill their wife. You can't be sending people to prison based on something that's so hit or miss. In the case of the e-meter, it's an aid to a psychological therapy that is not a legal battle, nor a conflict at all, where there are negative consequences for being wrong. If you're wrong in an auditing session, having been misled by a wrong or misread reading, you just hit a dead end in the questioning, the person being audited says "I don't think there's anything here," and you go back to the previous question. Happens considerably less than 30% of the time, but it does happen, and it's really no big deal. Just means you wasted a minute.

                         Believe me, man, Sea-Org members are not exploited. Financially or otherwise. Again, that's an underestimation. They're actually highly intelligent, capable, and driven people. And, as I said, there's no money being made by anyone. They use all their money to buy real estate, actually, as a method of ensuring indefinite stability. The problem with the organization is not that these people are sheep, trapped in a cult. The problem is that they're highly competent people fanatically engaged in a cause they feel is of greater importance than anything else. The people being financially exploited are the poor saps that take out second mortgages on their homes to give to the IAS.

               As bad as the Sea Org is, and the camps where they seem to work children pretty dang hard, there haven't been too many sexual abuse claims thrown scientologys way. I'd welcome them as an ally any day of the week. The perfect is the enemy of the good.

               Scientology is the government everyone. It is a faction of the CIA. They use it as a blackmail operation against celebrities to keep them quiet.
              </p>
              <p>
               L.Ron Hubbard (Founder of Scientology) was a trained CIA MK Ultra participant.
He was first with Jack Parsons (NASA) and founded the OTO US headquarters with Aleister Crowley guidance. They performed black sex majick rituals together and sacrifice to bring about Majick and the dark occult.
              </p>
              <p>
               You can read their story. Hubbard was personally involved in MK Ultra experience with children including with Dr.Anthony Kidman of Australia....(Nicole's pedophile monster father) of course she would go on to marry Scientology leader Tom Cruise.
              </p>
              <p>
               Dr. Kidman was involved in hunting children for sport. He was outed in 2015 by many victims in Australia. Fled to Singapore and found dead..
              </p>
              <p>
               Hollywood covered the up the whole affair.
              </p>
              <p>
               You want truth ask Leah Remini, J.Lo and a few others who have publicly came out and Leah Remini career ended and threatened.
              </p>
              <p>
               In fact John Podesta and HRC openly discussed in Wikileaks choosing the Church of Scientology Attorney as the next Supreme Court Justice when she wins.
              </p>
              <p>
               Of course this was right before Justice Anthony Scalia was even dead and they had chisen his seat filler.
              </p>
              <p>
               Odd they must see into the future?

                Fiona Barnett can speak to the horrors of Anthony Kidman (who's daughter Nicole was married to Tom Cruise a member of Scientology),  I am sure that a few members may have been involved in her abuse.  Katie Holmes, imo, had a very hard time getting away from him and feared for the safety of their child.  They are a dangerous bunch for sure.

            <p>
             Mork, 40, had been free on bail the last three months after he was arrested on charges that he illegally possessed explosives, a silencer and a gun with a serial number removed.
            </p>
            <p>
             In addition, investigators found disturbing material on his computer, including "violent child pornography," "snuff films," and images of the suspect having sexual relations with "seemingly unconscious women," according to the Review-Journal.
            </p>
            <p>
             Authorities also uncovered video on the computer of Mork "violently beating" a woman, according to the newspaper. The woman had been found unconscious in the lobby of Mork's building.
            </p>
            <p>
             Mork's lawyer Nicholas Woolridge expressed shock at the new terrorism charges against his client, and the $8 million bail amount set by a judge.

            So let me get this straight, he was out on bail for illegal explosives etc/now has 8 mil bail...and yet the bundys (of which I am not a fan but none the less) have been denied bail bc they are a danger to the community?  What is wrong with this picture?

             Sides are developing for a real civil conflict imo... Thats what all of the happenings since 9/11 have been leading to  if you step back and take in the bigger picture..., once we have actionable intelligence someone is going to move on it. The law of probability assures it. They know it to. I assume that they have already factored this into their plans. I thought just maybe the whole Malheur thing was the kickoff at the time but, i guess not yet. Or it was and we just havent realized it yet

              Yeah, Malheur, thought that too.  If they had been successful in killing everyone in the truck instead of just LeVoy it just might have kicked things off.  I mean, think about it, not only 2 well regarded men in the movement but a woman and young woman.  Not like they didn't set the scene for all of them to be killed.  Frankly I was ticked with the Malheur thing...it was stupid, ill planned and the Hammonds were not some poor innocent ranching family.  They were quite violent in their own right if you read their history of terrorizing.  None the less, bundy and company were being supplied by 'deep pockets' and again, imho, not the brightest lights on the tree, easily led into this fiasco/particularly when being constantly fed it's what god wants.  Man, they walked right into that one.  Sheep to the slaughter.
