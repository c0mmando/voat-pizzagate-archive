<p>So for such an individual, the needs are: connections to sources of commodity (children); discretion/group interface for plausible deniability), and of course, money and power.

The below shows some players around Alefantis: not perpetrators, but \'keys’ to the supply (ie they know the people and orgs in charge of children).</p>
<p>I started with those who commented on Alefantis\' Instagram and went backwards through the boards of directors (like his own art non profit, Transformer). I did find some very unusual connections, knowing said individuals and groups would be highly useful for a motivated pedo or \'investor\' in children. The art world and high finance world are the nexxus of all these connections because money and intel activity converge around the DC art world.</p>
<p>Alefantis and art world friends interact with power. See Brock’s 2009 Media Matters party: photos of Brock, Al Franken, Barney Frank, James Alefantis, L.J. Alefantis and Susan Alefantis and others, including Izette Folger (much more on her below).</p>

<p>All members are ‘important; an interesting case study is: Izette Folger, a painter and professional socialite of the East Coast art and politics power scene. Her father is Michael Maccoby, 83-year-old psychoanalyst with big connex/money through his eponymous Group. But that in itself is not as interesting as the fact that he was on board of a childrens charity from 1977-2014 that is part of a worldwide charity started in Mexico in the 1950s with Church connex.
 Our Little Brothers and Sisters, Inc.. 3999 Great Harvest Court/ Dumfries, VA 22025 </p>
<p>OLBS has for VP Mary Sue Conaway- retired senior State Dept. official; from 2005-7 was Manager, International Parental Child Abduction, Office of Children\'s Issues</p>
<p>Its deceased Director: Eugene C. Latham (died in 2016 aged 83; had lived in Mexico for fifty years and worked in investing and opening LA markets- <a href="http://www.independentri.com/new_obituaries/article_dc270cb6-f2c8-11e5-87b3-43bf6ab9733e.html">http://www.independentri.com/new_obituaries/article_dc270cb6-f2c8-11e5-87b3-43bf6ab9733e.html)</a>)</p>
<p>The main connex of OLBS is Nuestros Pequeños Hermanos (NPH): </p>
<p><a href="http://www.olbs911.org">http://www.olbs911.org</a></p>
<p>“Founded in 1968, the mission of Our Little Brothers &amp; Sisters(OLBS) is to support the efforts of Nuestros Pequeños Hermanos (NPH) in helping orphaned and abandoned children in Latin America and Haiti. OLBS supports homes for more than 3,400 orphaned and abandoned children in Mexico, etc.... From merely the POV of logistics, it would have the access and system to facilitate large-scale movement of people in all the most vulnerable (and also developed) countries.</p>
<p>Izette Maccoby Folger is ALSO on the board of Innocents at Risk</p>
<p><a href="http://www.innocentsatrisk.org/about/board-of-directors">http://www.innocentsatrisk.org/about/board-of-directors</a></p>
<p>Too many Innocents at Risk board members to explore but some examples:</p>
<p>French-born Portuguese woman Cidalia Luis-Akbar is married to Masud Akbar and is the president of American Hauling &amp; Paving, “a local woman-owned road construction company” in DC area (says Wikipedia). She has a photo of herself and Michelle Obama on her office wall, and is also a board member of Circle of Care at Children\'s Hospital, and works with CARE International, and Refugees International. Akbar was born in the US as the son of an Afghan diplomat, but went on to be Karzai’s press man after the invasion, is today an investment broker and on the board of something called the ‘Afghanistan Foundation’ and the Children’s Hospital. a photo of them:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.ypouscap-photos.org/FY16-20152016/12-04-15-Holiday-Party-at-the/i-2K9MPjC">http://www.ypouscap-photos.org/FY16-20152016/12-04-15-Holiday-Party-at-the/i-2K9MPjC</a>
Innocents at Risk won a 500,000 award from the Maryland branch of ANOTHER human trafficking watchdog, Soroptimist International in 2012:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.innocentsatrisk.org/about/awards">http://www.innocentsatrisk.org/about/awards</a></p>
<p>Isabelle Ernst is another board member of IAR with a background in wealthy art collecting- she was born into it: a feature report said “De la Cruz Ernst is the daughter of eminent Miami art collectors Carlos and Rosa de la Cruz, whose collection of contemporary art is so vast that they built their own museum to display it in (de la Cruz Collection Contemporary Art Space)… parties she hosts in Hillandale’s ballroom, everything from Plácido Domingo’s birthday to benefits for The Washington Ballet and Washington Performing Arts Society.”</p>
<p><a href="http://capitolfile-magazine.com/inside-isabel-de-la-cruz-ernst-artistic-mansion">http://capitolfile-magazine.com/inside-isabel-de-la-cruz-ernst-artistic-mansion</a></p>
<p>Isabel de la Cruz Ernst: Carlos, her father, is a CFR member and big businessman. “After restoring the Hillandale Mansion as their home, she established her own development company, ERNST DEVELOPMENT, dedicated to renovating and building very contemporary spaces. Isabel is a member of the Washington National Opera Board and dedicates a significant part of her time to charitable work including Refugees International, the Seed School, and Innocents at Risk among others. Isabel is married to Ricardo Ernst, a professor at Georgetown University&quot;.</p>
<p>Back to Izette Folger. See her entertaining friends in a private club opposite establishment mag Foreign Policy:</p>

<p>Here she is in 2006 pictured with Alefantis:</p>
<p><a href="http://washingtonlife.com/directories/photos/?letter=I&amp;name=Izette-Folger">http://washingtonlife.com/directories/photos/?letter=I&amp;name=Izette-Folger</a></p>

<p><a href="https://washingtonlife.smugmug.com/keyword/Izette%20Folger/">https://washingtonlife.smugmug.com/keyword/Izette%20Folger/</a></p>
<p>And at 2012 Russian Embassy ball, with Alefantis and her sis, Nora Maccaby as well as DEBORAH SIGMUND founder of Innocents at Risk:</p>
<p><a href="https://washingtonlife.smugmug.com/Category/Washington-Ballet-Rock-n-Roll/i-S94Xwjh/A">https://washingtonlife.smugmug.com/Category/Washington-Ballet-Rock-n-Roll/i-S94Xwjh/A</a></p>
<p>Izette is married to Neil Folger. HE is the son of Lee and Juliet Folger, who have serious banking and philanthropic foundation for the arts and childrens causes. This means on both her father’s side and her husband’s side, and on her own board activity, Izette Folger would have all the contacts anyone could want for organizations dealing with vulnerable children internationally.
The Folger fortune= FOLGER NOLAN FLEMING DOUGLAS. Neil Folger is a portfolio manager there. His father is the boss. It is located at… Connecticut Ave/ K Street, DC (725 15th St NW #1). It “is an investment advisor that manages 768.3 MM dollars in regulatory AUM and has 4 employees, of which 4 perform investment advisory functions. “</p>
<p><a href="http://www.symmetric.io/hedge-fund-employee/LEE-M-FOLGER-16FA0">http://www.symmetric.io/hedge-fund-employee/LEE-M-FOLGER-16FA0</a> </p>
<p>The Lee and Juliet Folger Fund  (formerly The Folger Fund) is at 1320 Old Chain Bridge Rd., Ste. 425  McLean, VA:
 <a href="https://fconline.foundationcenter.org/grantmaker-profile?collection=grantmakers&amp;key=FOLG001">https://fconline.foundationcenter.org/grantmaker-profile?collection=grantmakers&amp;key=FOLG001</a></p>
<p>Both Alefantis and the Folger Fund are listed donors to the Smithsonian. (Incidentally, another Transformer board member Pinar O’Leary had a big role at the Smithsinonian, is married to former Clinton admin guy William R O’Leary and served as a ‘talent scout’ for Latino performers at some point for Obama’s first campaign).</p>

<p>Both Alefantis Group and FOLGER NOLAN FLEMING DOUGLAS are listed HRC campaign donors:

<p>Even more interesting is in Transformer’s ‘Visionary Friends’ group. These are individuals, in addition to their donors (big groups like NED), etc. Among these individuals we find Neil and Izette Folger, music friends, Kate Damon, and the now divorced Tony Podesta and Heather Podesta.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.transformerdc.org/give/visionary-friends">http://www.transformerdc.org/give/visionary-friends</a></p>
<p>The history of the podesta relationship is in this article. This article also specifies that Tony went off the rails from 2013 following the beginning of their divorce, which could have affected his state of mind towards other kinds of outlets.</p>

<p>The other week, the charity did its 13th annual Silent Auction, which brings together the DC power elite. (It would be interesting to know how the atmosphere was this year in light of #pizzagate.)</p>
<p>NORTHERN VIRGINIA HOSPITALS CONNECTION</p>
<p>Alefantis and Associates, John Podesta (who gave over 50K), and the above mentioned Soroptimist International all donated to INOVA HEALTH FOUNDATION in 2009. The philanthropic arm of what is also a medical non-profit, Inova runs several medical centers in Northern Virginia (including a children’s hospital), wins awards and is (as it says) always ‘on the lookout for new patients.’ It would be very interesting to consult with some medical professionals as to how difficult it is to get organ transplantations for babies and infants, in general. It is not really important whether this particular place is or is not part of something nefarious but rather the structure.</p>',

           Izette is married to Neil Folger. HE is the son of Lee and Juliet Folger, who have serious banking and philanthropic foundation for the arts and childrens causes. This means on both her father’s side and her husband’s side, and on her own board activity, Izette Folger would have all the contacts anyone could want for organizations dealing with vulnerable children internationally.
The Folger fortune= FOLGER NOLAN FLEMING DOUGLAS. Neil Folger is a portfolio manager there. His father is the boss. It is located at… Connecticut Ave/ K Street, DC (725 15th St NW #1). It “is an investment advisor that manages 768.3 MM dollars in regulatory AUM and has 4 employees, of which 4 perform investment advisory functions. “

           Both Alefantis and the Folger Fund are listed donors to the Smithsonian. (Incidentally, another Transformer board member Pinar O’Leary had a big role at the Smithsinonian, is married to former Clinton admin guy William R O’Leary and served as a ‘talent scout’ for Latino performers at some point for Obama’s first campaign).

           Even more interesting is in Transformer’s ‘Visionary Friends’ group. These are individuals, in addition to their donors (big groups like NED), etc. Among these individuals we find Neil and Izette Folger, music friends, Kate Damon, and the now divorced Tony Podesta and Heather Podesta.

           The history of the podesta relationship is in this article. This article also specifies that Tony went off the rails from 2013 following the beginning of their divorce, which could have affected his state of mind towards other kinds of outlets.

           The other week, the charity did its 13th annual Silent Auction, which brings together the DC power elite. (It would be interesting to know how the atmosphere was this year in light of #pizzagate.)

           Alefantis and Associates, John Podesta (who gave over 50K), and the above mentioned Soroptimist International all donated to INOVA HEALTH FOUNDATION in 2009. The philanthropic arm of what is also a medical non-profit, Inova runs several medical centers in Northern Virginia (including a children’s hospital), wins awards and is (as it says) always ‘on the lookout for new patients.’ It would be very interesting to consult with some medical professionals as to how difficult it is to get organ transplantations for babies and infants, in general. It is not really important whether this particular place is or is not part of something nefarious but rather the structure.
