<blockquote>
<p>Amidst shocking allegations that Roy Moore pursued relationships with girls ranging in age from 14-18 years old when he was in his 30s, a new poll shows that 37% of evangelicals are “more likely” to vote for Moore, while another 34% say that these allegations make “no difference.” Some of his supporters have upped the ante by saying that even if the allegations are proven true, they won’t think Moore did anything wrong because they didn’t actually have sex and “he was single” at the time.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Says that it is due to Religous Right\'s embrace of the  Biblical Patriarchy and Quiverfull movements:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Many who embrace Biblical Patriarchy and Quiverfull came to the conclusion that contemporary dating practices are harmful to young people and sought to replace them with a system of “courtship” that occurs under the direction of a girl’s father. Courtship is intended to be specifically focused on finding a marriage partner—almost a pre-betrothal, if you will. Courtship happens in the context of a homeschooling family and community where boys are raised to be adventurous and economically self-sufficient with skills that might prove useful in a societal collapse, while girls are raised to be “pure,” meek, dependent and submissive with the goal of becoming appropriate “help-meets” in their future husbands’ exercise of dominion. Independence, autonomy, and self-sufficiency on the part of girls is seen as a (sinful) violation of feminine nature.
...</p>
<p>The result is that 14-year-old girls are seen as appropriately “courted” by older men.</p>
<p>In fact, a series of scandals rocked the Christian homeschool world in recent years in which older men admitted to inappropriate contact in pursuing young (sometimes very young) girls. See the story of Doug Phillips and Vision Forum here and the stories of Bill Gothard and his Institute in Biblical Life Principles/Advanced Training Institute and Josh Duggar, here. Josh Duggar was accused of molesting young girls (including his sisters) when he himself was rather young but his targets were even younger. In each scandal a core group of supporters defended the accused.</p>

            Roy plays the religious right for their votes with his stunts like putting a statue of the 10commandments in the courthouse.  He espouses all their key issues so they think he is wonderful.  It’s so easy, to play them and no matter how many of their heroes, preachers, politicians turn out to have feet of clay the get fooled over and over.  Baker, Falwell, Gingrich (married 3 times and still they think he is holy).  Methinks some folks need to watch Elmer Gantry a few times.  Whether or not the charges are true, Roy Moore is using Christians to promote himself.  Playing the religious right like a fiddle.

            Marjorie Reese says she is going to vote for Roy Moore because nothing definitive has been proven yet.  I agree with her and I am a Progressive Dem/Independent.  We should also remember that raw story has  moved to be a much more liberal site.  It was not when it started out, but like many sites, it has been taken over by the Pod People.  I agree with  everything

            I throw the pedo Republicans and Democrats in the same bag. For instance McCain, Bush Sr., and Bush Jr. are all scumbags, and there are certainly more. But so far this Roy Moore situation looks like an artificial hit piece. The Luciferians hate Roy Moore for defending Christianity. They specifically targeted him in an effort to target Christianity. The Luciferians goal is to destroy the nuclear family structure and all cohesive support systems decent people have.

            Those articles are worthy of a hit piece that

            would post. The people referenced in the article are not true Christians. Evangelicals are a radical sect that do not accurately reflect true Christianity. They are a cult that hides within Christianity and under it's umbrella. No big surprise there.

             Dude you are a douchebag.  Nobody cares who you consider "real" Christians.  What they said about dating is 100% Christian and sensible. You are so fucking out to lunch you don't even know how Americans behaved before the Jewish Sexual Revolution, LMAO!!!  DUDE SRSLY
