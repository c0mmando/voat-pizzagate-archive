            (CNN) — This week's WikiLeaks publication of stolen emails from Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta reveals some inner turmoil about negative campaigning against Democratic primary opponents -- and it seems to be Bill and Hillary Clinton themselves who are on the nastier side of the debate.

            Related Article: What we've learned from the hacked emails of Hillary Clinton's campaign (so far)
On Saturday, January 16, 2016, Neera Tanden, who currently helps run the Clinton campaign transition team, wrote to Podesta to tell him "well done tweet!"
The tweet in question, sent that day, was likely one from Podesta to David Brock, telling him to stop demanding that Clinton's then-rival, Sen. Bernie Sanders, release his medical records.
"Chill out," Podesta tweeted to Brock. "We're fighting on who would make a better President, not on who has a better Physical Fitness Test."
.@davidbrockdc: Chill out. We're fighting on who would make a better President, not on who has a better Physical Fitness Test.
— John Podesta (
            <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/user/johnpodesta">
             @johnpodesta
            </a>
            ) January 17, 2016
Podesta responded that he was irritated because he'd wanted to send the tweet the day before but had been told to hold it.
"I am passed (sic) about one thing," Podesta responded. "I suggested doing that at 4:30 and got held."
"You mean pissed?" Tanden asked. "Got held by who? Hillary. God. Her instincts are suboptimal. Pretty typical though. I would not be surprised if wjc told him to do it. Just as I'm pretty sure mark Penn didn't do his cocaine rang against Obama without some higher up approval."
           </p>
           <p>
            Related Article: John Podesta emails: Latest Wikileaks release
Tanden here is giving voice (in a private and since stolen email) to a concern that President Bill Clinton told Brock to attack Sanders' health, and also suggesting that in 2007 when Clinton aide Mark Penn on MSNBC repeatedly mentioned then-Senator Obama's high school era cocaine use, he had been told to do so by someone much higher up.

when HRC was secretary of state she spent a good time of time doing gossip
emails with Sid Blumenthal about various matters, the ubiquitous Lanny
Davis shilling for himself in pathetic ways, and Neera Tanden gossiping
about what Soros thinks of Obama. At least Tanden I regard as a serious

             I was not in touch with you at the time of the healthcare debate, but what
Sid suggests does not strike me as your style. I was in very regular and
close touch with Daschle at the time, and he would never have said to the
press what Sid suggests, and since I am in the press I know those were not
his views. I guarantee that based on direct personal knowledge of Tom's
views and actions at the time. Blumenthal did not have the slightest idea
of what he was talking about in his girlie gossip with the secretary of
state about this. Why she places such great stock over so much time in
these exchanges with Blumenthal is mystifying to me---and frankly
troublesome.

             This whole subject, to use vernacular, gives me the creeps. Secretaries
of state, presidential candidates and presidents should not be spending
their time on this kind of minor league stuff.

              John, assume I wrote a thousand words about this. It is disquieting that
when HRC was secretary of state she spent a good time of time doing gossip
emails with Sid Blumenthal about various matters, the ubiquitous Lanny
Davis shilling for himself in pathetic ways, and Neera Tanden gossiping
about what Soros thinks of Obama. At least Tanden I regard as a serious
person. Sid and Lanny I do not by standards of a secretary of state or
potential president.

              I was not in touch with you at the time of the healthcare debate, but what
Sid suggests does not strike me as your style. I was in very regular and
close touch with Daschle at the time, and he would never have said to the
press what Sid suggests, and since I am in the press I know those were not
his views. I guarantee that based on direct personal knowledge of Tom's
views and actions at the time. Blumenthal did not have the slightest idea
of what he was talking about in his girlie gossip with the secretary of
state about this. Why she places such great stock over so much time in
these exchanges with Blumenthal is mystifying to me---and frankly
troublesome.

            Amrita sent an email thanking John Podesta for the the Casa Podesta Pizza Party and mentions Neera's husband:

             Dear John,
A quick note to thank you and Mary for a most enjoyable dinner and conversation yesterday. Needless to say, both Ashok and I were delighted to be with you and Mary again for such a special evening. It was a pleasure to meet your brother Tony, ( I did not know earlier you had a brother) We had not met Neera's husband Ben before, and it was good to meet him, too.
Wishing you safe and successful journeys for your planned schedules ahead.
Warmest regards, and big hugs to you and Mary,
Amrita

              John, assume I wrote a thousand words about this. It is disquieting that
when HRC was secretary of state she spent a good time of time doing gossip
emails with Sid Blumenthal about various matters, the ubiquitous Lanny
Davis shilling for himself in pathetic ways, and Neera Tanden gossiping
about what Soros thinks of Obama. At least Tanden I regard as a serious
person. Sid and Lanny I do not by standards of a secretary of state or
potential president.

             <p>
              I was not in touch with you at the time of the healthcare debate, but what
Sid suggests does not strike me as your style. I was in very regular and
close touch with Daschle at the time, and he would never have said to the
press what Sid suggests, and since I am in the press I know those were not
his views. I guarantee that based on direct personal knowledge of Tom's
views and actions at the time. Blumenthal did not have the slightest idea
of what he was talking about in his girlie gossip with the secretary of
state about this. Why she places such great stock over so much time in
these exchanges with Blumenthal is mystifying to me---and frankly
troublesome.
             </p>
             <p>
              This whole subject, to use vernacular, gives me the creeps. Secretaries
of state, presidential candidates and presidents should not be spending
their time on this kind of minor league stuff.

Hillary holds a lot of stock in Sid. She may just talk what we think is gossip and fluff with him but when at home or in secret I am sure there are much more interesting topics of discussion. Sid goes way back. I think we talked about him way back on here, he was very involved during Bills reign. He has investments in Benghazi and elsewhere in the Middle East. They are going to try to convince us from every way to Sunday that it was the Russians and not Seth. Something set them off and it could be a few things. The Voter Outreach, the solar control of voting vvoting machines, Molly Macauley also was killed the same weekend.
