<p>Here is a short synopsis </p>
<p>A deliciously entertaining look at Lord Glenconner, a Scottish lord who bought the tiny Caribbean island of Mustique in 1956 for a song and turned it into a playground for the rich and famous, including Mick Jagger, David Bowie, Tommy Hilfiger, and various British royalty such as Princess Margaret and Prince Andrew. But in the late \'70s the &quot;Jet-Set Monarch&quot; ran out of money, lost control of his island, and was banished to nearby St. Lucia. Director Joseph Bullman and producer Vikram Jayanti follow the indomitable Glenconner as he visits Mustique for the first time in ten years. Equal parts high comedy and shock theatre, his return stirs up old animosities and creates new ones. Hilarious, pathetic, sly and charming, Lord Glenconner may be one man\'s argument for reviving the guillotine and another\'s swan song for &quot;this blessed plot, this earth, this realm this England.&quot;</p>

<p>Somehow wealthy men and pedophilia seem to be very much intertwined and such is the case here. Take a look at this article about a heist gone array.   The thieves found pictures of a prominent politician involved with pedophilia. They were so disgusted by the pictures they left them on the floor so that the police would find them and investigate. And also in this article they talk about the queen\'s Sister frequenting this island and being involved with younger man, or boys? Here are the excerpts from the article;</p>
<p>&quot;The Government of the time allegedly forced the press to stop reporting on the burglary as a matter of national security amid allegations raunchy photos of the late Princess Margaret were found in another safety deposit box in the vault.&quot;</p>
<p>And also this;</p>
<p>&quot;At the time of the raid, Princess Margaret’s marriage to Antony Armstrong-Jones, Earl of Snowdon, was in its final stages.</p>
<p>In the 60s and 70s the Queen’s sister was known to party hard on the Caribbean island of Mustique, where she was pictured with lover Roddy Llewellyn, a landscape gardener 17 years her junior.</p>
<p>NOTE she went to the island is Mustique</p>
<p>She is said to have taken snaps of male friends frolicking naked but it is not known if any were ever taken of her.</p>
<p>The ex-raider would only say: “I can’t talk about that.”
But the latest claims, revealed to the Daily Mirror, are more disturbing and further evidence of the Establishment cover-up of powerful paedophiles.&quot;</p>

            Most of the "wealthy" are Jews and crypto Jews.  All royalty are Jews and crypto Jews.

            Take this story.  LORD Glenconner.  Titled nobility = Jewish.

            If you want to read an ancient account of how they behave, see the Babylonian Talmud.  If you want to learn WHY they do this, the answers lie in anthropology and medicine.

            On Princess Margaret, who had an affair with a well known gangster and drug lord:

            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            "The most famous version of this theory was turned into an entertaining film in 2008 called The Bank Job. Based loosely on the Baker Street robbery, it alleges that British intelligence had hired the gang to raid the safety deposit boxes at the bank to retrieve pornographic photographs of a prominent member of royalty. Although not named, rumors have circulated for decades that this royal was the Queen's sister Princess Margaret.
           </p>
           <p>
            Margaret had already skirted dangerously close to scandal in the 60s and 70s. She was notorious for her louche lifestyle and association with several disreputable and criminal figures. It is highly probable MI5, the UK's internal intelligence service, was at least keeping tabs on Margaret. Was the robbery an operation to prevent a highly damaging Royal scandal becoming public?"

            Well just what are you supposed to do in life when you have achieved all the fame and fortunate and power  imaginable??? There are studies of pedophiles   from the low to middle classes but none that I've stumbled upon representing the 1%  Certainly  their minds and morals are different . Could it be that they have been unwittingly groomed  by a combination of distracted, aloof and distant parents while  attending all male boarding schools where their own abuse was business as usual?  It makes you want to revisit the Princess Diana/ royal family dynamic. She had to have been aware since she was close to Prince Andrew' s wife, Fergy.

             I went through this system and it is true that we went through a conditioning program to prepare us for a role in life to rule over others. Some, mainly first born and dutiful, were sexually abused by teachers and a number of them went on to abuse younger boys. Those who went into law seem to be predisposed to being spanked, those who went into business became serial adulterers, those who went into politics or public life were the real creepers. The rest of us live quietly in the country with our bitchy wifes and smelly dogs.

            Princess Margaret's penchant was for black cock and cocaine. Endemic amongst upper class ladies at that time. The photo you refer to was of a well-endowed London gangster John Biden whose party trick was to balance a pint glass on his erect member.
