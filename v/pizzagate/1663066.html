            Makes sense, when I feel like crap I focus on positive activity and forgotten that I felt crappy. When I mope my energy is low, I think it's feeling heaviness of dark. I'm trying to be more aware of these things especially now.

            muggles aren't necessarily bad, right? I'd put myself in that category. When I fully concentrate on it, it's worked. Could be coincidence, but maybe coincidence was the answer to that? Gyorgy didn't croak yet, but the investigation will cause him to croak financially, that's life for him. Greed of money.

            Kinda like a post I saw (on one of the chans or here, it runs together now) about white magic witches. I'm all about the sun and it's light, it's life. My negatives might be discounted by the positives of light overwhelming it. The fact that I know it's a bad, dark energy doing me no good is a benefit of 'the light' At least I hope. The sun is coming out as I write this. Nice timing based sun ;)

            Someone did close to where I live recently, will post article later on..seems vigilante groups are just gonna do the job if our govt can't. And they're forming now. I guess the molestor (and he ain't a victim of nuthin!) was out on bond for another sex offense and being that he was reoffending he was on the SO list. Can't imagine the detectives working this TOOOOO hard.
           </p>
           <p>
            I have one on my street, he's from the south. Many SO from the south moved up here. I imagine I can guess why, good ol boys are aplenty. He's in the wrong hood, we have good ol boy/gangster hybrids around. I take charges into account, knowing many are plead down, the actual offense is probably much worse. He was convicted with penetration of less than 13 yo. If I get some terminal cancer, that's the sorta shit I'd do. If people are terminal, what CAN they do to punish you any more? Pedo killing would be a heaven and I'm a lil ashamed of my thinking. But I've had the shit happen, so my anger is a bit heated for that reason. Mine served no justice, if my dad had found out, he'd went to prison. I just wanted to drop it, I felt dirty and did end up in therapy. It's probably what's kept me from hurting any of em, anger management techniques too. I still hold anger among other things. The traumas last, and manifest in many ways through a lifetime.
           </p>
           <p>
            Disclaimer: scenario, imaginations are wild in my head, so please no visits to the house Feds k thx Unless I get cancer, God forbid. My ma was gone in months from pancreatic cancer. The worst would be croaking in jail like Gotti did. However if the govt doesn't do something, this is gonna get ugly in the streets. Think Duterte, I believe in his methods for cleaning filth. This is why pedos must be stopped, he's obviously loose a few marbles, and because a priest raped him. All ya gotta do is look at him and see another spectrum of how abuse victims end up. Especially ones given great power...

            I am Catholic, but haven't actually gone to church since 16yo. On Election Day I took advantage of the fact that were voting at a Catholic Church. I prayed that the right person would win, that loves our country, and to keep that person safe, and of good, not of a corrupted mind. I hadn't even gotten into investigating PG yet, but was indeed looking at Wikileaks not knowing wtf to even search. Somehow I ended up just reading by senders. I remember being tipped to the code usage, because as a parent, you learn this, usually by spelling, but as kids grow you must improvise.
           </p>
           <p>
            Anyway. There's seriously something to be said for positive prayer, especially en masses. I must confess that while staring at a picture of Soros for a good 15 min last week, I focused on his demise, even his imminent death. I worry about that negative energy. Rarely do I fall to it. I might could use a small prayer, just in case. But his demise may not have been taken as negative energy, maybe my frustration was sensed. Demise can very well entail his complete downfall (I asked all his associates fall btw). Now that he's being investigated, I think the positive portion was answered. See, He understands that we do feel a bit dark, but talking to Him is seeking the light, thus I reckon he forgives this.
           </p>
           <p>
            First energy 25th goes to the kids and adults trapped, they get this everyday from me as is, but it'll be stronger then. I don't think praying or asking for some punishment or demise is too awful to ask, we are dealing with moloch worshiping scum, He knows, and we should also ask that he have mercy on us for undoubtedly bad feelings we've had, even toward others in life. And to have mercy if we inadvertently asked wrongly, and for Him to use his own methods and trust He will make justice come (they WILL be done) Tis ends my novel (sorry lol)

            There is some merit to positive thinking and even the placebo effect that is recognised. So perhaps there is a global consciousness as per
            <a href="http://noosphere.princeton.edu/">
             this research suggests
            </a>
            and a global meditation/prayer session could make a difference... But these are all hypothesis' and theories thus far...
           </p>
           <p>
            I agree, there is big community support for it here and I have no problem with it - it just shouldn't be stickied.
           </p>
           <p>
            Edit: I also think it's unfair to call it foolish desperation - it's not a last resort, it's just people doing what they do and have always done. They aren't impeding the investigation (provided Voat PizzaGate doesn't become a place of worship)..

            To the people ragging on this idea, you're obviously a teenager or very early 20's, new to pizzagate, or you're a shill. You just don't get it. There is objective evil in this world. I'm not religious and never have been. But evil exists and permeates this planet.
           </p>
           <p>
            Let's do a thought experiment. Are you capable of abducting a 4 year old girl from her parents, listening to her screaming, taking her to an underground facility, storing her in a cage for weeks or months while torturing her, raping her, listening to her screaming out for her parents, pumping her full of drugs, dragging her out of her cage and taking her to a church, guiding her out in front of a group of other onlookers who are chanting and praying wearing robes, crucifying her, looking her in the eyes and then flaying her while she's alive, cutting up her body, eating her, drinking her blood and then having an orgy in her remains? Are you capable of doing that? Explain to me how a human being (millions of them) is capable of doing that, while you and I would probably rather kill ourselves. Please go on, explain it, I'll wait.
           </p>
           <p>
            We're all one consciousness and this is spiritual. This isn't just criminal, it's on an entirely different level. This is complete good vs. evil, there is no other way to explain what's happening here.

            How about we pray instead for God to save all the lost children? Justice should follow naturally.
           </p>
           <p>
            Praying for arrests is too much like cursing. Evil only feeds on evil. You can only defeat evil with good. Don't fall for Satan's tricks.
           </p>
           <p>
            Pray with me to save the children and protect them from evil. God's wrath is much more powerful than simply carrying out arrests.

            Jesus was never satanic. It was the pagan Romans who pretended to be followers of Jesus who were satanic, along with many of their successors. Jesus also never said he was God the Father. That's what Muslims and Jews complain about, but he meant merely to be a role model, not a pretended god. He quoted King David's psalm that said ye are gods, meaning we all are "children" of God who must behave in moral ways. I pray that the institution of human trafficking and terrorism come to an end asap.

            I think its weird that the timing is 11:11 and the other post had it from 11:11 to 11:33 which are occult, satanic, mason numbers. Why does praying or meditating have to happen exactly then? Why cant anyone do it anytime before that? Or right now? seems to me like some ritualistic shit to me.

            again, mental gymnastics. once you make your magical "personal beliefs"  known to a PUBLIC forum that already has issues with reputability, my issue is no longer with what you believe in private.
           </p>
           <p>
            by the way being positive and thinking about what you want works because it changes your fucking behaviour and makes you more mindful. there is no magical law of attraction

            My moral code and spiritual calling is what had me stumble across pizza gate itself. 
It is all based upon something darker than you could imagine, regardless if you yourself or anyone believes so. I understand it's hard to comprehend, maybe you have resentment or were never exposed to these types of things. Why not fight it with something positive ? What could be so wrong with that? I'll be sure to pray for you too...

            religion and spirituality are nebulous things that aren't based in reality. children being raped, tortured and sacrificed are very, very real.

            to even waste time with some non-scientific horseshit is offensive.

            Pray every day. Pray often. Pray G_d directly. Pray angels and saints for intercession.
Say one of David’s psalms or pray with your own words. Pray without words. 
It could be a short, silent prayer. 
Remember, these kids are terrified and completely alone, facing absolute evil. 
So far prayer is the only thing we can oppose. So far...

             The original, long version of the Prayer To Saint Michael The Archangel, His Shield to Protect us &amp; His Sword to Strike Down the Wicked~
            </p>
            <p>
             “O Glorious Prince of the heavenly host, St. Michael the Archangel, defend us in the battle and in the terrible warfare that we are waging against the principalities and powers, against the rulers of this world of darkness, against the evil spirits.
            </p>
            <p>
             Come to the aid of man, whom Almighty God created immortal, made in His own image and likeness, and redeemed at a great price from the tyranny of Satan.
            </p>
            <p>
             “Fight this day the battle of the Lord, together with the holy angels, as already thou hast fought the leader of the proud angels, Lucifer, and his apostate host, who were powerless to resist thee, nor was there place for them any longer in Heaven.
            </p>
            <p>
             That cruel, ancient serpent, who is called the devil or Satan who seduces the whole world, was cast into the abyss with his angels. Behold, this primeval enemy and slayer of men has taken courage.
            </p>
            <p>
             Transformed into an angel of light, he wanders about with all the multitude of wicked spirits, invading the earth in order to blot out the name of God and of His Christ, to seize upon, slay and cast into eternal perdition souls destined for the crown of eternal glory.
            </p>
            <p>
             This wicked dragon pours out, as a most impure flood, the venom of his malice on men of depraved mind and corrupt heart, the spirit of lying, of impiety, of blasphemy, and the pestilent breath of impurity, and of every vice and iniquity.
            </p>
            <p>
             "These most crafty enemies have filled and inebriated with gall and bitterness the Church, the spouse of the immaculate Lamb, and have laid impious hands on her most sacred possessions.
            </p>
            <p>
             In the Holy Place itself, where the See of Holy Peter and the Chair of Truth has been set up as the light of the world, they have raised the throne of their abominable impiety, with the iniquitous design that when the Pastor has been struck, the sheep may be.
            </p>
            <p>
             “Arise then, O invincible Prince, bring help against the attacks of the lost spirits to the people of God, and give them the victory. They venerate thee as their protector and patron; in thee holy Church glories as her defense against the malicious power of hell; to thee has God entrusted the souls of men to be established in heavenly beatitude.
            </p>
            <p>
             Oh, pray to the God of peace that He may put Satan under our feet, so far conquered that he may no longer be able to hold men in captivity and harm the Church. Offer our prayers in the sight of the Most High, so that they may quickly find mercy in the sight of the Lord; and vanquishing the dragon, the ancient serpent, who is the devil and Satan, do thou again make him captive in the abyss, that he may no longer seduce the nations. Amen.
            </p>
            <p>
             O Lord, hear my prayer.
             <br/>
             And let my cry come unto Thee.
            </p>
            <p>
             Let us pray.
             <br/>
             O God, the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, we call upon Thy holy Name, and as supplicants, we implore Thy clemency, that by the intercession of Mary, ever Virgin Immaculate and our Mother, and of the glorious St. Michael the Archangel, Thou wouldst deign to help us against Satan and all the other unclean spirits who wander about the world for the injury of the human race and the ruin of souls. Amen.”

            <p>
             Short Prayer to St. Michael the Archangel
            </p>
            <p>
             The well-known short version of this prayer follows in English and Latin. Pope Leo XIII, Installed: 20 February 1878 - Term ended:
20 July 1903, ordered this prayer to be recited daily after Low Mass in all the churches throughout the Catholic world. However this practice was almost completely swept away in the 1960s by liturgical changes made in the wake of Vatican Council II.    However, on April 24th 1994, Pope John Paul II (now a canonized Saint) recommended the Catholic faithful to continue praying the St. Michael Exorcism prayer.
            </p>
            <p>
             Saint Michael the Archangel, defend us in battle, be our protection against the malice and snares of the devil.
            </p>
            <p>
             May God rebuke him we humbly pray; and do thou, O Prince of the Heavenly host, by the power of God, thrust into hell Satan and all evil spirits who wander through the world for the ruin of souls. Amen.
            </p>
            <p>
             Sáncte Míchael Archángele, defénde nos in proélio, cóntra nequítiam et insídias diáboli ésto præsídium. Ímperet ílli Déus, súpplices deprecámur: tuque, prínceps milítiæ cæléstis, Sátanam aliósque spíritus malígnos, qui ad perditiónem animárum pervagántur in múndo, divína virtúte, in inférnum detrúde. Ámen

             Jesus was a light in the darkness in His earthly ministry. Now is an especially good time to imitate Him in being a light for others in these dark times~It's not about being perfect, it's about choosing good over evil.

            <hr/>
            <p>
             And finally, one of my favorite prayers, the Prayer of Saint Francis of Assisi, carried in the wallet of one of my favorite people, Chris Farley, Under the Title of "The Clown's Prayer", for many years;
            </p>
            <p>
             As I stumble through this life,
             <br/>
             help me to create more laughter than tears,
             <br/>
             dispense more happiness than gloom,
             <br/>
             spread more cheer than despair.
             <br/>
             Never let me become so indifferent
             <br/>
             that I will fail to see the wonder
             <br/>
             in the eyes of a child
             <br/>
             or the twinkle in the eyes of the aged.
             <br/>
             Never let me forget that my total effort
             <br/>
             is to cheer people, make them happy
             <br/>
             and forget - at least momentarily -
             <br/>
             all the unpleasantness in their lives.
             <br/>
             And, in my final moment,
             <br/>
             may I hear You whisper:
             <br/>
             'When you made My people smile,
             <br/>
             you made Me smile.'
            </p>
            <hr/>
            <p>
             Lord, make me an instrument of your peace,
             <br/>
             Where there is hatred, let me sow love;
             <br/>
             where there is injury, pardon;
             <br/>
             where there is doubt, faith;
             <br/>
             where there is despair, hope;
             <br/>
             where there is darkness, light;
             <br/>
             where there is sadness, joy;
            </p>
            <p>
             O Divine, grant that I may not so much seek to be consoled as to console;
             <br/>
             to be understood as to understand;
             <br/>
             to be loved as to love.
            </p>
            <p>
             For it is in giving that we receive;
             <br/>
             it is in pardoning that we are pardoned;
             <br/>
             and it is in dying that we are born to eternal life.

             whether they come from people who are religious, or the non-practicing, or those who are troubled or undecided, we all feel an intense need to expose this nightmare we've stumbled upon and feel a strong, spiritual sense of purpose that has brought us all together, from all over the World, to these forums where we work so hard to stop the Global horrors we've learned about and to free past, present &amp; current victims from their suffering.

             Daily, upon waking when my energy is at its strongest I pray and meditate in my head for at least half an hour that these children stay alive til rescue, they're scared so I pray for their strength and also their minds. I pray that someone suitable will be able to work these poor souls to some form of normal. I can't imagine they'll get to do the normal ever again. I'm even tearing up now..I have trauma issues with men yelling at me. Thinking of them just being yelled at fucking angers me. Violating them and the adults who are complicit make me see RED. I ask daily to save the children, for they're innocents. I do meditate upon all victims, but the little ones being tortured, and worse that breaks my heart. (Didn't know I even had one til PG honestly)

            I agree with you except on one point. There's no "we" by which you can justifiably have expectations or reference actions. People make their own choices. If someone goes out and actually finds evidence, "we" haven't done anything. They did something. I didn't do anything.

             This is where I have arrived. I belive ultimately Earth is God. What we live now, is Heaven, or Hell depending on choices made. You must be accountable for them. I look to the outdoors when I do pray or meditate. The sun is what I truly worship. It's bright light represents the good light we should seek. And the rains that come, they cleanse the earth, and therefore the earth will provide. Sometimes we get too much of these things, it's a test. Working together ensures this when a disaster happens. You carry on somewhere suitable, and carry on.
            </p>

             IMO, those involved here are already living Hell and I truly believe a great spirit, most high will stomp em right out.

            Question... I'm assuming for the whole 'synchronized' bit to work out the way I'm imagining it should, shouldn't there be a time zone included? Anyone know which one it is? I'm on Mountain Standard Time myself. Or is it meant to just be waves of positive vibes chaining together across the globe, time zone to time zone?

            and why meditate at 11:11am? this resembles the type of shit you see next to "NIBIRU IS COMING" and just makes rationalists like me cringe.

             I'd LOVE to go protest but I'd sure like bipartisan support with that. Which is why pulling together in prayer might give us the will. Protesting about pedobears would merely be overlooked until we have all extracted our heads from the sand, and realize this ain't even something we need be paid for. I'm working hard to get all sides into this, media makes the shit hard.
            </p>
            <p>
             If it comes to it I'd protest alone, I'm sure a forever alone protest would at least make social media rounds. Nobody says prayer is the only thing. We gotta discuss protests in our states, cause that's paid attention. Perhaps link them up too.

              Protests are worse than doing nothing. Why waste the effort begging someone else to solve a problem for me? Funny to watch people march around like a herd of animals though. Funny in that stupid and pathetic way.
             </p>
             <p>
              By protesting you present yourself as an opponent who's either illogical or violent (which is both), and this is intended for you to be taken seriously on the merit of your cause? It's dumb.

              Suppose someone came to you with a goal to climb a mountain. They detailed plans for you which were nonproductive, but also had some productive plans. If you told them the nonproductive plans will not help them achieve that goal, does that stop them from doing the productive things? I would say it does not and that it seems obvious. Almost as if it goes without saying.

            actually, i am spiritual. but i don't shoehorn it where it doesn't belong.

           <p>
            i'm just concerned because if i didn't see all the evidence for myself, i would take a few looks at this subreddit and assume you were all retarded.
           </p>
           <p>
            i don't mean to be offensive, but absolutely ridiculous posts get voted up regularly and it seems like nobody even cares whether the claim is true.

            they want to believe that "ARRESTS ARE IMMINENT!" and ignore the fact that the source is some guy on youtube with no credibility.
           </p>
           <p>
            there is no culture of fact-checking here, and that concerns me. the #1 thing we could do is get more people to take pizzagate seriously, and in that respect, 70% of the people here are the greatest impediment to that.

            how does any crime investigator do their job? if you can't look at a piece of evidence dispassionately, you are hurting the pizzagate cause.
           </p>
           <p>
            i'm someone who believe pizzagate is real and even i am constantly how people believe incredible shit with hardly any evidence.

             There are researchers and there are believers of Pizzagate. Some can't contribute as much in the research end. What harm is taking a few minutes on a Saturday and, instead of combing the internet feeling helpless, putting that mental energy into prayer or positive thoughts towards justice for the children? I don't believe one thread on prayer in this whole forum will cause anybody to think we are "retarded." JMO

              if it was just this thread, i wouldn't bother commenting.
             </p>
             <p>
              i feel like there's a campaign by members of this subreddit to appear as incredible as possible.
             </p>
             <p>
              and the sad part is that i don't necessarily believe that. i think people here let emotion take them over and the result is that they claim dumb shit with no evidence and nobody takes this place seriously.
             </p>
             <p>
              i'm not trying to be hostile, it's just so frustrating. it's not just us here guys, there are new people who look at these posts and immediately decide that we're all crazy and that pizzagate is BS.

            I CHING #43 Breakthrough: In a resolute struggle of the good against evil, there are, however, definite rules that must not be disregarded, if it is to succeed. First, Resolution must be based on a union of strength and friendliness. Second, a compromise with evil is not possible; evil must under all circumstances be openly discredited. Nor must our own passions and shortcomings be glossed over. Third, the struggle must not be carried on directly by force. If evil is branded, it thinks of weapons, and if we do it the favor of fighting against it blow for blow, we lose in the end because thus we ourselves get entangled in hatred and passion.

            this is the last thing we need right now. whatever your personal beliefs are, this investigation demands rationale dispassionate minds.

            Pray. Do good things.  We must all hold ourselves account in the end. Do righteous acts before you return to dust.  Prayer is important but we are living instruments to do good.  Good things are both big and small. Never be discouraged because the evil that is out there never tires. Never rests.

            Don't meditate for harm to come upon others. Doing so against even those that might deserve it (like pedophiles, for example) still is projecting negative energy upon another. You're literally meditating for negative energy to be put upon another when you do that and it makes you a beacon of darkness as you channel negative, dark energy through you when you think harmful thoughts upon another. This bounces the energy right back to you yourself and in the end creates more harm than good.
           </p>
           <p>
            What should be done instead is to meditate toward the empowering of those who are harmed by the pedophiles. In other words, don't meditate for harm to come on to others. Meditate instead for strength to come upon those who need it the most in order to fend off anyone who might try to harm them. Uplift and strengthen everyone who stands to be a victim. Meditate toward giving light and power to everyone who might be harmed by pedophilia and its perpetrators. Meditate to empower all people, groups, etc, that have the ability to shut down pedophiles. Meditate to give them the power and the strength and the courage to do their jobs and capture and turn in and imprison all pedophiles and people engaged in such activity
            <strong>
             Meditate to give communities aware of these things the power to stand up and put and end to this. Meditate to give all of us the power to stand up and put an end to this.
            </strong>
           </p>
           <p>
            <strong>
             In the end, you achieve the same effect of shutting down the darkness, but you do it by empowering the light against it, and you don't end up bringing in the darkness into your own sphere by wishing negativity and harm upon another.
            </strong>

             If you join, just meditate for justice as the organizer asks for that 22 minutes.  Then throw in empowerment afterwards or before if you like.  The idea is to keep the idea pure and true on a mass level.
            </p>
            <p>
             Don't let anyone divide the power of this idea, it is going viral.

              No, but under Jesus's following, justice is that which aligns with him/God. And seeking curses, death upon an individual is what turns you into a demon yourself. If you want justice, pray for protection. Pray for life for those who are harmed. And if you want those who are committing sins unto children to stop, pray for their actions to be revealed and let God be their judge.
             </p>
             <p>
              But make no mistake, stopping them, arresting them, or even execution can still be justice. Just do not seek it through malice.

            send love and healing energy. negative harmful prayers will amplify back to self in ways unforseen. Send prayers that this be resolved in the highest and best good for all. Give the investigators and officers prayers to be strong, firm and to see clearly the best way ahead. Send prayers to the relief of the children that they be saved and nurtured back to health and wellness. Send prayers for the light to overtake the darkness. See it as so.....

            Please keep this on the front page mods. I was not a big religious guy prior to Pizzagate, but after seeing what these sick, twisted people believe in, Im now 100% convinced there is supernatural good and evil in this world

             A message to the mods. This does
             <em>
              not deserve a sticky
             </em>
             .
             <br/>
             Because it's not directly pizzagate related...
            </p>
            <p>
             Before all you haterz step in... Am I allowed to say "Hey guys, I'm holding a party on my street to raise awareness - sticky this thread"? Nope. But stickying a thread with Homeopathic Pseudoscience is fine? Nope.
             <br/>
             I urge you NOT to sticky this. Not because you don't believe in it, but because it's DETRACTING from the issue.

              if gods were real, they'd strike down those who go out of their way to mock them. they wouldn't allow a system that protects those who cause irreparable harm to some of the most innocent, fragile beings. I wish I could believe though... it'd be nice and comforting knowing these people will all burn for eternity, but I'm not taking that chance. these people need to experience hell on earth and then die in misery for what they've done.

               Here are some nicely compiled summaries with verses cited. But there's an interesting correlation between Moloch and children prostitutes as well as the parents giving up their own children, killing them then burning them.

              <p>
               Did anyone else see the comment about the bands upstairs in CPP maybe drowning out the torture happening in the basement? There's an eerily similar reference in one of these links to the people playing flutes during the sacrifices to drown out the screams of the children. Yikes.

                This is awesome thank you for this. I am not religious but this is turning me to seek more knowledge... I did come across a video randomly and a dude says, ok you need a KJV but do NOT just go to the store and buy one. Your bible will find you lol.... Was looking online at bibles last night, cant ignore the coincidences that have been happening in my life lately... Again I am not a religious man simply a seeker of knowledge and we need to know what we are dealing with, understanding their deranged motives can helps. It helps us gain perspective on their actions and make it easier to call them out. Anyways thankyou.

                 Dude, you don't know how crazy this is! I'm an atheist turned Christian, and what you said about the crazy coincidences that happen in your life was one of the things that got my attention. And when you start praying and seeing things happen before your eyes, it's unbelievable. Whatever it is that you may be going through right now, I'll be praying for you, sir!

                 There you go, you just got a free Bible!
                </p>
                <p>
                 I've used the software for about 15 years and it's great. Easy to operate, very user friendly.

                <p>
                 I think God does call people, especially when the days grow evil.
                </p>
                <p>
                 The thing about God is that salvation is through His Son, Jesus Christ. He asks no money, no church joining, no bowing to a pope. Just a belief in His Son.
                </p>
                <p>
                 That's pretty cool if you ask me!
