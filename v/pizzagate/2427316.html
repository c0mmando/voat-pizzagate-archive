<p>It begins with Blind Item #5 from 18 February on the Crazy Days and Nights blog.  It reads as follows:</p>
<p>This foreign born A- list actor has had his best success in television. He will tell you though that his drug and alcohol abuse issues that have plagued him for two decades are the result of a movie. A movie which starred two actors who are now above him on the list. Both, also foreign born. The subject of our blind though says he had to have sex with multiple men to land the part. Our actor says he was raped three times by one of the producers of the movie during filming and that he was told he would never work again if he said anything. That producer is a permanent A- list singer.</p>

<p>The film which appears to perfectly fit the clues given in the B.I. is the 1998 movie <em>Velvet Goldmine</em>, with Irishman Jonathan Rhys Meyers as the A- list actor who has had his best success in television (The Tudors &amp; Dracula) with Scotsman Ewan McGregor &amp; Welshman Christian Bale as his co-stars who are above him on the list.  One of the executive producers of the movie was Michael Stipe of REM fame.  Other executive producers include Bob &amp; Harvey Weinstein who I daresay would\'ve had the clout to nip Meyers\'s fledgling career in the bud had they wanted.  The full cast &amp; crew can be found here:</p>

<p>The connection to Pizzagate is to be found in the fact that Stipe also acted as executive producer of the 2012 documentary <em>Me at the Zoo</em> with none other than James Alefantis as co-producer (please see below).</p>

<p>If this B.I. is true, it does seem that degenerates of a feather truly do flock together!  In any case, it is a 2nd degree connection between one of the men at the centre of the Pizzagate scandal and the man who has come to epitomise the cesspool that is Paedowood.</p>',

             Barely recognisable from the kid who shot Michael Collins (that was the first thing I saw him in).  Do these bastards ever think for a moment the long term harm they're doing to both children and adults when they force/pressure them to do these awful things?  Stupid question, I know!

             Yeah, I always liked him as an actor. The short interview with him in the video OP linked is really mind-boggling.
            </p>
            <p>
             Look at his face, how much he is shaken when he recalls what must have happened to him (although he isn't stating it in the interview.)

                 Ive read some epic threads over last few years re. how Princess Kate's parents online company (Party Pieces?) is/was a front for Carol Middleton's sketchy brother's (James Goldsmith?) drug and sex trafficking ring....
                </p>
                <p>
                 LMAO that their Party Pieces company supposedly made 30 million GPB in 1999 when NOBODY ANYWHERE really knew what the internet was, NEVER MIND
                 <em>
                  buying
                 </em>
                 shit on it!!! Apparently that money paid for Kate and siblings to go to a fancy school etc and learn the manners and etiquette to become future princesses LOL....Also why Carol forgives the brother for being a fat embarrassing sack of shit.

                  WowZerrini!!!  I never cared for Kate nor any of them for that matter.  I think that after the mistake of Diana they no longer are allowed to choose their own mates.  I think the fact that they were involved with trafficking Kate was the Perfect Choice.  Well, the fact that it is connected to Royals definitely connects it to the Elites and Pizzagate as long as you have enough facts and proof and links to add.   This will be a Slam Dunk!

              It is the link given in this submission, if you watch it you will see the connection. I already said the relevance, it has some of the pizzagate people ie JA  etc., watch it yourself and see.  I did not write the sub so I don't have to explain my relevance in a comment, even though I did if you had looked at the links that Podege512 had taken the time to share. - Why do you try to find fault when I post/comment? Just a genuine question.

                I do feel defensive, because you seem to say it like I have no relevance etc., I think it the name you chose, millennial_vulcan is too close to millenial_falcon who gave me and a few others a hard time. haha. Sorry, just thought you were being mean. Peace? 😏✋🏻

                   and others, that I think the subject matter of everything we post and talk about gets us riled up sometimes. I get a little crazy on the board sometimes because there is no other outlet for it in real life. Talk to friends and family about all this stuff? I would be a social pariah and committed to the Lunatic Asylum. It is hard :(

            I recommend watching the video you linked. It's a really good intro.
           </p>
           <p>
            Thank you for this post, I hadn't read the blind before.
           </p>
           <p>
            Actually, I had to walk away from my PC and take a deep breath after watching the video.
           </p>
           <p>
            J. Rhys Meyer, Ewan McGregor and Michael Stipe? That's almost more than I can take.  :-(
           </p>
           <p>
            I remember that Ewan McGregor did a film with Polanski, I think it was called 'The Ghostwriter'. McGregor played a ghostwriter who gets hired to write the autobiography of a politician, and then he is in danger because he finds out that Tony Blair was hired as a CIA asset when he was at Oxbridge (lol).
           </p>
           <p>
            So, there are hardly any former fav actors left on my list right now. Very sad.

             there was a huge backlash again McGregor after that Polanski movie. McGregor was gushing about how great Polanski was and got a shit ton of abuse for it, as most people know Polanski as major pedo. McGregor laid low for a while afterwards.
            </p>
            <p>
             McGregor also connected to Nicole Kidman from set of
             <em>
              Moulin Rouge
             </em>
             Well known in showbiz circles that Kidman aborted McGregor's baby.
