It is an enormous tragedy that this report has been ignored by our leaders.  We all know what the current situation is and the reasons for it.  The good people of Voat have spent countless months and hours researching and exposing the horrors that millions of our infants, toddlers, and adolescents have experienced and still are today. This report demonstrates that over the years, essentially NOTHING has been done to curtail sexual crimes against children.  As stated in one of my previous submission titles, &quot;This House of Cards Must Come Down.&quot;</p>
<p>I will provide only a fragment of the report\'s contents and emphasize that it needs to be read in its entirety.</p>
<p>NAMBLA and The Rene Guyon Society is discussed.  My recent post from yesterday partially focused on the latter.  
</p>
<p>p 16
&quot;The NAMBLA and The Rene Guyon Society is estimated to number 25,000.  Undercover officers and NAMBLA officials themselves have confirmed that its membership is only about 400 (can we trust &quot;undercover agents&quot; and &quot;NAMBLA officials?) and the Rene Guyon is widely known by most investigators as a one-man propaganda operation whose membership claims are not credible.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Organized pedophilia groups are the most serious threat when they serve as contact and support groups justifying pedophilia in the minds of their members and reinforcing within child molesters a belief that society, not the pedophile, is misguided.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It would be a mistake, however, to overemphasize the threat by these groups to the exclusion of the more numerous unorganized groups of child molesters that make no pretense of wanting to change legislation or to argue their case in public.  The largest and most dangerous child sex rings invariably have proven to be groups of friends and/or pen pals with no real organizational structure.&quot; </p>
<p>&quot;NAMBLA is by far the most active and sophisticated of the pro-pedophilia organizations in America.  It does not shy away from publicity.  Its members also tend to be well-educated professionals.&quot;</p>
<p>pp 29-30
&quot;Due to its inflammatory slogan - \'Sex Before Eight or Else It\'s Too Late\' - the Rene Guyon Society of Beverly Hills, CA, has become widely publicized in news articles about pedophiles.  Having taken its name from a French psychiatrist and associate of Sigmund Freud, the society claims 5,000 supporters, including psychiatrists, parents, and physicians.  But Detective William Dworkin of the LAPD told this subcommittee this is a wildly inflated figure, and the organization is probably little more than one flamboyant pedophile\'s attempt to gain national attention.  Dworkin said police surveillance of the group\'s eccentric leader, \'Tim O\'Hara,\' - whose real name is Jonathan Evan Edwards - indicates that he does not have regular contact with children and that the amount of correspondence he receives hardly seems indicative of an organization with 5,000 supporters (lame excuse).&quot; </p>
<p>&quot;Edwards, 64, strongly advocates sex with children and publishes an irregular newsletter endorsing anal and vaginal penetration of children as long as condoms are used.  \'We are composed of citizens who have never broken child sex laws even if never caught,\' said O\'Hara in a letter to the subcommittee on November 30, 1984.  \'We work for child sexual freedom if condoms are used for anal and vaginal penetration to age 18.  We work for kid pornography laws to make illegal any show of penetration oif the vagina or anus without a condom being shown used.\'  
</p>
<p>p 46
&quot;The American Christian Voice Foundation asserted in its 1985 publication,  \'Child Protection Alert that... police investigations are unearthing a thriving for-profit industry revolving around child pornography with sales estimated to run at least one-half billion dollars annually.\' (In 1985!!!)  Similar citizens groups and some writers have used terms like \'multi-billion-dollars\' to describe it.  The subcommittee, however, has found no evidence to support such figures.&quot;</p>
<p>p 44
Conclusions
&quot;Computers are pproviding pedophiles with a virtually unacceptable means of exchanging information, including the names of potential victims. While the subcommittee is mindful of the Constitutional safeguards against interference with free speech, a need clearly exists for additional legislation in this area.&quot;</p>
<p>Recommendations (a few)
&quot;Following news media accounts of these public hearings, several thousand postcards and letters were received, urging Congress to take a tougher stand on child pornography.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Ban advertising of child porn and child prostitution.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Senate Bill 2398 was introduced which would prohibit any advertisement \'to receive, exchange, trade, buy, produce, display, disseminate, photograph, film, print, or record any visual or print medium depicting sexually explicit conduct with any minor....  In addition, this bill amends the Mann Act which prohibits the interstate transportation of females for the purpose of prostitution to include males . \'</p>
<p>&quot;Increase pressure on foreign pornographers.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Create regional child sexual exploitation task forces.  It became apparent that there is an immediate need for a mechanism to promote the sharing and dissemmination of intelligence on child sex crime suspects and to coordinate joint criminal investogationns.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Poor communication and \'turf\' rivalries do occur.  Establish a network of regional task forces, controlled on the local, state, and federal levels, including representation from the US Postal Office, US Customs Service, Justice Department, and the FBI.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Conduct \'proactive investigations and not just respond to crises as they occur.&quot;</p>
<p>We can only hang on to hope and pray.</p>
