             Moderator millienial falcon just deleted my OP. Said I violated rule 1, even though my OP states this is related to children and human trafficking. Voat is infiltrated by moderators attempting to Kill this discussion and nothing of real investigative work being done here anymore. With their technicalities and narrow focus on comet ping pong they stifle the greater pedogate child killing argument. This place is not worth energy and time. Maybe a wordpress page is the better way to go.

             In a move which could help Allergan PLC (AGN) drive future growth, the company announced it is purchasing
             <strong>
              LifeCell
             </strong>
             for $2.9 billion in cash.
             <strong>
              <strong>
               LifeCell
              </strong>
              is a unit of privately held Acelity and focuses on regenerative medicine tissue products
             </strong>
             , which could fit in nicely with Allergan's plastic surgical unit and other cosmetic products.
            </p>
            <p>
             Following the deal announcement, Sanford C. Bernstein &amp; Company analyst Aaron Gal said he sees the acquisition as synergistic and feels it was completed at a reasonable price. The analyst reiterated his "outperform" rating and $275 per share price. Additionally, Deutsche Bank maintained its coverage of AGN with a "buy" and $247 per share price target. Meanwhile, Bank of America/Merrill Lynch also maintained their "buy" rating and $280 per share price target.
            </p>
            <p>
             According to Tipranks, the average analyst price target for Allergan is about $278 and carries an average rating of "strong buy." Currently, 16 analysts are tracking the stock, with the highest price target being $400 by Cowen Group and the lowest price target at $209 by William Blair. The top rated analyst on the website is Mizuho Bank, which carries a 5 out of 5-star rating, and has a "buy" rating and $293 price target. Shares of AGN closed on December 20th, at $191.33, which is nearly 31% below the average price target of $278. Analysts, like most long shareholders of AGN on Wall Street, have not had a good year, with shares down nearly 38%.
            </p>
            <p>
             After a rough 2016, shares of Allergan have stabilized around $192, although the market has found no catalyst thus far to push the stock price up, or down for that matter. Although I do not possess a crystal ball that allows me to see into the future, I'm quite confident the current price of $192 is not likely where the stock is staying. If anything, this seems like a resting place for the stock while the market waits for a new piece of news to come. Once it does, I'd expect volatility to pick up again. Levels to watch, are around $190 and $195 with a break above or below those levels to decide the future direction of the stock.

            internal quality processes raised questions about the donor documentation received from a tissue recovery organization called
            <strong>
             Biomedical Tissue Services (BTS).
            </strong>
            According to reports, there had been allegations that BTS was harvesting tissue from cadavers without first obtaining the proper documentation.

             **Who is Michael Mastromarino? What are his connections? **
            </p>
            <p>
             In late 2005, the New York City Police Department investigated Michael Mastromarino and his company BTS for allegedly selling stolen human body parts.[4] The probe was first reported by the New York Daily News in October 2005, and led to a number of exhumations, including one of a Queens, New York, woman who had had many of her bones removed and replaced with PVC piping, which is a typical industry practice for cosmetic reconstruction of tissue donors.[citation needed] According to government witnesses, BTS sought business relationships with a number of funeral homes in New York and Pennsylvania solely to obtain access to recently deceased people, often paying the funeral homes $1,000 or more per corpse.[2] In nearly every case, BTS employees obtained human allograft tissue, bones, ligaments and other cadaver material by forging family consent and other donor forms without actual authorized consent, and often against the written wishes of families. BTS employees engaged in highly irregular and unsafe practices, such as allowing cadavers to deteriorate before collecting tissue and parts, not testing donor material for diseases such as HIV/AIDS, and even accepting cancerous and other diseased cadavers for harvesting and selling. Under federal regulatory guidelines for the proper care and management of donated human tissue, firms are required to "screen and test donors for relevant communicable disease agents and diseases and to ensure that HCT/Ps are processed in a way that prevents communicable disease contamination and cross-contamination."[5]
            </p>
            <p>
             To conceal their practices, BTS employees forged a variety of the necessary certificates and even, as in the case of an exhumed Queens woman, replaced bone with PVC piping to fool family members of the deceased.[1] Of the numerous companies who purchased the illegally obtained body parts, or tissue, none had ever contacted the family member listed on the deceased consent forms to verify the consent, or even that the consenting person listed actually existed. The BTS scandal became international news after it was determined that the remains of the deceased broadcaster Alistair Cooke, were among those that had been violated and sold in New York.[6][7][8]

             In February 2006, Michael Mastromarino,[9] then a 42-year-old[10] former New Jersey-based oral surgeon and CEO and executive director of operations of BTS,[5] was convicted along with three employees of wrongdoing and sentenced to prison terms. Mastromarino and Lee Cruceta, one of the convicted employees, agreed to a deal that resulted in their imprisonment.[3] Mastromarino was sentenced on June 27, 2008 in the Supreme Court in Brooklyn, New York, to between 18 and 54 years in prison.[11] Director Toby Dye made the documentary Body Snatcher of New York about this case in 2010.[12]

             On September 4, 2008, defense attorneys for human graft tissue distributors asked U.S. District Judge William J. Martini to dismiss hundreds of charges, asserting that the companies "never knew the body parts were illegally obtained, and they say there is no evidence the transplanted tissue made anyone ill."[13]
            </p>
            <p>
             According to the FDA, all tissue products collected and distributed by BTS were recalled and will be monitored for a complete accounting of all graft material.[5] BTS sold its products to five companies; two of the companies were Life Cell Corporation, of New Jersey, and Regeneration Technologies, of Florida. Overall, about 10,000 patients in the United States and Canada received graft tissue from BTS.[10]
            </p>
            <p>
             BTS was not an accredited member, nor did the company ever apply to be a member, of the American Association of Tissue Banks. Robert Rigney, who heads the association, said he doubts anyone who received tissue donations originating from the company is in any kind of health danger, because the processors the company dealt with would have subjected the tissues to their own screening processes.[14]
            </p>
            <p>
             However, transplant patient Betty Pfaff was one person who suffered severe infection, septic shock, underwent dialysis and ultimately paralysis due to having received an implant made from infected cadaver tissue from Mastromarino's company.[citation needed] Although a recent judicial ruling has increased the difficulty of patients in proving pain and suffering from receiving bad donor tissue in cases like these, Pfaff’s lawsuit is still pending.[citation needed]
            </p>
            <p>
             Other patients who received BTS-derived tissue and body parts include a Colorado woman who had to repeat her ACL replacement surgery after her first BTS tendon failed, an Ohio woman who developed syphilis after receiving a bone from BTS, and an Ohio man who developed both HIV and hepatitis C after receiving BTS bone implants in surgery.[15]
            </p>
            <p>
             On January 8, 2010, Michael Mastromarino's now ex-wife Barbra Mastromarino appeared on The Oprah Winfrey Show in a segment "Husbands' Secret Lives" [16] and discussed the effect of the actions on her life and their sons' lives. After confronting his father about the reasons for his crimes while Dr. Mastromarino was incarcerated at Rikers Island, their older son subsequently refused to speak to his father. During the broadcast, Barbra Mastromarino also listened to and apologized to the daughter of a victim of her husband's crimes, while mentioning she had no knowledge of her husband's illegal acts. Barbra Mastromarino acknowledged ignoring warning signs about the character of her ex-husband early in their relationship.
            </p>
            <p>
             On the morning of July 7, 2013, Michael Mastromarino died at St. Luke's Hospital after suffering from bone cancer.[17] He was 49.

              Brothers Louis and Gerald Garzone provided bodies from a pair of funeral homes and a crematorium they ran in Philadelphia to Mastromarino. They are currently serving between eight and 20 years.
Mastromarino paid the Garzones for at least 244 corpses that were carved up without families' permission and without-medical tests, prosecutors said.
Skin, bones, tendons and other parts, some of them diseased, were then sold around the country for dental implants, knee and hip replacements and other procedures. The tissue stolen from a single body often fetched about $4,000.
Biomedical Tissue Services, which was owned by Mastromarino, shipped the body parts to Regeneration Technologies, LifeCell Corp, Tutogen Medical Inc and two non-profit organisations, Lost Mountain Tissue Bank and Tissue Centre of Central Texas.
