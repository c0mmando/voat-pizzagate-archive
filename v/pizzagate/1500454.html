I do know I have researched Mellow Mushroom Pizza for weeks and it had too many coincidences going on.  Today someone pointed out that Andrew J. Kline represents numerous clients and I looked at the doc and lo and behold was Doughboys, which is under the Mellow Mushroom <a href="https://sli.mg/user/i/edit/?i=9WOhWR">https://sli.mg/user/i/edit/?i=9WOhWR</a>.  It is owned by Pooja and Amit Mehta whom are brothers in DC as well as a location in VA.  Another owner I believe is James Allen.  Pooja is a doctor and Amit is a judge. One of the charities they are tied to is Miriam\'s Kitchen in DC.  This non-profit deals with homeless people, poor mothers and children in DC.  Seems to be quite successful and has had photo ops at WH with FLOTUS.  The owner Susan Keeler also started in the Congo I believe late \'90s with homeless children. She became attached to a poor child at six mons old and eventually her parents died. Keeler was able to adopt little Miriam and then started Miriam\'s Mission in the Congo. I believe it is still viable today.  When you visit Miriam\'s Kitchen website you see at bottom her sponsors, which include Bank of America and Boeing. These two are heavy donors to Clinton Foundation/Clinton Global Initiative. In addition, another sponsor is American Beverage Association, which CEO is Susan Neely.  There is a Susan Neely, (Assistant Secretary to DHS) in Wikileaks (prior to Podesta leaks) associated in email with an Ambassor Sobel to Belgium I believe.  She is the same person. Also another sponsor/donor to CF is American Financial Services, which used to be American Express Financial. Obviously, just because they are sponsors to Miriam\'s Kitchen and donors to CF could be meaningless to anything else. </p>
<p>The owners of the corporate Mellow Mushroom Pizza are Marc Weinstein and Mike Nicholson. They founded MMP in 974 in Atlanta, GA. They franchise to individual owner/operators all the locations shown below except one that I am aware of in Round Rock, TX.  I believe is corporate owned and operated. </p>
<p><a href="https://sli.mg/user/i/edit/?i=71xFkA">https://sli.mg/user/i/edit/?i=71xFkA</a> This a map identifying all there locations. It might not be up-to-date info.</p>
<p><a href="https://sli.mg/user/i/edit/?i=mLqnlj">https://sli.mg/user/i/edit/?i=mLqnlj</a> This is the backdrop to the corporate office webpage, houseofshroom.com. Please note that it has an Alice In Wonderland theme.  I think they came up with their company logo of the mushroom based on the Lewis Carroll story where Alice eats the mushroom to become small and grow bigger.  It is the white rabbit, Mad Hatter, who tells her how to shrink in size.  Note the pic the white rabbit. and the white doves, which CPP had in some of their Majestic Ape concert posters.   Also, note the b&amp;w checkerboard flooring and b&amp;w skirt Alice is wearing.  There is the time piece which the Mad Hatter carried and the floating pizza slice. What I find the weirdest thing is the drink floating in the pic.  Is this to imply something like spirit cooking, i.e., semen, menstrual blood and breast milk that supposedly they drink?  Seems odd just floating out there in space.</p>
<p>The following are clothing they offer on their website:
<a href="https://sli.mg/user/i/edit/?i=vLk3ao">https://sli.mg/user/i/edit/?i=vLk3ao</a> It has been noted swirls in eyeglasses is a pedo symbol.</p>
<p>Here are more of what they offer.  Note the colored handkerchiefs, SliceSlice Baby t-shirt, Eye socks, etc <a href="https://sli.mg/user/i/edit/?i=TdBBST">https://sli.mg/user/i/edit/?i=TdBBST</a>
This a t-shirt they sell that has the owl, pink and blue pedo swirls, and the eye that always seems to be punctured in a lot of occult pics.  I think it is to imply like thru MKUltra you can see into the soul through this eye or something like that.  Could be wrong about meaning. <a href="https://sli.mg/user/i/edit/?i=hW7fwX">https://sli.mg/user/i/edit/?i=hW7fwX</a></p>
<p>This is the pizza box they use.  It has a mushroom with little mushrooms almost in a daisy chain and the mushroom is thruster backwards as if something sexual is happening. <a href="https://sli.mg/user/i/edit/?i=9WOhWR">https://sli.mg/user/i/edit/?i=9WOhWR</a></p>
<p>When you read their &quot;Privacy&quot; link under the site it goes into great detail about privacy. Stating &quot;Your personal information is contained behind secure networks and is only accessible by a limited number of persons who have special access rights to such systems and are required to keep the information confidential.&quot; Sounds very secret and secure, but maybe I am reading too much into all of this! Also, there is a section which tells you what billing name will appear  on your credit card statement in case you are wondering. That sounds to me like something a strip club would tell you so its name doesnt show up as Pussy Club Strip Bar or something! Again, maybe I am letting my imagination get the best of me!   Now this corporate MMP is affiliated with a non-profit named Share The Strength, which is owned by Bill And Debbie Shore, Wash. DC. They also have under this umbrella &quot;No Kid Hungry&quot;.  Share the Strength is a donor to CGI. </p>
<p>I went to various MMP sites in various states.  I looked at lots of pics through each Yelp site. One viewer commented on the bizarre artwork in the restaurant. Here is a sampling of pics from I believe Round Rock TX MMP, which is located just outside of Austin. <a href="https://sli.mg/user/i/edit/?i=n6RVtE">https://sli.mg/user/i/edit/?i=n6RVtE</a> This pic was a large wall mural. Note in pic the owl in the boat, fish lying outside the boat, devil horns around border of pic, crescent moon, the eyes, large sun and two white rabbits. This next pic shows a t-shirt or sign hanging in the restaurant with pizza slice named &quot;Muliminati&quot;.</p>
<p><a href="https://sli.mg/YPfjL4">https://sli.mg/YPfjL4</a> another pic show the pedo sign in hand gesture of left hand of woman, spiral glasses of man and if you look at woman\'s  dress it has outline of Flintstone character.  Hanna Barra Flintstone movie 
made in 1965 was said to have implied pedophilia content.  
</p>
<p>There are more  pics of these MMPs on Yelp.  I know some of the other locations I looked at did seem to be completely innocuous of any symbols.  
</p>
<p>One other comment on Share the Strength is a charity rating services on the internet gave them two stars out of four for transparency, etc. I can\'t find it right now. </p>
<p>I am not really good with this cut and paste and archiving, but I think I did archive all of this.  I don\'t know how to find it now.  I guess you can google it on archive.is and it will pop up.  Also, there was someone from Germany on here the other day and was making comments about Twitter sites with pedo symbols and something about porkchops symbols meaning cannibals, etc. I can\'t find post on Voat, but one he mentioned was mellow_ville or something like that.  I had saw this Twitter site earlier in my research and it is tied to Mellow Mushroom Pizza place somewhere and somehow. I did not know anything about pork chops or cannibalism stuff.  People might to research all I found bc I am sure there is plenty I have not found.</p>',

            I've been involved with several Mellow Mushrooms and there certainly wasn't anything nefarious afoot at any that I've worked at. I think think this is simply a groovy college-town-originating pizzeria. I can't speak for their involvement with questionable charities, but  I will say this: Mellow isn't doing well because it's got some other business going on the side, but because it's seriously one of the best pizza places around and has an awesome atmosphere.

            The bandanas are what the cooks wear on their head. There were no basements.

            Thank you for your help. I click open on link and it takes me to Sli.mg.  I see the Direct URL you typed, but when I try to copy into my post the original hyper link does not disappear and nothing happens.  I went back again into Sli and I noted a little voat icon. When I click on it it makes a whole new post with the pic opening directly into a post.  I deleted that one quickly! I am trying to figure this out.

             Weeks back someone on here made a comment in a unrelated post about something else that Mellow Mushroom looked a bit strange or something like that and that was it.  I decided to look and see what person might have been saying.

            Lewis Carroll, I've only known for a few weeks, is a legend in the pedo community.  Lewis Carroll and his works are a sort of pedo code as well.  Of course not always, being one of the giants of literature.  Carroll 'befriended' little girls, but lost interest as they reached puberty.
