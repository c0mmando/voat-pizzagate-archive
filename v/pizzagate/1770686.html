            , just because you add an arbitrary link, your post doesn't automatically become a sourced, investigative post. This is more of an unsourced discussion post that is better suited for

             /v/pizzagatewhatever

            Yes, very likely, cause some anonymous shill on voat said so, right? That's why he ran the operation basically from his boys room in the beginning. That's why he's so hated (just like Trump) and can barely be mentioned by name by the corporate media. It's because he's a sell out. sure...
           </p>
           <p>
            Before bashing AJ, you go out there with your full name. Risk your life and the life of your family (if you even have any) and see how easy it is. People bashing AJ and other prominent leaders are either shills or acting like shills without getting paid (not very intelligent).
           </p>
           <p>
            It's about seeding doubt and creating division and infighting, diverting attention away from the real issues and the cause. You achieve nothing else by doing it.
           </p>

            Go walk the walk, instead of whimping around on an anon forum acting like you know it all...

            And what if it is the other way round! What if in fact CCP is the real tangible thing - opening fissure so to speak from which deep hidden lava of pedogate ozzes from, one of many pores of the monster through which it leaks. And It is a lead that is off lmits, a lead that can actually lead to real investigation which comes witb it's own risk - Monica Petersen, Max Piers .....? So, hacks like Alex Jones, Cernovic and co are trying to turn us away from actually examining the lava oozing from a fissure and are trying to coax us at looking at the smoke from distant craters that may or may not errupt. Distant volcano domes may look more impressive but they are far less accessible for ordinary folk. CCP &amp; JA and its network of creepos is the lead through which evil doings of the elite can be exposed. What Alex Jones and the like are engaged in is nothing short of a classic diversion. The door is ajar, but they want us to enter the house by climbing through the window.

            AJ is one guy who built himself up from nothing and a veteran in this. All those bashing him are either shills or ppl looking for a "perfect leader" which does not exist. Get the fuck over it. He is ONE GUY. You go out there and follow his act and do it better then, if it's "easy money" as many claim.
           </p>
           <p>
            Alex called the "pizzagate trap" before anyone, and stopped focusing on the media trap. Yes, voaters etc. know that Pizzagate has a lot broader meaning, but many normal ppl don't. It's just a word anyway, and one solution I see more and more is using Pizzagate/Pedogate as the "brand" instead of just pizzagate alone.
           </p>
           <p>
            Alex Jones has made bombshell interviews exposing Pedogate lately, and still people who do nothing but create diversion keep bashing him. He donated 100K to this Army Vet who has a whole network of high level people going after this issue. What have you bashers done lately except complaining about how much AJ makes to fund his operation?
           </p>
           <p>
            Stop looking for the perfect fucking "christed leader" and be it yourself instead if you think you can... I think you will find that going through what AJ has done is fucking harder than writing a few anonymous post on a forum...

             Forget the pizzagate, he backtracked from Sandy Hook, and did not even cover the latest Londod 'attack' - 322 Skull&amp;Bones Masonic hoax. He should join Fox&amp;Friends!

             Yeah I absolutely agree people need to do what he's doing but better. He should be respected for speaking the truth on so many issues, but that doesn't mean that he can't be a gatekeeper on other issues, and thus helping to control the narrative. He has been the tip of the spear of the resistance to this whole evil cabal, so obviously that puts him in the spotlight, and he should be criticised if he does something wrong. I mean, he's not the christed leader, so he can be criticised and should be criticised, he's just a man, so you get over it. Anyway, the biggest areas he is gatekeeping on, is obviously the jewish question, he never brings up the fact that ethnic jews played the main role in 9/11, their role in the media and so forth and so on. Infowars even posted recently some article how "God is going to take revenge on America if they don't support Israel"... so this is literally the level of zionism going on there. So he's definitely not the leader of the resistance anymore, just a Trump administration propagandist, while billions and billions are being pumped in to the military industrial complex. So yes, we definitely need new leaders and people rising up to speak out about this. It's just that Alex has been saying oh how bad he wants to defeat the NWO, and he has the platform and the resources to blow this kind of stuff wide open, (like showing the neutral information on pizzagate for example, and let his audience come to their own conclusions instead of gatekeeping and saying it's disinfo), yet he doesn't do it so it tells us that he's compromised. In many cases he's the enemy of my enemy so he's my friend, but really he's becoming quite the despicable snake oil salesman propping up the military industrial complex and the oligarchy he once pretended to fight against. So, it's a typical Citizen Kane type story there. Guy built a media empire and became corrupted. He'll probably end up in a mansion somewhere, reminiscing on the innocent days of his youth lol.

              It's called pickng your battles OK. You go out there with your full name and see how easy it is. See how easy it was 20 years ago when "no one" knew shit. The problem is not with any ethnicity.

              AJ is a leader a million times more than any anonymous basher. He reaches millions each day. Go out there and become the leader you want him to be and stop creating division by bashing people who are doing more for this cause every day than you will do your entire life.

            Yes, I'm going to tell all you fucktards that consistently lick Alex Jones balls that he's become a very rich man thanks to loyal listeners like yourselves. I used to be one of you, but then I heard he was going to appear on Pierce Morgan, and I thought this is going to be a blood bath. Finally someone who is really smart and could wake the whole country up is going to be on national TV. Well, I knew it was too good to be true, between mocking Pierce Morgan's British accent and threatening to beat him up, I think the message was lost. Let me tell you a little secret about who owns CNN, Time Warner this is an ENTERTAINMENT company guys that's what they provide us, movies and channels on TV like CNN which masquerades as news. Lookup the video of one of Jones Jew handler employees trying to drive through a lot when he is stopped and asked for identification, well if you pay attention the security guard says you work for "Time Warner" because his ID showed that. There is a lot of circumstantial evidence that verifies as the very least something strange is going on with this whole Pizzagate idea. Instagram photos from many including the person AJ so tightly apologized to are weird! Some of these people have half naked kids with really strange conments. That's the issue! And that FAT RICH FUCK doesn't DARE mention it ONCE. This guy is an actor folks, and you know what he doesn't mean anything he says. He delivers is as a cartoon character might, he interrupts anyone who has anything to say, and you know the saddest part? He hates his fans. He thinks he's hot shit and you're all a bunch of gullible dimwits who are so STUPID they defend his dismissal of PG THE DAY BEFORE THE PROTEST. People on the way turned around and went the other way after this windbag said that. He is probably Bill Hicks, there is more evidence that suggests Alex Jones is Bill HIcks than a Pizzagate being real. So I'm just saying if you are going to listen to him, although I wouldn't recommend it, understand that this is the equivalent to watching CNN. It's just designed for right wing conspiracy nuts verses Democrats. Once you "wake up" to the fact you are chasing your tail listening to Alex Jones then you can truly begin your journey toward being "woke."

             I remember that Pierce Morgan interview and AJ put on his best nutcase performance. He mixes truth with bullshit. And he is not innocent, he is just another media front that is part of a controlled narrative. If he helped you wake up, then fine, but he's not a hero.
