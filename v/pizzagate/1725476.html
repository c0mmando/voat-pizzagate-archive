            The clip of the pillow talk is odd but not to be taken seriously.

            The part with Glenn is interesting. I always assumed it was to show just how child like Betty was. She is forced into the role of wife and ist her career as an aspiring model/actress and instead is the bored lonely housewife. The only time I remember her being truly happy was at the Hilton getting hit on by random Italian guys and even then she was playing the role of American lady tourist. She has a jealousy to her with her daughter in regard to her having a shot at being everything she wanted to be but the girl, sorry I forgot her name, rejects it for teenage rebellion.

            With glenn, she is looking for a friend while he is looking for a parent. She sees that his mother is not being attentive and reflects how how inattentive she is as a parent and talks about letting the nanny/housekeeper go but her husband says they have to keep up appearances. Every day for her is acting the role of the doting housewife but she is too child like to understand what that really means. She is not a pedo she is a lost child. Just look at her second husband. As much as Glenn is looking for a mother, Birdy was looking for a father.

             It was heavy handed. I remember thinking it was so weird when she gave the kid her hair, once they went there I had a feeling things would go farther than they did on the show, thankfully they dialed it back somewhat, I think that was the peak strange on that part of the show unless I overlooked some things...
