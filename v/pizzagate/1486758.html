<p>I think the Elite live off of suffering and pain. It does give them “power”.

<p>This whole Pizzagate/Donald Trump anti-establishment push is terrifying the shit out of them. 9/11, Boston Bombing, Sandy Hook, etc, did not terrify them this much.</p>
<p>Why? Because they could dismiss people talking about false flags as “crazy conspiracy theorists.” How could a government commit murder against its own people and plunge them into a costly foreign intervention? That is their plausible deniability, and it works pretty well. A lot of people I know would be horrified to learn that I believe 9/11 was an inside job and a ritualistic mass sacrifice.</p>
<p>But the pedophilia, and human trafficking is much more plausible to a majority of people. Why? Because pedophilia has become an epidemic among the Catholic Church, and the authorities have tended to cover it up.

And they remember the Franklin Scandal, and other pedophile rings exposed around the globe.</p>
<p>Pedophilia and human trafficking are not partisan issues. They are human issues.</p>
<p>Despite our positions on abortion or health insurance, we all agree that child rape is wrong, and institutionalized trafficking is heinous. We can all come together as a human society to research and take the stand that we will fight these sick and demented fucks with all of our might.</p>
<p>This terrifies them on another level: no longer to they have the power to alienate us from one another. They can’t divide Democrats and Republicans on a photo of a toddler strapped down– anyone would see that photo and immediately be disgusted.</p>
<p>Our community is a positive thing. It brings us together to share, critique and help one another on this journey of painful discovery. This community of rebels and seers is being attacked on many fronts, as we see on a daily basis. But they are very desperate.</p>
<p>So they throw the “fake news” meme which means nothing. “Conspiracy theory” doesn\'t have the punch it used to. Their entire credibility was lost when they said a day before the election that Hitlery had a 90% chance of winning. They are losing control of the narrative. They are losing control of the interwebs. They no longer have the monopoly on truth in the age of information.</p>
<p>Despite the insanely twisted and horrifying stuff we are encountering, we need to be strong and remember we have each other and we can do this. We can take them down. I know it seems impossible – but it will be impossible if we don’t think we can. We need to intent the world we want to inhabit and fight like hell. Who knows what that world will look like. But I want it to be a world where the truth is revealed to everyone, and not just the rebels under the fold.</p>

            I think you are giving them too much credit. Basically, all of them are psychopathic personalities that thrive amongst others like them, form groups so they can operate safely. They enjoy what they do because it reaffirms their belief that they are superior beings and the rest of us are cattle. I dont think they give a lot of thought to it as they've been doing it for centuries. Psychopaths always flock together in order to continue doing what they do.

            OK, so the muscles in someones arm are bad because they choose to punch an innocent victim in the face? It is the intention behind power, not power itself. I don't see how your posts line up because there are positive thought forms too. The muse for instance.

Sorry, didn't in any way intend to suggest you were an ignoramus, on the contrary, I was posting as a preemptive measure towards those who get hung up on terminology and miss the underlying meaning. I thought your comment was spot on.

            @ Expose the criminals. Unfortunately, when we use loaded phrases like demons, spirits etc. It can take people away from their mundayne expression, the nuts and bolts world that we see around us. I can understand  when people say it detracts from the issue, and yes it maybe can. But for those who are looking for the source of this problem. It may help to at least do a little studying on the history of archetypes, their influence,  and the reverence held of them (good and bad).

            Thanks so much for the feedback! I love writing but I feel like until recently I haven't been compelled to share my view with the world. Now I want to be an independent journalist, so it makes me happy to hear that.

            You're spot on. You mentioned the occult aspect, and since it is one that is rarely understood it leads people to dismiss it, but it is real. Just like "dark matter" there are levels to this universe that go unseen by the five senses. In themselves they are neither good nor bad, but like any source of power it can be used for either. The defining factor? Power used for the good, and understanding of all, verses power used for the reinforcement of the individual ego. The universe is one consciousness experiencing itself subjectivity as bill hicks said. With this in mind those who focus on the abuse of others for individual power are lost souls indeed, for they are ultimately abusing themselves.

              Some people have no sense of humour, he was also very self deprecating and plenty of self empowered women dig him (like my wife)... We are living in a time of potential neo-puritanism.

            There is a term I came across several years ago that fits... "Anti-Hominid". we are dealing with a organization of predators that are hunting humans, capturing humans, mentally branding them to fit the work they want them to do, and selling them. Wholesale. It is the last perverted rung on the so-called food chain. This is obviously not a red or blue issue, it is a human issue. Are we, as a species, being subject to systematic infanticide, homicide, and even genocide by members of our own species that see hominids as objects, food even? are we seeing a glimpse of this anti-hominid culture?
           </p>
           <p>
            It really is a terrible thought to consider. but the biggest picture does not need to be defined to realize the little we are seeing is absolutely horrific and must be fought against in a systematic and rational manner, by all of us.
