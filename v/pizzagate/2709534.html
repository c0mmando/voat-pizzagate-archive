<h2>The letter confirms that the Holy See received information in 2000 about the sexual misconduct of now-resigned U.S. Cardinal Theodore McCarrick</h2>
<h2>The letter lends credibility to bombshell accusations of a cover-up at the highest echelons of the Catholic Church, including Pope John Paul II and Pope Benedict VI</h2>
<p><em>from <a href="http://archive.is/RaUbj:">The Daily Mail</a></em></p>
<p>\'A 2006 letter from a top Vatican official confirms that the Holy See received information in 2000 about the sexual misconduct of now-resigned U.S. cardinal, lending credibility to bombshell accusations of a cover-up at the highest echelons of the Roman Catholic Church.</p>
<p>Catholic News Service, the news agency of the U.S. bishops\' conference, published the letter Friday from then-Archbishop Leonardo Sandri to the Rev. Boniface Ramsay, a New York priest who made the initial allegation.</p>
<p>Ramsay informed the Vatican in a November 2000 letter about then Cardinal Theodore McCarrick\'s misconduct with seminarians from Seton Hall University\'s Immaculate Conception Seminary. </p>
<p>Ramsay, who in 2000 was on the faculty at the seminary, has said he sent the letter at the request of the then-Vatican ambassador because he had heard so many complaints from seminarians that McCarrick would invite them to his beach house and into his bed.

<p>A 2006 letter from Cardinal Leonardo Sandri, a top Vatican official confirms that the Holy See received information in 2000 about the sexual misconduct of Cardinal Theodore McCarrick</p>
<p>Sandri, now a top-ranked Vatican cardinal who was the No. 3 in the Vatican\'s secretariat of state at the time, wrote Ramsay on October 11, 2006, seeking his recommendation for a former seminarian for a Vatican job.</p>
<p>In it, he referred to Ramsay\'s 2000 letter, saying: \'I ask with particular reference to the serious matters involving some of the students of the Immaculate Conception Seminary, which in November 2000 you were good enough to bring confidentially to the attention of the then-Apostolic Nuncio in the United States, the late Archbishop Gabriel Montalvo.\'</p>
<p>Archbishop Carlo Maria Vigano, at the center of a storm rocking Pope Francis\' papacy, cited Ramsay\'s 2000 letter in his own expose of a cover-up about the McCarrick affair. </p>
<p>He named Sandri among a long list of Vatican officials who knew about McCarrick\'s penchant for seminarians. </p>
<p>A 2006 letter from Cardinal Leonardo Sandri, a top Vatican official, pictured, confirms that the Holy See received information in 2000 about the sexual misconduct of McCarrick</p>
<p>Vigano also accused Francis <strong>of knowing in 2013 of McCarrick\'s misconduct but of rehabilitating him from sanctions</strong> purportedly imposed by Pope Benedict XVI.</p>
<p>Sandri\'s letter is significant because it corroborates Ramsay\'s story as well as Vigano\'s claims. It shows the Vatican knew about allegations against McCarrick in 2000, <strong>a year before St. John Paul II made him a cardinal. And it further implicates the Benedict\'s papacy for failing to take action against McCarrick for years even as more allegations against him arrived.</strong></p>
<p>Vigano says Benedict eventually imposed some form of sanction on McCarrick in 2009 or 2010, <strong>nearly a decade after Ramsay\'s letter arrived.</strong> </p>
<p>The fact that Sandri cited it so readily suggests it wasn\'t lost in a pile of unread mail somewhere, but was relevant even for a simple job reference.</p>
<p>Significantly, Sandri appeared more concerned about the sexual purity of the seminarian-candidate than that McCarrick might have sexually abused or harassed him, or abused his power over him.</p>
<p>In July, Pope Francis accepted the resignation of Cardinal McCarrick, the former archbishop of Washington, from the College of Cardinals, ordering him to a \'life of prayer and penance\'</p>
<p><strong>McCarrick resigned as a cardinal in July after a U.S. church investigation determined an accusation that he groped a teen-age altar boy in the 1970s was credible.</strong> </p>
<p>Since then several seminarians have come forward to say he routinely bedded them, or harassed them when they refused.\'</p>
<h2><strong>TL;DR: All three recent Popes had their part in the cover-up of McCarrick\'s crimes.</strong></h2>

             I still don't see why so many people believe that Jews are the cause of the world's problems. If the elite really practiced Judaism, they would not be doing those abominations....it's like saying Catholics make all Christians suspect. Also, I think the Catholic church has always been like this, they were not infiltrated by Jews.....the leaders have been in league with bad forces. But really, who knows for sure I could be wrong.

               My father freaked out when I told him what I was researching and what my thoughts were. Then I freaked out. It wasn't great.
But I really believe he's still "bluepilled" so to speak, still in the flow of popular culture and unable to fully detach himself from what he's always known.
It's so hard to convince people to trust the scientific method and actually investigate these matters with an open mind, instead of residing within a "feel-good" shell of "official" beliefs.

                Not sure what your point is.  What did you tell your father you were researching? That jews and crypto jews run the world?  That would be at odds with what you said earlier about jews not being the cause of the world's problems.  Would there be problems otherwise?  Of course, life is struggle and pain.  Would it be nearly as bad as it is with the jew presence?  Nope.  Jews are cancer to a healthy society.

                 There wasn't really a "point". I was just relating to you my experience.

                 Yes, it is at odds with what I said earlier. Not entirely though. I have been researching this topic heavily and I am realizing that a lot of the people in comments who are always talking about Jews and Zionism don't seem to be willing to explain what they mean and how these "Jews" aren't really Jews, but "re-purposed" Pagans. (I got that from this video:
                 <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SyZxHdlerPo&amp;">
                  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SyZxHdlerPo&amp;)
                 </a>
                 )
                </p>
                <p>
                 I believe Jesus Christ was a faithful Jew, and that Judaism at times throughout history was a good thing. But a lot of the time it has not been so good, it would seem.
                </p>
                <p>
                 Pagans and Satanists and Atheists are a cancer to human civilization and have claimed more lives than any other group, whether they claim to be Jews or no. After telling my father I was skeptical of the Holocaust he was not very happy. That is what specifically triggered him.

                  Modern day jews and crypto jews is what everyone here is talking about when they say "jews".  There are no Hebrew jews left on the planet.  The Ashkenazis fake jews are the mob that controls the world.  Rothchild, Warburg, Rockefeller, and a lot of waspy sounding names that are really crypto jews.

             The Hunt for Viganò: Vatican Spies Tracking Whistleblower:

           <p>
            Archbishop Vigano was smart enough to go into hiding before his letter was published, but Father Ramsey is still working as pastor of St. Joseph's Church Yorkville in New York City.  The pope will without doubt see his confirmation of Vigano's accusations as a crime.  The pastor had best watch his back.

            I have a feeling if those seminarians don't file lawsuits against McCarrick for sexual abuse, it will be on record that he only had one case against him.  To that child of course, it was a horrid experience that will haunt him for life.  But the Church can say, as they usually do, he has changed his ways and turned his life around.  He after all is living a life of nothing but prayers and penance.  Imo, he should be in jail.  I have a feeling there other altar boys from the past. We and those that have interest in reading these articles will be the only ones that will know.  Others, the sheep, sadly are not interested unless it is on Netflix or CNN.  Let's hope they band together and every sordid detail comes out.  McCarrick was known to take as many as 5 seminarians into his bed at one time.  I am sure there was fear to not comply or they would feel his wrath and retribution.  Monsignor Thomas J. Benestad is known to have a vile personality and a man of arrogance. I presume McCarrick is not much different. That is the way of all Narcissists.

              I don't know how they get away with it.  Everyone else has to go to jail for these crimes.  What's the deal that they have made and why does it continue.  Laws must be followed or laws must be passed to say that the Church can no longer allow them to go free.  They must follow our laws whether from  this country or not.    Also no more Diplomatic Immunity! No ifs and or buts!

               Yes, I suspect we are going to find out that this is why the "Catholic vote" has been largely liberal, despite so many liberal policies becoming diametrically opposed to Catholic teaching. After Vatican II, a large portion of those teachings stopped being taught in Catholic schools and Sunday homilies, replaced with "social justice" and "the preferential option of the poor".

                I too believe so many things changed after Vatican II.  Less mention of the devil and his existence has also changed the perception of many.  The devil is real.
