            Schools receive more funding if children are on psychotropic meds because they are labeled as special needs.  It's becoming a known practice where teachers are recommending children be put on meds and this isn't the first case where a child was removed from their parents and placed in foster care for this reason.  The state also benefits if a child is in the system and is labeled special needs because the federal funding is more lucrative for any child with that label, so not only will the school benefit financially but so does the state.  For a quick peak to see what they are doing to children in foster care take a look at this video with Diane Sawyer.

            They would have been well served to take their child to a private psychologist for a contradicting diagnosis so as to have something with which to challenge the school board's claims. That aside, this is disgusting! The top comment on this thread by carmencita asserts that schools receive kickbacks for having their students prescribed pharmaceuticals; can anyone corroborate that?

             As a child advocate for the past three years I can attest to the fact that schools do receive more funding for children who are on psychotropic meds.  I've seen it done time and time again.  It's extremely predominant in the foster care system where it's not only the schools who receive more funding but so does the state.  Watch this video with Diane Sawyer who exposed this issue.

              Is there a way that you can find out which school systems have more special needs kids? I know on Zillow it says the percentages of kids on free lunches at different schools. Is there something like that?

            As long as they have a "marriage license" , ample case law is clear that the state is a third party to all marriage contracts.
The birth certificate basically titles the child over to the state, thus allowing the state to act under the doctrine of Parens Patriae.
           </p>
           <p>
            The fact that they are receiving a "benefit" of free public school, the state gets even more jurisdiction, and this situation defaults to the common law maxim Cujus est commodum ejus debet esse incommodum. 
"He who receives the benefit should also bear the disadvantage."
           </p>
           <p>
            Not saying what the state is doing is right, but there are invisible contracts with the state at play here.

            Why would they order us to do this?  To take your child away from you.  Also, I read a few years ago, that a school gets paid for every child they get to take medication, so there is a kick back.

             This is kind of unrelated, but you remember the "Meth: not even once" ads? Meanwhile, they give ritalin to kids left and right, which is essentially meth.

              I have had two "friends of friends" who have taken Ritalin for ADHD as adults. One lost a ton of weight, started behaving as though she were on meth, and seemed to be addicted to it right away. The other one gained a lot of weight, calmed down in general, and didn't seem to have any kind of special feelings toward his medication. I assume the second one actually had ADHD or whatever.

              Parents as a group can fight this.  No parent should have to feel that alone that they have to put up with this.  It is beyond disgusting.  There are Aldermen and their is legal aid. Also you can go to your Representative but as a group.  Now is the time for people to start getting active about this in a big way. Now, not when it happens. It does not just happen to other people, it can happen to anyone. Yes they give it freely, and then later the kids get hooked so much easier on other drugs.  They are ruining a whole generation.  People are staring at their phones and binge watching Netflix.  It must stop before it is too late.  They will wake up one morning, and wonder how it all happened.

             Well shit that makes sense. My school did something like this to me. I was bored as fuck in school all the time and had major problems with authority and the zero tolerance bullshit. I pushed the limits of administration's nerves on the daily. In 5th grade they took me out of class put me in a dark cold and uncomfortable room gave me a weeks worth of testing. I asked the strange guy giving me the tests if this was graded or WTF it was for. I was told it was not graded but I should do my best. Knowing it was not a grade I purposely failed that shit hard 2+2=3.14159 sorta smart al·eck answers. A few days later the school told my mom I had ADHD and they put me on SSRIs I remember hating taking that drug. It made me think about killing myself, I mean really think about it long a hard never before had I had that problem. I tried to not take it but mom was instructed on how to make sure I was taking it. Now 20 years later they are telling me that the SSRI I took when I was a kid permanently altered my brain to be more negative. That's not the only shit they fucked up. The school then branded me as a special needs student and took me out of normal classes that I was doing just fine in and put me in a class of retards. I was stuck in that room for years before anyone let me prove I did not belong there. When I did finally get out I found myself way behind everyone else and fell behind because they just did not teach me jack shit for three years. The scary part was that there where kids in that room just as capable as I was (a substantial amount of the school population when you factor in how small the school was) but they where just ridding it out because it was "easy work." Fuck no child left behind and fuck schools for thinking they know what's best.

              The system 'handled' you.  It saw you as a threat and acted to suppress the threat.  I'm sorry this had to happen, and you had to be exposed to SSRIs.  My only advice is to not allow the mind to tell you that you cannot do something.  Push past it.

              We had great schools when I was growing up.  My now grown up son went to public school and he had great teachers.  They are infiltrating the schools with they type of people they know will push their disgusting plan.  I am so sorry for what happened to you.  I now remember reading your description of the drug.  It was in the same article.  The children in the article where all worse off with the drug than without it, but the parents were forced to make their children take it.  Take your anger and do something good with it. Remember that all the people on here are aware what they are doing. Remember what they did to you, but use it to do the best you can to make up the learning you did not receive.  Your anger will ruin your life and poison your soul.  They will have succeeded.  I will pray for you tonight.
