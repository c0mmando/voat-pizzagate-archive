<p>Today the newspapers are reporting a huge fire at a business warehouse centre in Basildon, Essex.  Reading the reports, one will be struck by the lack of detail.  So..  Let\'s start with the Daily Mail: <a href="http://archive.is/QNlJe#selection-805.0-805.109">More than 100 firefighters battle huge blaze that has ripped through a packaging warehouse in Essex overnight</a>  Apparently the first emergency call was made at <strong>12:21</strong>  (<em>That would be 33 in numerology...just sayin\'</em>)</p>
<p>Note that they say that the fire was started in a warehouse used for packaging and distribution.  No mention of which company.</p>
<p>So with Google maps: here\'s a list of the companies at the location- Festival Business Park, Basildon: <a href="http://imgur.com/a/LCPnz">http://imgur.com/a/LCPnz</a>  (I only looked at the first three)</p>
<p>First company is Storguard  <a href="http://www.storguard.co.uk/">http://www.storguard.co.uk/</a> They \'Store and archive your documents in-house can take up valuable space that could be used to help grow and develop your business\'. </p>
<p>Then, here\'s another view of the entrance to the park : <a href="http://imgur.com/a/rKzU7">http://imgur.com/a/rKzU7</a></p>
<p>See the logo on the right hand building?  Well, that\'s <strong>Gravity Force Basildon Ltd.</strong>   The second company at the park.  A family trampoline centre <a href="http://www.gravityforce.co.uk/">http://www.gravityforce.co.uk/</a></p>
<p>Apparently it went into liquidation in 2016: <a href="https://www.thegazette.co.uk/notice/2616945">https://www.thegazette.co.uk/notice/2616945</a> &gt;  A company check reveals two officers as Sarah and Lee Sims <a href="https://beta.companieshouse.gov.uk/company/09482625/officers">https://beta.companieshouse.gov.uk/company/09482625/officers</a></p>
<p>A google of Sarah Sims comes up with this utterly weird story  : <strong><a href="http://archive.is/1kGaH">Bogus doctor who claimed she had \'more psychiatric qualifications than Sigmund Freud\' and used her husband and parents as references is unmasked as serial liar</a></strong> </p>
<p><strong>excerpts</strong>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A bogus doctor who had \'more psychiatric qualifications than Sigmund Freud\' and used her husband and parents as fake references has been unmasked as a serial liar.</p>
<p>Sarah Sims claimed she had a long list of qualifications from the University of London and said she had been given a \'ladyship\' by Warwick University.</p>
<p><strong>The three-times married \'doctor\' also claimed she had been an officer in the Ministry of Defence as she applied to be head of childcare services at a children\'s home in Folkestone, Kent.</strong></p>
<p>But she was finally exposed as a fraud after the employers discovered her qualifications were completely made up.</p>
<p>Sims, 41, claimed on her CV that she received a first class bachelor\'s degree, master\'s degree and philosophy doctorate from the University of London.</p>
<p><strong>She said her last job had been lead welfare officer at the MoD, and included glowing testimonial from her line manager Sergeant Major Darren Pugh.</strong></p>
<p>Three-times married Sims, who lives in a <strong>Â£1million home near Canterbury</strong>, also claimed to be a member of the \'British Association of Counselling and Psychology (BCAP).\' </p>
<p>She added that she had been awarded the title of \'Ladyship\' from Warwick University for community \'good works\'.</p>
<p><strong>The highly-qualified \'doctor\' seemed the perfect fit for the role as operations director at Ferndearle Child Care Services</strong> - until it was revealed that nearly her entire CV was a lie.</p>
<p>A jury at Canterbury Crown Court heard that Sims did not receive any of the psychology degrees she claimed to own, and her university had no record of her ever being a student there.</p>
<p>Warwick University said it never gives out the title of \'ladyship\' and the British Association of Counselling and Psychology does not exist.</p>
<p>Sims\' glowing reference from her \'line manager\' <strong>Sergeant Major Darren Pugh turned out be be her 48-year-old husband</strong> - Darren Pugh - who was himself cleared of fraud. </p>
<p>\'In her CV, she also claimed to have worked as a lead consultant director for <strong>a company called EIS</strong>. There are no records of her ever working for EIS.\'</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="http://archive.is/EuQfY">In a local Kent newspaper the same case is reported</a>, this time with her address: The Manor, Lower Weddington Farm Road, Ash</p>
<p>Well, here\'s company information for Sergeant Major Darren Pugh <a href="https://companycheck.co.uk/director/917138561/MR-DARREN-PUGH/companies">https://companycheck.co.uk/director/917138561/MR-DARREN-PUGH/companies</a> .  (Same address)</p>
<p>He\'s got a company called Tag Security Limited.</p>
<p>His Linkedin profile states: </p>
<p>between 2011 and 2012, as a warrant officer: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>I am currently working as platoon commander cambrai training team, teaching hostile environment train to a wide spectrum of people from senior officers to civilian media, <strong>we also carry out bespoke courses for VIPs and MI5/6</strong> getting them ready to go on operations in to hostile environments</p>
</blockquote>
<p>with his MD Tag Security company, he writes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We as a company we offer Close Protection and CP Drivers all over the world, also provide Security Consultants on personal and property security. We provide personnel and equipment to keep our customers safe and secure. We now offer a assets retrieval service anywhere in the world especially in hostile environments. All my personnel are ex British military with over 5 years military service with at least one operational tour in a hostile environment, we supply top end ex military personnel. We bring tomorrows security to today\'s world</p>

<p>Here\'s a news article which mentions him in a case with a soldier on trial for abuse of Iraqi prisoners

            This is Jem777...been banned for refusing to back down on Tavistock. Is this the location the Hampstead Whistleblower children were taken?
           </p>
           <p>
            Believe the original Tavistock Center is where Sigmend Freud status still stands. They are trying to burn evidence.

             No.  The Tavistock Clinic is in Hampstead, another area of London.  Sorry to hear you were banned.

            Seems the Sarah Sims of Gravity Force Basildon and the Sarah Sims of the Ferndeale Child Care Services fraud case where her husband who works with MI5/6 was cleared of fraud are NOT the same person. HOWEVER, they do have something in common..seemingly, connections with MI5. (was that the point of the weird fraud story in the newspapers?)...New Post to follow..

              Tavistock Square was named after Lord Tavistock in the 17th century by then Duke of Bedford.  The Tavistock Centre that is familiar to PG research was indeed originally located there but has since moved to Hampstead ( the clinic, that is - the Tavistock Institute is now in Islington).  The only link is the name, in that the centre was originally named according to its original location.  That this company has a registered address in that same area is coincidental.

                  I haven't read this but now I understand what you mean about Tavistock Square history and I was obviously way off the mark I. Terms of what you meant.  Thanks for this.  I have to research this again as I knew some but not all.

            - upvoat for you.  Very strange that no company details of the fire location can be found in that article.  And this is only what was revealed from investigating only one of the companies listed at that park.  Wonder what else is hidden (or has been destroyed) there.
