<p>It is extremely important to draw the connection between the UK PEDOGATE and what is happening RIGHT NOW with PIZZAGATE.</p>
<p>We are on the same IDENTICAL path:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>New investigations have revealed pedophile rings operating out of multiple UK children’s care homes with half-hearted investigations and thwarted prosecutions spanning the last 30 years. The UK has been plagued with child care home abuse scandals with multiple coverup accusations made against Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, lost evidence, even <strong>suspicions that peodphile ring whistleblowers had been murdered</strong></p>
<p>The remarkable similarities between Jimmy Savile and John Podesta’s political capital cannot be ignored. Accusations against Jimmy Savile began in at least 1970, but were dismissed as ludicrous-exactly the reaction to the idea that John Podesta could be similarly inclined. And yet, 30 years later, the <strong>NHS releases this stunning report detailing Savile’s easy ability to abuse without impunity-precisely due to his connections and protection of being a political “insider”</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>FOR ALL THOSE WONDERING WHY I POST QUORA AND MEDIUM:</p>
<p>Can we all agree that mainstream media treats all pizzagate related material as if it is coming from inside an insane asylum?
That\'s how they are succeeding.</p>
<p>Spreading around SOBER, NON-SENSATIONAL, pieces which are BEYOND the notion of &quot;is this real or fake&quot; is important for people who only know the &quot;crazy pizzagate&quot; stuff.</p>
<p>If you think this writer got it wrong, put your money where your mouth is and WRITE ABOUT IT. Spread it around.</p>
<p>We all know that that they are scrubbing the web of this material yes? </p>
<p>Ok, so any place outside of Voat where we can find any serious mention of pizzagate is important.
My humble opinion.</p>
<p>Everytime I post this stuff on VOAT a new person reads it and another lead is found because other people have their info to add to the mix.
This is a good thing.</p>',
