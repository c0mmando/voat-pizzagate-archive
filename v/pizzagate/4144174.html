            , please have a look at our submission rules in the sidebar. You need to fully explain the elements of your pizzagate thesis, here (Rule 1), as well as hot-link to the YouTube vids and reddit thread and spell out the timestamps for each of the elements you're concerned about in the videos (Rule 2).
           </p>
           <p>
            Rule 3: It's not clear what your title about Kevin Spacey has to do with the Olsen twins.
           </p>
           <p>
            More Rule 2: Posts here to the main board need to have source links supporting all their major claims -- and your symbolism post in pgwhatever -- while fine for that sub -- isn't a strong enough submission to use as evidence in this post. We need support for symbols being what you say they are. Simply referencing Kabbalah doesn't work because you haven't defined what it means or supported that with links.
           </p>
           <p>
            I will give you our 24 Hour Grace flair, to give you the opportunity to edit this submission to bring it in line with our research requirements, but as it stands, this probably will just need to be reposted in

             What specifically do you reject about my symbols guide. Pretty simple to understand pizza is a triangle. Esoteric triangles in kabbalah, I can triple the size of this post if you want me to laying it out step by step how a pizza slice is a triangle. And there are extensive masonic references to triangles, like you know, their literal logo with a square and compass making the star of david with two triangles.

                You've got no link between Clinton and the Olsen twins.

                What's the context of this video? When was it made? Who produced it? Where does it fall in the career of these girls? Are her parents Democrats? Are they pandering to the establishment to get their kids' careers off the ground?

                The fact two kids made a video referencing a popular president at the time by itself does not lead to them having been trafficked to that president on Epstein's island. Even when everyone involved are starring members of the pizzagate shitshow. You have to lay out your case and support it with evidence at each step.

                This is shit-tier "research" that is nothing but confirmation bias. We don't allow this because it does nothing but undermine our thesis and make us look ridiculous.
