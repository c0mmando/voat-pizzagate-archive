              You think they might want to express outrage that a sitting Senator would have charges if sexual crimes and corruption involving minors or as most normal people call them children. But the the NYT would have to be ready to say that about almost entire US gov. You know Melendez is singing.

               As a former lifelong reader of the NYTimes and the WAPO, the current level of propaganda and intentional disinformation is surreal, and I honestly never thought I would see such a thing, ever.

            A touch of history...
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             1993 Robert ["Bob"] Menendez had recently been sworn in as New Jersey's first Hispanic congressman and was running for re-election when he met eye doctor Salomon Melgen at a Florida Fundraiser
            </p>
           </blockquote>
           <p>
            Now, their relationship is the subject of a federal corruption case. Menendez and Melgen, both 61, were indicted on conspiracy, bribery, and fraud charges. Prosecutors allege that Menendez used his political influence to help Melgen's business dealings after accepting lavish gifts and large campaign donations from the doctor.
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             One business dealing Menendez assisted Melgen with involved port security for the Dominican Republic.
            </p>
           </blockquote>
           <p>
            They spent a lot of time in Casa de Campo...
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             The friendship between the two men goes back to the 1990s, when Mr. Menendez, who entered the House of Representatives in 1993, began regularly visiting the Dominican Republic. They spent holidays together, often in the Dominican Republic, where Dr. Melgen has a home in Casa de Campo, a gated oceanfront resort where houses cost as much as $20 million and which has been home to some of the country’s richest residents, like Oscar de la Renta. Both enjoyed a good cigar and playing golf; Casa de Campo has several places to play, designed by the renowned course architect Pete Dye.
            </p>
            <p>
             1998 – Dr. Salomon Melgen makes a seed venture investment in Seisint, a Boca Raton Florida database company founded by admitted Caribbean cocaine smuggler Hank Asher, who claims to have voluntarily left the business to “go straight” and become a legitimate entrepreneur. Melgen’s lawyer will later claim that the profits off this investment formed the basis of his substantial wealth.
            </p>
           </blockquote>
           <p>
            Did we mention the thing about Casa de Campo?
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             Casa de Campo is the wealthiest resort on the island, and it resembles in many ways an entire country unto itself. The resort has its own airport, beaches, and golf course. Security guards, or "guachimanes,"
            </p>
            <blockquote>
             <p>
              Drugs, money laundering and corruption is what makes the wheels turn around in the Dominican Republic. And if you like to see many of the criminals and corrupt officials blowing cash, just visit their weekend play ground Casa de Campo in La Romana. Drug dealers like to hide in Casa de Campo because the police are not [patrolling] there, for some odd reason Casa de Campo has their private security company for the 2000 resident area, but several villas has been seized in Casa de Campo in connection to drug cases in the last two years.

           <p>
            Anyway...
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             2010, Dr. Melgen moved to buy the ownership interest in ICSSI, a company based in the Caribbean that had been awarded a contract to provide extensive screening of cargo from ports in the Dominican Republic. The Dominican government was refusing to honor that contract, after Miguel Cocco, then the Dominican customs director, had long said the deal was an exorbitant giveaway to the company.
            </p>
            <p>
             2011 Two years ago [in 2011], Dr. Melgen, despite an apparent lack of experience in border security issues, bought an ownership interest in a company that had a long-dormant contract with the Dominican Republic to provide port security. Mr. Menendez, who is chairman of the Senate subcommittee that holds sway over the Dominican Republic, subsequently urged officials in the State and Commerce Departments to intervene so the contract would be enforced, at an estimated value of $500 million.
            </p>
            <p>
             2011 Dr. Melgen founded a Latino-oriented news Web site, Voxxi, which has also emphasized the need for the port security deal and glowingly depicted Mr. Menendez as a giant among Latinos.
            </p>
            <p>
             2013 team of agents from the Federal Bureau of Investigation raided Dr. Melgen’s offices in West Palm Beach, removing 30 boxes of documents and other material, and the senator now finds himself defending his relationship with a major political benefactor just as he is on the verge of reaching the most prestigious post of his career — the chairmanship of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.

            <p>
             Dr. Salomon Melgen has other politician pals too, such as Gov. Terry Macauliffe (hard to forget him, the two helicopter pilots who died in Charlottesville had just left the scene to go escort the Governor right before dying in a fiery freak helicopter crash). People on the ground might have seen the smoke, or not...

            <p>
             “There was no police presence,” one woman told the Times. “We were watching people punch each other; people were bleeding all the while police were inside of barricades at the park, watching. It was essentially just brawling on the street and community members trying to protect each other.”

             And just think right after Gov. Macaulliffe and Sen. Melendez are placed under FBI investigation the Deputy Director of the FBI Andrew McCabe (who is in charge of their pal HRC email investigation) goes to a little secret meeting with Gov. Macaulliffe and accepts $700,000.
            </p>
            <p>
             Never discloses it....when Senator Grassley learns and writes a letter to James Comey he stated there was no ethical issue...we are all shocked right!!
            </p>
            <p>
             McCabe buys a new Porshe911 and continues to lead the HRC investigation into nowhere on purpose.

               <blockquote>
                <p>
                 Mueller was nominated for the position of FBI director by George W. Bush on July 5, 2001.
                </p>
                <p>
                 Confirmation hearings for Mueller before the Senate Judiciary Committee were quickly set for July 30, only three days before his prostate cancer surgery. The vote on the Senate floor on August 2, 2001, passed unanimously, 98–0.
                </p>
                <p>
                 He served as acting deputy attorney- general of the United States Department of Justice for several months before officially becoming the FBI director on September 4, 2001, just one week before the September 11 attacks against the United States.
                </p>
                <p>
                 Mueller, along with deputy attorney general James Comey, threatened to resign from office, in March 2004, if the White House overruled a Department of Justice finding that domestic wiretapping without a court warrant was unconstitutional.
                </p>
                <p>
                 Attorney General John Ashcroft denied his consent to attempts by White House Chief of Staff Andrew Card and White House Counsel Alberto Gonzales to waive the Justice Department ruling and permit the domestic warrantless eavesdropping program to proceed. On March 12, 2004, George W. Bush gave his support to changes in the program sufficient to satisfy the concerns of Mueller, Ashcroft and Comey.
                </p>
                <p>
                 In May 2011, Barack Obama asked Mueller to continue at the helm of the FBI for two additional years beyond his normal 10-year term, which would have expired on September 4, 2011.  The Senate approved this request on July 27, 2011.  On September 4, 2013, Mueller was replaced by James Comey.

                Robert Mueller et. al....
               </p>
               <blockquote>
                <p>
                 David Asimov, of Living Oak Court, Bennett Ridge, Santa Rosa, the son of the late science fiction writer Isaac Asimov, was sentenced on March 28, 2001 to six months' home detention with electronic monitoring and three years federal probation for possessing child pornography. U.S. District Court Judge Maxine M. Chesney sentenced Asimov after reviewing a series of sealed psychiatric reports, one of which was ordered by the court. Asimov who was charged with four federal counts of possession of child pornography with each count carrying a five year sentence, pled guilty to two counts in a plea bargain deal. There was no forfeiture of any of Asimov's assets in this case, despite his owning a home in Santa Rosa purchased in 1996 for $375,000, and despite his receiving $3,000 per month from his father's estate.
                </p>
                <p>
                 How did Asimov, who possessed one of the largest stashes of pornography in California, skate away from federal prison? A look at the players yields the answer.
                </p>
                <p>
                 Asimov's child porn stash was so big many child victims and perpetrators would have taken a fall, had Asimov been zealously prosecuted at trial.
                </p>
                <p>
                 The Sonoma County District Attorney J. Michael Mullins covered up the case, let the public believe the feds would prosecute it more thoroughly, and then passed the cover up to U.S. Attorney Mueller.
                </p>
                <p>
                 U.S. Attorney Mueller delivered a sweet plea bargain to Asimov.
                </p>
                <p>
                 Asimov was indicted by a federal grand jury in November 1999 on four counts of possessing images of child pornography. Because the grand jury transcript has not been released to the public, the public cannot determine whether evidence of distribution and sale of pornography was ever presented by the U.S. Attorney.
                </p>
                <p>
                 In December 1999, Asimov pled not guilty in federal court, and was released on his own recognizance.
                </p>
                <p>
                 In the summer of 1999, U.S. Attorney Mueller engaged in plea deal with Asimov, by dropping two counts. At this point, Asimov and his attorney were close to obtaining a sentence which would not involve state prison or forfeiture of assets.
                </p>
                <p>
                 Robert Mueller: Who made sure David Asimov got off scott-free, without even posting so much as bail, or any property forfeiture, and miraculously never spent a single day in jail for his horrible crimes!

             Sen. Robert Menendez may have hired underage hookers: feds - NY Daily News

            "Prosecutors used the defense claims to highlight previously undisclosed tidbits on Menendez's pursuit of younger woman."
           </p>

            '"Many of these young women receive substantial financial support from defendant Melgen," prosecutors say. '

            'Robert Menendez cavorted with underage hookers – widely seen as discredited – are false. '

           <p>
            'Those are flights "Menendez did not pay for or report, and continued to conceal after the allegations surfaced," prosecutors said. '

            'They called only those who were involved in the corrupt exchange where Menendez used his power to help "Melgen bring his foreign girlfriends into the United States," while Melgen used his wealth to help "Menendez take his American girlfriends on exotic overseas vacations."'
