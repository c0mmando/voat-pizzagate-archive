            Hell no. That's ridiculous. You've got two external factors yanking your chain.
           </p>
           <p>
            One, no arrests yet, so you're getting worn out, understandably, two, you've been listening to Alex Jones and Mike Cernovich espousing this kind of nonsense.
           </p>
           <p>
            They want us to look away because of the important players involved (Podesta's, Brock, Clinton's, etc.), and where a proper investigation might lead and/or uncover.

            I think this is all crazy.  How would Dahmer's murders be staged?  Is this false flag nonsense?  What would be the purpose of this fear?
           </p>
           <p>
            Also that sculpture has nothing to do with Jeffrey Dahmer, it's inspired by a 19th Century french doctor who studied hysteria, he said patients often were so tense they took that pose.  This doctor, Charcot, was one of Freud's teachers.  Search Charcot and hysteria and you will find many illustrations of arched figures from the 1800's.
           </p>
           <p>
            And to prove the art has nothing to do with Dahmer, her is one of the early sketches for the first work in that series.
            <a href="https://www.moma.org/collection_lb/browse_results.php?object_id=70922">
             https://www.moma.org/collection_lb/browse_results.php?object_id=70922
            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            This is what the artist says about the work
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             "This is a feminist statement. It is a document which proves the prejudice of Charcot." (Jean-Martin Charcot [1825-1893], considered the father of modern neurology, was also the teacher of Sigmund Freud.) "For Charcot," Bourgeois said, "the arched body... the hysterical woman... was a subject of entertainment... she was made to be ridiculous and laughable. And hysterical people were always thought to be women. But that is a superstition! This document shows that men were also hysterical. I am trying to prove a point here. Charcot made fun of women... like my father made fun of me."
            </p>
