<p>Now to my revelations!</p>
<p>The word ”fun run” is not used in that email however it’s used in others. Like this:</p>
<p>Hi John,
You are receiving this email because the waiver for NCB Capitol Hill
Classic 10K, 3K, and Fun Run is not yet signed and the associated
registration is incomplete. If you signed up someone else such as a team
member* or child, or were signed up by someone else, we’re missing a signed
event waiver!</p>
<p><a href="https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/17128">https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/17128</a></p>
<p>Notice the line: ”team member* or child”. The eventmanager ends the letter with the words ”Have fun”.</p>
<p>When the Jimmy Savile scandal broke I read alot about it. I remember that I noticed that he used the word ”fun” quite often in interviews in a way that – at least in retrospect – seemed to hint of his abusive behaviour as well as being a way for him to explain it away and minimize it.</p>
<p>”“All my life I was governed by fun; every day’s Christmas Day, every night’s New Year’s Eve. It’s all fun, and there’s nothing wrong with a bit of fun.” Those were the last, autobiographical words of a documentary, “Sir Jimmy Savile — As It Happened,” spoken by the film’s subject, a British D.J. who hosted popular music and children’s programs for the BBC in the 1960s and ’70s.””</p>
<p><a href="http://thelede.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/10/26/who-was-jimmy-savile/?_r=0">http://thelede.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/10/26/who-was-jimmy-savile/?_r=0</a></p>
<p>Some days ago I checked out his imdb page and noticed that the second imdb entry for Jimmy Savile was a musical comedy from 1963 with the title ”Just for fun” with an – for the case - interesting plot involving politicians, djs and teenagers – and the forming of a third political party – perhaps the original ”pizza party”?</p>
<p>This is the description of the plot on imdb:
”With an election approaching, the two major political parties in England work desperately to capture the enthusiasm of teenagers, who have been granted the right to vote. When the prime minister cuts the quota of musical programs permitted on television, teenagers Mark and Cherry lead others youngsters in forming their own political party, which successfully utilizes popular recording artists in helping to win the election”.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0057213/">http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0057213/</a></p>
<p>Now to the subject of so called ”fun runs”. Jimmy Savile not only participated in loads of fun runs all across the british isles. He also founded runs and used these events for committing abuse:</p>
<p>”In 1981 a teenaged athlete who did a fun run for charity and had photos taken with Savile said he sexually assaulted her and a friend. The report found there was &quot;no reason to doubt&quot; this”.</p>
<p><a href="http://news.sky.com/story/jimmy-savile-what-the-official-reports-say-10369948">http://news.sky.com/story/jimmy-savile-what-the-official-reports-say-10369948</a></p>
<p>According to a note he himself signed he took part in a fun run at Haut de la Garenne on the island of Jersey. Now, there have been widespread accusations and inquiries regarding child abuse involving the elite at the child care home at this location. From the BBC:
 ”The police said there was insufficient evidence for the investigation into Savile, which was part of a three-year inquiry into abuse at Haut de la Garenne, to proceed.</p>
<p>”The note, dated 19 April 1976 and signed by Savile, describes him doing a fun run with a teenage girl from Haut de la Garenne and the money raised”.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-jersey-30388456">http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-jersey-30388456</a></p>
<p>He also founded at least one ”fun run”:</p>

<p>One last note. I think that while it’s important to notice and point out the use of words, symbols and signs by sinister groups, it’s also important not to let evil people claim too many words, symbols and signs – at least not the more general one’s like pizza for instance or perhaps a pyramid or a v-sign for victory. That in itself one could call a kind of mind control – making the good people mute and without ways to express themselves. I hope I haven’t destroyed the word ”fun” for you with this post.</p>
