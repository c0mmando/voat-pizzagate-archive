            Kenneth V Lanning, wrote this  "Investigators Guide to alligations of "Ritual" Child Abuse" in Jan 1992. For the FBI and was a FBI Supervisory Special Agent. He is now retired and consults, and works with the Missing and Exploited Children Network. Has been given awards for this piece of shit and for his work telling the courts that victims are crazy. How is he still allowed to work in this field? Why doesn't anyone question his ethics. Every investigator regardless if FBI or county sheriff,  are  incouraged to study this paper before persuing any satan ritual accusations. unbelievable. Google this guy and see for your self. I am really hoping I read it wrong. My stomach hurts. how has he been able to influence the cases of SRA children for so many years and no one look into him. I am horrified.

            Please read this exerpt from his final conclusion:  "Until hard evidence is obtained and corroborated, the public should not be frightened into believing

           <p>

           </p>
           <p>
            with absolute certainty that such activity has NOT occurred. The burden of proof, however, as it would

            be in a criminal prosecution, is on those who claim that it has occurred. The explanation that the satanists
           </p>
           <p>
            are too organized and law enforcement is too incompetent only goes so far in explaining the lack of

           </p>
           <p>
            allegations of victims of ritual abuse. There is little or no evidence for the portion of their allegations that

           <p>
            to mental health professionals, not law enforcement, to explain why victims are alleging things that don't

           <p>
            seem to have happened. Professionals in this field must accept the fact that there is still much we do not
           </p>
           <p>
            know about the sexual victimization of children and that this area desperately needs study and research

            <p>
             Wilfred Wong is an international human rights activist, campaigner and fundraiser for persecuted Christians and also on children’s issues. His life is currently divided between these two strands, but how did this begin and where has God led him along these paths?
            </p>
            <p>
             Wilfred was born and brought up in Singapore. He did not have a Christian upbringing but was sent to a Christian school where, aged 8, he gave his life to the Lord. He came to the UK in 1986 to study law and qualified as a barrister, practising for a short time. Before long the Lord led him into two specialist areas - persecuted Christians and the welfare of children – and this became a full-time ministry. His background in law would prove helpful but there would be no time for him to continue working as a barrister.
            </p>
            <p>
             Early Campaign Work
            </p>
            <p>
             From 1989 Wilfred undertook voluntary work campaigning on behalf of Christian prisoners in the USSR, as well as on behalf of persecuted Christians in some Muslim-majority countries, including Egypt. But the big change came in 1993 when he felt called to leave his legal career and become a full-time activist. Although this was tough at first, God clearly led him, opening doors and overcoming obstacles.
            </p>
            <p>
             For the next 16 years, Wilfred was a Parliamentary lobbyist with an office in the House of Commons. In this role, obtained through the Jubilee Campaign, he was responsible for arranging meetings and helping MPs speak out on these important topics.
