            I have read accounts by some victims that say they have had a "frozen memory"  which means they freeze what happened and it does not come out until years later.  Sometimes not until 40 or 50 years.  Something triggers it and sometimes no one knows what.  Even they say it is too painful to process when it happens, if it does happen at all.  Sometimes I believe they carry it with them to the grave, for it is locked away.  Many have said that when they seek out psychiatric help, that it is much more painful than even they had imagined.  This is so very very sad.  So the hope, possibly is of the pedophile, that the victim can never deal with the pain and so the truth never is told. Disgusting.

            I know I've mention Dr Steven Greer a few times on here with no reply but I feel this is something that needs to be watched to understand the power struggle between the elite what the are doing it for.
           </p>
           <p>
            The video is 3 hours long but if you get the time I feel he may answer some of your questions.

             I watched the entire vid. He is on point with a lot. At one point he even references a pizza joint as a front with prostitution being brokered out the back door. So much confirmation with documents supporting this. He even mentions the CIA ex director that was found drowned in the potamac.  I found it interesting that he met with podesta and many high level operatives that are involved. It seems he thinks he accepts their claims of ignorance. There was a lot of very interesting documents and information confirming much about the deep state and the role that drug trafficking plays. I can't tell if he is disinformation. I think this needs it own post.

              Hallelujah! It's not just me that it connected Pizzagate dots for. AFTER Pizzagate happened he released another video and mentions Podesta several times saying that he made sure he gave this info to Podesta to hand over to Trump.

              Ok I will post when I get 10 mins today. Any ideas what to include in the headline?
             </p>
             <p>
              Edit .. The scariest part is he has been claiming these things since at least 1992!
             </p>
             <p>
              I did try and search his credibility a while back but the likely culprits that tell us PG is fake news say Dr Greer is talking crazy so I take that as he's one of us hehehe.

                No that's fine as long as we get the info out there for people to see. If I'm being honest it put me off posting the amount of people getting angered over the shills the last week or so and didn't want the old schoolers here to think I was doing the same. I don't doubt there are lots of shills here but I also think a lot of lurkers (like me) finally grew a pair and started contributing what we can it just seems to be getting a little messy with everyone's insight.

               <p>
                It feels like there needs to be a better set up of evidence but I couldn't even begin to contemplate how, where and which way we could lay it out. Like the little tiny details that seem like nothing but put together paint a much bigger picture.

                 I am mostly a lurker myself and thank you for posting. I had to recently take a break because the sub got so negative and also a lot of information was not eveidence based. At least to me. Lately Reddit seems to have more up to date information. I included a link about max spears because he was a UFO investigator who was investigating an army pedo ring. I think there is some really solid leads on that video. I have to commend you for connecting that to pizza gate. I can help you spread it. But I don't need any credit either. I tend to just lurk and I am not very techie at all! But I can upvoat and post comments! Always happy to help how I can!

                  Yes I know what you mean. We have to bring positivity where we can :) ignore the shills .. save the energy. Started watching Max Spiers and had to take a break on it. Yes please spread it! Im a technophobe ha. But always happy to help too.

                   Lol the future belongs to the children/techies! Yes I will spread but I was surprised not too many responded to the post at all. They seem more interested I likely Cyrus....I don't know, the video is a bit long. I will repost again maybe with more details. Maybe that will help. I still think it confirms and also provides a ton of leads.

                    Yes very surprised not many people upvoted, watched or commented. Maybe you are right. The 3 hours is a little off putting. I am planning on sitting down with pen and paper today making notes of relevant info and time stamps and re post video with info layed out as easy to read as possible. I believe there is a way to PM on here if you would like to compare notes before posting?

                    OP mention him being connected to Rockefellers .. could do with researching more into this too if people are going to "debunk" his work without watching the video.

                    Edit .. I'm posting UK time but wondering if it would be better if I post it late tonight to catch the American views and comments?

            One thing that irks me is when somebody comes along and says, "ooooh, there was a
            <em>
             Satanic Panic
            </em>
            before, but where were the victims?". It's not that there weren't any victims, it's that they couldn't come forward because they were either dead or simply too frightened to speak out. Even some who weren't murdered might have took their own lives eventually due to the trauma (although I'd still call that murder).

            I think their is too much surpressed information on vibrations and energy that we don't understand. Child sacrifice has been around at least as long as the Maya's and I believe I read somewhere also happened with the Egyptians too? Their is documented evidence that the vatican has millions of superseded information. So right now we don't understand what these people are doing it for.

            There seems to be a lot more to getting rid of the Jews in the war and experiments were done on different blood groups, the eye condition Maddie had (I have seen threads on here before claiming this is something Soros is reasearching now). Project Paperclip brought the crazy nazi scientists into the CIA and continued their work produced MK Ultra etc.

There are accounts of therapists like Alison Miller, Bettina Overcamp, Orit Epstein and other psychologists. Scince I am European i want to point out to the witnesses on the Dutroux case whose testimonies can be accessed at

            Besides, trauma most often is accompanied by extreme shame and fear. Massive traumatised persons reach the state of freezing which means that they are incapable of any move in words and deeds.

            No, just won't be drawn into context-splicing with an arsehole, whatever your petty motivation. As you are probably aware, the majority of people on here are aware of something (incredibly well evidenced) which was flagged up (rightly or wrongly) by a series of "unfortunate coincidences". The focus is on identifying the scale of the corruption and ensuring that an investigation is maintained via online monitoring (something which did not happen in cases in Belgium and the UK). Assuming CPP is clean (circumstantially dubious), it has raised key evidence of a major cover up, backed up by Law Enforcement action. As for being appalled by this, that would be a very human reaction, spending time mocking people for giving a shit about child abuse, however, is an incredibly puerile one. As for your motivation, I don't care. You're clearly a waste of oxygen and resources.

             ADVICE:: don't waste your energy rationalizing with 'shills'
            </p>
            <p>
             he gets paid money to post this stuff and hey, everyone has families to feed...
            </p>
            <p>
             but, the reason they pay for this aggressively obvious style is BECAUSE people will get angry and respond. The energy they respond with is thereby energy that can no longer be used for positive purposes.
            </p>
            <p>
             It's important to protect your own fuel reserves. People who GENUINELY want what's best for humanity and best for the future of our children can find ways of discussing anything here without the use of negative tactics. If you feel yourself having to use negativity within your response, it's most likely an extraction of energy.

              Pretty much coincided with my morning shit, more a natural movement than an energetic reaction...I find it useful, on occasion, to demonstrate reason, if only for the exercise. I'm far too thrawn to be angered on here.
Cheers.

            Prof Tjeerd Andringa (University of Groningen) on The Corbett Report, cognitive scientific model for "kakistocracy", provides an explanation of how elite pedophilia is a "logical" outcome of the mechanics of our ruling elites. I have a background in psychology, social care and child protection and have been aware of these issues since 96 (DuTroux/Dunblane cover ups), and Andringa provides valuable insight.

             Good video.  However as he's a cognitive scientist he brings that dimension of understanding to the issue.  Somehow I think there's more to it than this understanding of power dynamics.

              I totally agree, but where it's so useful is demonstrating the basic framework for sociopathic/psychopathic power channels, from here the "nature of the beast" in itself will create a cesspool of damaged psyches with varying degrees of sickness and motivation.

             It's incredibly tiresome. Also, to make the claim that "there are no victims" of institutional/elite child abuse is less scientifically credible than Creationism.

              Well I guess if you're getting paid to shill might as well shill. Seems like an easy job.  Do you think they have to print out their comments and replies? Do they boast to their peers about blue pilling normies?

            Some of the trauma intends to create a psychological barrier for the victim if they try to tell anyone about the abuse.  Did you ever see that episode of LOST where The Others convinced sawyer he was going to die of a TRIGGERED heart attack if his heart beat got to high?  Do a fake operation on a child and tell them you implanted a heart attack device that they would trigger if they ever tried running away and talking.
