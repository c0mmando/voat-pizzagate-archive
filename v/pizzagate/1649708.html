<h2>Using what is called “pluripotent stem cells”, embryonicembroyonic stem cells, they can ‘cause’ the regeneneuronof nephron progenitor cells, and ultimately functional kidney tissue. Colomboma, the eye thing, results in the over production of the protien PAX2 and when combined with p53 kidney transfer, growth or regrowth can be accomplished.

           are threads linking pizzagate suspects to this issue. Specifically retinal-coloboma. It is important to understand that these elitist money hoarders like to diversify their revenue streams and want to live as long as possible. Oxidative stresses are known to cause recessive genes to express themselves. Could 'they' be using pedophiles to cause the expression of genes in their carefully selected victims prior to them extracting blood or even killing their victims to harvest all their fluids and tissues? 'They' harvest fetal tissues for big $ from abortions,

           (stem cells that have limited divisions) and chemical signals contribute to the production of these cells.  Retinal Coloboma is known for the over production of PAX2 proteins and influence the patterns of tissue-specific development,
           <a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S000294401064597X?np=y&amp;npKey=44a8ba7100e0df7f140d55bcb0fd5fce939336683e01c07c94a0f26fb67cde7b">

           Furthermore, the development of kidneys and retinal cells are co-regulated by a protein, p53 , and PAX2 and acts as a chemical signal that promotes nephrogenesis (kidney development) , thus contributing to nephron endowment (amount of stem cell like cells),

            So I have a question I've read your entire article. Are you suggesting that (((They))) are doing "Genetic Testing" and "Blood Screening" of the 10's - 100's of thousands of children abducted / yr to look for certain genetic deficiencies? Is that what you are getting at? With the "2" people involved that have Colomboma? Your entire thesis of "Proof" circulates around the disappearance in 07' of Maddy, and Baby Caris right?

            <p>
             The method for inducing progenitor cells to make nephrons from human iPS cells was reported previously by Kumamoto University Professor Ryuichi Nishinakamura's research group in 2013, but a large number of precursor cells are required for regenerative medicine. Many researchers have tried to culture kidney progenitor cells, but these cells could only be kept for two to three days at most.

            ARMI will favor 'their' 'teams' with proposals for the 'open calls' - the $ and friends are absurd.  Regardless the intent is great, the source of their "raw materials" is in question.

            Maybe we need to create alternatives to put a stop to this and also, with the new generation, things are changing.  Despite the agenda of dumbing down as it were, I would say there has never been a more educated and brilliant youth.

             You're so right about the kids. The 8th graders today are so much more aware of what going on than I ever was at their age. I teach that grade right now, and politics are always an topic that comes up. I did not reach their level of interest in global affairs until way late high school. People whine and bitch about how dumb millennials are, but I have yet to see young kids more ready to ask the right questions and seek out the answers themselves. We are in good hands, as long as we fix the country for them. Ousting the shit show that was the Clinton-Bush elitist dynasty was a good first step I hope.

               Iris coloboma and madeleine mccann investigators should watch Force Majeure episode of Millenium tv series from 1997 (pizzagate)
submitted 1 month ago by basil999
I don't know enough details about the case to speculate but this episode seems to fit some of the details and it predates it. May 5 is mentioned in the episode as being important, Mccann was born May 12 dissapeared May 3, iris coloboma is involved, cloning of superior beings, both Madeleine's parents are physicians, lots of stuff that may be somehow related.
