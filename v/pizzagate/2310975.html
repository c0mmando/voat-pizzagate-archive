<p>Here is the email in question:  <a href="https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/1802">email for John Podesta c/o Eryn re Space Treaty (attached)</a>
It was sent a few months before Edgar Mitchell Died on February 4th 2016 <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/feature/apollo-astronaut-edgar-mitchell-dies-at-age-85/">as reported by NASA.</a></p>
<p>How does this relate to Pizzagate?  Well because on 9/11 the technology discussed within this email was used to turn the twin towers to dust, quite literally.

<h2>I find the above statement ever so slightly concerning on a biblical level.  How do you feel about it?</h2>
<p>People have mentioned the obsolete warfare methods in which depleted uranium might be utilised.</p>
<h2>I have heard far less with regards to the application of depleted uranium in the cold fusion process.</h2>
<p>Perhaps the reason we hear far less about it, is because it directly ties John Podesta to 9/11, in his involvement in several Uranium Based ventures - including Uranium One, Unlimited Joules and Leonido Holdings.</p>
<p>The rather interesting thing about Unlimited Joules, is that it is a company based out of MIT, which we know ties directly to <a href="https://www.wired.com/1998/12/podesta/">Tony Podesta</a>.</p>
<p>Also alleged hacker <a href="https://www.bostonglobe.com/metro/2014/03/29/the-inside-story-mit-and-aaron-swartz/YvJZ5P6VHaPJusReuaN7SI/story.html">Aaron Swartz.</a></p>
<hr />
<p>I do not doubt for one second the <em>Boeing withholding of emails spectacle</em> is also related to the disclosure that the 9/11 planes do not exist with the aviation bureau records, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdaxWZFSD74">as stated by Researcher Dr. Morgan Reynolds</a> - former Bush administration advisor.</p>
<p>I know everyone was freaking out for a period over the 2011 videos of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CGyJ-0hrR2s">Trump explicitly mentioning Pizzagate with regards to Anthony Weiner</a>. Did anyone ever consider the fact these are cartoon villains, projected upon 3d reality in order to manipulate the minds of man?</p>
<p>I am inclined to ask how politics really affects our lives aside from as a distraction and thief.  I mean just look at the current medical system and the fact politicians knowingly allow for the punishment of parents helping their children with medical cannabis.  That\'s not normal, decent or human by any stretch of the imagination.  It\'s monstrous and mankind has largely accepted it as a simple fact of life of which we are expected to rally against in protest.  Appealing to the unreasonable is stupid.  It\'s the real genocide, along with the crap-fake food many people are consuming which has nothing of nutritional and as a consequence of this, people are never satiated.  No wonder there is an obesity crisis!  No wonder!  It\'s disgusting what a consumeristic mess America has become.  This despite any suggestion to the contrary by liberals, is not the vision of Adam Smith.</p>
