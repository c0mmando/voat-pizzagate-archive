<h2>Thread by a goat on QRV with military helo experience on why this wasn\'t a training operation, as the Army claimed: <a href="https://voat.co/v/QRV/3022857">Helicopter Anon here with some thoughts</a></h2>
<p>Text of MilSpec Ops Monkey\'s first tweet thread, above:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Operators operarating operationally: I spent today looking into the mil op “training” and the building they breached. I will begin by saying I believe the Army is pushing disinformation with regard to “training”. What we discovered - the buildings are owned by a single owner 
Thomas V. Girardi.</p>
<p>Video is from the rooftop of an adjacent hotel. Buildings are owned by Thomas V Gilardi. Most recent leaser is a Eduardo G Sanchez - “Guatemalan House of Culture” Both are Attorneys. Building is likely vacant as there are plans in place to demo it. </p>
<p>Here is where it gets interesting. Both Attorneys have an extensive array of investments: Law Firms, Pharmaceuticals, Casinos, Labs and Cold Storage. What DOESNT come up are the acft charter or Guatemalan House of Culture on their list of investments. Girardi has 3 acft under G&amp;L Aviation - 2 cannot be tracked; but frequent central america associated with his law firm work. The 3rd, under an LLC is fairly active and tracable. Girardi’s wife Erika is a frequent flyer. </p>
<p>Girardi investments have been suspected of being connected to human trafficking, MK Uktra, organ harvesting, genetic modification, cloning, etc. He also has very close ties with the Clinton’s and Clare Bronfman. (See thread for supporting links). His wife Erika, is one of the Hollywood elite and also has several investments. You may know her from the Housewives of Beverly Hills. </p>
<p>Girardi seems to be having cash flow problems - maybe from assets being frozen? He also has indictments against him as well as an action to have him disbarred (See twitter thread for links).</p>
<p>The Leasor of the building in question also has his fair share of suspect investments. Note the Kool Aide Properties, LLC and the numerous hispanic connections. Possible cartel ties?  
</p>
<p>This rabbit hole goes very deep, and could end up being far greater than the Epstein, NXIVM discoveries. The likelihood that 40+ highly trained Operators just so happen to breach the very building owned by Girardi, with these connections, is about zero.&quot;</p>

            More info:
           </p>
           <p>
            I just showed the 2 videos of the assault in DTLA to a friend of mine who is a retired Navy helo pilot who cross-trained with 160th SOAR:
           </p>
           <p>
            1) Under ZERO circumstances would training like that ever be permitted;
           </p>
           <p>
            2) Confirmed that 2 crew on the ground were wearing "baked potatoes" (firefighting suits).
           </p>
           <p>
            3) We noted the hose was a fire hose, not a garden hose, likely hooked to the bib of a the building or a hydrant.
           </p>
           <p>
            4) ZERO reasons to spray down a bird like that.
           </p>
           <p>
            5) Absolutely special operations - no other operators of those types of helos.
           </p>
           <p>
            6) I sent him the links and he is going to socialize around his community for more info. It shouldn't take more than a day or so to get new intel.

            Did they scrap older reviews? Because the only two reviews they got were made after the raid, by people who read about it:

             This is the place that the Military drills took place in DTLA on February 5.... Its strange i can not find the owners name or board of directors. Military men can be seen carrying items from this building as they exited. And left in two black hawk helicopters. Next door is Tom Giardi and Keese Law Firm. Giradi is a known Hilliary Clinton donor and campaign manager. Also Giradi is envilved with Allison Max and the Nxivm Sex Cult. I am willing to bet Giardi owns this property infact i called Giardi and Keese and ask about it. Was told that building was empty and they had knowledge that this event was going to take place. Said it was TOP SECRET.

            And the photos the Twitter guy showed are not on the Yelp page. Maybe on the Guatemalan House of Culture website?

             No. You are looking at the wrong Yelp. The business name on Yelp was in Spanish: La Casa de la Cultural de Guatemala. I included screenshots of those.

            Here's another video of those choppers coming down the street in LA. If this was a "training" operation, why was a civilian on the sidewalk filming this? Wouldn't cops have cordoned off any training areas, in case one of the choppers went down?

            And have you noticed the lack of trolling in this submission? This could be the first submission I've ever made that hasn't been attacked.

             I don't share much, but I got the beat down on plebbit, so I proved it over there. I have been in plenty of black hawk helicopters in training exercises and in real operations in urban areas within the US.

             I guarantee this was not a training operation. Even BORTAC training doesn't turn their lights off on everything. SEALs in Coronado do not turn the lights off on their helicopters over the Tijuana estuary during training. We have plenty of interagency fake cities to practice breaches in. I see many types of exotic helicopters and planes every single day. The truth is, I hate helicopters and I try to stay out of them and I have had friends die in helicopter crashes.
            </p>
            <p>
             Point being, I think there is something significant, here.
            </p>
            <p>
             Best case scenario, the good guys did this and they got something really important, like the NXIVM hacks. This would assume there are established connections, but I'm not seeing anything I am ready to latch onto, yet. Girardi is definitely a Hillary donor. He definitely is involved with the buildings in the raid. If he is a bad guy, he has a really, really good cover. He represented a class action against Lockheed and won. He represented the Erin Brokovich case against a power company.
            </p>
            <p>
             Worst case scenario is Girardi was working for the good guys and they stole his leverage and it actually was a set back.
            </p>
            <p>
             However, he IS plugged into Hollywood, so it seems unlikely that he is a good guy.
            </p>
            <p>
             Either way, I'm still jumping back and forth between my current projects and looking into this one.

                Rates of cancer in the California town are not currently and have never actually been higher than other remote desert communities, John Morgan, a professor at Loma Linda University and one of Brockovich’s main detractors, has argued (PDF). Morgan’s research, based on studies done in 1997, 2000, and 2010, has found “no cancer excess” in Hinkley. Morgan has compared Brockovich to Don Quixote and inspired articles debunking links between cancer and environmental contaminants—the very basis of Brockovich’s fame. Bolstering Morgan’s case, a 2010 study by the California Cancer Registry also found that cancer rates in Hinkley were “unremarkable” between 1988 and 2008.

                 Case was dismissed. It was one person filing on behalf of himself, and not on behalf of the other class action petitioners. Basically, one person was asking for a lot more than his fair share from the collective pot.

              Maybe they don't want to push it up the HOT listing...don't want people seeing it? It's got 636 views but only 28 upvotes. The other submissions on this got two or three times that, and didn't contain much research at all. Very odd.

             Yes. And the hand painting on Yelp for the Guatemalan House of Culture was almost identical to the painted hands of that kid. That gave me the creeps. Were they both using the same clip art? Is it easy to find clip art of kids making illuminati signs?

              For this kind of stuff, you go to websites that sell photos, and look for the one you want via keyword search.

              Or you hire a photographer, and let them take exactly the kind of photo you want, according to your instructions.

             It may be just the legal world at that level is such a small world, but definitely a few connections between some of the lawyers representing Allison Mack, and the rest of the NXIVM members' law firms to Perkins Coie. There is a Girardi at Kobre &amp; Kim. Some movement between the firms where people connect them. But, these law firms can be fairly sprawling, so digging through is not a few minutes of research. Girardi is definitely  a Hillary donor.
            </p>
            <p>
             Girardi's businesses could be cut outs, given the number of them. Worth looking into when some news articles say he is only worth $11 Million, which seems low.

             A lot of trails. A lot happens, in LA, generally. But the ports are always going to be a big deal. Russian cocaine has been stopped in large quantities, as well. Diplomatic pouches, on the ocean and at borders. This on the tail of gold moving everywhere, too. It looks like a power shift or a turf war, but that could mean people are getting ripped off just as easily as it could mean actual justice is being served.

             </h2>
             <blockquote>
              <p>
               Agents from the FBI and U.S. Secret Service descended on homes in Burbank, La Crescenta and La Cañada Flintridge on Wednesday where they conducted early-morning raids on the residences.
              </p>
              <p>
               Authorities simultaneously carried out the raids around 6 a.m. after receiving federal search warrants for homes at 512 S. Via Montana in Burbank, 3122 Pontiac St. in La Crescenta and 1435 El Vago St. in La Cañada.
              </p>
              <p>
               Laura Eimiller, a spokeswoman for the Federal Bureau of Investigations, said the details and targets of the raids were unavailable because a judge sealed the contents of the warrants.
              </p>
              <p>
               Property records show that the homes in Burbank and La Cañada are owned by
               <strong>
                Alen and Dina Gharehbagloo
               </strong>
               , while the home in La Crescenta is owned by
               <strong>
                Robert and Dana Khudaverdyan
               </strong>
               . It’s unknown what connection, if any, the four had to the raids.
              </p>
              <p>
               Attempts to contact
               <strong>
                Alen Gharehbagloo
               </strong>
               were not returned as of press time.
              </p>
              <p>
               A number associated with Robert Khudaverdyan was answered by a woman who did not wish to identify herself and who said he was unavailable for comment.
              </p>
              <p>
               When the woman was informed about the raids, she responded, “OK, thank you, bye-bye” and promptly hung up the phone.
              </p>
              <p>
               Eimiller said the raids were conducted jointly by the FBI, Secret Service and Los Angeles Police Department.
              </p>
              <p>
               Requests for comment from the Secret Service were not returned by press time, and the LAPD directed all inquiries to the FBI.

               I don't know if you recall about the Vegas shooting, but a new union had just muscled into to take over the police and casino security, there. They were the ones who gave Jesus Campos the medal.

                 Two other fake police forces have gone down recently, too. It is pretty easy to set up a semi-legitimate DBA type of security force. Private investigating. Process serving. All the way to private land border security for people with tracts along the border.

               That is the Chinese corruption case. Huizar was having all kinds of heat, leading up to this. His wife, too.

              <p>
               Also, I think it is important to note El Chapo, who was arrested surrounding Hillary's defeat, who had CIA planes crash his his cocaine on them, was found guilty, today, in the wake of this event. A lot is happening in LA and it could be as simple as a massive organized crime round up.

             I read earlier today reporting of a "large military aircraft" over LA for 24 hours preceding the event.  Keep an eye out for that reference as it is not on the graphic.  Best place to run an operation like that is from 37,000 feet in one of these:

            And then shares an image of what looks like a search result for Erika Girardi of a Daily Mail piece that appears to link the Gerardis to NXIVM. I looked up
            <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-3898878/Erika-Girardi-showcases-lavish-lifestyle-aboard-private-jet.html">
             the Daily Mail article in question
            </a>
            , and there's nothing in it mentioning NXIVM. I think what must have happened is that MilSpec Ops Monkey must have seen the search result, not read the actual article, and not realized they were unrelated. He made a mistake.

            What I can't tell from Monkey's tweets is whether the similarity of the Guatemalan House of Culture pics and name to the NXIVM Rainbow Cultural Garden childcare stuff is what led him to excitedly jump on that search result that put Gerardi and NXIVM in the same digest of Daily Mail articles without fully vetting it.
           </p>
           <p>
            He seems to me like a pretty conscientious researcher, other than that one mistake.
           </p>
           <p>
            It's also possible that he made the mistake deliberately (a strategy Trump uses on a regular basis, it should be noted) to create hype for the story (which it certainly did), either to create buzz to get people researching another arm of the Cabal, or to color our reporting on the Special Forces "training" with the taint of Fake News.

             I caught all of that on MilSpec Monkey's Twitter. Gerardi's (sp) wife Erika, from the Real Housewives, never missed a beat posting on Twitter:
             <a href="https://twitter.com/erikajayne">
              https://twitter.com/erikajayne
             </a>
             - I would think if he was involved somehow, there would have been a social media disruption. Just an observation.
            </p>
            <p>
             All of MSpM posts are good analysis, other than the very odd referral to the takedown operators as....I was about to castigate him for this mistake, but he corrected himself:
             <a href="https://twitter.com/MilspecP/status/1093910408681922560">
              https://twitter.com/MilspecP/status/1093910408681922560
             </a>
            </p>
            <p>
             Everything I've looked at supports the hypothesis that this was real, not training:
            </p>
            <p>
             1) If this was a training exercise, it was extremely high risk and put civilians at risk. The military does not put multiple helos, flying on NVG, into domestic, civilian occupied areas to practice high risk maneuvers. Simulation would be preferred to this level of risk.
            </p>
            <p>
             2) Delta Force/CAG/1st SFOD-D/etc is a counterterrorism unit. They aren't going to send in the pipehitters to arrest a mid-level criminal for _____. To conduct domestic operations, there must have been a very imminent threat - financial, physical, or cyber, to get approval to send in Nightstalkers and Operators.
            </p>
            <p>
             3) Proximity to Wells Fargo offices (HQ is in SF). Major banking hubs are usually located along fiber/communication backbones for a variety of reasons. It is plausible this building sat on top of, or had access to, the fiber optics rights-of-way. Why is this important?
             <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2015/08/03/uncovering-echelon-the-top-secret-nsa-program-that-has-been-watching-you-your-entire-life/">
              https://techcrunch.com/2015/08/03/uncovering-echelon-the-top-secret-nsa-program-that-has-been-watching-you-your-entire-life/
             </a>
             - BLUF - Old tech allows fiber optic bundles to be TAPPED. Think robbing a bank with NSA-level tech.
            </p>
            <p>
             4) Physical proof of a breach. MSpM had a follower perform recon on the site, photos show windows are boarded. My .02 - Anytime I have been involved with a training activity which damaged civilian property, there was a check waiting the minute the exercise was over. Owners were paid. Contractors were already at the ready to fix the damage. Let's keep an eye to see if this damage is repaired immediately, or if the damage left by the assaulters remains in disrepair.
            </p>
            <p>
