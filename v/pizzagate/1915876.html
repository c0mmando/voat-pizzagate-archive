Many believe Nathan \'s abuse only occurred on the set of Clownhouse at the age of twelve. However the abuse was going on for many years. When Nathan\'s mother found out about the abuse on the set of Clownhouse she immediately took her child off the set. Unfortunately her son was under contract and was forced with the threat of being sued to return and finish the movie. The rape was filmed by Victor Salva and this film with other pictures of naked children was used to convict Salva in which he only served 15 months. There was a nude scene of the child in the movie which was allowed to remain in the film and of course Nathan Winters was banned from the premier.  However it was reported there was an effort to get Victor Salva out of his incarceration for the day to attend the premier. One of the main backers of this film the famous director Francis Ford Coppola when asked about the incident stated although it was a tragedy there was only a slight age difference between Salva and his victim. Salva was 29 the child was 12. Nathan&quot;s family sued and because of the enormous pressure by the powerful entities involved the family had to settle barely covering the lawyer\'s fees. Some of the film was filmed at Francis Ford Coppola s Nappa Valley Home. Some believe that some of the abuse occurred in this home. One would assume Coppola would of been outraged and would never work with Salva again. One would think he would do whatever he could to help the child who was raped.However that never happened.  What did happen according to reports at the time. Coppola gave Salva some money to live off of after he was released from prison. He also helped Salva to get his next Disney funded project Powder. When asked Francis Ford Coppola stated that Vicictor\'s art has merit and his past crimes should be separated from his artistic endeavors. During the premier Nathan Winters protested with some of his friends. It was than discovered that Disney was involved with the production of Powder and that they had no idea of Victor\'s predatory crimes. Later on Coppola produced the Jeepers Creepers series. Some believe these films are a artistic omage to Salva\'s predatory behavior. The creeper who in Jeepers Creepers 2 snatches up a child in the field to never to be seen again. A monster who sniffs and licks it\'s victims while only attacking those who have something it likes. Those who rape children often use their power and influence to groom and abuse their victims. By allowing Victor Salva to direct, the film industry is giving this predator the exact same vehicle that allowed him to abuse his one known victim. Nathan Winter\'s life will forever be changed. However Victor Salva served 15 months and shortly after resumed a lucrative directing career. Several years ago a movie that discussed the problem of child rape in Hollywood could not get distribution. The movie An Open Secret had many brave former child entertainers trying to expose the abuse in Hollywood. The movie received almost zero support from Hollywood however Jeepers Creepers 3 will receive world wide distribution and Salva and Coppola will profit again. I am not naive to the fact that boycotts seldom work. However maybe we need to bring back the double feature. Maybe the movie An Open Secret should play before the playing of Jeepers Creepers 3 to remind people of Salva\'s predatory crimes. Because it is one thing to direct a horror film it is quite another to live through one.</p>

            Read his movie Powder summary. Talking about rising above cruelty and being an elevated human being. Too ironically depraved... :(

            You make paragraphs by hitting the enter bar twice. That functions the same way as a carriage return on an old fashioned typewriter.  Don't wait for a crude commentator to chew you out with vulgarities as happened to me.  Great post.

            My drama teacher told us about an opportunity to be extras in the movie Powder so I went in for it. Nobody from our class ended up getting into it, thank God... we were only 11 and 12 years olds...

            Thank you for writing this so I know who to ban from any of their work past or future movies. Sick fucking freak. I actually enjoyed jeepers creepers to makes me sick to my stomach. Makes you wonder what other famous critically acclaimed movies have sick events behind them. The references to Geroge Lucas being a rapist in South Park makes me even question my love for good ol Star Wars sadly. Will never support a rapist in any shape or form including their professional work. Someone needs to make a thread on famous peices of work including movies, songs, any media who behind the work is run by monster pedophile rapists.
