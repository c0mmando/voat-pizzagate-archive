<h2>Nadia Murad is a Yazidi woman, a former ISIS sex slave. She was kidnapped by ISIS, sold as a sex slave, and raped and tortured until she was able to escape. She has been fighting the trafficking of Yezid girls and women ever since</h2>
<p>Dr Mukwege is a male Congolese gynaecologist who, along with his colleagues, has treated tens of thousands of victims.</p>
<p>Some 331 individuals and organisations were nominated for the prestigious peace award this year.</p>
<p><strong>The winners</strong> announced in the Norwegian capital Oslo on Friday <strong>won the award for their &quot;efforts to end the use of sexual violence as a weapon of war</strong>&quot;, Berit Reiss-Andersen, the Nobel committee chair, said. </p>
<p>The pair both made a &quot;crucial contribution to focusing attention on, and combating, such war crimes&quot;, Ms Reiss-Andersen <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-45759221">added</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Ms Murad, 25, said in a statement that many Yazidis would &quot;look upon this prize and think of family members that were lost, are still unaccounted for, and of the 1,300 women and children, which remain in captivity&quot;.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>Dr Mukwege was operating at his hospital when he heard he had won the prize.</em></p>
<p><em>&quot;I was in the operating room so when they started to make noise around [it] I wasn\'t really thinking about what was going on, and suddenly some people came in and told me the news,&quot; he told Norwegian newspaper VG.</em></p>
<p><strong>He dedicated his award to all women affected by sexual violence</strong></p>
<p>&quot;This Nobel prize is a recognition of the suffering and the failure to adequately compensate women who are victims of rape and sexual violence in all countries around the world,&quot; he told reporters gathered outside his clinic.</p>
<h1>Folks, please spam your normie real life friends and family and your Social Media friends with info about child trafficking and Pizzagate!!!! Most excellent redpill opportunity!!!! Please share on Twitter and Facebook!!!</h1>
<p><em>I will later add some links below you might want to use as redpill info.</em></p>
<p><strong>Who is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nadia_Murad">Nadia Murad</a>?</strong></p>
<p>Nadia Murad (...) endured three months as a sex slave at the hands of IS militants. She was bought and sold several times and subjected to sexual and physical abuse during her captivity.</p>
<p>After escaping, she became an activist for the Yazidi people, campaigning to help put an end to human trafficking and calling on the world to take a tougher line on rape as a weapon of war. </p>
<p>Nadia Murad was named the UN\'s first goodwill ambassador for survivors of human trafficking later that year. </p>
<h1>Whatever you might think about the Nobel committee, UN ambassadors, or the rise of ISIS, and the nations and politicians involved in its creation, this is still great news. It shows that the topic has gone mainstream, and you might want to refer to the Nobel Peace Prize when redpilling about child trafficking.</h1>
<p><em>Especially looking at you here, <a href="https://voat.co/user/letsdothis2">@letsdothis2</a> ;-)</em></p>
<p><strong>Who is Who is Denis Mukwege?</strong></p>
<p>He has spent decades helping rape victims in the Democratic Republic of Congo.</p>
<p>He and his colleagues are said to have treated about 30,000 rape victims, developing great expertise in the treatment of serious injuries sustained during sex assaults that were carried out as a weapon of war.</p>
<p>The 63-year-old has won a number of international prizes, including the 2008 UN Human Rights Prize, and was named African of the Year in 2009.</p>
<p>He lives under the permanent protection of UN peacekeepers at his hospital and has also previously called for a tougher line on rape as a weapon of war.</p>
<h1></h1>
<p><strong>Trigger warning</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Denis Mukwege in his own words</p>
<p>It was in 1999 that our first rape victim was brought into the hospital. After being raped, bullets had been fired into her genitals and thighs.</p>
<p>I thought that was a barbaric act of war but the real shock came three months later. Forty-five women came to us with the same story, they were all saying: &quot;People came into my village and raped me, tortured me.&quot;</p>
<p>Other women came to us with burns. They said that after they had been raped, chemicals had been poured on their genitals.</p>
<p>I started to ask myself what was going on. These weren\'t just violent acts of war, but part of a strategy. You had situations where multiple people were raped at the same time, publicly - a whole village might be raped during the night. In doing this, they hurt not just the victims but the whole community, which they force to watch.</p>
<p>The result of this strategy is that people are forced to flee their villages, abandon their fields, their resources, everything. It\'s very effective.</p>

            We are NOT winning, the trafficking torturing murdering and organ harvesting by the spook agencies, celebrities and government continues unabated. Nobel peace prize is a bad joke. No arrest made of our systems crimes. Why would they arrest themselves? You do crimes for Rothschilds cartel, you are protected not arrested and tried.

            Tight now the Nobel Peace Prize has become Kabuli Theatre at best, and a Flag for who is a Deep State asset at worse.

            Not saying she is guilty, but she was "given" this for a reason that she will never be allowed to know.

             I invite critical comments on awarding the Nobel Peace Prize to them.
            </p>
            <p>
             I am familar with the background research we did on the UN, and other people serving as UN ambassadors, and agree with you that Murad has been instrumentalized by the UN, although she is a genuine survivor, and undoubtly suffers from PTSD.
            </p>
            <p>
             But I also know
             <em>
              how important
             </em>
             this is for redpilling normies, and I know that many campaigners against child trafficking and rape in armed conflicts will see this as their work finally getting acknowledged.
            </p>
            <p>
             IIRC, her work has led Australia and two other countries to provide special trauma treatments for trafficked girls and women, and giving the prize to her and the Congolese doctor will allow us and other campaigners against child trafficking to be able to refer to this award, to show that the topic isn't some random conspiracy theory.

              Zero normies are red pilled from hearing about a nobel peace prize awarded to a woman who has a genric backstory of fighting "rape and trafficking of women and children". Are you not aware that lip service is publicly made about fighting "trafficking" every year? Nobody heard she received the award and then though PG is real.

               I always forget that you live in a backwater village, DTM. :-) This has been all over the internet and in printed papers worldwide. And please, by all means, do a little background research before you claim she has 'a generic backstory', you're really embarassing your handlers.

               I hear you. This is one of the things that have been difficult to process while investigating Pizzagate - that charities and UN organizations that I previously thought to be genuinely devoted to good causes turned out to be bad actors.

                You don't investigate PG, you cover for the system. Rothschild owns the system. Alefantis is a Rothschild and Trump is a Rothschild stooge. You allow your other mod to sensor good threads without protest and approve of threads that are centered on attack users. You are a pedo protecting mod and a shill.
