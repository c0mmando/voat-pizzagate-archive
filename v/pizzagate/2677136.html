            The late Richard Sipe informed bishop in 2016 of McCarrick's sexual predation
           </p>
           <p>
            SAN DIEGO, Calif. (ChurchMilitant.com) - San Diego Bishop Robert McElroy was told of Abp. Theodore McCarrick's sexual predation as early as July 2016, but remained silent.
           </p>
           <p>
            Richard Sipe, the renowned expert in clerical sex abuse who passed away Friday, published his private correspondence with McElroy proving that the bishop was made aware of McCarrick's sexual harassment of seminarians.
           </p>
           <p>
            The 13-page letter, dated July 28, 2016 — which Sipe notes was "hand delivered" on August 30 — began: "It was clear to me during our last meeting in your office, although cordial, that you had no interest in any further personal contact. It was only after that I sent you a letter copied to my contacts in DC and Rome."
           </p>
           <p>
            Cardinal Theodore McCarrick has been reported by numerous seminarians and priests of sexual advances and activity. A settlement with one priest was effected by Stephen Rubino, Esq.
           </p>
           <p>
            In that record the operation of McCarrick in sexual activity with three priests is described. Correspondence from "Uncle Ted," as he asked to be called, is included. One of the principals is now a lawyer who left the priesthood, two men remain in the priesthood, but refuse to speak publicly despite the fact that the settlement document is open. One priest was told by the chancery office, "if you speak with the press we will crush you."

             <p>
              In 2014, Perozich announced to his parish that he was not going to attend a convocation of priests because the speaker was Father Timothy Radcliffe, OP, who has said sodomy can express Christ's "self-gift."

               And when they like you and you've become a liability, they give you a positive recommendation to pedo heaven (Disneyworld). Do you think that's a form of "evangelization", sending your messenger out to make converts to your perverted Gospel?

                God what a sick perverted system they have devised.  I cant wait till all of this comes out.  Not everyone will believe for there are always those with Closed Minds and Eyes.  I read something today about the Conservative Bishops trying to push francis out.  They want ratizinger back.  He is a rapist too.  They don't care.  It's like politics.  That's what its all about.

             Yep, signed it. I think what complicitclergy wants is more  childhood survivor testimony against McCarrick to crop up.

              People have had enough and with the Pen diocese news coming out, they will be inclined to come forward.  We need to out all of them and not stop posting until people say Enough!  We also must stand up for Victims and make people realize it is not their fault.  Not their fault that it happened nor that they waited so long.  The abusers love to demoralize them.  No More.

               And when the subject of child abuse is raised even though the victim  might be famous and deceased (like 
Aretha Franklin), I don't think people should shove it under the rug or criticize others who publicize it like the blogger reaction to the Mirror article on her (see below). The more sunshine the child abuse receives the less it will flourish in the dark.

               "She was 13 when she became pregnant and 14 when she gave birth to her first son, named Clarence, after her father – who did not chastise her, perhaps remembering that in 1940, during his marriage to Barbara, he had fathered a child with a 13-year-old member of his Memphis congregation. At 16 Aretha gave birth to another son, Edward; the identity of neither father was ever revealed."

                How horribly sad.  Yes, they all try to hide their past because their agents want to make them stars, and we can not have none of that, even though it is not their fault.  She must have done something, as they all say.
