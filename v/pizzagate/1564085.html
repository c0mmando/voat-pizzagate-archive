<p>I did not verify the information in this post. Because the original author of this research leaked this with care, tread carefully. The OP either got scared of is spreading disinformation. In the original thread phone numbers are mentioned, I removed those, no one should call anyone..

<p>I believe we may have found where the #PizzaGate children of Washington DC are being housed ... Location Maps Provided... This is going to be a little long winded, and I apologise for that, but it\'s vital information for us to connect the dots.</p>
<p>This is what we know - as Fact …</p>
<p>James Alefantis IS connected to the ‘New Hope Academy’ at 7009 Varnum Street, MD Hyattsville. For those not familiar with the Washington area, Hyattsville is a close urban suburb of Washington DC. <a href="http://www.spokeo.com/MD/Hyattsville/7009-Varnum-St">http://www.spokeo.com/MD/Hyattsville/7009-Varnum-St</a></p>
<p>The children are most likely being packed into homes along Varnum Street, Hyattsville, surrounding the academy, and along Finns Lane, Lanham Maryland 20706, where the previous business manager (deceased) of the academy, Joseph T Scheve lived.</p>
<p>James Alefantis\' Pegasus Museum / Kiddies Playground is virtually slap bang in the middle of the two locations. 7.75 miles from the Academy in Hyattsville and 8.25 miles from Finns Lane, Lanham. per <a href="http://distance-cities.com">http://distance-cities.com</a> .</p>
<p>The academy is described on its website as a private international school. Photo’s show children, some very young, that look Haitian, African etc. <a href="http://www.newhopeacademy.org/MD-private-school/photo-tour.php#">http://www.newhopeacademy.org/MD-private-school/photo-tour.php#</a>  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Hope_Academy">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Hope_Academy</a></p>
<p>The academy has a branch operation in Haiti and promotes a scholarship program, of sorts, called the Gambia Project, or Gambia@newhopeacademy.org, in partnership with Women’s Federation for World Peace, which it notes, “greatly helps with facilitating this program”.</p>
<p>WFFWP is headed by Mrs Hak Ja Han Moon, the wife of deceased Rev Moon of the Unification Church/Moon Cult.</p>
<p>A quick search tells us that the New Hope/Hope Academies are funded by the ‘UN’ through the Women’s Federation for World Peace. They exist throughout the US and around the world.</p>
<p>WFWPI is described on an academy website as an ‘NGO, (non-government organization), in general consultative status with the Economic and Social Council of the UN’.</p>
<p>The Moonies Cult and its Unification Church has known deep ties to Washington; intelligence agencies around the world and is buddy with the Bush and Biden families and convicted pedophile, former Speaker of the House, Hastert. Here’s a picture of George and Barbara Bush with Mrs Moon taken from the New Hope Website for the Solomon Islands. <a href="http://www.wfwpaustralia.org/words-from-the-founder">http://www.wfwpaustralia.org/words-from-the-founder</a> </p>
<p>Interestingly, New Hope Academy references the United States Central Intelligence Agency on its webpage as seen here. <a href="http://www.gambiaproject.org/scholarships.html">http://www.gambiaproject.org/scholarships.html</a> </p>
<p>To understand New Hope Academy’s connection to the shadow government, via the WFWPI and Unification Church, have a careful read of these two telling articles:</p>
<p><a href="https://newrepublic.com/article/115512/unification-church-profile-fall-house-moon">https://newrepublic.com/article/115512/unification-church-profile-fall-house-moon</a></p>
<p><a href="http://www.larouchepub.com/other/2002/2949moonification.html">http://www.larouchepub.com/other/2002/2949moonification.html</a></p>
<p>So where are the children James Alefantis deals with likely kept/housed?</p>
<p>It\'s highly likely they are kept in neighbouring homes around New Hope Academy along Varnum Street, Hyattsville. Open this link and scroll down to see the number of residents listed in each of the single residential family homes that make up Varnum Street. Some of the homes are listed as having one bathroom ie. 7111 Varnum Street and happen to service 25 residents. <a href="http://www.spokeo.com/MD/Hyattsville/7009-Varnum-St">http://www.spokeo.com/MD/Hyattsville/7009-Varnum-St</a> </p>
<p>Children are also most likely kept in homes neighbouring 7292 Finns Lane, Lanham, MD 20706 which is listed as the residential address of one Joseph T Scheve, Business Manager of the New Hope Educational Institute Inc and Nellie Hubbard (wife/divorced).</p>
<p>Note how 40 residents are listed at neighbouring property, 7308 Finns Lane. Next door, 28 residents and so on…Again, these are single family residences. <a href="http://www.spokeo.com/MD/Lanham/7292-Finns-Ln7292">http://www.spokeo.com/MD/Lanham/7292-Finns-Ln7292</a> Finns Lane, Lanham, MD 20706 <a href="http://www.spokeo.com/MD/Lanham/7292-Finns-Ln#expanded_map">http://www.spokeo.com/MD/Lanham/7292-Finns-Ln#expanded_map</a></p>
<p>Behind Scheve/Hubbard’s address and at 7309 Riverdale Rd Lanham MD 20706, is a complex listed on Google as a Baptist Church which has a large carpark area and plenty of bush secluding it – interesting in that it’s very similar in environ to the academy location/setup in Hyattsville. <a href="http://www.spokeo.com/MD/Lanham/7309-Riverdale-Rd#expanded_map">http://www.spokeo.com/MD/Lanham/7309-Riverdale-Rd#expanded_map</a> </p>
<p>Connection to Pegasus Museum and James Alefantis. The ‘Estate of Joseph T Scheve’ and ‘Nellie T Hubbard’ are both listed as parties on publicly available court documents involved in the transfer of the property known as ‘Pegasus Museum’, at 3518 11 St NW Washington DC, to James Alefantis.</p>
<p>Castellum Alefantis LLC (James Alefantis) borrowed to purchase the property at 3518 11St, NW Washington DC (otherwise now known as ‘Pegasus Museum’) from the Estate of Joseph T Scheve. Nellie T Hubbard is listed as Trustee of the Estate. Death <a href="http://analysed.com">http://analysed.com</a> shows a Joseph T Scheve was born on July 08, 1944 and died November 05, 2008, approximately 64.4 years of age.</p>

<p>As an aside, publicly available divorce court documents show that Scheve was awared custody over two ‘biological’ children resulting from of his marriage to Hubbard (established by DNA testing). <a href="https://archive.is/MskhU">https://archive.is/MskhU</a> .</p>
<p>Videos and Reading … to appreciate the wider ring…</p>
<p>Here’s 2 videos showing Hope Academy in Haiti.</p>

<p>These articles, on the House of Moon, tells of a world involving sex rituals, brainwashing, foreign spies, intelligence agencies, Biden offspring, the Bushes and the Unification Church\'s war-torn first family.</p>

<p>This blog discussion, started Nov 2013, on the House of Moon, includes interviews of family members reporting the massive deception - drugs, violence etc, within the cult. <a href="https://whyweprotest.net/threads/the-fall-of-the-house-of-moon-sex-rituals-spies-biden-family-moar.114999/">https://whyweprotest.net/threads/the-fall-of-the-house-of-moon-sex-rituals-spies-biden-family-moar.114999/</a></p>
<p>Wonder if we can find out - Who owns the property, 7009 Varnum Street, Hyattsville, Maryland, where the academy is located? And get some background on Nellie T Hubbard, the Trustee for her former husband’s Estate. I have her age at 53 but there isn’t much to find on the net apart from divorce court documents and that she resided with Joseph T Scheve at 7292 Finns Lane, Lanham, MD 20706. Wonder if ‘Nellie’ is a product of the CIA/related to L Ron Hubbard? A ‘Nellie’ features in Hubbard’s book, Writers of the Future. <a href="https://books.google.com.au/books?id=oE5jlaDEWGIC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false">https://books.google.com.au/books?id=oE5jlaDEWGIC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false</a> </p>

<p>I posted little snippets 2 days ago on voat - all archived and they were taken down very quickly - scrubbed off the net. Google moved quickly as did archive.ie. Know we have hit a major artery. What to do now?</p>
<hr />
<p>My response : Very interesting research. Do you have links to the posts that were taken down? Have you spoken to the mods about this yet?</p>
<hr />
<p>User response: Yes and no. The children are being packed into homes along Finns Lane, Lanham and Varnum Street, Hyattsville MD. The &quot;Community Baptist Church&quot; backs onto homes in Finns Lane. Google earth shows multiple security warning signs of camera surveillance outside of 7292 Finns Lane, Lanham, MD 20706 at the start of the Lane. (Address given on the internet of the business manager of New Hope Institute/Academy). Finns Lane flows directly into Harkins Road to the IRS &gt; <a href="http://vigilantcitizen.com/sinistersites/sinister-sites-irs-headquarters-maryland/_20706_M59678-95338">http://vigilantcitizen.com/sinistersites/sinister-sites-irs-headquarters-maryland/_20706_M59678-95338</a> I am confident I have found something but have tired of the shills on voat and deleting and starting new accounts each time to shake them. Also archived material offered is lost or scrubbed from the net.</p>',

           So where are the children James Alefantis deals with likely kept/housed?
          </p>
          <p>
           It's highly likely they are kept in neighbouring homes around New Hope Academy along Varnum Street, Hyattsville. Open this link and scroll down to see the number of residents listed in each of the single residential family homes that make up Varnum Street. Some of the homes are listed as having one bathroom ie. 7111 Varnum Street and happen to service 25 residents.

           </a>
          </p>
          <p>
           Children are also most likely kept in homes neighbouring 7292 Finns Lane, Lanham, MD 20706 which is listed as the residential address of one Joseph T Scheve, Business Manager of the New Hope Educational Institute Inc and Nellie Hubbard (wife/divorced).
          </p>
          <p>
           Note how 40 residents are listed at neighbouring property, 7308 Finns Lane. Next door, 28 residents and so on…Again, these are single family residences.

           Behind Scheve/Hubbard’s address and at 7309 Riverdale Rd Lanham MD 20706, is a complex listed on Google as a Baptist Church which has a large carpark area and plenty of bush secluding it – interesting in that it’s very similar in environ to the academy location/setup in Hyattsville.

           Connection to Pegasus Museum and James Alefantis. The ‘Estate of Joseph T Scheve’ and ‘Nellie T Hubbard’ are both listed as parties on publicly available court documents involved in the transfer of the property known as ‘Pegasus Museum’, at 3518 11 St NW Washington DC, to James Alefantis.

           Wonder if we can find out - Who owns the property, 7009 Varnum Street, Hyattsville, Maryland, where the academy is located? And get some background on Nellie T Hubbard, the Trustee for her former husband’s Estate. I have her age at 53 but there isn’t much to find on the net apart from divorce court documents and that she resided with Joseph T Scheve at 7292 Finns Lane, Lanham, MD 20706. Wonder if ‘Nellie’ is a product of the CIA/related to L Ron Hubbard? A ‘Nellie’ features in Hubbard’s book, Writers of the Future.

           I posted little snippets 2 days ago on voat - all archived and they were taken down very quickly - scrubbed off the net. Google moved quickly as did archive.ie. Know we have hit a major artery. What to do now?
          </p>
          <hr/>
          <p>
           My response : Very interesting research. Do you have links to the posts that were taken down? Have you spoken to the mods about this yet?
          </p>
          <hr/>

           User response: Yes and no. The children are being packed into homes along Finns Lane, Lanham and Varnum Street, Hyattsville MD. The "Community Baptist Church" backs onto homes in Finns Lane. Google earth shows multiple security warning signs of camera surveillance outside of 7292 Finns Lane, Lanham, MD 20706 at the start of the Lane. (Address given on the internet of the business manager of New Hope Institute/Academy). Finns Lane flows directly into Harkins Road to the IRS &gt;

           I am confident I have found something but have tired of the shills on voat and deleting and starting new accounts each time to shake them. Also archived material offered is lost or scrubbed from the net.

            The person who posted it needs to learn how to write something that isn't an incoherent mess, then they won't be dismissed as a shill or as yet another person declaring Obama is actually Will Smith clone living with lizard people underneath the white house (which they go on to prove with a video of Katy Perry playing ping pong.)

            I understand the format of Voat overall and get that posts fall off or get moved, scrubbed, deleted, fall off the radar for various legit reasons. But it's frustrating in this particular subverse due to the nature of what we're doing here. Good leads get lost.  I mention this and suggest ways to change this and am reminded that's not how Voat works and posts aren't normally deleted as a general rule but the influx of puzzagaters "fucked all that up".
           </p>
           <p>
            I get it...I'm newer to Voat &amp; this is just one of many and doesn't define Voat. But this is one of the big hubs of the investigation, like it or not.

            I don't know what the tie in here might be but for those who are not aware the South Korean president was impeached about a month ago after it was revealed she was involved both in a cult that had similar themes that also spoke of child sacrifice. Millions of protesters took to the streets for days our media completely blacked it out. They are our ally and a democratically elected governmenment. For those not following this is historical and ties in the connections since GWB Sr., Barbara Bush (Pierce) research this!!!
The history of the elite secret societies, banksters, the Vatican takeover of USA, WW11, the founding of CIA with Nazi war criminals, JFK speech against them, the astounding cover ups.....blackmail. The name in this now being linked to L. Ron Hubbard (Scientology) massive false religion by CIA to control Hollywood through confession, threats, cp, (view Leah Remini). The Attorney mentioned in the Podesta emails as possible replacement for Scalia on Supreme Court was attorney in case against Hubbard and Scientology.This is huge.

            People from all over the Moonie-spectrum, from H1 supporters to Sanctuary members to some level-headed FFWPU members, have noted that there is something strangely familiar and relevant to the situation of the Unification Church in the recent scandal exploding about the South Korean President, Park Geun-hye.

            - Did you notice on the Google Streetview of 7292 Finns lane, the car in driveway has Florida, not MD (or DC or VA) tags on it?  And Google didn't blur it out...FAIL. This is not unusual to see in the DC area, but given the role FL might play in trafficking (water access) and I-95N, this might be the missing link.  Can anyone run a license plate?  It would appear to say PF6 62P, but I'm not with image processing software at the moment.

            This whole line of thought seems very tenuous to me. How is JA involved in New Hope Academy? Why is quoting statistics from The World Factbook, a CIA publication, supposed to be interesting at all? Not every place with "Hope" in the name is going to be related to a specific school. Having met some Moonies or worked with them somewhere doesn't make you agree with their cult. Why is it suspicious that someone lives near a baptist church?
           </p>
           <p>
            It sounds a lot more like the reasoning went the other way to give Voat a false lead, and get someone to pester the Sceves.

            Isn't anyone scared that these pedophiles may be on voat and can see everything being discussed.  Isn't it kind  of scary that they would have a heads up on all of this.  Just wondering.

             They find safety in secrecy. We find safety in transparency and openness. also consider that dismantling and moving a child trafficking operation because someone is on them is an expensive business. they have put money, time and effort into sourcing and buying property, sorting logistics, etc. at the least we are an expensive nuisance, and at the most a considerable risk to their operation.

            As for the number of residences in the houses, if you view the "Neighbors" section you do get strange high numbers of residents, however if you select one of those homes the number changes to a normal number of residents.  This must just be a flaw in the web pages.
            <br/>
            Edit: I stand corrected the 7308 Finns Lane address does seem to have a fair amount of residents (16) all with non western sounding surnames.
            <br/>
            Edit: However, if these are "trafficked" kids why would they be listed as living in these homes?  That makes no sense.

             I would be very surprised if the names were names of trafficked kids.  By intuition I expect it would be something else.  It's odd, though, so dig dig dig!

             Some single-family residences are rented out to large numbers of unrelated immigrants.  They live crowded but cheaply while the owner gets extraordinary level of income to pay mortgage and acquire other properties.

            I don't know if this is a lead, but, when I read some of the articles about the Moon cult, specifically the "Biden offspring" comment. I went digging. Turns out that the Bidens were seemingly involved in business dealings with "Dr James Park, one of Korean Unification Church founder Reverand Sun Myung Moon’s sons-in-law". 2 courts cases resulted in the failed dealings, and Joe Biden was just being sworn in as VP at the time. Both court cases settled out of court under confidential terms:
            <a href="https://ftalphaville.ft.com/2009/05/01/55288/the-politics-of-paradigm/">

            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            So, in the footer of the article I was reading, it drops the Frank Biden nugget of entertainment: "Joe and James Biden knew the center well: A judge had sent their brother, Frank, there after a string of arrests, one of them for trying to flee a Blockbuster with DVDs shoved down his pants."
           </p>
           <p>
            So, I jump to Frank Biden, just to see if his legal troubles went beyond movies down his pants. Turns out he was in trouble before but seems to be recovered and on a straight path now. He ends up running the "Mavericks High" Charter school program in FL:

            Strange quote from the article: “I’m a salesman,” Biden says. “I’m nothing but a P.T. Barnum for these kids.” Probably nothing...

            So, I look into Mavericks high school and notice that it's pretty terrible. As in extra police needed and the school has to pay for the extra police. Shootings, theft, underage drinking... oh, and the Principal gets caught in a car full of weed with her shirt unbuttoned while with an 18 year old student:

            But Herman noted the bar for criminal charges to be filed is higher than that needed to file a civil lawsuit.

            Doubt there's much here. Just thought I'd share the line of thinking it case it triggered any deeper dives.

            Just for the record, this information is not being censored by mods on this sub. We reached out directly to several different researchers with a proven track record of skill and rigor and asked them to look into it. We are concerned this could be planted information that is part of a disinformation campaign to discredit pizzagate investigators. We have not yet heard anything back.

             <p>
              To begin, we are discussing the genetic anomaly which occurs both in the eye of George Soros, Madeline Mccann and members of the Rothschild family. One of the moderators of this forum has correctly pointed out the rarity of this condition here:
             </p>
             <p>
              If 1 or 2% have it, then this could easily be coincidence. However, it is MUCH more rare than that. This is an extremely unlikely coincidence (although we must acknowledge there's still a possibility it's a coincidence).

              OK, So the genetics of the condition are thus.... The PAX6 transcription factor within our DNA is responsible for the congenital mutation within the Iris we see on the aforementioned, for the PAX6 transcription factor plays a major role in the development of our eyes, brains, in particular our olfactory (sense of smell). Many of you will be aware our olfactory is responsible for some of our oldest and deepest memories. This is because the olfactory, unlike the functions of the other senses, is processed uniquely through more extensive channels of the brain.
             </p>
             <p>
              It should also be noted, the olfactory bulb is responsible for the production of stemcells.

              That's right, adult neurogensis.

             <p>
              That is to say, stemcells within the adult brain. I would hazard such a discovery, as it is known can regenerate organ tissue, would be a fundamental element to human cloning.

              Now how does this relate to pizzagate?

              ~~~Well if we consider the programs of the Nazis, to create a super race, we might consider which particular genetics might be considered the holy grail for eugenicists. This eye condition is found in the art of many of the alleged perpetrators of pizzagate. discussed here

Afterward, the world will resurface anew and fertile, the surviving and returning gods will meet, and the world will be repopulated by two human survivors."

               To me the OP should be reshaped. When it goes : * This is what we know - as Fact … James Alefantis IS connected to the ‘New Hope Academy*’ The only connection I know of is that what became Pegasus was purchased to these people (possibly at a cost that didn't match the usual market price but this is yet to be proven). Not a "connection" to me or a very far-fetched one.
              </p>
              <p>
               It doesn't mean that the rest of the research is irrelevant but honnestly doesn't encourage to explore further this lead.

               In passing Nazi eugenism seems to be a pleaonasm for many. I encourage those to read about the social eugenism policies in US and elsewhere before and (could be wrong here) after 2d world war. Eugenism was official and not edgy scientific pratice before 2WW. Even today many widely agreed pre-natal medical practises amount to eugenism.

             Would you mention that in a separate stickied post? You don't need to list each post and researcher, but just claiming that you are doing this helps to relieve tension, and build trust.

             If you want, I could write up a post, and then have you sticky it.

             My question is ... is there a way to save different versions of a webpage URL in archive.is?

            <p>
             A page is overwritten every time it's archived.  Perhaps I just don't know a way around it.

             It is an issue, good point
some additional methods since I don't know archive alternatives.
screenshot with url in browserbar, create hash and post in blockchain
run screenrecording software as extra archiving methond.

            Pla Read the review and check out the pic for the movie Neon Demons.... this is some sick shit...  Has anyone heard of this movie?
           </p>
           <p>
            Hollywood and satanic rituals. Go figure.  Bringing this shit into the mainstream.  Just blows my mind.
This was written in June 2016.  Im sure the movie was released with the thinking that Hilary would be the next president.

            The Community Bible Baptist Church has all the markings of a legitimate Christian Church.  It's definitely not Unification.  Look over their web page but please don't disturb these innocent people. I have significant experience in researching "Christian" Churches for aberrations.  (I put Christian in parenthesis because I have often discover Churches that pretend to be Christian but are anything but).

            Just want to be careful of a common mistake - not all "New Hope" organizations will be related. It is seemingly a Christian term (though I only previously knew it from Star Wars). In Spanish, it is Nueva Esperanza.
           </p>
           <p>
            If you want to link two "New Hope" or "Hope" organizations - make sure there is a clear secondary link - person, address, etc.

              I absolutely agree with JrSlimss, "New Hope" is a term found very often in legitimate Christian circles.  The "New Hope" 7009 Vanum St, is anything but a "new hope", it is more closely related to the Unification church, which is a Mooney thing.
