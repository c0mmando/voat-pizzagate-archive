<p>David Icke\'s the biggest secret (1999)</p>
<p>Two interesting things that jumped out of me in chapter 16 , \'where have the kids gone\'. Was the MK Ultra stuff, then he goes on to talk about  use of prescription drugs as mind control..</p>
<p>&quot;They include the use of mind controlling drugs on servicemen at the Bethesda Naval Hospital in Maryland (since exposed in a television documentary). One of the experiments is in Haiti where the Vodoun cult, a CIA-front, has turned most of the people into little more than zombies.</p>
<p>Prozac is a drug that constantly appears in research into these matters and it is not confined to individual mind control projects, it is being issued like confetti by doctors who serve the profits and ambitions of the drug cartel instead of their patient’s wellbeing. It is one of the world’s most prescribed drugs for depression and, as I write, Eli Lilly is seeking approval to market a version of Prozac for children in peppermint and orange flavours. Already some 400,000 youngsters under 18 are being treated with Prozac in the United States alone and that is just the start. This is a mass mind control operation we are seeing here, creating a race of zombies like the ones in Haiti.&quot;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&quot;When little children say they were abused by Mickey Mouse or the Devil it makes them even less likely to be believed. One woman who contacted me said that her father sexually abused her while wearing a Devil’s head and it was a long time before she realized that her father was responsible. The stories of the people I have talked to, and the accounts of others I have read, tell of events that are beyond comprehension or, at least, they would be if they were not actually happenin&quot;</p>

<p>So I am loosely connecting this to the Xanax we saw  jimmy comet\'s Instagram and the panda mask, I am not going to claim there is any link but I am just throwing these two information rich sources out there so we can identify the idiosyncrasies..behaviours, traits and patterns of what we are trying to look for.</p>',
