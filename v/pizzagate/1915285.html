            I will say that when I heard that heard Clinton was going to choose Brooklyn for her Headquarters that was one of the only neighborhoods that made sense.  Part of it is geography.
Since that is the land closest to Manhattan all transportation goes through there.   So it's accessible by bridge, highway and subway.  It has office space.   It's an affluent area, so it has good restaurants and stuff like that. If you have a staff that would be moving to Brooklyn to work for you, they would be able to get there from almost any neighborhood in Brooklyn.

              Still not finding info on Pacific Street Tunnel.   Is this an active subway line?   Because there are no stops near Columbia Street.  Can you show me what you mean? I was wondering if meant the Red Hook Piers.  They are on NY Harbor near the Statue of Liberty and not the East River.  And these are indeed the closest cargo piers.  This in the waterfront from On the Waterfront where Brando could been a contender.

            First she shilled the BS she wrote that was posted on Quora dot com. Now it appears that Psycho is using a new venue, Medium dot com.

            One of the REAL assets on this forum, PizzaGate Bot, was run off by the OP.

            In case it seems important, I wanted to share that I have relatives who live near Omaha, and get the local news. A few years back, it was reported that Stratfor had opened up a branch, if that's what you call it, in Omaha. The news first announced when the deal was secured, as a win for locals who need jobs, and later they covered the ceremony when the building was finished. Strangely though, I've not been able to find anything about this online.
           </p>
           <p>
            Tldr-there's a somewhat secret Stratfor hub in the Omaha/Offutt area.

            Are we supposed to be impressed this person is from MIT?  Her analysis is pretty shallow and unconvincing.  This analysis suffers from the same cardinal sin as this board.   Assuming that Podesta was speaking in code.

            This is not a reasonable question, if there is no code being used.

            This language is very clear to anyone who works in tech.  They seem to be talking about testing software. 
  It's quite common in the software world to  give major builds of your code a label like PIZZA, so you can tell if bugs are happening in all version or just the PIZZA version or happening in MEATLOAF, but not in PIZZA.  These are usually internal names, but Google has decided to use them as the official names of Android versions.  The current version is NOUGAT.   Previous versions included CUPCAKE and JELLY BEAN.

            He did not.  His use of subterranean makes perfect sense.   It's not a slip up, it's not a mistake, it's a metaphor that he returns to several times. He contrasting what he called a "subterranean media ecosystem" (places like Infowars) and the "above ground" mainstream media.    It's absolutely clear what he is talking about.  VOAT is absolutely part of this subterranean world.

              Yes.  Based on the fact I've not seen one reasonable piece of evidence that indicates that.  And I've seen a lot of lies told trying to indicate that.  Pasta with walnut sauce is one of those lies.

             I agree in principle with your first point, RweSure.
            </p>
            <p>
             However, the fact that so many people "miss his metaphor" is EXACTLY why he should directly address the items that appear to be code in his emails.
            </p>
            <p>
             John Podesta did not protect his emails; the toothpaste is out of the tube and everyone has read them. By ignoring the situation, refusing to address people's concerns (thousands of people's), and most of all allowing powerful friends in the MSM, social media and tech companies to participate in the most brutal censorship crackdown in modern times, Podesta has fed Pizzagate suspicion in a spectacular display of public relations incompetence.
            </p>
            <p>
             You are here every day advocating he continue that obvious error in judgement. A wise friend would counsel him to explain his metaphors,
             <em>
              in detail
             </em>
             and lay people's concerns to rest. Many people here would love to hear a logical explanation that allowed them to lay their concerns to rest and move on with their lives.

           <p>
            Why would lots of fog be rolling in?  You are getting imaginative aren't you?  A lot of writers used to live there, so I'm sure it's in several books already. Brooklyn Heights is also the backdrop for many, many movies.  Because there are streets with old houses that still look like the 1920's, it's a favorite place to shoot period pieces.  You just have to bring in old time cars and get the costumes right.
           </p>
           <p>
            This street is used in movies all the time.  I think it was in JLO video recently.

            Uh, whut?   Why would that give you nightmares?  Seriously?       It's a ventilation system.  Why is that frightening?.   It's much nicer looking that the ones they built for the new Second Ave Subway.   Apparently those subway grates that blew up Marilyn Monroe's skirt are no longer up to code.

           <p>
            As I mentioned that Atlantic Tunnel goes nowhere.    What piers are you talking about with the Pacific Street tunnel?
           </p>
           <p>
            Another problem for you tunnel theory is Brooklyn Heights is up on Heights.  Atlantic Ave is the border and that is probably sea level, but the subway tunnels in Brooklyn Heights are heading under the river just as the Heights rise up and thus the subways end up hundreds of feet below ground. At Clark Street you take one of the longest elevator rides I've ever been one to get the steps that lead down to the platform.

             The internet has made it easier for children to be bought and sold online — using some of the same technology and websites that people use to sell their bike, find a roommate or look for a local garage sale. We cannot arrest our way out of this problem. Law enforcement simply doesn’t have enough resources to navigate the massive online commercial sex market to find children and identify their traffickers.

           <p>
            That manpower situation may be sadly true, but plenty of time for the MSM to deal in celebrity nonsense ... !!
           </p>
           <p>
            But education of parents as to who our sexual abusers of children actually are to prevent kidnappings would 
certainly help us all.  They are MALE and according to studies they are heterosexual males.
           </p>
           <p>
            There seems to be two categories of pedophiles  -- those who occur based on sexual abuse in the 
home by fathers, grandfathers, uncles, male cousins -- 
and those who are produced by sexual abuse/torture by MKULTRA to do their dirty work for them....
           </p>
           <p>
            but also there are what are called "situational" pedophiles who are heterosexual males who prefer
sexual relations with females, but when they are not available, they will assault and sexually
abuse a child, even an infant.
           </p>
           <p>
            It will actually take immense education of parents in this society in order to prevent thse
kidnappings.
           </p>
           <p>
            Of course, the poverty situation in the US today with 43 million Americans living in poverty and 
with America having the highest rates of children living in poverty is a cause of broken homes 
and orphaned children which makes them more vulnerable to this trafficking.
           </p>
           <p>
            Also, it is beyond question that victims of MKULTRA point to incidents where they and
other children were being sexually abused by fathers and then a turn-over or a kidnapping
was arranged to put them under the control of CIA/MKULTRA.
           </p>
           <p>
            Education is certainly a place to start.
           </p>
           <p>
            I've posted this information previously, but if anyone would like me to repeat
the information on the study, I will be happy to do so -- 
Basically ... Heterosexual males are 100X more likely to sexually abuse a child than a homosexual male . . .

              QUOTE . . .
             </p>
             <p>
              In order to protect young children from pedophiles and those who are attracted to
 11 to 14 year olds, the public has to understand that our sexual abusers of children
 are MALES -- and that they are heterosexual males.
             </p>
             <p>
              Heterosexual males are 100X more likely to sexually abuse a child than a homosexual male.
             </p>
             <p>
              A 1998 Study in the Journal of the American Medical Association found that 90% of pedophiles are men, and 95% of these individuals are heterosexual.
             </p>
             <p>
              Research has indicated that gay men and lesbians are less likely than heterosexual to sexually abuse children.
             </p>
             <p>
              Perhaps the most egregious and damaging claim promulgated by anti-gay groups is the claim that homosexuality is intrinsically linked to pedophilia and child sexual abuse.
             </p>
             <p>
              The social science research on sexual orientation and child sexual abuse clearly disproves the claim that homosexuals are more likely to molest children. A 1998 study in the Journal of the American Medical Association found that 90% of pedophiles are men, and 95% of these individuals are heterosexual. One researcher explained this statistic by noting, "Gay men desire consensual sexual relations with other adult men. Pedophiles are usually adult men who are sexually attracted to pre-pubescent children. They are rarely sexually attracted to other adults. In fact, research has indicated that gay men and lesbians are LESS likely than heterosexuals to sexually abuse children. Two studies that examined the sexual orientation of convicted child molesters found that less than 1% in one study and 0% in the other were lesbian or gay. One psychologist reviewed the existing social science literature on the relationship between sexuality and child sexual abuse and found that "a gay man is no more likely than a straight man to perpetrate sexual activity with children." Further, "cases of perpetration of sexual behavior with a pre-pubescent child by an adult lesbian are virtually nonexistent."

 Also : The right-wing "Family Research Council" notes/confirms findings that "almost all child sexual abuse is committed by men."

             Well said. I'd just like to add that nowadays, the most successful kidnappings are committed by couples or groups of people including at least one female. It's really terrifying. Be sure to warn your children and grand children to not trust female strangers either.

              True -- 
Other youths can also be used in kidnappings -- (Paul Bonacci acting for MKULTRA in the
Johnny Gosch kidnapping, for one), not only to allay the fears of the youngster being 
kidnapped but to aid in keeping the child under control in the getaway car.
             </p>
             <p>
              As I said, it is Males -- heterosexual males -- who are our sexual abusers of children.
However, women can be involved when they are under the influence of a heterosexual male.
             </p>
             <p>
              And, again, I'd stress education of the public.

              I've seen a number of cases where the mom or stepmom enabled the abuse so as to create child porn to sell online. I think we often underestimate the financial motive for these people.

             If nothing else, Brooklyn Heights would make a great setting for a spy novel: historic houses, cobbled streets, old tunnels, Hudson River, Brooklyn Bridge, lots of fog rolling in

           <p>
            Why would lots of fog be rolling in?  You are getting imaginative aren't you?  A lot of writers used to live there, so I'm sure it's in several books already. Brooklyn Heights is also the backdrop for many, many movies.  Because there are streets with old houses that still look like the 1920's, it's a favorite place to shoot period pieces.  You just have to bring in old time cars and get the costumes right.
           </p>
           <p>
            This street is used in movies all the time.  I think it was in JLO video recently.

It's much nicer looking that the ones they built for the new Second Ave Subway.   Apparently those subway grates that blew up Marilyn Monroe's skirt are no longer up to code.

           <p>
            As I mentioned that Atlantic Tunnel goes nowhere.   What piers are you talking about with the Pacific Street tunnel?
           </p>
           <p>
            Another problem for you tunnel theory is Brooklyn Heights is up on Heights.  Atlantic Ave is the border and that is probably sea level, but the subway tunnels in Brooklyn Heights are heading under the river just as the Heights rise up and thus the subways end up hundreds of feet below ground.

            I watched live, the interview where Podesta used the word 'subterranean'. That was a blatant admission of guilt.

            This is good article to let people know that Pizzagate isn't a conspiracy of a child sex ring run out of a pizza joints basement like the mainstream media likes to say. It's about the codewords that lead to pedogate which is world wide.

            The scariest part in your spy novel is not the rolling fog, it is John Podesta IN the rolling fog.  I believe it is all coincidental on purpose.  A Perfect Storm Operation.  There many of these that have been arranged all across the country.  I shudder to think how many children were brought through for her and her people and Skippy.  And what happened to them all.

            Nice article... everything in here has been discussed, but, the visibility and exposure this continues to get is great. If it makes people stop and think, that's more than the Mainstream Media has done in many decades.

            I wish Podesta would be questioned on the meaning of those emails... not enough popcorn in the world for that live stream. Of course, we know his response "I do not recall" x 100 would be the go to.

             You just said a mouth full, friend. This is everything. Am I right in saying all of /pizzagate would pay money, our actual money to see that. I'd empty my entire bank account. I'd sell shit. I'd do anything if someone, anyone would just sit that creepy fucker down and make him answer specific questions that NO ONE has asked him! ugh!
