<p>Let\'s make this a thread to summarize the evidence for the primary source of #pizzagate, within the United States, being the <strong>Central Intelligence Agency</strong>.</p>
<p>Five months ago, in October, I discovered FBIanon. I was just a normal Trump supporter who stumbled upon the FBIanon transcripts from 4chan. Reading those transcripts led me down five months of intensive investigation learning about the history of political conspiracy theories in the United States. I had never entertained a political conspiracy theory before in my life. When I read FBIanon write &quot;9/11 was Mossad,&quot; I laughed. Well, I don\'t laugh any more. </p>
<p>What\'s fascinating is that I noticed a common theme in all of the conspiracy theories. They all involved the CIA. Every <strong>single</strong> <strong>fucking</strong> <strong>time</strong>.</p>
<p>So let\'s make a list. I will update the post with more information as people bring it in.</p>
<ol>
<li>Comet Ping Pong is <a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1548634">allegedly located in an area of D.C. that is 80% CIA</a>.</li>
<li>James Alefantis\' <a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/comments/1665135">father is CIA</a>.</li>
<li>James Alefantis has a <a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1603142">museum with two names (Pegasus and Watchtower) that are the same as CIA drug operations from the 1980s</a>.</li>
<li>According to Pakistani intelligence, the NPH orphanage network in Haiti employs a CIA asset named <a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1625812">Mary Sue Conaway</a>.</li>
<li>VOAT researcher <a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1453400">suspects that Heavy Breathing music is based on MK-ULTRA programming</a>.</li>
<li>This one is debatable, but the combination of torture and colored-light over-stimulation also seems to be part of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7b273RhFHCY">MK-ULTRA brainwashing in the WorldCorp videos</a>.</li>
<li>Jeffrey Epstein, who calls himself the cofounder of the Clinton Foundation, and who is a convicted sex criminal and has settled dozens of lawsuits (citing hundreds of victims), is reported to operate <a href="http://www.zerohedge.com/news/2017-02-17/dhs-insider-warns-its-spy-versus-spy">a CIA/Mossad sex blackmail operation</a>. (See also <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Midnight_Climax">Operation Midnight Climax</a>, discussed further below.)</li>
<li>Hillary Clinton and Bill Clinton are both connected to the <a href="https://youtu.be/epXVDEn3gsQ">CIA through Mena Airport</a>.</li>
</ol>
<p>Three other famous Satanic/kidnapping rings were linked to the CIA:</p>
<ol>
<li>The <a href="http://www.franklincase.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=85&amp;Itemid=11">Franklin/Boys Town scandal is widely suspected of being linked to the CIA</a>. The scandal was linked <a href="http://www.voxfux.com/features/bush_child_sex_coverup/franklin.htm">to the White House</a> in The Washington Times in June of 1989, when CIA Ex-Director Bush Sr. was President, and the events took place when CIA Ex-Director Bush Sr. was Vice-President.</li>
<li><a href="https://youtu.be/NIbXbzK-XIA">The Finders Cult kidnapping investigation was shut down by the CIA</a>.</li>
<li>Michael Aquino, the famous Satanist from the Presidio SRA scandal, was a <a href="http://exposinginfragard.blogspot.com/2014/02/the-case-against-michael-aquino-satanic.html">CIA and military intelligence officer</a>.</li>
</ol>
<p>Of course, we already know that the CIA does evil things. For example, the following are undisputed, public knowledge, and listed on Wikipedia:</p>
<ol>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Paperclip">Operation Paperclip</a>: after World War 2, the government filled the intelligence services with thousands of top Nazis</li>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Sunrise_(World_War_II)">Operation Sunrise</a>: CIA Director Allen Dulles makes secret negotiations to help his Nazi friends at the end of WW2.</li>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_MKUltra">Operation MK-ULTRA</a>: the CIA tortured, brainwashed, and secretly drug-dosed countless innocent victims. Some victims became permanently mute, paralyzed, or incapacitated. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ff24-xGrSI">Learn about the worst of MK-ULTRA here.</a> The CIA destroyed about 95% of the documents, and we only have the fraction that we do, because of a mistake in destroying the documents.</li>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Midnight_Climax">Operation Midnight Climax</a>: An operation with MK-Ultra involved secretly dosing victims with LSD and filming them with prostitutes in sex blackmail operations.</li>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phoenix_Program">The Phoenix Program</a>: the CIA tortured and murdered countless innocent Vietnamese civilians and journalists in an attempt to undermine the North Vietnamese resistance.</li>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Mockingbird">Operation Mockingbird</a>: the CIA infiltrated the media (starting with CBS) and distorted or biased the reporting in favor of the CIA\'s agenda. Today, Anderson Cooper is a known &quot;ex&quot; CIA employee. MSNBC\'s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mika_Brzezinski">Mika Brzezinski</a>\'s father, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zbigniew_Brzezinski">Zbigniew</a>, was the National Security Advisor who hand delivered weapons to Al Queda in the CIA\'s Operation Cyclone.</li>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iran-contra">Iran-Contra</a>: the CIA violated Congress\'s Boland Amendment, which banned the CIA from funding the contras, by selling cocaine in the United States and by selling military arms to Iran.</li>
<li>The Dark Alliance investigation by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gary_Webb">Gary Webb</a>. Webb exposed much more information about the CIA selling cocaine in the Iran-Contra scandal. Webb was found in a &quot;suicide&quot; with two separate gunshots to his head.</li>
<li><a href="https://youtu.be/epXVDEn3gsQ">Mena Airport</a>: This is the famous airport in Arkansas where Barry Seal flew cocaine for the CIA. This is where Bill and Hillary Clinton got involved with the CIA, and were protected by the CIA. Notice that the CIA is really the only way to explain the giant trail of mysterious deaths and &quot;suicides&quot; in Clintons\' wake that never resulted in murder convictions (I encourage you to take the time to read through <a href="http://www.whatreallyhappened.com/RANCHO/POLITICS/DEAD/clinton-convenient-deaths21.jpg">the entire Clinton bodycount</a> - well over a hundred names).</li>
<li>Air America: The CIA <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_America_(airline)#Allegations_of_drug_smuggling">sold heroin out of Laos</a>.</li>
<li>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Church_Committee">Church Committee</a> also revealed other aspects of CIA corruption that are not necessarily included in the above list.</li>
</ol>
<p>In addition to these, I will add that the CIA is connected to other conspiracies:</p>
<ol>
<li>CIA assassin Ethan Hunt <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFAZ8DmcQLg">gave a deathbed confession to killing JFK</a>. Oswald also had <a href="http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/frontline/article/oswald-the-cia-and-mexico-city/">connections to the CIA</a>. This video provides an overview for the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NlJQJUUqR4">obvious CIA plot to kill JFK</a>. See also the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cb7kyEBypF8">book by Jerome Corsi</a>, the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4FVsS2sDkpE">book by Roger Stone</a>, the numerous books by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDaw35LPEvI">famous JFK researcher Mark Lane</a>, and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JFK_(film)">famous movie by Oliver Stone</a>.</li>
<li>Although 9/11 seems to be mostly a Mossad job, there must have been CIA and neoconservative complicity. For example, Osama bin Laden was our friend and a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allegations_of_CIA_assistance_to_Osama_bin_Laden">CIA/Mossad asset in the CIA Operation Cyclone war in Afganistan</a>. &quot;Al Queda&quot; <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al-Qaeda#Name">literally translates to &quot;the database&quot;</a> of CIA mujahideen in Afghanistan. Bin Laden\'s first reaction to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NPn-IdeN85s">9/11 was to deny his involvement</a>.</li>
<li>A recent federal court decision <a href="http://www.deseretnews.com/article/700020756/Ruling-reveals-CIA-involvement-in-Oklahoma-City-bombing-investigation.html">confirms that the CIA was involved in the Oklahoma City bombing investigation</a>. Numerous conspiracy theories <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oklahoma_City_bombing_conspiracy_theories#US_federal_government_involvement">link the CIA to the bombing</a>.</li>
<li>George Webb has a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/georgwebb">popular youtube series</a> outlining how the CIA, and its private sector cutout DynCorp, do nation topples, human trafficking, and organ harvesting around the world.</li>
</ol>
<p>The CIA was basically setup, after World War 2, and filled with Nazis, to perform black operations, under the cover of the law, to benefit U.S. corporate interests. The CIA has basically been selling heroin and cocaine, almost since the day it was created, to self-fund its black operations (first selling heroin out of Cuba). Attempted reforms, like the Church Committee and the Boland Amendment, were effectively ignored. Because the CIA operates under secrecy without meaningful discipline, and because people are too scared about the destabalizing effect of exposing its corruption (after JFK, 9/11, etc.), the CIA\'s corruption just grows like a cancer.</p>
<p>It\'s not a coincidence that Donald Trump\'s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GMBqDN7-QLg">first speech to a federal agency was at the CIA</a>. He knew from the first day that <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xV8V2RyAXA">9/11 involved controlled demolition</a>. He went right into the belly of the beast, but I\'m not sure that he knew the full danger. Roger Stone says that the only person in the CIA who likes Donald Trump is his choice for CIA Director, Mike Pompeo.</p>
<p>My dream is for Donald Trump to march the National Guard into the CIA offices at Langley and drain the swamp.</p>
<p>But perhaps nothing will happen. It\'s been one month and there are no real #pizzagate arrests. </p>

           The CIA was basically setup, after World War 2, and filled with Nazis, to perform black operations, under the cover of the law, to benefit U.S. corporate interests. The CIA has basically been selling heroin and cocaine, almost since the day it was created, to self-fund its black operations (first selling heroin out of Cuba). Attempted reforms, like the Church Committee and the Boland Amendment, were effectively ignored. Because the CIA operates under secrecy without meaningful discipline, and because people are too scared about the destabalizing effect of exposing its corruption (after JFK, 9/11, etc.), the CIA's corruption just grows like a cancer.

           It's not a coincidence that Donald Trump's
           <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GMBqDN7-QLg">
            first speech to a federal agency was at the CIA
           </a>
           . He knew from the first day that
           <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xV8V2RyAXA">
            9/11 involved controlled demolition
           </a>
           . He went right into the belly of the beast, but I'm not sure that he knew the full danger. Roger Stone says that the only person in the CIA who likes Donald Trump is his choice for CIA Director, Mike Pompeo.

            Can't forget about that CIA/Tavistock connection, either:
           </p>
           <p>
            In 1938, Roosevelt executed a secret agreement with Churchill which in effect ceded U.S. sovereignty to England, because it agreed to let Special Operations Executive control U.S. policies.
           </p>
           <p>
            To implement this agreement, Roosevelt sent General Donovan to London for indoctrination before setting up OSS (now the CIA) under the aegis of SOE-SIS. The entire OSS program, as well as the CIA has always worked on guidelines set up by the Tavistock Institute.
           </p>
           <p>
            Tavistock Institute originated the mass civilian bombing raids carried out by Roosevelt and Churchill purely as a clinical experiment in mass terror, keeping records of the results as they watched the "guinea pigs" reacting under "controlled laboratory conditions".
           </p>
           <p>
            All Tavistock and American foundation techniques have a single goal---to break down the psychological strength of the individual and render him helpless to oppose the dictators of the World Order. Any technique which helps to break down the family unit, and family inculcated principles of religion, honor, patriotism and sexual behavior, is used by the Tavistock scientists as weapons of crowd control.
           </p>
           <p>
            The methods of Freudian psychotherapy induce permanent mental illness in those who undergo this treatment by destabilizing their character. The victim is then advised to "establish new rituals of personal interaction", that is, to indulge in brief sexual encounters which actually set the participants adrift with no stable personal relationships in their lives, destroying their ability to establish or maintain a family.
           </p>
           <p>
            Tavistock Institute has developed such power in the U.S. that no one achieves prominence in any field unless he has been trained in behavioral science at Tavistock or one of its subsidiaries. Henry Kissinger, whose meteoric rise to power is otherwise inexplicable, was a German refugee and student of Sir John Rawlings-Reese at SHAEF.
           </p>
           <p>
            Dr. Peter Bourne, a Tavistock Institute psychologist, picked Jimmy Carter for President of the U.S. solely because Carter had undergone an intensive brainwashing program administered by Admiral Hyman Rickover at Annapolis.
           </p>
           <p>
            The "experiment" in compulsory racial integration in the U.S. was organized by Ronald Lippert, of the OSS and the American Jewish Congress, and director of child training at the Commission on Community Relations. The program was designed to break down the individual's sense of personal knowledge in his identity, his racial heritage.
           </p>
           <p>
            Through the Stanford Research Institute, Tavistock controls the National Education Association. The Institute of Social Research at the National Training Lab brain washes the leading executives of business and government. Such is the power of Tavistock that our entire space program was scrapped for nine years so that the Soviets could catch up.
           </p>
           <p>
            The hiatus was demanded in an article written by Dr. Anatol Rapport, and was promptly granted by the government, to the complete mystification of everyone connected with NASA. Another prominent Tavistock operation is the Wharton School of Finance, at the University of Pennsylvania.
           </p>
           <p>
            A single common denominator identifies the common Tavistock strategy---the use of drugs.
           </p>
           <p>
            The infamous MK Ultra program of the CIA, in which unsuspecting CIA officials were given LSD, and their reaction studied like "guinea pigs", resulted in several deaths. The U.S. Government had to pay millions in damages to the families of the victims, but the culprits were never indicted.

            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            As L. Marcus (1974) writes in his excellent investigation piece; “Reesian methods rely, completely and consciously, on the destruction of the mental life of world society and a forced march into universal sadism.”…. Within this lies their affinity- men as mindless beasts whose minds, according to Tavistock, are something to be manipulated and destroyed.
           </p>
           <p>
            …. The Tavistock- and Reesian method- that the class war should be waged with “weapons that affect morale more than they take life”- has become, in the post-war period, the primary weapon system of the Rockefeller forces, including their own covert arm, the Central Intelligence Agency.
           </p>
           <p>
            The CIA apparatus has penetrated every key organization, including think tanks, universities, non-governmental organizations and Foundations. For example, most major universities are either entirely or substantially branches of the CIA…. Through control of governmental and major foundations, the CIA has been able to have a say “not only in what programs are funded, but to control the selection of instructors who move into controlling positions” as honest academicians are weeded out and hounded into retirement.
           </p>
           <p>
            …. The situation is extremely grave. We are fighting a combined effort of some of the most brilliant people in history who scheme against us for the purposes of possessing us. But the human will is immortal. Tyrants have killed millions and yet people fought and eventually won their freedom…. Immortality has its moral basis in truth and incorruptibility. It deserves to be given all the support that it can get. It deserves to be fought and died for.
Daniel Estulin: “Tavistock: Social Engineering the Masses” (2015)
           </p>
           <p>
            "Three elements combine to make the Institute unusual, if not unique: it has the independence of being entirely self-financing, with no subsidies from the government or other sources; the action research orientation places it between, but not in, the worlds of academia and consultancy; and its range of disciplines include anthropology, economics, organisational behaviour, political science, psychoanalysis, psychology and sociology.
           </p>
           <p>
            So reads the opening paragraphs of the Tavistock Institute home page at www.tavinstitute.org
           </p>
           <p>
            The ideology of American foundations was created by the Tavistock Institute of Human Relations in London. In 1921, the Duke of Bedford, Marquess of Tavistock, the 11th Duke, gave a building to the Institute to study the effect of shellshock on British soldiers who survived World War I. Its purpose was to establish the “breaking point” of men under stress, under the direction of the British Army Bureau of Psychological Warfare, commanded by Sir John Rawlings-Reese.
           </p>
           <p>
            Tavistock Institute is headquartered in London. Its prophet, Sigmond Freud, settled in Maresfield Gardens when he moved to England. He was given a mansion by Princess Bonaparte. Tavistock’s pioneer work in behavioral science along Freudian lines of “controlling” humans established it as the world center of foundation ideology. Its network now extends from the University of Sussex to the U.S. through the Stanford Research Institute, Esalen, MIT, Hudson Institute, Heritage Foundation, Center of Strategic and International Studies at Georgetown, where State Dept. personal are trained, US Air Force Intelligence, and the Rand and Mitre corporations."

              subreddit days, haha. I obsessively researched this shit until right before Xmas, and TStk was my "special interest". But my effing god. Deep delving into this shit fucks w your head no matter what, but once you go really deep into the tstk connection... It will damn near ruin you.

              I am incredibly sensitive/empathetic (an empath l, if you believe in that shit) ... And I just woke up one day and couldn't even bring myself to even read anything about this shit on here or FB or anywhere else.

              Everything goes back to Britain, yes. Crowley plays a part in this but he is more of a side show act. Yes, lots of people base their crazy shit off of his beliefs, but I feel like he is too well known by the public- and too modern, if I remember correctly (he was born/practiced in the 20th century, correct?) .

             Yeah. I'm fairly confident that the CIA controls most all of the cocaine and the heroin trafficking in the U.S.

            I agree with turitelle's comment.  These inhumans are depraved and one aspect of that is the need to inflict trauma on innocents.  We all (those of us old enough to have been watching) watched what we watched, live, and it traumatized us much more than an unattended collapse ever could have.

            Interesting White House concept, but it would not have had the same impact as thousands of people dying right before our eyes did.

Especially that the CIA is EVIL.  :(

            They didn't mess it up, they wanted their wars and without how they did 911 they had no justification.  They did it that way deliberately, they wanted to traumatize the nation, and indeed the world and gain consensus to invade Afghanistan and Iraq. Neither of which had anything to do with 911 but they didn't care about that anymore than they cared about the thousands who died in the buildings or the hundreds of thousands that died in their bombing.

            You've definitely mentioned the connections with the CIA and drugs, but here is Pablo Escobar's son claiming that his father worked with the agency to fight against the rise of the reds in Central America.

             Thank you for sharing this.  This is an important data point. I believe that the CIA controls almost all cocaine and heroin trafficking in the United States.

              No sweat. We're a team and I'm thrilled to be able to contribute. I've got this thread bookmarked, I'll be popping back in and out as I think of or discover other relevant facts. I think I was also thinking is it'd be helpful if the list could be updated as new information is discussed or otherwise comes to light.

            CIA is the largest terrorist organization on the planet.  They are in its self their own government. The Pentagon comes in 2nd.  I guess its true. The love of money is the root of all evil. And im not even a Christian either. But the saying still stands true.

            Actually, not to be a debbie downer, but it wouldn't. Intelligence agencies like the CIA and Mossad only exist because people believe in the myth of authority - the idea that certain people are fit to rule over others. Mossad, CIA, government corruption are all just symptoms of something deeper. More intelligence agencies would pop up after CIA/Mossad because the masses of people still buy into the notion of authority. I have been researching what you would call 'conspiracy theories' for 6/7 years now but most of the research only focuses on the symptoms. Please research the likes of Mark Passio and read Larken Rose's book, the most dangerous superstition, to get a firmer grasp on why (the most important question is always the why) all of this evil exists in the first place. Unfortunately, nothing will change (and Trump will not really change a god damn thing in the long run) as long as people still want to be ruled over by governments and politicians. Here is a free pdf to the most dangerous superstition:

             I'm familiar with both authors and their material is worthwhile.  I disagree about Trump to this extent: if he does kick open the Pizzagate hellmaw, some things will change.  Nobody can see that and go on as though everything is the same.  It will inevitably spark some kind of change; the question is where will that process ultimately take us?  I don't have any idea, but I'm not willing to do nothing when we have a chance to roll the dice.

            Pop quiz: what do the shootings at San Bernadino, Fort Lauderdale, Fort Hood and Orlando Pulse have in common? At each incident, a former employee of DynCorp was a victim. What a coincidence!

            According to George Webb, Waco was also a CIA operation. David Koresh was protecting kids being trafficked by the CIA through the local airport.

              I have watched a lot of GW's great web series..I was surprised to learn today as I listened to the George Webb interview on Veritas Radio that George is an Israeli citizen. At about 10 minutes in, when host Mel Fabregas suggests Mossad may have a role in trying to take Trump down, George laughs,"Me being Israeli, I am proud of Mossad, considering what a small country we are..."

              This may suggest a possible source of bias in his work.

               George Webb has told me that he struggles with 9/11.
              </p>
              <p>
               I'm a little torn. On the one hand, heart disease and cancer and car accidents kill far more people that 9/11 ever will. On the other hand, 9/11 strikes me as about the evil thing someone can do. Just watch the people jumping from the towers as nano-thermite cooks them alive.
              </p>

               The thing about George is that he's 100x times more knowledgeable than me. And I'm a pretty smart guy. George is constantly citing names and connections about things that I don't even know about. I learn so much from him (80% of my original post is based on stuff I learned from George). So, yeah, he has his biases, but overall his work has been helpful. I hope he acknowledges the truth about 9/11.

                No doubt he is a genius, a great communicator, and a likeable guy. But, I am wondering now if he may be a Mossad agent, as well. Has he ever once mentioned the Israelis who are involved in organ harvesting?

             I don't really know. The FBIanon who posted on the "Liberty Veritas" (spelling website) sounded like the same person to me. He predicted the 30 arrests, following for 40 more arrests. That prediction didn't come true.

             The DHS insider sounds very similar too:

             It's probably obvious to you, but I thought it was helpful to a lot of newbies to put all of the pieces together.
            </p>
            <p>
             People think that there are all of these different conspiracies, and they can't all be true.
            </p>
            <p>
             But there aren't a ton of different, disconnected conspiracy theories. In the United States, there is really just one major one, and that is that the CIA is evil. If you understand that, it explains everything else - especially in the realm of kidnapping, Satanic ritual abuse, and #pizzagate.

            Exactly right. The WP has a $600 million CIA contrast (Bezos only spent $250 million to buy the WP!). The funny thing is that it is helping the Washington Post lose all credibility.

            There needs to be a deadline set. If say by August 1st 2017...all of the criminal members of the CIA are not arrested...we as citizens need to march on Langley, VA and bulldoze down the walls and preform citizens arrests, confiscate their computers and send to WikiLeaks

             Can you imagine Trump giving a speech:
            </p>
            <p>
             "Ladies and gentlemen, it is time to exercise our Second Amendment rights to bear arms and form militias. I am calling on the Joint Chiefs of Staff, the military, and the American people to support me as we march on the CIA Headquarters, tomorrow at noon. If I should die in some mysterious or suspicious manner, I call on the American people to rise up and drain the swamp. I am the President of the United States and I have reason to believe that the CIA is fundamentally corrupt, that it was involved in killing President JFK, that it knew about 9/11 and let it happen, and that the U.S. government has been hijacked and compromised ever since JFK was assassinated. Stand with me now as we drain the swamp, and God bless the United States of America."

              The CIA works closely with mossad for jewish interests. It has always been loaded with jews. It would make no sense to hire national socialists to work for jewish interests. It doesn't take much thinking to figure out why that wouldn't work.

            Great Post! Makes me very glad to see this. I've grown old with this information on my back [tears]
           </p>
           <p>
            Comment on the "Mossad" 9/11 connections:
           </p>
           <p>
            The "Mossad" is a scape - goat which plays into the "Jews Did It" / which is a longstanding psy-op
           </p>
           <p>
            It was outsourced to the Mossad, likely because the  Mossad are outstanding with "what they do," they would have their heart in it [protect Israel] unlike Americans, and for legal reasons it would be definitely be prudent not to break U.S. laws and to do it under the rubric of "liaison" with another country's intelligence services.
           </p>
           <p>
            I listened recently to Webb's elucidation on the legal loop-hole of hiring a detachment / partnering with non U.S. government players. 
It may have been on the Richie Allen interview? -

             https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gXh0FqB3uc8
            </a>
            -
Much is summarized there.
           </p>
           <p>
            Anyway, people feel better thinking it was "The Jews" who did it. - feeds into "Jews Killed Our Jesus" and all that, for Christians.
           </p>
           <p>
            But the top perps were the Mass Media , the New Cons. and our own American - grown Think Tanks .. MITRE.
           </p>
           <p>
            No way a tiny country, created for the very purpose of fomenting war and conquest, could've come in and done it to us. But that's a good diversion, for everyone to think it was Israel itself.. As Webb pointed out in the interview above.. It's an International Octopus.
           </p>
           <p>
            We've done work on it . And we have names; beside just "Israel" It's more detailed.
           </p>
           <p>
            They all look very happy and "white collar" too; when you find images of their faces.. Also like nerds, some of them.

             I respectfully disagree. Mossad agents had been making comments about an Arab flying a plane into the tallest building in NYC for decades. There was a movie where a plane flies into the Pan Am building. There was a television show in 2001, before 9/11, about drone airplanes flying into the World Trade Center. All of these have Israeli connections.
            </p>
            <p>
             I'm not anti-Israel or an anti-Semite. But the evidence is overwhelming that Mossad was the primary architect of 9/11. Watch some Christopher Bollyn videos on youtube or read his book Solving 9/11. It's not a coincidence that 9/11 happened right after the neoconservative (heavily Israeli) came into power in the U.S. government.
            </p>
            <p>
             Of course, I agree with you that the U.S. government was complicit, let it happen, and maybe even requested it. Cheney and Rumsfield both seem to have orchestrated drill operations on 9/11 that confused our air defenses. But it was mostly Mossad. Just google Larry Silverstein, dancing Israelis, Mossad DEA report, Project Gelatin, the B thing, Mossad in Hollywood, etc.

              Second part is this: Americans has a strong emotional predispostion to deny what really happened 9/11. It softens the blow if they are told "Israel Did It" which is on it's face absurd. And plays upon the prejudices of a large portion of the Conspiracy Crowd going back hundreds of years. People are convinced it was "Israel" because it's emotionaly difficult to admit it had to be our own government - traitors within; and the Mass Media..
             </p>
             <p>
              When you realize the Plane Hoax you will understand why researchers know that. It was a very large conspiracy. In fact it's right in everyone's face; if they would but look. However, they are too afraid of what they will see and too desirous for the real truth ,to be their fantasy instead, that they will not look nor admit.

               I never said that the U.S. government wasn't involved or that it wasn't a massive conspiracy involving many globalist players.

               You, samhara, have a bizarre emotional connection to defending Mossad and Israel. It's ok if you don't agree with Christopher Bollyn. We don't have to agree on everything. Let's not relitigate the past over and over here. Mossad was one tiny part of my original post at the top. And that post shows, in data point after data point, that the CIA is evil and corrupt. Yet I mention Mossad one or two times, and that's what you want to fight about. Get over it.

            There's another very troubling aspect to the extent of the CIA's reach: how many technology executives are undercover CIA assets. George Webb in his video series has claimed that Eric Schmidt, CEO of Google's parent company is a CIA asset and that Bill Gates is too. He said Steve Jobs refused which is why he suddenly developed cancer.
           </p>
           <p>
            I haven't had the time to pursue this but it would probably be a very fruitful line of inquiry.

             Yes. I completely agree. The CIA has its tentacles into Silicon Valley (why do you think it hates Trump?).

            <p>
             Once you realize that the CIA will fund and corrupt private businesses, you stop thinking that we have a free market. You start to wonder if Google and facebook succeeded, and became monopolies, because of that CIA black budget money. Facebook was funded by Peter Thiel. Peter Thiel does Palantir.

            Thx for the insight. What you say makes a lot of sense. So if that's their process for creating chaos, how the heck do we short circuit this American Spring they keep talking about more every day?

             I didn't know it was that bad either. I don't think anybody did. I watched the first three seasons of Homeland. I thought the CIA was badass.

             Now I realize that it's just like the Mafia. It's just like The Godfather. But it's legal, and it's secret, and nobody gives a fuck. All of this information is on Wikipedia.

            CIA is also affiliated with the Jesuit Order and the Roman Catholic Church. This video explains a whole lot on the subject and much more. Epic MUST WATCH:

             I will check it out. Thank you. Yes, I believe that a lot of these corrupt secret societies are linked together. It's just that the CIA connection is big and obvious.

            There was a AIC Annex 1 mile from Benghazi with 15-25 very well trained and armed AIC "Hush Team" agents. Also, 2 SEAL teams were told to stand down. Why? Because Ambassador Stevens was going to leak what he was already being vocal about. (Child/Human/Organ Trafficking, Drug Trafficking, Arms Trafficking through the AIC)

             Watch the movie 13 Hours and then realize that all of that happened because HRC ignored 600 requests for security.

            In defense of CIA (Oh, did I really write this?????) :
           </p>
           <p>
            Does anyone know what Secret and Intelligence services do all over the world?
           </p>
           <p>
            Does anyone remember the aftermath of 2d world war and the egemonic threat of USSR?
           </p>
           <p>
            Does anyone remember Cold War and the power of USSR influence in the West? That was evil too!
           </p>
           <p>
            Not an excuse but that's when the CIA gained power and back then they were not totally moraly condemnable. That also explains the use of former "Nazis" (about everyone could be called a "nazi" in NSADP governed Germany until 1945) . There's nothing surprising. Every state does this kind of stuff at some level. Now, what happened since the 1980's matches more with the discussions here, but if you ignore the past you leave the realm of reason and put your sane moral rejection in the hands of irrational forces (besides allowing yourself to be manipulated by competitive forces).

             You make a good point, but it is much worse than you suggest.
            </p>

             Eisenhower definitely believed that black ops were better than boots on the ground, and he let Allen Dulles do whatever he wanted.
            </p>

             That doesn't mean that the CIA isn't evil. It is. And it's evil goes back long before the 1980s. The CIA was selling heroin out of Cuba to self-fund almost since day 1. That's a blatant violation of the law and a violation of Congress. Then the CIA killed JFK. Of course, they told themselves that JFK was a threat to the United States, and that they knew better than JFK what was good for the country. But really they just wanted to take out the guy who was hurting their corporate profits and trying to drain the swamp. The CIA has been evil ever since.

              I don't disagree. That's why I couldn't believe to find myself in a position to "defend" them. Just that the fight against commies in the 50's to 80's was a tough one and quite justified in the end.  Guess they went really mad after the fall of the Soviet Union.
             </p>

              In France the power of the stalinist-communist party post-war could really push many into a blind pro-American stand that turned as well to be pro-CIA.

              Intelligence services everywhere are playing ugly games and don't always measure the consequences. Think of the Dreyfus case... (Officer in military intelligence, lot to do with homo blackmail)

                You've got a lot on your plate to say the least :)  But I do think you would very much profit, and enjoy, this interview. It's long  though ... but one of the most priceless things on the web, as far as I'm concerned. But I'm a real Kennedy assassination buff, and know some of the older people that were involved. Good luck, stay sane!

                  Yes. This confession will connect some dots between CIA (for example David Atlee Phillips) and the mafia.

                  Don't forget eventually to check out the ARRB with Douglas Horne and his masterpiece four volume work on the assassination (mainly the illicit Bethesda autopsy). Below is one link but he's all over youtube too.

                  I 'speak' from time to time with Oswald's ex-mistress (she was w/ him in New Orleans back in the day). There's just so so much, just w/ JFK alone. (That was when they really started flexing their muscle.)
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  And check out the book Mary's Mosaic: The CIA Conspiracy to Murder John F. Kennedy, Mary Pinchot Meyer, and Their Vision for World Peace.

                  And it just goes on and on. Remember to get your sleep, as that's when the brain organizes everything you delved into the previous day :)

             The CIA is involved with various cults. The CIA especially loves to use them to turn them against CIA targets. Many of them have CIA initials: Catholics in Action, Christians in Action. There are thousands of them. Branch Davidians, etc.

                Thank you for the links, I'm reading the Alex Constantine one now. I'm not sure I trust Peter Levenda's motives though after reading this

                Also, Levenda was pictured with John Podesta.

            The local newspaper is absolutely corrupt, and censors and bans users who post the truth about Racine. Voat has been fairly reliable, but most other sources are heavily censored, and no media outlet will touch it. It is a huge story, and what is happening there would blow the doors wide open on pizzagate and global corruption. Witnesses have been gang stalked, retaliated against and threatened, and others are waiting to come forward when they know they can be safe and protected.
           </p>
           <p>
            It is relatively easy to begin putting some of the bigger pieces of the puzzle together if you look into a few headline cases from Racine, and there is more information on voat, some blog sites and there were some other sites that were all taken down, one was called Racine Exposed and there are a few others. It is much more sinister in reality - gruesome murders, underground tunnels, human and drug trafficking, extreme corruption, and collusion to ruin people's lives and worse. The connections with child trafficking, high levels within secret societies, sacred history, control of water, and sustainability are the key, but the easy way to break it open is through criminal corruption. It is the birthplace of community policing, and was an early adopter of asset forfeiture, militarization and surveillance equipment.
           </p>
           <p>
            There was a recent RICO suit settled under threat and duress that was a small tip of the iceberg. It runs extremely deep, way beyond Racine to all parts of the globe. One main concern is that the feds have known more than enough to begin indictments, but are incredibly slow and are more interested in covering it up and finding a few fall guys than to uncover the real truth and massive levels of corruption.  Racine is being connected and compared to another city under FBI investigation - Allentown, Pennsylvania, but what is going on in Racine is much worse and runs much deeper than a few corrupt politicians. The secrets of Racine will reveal why Paul Ryan is so powerful. What if the world suddenly knew the real truth?

            Still thinking about it and hearing George's words in my head. Another sin to add to the master list: Conspiring to whack a sitting Ambassador.
           </p>
           <p>
            His name was Christopher Stevens and he was a goddamn patriot! Murdered after he intercepted  emails that detailed the plan to eliminate khaddafi, take his wealth and transfer his rather large stockpile of chemical weapons to ISIS in Syria. To be used at a later time to signal a false flag attack which was made to look like the Assad gov't. He questioned them and said hey, wait, what? Syrin gas going to ISIS in Syria, that's surely gotta be a mistake? So he was eliminated or silenced for knowing to much and trying to ask the tough questions, meanwhile, they get the money/gold/weapons and also create the vacuum of power and terrorist safe haven that exists in Libya to this day.

             Obviously Stevens was murdered. It's not clear exactly what he knew, and when. But the domestic FBI seems to know what happened, and hopefully we will see the truth.

             I think Donald Trump is waiting a long time because there are a lot of things that he wants to accomplish first, before dealing with the whole scandal of HRC and the Clinton Foundation.

              I believe there are other reasons as well why that hasn't been priority alpha. And that's public perception. They've chosen to start at the bottom and work their way towards the top it seems. And it's actually a smart play. Go too hard, too fast and there will be perfect storm for the libs to say, "hey, this is political persecution and the charges are a farce". With these high level ops, the timing has to be just right, and the people have to at least be ready for such disclosures, if not calling for indictments/charges outright. But I'm with Seaman when he says, "fair trials, public executions upon guilty verdicts. Let them hang".

            This is a very good post. I would rate it an A plus. But I disagree with you on one thing. I believe that Trump did know he was being used. I think he made this his advantage. Both parties, the intelligence agencies and the media are all so disconnected from regular people that they could not see it unfolding. I think Trump did see it.

             I have to guess, but I think he is second generation. I think he was brought up inside of a CIA culture of brainwashing and Satanism. He believes a lot of the occult things, even if his parents and handlers didn't believe them. He wasn't smart enough to get a big position in the State Department, CIA, or US Aid. He became a center figure for child trafficking, and he did that from his pizza restaurant front operation. Then he posted way too much to Instagram, and he is about to be cut loose to Jeff Sessions and Donald Trump.

               Exactly, CIA/Mossad. And all of these rings are connected. British Intelligence started it all after WW1, creating Israel for the Rothschilds. Alister Crowley was a suspected British spy.

              A good, educated guess...But I have to wonder; is it really that simple and obvious? What if there is more? I don't know I just sometimes feel like we are missing something. Something that is staring at us in the face. But what it is I don'
t know.

               The more complicated part is: who controls the CIA? Candidates include: far-right revanchist elements in the Israeli Likud party, Wall Street, the Rothschilds banking dynasty, Henry Kissinger, George Soros, and top level free masons (or something we don't even know about). I don't know the truth at the highest level, so I leave it out for now. You can learn a lot simply by adsorbing the truth that the CIA is evil.

                As far as JA is concerned, there may be some Secret Societies protection/involvement. He seems very drawn the the occult as you mentioned earlier. This may hold true for others at higher levels of CIA as well. Some of these societies have been around for hundreds , even thousands of years. They often morph and infiltrate in order to survive. One needs to contemplate the power of something centuries old that has seen Empires rise and fall.

                 Yes I agree that there is lots of occult involvement. It's not clear to me what it is, how many different cults there are, and what their relationships are. There is lots of evidence from Wikileaks (Moloch, Minerva, 322, Thelema, Rothschild). But I don't know the big picture on the occult stuff. The CIA corruption is obvious.

                  I keep pondering on the occult point because strange as this will sound to those not openly in tune to certain forces; I have been psychically attacked to some degree ever since getting involved in pizzagate. I think there is an esoteric component that is being largely ignored. It matters not to me how fantastical this sounds. Those in the know will fully understand the meaning of this.

                    Physical? As in have you been threatened? Please describe? In my case, so far, it has been astral. Mainly during my sleep.

                     Perhaps it can be written off as coincidence but while on her phone, and as my wife was being red pilled about the satanic nature of this ritualistic occult abuse the metal lamp above her literally began raining down sparks upon her.  She kept screaming my name and shouting 'oh my goodness'.  I finally ran down stairs and unplugged the lamp.  The sparks had burned holes into the chair she was sitting on. Thankfully she was not injured. 
 Although the sparks were caused by a short circuit in the lamp within the switch where the insulation on the wires wore away over time and began to arc on the metal part of the lamp - as a Christian, I attribute this to demonic activity rather than mere coincidence. I believe what is occrung in the physical world is a manifestation of the battle against what Paul calls, 'The darkness and rulers/authorities if the air'... Finally, real life national and world events discussed on this board, as well as the larger conspiracy which uses pizza/predicate as a tool, matches up with what is described in the book of Revelations according to most studies/interpretations: i.e. One world government/religion. Sadly demonic activity is real, but thankfully God has the ultimate victory, and this is cause for hope in such darkness. 'The gates of Hell shall not prevail against me Church'

                  They don't call them Secret Societies for nothing. If you've not already done so look into Crowley and Montauk Project and The Philadelphia experiment. Heady stuff. Stranger than fiction.

            I've also heard George Webb refer to that pattern as OTPOR. Popovich or something like that. I've seen the disrupt phase for at least a year now. If nothing is done about filth in the govt and elite the protests WILL grow larger, won't have to pay me.

            Just spending a lot of time at moment reviewing researcher/investigator Mae Brussel, who was brilliant.
This section - "Why Is the Senate Watergate Committee Functioning As Part of the Cover-Up?
            <a href="http://maebrussell.com/Mae%20Brussell%20Articles/Why%20Is%20The%20Senate%20Watergate%20Committee%20Functioning%20As%20Part%20of%20the%20Coverup%201.html">

            covers a lot of ground and pretty much 100% of it involves the CIA/Gestapo control over it all.
It's 3 parts -- but very much worth a quick look.
Notice this --
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             Warfare industries were in trouble without a Nixon-Agnew victory. The war in Asia could escalate after elections. The Middle East is waiting for their U.S.-fomented war next. A Democratic president might change the course of U.S. economic dependence on warfare hardware into domestic needs. There is less profit in building the U.S. than in bombing Cambodia or importing and distributing narcotics with CIA transportation.
             <strong>
              The drug traffic from Asia involves more billions than military profits
             </strong>
             .&gt;

           </blockquote>
           <p>
            Drugs and drug trafficking are very much a part of pizzagate and MKULTRA where victims who have been tortured, sexually abused to create multiple personalities are often programmed as homosexual prostitutes, drug runners, and trained for espionage/spies.  Some are programmed for photographic memories.
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_MKUltra">
             https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_MKUltra
            </a>
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             MKUltra used numerous methodologies to manipulate people's mental states and alter brain functions, including the surreptitious administration of drugs (especially LSD) and other chemicals, hypnosis,[10] sensory deprivation, isolation, verbal and sexual abuse, as well as other forms of psychological torture.[11][  &gt;
            </p>
           </blockquote>
           <p>
            Purpose of the program was for Mind Control.

            Great work, Party. I agree. Virtually all the worst ills of the past 60-odd years can be laid squarely on the doorstep of the CIA. The organization should be dissolved. They never served the people of the US, only Wall Street.

            Also, be sure and watch this 10 minute video of former Minnesota Governor Jesse Ventura telling about the CIA implanted in State government and how they interrogated him:

            Is there anyone out there capable of getting this stuff into different languages? I'm totally unqualified for it but there are lots of intelligent resourceful people here so is anyone up to the task? We finally have a chance to prove to the whole fucking world what they've done.. I liked an earlier comment I read that suggested a second renaissance would be a result of ousting these sickos and I think that's exactly what would happen.

               I have several friend, and my sister is a DJ, extremely tech savy, we are in Australia - and pizzagate is spreading around fast. Also my step dad is expert in Russian editing, and workef in the media, possesses amazing russian, together with my sister we can do a great job. I will talk to her to make a text and a video for the Russian viewers. Russians cannot stand Hillary Clinton but have no idea about what she is into.

           <pre><code>The intelligence community of this Nation, which requires a shroud
of secrecy in order to operate, has a very sacred trust from the
American people. The CIA's program of human experimentation of
the fifties and sixties violated that trust. It was violated again on the
day the bulk of the agency's records were destroyed in 1973. It is
violated each time a responsible official refuses to recollect the details
of the program. The best safeguard against abuses in the future is a
complete public accounting of the abuses of the past.
I think this is illustrated, as Chairman Inouye pointed out. These
are issues, are questions that happened in the fifties and sixties, and
go back some 15, 20 years ago, but they are front page news today, as
we see in the major newspapers and on the television and in the media
of this country; and the reason they are, I think, is because it just continuously
begins to trickle out. sort of, month after month, and the
best way to put this period behind us, obviously, is to have the full
information, and I think that is the desire of Admiral Turner and of
the members of this committee.

                You are very good, I won't speculate about your background but your CIA summary is top notch stuff. I thought COINTEl-PRO was CIA operation, that's what I have read in all the books? Drug money from Sandinistas arming Iran Contras - October Surprise? When drugs are involved CIA rears its ugly head?

                 COINTEL-PRO was FBI under the corrupt Hoover administration.
                </p>
                <p>
                 I don't know for sure, but I read that the general FBI is actually pretty good now. It's the CIA that is evil. CIA has infiltrated FBI through JTTF.
                </p>
                <p>
                 Everyone, around the world, can learn a lot just by reading FBIanon's transcripts, and then rereading them and rereading them. I've read them dozens of times.
                </p>
                <p>
                 Listen, I'm a smart man, in terms of my grades and my pedigree and my career. But it only took me five months to crack this case. If I can do it, other people can do it too. All you have to do is read Wikipedia, watch youtube, and not assume that CNN and the NYT are telling the truth.
                </p>
                <p>
                 There are many, many people who came before me and know 100x more than I do. Mark Lane is dead now. He died in 2016. He died telling the world, in bestselling books, that the CIA did JFK. He told us, and he sold millions of books, and nothing happened. We need to spread the message that the CIA is evil.

              It's a good quote and document to show people who are in denial of the CIA wrongdoings. Normies think MKULTRA is a wackjob conspiracy, but when they see official hearings regarding the program, they quickly convert. It's like a taste of the red pill.

            I urge that ANYONE looking into MK ULTRA is to actually took at all remaining
            <a href="http://www.theblackvault.com/documentarchive/cia-mkultra-collection/#">
             documents
            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            Keep in mind that most of the archives were destroyed when the program ended in 1979 / It is speculated because due to people admitting that the their human subjects were off the record/illegals/homeless and were used for their more extreme tests, those documents were their only remaining proof. This may include methods that may be used against the CIA's interest.
           </p>
           <p>
            What remains is what they kept on file outlining the program, still a lot of really useful info on how they operated, this info was released under FOIA.
           </p>

             The program never really ended. But people need to look at the documents.

             I suspect that the MK-Ultra brainwashing Satanism actually goes back to Alister Crowley and MI6 Satanism.

              I agree i think its worse, At that time they had full government resource , and with LSD and the notable effect on western culture, along with the threat of communism, it had a lot of backing by those in congress. It wasn't until things were uncovered by the public that they had to disband.
             </p>
             <p>
              Why I say it's worse as that research could of been continued under the funding of private investors, particularly ones invested in totalitarianism, like why do mega corporations seem to always have a cult following, regardless of peoples opinions or their reputation? Boycotting never seems to work anymore.
             </p>

              Occultism is totalitarianism at its finest, It's the fabric of conformity, regardless of what religion, It seems that satanism is the religion of the elite, set by their puppet masters so that they will conform to them through blackmail or maintaining their status.

            I really don't have a problem with Trump closing the CIA, and firing every single one of those assholes.   Lots of good people would lose their jobs too, but sacrifices must be made.    I doubt the country would suffer greatly with the loss.

            Anonymous guy claiming to be FBI. That's gotta be my favorite Pizzagate character. I wonder which actor will play him in "Pizzagate-The Movie".?
           </p>
           <p>
            Seriously though, I wonder why those tabloids at the grocery checkout don't have special Pizzagate editions. They'd sell millions! Or some enterprising Pizzagater could print up an original pizzagate tabloid and sell them to all the stores. Photos of Abramovich holding the goat horns on the cover will sell a million. Splash headlines about cannibalism, harvesting organs from children, damn there I go again giving away a billion dollar idea. You mix in enough real and important things, like DC pedo culture and arrests, then they can't even call you out on it.
           </p>
           <p>
            Probably get twenty editions out of it before it dries up.

             Can you explain how FBIanon predicted #pizzagate on July 2, four months before the Podesta emails were released, and four months before #pizzagate was talked about in the New York Times and Washington Post? Please let me know what your explanation is.

               Good guys in the FBI. It's not a coincidence that a former retired FBI assistant director surprised CNN with this:

            Seriously great list, mate... My only regret is I have but one upvoat to give. I added a couple of my thoughts to it in the comments and now that I know it's a fluid list, I'll be thinking about this and keeping an eye out for relevant materials to add to it. I especially like how you mentioned dyncorp, but you might also want to mention how some employees were busted with a 15 year old boy at an inappropriate company party, which was specifically mentioned in the #podestathamolesta's emails in the wikileaks dumps.

"Lolita island" was a place where this happened, among other locations that were completely pre-wired up to get dirt on those people. Mossad was running the op and Epstein was a key cog in the wheel.

              Not only our gov't.. Many gov'ts around the world. Blackmail can be an extremely useful tool for the opposition. Most notably, two of the largest foreign gov'ts to contribute to the ultra-corrupt Clinton Foundation. Iceland and Norway, that contributed $125 mil and just over $80 mil respectively, in 2016. I mean that's a lot of cheese for these small countries. Why do you think that is? Then she spends a ridiculous amount of money on the campaign and we all know how that turned out. But shortly thereafter, the "donations" dried up quick. Suspicious. Not sure about you, but that doesn't pass the sniff test to me.

               Yes, exactly. I didn't know about Iceland. But it's not a coincidence that a Satanic child abuse ring was captured and arrested right after the CF left Norway.

               I tell people that any donor to the CF is guilty as fuck (like the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation), and people don't believe me.

                Also Haiti, when the ring got busted there, the CF knew they were burnt so they exited stage left. Another donor to really take a good look at is the billionaire Frank Giustra. That guy is dirty sure as the day is long. Guy just looks like a little worm. Here's a photo, guess what he's doing? Cooking a pizza in a brickoven. Pic related.

                 Giustra is a total creep. Anyone who watched George Webb knows that. He has a pizza restaurant (222 Pizza Express) and an FBI pedo logo in his business.

                  He also is the founder of his own dirty op called, "The Radcliffe Foundation", and he's most notably known as the founder of "Lionsgate" film company, which has produced several big time productions.  I'm suspect he uses his foundation to launder his money, just like everyone else.

                   Yes. George Webb has gone over all of this. See the movies Repo: The Genetic Opera (organ harvesting), Hostel 1 and 2 (torture, sadism, trafficking), and Sicario (CIA drug trafficking).

            This is the best post for a while and proves that voat is legit. CIA is the main tentacle of the Octopus. Remember JFK's words regarding CIA 'I intend to break it into thousand litte pieces and scatter remains in the wind.'

             Exactly. It's so obvious once you start looking at it with an open mind. All of the evidence is just waiting for you. Just ignore the mainstream media and CNN for 30 minutes and the truth pops right out.

             I agree with FBIanon that Saudi Arabia and Mossad have infiltrated huge swaths of the federal government, with obvious targets (McCain, Graham, Abedin, etc.).

              'Taken' must be the ugliest example. The good CIA operative's daughter is kidnapped by evil Albanian traffickers and so he moves heaven and earth to rescue her. Meanwhile it's the good CIA operatives acting on their master's orders (Soros) who cause upheaval in Albania so that THEY can kidnap kids and auction them to senators and members of the Washington elite.

            Excellent post. One more thing to add is the fact that Epstein flew a plane with the same tail numbers as the CIA used. There was a posting about this before, but it was probably deleted.

            This is old news to me. It is not even enough for me to see the CIA abolished. They should all be prosecuted and executed asap. Eveyone involved in all their crimes over the years, even from the 70's, should have all their crimes exposed and they should all go down for good. It should serve as a lesson of what happens when those who are supposed to protect instead chose to commit heinous crimes againt their own people and the world. Why do they still exist?

             CIA was formed from the Old OSS, masterminded by Reinhard Ghelen who was reicruited via Operation Paperclip. Ties to the Nazis - on the surface they are against that which they support.

              Exactly and let's not forget Dr. Mengele himself. Worse let's take it to Freud and Jung and others. They have their own secret facility where it is all hidden. To even name it as has been presented many times would cause deletion.

            Your optimism is appreciated and you make many valid points that cannot be refuted, however history proves that a healthy dose of skepticism is needed. Remember he only kicked Epstein out of the resort - he didn't call the police and hold him accountable to the law. Remember he is friends with many who are implicated in pizzagate and criminal corruption. Remember the glowing remarks he made about Hillary. Are you sure he is really ready to go all the way?
           </p>
           <p>
            Trump will only drain the swamp, lock her up, and restore law and order to our communities if we hold his feet to the fire. Remember he is a lifelong deal maker, so if they cannot take him out or compromise him, they are all counting on him to make deals, while they shift their strategy.
           </p>
           <p>
            This is why the key is Racine, Wisconsin - it is an epicenter of criminal corruption that serves as a barometer for draining the swamp. If he cannot drain the swamp in Paul Ryan's backyard, he has no real intentions of being true to his word. Remember what tech companies he has been meeting with and the company he has kept so far. Is he keeping his enemies close, or is he hedging his bets? Trump cannot be trusted any more than James Comey, and we know that Comey was complicit about the criminal corruption and abuses everywhere while he hedged his bets. When it comes to this situation, there cannot be deal making. Either the law exists or it doesn't. Either equal protection exists or it doesn't. Either anti-trust exists or it doesn't. Either he will drain the swamp or he won't, and we will be left with a vast corrupt swampland with smarter criminals covering their tracks better behind faces like Ashton Kutcher and John McCain.

             Wrong he  did go to authorities on Epstein. Many were supponed, he called and willingly gave deposition testimony on video. Not pleading the 5th but told the Truth. Trump might have had some indesretions as he lived the Business success and his fame. He might have seen "brownstone" in Action. But he got out once he knew the truth. Then took action... banning Epstein from Maro-Laugo personally escorting him off property with security.
Called for "death penalty to child sex abuse" in 2012. He knew and was setting up everyone else to catch them all.

              He banned him from the resort, only after being forced to due to an irate parent of a victimized girl. When exactly did Trump call the police on Epstein? Do you have a source for that? Or are you talking about the other cases where Epstein was convicted for solicitation in Palm Beach? Please provide a source if you have one for Trump's report to the police about it.

              Don't forget about this Jane Doe case or the one from Katie Johnson that brings cause for concern:
             </p>
             <p>
              Jane Doe (proceeding under a pseudonym) filed a civil lawsuit against Donald Trump and convicted sex offender, Jeremy Epstein, for multiple acts of sexual and physical abuse, which occurred when the defendant was 13 years old. Specifically, the the plaintiff charged the defendants with: “Rape, sexual misconduct, criminal sexual acts, sexual abuse, forcible touching, assault, battery, intentional, and reckless inflection of emotional distress, duress, false imprisonment, and defamation.” Jane Doe v. Donald J. Trump and Jeffrey E. Epstein. “Defendant Trump initiated sexual contact with Plaintiff at four different parties. On the fourth and final sexual encounter with Defendant Trump, Defendant Trump tied Plaintiff to a bed, exposed himself to Plaintiff, and then proceeded to forcibly rape Plaintiff. During the course of this savage sexual attack, Plaintiff loudly pleaded with Defendant Trump to stop but with no effect. Defendant Trump responded to Plaintiff’s pleas by violently striking Plaintiff in the face with his open hand and screaming that he would do whatever he wanted. Exhs. A and B.”
             </p>
             <p>
              Jane Doe v. Donald J. Trump and Jeffrey E. Epstein.
             </p>
             <p>
              This time Trump needs to do more than ban criminals from his resort. Clearly he did not drain that swamp, as Epstein received a slap on the wrist and it is back to business as usual.

                Hopefully you are right, however until the swamp is really drained, caution should still be exercised in regards to Trump's true role. He has been in these circles for decades. Complicity is pandemic. This is how things have gotten to where they are now through our entire government and industries. Until those involved in criminal corruption are held accountable and cesspools of corruption like Racine, Wisconsin are drained, Trump cannot be trusted any more than Comey, McCabe, Kadzik, and a long line of many others who have been in a position of power enabling and condoning criminal corruption through complicity and deal making. Many of his appointments have been questionable at best. People can claim 4D and 5D chess, but the simple barometer to swamp draining and connecting the dots of pizzagate and global corruption rests in Racine, Wisconsin.
               </p>
               <p>
                While that Jane Doe may be lying, look up Jane Doe in Racine and see if her story is more believable. If you truly investigate Racine you will see how it is all connected. They didn't hold the Knights of Pythias parade or get involved in global sustainability for no reason. Let's not divide, let's unite and drain this swamp whether Trump will or not. Let's make him drain the swamp, even if that means holding his friends and business associates fully accountable.

                 Not discounting any of your truth. Trust me a little here been talking with you not yelling at you. Seems you have crucial info. about Rancine. Might not seem like anyone is listening we are. Obviously very hurtful for you and any (v) or witnesses to hold right now. 
Post your info with breadcrumbs. Give information in your title that indicates you know one city is not completely responsible and you grasp that. Then provide information for people to research your findings. It is not black &amp; white nothing ever is :)

                You can dismiss those claims if you wish, but there is no denying that Trump and Epstein had a relationship for many, many years, and that they run in the same circles. You can also dismiss the claims about Trump University and other scandals. Look at Trump's own statements about Epstein. Look at Trump's list of numbers in Epstein's black book. Trump is not clean, and can only be trusted as far as those he runs with. Trump is surrounding himself with swamp creatures. There are many questions about his integrity and willingness to really drain the swamp instead of making deals to give the illusion he is draining the swamp.
               </p>
               <p>
                The only way Trump will really drain the swamp is if the people force him to through Common Global Knowledge of the real pizzagate and criminal corruption. If he cannot drain the swamp of Racine, Wisconsin he has no intention of draining any swamp.

                It is all true and factual. You were debating about whether Trump actually called the police on Epstein or just slapped his wrist and banned him from the resort - where is your source? To link all the evidence about Racine, Wisconsin would be hundreds of pages. None of it can be disputed. Witnesses aren't receiving death threats for nothing. Look up the RICO case involving Racine for starters, or the high profile pedo cases. Or the Jane Doe case, or the Derby Wagner case, or the Tina Davidson case, or the Dennis Barry case, or the many, many others.
               </p>
               <p>
                What is happening in Racine, Wisconsin is horrifying. Dismiss it if you wish. Complicity is pandemic.

            Just to point out that Trump is immediately going after the "black budget" that funds the rogue contractors and see eye yay. Human trafficking/drug trafficking and next up will be organ trafficking. He keeps pointing out Chicago.... How many of those murder victims are missing organs when they leave hospital for morgue?

             He hired Feinberg and a bunch of Goldman Sachs guys. He fired Flynn. The jury is still out on Trump. He's in a unique position to do what JFK tried to do.

            VERY good post, thank you for putting it together. The CIA definitely seems to be involved in almost every shady thing that goes on. #5 though - I don't think he was necessarily listening to 440 hz music. You can see in the other tabs "before it's..". One can assume he was looking at Before It's News and they do have an

“Five U.S. companies owned or controlled by Lopez Bello and/or MFAA Holdings Limited have also been blocked as part of today's action.  These entities are the following limited liability companies registered in Florida:  1425 Brickell Ave 63-F LLC; 1425 Brickell Avenue Unit 46B, LLC; 1425 Brickell Avenue 64E, LLC; Agusta Grand I LLC; and 200G PSA Holdings LLC.  Additionally, a U.S.-registered aircraft with the tail number N200VR has been identified as blocked property owned or controlled by 200G PSA Holdings LLC.”

             Of course it did. Search Wikipedia/Youtube for Air America, Gary Webb, Iran-Contra, Kill The Messenger. The CIA has self-funded through illegal drug sales since at least the 1950s.

              No wonder why Trump made fighting drugs such a big part of his campaign.

               I think he is just a 1950s Eisenhower, white picket fence guy who likes decency and family life. There is no room for cocaine and heroin in that.
              </p>
              <p>
               Earlier in his life, he was more libertine (so was I). He chased skirts, he watched people have sex at Studio 54, he got into the mafia-ridden casino business.

               Actually, probably the easiest and fastest way for Trump to shut down the CIA would be to legalize drugs and crack down on human trafficking and organ harvesting. Then it would have no money left.

                right, why drugs are illegal in the first place, not that I support drug addiction, but often the legal expenses ruin the lives of the families and does nothing for the addict.

                 Right. I'm not a fan of drugs. Just look at the heroin/crack shanty towns in Baltimore. But I think legalization might help.

                I think Trump likes a good fight, though, since he admires General Patton.

            Looks like you forgot the Finder's Cult. Very very important.
           </p>
           <p>

            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            Read this steemit article. Read the newsprint. Let me summarize. Finders cult was when some nicely dressed well educated men were caught with 6 dirty children that had been sexually abused. They were also busted with manuals on how to kidnap children and pictures of naked children. The Finders cult ran a software firm that trained the CIA in computer programming. The founder of the finders cult claimed that his wife worked for the CIA and that his son worked for a proprietary firm of the CIA.
           </p>
           <p>
            Edit: The FBI stopped the investigation of the Finders cult because it became an internal affair at the CIA. CIA isn't even a domestic agency.

            I formerly thought the Nazis were bad guys, but I no longer think that Germany was responsible for WW2. And I don't think Germany wanted war or was prepared for war. I think it was dumb of them to force peaceful Jews to leave Germany, but I understand now why many Europeans probably were very afraid of Jews. It was because the Bolsheviks in Russia were mostly Jews who took control and murdered millions of Russians. And they gave every indication of intending to do the same in the rest of Europe. There doesn't seem to be any good evidence that Germany was trying to exterminate Jews or committed a holocaust. It wasn't till last year that I discovered these things. I posted info here:
            <a href="http://forum.freestateproject.org/index.php?topic=28418.msg298878#msg298878">

           </p>
           <p>
            I don't know if the stories of evil experiments by Nazi doctors and scientists in Germany were true and I don't know if there were evil groups in Germany who were brought to the CIA after the war. I read that there were snipers among the Allies who killed German soldiers and officers even when they surrendered. And the allies were responsible for destroying Germany's infrastructure and thus cutting off food supplies and that's why the labor camp people were starving, just as most Germans were also starving. The allied bombing intentionally targeted civilians too. So I now think the allies were largely the guilty party in WW2. And the Jewish-controlled media deceived the allied troops into fighting the wrong enemy.

             I'm sympathetic to all of these ideas, but I don't know what the final truth is. If the CIA is evil, and the CIA is filled with Nazis, but Nazis aren't that bad... then I'm confused again.

              That's what I'm saying too, i.e. that I'm somewhat confused. It's possible that there were some evil Nazis and they're the ones who joined the CIA, the VA etc. But I need to see evidence first, before I'll feel more confident about what's the truth.

               Seems a lot of Occult stuff with certain Nazi.  Himmler and Heydrich come to mind.  Seems they ran lots of the dirty stuff and some historians say Himmler was doing lots of stuff behind Hitlers back.  Hitler joked about the new religion that Himmler was making around him.  He seemed to mock it but maybe he should of taken more control and brought that stuff to heel.  Lots of evidence Himmler was the Deep State link to the Globalist Council of 300.  Even some evidence that Hitler did not agree with the Night of Broken Glass.....that that was done without his approval.  And some evidence that the beginnings of the culling of the Jews in Russia was a Himmler inspired gambit.  There are decoded radio transmissions about a group of Jews sent to Russia and Hitler being told they were liquidated upon arrival....Hitler seems pissed off and says no more of that crap.  Himmler seems to kind of panic about it......and scrambles to cover his tracks...

               It is all very foggy what really happened in WW2.   But I think we have all been fed a line of bullshit.  Nothing is what it seems.  We are not the good guys........there is something very wrong in the world.

            Excellent post, thank you. Just wanted to add this interview with German journalist Udo Ulfkotte (who has since died) discussing his own personal experience of how the CIA plant stories in the European media

             Thanks. That is part of the Mockingbird media. The stuff revealed in the Church Committee was just 1%. The CIA has infiltrated all major media. But we still have the internet and alternative media.

              She's not charismatic, and she's always being slandered, but she makes absolute sense, and there are thousands who have accepted what she says as the truth. I have. I would give her another shot. That's the thing (as you may know), the truth usually doesn't come packaged neatly for us, you have to dig and work a little. Chew the meat and spit out the bones. Edit: the 911 truth movement is controlled opposition, they've been "taken over," and are quite happy for us to settle on "nano-thermite."

               I agree with you on Judy Wood.  I think some people are okay with thinking "outside of the box" but just not that far outside of the box.  She's asking questions that leave open some pretty mind-blowing possibilities.  And while she's not charismatic, as you say, she's very detailed and speaks precisely.  That was my take on some of her presentations anyway.  I think that someday she'll be pointed to as someone who got it right about 9-11.

                Agreed. I really had an "aha" moment with her. Thanks. (Yeah, mind-blowing possibilities, and all too fantastical for some, but it just makes so much sense.)

               It was a combination of everything, nano thermite, energy weapons (for 3 weeks they could not extingush molten metal) , Holograms.... CGI Psyop. All part of Masonic Ritual - the twin towers represented Jachin &amp; Boaz - the twin pillars of the Solomon's Temple (Masonic Allegory for high initiates - street masons are given literal temple misleading them on purpose, all a luciferian doctrine as penned down by Albert Pike in Moral's &amp; Dogma)

            I just thought of something: How EASY would it be for these agencies with INFINITE resources to duplicate ANYBODY in video or audio? We have seen proof of this technology so you can only imagine how advanced THEIRS is.

            I bring this up because of some EXTREMELY sketchy looking demo videos (with real people but almost too perfect if you know what I mean) in some Indiegogo and Kickstarter campaigns.
           </p>
           <p>
            I'm thinking SOME* in the intelligence community use this as a means of fundraising for one thing or another.

            Don't forget to watch Evidence of Revision (it's long but incredible) and watch James Files interview on youtube (talks about the CIA in the Kennedy years, a must-watch), and the book Mary's Mosaic. David Lifton Evidence of Revision, Douglas Horne Inside the ARRB, one could go on and on ... I am facebook friends w/ some of the surviving witnesses and key players of that time... good luck!

               Interesting. Of course, an attractive woman who grew up under the CIA - you would expect her to be a victim. People don't realize that the CIA is evil.

            Terry Reed was a pilot for the CIA first in Vietnam and later in Central America to Mena Airport. His book is called Compromised. He discovered that arms were being exchanged for drugs or something like that. His pilot friend Bobby Sands or Seals (okay, Barry Seal) had evidence that the Bush bros. were cocaine users and the govt exposed Bobby at a trial so cartel people would murder him afterward. Reed's book opens with a statement by President Truman that he never meant for the CIA to have so much clandestine powers when he signed the bill creating the CIA in 1947 or so. They used legal trickery to give themselves those powers via interpretation.

             Barry and the Boys by Hunsicker is THE expose on Seal.
            </p>
            <p>
             Barry Seal was from my hometown and was assassinated there in broad daylight -- before he could testify -- after a fed judge left him a sitting duck. \Bush Sr's personal phone number was on his person.

             Yes, I've watched the entire video on the Mena Connection on youtube. Tom Cruise is making a movie about Barry Seale (American Made) comes out this year. See also Air America and Kill the Messenger.
            </p>
            <p>
             Funny thing is - I can't find Terry Reed online. Did he get suicided like Michael Ruppert and Gary Webb?

              You know I fear that, very much, too. The problem for the CIA is that any assassination would be investigated by people like you and me.

              It would be hard to pull off 9/11 or JFK today. Too much VOAT, too much Youtube, too much Reddit, too much investigation. They can't control the narrative.

                The jury is out on Pence. He seems to be part of firing Flynn - the only big Trump supporter to tweet about #pizzagate. And he's knee deep in the oil business.

               I think that's why these "disasters" are in places that we aren't really checking up on as a group of citizens.  It's very easy to be sad about Paris being bombed but did anyone bother to really look into it?  I know I didn't.  I know that I haven't looked
               <em>
                at all
               </em>
               at the death of Kim Jong Un's step brother or whoever it was.  There are still acts, I believe, that are being carried out by the same entity...it's just not happening on American soil.
              </p>
              <p>
               Here, we don't look too much into it for a different reason.  The attacks on American soil are highly organized protests and memes.  How do we vet the protesters?  How do we vet the organizers if we don't know them...they aren't household names.
              </p>
              <p>
               These have been my thoughts on the subject.

                 I made that comment at the last big "BLM THUGS ATTACK LOCAL COMMERCE IN CITY LOOTING BLACK LIVES MATTER IS EVIL" thing. I said "Um, anyone else find it suspicious that these guys are in ski masks? Like, none of those people in the crowds noticed some guys in a ski mask and thought to stop them?"

                 I also thought that about the whole "Knockout Game" when black youth were just punching people out for fun.

                Steven Pinker argues that the world is getting less violent. If that is true, then we should expect the military industrial complex to engage in more false flag terror, not less.

                 Well, right.  Because these machines, who/whatever, and governments are working toward goals that aren't necessarily shared by their people.  If DJT's has taught me anything, it's that people know that the government is doing fuck all and
                 <strong>
                  claiming

                 to represent us and they're not.  The people know it.  Three thousand something counties worth knew that, and DJT told them "we are going to work for you again...you just see..."

             But the illuminati are a bunch of delusional inbred psychopaths who function primarily on the backs of their minions, intelligence mercenary groups. Social engineers, think tanks such as Brzesinski etc... take out the minions and on their own Illuminati members would starve to death - they are parasites who cannot function on their own. Once a critical mass of people 10 to 15% awakens from their slumber it is all over for the controllers. You take out the minions that feed the beast, and the beast will starve to death. Too easy, we are many they are few. See the cartoon Bug's Life - powerful scene.

             Perhaps. But the Illuminati doesn't seem to (fully) control Trump. Nothing does. At least, the jury is still out.

            I'M SO HAPPY THE PUBLIC IS FINALLY DISCOVERING THE TRUTH OF THE CIA'S EVILNESS.

            I was hopeful back in the 70s during the Watergate investigation that Senator Church's committee's hearings on the CIA and FBI would start the process of cleaning up corruption, but the CIA-controlled media covered it up. Now I'm hopeful that today is a different story.

              This is why we need something solid, something really damaging, like proof of Mossad involvement in 9/11. I hope vault 7 is exactly that.

                You are right there is a feeling of build up. Hope it's not in our heads. 
Ps - two more redpilling CIA operations are BROWNSTONE and GLADIO. The latter more NATO but totally wakes people up if they investigate. I find Mockingbird and Gladio are the most useful to wake people up because they are so blatant and easily proven

                 Yes, I'm familiar with those. Brownstone is not a former CIA operation (like Operation Cyclone) - it's a colloquial term to describe a sex blackmail operation, like Operation Midnight Climax.
                </p>
                <p>
                 I should probably add Gladio to the original post. George Webb has good stuff about Gladio.

             Yeah, I date the decline to the 1965 Immigration Act and the closing of the gold window, but the creation of the CIA is a third pillar that I should add - right when JFK got shot.
            </p>
            <p>
             The nice thing is that the U.S. is much older, going back to 1776. So if had to live with 70 years of CIA corruption, perhaps we can shake it off.

              CIA was created in '46 by Allen Dulles et al.  Dulles was a known pedo, BTW!  His "best friend" was Prescott Bush.
             </p>
             <p>
              U.S. declared independence from Britain in 1776, but U.S. Constitution wasn't ratified until 1789.  (We were MUCH better off under the Articles of Confederation before then).

               It's also tied with the terrifying plan of the satanists who have been cultivating this for centuries.  This goes back farther than the cia.  They will not give up.  I'm hoping they can be stopped, but by whom?  They have the money and power.

                Money and power mean nothing compared to the truth. As long as there is an outlet for truth, there is a chance that the world can be saved. It sounds strange but the key to unlocking the gates is Racine, Wisconsin - it ties to every single aspect of pizzagate and global corruption. Rather than trying to catch Bigfoot, the better answer is to prove that he is not real. There is a lot of money and power in Racine, Wisconsin. But the truth is worth so much more. Trump needs to start with draining the swamp in Paul Ryan's backyard if he really intends to drain the swamp. Everything is connected from there right up to the Clintons and Soros to the Rothschilds and Rockefellers to the Vatican. Is Timothy Dolan the future American Pope? Guess what area he is from.

This post is the truth.  and I can believe it more because "I know a guy"  and what I know of this guy, well pretty much aligns to a tee with everything I've heard about guys like him from post like this.

              As someone who has done the research (up to 14 hours a day for months on end, since 1996) on this subject I can tell you it is all correct. Anybody who deviates from the CGI Psyop with regards to 9-11 is either a shill or a ignorant.

               Im even questioning the history we were taught. I talk to southern family and they have their version of the civil war that they swear by, of course ours was much different. Larry Flynt wrote a book on sex in the wh, pretty good read, it goes back far. Some were cuckolds!

               Hell I question everything, and am paranoid parrot wondering what's next? Mostly because I sense another 9/11 in my gut :/ if Trump is killed somehow I'm prepared to fight, that's going to break my personal dam, it is already cracked.  I'm sure many of us feel cracked now. 9/11 was too coordinated it takes skill to hit buildings. And I never saw a plane hit that pentagon. I know there were cameras all over the place near the pentagon, that'd be a nice Wikileaks if it were to involve 9-11. I don't believe the cgi tricks, I have friends that called me that were traumatized. I think real folks died, the ciamossad machine cares not that they die, it's psy warfare (damn my auto correct even left my ciamossad unchecked, it even knows!) Cee Eye Ay needs to be put down like the lame horse it is.

                One former pilot issued a $100 000 challenge to any beginner Cesna pilot to give it a try at navigating boeing 767 from boston to NY and hitting the targets in a flight simulator, without the AID OF GROUND CONTROL - it proved an impossibility except for a select TOP GUN PILOTS!!!!!! And of course assuming the shutdown of entire NORAD!!!!

                The main proponant of the CGI plane trick came down to be "Simon Shack" who is a shill claiming no one died and the Builings were empty... Not True..
               </p>
               <p>
                But Shack is correct on the "cartoon planes"

                Typical Psy-op - mixes honey with the poison. You can easily out him as a shill when you witness how arrogantly he deals with questions, how he tags others as "agents" with vitriol and vile smears. And how he bans people on his own level of research but cultivates the newbies. He manages his board by cultivating ass - kissers.. If anyone breaths any contradiction to what he says they are banned instantly.

            Yes 100%. The CIA itself was created at the impetus of the CFR and Brown Brothers Harriman, aka the Harriman and Rockefeller dynasties. There is reason to think that the Harriman and Rockefeller dynasties became dynasties because they were offered essentially infinite credit from the private owners of the Bank of England, aka the Rothschilds. In other words, all roads lead back to the Rothschilds if you follow the money. Funny how they keep popping up in this investigation. The CIA was meant to be a private army of the oligarchs within the government

             Everything connects to Racine, Wisconsin - from the Pilgrims Society, Knights of Pythias, Bilderberg, and Council on Foreign Relations to the Rockefellers, the Zika Virus, Sustainability and UN Agenda 21. Racine, Wisconsin is the key to solving this entire puzzle - it is the home district of Paul Ryan.

              Random muse.  "Jack" in Titanic [film] came from Chipewa Falls Wisconsin.  Any significance?  In-joke or 1% signalling.  For a small town they have a fair list of successes.

               He does exactly what they tell him to and looks so innocent, but is one of the most guilty. He is well aware of the brazen corruption and evil both surrounding him and in his own district and he benefits from it. He protects them, and they protect him. It is abominable.

             Yes, that is where my investigation is leading too. It was VERY interesting to see Lynn Rothschild call Podesta a loser on Twitter.
            </p>
            <p>
             The funny thing is, before I got into conspiracies and geopolitics, I admired all of the riches and wealth and opulence of the Rothschilds. I kind of naively believed that they were just really good at banking. Not that they are part of some weird, inbred, Satanic, mass terror and racketeering operation.

              Looks like you forgot the Finder's Cult. Very very important.
             </p>
             <p>

              </a>
             </p>
             <p>
              Read this steemit article. Read the newsprint. Let me summarize. Finders cult was when some nicely dressed well educated men were caught with 6 dirty children that had been sexually abused. They were also busted with manuals on how to kidnap children and pictures of naked children. The Finders cult ran a software firm that trained the CIA in computer programming. The founder of the finders cult claimed that his wife worked for the CIA and that his son worked for a proprietary firm of the CIA.
             </p>
             <p>
              Edit: The FBI stopped the investigation of the Finders cult because it became an internal affair at the CIA. CIA isn't even a domestic agency.

             And if you just think who is behind the CIA who started it.....who contols it......and you will finally see the truth.  Council of 300.  MI6, Mossad, English and European Royals and the Rothschild Jews who infiltrate all of those groups using Money, Sex Magik bullshit.   With the advent of the Photograph they really could ramp up their blackmail.

                Judge against Trump's immigration order in Seattle, Podesta teaches there, Katherine McCarthy assistant to dean, daughter of former dean, age 45, died several months after talking on phone to potus about 111d (I think that is clean air act, why is she talking to potus about this? very strange), weird beanie baby email by Peter Mattingly sent to whole admin, thats just a few. It really needs a closer look, especially into a possible connection to all the judges that are giving free rides to rapists and CP.

                 Oh I agree that Georgetown is a hot bed. Bill Clinton and Podesta went there, I believe. I just don't have hard, direct proof of CIA involvement. University of Denver has more evidence of a CIA connection.

                      WJC cites Quigley as his biggest influence, and is probably who got him the Rhodes scholarship, we all know Rhodes was a famous homo, whose philosophy is the origins of NWO ideology, so even if Quigs wasn't a paid cia asset, he was certainly living among them. There are others here who I hope will have more info.

            Now just have to explain the C.I.A. Stands for Catholics in Action. Intelligence supportin Nazi's was C.I.A directed by Vatican directly. (W) child of SS inner circle with Priiests who used the power of Vatican covertly. Involved in horrific crimes. USA sent young soldiers to fight
In D-Day.  Secret societies had infiltrated from Vatican then quietly changed identities. Rich political operatives who JFK called out. Let's start releasing real evidence.

             I don't think they are specifically catholics, I think that they just don't mind associating with anyone who they can do business with (mafia). I think they infiltrate every group that they can.

            Yes they are evil to the core....they use the normals working there as cover....everything is so compartmentalized that the average employee has little idea they are working for the Dark Lords.  But they need to be on notice....they need to watch everything that goes on around them.  If they see something they think is wrong they need to remember the oath they swore....they sore to defend the Constiution from enemies foreign and domestic.  The oath gives them the cover to leak to any agency they feel will actually report the truth....

            Well sourced and comprehensive! I would consider archiving everything since they will likely take all this down when they see it. Hopefully the CIA gets discredited in the news soon before they fight the pizzagate movement fully

              And let's not leave out Operation Northwoods, a plot to paint a military aircraft as civilian, blow it up and blame it on cube ala 9/11.
Here's the story &amp; the original declassified document. And people think 9/11 is "farfetched" lol.

              Fantastic post party 1981! Great to see it all here in one spot. The CIA budget is something like 45 billion/trillion whereas the NSA for example is like 9 billion/trillion. Sorry I don't recall the billion/trillion part, just the fact the CIA gets about as much money as everyone else combined including the defense dept. The CIA is the head of the deep state for sure, I know there's lots of good patriots there but it has to be dismantled and those folks moved into something more transparent to congressional oversight.

             This is a quality post, and the CIA is just the beginning. The CIA is the Joe Pesci to the mob bosses within the hierarchy of secret societies and evil elite. The entire government is compromised, and very few have actually tried to bring out the truth such as FBIanon. The rest are either involved or complicit to ruining America. Complicity is treasonous and pandemic.
            </p>
            <p>
             The FBI, DOJ, NSA, DHS and other agencies all play their role in the network of criminal corruption and complicity along with the media, and a large sector of the national, state and local legislative, judicial and executive branches. The real key however is the network of integrated, infiltrated and controlled groups across the board - teamsters, chambers of commerce, service groups, secret societies, schools, media, NGOs, non-profits, churches and foundations. They mix legitimate with illegitimate, real news with fake news, political with criminal, and good with evil.
            </p>
            <p>
             Every corner of the world and the global network has been compromised, and people need to understand how this directly affects them. This is not a distant and incurable problem. There is a key to unlocking the entire puzzle, and it starts in Racine, Wisconsin - the home district of Paul Ryan and Reince Priebus. They, along with the agencies and authorities at all levels and the media, have all known about these problems nationally, globally and locally in Racine for example for years. They did nothing. They turned their back and allowed the laws and lives and rights of others to be abused.
            </p>
            <p>
             How did those two boy scout faces, Ryan and Preibus, become the leaders of the establishment along with McCain, Graham, etc. on one side, and Clinton, Kaine, Podesta, Schumer, Frank, Pelosi, Weiner, etc. on the other? There is a reason why. They are a good face to cover up the evil. Now Ashton Kutcher is coming out as another good face to cover up the evil. Bezos, Zuckerberg, Schmidt, Musk, Dorsey, to Jake Tapper. They are good faces covering for evil. The question is whether Trump is just another face covering for evil and making deals behind the scenes to find their Lee Harvey Oswalds and Bin Ladens to take the fall and their Warren Commission and 9/11 Commission to file their fake report for fake history classes. They will try to keep this all abstract and compartmentalized as they did with Pizzagate to narrow the scope to one single pizza shop and a staged gunman.
            </p>
            <p>
             We need to make this less distant and abstract, and make it real and up close. Every single puzzle piece related to Global Criminal Corruption, Secret Societies and the real pizzagate connects in one way or another back to Racine, Wisconsin. From the Pilgrims Society, Bilderberg and Knights of Pythias to Sustainability and Agenda 21 to pay to play racketeering and fake news, the evidence of criminal corruption in Racine is overwhelming, including direct connections to an astonishing number of secret societies, closed clubs and groups, and global foundations. The investigations into Racine, Wisconsin will show everyone how this is all connected and how it directly affects, threatens and ruins real people's lives on a daily basis.
            </p>
            <p>
             Who killed Seth Rich? Who killed Paul Wellstone? Who killed JFK? Who killed Andrew Breitbart? Who killed Michael Hastings? Who killed Monica Peterson? Who killed millions and built an entire network of corruption, tyranny and pure evil? Instead of trying to find a shape-shifting boogeyman with no accountability or real change, look at Racine, Wisconsin and begin connecting the dots. The dominoes will all fall from there right up the chain from the city to the state to the nation to the world. The world is so corrupt it must be reverse engineered to undo it.

              I think that people see "Racine, Wisconsin" and think "What on earth is that person talking about?" It might help to point out that Racine, WI is just north of Chicago on Lake Michigan. Everybody is familiar with Chicago's long history of dirty politics and its role in the criminal underworld all the way back to Al Capone. The district in Wisconsin you're talking about is the south-eastern-most counties in Wisconsin, which border Chicago's northern suburbs. They are the counties where Chicago's wealthy spent/spend their summers in wealthy enclaves like Lake Geneva.
             </p>
             <p>
              I don't know much about Racine. But it wouldn't surprise me at all that the part of Wisconsin you're talking about that borders the northern Chicago suburbs and which Paul Ryan represents, would have lots of people with lots of connections to the 1% and to the deep state.

               You are correct - Racine and southeast Wisconsin is a playground for the elite. Paul Ryan is the playground supervisor. The mafia is well connected throughout the area and has partnerships with the corrupt secret societies, and they have infiltrated all legitimate organizations, groups and business associations. They control the media and have created a bubble much like DC where the laws do not apply those those who are above them or abusing them under the color of law.

              We are very close now, imo, to seeing full scale "Fourth Reich" being unfurled here.
Sadly, many in lower sphere go along with violence until they come to see grasp the true reality.

               I'm all in favour of state-enforced violence against paedophile rings, traitors, and ruthless enemies. The USA was infiltrated by a  politically organised criminal network that subverted all branches of the  U.S. government following the assassination of JFK; when the conditions were ripe, this criminal network intended to apply genocidal violence against large sections of the  American population..  (This scenario was narrowly avoided by the election of Donald J. Trump.)
              </p>
              <p>
               My point is that
               <em>
                you
               </em>
               may be against violence but the enemy will not be any less violent towards you.  The moment he has consolidated his power, he will  not hesitate to unleash the maximum degree of violence against American citizens to affirm the political legitimacy of the newly constituted government,  and eliminate any potential sources of opposition. He will apply violence to force compliance with policies   destructive to the American people and calculated  solely to maximise the profits of social interests groups (from the pharmaceutical industry to the child sex traficking lobby), to secure the interests of foreign lobby groups (mainly Saudi Arabia and Israel —  too very close close that collaborate behind the scenes in everything from terrorism to the buying and selling of child sex slaves from Eastern Europe and the United States — a very lucrative industry in the Near East, where the blondest children yield the highest profits), to put an immediate stop to the spread of the kind of information regularly discussed on this subreddit, or just to satisfy the arbitrary whims an oligarchy of amoral sociopath   that delights in your  degradation and misfortune.
              </p>
              <p>
               We are not dealing with a regular  enemy. This is a vast criminal network that makes money off human death, harvesting of human organs, human traficking, child prostitution, weapons trading, illicit drugs, snuff films torture, illegal human experiments on behalf of the pharmaceutical and emerging biotech  industries, large-scale financial fraud, stealing the material and  resources of other countries on behalf of transnational corporations, spread of life-threatening diseases requiring medical treatment or vaccination, etc., etc.
              </p>
              <p>
               Such an enemy scoffs at everything you value. He regards your 'nonviolence' as a weakness that he'd like to see more widely distributed throughout the domesticated herd population (as he sees it). He wants  nonviolencce to be perceived as a great moral 'virtue" with quasi-spiritual undertones.  He wants see this 'ideal'  thoroughly bred  into the population as a deeply ingrained universal  human trait; he wants to be able to slice your throat and  snatch  children off the streets at will, without risking a violent retaliation. The more 'peaceful' and 'nonviolent' the populace is, the more he views you and your children as his personal property.

                Actually, in my brief comment (which wasn't clear) I was talking about people like J. Edgar Hoover/FBI who would go along with violence (assassination of JFK and MLK, Jr., etal) but when he allegedly began to get anxious about the depth of Gestapo-minded take-over then he may have begun to resist.

                Similar to how we see the CIA compartmentalized (or Scientology or other secret organizations) so that only higher up's really know what the real agenda is.  When agents move up and it becomes clearer then some leave and some try to Whistleblow.

                However, I do think pushing revolution in US which would involve violence would be a mistake for the American public - the MIC of today is quite different from what our Founders faced.  Any revolution here, imo, has to be based in non-violent resistance and non-cooperation with capitalism/Elitism.

                I'm not in favor either of torture or violence against anyone the state holds prisoner, but have great concerns about the arrests of pedophiles and what ultimately happens, like what kind of jail sentences they would ultimately receive.  Too often they are arrested and then quickly released or released after short sentences and then the pedophiles rings are put back together again.  And, as we've seen in UK and Belgium and here in US, often the government blocks or shuts down investigations as they begin to threaten higher up's in government, professions, military, police enforcement. Belgium similar to Franklin Case in UK ...

                NYPD Jim Rothstein in an interview with Prof. Jim Fetzer made that clear in saying that in over a 50 year period there were 3 investigations of pedophiles rings and their violence, including SRA's -- but that each time they were stopped when the higher up's were being named.  He also related that a "book" of names was in possession of Larry O'Brien, Director of the DNC at the time of Watergate break in.  One of the investigations which was stopped had gone all the way to the NY State Senate which was holding hearings.

                The infiltration of our government was put in play two years before the end of WWII -- see Operation Mockingbird -- and it was partnered with two other programs (Operation Paperclip and Operation Gladio) which were intended to cripple democracy anywhere, including here in the US.  The JFK coup, of course, took not only our president but our government.

                True, you could look at this as though it is war -- but it is usually women and children who suffer most in any war.
But it is not Iran which has declared war anywhere, nor Libya, nor Syria -- nor Russia.  It is the US which has been involved in starting 100's of wars.  All of the terrors of war that you are describing can be attributed to the behavior of the US.  I'd also suggest that the situation with torture at Guantanamo suggests to me that the CIA was merely practicing there.  No dictatorship could run here or has run anywhere else without controlling their citizens by torturing them.

                Certainly he is not going to dismantle oil industry nor Big Pharma as they are both part of the "National Security State."
And certainly, at some level all over the world, higher up's in government are involved in human sex trafficking, including trafficking of children.  Even Royals -- and even the RCC and religious institutions, orphanages, etal.

                 Aside from falling for the known CIA-planted disinformation concerning the supposed 'Nazi conspiracy', a very good analysis. (The whole 'Nazi' angle that is being pushed by establishment-approved 'conspiracy theorists' is a false narrative based on selectively chosen half-truths. It's meant to point us towards a false path; when you go down that path, it
                 <em>
                  seems
                 </em>
                 to be the right path until you reach its end.  I have gone down that path, believing that Nazis were the source of problems tied to the CIA and other groups. But when I finally reached the end of the path — and   exhausted all of the information available on the subject — I realised that I had been deceived. You can pursue that line of research if you want to find things out on your own, but I can assure you it isn't the Nazis that are behind anything — they are just a convenient scapegoat for the true source of the problem. It's not the  "Illuminati" either. You probably think I'm going to say  it's the Jews, but that is not  the case either. There is, however, a reason why the same people ruling over us have made anti-Semitism a big taboo through their control of the educational system and media — it's not because the Jews are pulling all the strings, but because élite Jewish bankers are the top servants of the one that is pilling the strings. These rich Jews use regular Jews as a kind of human shield to protect the financial interests of the Jewish élite — often at the expense of their 'lesser' Jewish brethren. Next in the hierarchy is a network of globalist Jews (and some non-Jews) who, in turn, use the Freemasons and other secret fraternities that they infiltrated, as their own 'human shield'. And then, of course, the Freemasons, who have infiltrated the Catholic Church and other religious organisations, use the Catholics, etc. as their 'human shield' — their
                 <em>
                  mask
                 </em>
                 in the event that their subversive activities become known to the general public.  And so on down the hierarchy.)

                  Operation Mockingbird was being written two years before the end of WWII and served as a control and propaganda arm for the CIA for more than 60 years.  It wasn't until the late 1970's that Carl Bernstein wrote about Mockingbird in Rolling Stone.

                  And Mockingbird is still in operation:** Former Newspaper Editor Who Exposed CIA Found Dead **

                  At the same time, higher ups in the German military were visiting our Pentagon and making deals.  These men were used to found the CIA, funneled into the FBI and other government agencies and to "hot spots" all around the world.

                  The CIA/Gestapo has operated in secret for since the early 1940's via Allen Dulles' efforts, though it wasn't official until 1947.  This guaranteed the Cold War.  This influence and attempt at control and Mind Control can be seen on our government since the end of WWII.  Actually, I'd guess WWII isn't over yet as we defeated Germany but not fascism.

                  The CIA and the Nazis are the same thing -- and don't see that you have any counter-arguments or comments on the OP on the thread here to "party 1981."

                  Allen Dulles and Prescott Bush funded Hitler's rise to power, collecting money from Elites/Royals all over the world through their front companies.  They were finally busted by Congress -- but Prescott went on to serve in US Congress and Allen Dulles went on to serve dual duty in heading up the CIA while also assisting in moving Germany Military/Intelligence out via Vatican ratlines.  Including the Gold.  Allen Dulles converted American dollars to Gold and shipped it to Germany.  It also came back out.  The Catholic Church is referred to as "Catholics in action" by John Stockwell/CIA Whistleblower.  And RCC was corrupt from day #1 and didn't need anyone to infiltrate them to make them corrupt.  All of the secret organizations are corrupt, of course.

                  AND, if we can believe anything that James Jesus Angleton said, evidently he too like J. Edgar Hoover had regrets about those he served.

                   Just before his death, James Jesus Angleton, the legendary chief of counterintelligence at the Central Intelligence Agency, was a bitter man.  He felt betrayed by the people he had worked for all his life.  In the end, he had come to realize that they were never really interested in American ideals of "freedom" and "democracy."  They really only wanted "absolute power."

                  It is important to know the background as best we can of everything that has happened in this country.
We're still in the same gene pool.  And certainly the CIA/Gestapo is evil and has led us down an evil path.
Read MKULTRA if you doubt that or its relevance to pizzagate.

               Even the Racine Zoo is corrupt with pay to play racketeering, bid rigging, and kickbacks involving the same officials and their friends with direct links to Freemasons and other secret societies. Racine has a deep and dark history of secret societies, underground tunnels, and sacred burial mounds. It is the dialysis capital of the world, is known for one of the highest infant mortality rates in the nation, is a sanctuary city, and has major problems involving crime, drugs, gangs, mafia, pedophilia (see major cases), satanic murders, mysterious deaths, retaliation and blackballing, and extreme levels of corruption, complicity and cover ups. It is a completely controlled community that is used as a model for corruption under the guise of sustainability (see Agenda 21 and Bill Clinton), controlling everything from cradle to grave including all aspects of life -  education, insurance, healthcare, service groups, religion, community policing, surveillance, and lots of pizza. Pilgrims Society, Knights of Pythias, Scottish Rite Freemasons, Rotary and other groups are all closely tied to Racine. Connect Agenda 21, Zika Virus and Lake Michigan, and you will begin to understand the importance and why Paul Ryan is so powerful.

                 Dialysis is important for the organ harvesting aspect (kidneys). The elite travel from around the world to Racine for Dialysis care and transplants, and they have a network of donors lined up through drug and human trafficking programs.

             Yes, right now youtube seems like a bastion of free speech, better than facebook and Twitter. I don't expect that to last much longer (maybe one year).

              All the more reason for people to archive essential Youtube videos (use VLC to get source URL for video and download with a download manager) and reupload them to bittorrent, vid.me and other services.

               We are in the golden age of Youtube free speech right. It's not as bad there as facebook and Twitter. That won't last for long. Google has given in to Prism, and Eric Schmidt is a CIA stooge. Eric Braverman is now leading the Google Foundation.

              Google and Facebook is to surveillance and censorship as Ashton Kutcher and John McCain are to child trafficking and pizzagate. They have a lot to lose and have insulated themselves as our agencies do with private partnerships, but will Trump really drain the swamp and hold them all accountable or claim they are too big to fail and make deals to bail them out and move around the chairs?

               I would be really surprised if he drains the entire swamp. FBIanon said: "The FBI is facing the entire federal government here" and "it's like a tiger trying to eat an elephant."

               But if something major drops (like Podesta's face in the WorldCorp video), then civil unrest will force Trump and Sessions to act.

                Exactly right - which is why we have to force him to do what he said and follow through on draining the swamp whether he really was going to or not. The truth is not scary, some people have always known the truth. Common global knowledge of the truth is what will actually force the draining of the swamp. Wikileaks and the Panama papers are two of the closest we have gotten. It all needs to come out, but the key to really draining the swamp is not taking down the elephant. It is starting with showing the extreme level of real criminal corruption in our local communities that all tie together at the top. We have to take down the swarms of worker bees, or the queen bees will just be replaced or covered up by another Ashton Kutcher while the elephant continues to trample lives behind the curtains.
               </p>
               <p>
                This is why the answer to solving pizzagate and global corruption lies in Racine, Wisconsin, not John Podesta.

                 All it takes is one FBI/NYPD cop to upload an Epstein video to the torrent websites. I'm about 30% sure that's what WorldCorp is. We'll see.

                    Well it would fit in the sense that everything visual is blurry and obscure so the footage can be shared but without violating any child pornographers laws. That is what made me think it might have been intentionally leaked. I hope so too!

                      He is singing a kids show song that is sang in first person. He is changing the name of the character from Cailou to his own name (John). Who really is in the video is debatable and speculative, however there is enough circumstantial evidence to warrant full investigations and raids.

                       He's singing the actual line "I'm just a kid who's 4" with everything after "ju" slurred.  That anyone thinks he's singing "I'm John Podesta" is simply proof of the strength of confirmation bias.

                I remember during the presidential race for '16, my mother mentioned that she could not believe how many women her age had forgotten how brutally HRC dragged those victims through the mud for coming out and addressing the sexual abuse.  How she and Bill were terribly corrupt during Bill's presidency.  She said it for the whole year, "I can't believe these dumbasses can't remember anything she has done.  She isn't for women, and she certainly isn't for America."
               </p>
               <p>
                To be quite honest, until the drop of The Podesta Files, I was swept up in exactly what we are trying to counter with Pizzagate.  I WAS a shill, I just didn't know it.  Until I deleted Facebook recently, I had seen all of my Anti-Trump "Memories" and it is so clear to me how manipulated I was.
               </p>
               <p>
                I guess my real point is....it doesn't really matter that it took so long.  Just that it happened.  I'm happy to be awake today.

                 Thanks for the honest reflection. I had a similar journey, just a dozen years ahead of you. We've all had our journeys "out of the matrix". They come at time different times usually due to a trigger event which spurs a questioning of the narratives we have been fed. Not everyone is capable of it and a larger group still are capable but have had no trigger event to push them into a state of cognitive dissonance where they have to challenge their previous worldview.
Our greatest contribution now must be to help others on that journey. If we all commit to it, the exponential awakening will be unstoppable, but it comes first from a place of personal commitment and resolve for the fight.

                  Well said RedGreen.  It's a glaring world once you are redpilled.  I have mourned for what I thought was my country after I found out it was all smoke and mirrors.  I resolve, I commit to helping anyone who wants to know more.
                  <br/>
                  Thank you RedGreen and Palmitespo910.

                   Hey AngryMimi. Just wanted to say it isn't all smoke and mirrors. I think you may still have a false premise running in your OS. The CIA, the elected officials, the MSM retards, the corporate fatcats, the Hollywood stars...they aren't America. We are. And while there is plenty of smoke around here and more than one mirror, by far the majority is the same based, self-reliant, fair-minded human beings who crossed oceans to settle and build this country and make it the most amazing human concoction on earth. :-)  Just wanted to point that out.

                   :-) if you want to know what MY trigger event was you can read all about it on my blog here. Short version; I was a social worker who was forced out of the profession for objecting to "bearded children" (Muslim MEN migrants) being placed with vulnerable young girls under my care, because political correctness meant we couldn't challenge their claimed age and because Muslims have become a protected class in the UK

                 People have trouble realizing the truth about the CIA because of two things:
                </p>
                <ol>
                 <li>
                  The human brain is biased to think that the world is just. (
                  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Just-world_hypothesis">
                   https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Just-world_hypothesis)
                  </a>
                  ). It's like an illusion, and it makes everything look fair. We want to believe that the bad guys lose and good guys win. The reality is much more complicated and sinister.
                 </li>
                 <li>
                  The CIA controlled the mainstream media. For most of the CIA's existence, the mainstream media was concentrated and easy to control. Now it is fragmented, and we have the internet, and the CIA is losing the narrative. Things like the hit job on Milo, the "fake news" narrative, and everything else shows that the CIA is weak.

                  Yes I did notice that.  Their tactics that worked 5 years ago just aren't working anymore.  I did see something recently where it was talking about how advertising companies are getting very frustrated with the younger crowd lately because we aren't watching network television, so they can't sell things to us.  Maybe frustration also stems from not being able to control us.  Just a thought.

                    Breitbart was a major force behind this. He identified the Alinsky-ite threat before most and took action to fight it.

                     Yes. When all of the corruption is exposed, we should name aircraft carriers and space stations after whisteblowers. Andrew Breitbart. Gary Webb. Michael Ruppert.

              I'm not sure I believe this stuff, I kinda looked down the rabbit hole a few times and something is up with 911 and the BS official story, also no doubt there are abusers and pedophiles in Washington, Qatar, the Roman Catholic Church, Haiti, the BBC you name it these sick disgusting fucks seem to be in many, many places. 'Pizza-gate' just seems to wack to me....too ridiculous, something may be true but so far I have not made judgement yet, saying the Jews did the WTC attack or "9/11 was Mossad," that just seems dumb, I'm no fan of any of the bullshit the Jewish nuts do or not a fan of the State of Israel's stupidity but to blame Jews for everything and all things, that's just dumb!!... it seems like a dumbass pot smoking Arab conspiracy who see Jews hiding behind every fucking stone and a Jew under every rock...and btw FUCK the CIA they need to be broken up or in dire need of massive overhaul and reform, allowing US weapons to fall into ISIS hands was one of the dumbest moves in a long history of dumb moves by these idiots. The CIA was meant to just be a way to keep old guys who worked at the Office of Strategic Services in WW2 re-employed in another job but it grew into an ugly monster, interesting to see Lynn Rothschild twitter account publicly call out Podesta

               I understand your skepticism. I went through a similar realization process, slowly and painfully myself. I'm married to an amazing jewish woman and we were equally terrified to find out that Mossad was involved in the 9/11 attacks. It's a verifiable fact.
              </p>
              <p>
               Consider:
1) As the 9/11 attacks were taking place, 5 Mossad agents were caught filming the plane crashes, then dancing, cheering and high-fiving as the towers collapsed over thousands of innocent people – including firemen and policemen.
2) The names of the those Mossad agents/assets are: Sivan Kurzberg, his brother, Paul Kurzberg, Yaron Shmuel, Oded Ellner and Omer Marmari.
3) The guys were working for a Mossad front company in New Jersey called “Urban Moving Systems”, aka “Max Movers” and were most likely the demolition team who planted the explosives in the WTC complex.
4)They were at first detained by the FBI, then extradited back to Israel. Once in Israel,  they arrogantly proclaimed on Israeli TV that the reason they were in the US on 9/11 was to “document the event”.
How did they know there would be an event to document, if they were not involved in planning it? 
And even if they weren't involved in the planning, they knew about it. And let it happen! They filmed the attack and danced and cheered while thousands of people were murdered.
Guilty (of foreknowledge at the very least). 
5) Cui bono?
If you need further evidence, consider this:

               If you read my post carefully, you will see that I do not blame "the Jews" for "everything." I blame a corrupt portion of the Israeli intelligence organization, Mossad, under the direction of the revanchist, far-right Zionist Likud party in Israel, for 9/11 and perhaps also the Epstein operation. That's a tiny sliver of Jewish people around the world, and a tiny fraction of the conspiracy theories that I discuss. If you want to see the evidence, just watch any video on Mossad operations in 9/11 (the DEA report, the Fox News specials, the Salon article, the B Thing and Project Gelatin, the five dancing Israelis, and Christopher Bollyn's work).

              Obama pulled away from Syria at the last moment because as the US moved our Navy into position to fire on Syria, Russia moved their Navy into position to fire on our Navy. It was basically like we put a gun to the head of Syria and Russia put a gun to our head in response. Also, John Kerry went on an overnight flight to Syria for some last minute "negotiating," and Putin used the opportunity to call up Obama directly and negotiate peace and the removal of Syria's chemical weapons. I don't think Obama himself wanted the war, but his CIA handlers may have. At any rate, Obama backed down and I give him credit for that. More credit to Putin though

               That could be it. But if Obama was raised, brainwashed, and blackmailed by the CIA, I would have guessed that they would have more control over him?

             And now twitster and youtoob, right?
People just don't realize it, if they only unplugged...and not buy into this crap.  There was a time, not so long ago, that people wrote with pens and mailed letters, didn't buy crap from besos and paid in cash.  All this pgate stuff has caused me to unplug big time.  What a relief....
