<p>At first glance, there appears to be little rhyme or reason to the bewildering array of firms within the KBW Ventures portfolio.</p>
<p>There’s Geltor, a California-based start-up that makes plant-based collagen.  Prolacta, a life sciences company that is developing human breast milk fortifiers for premature babies, is already present in “40 percent of level three and four hospital neonatal units in the US now,” Prince Khaled points out. </p>
<p>Among the investments and partnerships that KBW Ventures is linked to is Beyond Meat, a Los Angeles-headquartered plant-based food manufacturer whose ‘Beyond Burger’ recently became available in the Gulf. JUST, another Californian producer, makes plant-based mayonnaise and a vegan egg alternative that has already been picked up by a number of America’s biggest retailers. Memphis Meats, based in San Francisco, is developing lab-grown (or ‘clean’) meat and has also seen interest not only from the likes of Tyson Foods and Cargill from the conventional meat industry but also from <strong>Bill Gates and Richard Branson</strong> as well. </p>

            Interesting little fact about Paradise fires: Paradise is very near Truckee, where John Podesta maintained a summer condo. Found a Voat thread about his vacation home in Truckee:
            <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/v/pizzagate/1664442">
             https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1664442
            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            Most striking was a comment JP made in a Politico article:
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             "John Podesta, Center for American Progress: “I am going to my condo in Truckee [Calif.], like I do every year — will sit on my porch and do conference calls 50 feet from where the Donner Party ate each other."
            </p>

            Don't knock me here, I'm just thinking critically. Sorry if this bursts your bubble, but facts are important.
           </p>
           <p>
            I'm finding that many of these supposed research posts on voat just use other voat posts to try to qualify their claims. And very often, those claims appear to have grown out of their own imagination. This OP appears to be one of them.
           </p>
           <p>
            A train line is being built to transport human trafficking victims from Los Angeles to Las Vegas? The wildfires in California are evidence of this?
           </p>
           <p>
            It sounds just like the stories about Jeffrey Epstein's island burning down, based on a single indistinguishable image. Or the claim that triangles and spirals refer to pedophilia, based on the decorations commonly found in many pizza parlors. No real proof. Just a lot of making connections that might not really be there. But if you keep piling it up........
           </p>
           <p>
            The mods demand sources for a reason, but not every little claim can be expected to be sourced, and that allows little things to creep in that aren't necessarily accurate, but influence people's thinking in a particular direction.
           </p>
           <p>
            Some quoted examples:
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             It appears at least some of the fires were intentional...
            </p>
           </blockquote>
           <p>
            What percentage of fires appeared to be intentional? How were they determined to be intentional? Who determined?
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             The highway bloodline of i-15 is critical to the movement of drugs, weapons and humans.
            </p>
           </blockquote>
           <p>
            Why is it critical? How do you know this? Who says so? Why are other routes no good?
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             ...Alwaleed bin Talil, the same billionaire that was arrested. It is alleged that he is part of a human trafficking operation run out of these top floors...
            </p>
           </blockquote>
           <p>
            Who claims that he runs an operation out of the hotel? What evidence is there of that?
           </p>
           <p>
            And then there are deeper innuendos being made that are left to the reader to make the connections themselves, such as connecting Richard Branson and others to human trafficking through their investments in Twitter (huh?).
           </p>
           <p>
            Making small unverified claims to support larger claims doesn't equate to logical thinking and it's not valid research. In this case, it looks more like research efforts that came up empty, but the author has a theory that he/she doesn't want to let go of or research further before posting.
           </p>
           <p>
            The premise of the OP just lacks any real substance, as do many of the other voat posts it uses as sources. The initial claim that wildfires are being purposely set in order to build a rail line switched tracks (pun intended) and became a claim that the people named are somehow all mutually connected to human trafficking by way of their investments in Twitter.
           </p>
           <p>
            HUH???

            These fires are caused from DEWs and further the company PG&amp;E were in the vicinity according to one local for two weeks prior to the fires doing odd things in and around the Neighborhood. There is also a lot of talk that the fire fighters complained of the water in the fire hydrants were turned off for several hours when they were starting to fight fires on neighboring homes. There is also footage of homes burning from their $mart Meters that is where the fire starts. Someone claimed they chem trail the sky’s two days before then amp up the cell towers to 5G the highest they will go then use the Direct Energy Weapons to amplify it all and the $mart Meters are also turned up to burn the homes of individuals. With the chem trails and Haarp together they can control wind and they can make those “firenados”. Everything is burned to the ground completely except plastic like recycling bins because plastic is microwave proof. Trees are spared it’s beyong unbelievable people still think it’s a natural fire. So evil to the very core.

            The quality of education given to the lower class must be of the poorest sort, so that the moat of ignorance isolating the inferior class from the superior class is and remains incomprehensible to the inferior class. With such an initial handicap, even bright lower class individuals have little if any hope of extricating themselves from their assigned lot in life. This form of slavery is essential to maintain some measure of social order, peace, and tranquillity for the ruling upper class.

              The Mods have proven to be Corrupt and Untrustworthy, pushing a False Prophet while Hiding The Truth.

              The mods have both engaged in this behavior and have encouraged it against anyone who Shares The Truth.

             Finally, the Clinton Foundation is directly connected to Prince Al Waleed bin Talal of Saudi Arabia. The prince has done business not only with the Clinton's, but also with Michael JacksonYouTube. For the record, I still do not get any bad vibes from Michael, but him popping up among these other people may explain some of Michael Jackson's more cryptic statements about the elite/occult. However, Jackson and bin Talal did buy a controlling stake in Landmark Entertainment, which was founded by Gary Goddard. Goddard's Landmark Entertainment is a massive company with a lot of big-name hotels, casinos, and them parks as clients. Now, Goddard has been accused of pedophilia as recently as November of 2017. Back in 2014, Goddard was sued for similar behavior along with fellow DEN investors Brock Pierce and Bryan Singer.

             Just days before his arrest, Al-Waleed reportedly contacted US-based Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi (who has publicly criticized the Saudi government in the past) and invited him to return to the Kingdom in order to contribute to Mohammad bin Salman's vision

Al-Waleed owns the 65th-largest private yacht in the world, the 85.9-meter (282-ft) Kingdom 5KR (originally built as the Nabila for Saudi arms dealer Adnan Khashoggi in 1979). In 1983, owned by Khashoggi, it appeared as the Flying Saucer (the yacht of James Bond's villain, Largo) in Never Say Never Again. It was sold to Donald Trump, who renamed her the Trump Princess. Al-Waleed bought the yacht after Trump experienced financial problems in the late 1980s

            One thing I've noticed about the wildfire/train meme is that there isn't any fire burning in Nevada right now, so at least part of the meme/map might be inaccurate

             There doesn't need to be a fire in that part of Nevada to make this plausible as all that area is essentially empty desert.
            </p>
            <p>
             Nevada is a large state geographically, with a fairly low population. There is LOTS of open land.

               Oh ok, I see the distinction. I was just adding what I know about that stretch between ca and LV. Not a lot out there so really there would be nothing that would need to be cleared out by a fire.

               No, it's really Sacramento. What I meant is there are a number of players involved so the picture is more complex than simply looking at the 2018 California fires.  One needs to go back in time a bit and also think about what other organisations might be interested in swift access to the proposed high speed rail.

            These crazy mother fuckers want people in morgues probably to hide drugs, money, and guns in. Explains mass shootings, human trafficking, and the torture rings and SRA. Bad Boys 2 was real. I was kidnapped by cops when i was in middle school and high school, Now i know why. And unrelated to the cops kidnapping me but when i was in middle school i was visiting my grand parents and i look out the front of the window and i seen this bitch dressed like all in black like a cult costume with a hooded robe and her whole face was covered in a black mask and it looked she couldn't even see out the damn thing and it wasn't normal Halloween costumes you find at the store. It was real cult stuff. It was so terrifying and different. And she was walking down the street. I keep thinking it was this one butt ass ugly unfuckable third world FBI piece of shit shit head i hate and have a grudge against. Witch bitch. Its ggot to be her. Biggest bitch in the whole wide damn fucking world.

             Vineyard Owner Pelosi Defends ‘Joe Sixpack’ Against the Rich With Their ‘Champagne Glasses Clinking’
            </a>
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, who together with her husband owns a vineyard in the Napa Valley, went to the House floor on Wednesday to condemn the Republican majority for working against the interests of a person she called “Joe Sixpack” in order to cut taxes for “wealthy families” swigging champagne.....
            </p>
            <p>
             The Los Angeles Times published story on Nov. 6, 2015 that carried this headline: “Nancy Pelosi's vineyard makes her fourth-richest Californian in Congress”
            </p>
            <p>
             This is how the Times described the vineyard and its estate when Pelosi visits it:
            </p>
            <blockquote>
             <p>
              “It can be an odd thing having Nancy Pelosi as your next-door neighbor.
             </p>
             <p>
              “Especially when the House minority leader and her husband open up their bucolic Northern California estate and vineyard on the banks of the Napa River to the likes of Google’s Eric Schmidt, wealthy environmental activist Tom Steyer and Gov. Jerry Brown.
             </p>
             <p>
              “‘When all the black SUVs are circling around the property — like planes gathering over O'Hare Airport — that is when you know they are here,’ Susanna Kelham, who owns a winery next to the Pelosi property in St. Helena, told the Los Angeles Times.
             </p>
             <p>
              “That was the scene last year when Pelosi hosted a dinner at the couple's sprawling estate and vineyard about 65 miles north of Pelosi's San Francisco district to close out a two-day conference in the wine country for political heavyweights.”
             </p>

             This from the man who is involved with a dozen non-profit organizations and works with the eight police chiefs in the county and who has 78 people to be responsible for in the department. These include patrol deputies, jailors, dispatchers, detectives, and office and administration staff. His annual budget is 7.53 million dollars, which leads him to comment that they are in a “good financial position.”

             Excuse me, but that spelling is taken from a quote in another thread.  Some people sometimes misspell those things because they want to protect themselves from lawsuits.  Just like you may see this:  $pielberg   or $eorge $ush.  People know what those misspellings mean.  Just a heads up.

               Lucifer might rule the earth (it certainly seems like it at this point in time with all the disgusting things going on here) but God rules the universe.  Even in Gnosticism, the demiurge (the controller of the material world who is evil; I assume their demiurge is Lucifer) is subordinate to the supreme being.

                 Yes, and they are right on track with their plans.  They will eliminate all faith. I believe those with faith will be first ostracised (that is happening now); then marginalised (already that's beginning to happen); then punished, imprisoned and killed.  I abhor what some Catholic priests have done to children, but this plays right into their hands: to feed anger towards religion and faith. When they eliminate all faith, they will use that as an excuse and people will not fight back.   Those who have faith will have to practise in secret. If found out, we will be imprisoned or killed.  There will be no public places of worship.  We are on our way to end times.

                According to Noonan: "The three of them sat like old friends and discussed strategies and made treaties. Clintons crimes were to be set aside until his wife finished two terms of working with Republicans to shore up the base and move away from these Trump loving racists as Ryan put it. Lynch would seal the deal by not investigating the Clintons further. Ryan gets to remain Speaker, the Democrats get the Senate and the White House and 2024 is up for grabs. The pilot never got to tell his story on Fox News because he ended up dead even though under heavy guard. Just as some of us have expected. When will people learn that there are not 2 parties. They are all working together behind the curtain, against all of us. Paul Ryan is up to something with Rahm Emanuel which should all frighten us

                   They're all being paid. They are doing it for the money.  Honey Bee was poor before this began.  She and her partner were homeless for a while.  Her partner crowdfunded to make a movie about their plight.   She's now appears emotionally invested in 'saving children' only because she's so financially invested in it.  These people are pretty easy to pick:  ask them a simple question and notice their defensiveness.  They cannot answer directly. They are fearful of being exposed, and it shows.  Honey Bee has an army of protectors around her---just look at the way these mods surround her and attack anyone who asks her a question.  The mods here are paid too.

               Catholic Christians have always believed that Jesus Christ would come back to close the current period of human history in earth. The time when Jesus will return is given many names: the Day of the Lord, the Parousia, the end time, and the Second Coming of Christ.

                 Out of the third world war would emerge a new religious system . The third world war would have to be tailored to be like the Bible’s Armageddon, Satan told his highest slaves, because- if it resembled Armageddon, then the people would believe he was the Messiah when he came after its end . It would have to be terrible, so that he could step in and bring miraculous order out of a world beaten into chaos by the worst war in history. Again it would be "Order out of chaos", as the Masonic documents repeatedly proclaim.

                 I have just recently found it again.  They are not fooling me with their talk of no devil.  We have had nothing but a March of Evil ever since 9-11 when a huge amount of Evil Loosh was released by the Satanists.  It's up to us to Create Good to counter act this stuff before The Parousia.  I knew what it was but now am getting convinced it will happen.  We just have to be ready.

                   Somehow it always has been that good triumphed over evil in the end.  Hopefully that will happen again.  They are fighting really hard this time.  They have tried this before.  Many different ways.  The Blessed Virgin and St. Michael are a Powerful Force when combined  This is what we need again.  They make a very good team.

                   "They" are in for the shock of their lives.  I am already heading towards being liberated from their evil.  I am getting closer to accepting the eternal life and mortal being beliefs.  I no longer am afraid of death when the time comes.  The whole realization that they want to kill my faith and all Christianity as woken me totally.  They have only strengthened my faith.

                  Carmen, I think it's already written. Yes, all we can do is be ready and make sure we are on the right side, albeit on the losing side for now.  In the end, God wins.

                   I can't imagine these evil satanists actually believe the devil will win.  I plan on being on the right side.  Most on voat are.  We must wake the others so we have a bigger army.  Not a bullet army but any army to stand them down.  To show our strength.

                    I think to understand Luciferianism, you have to understand Gnosticism. They view Lucifer as the saviour from the evil overlord God, who is keeping us imprisoned on this material world.  Lucifer, the light bearer, the bringer of knowledge, (in their minds) wants to free us from the lies and deception of the creator God.  The creator God created us for his entertainment, keeping from us the knowledge that we have his spirit and ultimately his abilities.
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    Gnostics say that the truth can be entrusted only to those at the top end of the totem pole: the illuminates.  The rest of us are too stupid to understand.  They think they are doing us a favour by bringing Lucifer to power.
                   </p>

                    The bible (they believe) is written in parables/code and there is an esoteric meaning to everything in it.

                    The Templar Knights were ostensibly created to protect pilgrims, but they spent seven years engaging with rabbinic scholars and digging at the site of the Temple of Solomon.  Whatever they found and learned formed their beliefs. They worshipped a head with white hair and a long beard which they called 'Baphomet'. This head would speak to them, giving them advice on how to plant crops and how to increase their wealth.  They disbanded when the King of France found out about their 'initiation rites' eg kissing, navel, nape of neck and backside; instructing initiates that they were to make themselves available for sex at all times by seniors; forced to share beds. Their secrets travelled to the UK where they reappeared as the freemasons.
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    Gnostics are at the head of governments, religion and all of our societies.  Luciferians run the world.

               Somebody had to. Name calling each other gets us nowhere.   Some just aren't on here enough or aren't privy to everything we are.  But he did get me to research that missing girl Jayme and that Sheriff and LE imo are involved.  Highly Suspect.

             We are the reason Q exists.

             We are the reason why Paul Ryan and many others have resigned.

            <p>
             We are the reason Q stopped posting on public 8chan boards.

            <p>
             We are the reason Q flooded Voat.

             We are the reason Trump closed The Deal to the public.

            <p>
             Trump endorsed The Mark of the Beast and the Real Agenda is more sinister than anyone can comprehend.

               Racine, WI is the ROOT of All Evil and the Model to the Real Agenda beyond 21 / 2030 of Eternal Enslavement forged through the Great Deception of Sustainability (Satan's Ability) with The Mark of the Beast enforced by 5G+ AI and Community Policing.

                The weak link to the entire chain of command is Rothschilds &gt; Rockefellers &gt; Johnsons. They have unlimited resources and layers of protection, control and contingencies.

              <p>
               There is a vast network of interwoven Corrupt Corporations, Governments, NGOs, Foundations, False Religions, Service Clubs and Secret Societies. Art, music, movies, technology and False Prophets all play key roles in the real Agenda as they Deceive The World right in front of Everyone as they implement their plan. The layers go far beyond the Pilgrims Society, Sphinx Head Society, Club of Rome, Knights of Pythias, Knights of Malta, Royal Order of Jesters, Committee of 300, Majestic 12, and Council of 13 to national, regional, state and local groups, clubs and lodges. There is a system of control that most never see.
              </p>
              <p>
               The network of Global Criminal Corruption is too big to fail, and those involved at the top levels can never be held accountable and are beyond the reach of any law of the corrupt and dysfunctional systems they control.

               Donald Trump is never going to Drain any Swamp. He is one of them. He is friends with them. He is the Trump card to divide and conquer. He is a Freemason and a member of the Pilgrims Society. Trump made The Deal to endorse The Mark of the Beast and turned his back on The Truth. We are The Witness.
              </p>
              <p>
               We are the reason Q exists. We are the reason why Q flooded Voat. We are the reason so many have resigned. They will stop at Nothing to Eliminate The Truth and continue the Fake Fights and False Flags as they cover up and fortify their Corruption.
              </p>
              <p>
               Water, Energy and Knowledge are the keys to controlling society. The real Agenda is much more sinister than anyone can comprehend. Voat and other platforms are compromised. They must Silence The Truth before The World Knows.

                EXPOSING THE ROOT OF ALL EVIL AND SHARING THE TRUTH IS THE ONLY WAY.

                I agree with you. I initially thought that Trump was anti-establishment, but he's just another creature from the swamp.
               </p>
               <p>
                The Rothschilds at the moment have the world economy by the throat.  They will kill anyone who  gets in their way. They will fund guerrilla warfare, murder democratically elected leaders and take down whole countries.  We are like flies to them--they simply have to swat us to get us out of the way.
               </p>
               <p>
                Gaddafi was murdered because he put his country's national interests first.  He was a threat to the Rothschilds. Gaddafi wanted to make the gold dinar the primary means of payment for oil. At the moment, the Rothschilds make trillions from oil in the Middle East because the US dollars is the means of payment. Gaddafi sought to divert those profits into state=controlled funds rather than giving it to the Rothschilds. This would have made Africa a rich country.
               </p>
               <p>
                Out of the blue, US-backed Libyan Islamists  who were in exile, created a central bank and an oil company while NATO (the puppet of the US) fought the Gaddafi government.  Never before had a central bank been created in a matter of weeks out of an uprising.  Who knew how to create a central bank?  London bankers, the Rothschilds, that's who. The Rothschilds wanted to destroy any idea of an African currency.
They killed Gaddafi because he was a nationalist who cared about his country.
               </p>
               <p>
                China and Russia will not stand for the bullying by the Rothschilds and their puppets, USA and the UK.  That's how I believe the third world war will start.  What gives me some comfort is the Bible's words: "... the meek will inherit the earth"

I don't see enough change.  I just don't.  I don't want to be naïve and think he is the angel....
we are the angels/answer.  only we can fix it but americans are dumb.....
