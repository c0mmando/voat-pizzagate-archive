            that email is so fucked up it goes to show point blank what they think of all americans and people in general. they wanted the media to keep us busy and out of their way so they may play but now, it worked against them and trump won over clinton because he was more a tv type. im not going to lie, i voted for trump, never would i believe it would come to voting for someone like him but when it comes down to it i'm not going to let that fucking satanist bitch get the last laugh thinking she fooled us all. dumb bitch can't even control her damn kuru symptoms. cannibal ass having cunt. my apologies for my language but i'm sure everyone else feels the same anger and just over all WHO THE FUCK CAN WE TRUST feeling.

             I voted for Jill but would have voted Trump just because I thought Hillary was going to win no matter what. I breathed a sigh of relief when Trump won even though I can't figure out what his deal really is. I am kind of worried my first impression was right and he was running to be back up and make sure to lose to Hillary but he failed lol. Then I was hoping he ran against her to keep her out because he knows about everything...unfortunately today I learned about this and now I'm scared he's with her

            This is is  mishmosh of unrelated stuff.   There's zero creepy bout that Bill Ivey emails to Podesta.  He seems dead on accurate regarding the performance skills of Trump and Clinton.
           </p>
           <p>
            You haven't shown a connection with Ivey and Jace Alexander.
           </p>
           <p>
            You then jump to the unrelated case of Brian Singer.   There's a ton of problems with this case.  For one his lawyer claimed he would be able to prove he was in Toronto and not Hawaii when the alleged assault occurred.  In fact, they claimed he was in preproduction on the first Xmen movie, if this was the case, there would be a lot of documentation on this.  His accuser is not terribly trustworthy.
            <a href="http://variety.com/2015/biz/news/bryan-singer-michael-egan-sex-abuse-1201656874/">
             His accuser has since been convicted of fraud
            </a>
            in an unrelated case
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             Michael Egan, Bryan Singer’s Accuser, Sentenced to Two Years in Prison for Investment Fraud
            </p>
            <p>
             Michael Egan — who last year accused Bryan Singer and other industry figures of sexual assault, only to withdraw the claims — was sentenced to two years in prison on Tuesday in connection with a fraudulent investment scheme.
            </p>
            <p>
             Egan, 33, pleaded guilty earlier this year to charges of conspiracy to commit securities and wire fraud. U.S. District Judge Robert J. Conrad in Charlotte also sentenced Egan to two years supervised release and ordered him to pay more than $300,000 in restitution to his victims.
            </p>
           </blockquote>
           <p>
            <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/jun/08/michael-egans-former-lawyers-say-sexual-abuse-allegations-were-false">
             His lawyers now admit that Egan made false accusations of sexual assault
            </a>
            and  million dollars in a related case.
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             Michael Egan's former lawyers say sexual abuse allegations were false
            </p>
            <p>
             Lawyers who represented Michael Egan III, an actor who has claimed that several prominent Hollywood figures sexually abused him as a teenager, have conceded that his allegations about two of the accused were fabricated. They have issued a formal apology and paid the men a seven-figure sum, according to the Los Angeles Times.
            </p>
            <p>
             Mark Gallagher and Jeffrey Herman represented Egan in lawsuits filed against former Disney executive David Neuman and TV producer Garth Ancier in April 2014.

             “I believe that I participated in making what I now know to be untrue and provably false allegations against you,” Herman wrote in a letter to Neuman and Ancier last week. “Had I known what I learned after filing the lawsuits, I would never have filed these claims against you. I deeply regret the pain, suffering and damages the lawsuits and publicity have caused you, and your family, friends and colleagues.”
            </p>

             Egan also filed a suit against theatre producer Gary Wayne Goddard, which he subsequently dropped, and film director Bryan Singer. Egan’s claim against Singer, who has directed X-Men, X-Men 2 and The Usual Suspects, stands. Herman dropped Egan as a client last July, reportedly after his client refused to agree to a settlement of $100,000.

            It's so fucked that these people get probation and such BS sentences when regular people (rightly) get locked away pretty much permanently for a lot less CP.  They should be sentenced like everyone else, the sick fucks.
           </p>
           <p>
            I say this to normies who thinks that upper class people don't do this crap. They do, they just never get sentenced appropriately and it is very low key publicized.
