<p>Synopsis:</p>
<p>On June 22nd, Sarah Huckabee Sanders and 7 family members attended The Red Hen Restaurant In Lexington, Virginia. Before receiving service, the wait staff conspired to have the owner Stephanie Wilkinson show up and ask Sarah and her party to leave. They left politely and gracefully went across the street to another restaurant to dine but were followed by Stephanie, her employees and possibly other individuals were called.</p>
<p>Not sure who prompted the search into pizza related crimes. My first instance was a google search producing &quot;The Little Red Hen&quot; children\'s story accompanied by pizza related imagery. More Going On There. Next Day, Martin Brodel on Youtube was sent a link showing a reference made by a former employee &quot;Kevin Gardner&quot; stating that &quot;Allen Frazier&quot; is a registered sex offender who assaulted a toddler and was also part owner of The Red Hen Restaurant in lexington. Reports on Facebook &amp; Twitter simultaneously provided Instagram images showing a known pedophile symbol on Stepanie\'s Necklace as well as the offender\'s name &quot;Allen Frazier&quot; &amp; record from HomeFacts. Other photos showed Stephanie and her family wearing pinks hats protesting.</p>
<p>Several owners can be found to be tied to the restaurant. Still verifying Allen Frazier\'s association. Natkin- Bernard J. Attorney, apparently uses the restaurant as an office. VA business registry lists Wilkinson as primary owner and The Red Hen Restaurant states 4 owners.Ongoing</p>

<p>The Red Hen Restaurant - Business Registration/Owner Research</p>
<p>Yes, VA business registry lists only Wilkinson as owner: <a href="https://sccefile.scc.virginia.gov/Business/S254257">https://sccefile.scc.virginia.gov/Business/S254257</a></p>
<p>But having only one owner listed is not evidence of sole proprietorship, however. Case in point, this is Stephanie Wilkinson\'s other business. Again, only one owner listed: <a href="https://sccefile.scc.virginia.gov/Business/S689257">https://sccefile.scc.virginia.gov/Business/S689257</a></p>
<p>The company website, however, states that there are 4 owners: <a href="https://www.housemountainyarnco.com/about-us">https://www.housemountainyarnco.com/about-us</a></p>
<p>So Frazier\'s absence from the registry doesn\'t prove he\'s uninvolved with Red Hen. That said, we don\'t have evidence of his involvement, either.</p>

<p>Family Ties</p>
<p>It turns out that Stephanie Wilkinson very probably is Meryl Streep\'s cousin.</p>
<p>Meryl Streep\'s mom’s maiden name was Mary Wolf Wilkinson. (Interestingly, Mary\'s father was Harry &quot;Rockafellow&quot; Wilkinson.): <a href="https://www.geni.com/people/Mary-Streep/6000000008178222270">https://www.geni.com/people/Mary-Streep/6000000008178222270</a></p>
<p>Mary Wolf Wilkinson had a brother, David Pries Wilkinson, born in about 1924. (Note their father is now listed as Harry &quot;Rockefeller&quot; Wilkinson.): <a href="https://www.ancestry.com/1940-census/usa/New-Jersey/David-Preis-Wilkinson_4l9rl2">https://www.ancestry.com/1940-census/usa/New-Jersey/David-Preis-Wilkinson_4l9rl2</a></p>
<p>Stephanie Wilkinson has a possible relative David P. Wilkinson (scroll down): <a href="https://www.truepeoplesearch.com/results?name=Stephanie%20Wilkinson&amp;citystatezip=Lexington%2C%20VA&amp;rid=0x0">https://www.truepeoplesearch.com/results?name=Stephanie%20Wilkinson&amp;citystatezip=Lexington%2C%20VA&amp;rid=0x0</a></p>
<p>David P. Wilkinson, deceased in 2008 at age 83 and thus born in 1924-25, had a possible relative Stephanie Wilkinson and addresses in New York and Lexington, VA (scroll down): <a href="https://www.truepeoplesearch.com/results?name=David%20P%20Wilkinson&amp;personid=px2unu8620n602966lu66&amp;rid=0x0">https://www.truepeoplesearch.com/results?name=David%20P%20Wilkinson&amp;personid=px2unu8620n602966lu66&amp;rid=0x0</a> </p>

<p>If David Pries Wilkinson was Stephanie’s dad, Meryl Streep would be her cousin.</p>

<p>Stephanie Wilkinson Publications</p>
<p>Red Hen owner Stephanie Wilkinson used to publish a magazine called &quot;Brain, Child: The Magazine for Thinking Mothers.&quot; Some of the old articles are still available online: <a href="https://www.brainchildmag.com/">https://www.brainchildmag.com/</a></p>
<p><a href="https://archive.fo/IvnUB">https://archive.fo/IvnUB</a></p>
<p>This article in the NY Times tells about the end of the mag and some of the essays they had published, including these that have since been deleted, written by:</p>
<p>Moms who liked their breast pumps more than they liked nursing their babies.</p>
<p>One woman who was arrested after dropping her kids off at the mall, including one young enough to still be in a stroller, and going home to take a nap.</p>

           The Red Hen Restaurant - Business Registration/Owner Research
          </p>
          <p>
           Yes, VA business registry lists only Wilkinson as owner:
           <a href="https://sccefile.scc.virginia.gov/Business/S254257">
            https://sccefile.scc.virginia.gov/Business/S254257
           </a>
          </p>
          <p>
           But having only one owner listed is not evidence of sole proprietorship, however. Case in point, this is Stephanie Wilkinson's other business. Again, only one owner listed:
           <a href="https://sccefile.scc.virginia.gov/Business/S689257">
            https://sccefile.scc.virginia.gov/Business/S689257
           </a>
          </p>
          <p>
           The company website, however, states that there are 4 owners:
           <a href="https://www.housemountainyarnco.com/about-us">
            https://www.housemountainyarnco.com/about-us
           </a>
          </p>
          <p>
           So Frazier's absence from the registry doesn't prove he's uninvolved with Red Hen. That said, we don't have evidence of his involvement, either.

           It turns out that Stephanie Wilkinson very probably is Meryl Streep's cousin.
          </p>
          <p>
           Meryl Streep's mom’s maiden name was Mary Wolf Wilkinson. (Interestingly, Mary's father was Harry "Rockafellow" Wilkinson.):

           </a>
          </p>
          <p>
           Mary Wolf Wilkinson had a brother, David Pries Wilkinson, born in about 1924. (Note their father is now listed as Harry "Rockefeller" Wilkinson.):

           Stephanie Wilkinson has a possible relative David P. Wilkinson (scroll down):

           David P. Wilkinson, deceased in 2008 at age 83 and thus born in 1924-25, had a possible relative Stephanie Wilkinson and addresses in New York and Lexington, VA (scroll down):

           Stephanie Wilkinson Publications
          </p>
          <p>
           Red Hen owner Stephanie Wilkinson used to publish a magazine called "Brain, Child: The Magazine for Thinking Mothers." Some of the old articles are still available online:

           This article in the NY Times tells about the end of the mag and some of the essays they had published, including these that have since been deleted, written by:

          <p>
           Moms who liked their breast pumps more than they liked nursing their babies.
          </p>
          <p>
           One woman who was arrested after dropping her kids off at the mall, including one young enough to still be in a stroller, and going home to take a nap.

            Maybe she knew and she just wanted to check it out and see how bad they would sperg out. But all these front businesses aren't even really ready to sell food a lot of the time, lots of bad reviews on yelp about comet, goat hill, pizza girl all are fronts for human trafficking, same with voodoo donuts for that matter.

            Where is the proof that this Kevin Gardner character is legit? Do we have any proof of Alan Frazier being a silent partner in the business? I see screen shots of a post that someone who supposedly used to work there claims this toddler rapist was a silent partner in the business. Is this all the proof the pizzagate investigators need now? Yikes...

            Why is this 24 hour grace? This is extremely pizzagate related. We have a silent partner of a restaurant who is a registered sex offender. This IS pizzagate, and this is a good red pill to throw at normies: Sex offenders often become entrepreneurs because they are unhireable, This not only gives them access to cash, but better access to the community, and there are government programs to give them capitol to start.

            It turns out that Stephanie Wilkinson very probably is Meryl Streep's cousin.
           </p>
           <p>
            Meryl Streep's mom’s maiden name was Mary Wolf Wilkinson.  (Interestingly, Meryl's grandfather was Harry "Rockafellow" Wilkinson.):

             https://www.geni.com/people/Mary-Streep/6000000008178222270
            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            Mary Wolf Wilkinson had a brother,  David Pries Wilkinson, born in about 1924:

            Stephanie Wilkinson has a possible relative David P. Wilkinson (scroll down):

            David P. Wilkinson, deceased in 2008 at age 83 and thus born in 1924-25, had a possible relative Stephanie Wilkinson and addresses in New York and Lexington, VA (scroll down):

              I did see that, but I hadn't scrolled through the other slides. Thanks for pinging me because I did scroll this time, and:

              Thanks for the ping. These people can't hide anymore. The light is seeping in everywhere to reveal these cockroaches. I saw on a YELP review that someone posted a link to their sidewalk or lobby chalkboard that had a quote from Julia Child about food and love. I find it interesting that of all the famous chefs, they chose an undercover CIA asset. Sorry I don't have a link for it, but it comes up in google images if you search Red Hen.

            Red Hen owner Stephanie Wilkinson used to publish a magazine called "Brain, Child:  The Magazine for Thinking Mothers."  Some of the old articles are still available online:

            Moms who liked their breast pumps more than they liked nursing their babies.
           </p>
           <p>
            One woman who was arrested after dropping her kids off at the mall, including one young enough to still be in a stroller, and going home to take a nap.

            , can you edit post to summarize the information that has been uncovered? You haven't included enough information in the post to satisfy our submission requirements. You need a brief summary about why you think this is directly related to elite child rape...i.e. more info on the relationships of the owner and her pedo business partner.  The tweet you linked is no longer there, and the video you linked to is just a guy reading twitter. Your post needs some of the primary source links that have been added by
            <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/user/factfinder2">
             @factfinder2
            </a>
            in the comments here and by others to the twitter thread(s). Have we got confirmation she is Meryl Streep's cousin as they were claiming in the twitter replies? That would definitely connect it to the elite.
           </p>
           <p>
            I will give you the 24 Hour Grace flair so you can add this information to your post so we don't have to remove per Rules 1 and 2. Thanks.

              Unfortunately, titles cannot be edited. However, you can add a subhead to the top of the body of the text correcting the headline. Just click the edit button, and add  a "#" directly in front of the text line you want headline formatted, with no space before or after it, and click save.

             That's the wrong red hen restaurant.  So much for the 666.  The restaurant in question is in Lexington VA. Just goes to show you can see suspicious shit everywhere if you want to.

               Pointing out that the OP is referencing the wrong restaurant is hardly distracting from the "important point" he made.  Pointing out the 666 he sees in the restaurant's logo is not gaslighting since he has the wrong place.  Go fuck yourself.

              Yes, it's not the one in Lexington, but it's in DC, which makes the 666 even more important. Plus, BOTH restaurants seem to have interest in paying tribute to Rome. As most Pizzagate researchers know, all roads lead to Rome.
