<p>What of Hillary/Obama not only funded and armed the rebels in Benghazi. What if she set it up because Ambassador Stevens was going to speak up about what he knew? </p>
<p>What if there was an &gt;AIC&lt;  annex 1 mile from the Benghazi Compound? What if there were 15-25 &quot;Highly Trained&quot; and &quot;Very Well Armed&quot; agents 1 mile from Benghazi? What if Hillary told 2 SEAL Teams to stand down and why? What if Hillary and Obama used the &gt;AIC&lt; as a proxy to fund the rebels and create instability in the middle east? What if Hillary was involved in arms, drug &amp; child trafficking and Ambassador (Patriot) Stevens was going to reveal ALL of these things?</p>

<p>95 pages of monitoring and controlling the MSM over the Senate Benghazi Hearing. By the time you get to the end you will understand. And also will also understand the &quot;Copy/Pasted&quot; mainstream media aside from Fox (Which was only covered twice) is a fucking joke!</p>

<p>Ambassador Chris Stevens was going to leak all of it </p>
<p>&quot;Wikileaks is about to confirm the story that The Common Sense Show told 4 years ago  in that Ambassador Stevens was set up to die because his stories of gun-running, child trafficking and drug-running on behalf of the CIA in order to promote regime change in Libya using terrorists funded by these illegal activities,  were leaking out and it was only a few months until the election. Subsequently, Ambassador Stevens had to be silenced.&quot; (Copied from the usatoday news article posted above)</p>

            The whole Benghazi hearing was a joke. They covered up so much. The fact that Amb. Stevens requested help 600 times only came out because one Congress person was disgusted with one of Hillary's answers. What else did they hide from us. I sure had a lot of questions to ask her. Where's the footage from that night? Why wasn't she watching it? Why did it take FBI over a month to arrive at the scene, but CNN went in much earlier and found Stevens diary (or log book). What happened to Stevens book? Why didn't we send help that night? Where was Obama that night? Was anyone talking to the President before the decision not to send help was made. What was Petraeus doing? Was he involved with the orders that night, since it was the CIA Annex involved? Etc., etc. etc.

             That's what im saying, and I have proof. (Wikileaks, that people I guess haven't seen yet) But im NOT going to start a war. And this shit...WILL start a war. It's PG related to an extent but much more broader than just pedo satanism and human trafficking. Im talking about a proxy war(s) to displace elections to make other countries reliant on us. They used the Middle East and N. Africa destabilization as a way to create chaos in other countries to make them dependent on our presence, money and weapons. Including our own allies....

               one
              </em>
              of "High Level Analyst" leads to completion.....and what I learned makes me fucking sick to my stomach. The pedo sadistic part is marshmallows compared to the "Endgame".

             They wanted to initiate "WW3" or literally "Armageddon" then blame Russia, Iran, and China and then go hide in underground bunkers while most of us (+80%).....die. This has been set up for a very long time. It's the way they wanted to thin the population out....were too hard to control or rule right now, there's too many of us for them to control. In short....I understand "Why" Comey couldn't indict....it would literally start war. I also understand why the rest of Hillary's emails haven't/can't been released.....it would start a war. And this goes way further back than just Hillary/Obama. Were talking....the beginning of DC. And has /roots/ back to the pre-cannanite days.

              The book is excellent. The movie follows the book. It was written with the help of the men who were the heroes that night.

             Man I sure tell you what. You really can read "95 Pages" of corroborating documents that you watch like a hawk and never saw pretty quick. It took me 8 hours. You'd figure a person who "Watches something like a hawk"  that got a link to docs they
             <em>
              haven't read yet
             </em>
             would read the docs before posting an opinion.

               very informative bc had never heard about it before/but what you say made sense bc the Libyans took to the streets carrying candles and signs after he was murdered saying they loved Stephens bc he loved the Libyans and he came to help them.  Much different than the spin of Stephens was there to do arms sales but didn't know about Sarin which is what Webb says, arms not sarin.  What if Stephens was going to blow the cover on all of it?  From what I've read about him/he was a very decent man.  And it was the Libyans that rescued him.

                You are confusing. Are you in agreement or are you in dispute? You just called Webb of all people.....fake. But you agree with the info I posted. I don't understand. Steven's WAS killed because he was against it. And everything you said about him is true. (The Libyans liking him, and the spin the media put on it) The media portion is included in the wikileaks post I put up. They OWN the media. And you will see just how much of it, if you read the wikileaks article I posted. All media aside from Fox, tv wise. And like 80% of the written media as well. WSJ, NYT, WaPo, etc;

                 Webb says Stevens knew about the arms and was okay with that but he thinks Stevens didn't know about the sarin and was possibly going to expose that/reason he was off'ed.  It didn't make sense that Stevens knew about the arms when there was such an outpouring of love for him from the Libyans.  Your post clarified that for me bc I really didn't know what to make of it all/dots didn't connect.  Everything I've read about Stevens is he was a fine and honest man.  I had trouble reconciling that with he was okay with arms dealing.  Now if disinfo wants to control the narrative, and I'm just poking around, discussed it with a friend after reading your post, what better way to control the narrative than to link Stevens with arms dealing (not good) but not with sarin/a bait and switch sorta thing.

                  It wasn't just the Sarin, it was the child trafficking and drug trafficking as well. "Arms" will unfortunate always be a part of the way all govt's work. I can be passive to an extent on the aspect of small arms, because 90% of govt's do the same shit. China, Russia, India, The Philippians, Europe, Then ENTIRE Middle East, Africa, Mexico and S. America. Try to factor that in on the decision making part about if Steven's was a good man. Sometimes it's hard to understand that this is reality or accept it. I personally think Steven's was another Snowden after reading everything I've read. Even Snowden started out all in, but then after seeing the inner beast....had a change of heart.

                   You know, that's another good point.  He may have been okay with the arms thing.  Like you say, it's an unfortunate part of this war like reality.  Question is how much did he know/was he told we have to get these arms out of here bc it will look bad for us but leave out the part we are going to give them to isis to slaughter innocent civilians in Syria?  Or maybe he even took the kool aid that Syria had an evil dictator and we needed to save the Syrian ppl...that is a distinct possibility bc so many did/and still do believe that narrative.

                     Right, excellent points and it all makes sense.  I'm so used to not withholding information (sometimes my friends wish I would shut up I think...did you hear about pizza gate, did you hear about Moloch, the Vatican etc) I forget the rule of thumb in that arena is need to know only.

                XD maybe you should've read the links 1st there sport. Btw after all of your friends are laid down....."Paid Shills" most likely WILL be brought up on treason and conspiracy. So I mean yeah.....your kinda fucked. Enjoy your last little bit of freedom. You and faggots like yourself will NOT interfere in the investigation. "My Truth" will always beat "Your bullshit". It's why you failed in the election, and why you fail now. It's why you fail so fucking always! Your side....NEVER learns. The walls are already starting to tumble down around you.

                 Okay, took a minute to figure out what you are upset about.  To be clear/I was not saying you are disinfo/my comment was in relation to Webb only.  Yes, I do have an issue with Webb, have said so repeatedly if you ck comment history and I do feel like I was taken in by his gosh friendly persona.  It is simply misinterpretation that you thought I referred to you as disinfo and I'm sorry I didn't make this clearer.  Might want to look at my comment again
                 <strong>
                  in context
                 </strong>
                 .  Repeat...the disinfo comment
                 <strong>
                  was not about you
                 </strong>
                 .  The irony is I agree with what you are posting/with the exception of Webb. I still learned something from your post so thank you.

                   Gosh do I lol.  Honestly until I started following the election I had no idea what CRT was or any of it. Yes, I knew propaganda has existed and that the CIA and others made a point of doing such but the extent to what I now see was mind boggling.  I see them constantly in the donald reddit/acting so concerned which is another aspect of trolling I was completely unaware of.  Then of course the more blatant trolls just spouting profanities.  I had no idea the hundreds of thousands in funding either.  Probably one of the reasons I'm so upset about Webb is I believed in him for quite awhile/told all my friends to ck him out.  And to be clear I did learn a lot about how the process goes for taking down a country.  But then he started saying things here and there that made me go 'huh'.  We had a discussion about him a month ago here wondering is he disinfo or just kinda dense at times.  Bc I have a tendancy to believe the best of ppl I wrote some of his obvious disinfo as he was being dense/so did my friend.  However things kept mounting to the point we went nah, disinfo.  I'm really more upset with myself for not viewing him objectively and trying to make him into a 'good guy' when I now believe he's not.
                   <br/>
                   Of course you have your opinion of him.  The beauty of discussion is we can agree to disagree and still expand our knowledge.
I'm giving an upvote for your post bc it really clarified for me what I 'felt' about Stevens in my gut.  And now to know there was a team that could have rescued him only a mile away/all the terror he and the others were going thru.  I had read about how the embassy security team was literally picked up off the streets with known isis and how he begged for better security.  He considered HC a friend, he was loyal to her and she not only had him killed but in a horrific manner that I can't even imagine the terror he felt.
One of the red flags I first picked up from Webb was his suggestion that we just let HC off the hook, let bygones be bygones, the important thing was to stop the trafficking.  I was like are you fucking serious?  She has others tortured for her sadistic pleasure/I do believe she is a psychopath.  He also likes Bill (minus the rape issue he says) and bama.  Again, how can you like someone/divorce them from the reign of terror, murder, rape, pillage that they inflict on hundreds of thousands.
I followed Libya from the begining and I almost lost my sanity.  I cried more than I care to remember.  It truly broke my heart.  What that country was so beautiful.  Kaddiffi struck a deal with Berlusconi to stop the human trafficking via Benghazi/which didn't sit well with the Benghazi mafia.  When the invasion of Libya began it had three first steps...

                   empty out the orphanage and the kids were never to be seen again (160 plus).  Ppl tried for months to find them.  Possibly a few pictures from the French underground child sex trade/that was it.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   I had no idea how big the network till last winter with the exposing of the clinton foundation.  I didn't know anything about Haiti.  So it's been one red pill after another as to how huge this all is. 
We had a very detailed and informative discussion from Webb 117 day two/covered all aspects of the satanic roots/bc Webb says the satanic part is just a psyop.  I said is and isn't...yes a psyop to distract from organ harvesting but not a psyop bc it existed before organ transplanting was ever even a dream/goes back centuries.  So many made very informed comments.  Webb deleted the whole tube/said it had weird comments.  Yet the commentaries were so reasoned, thought out, much back and forth/no name calling or any of that just inquiring minds.  Several who were not sure about the satanic aspects started questioning/which is always good instead of taking someone's word for it.  Some would say well it muddies the research but how can you separate that aspect from the picture as a whole?  It is part of the very root of the evil.  It goes so far beyond just taking organs/least ways to my eyes.  With organ harvesting you kill the person and take the organs.  With the other you thrive on torture.  How can that be a non issue?

             If I'm not mistaken, GW has implied or even outright said that he thinks Chris Stevens could have been involved in smuggling stingers and sarin gas into Syria.
            </p>
            <p>
             Not necessarily that he knew the intended end use, but I would be hesitant to call him a "good guy" without a better investigation.

              He was already speaking out about it. It's in the wikileaks link. The article covers it in a small bit as well. Ambassador Stevens was CIA, and he was being too opinionated about they were doing. "They kill their own" it's how they deal with internal conflicts. But nonetheless he was speaking out about what was happening. He's still a patriot in my eyes, not everyone who sign up for CIA understand what their position will actually be. In they're world....the left hand never lets the right hand know what it's doing. And I believe Ambassador Stevens was against it......and that's why they killed him.

              "GW worked for CIA"......I think so as well. It's not confirmed though and is just a theory.

               If you listen to Webb long enough, objectively, you'll see the disinfo.  I'm not going to break it down/it's been discussed at length.Even yesterday he inferred Laura Silsby was sitting next to Trump at Trump's trafficking presser.  He was called out on it in comments.  He's more the soft dropping disinfo like Pieczenik.  Steele does it like a smoke bomb lol.
