This occurred to me. If this information is investigated in an official capacity, is brought out into the open, and actions taken. What effect would it have on the individuals and nations with gold holdings? Just as there is little interest in truly protecting the species that naturally produce ivory (since their extinction would make the price rise exponentially for those who view it as a comoddity). Is there an interest of some who wish to see the industry involved in mining one of the oldest forms of money brought to it\'s knees? If we returned to a gold standard who would benefit? It would mean an end to the institutions that profit from practices based around the trading of fiat currency, high frequency trading etc. and this is potentially a very good thing. Is it is possibly why some are fighting back or cooperating with measures against movements of the gold stuff as seen in India <a href="http://www.thedailybell.com/news-analysis/india-bans-cash-now-gold/">http://www.thedailybell.com/news-analysis/india-bans-cash-now-gold/</a> and the EU <a href="http://mobile.reuters.com/article/idUSKBN14A16N">http://mobile.reuters.com/article/idUSKBN14A16N</a> ?
This is why it interests me, because there is such an effort to hush this shit up. Yes they don\'t want to be outed as the sick, satanic paedofile fucks they are, but there will always be fall guys and if necessary they will let them fall. But if I\'m right, this goes directly to the heart of their bullshit financial system which relies on a &quot;currency&quot; that\'s value is only based on our belief it has a value....much like gold itself, but unlike gold, it can be managed/manipulated more easily because it isn\'t FINITE.
I realise I\'m going waaay ahead of the game at hand, but feel webofslime is onto something that goes right to the heart of the beast. But again, if I am right, we still need to question who ultimately benefits? If the human race is to survive, then it is the potential to be independent of all material hierarchy that should be placed above all else, and that requires an open source attitude in my opinion (but that\'s just my own personal prejudice, and yeah, I know I\'m fucking rambling). Money in whatever form represents human potential and human potential relies on consciousness. Govern-control, Ment-mind.</p>',

            wanted to check out your other posts. this one is real good. I agree, but came at it from a different angle.  the fiat is the root cause of the evil. It allows whomever controls the fiat to control everyone. biblical prophecy, number of the beast.
