            I posted the entire story behind Aaron Rouse and MF deleted it three times. John Podesta's daughter is Megan Rouse married to an Aaron. Obama transition team was lead by John Podesta and Pete Rouse.

           <p>
            Dear Security Professional:
           </p>
           <p>
            In support of its Counterintelligence Strategic Partnership Program, the Federal Bureau of Investigation will join forces with the Florida Industrial Security Working Group (FISWG) to host a Spring 2012 Research and Technology Protection (RTP) Conference for Facility Security Officers, Computer Security and RTP Professionals.  Your facility, along with other Central Florida area Department of Defense Contractors and University Program Managers, are invited to attend this special event. Unclassified presentations will address counterintelligence issues, espionage, spy tradecraft, Cyber and Wi-Fi vulnerabilities, plus an inside look at the operations of an illegal Russian SVR spy network.
           </p>
           <p>
            The Conference is planned for Wednesday, April 25, 2012. Registration for visitor's badges will begin at 8:00 AM.  Conference will begin promptly at 8:30 AM and conclude circa 12:45 PM.  It will take place at LOCKHEED MARTIN, GLOBAL TRAINING &amp; LOGISTICS, 100 Global Innovation Circle, Orlando, Florida 32825.  A facility map is included with this letter.  In order to bypass the Visitor's Center and streamline the check-in process, please pass through the far left entrance lane where security personnel will check your identification and direct you to proceed to the main lobby (E-3 Lobby), where a representative will let you in the door.  At that time, you will receive your visitor's badge and check in for the conference.  There is Visitor Parking in Parking Lot 6 (facility map).
           </p>
           <p>
            This letter includes an agenda of the day's events.  Our guest speakers include Bill Kline, Director of the International Training Center (ITC), Fort Washington, MD, and Keith Melton, Consultant and Technical Tradecraft Historian, ITC.  Mr. Melton, renowned historian, author, professor and specialist in clandestine devices and espionage “tradecraft,” will be the featured presenter on “Ghost Stories” which was highlighted on CBS’ 60 Minutes.  The arrests of 10 Russian spies in 2010
           </p>
           <p>
            provided a chilling reminder that espionage on U.S. soil did not disappear when the Cold War ended.  The deep-cover Russian spies may not have achieved their objective, but they were not idle.  They collected information and transmitted it back to Russia, and they were actively engaged in what is known in the spy business as “spotting and assessing.”  The Russian illegals were arrested by the FBI on June 27, 2010.  Weeks later, they pled guilty in federal court to conspiring to serve as unlawful agents of the Russian Federation within the U.S.
           </p>
           <p>
            Please complete the attached RSVP form no later than April 16, 2012.  It is preferable that you e-mail your RSVP response to FISWG representative Stephen Abounader at

            , or send it via FAX: 407-356-0919.  Please RSVP as soon as possible as seating is limited to the first 120 responders.

            The FBI’s Counterintelligence (CI) Strategic Partnership Initiative is an outreach program which fosters communication and awareness with key public and private entities, by educating, and enabling our partners to identify what sensitive information and technology is at risk and how to protect it.  Your sensitive research, much of which occurs in the unclassified realm, is the key to our nation’s global advantage, both economically and militarily.  The information which will be discussed during the upcoming RTP Conference will enhance your understanding of the threat posed by foreign intelligence services and foreign competitors.  If you do not intend to participate in the RTP Conference, but wish to receive a CI threat briefing for yourself and your facility personnel, please contact Patrick Laflin at 813-253-1029,
