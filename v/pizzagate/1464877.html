            It's interesting that they always say "Hillary ran" the sex ring.    While it's certainly possible that Hillary runs trafficking and pedo rings, pizzagate researchers have been pretty good about keeping the focus on the Podestas and other people implicated.   Hillary may have used the rings for leverage and blackmail while never directly getting her hands dirty.   Or she may be one of the top figures in international child trafficking.   We don't know yet.
           </p>
           <p>
            Same with the idea of the sex ring "run out" of Comet.   While that's a possibility, it's also possible that nothing untoward has ever happened on the Comet premises, and that it's just one of the places these people network.
           </p>
           <p>
            They never mention WHY people became suspicious in the first place.   One article I saw mentioned "pizza related handkerchief map" and alleged codewords.   But they never mention James' instagram or Tony's art collection or the McCann angle or Kleinman's music videos or the crazy Bif Potato Head shit etc. etc.   It's very unusual, because you'd think if it was all so baseless they'd be eager to debunk the evidence.   Instead, it's almost like they've looked at the images and said, "shit, this doesn't look good at all, I better just dimiss it out of hand."
           </p>
           <p>
            Remember also, since this is Canada, that we're dealing with a transnational ruling class/power structure.   You shouldn't expect media in allied countries to responsibly report on the scandal.

             That's certainly something that irks me - I've never heard anybody reference the reasons why people are suspicious about this in the first place. Like you said, it's just an immediate dismissal.
