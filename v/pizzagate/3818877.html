<blockquote>
<p><strong>A former New Orleans Police Department detective who led the NOPD’s pedophile investigations unit for years</strong> before he was unmasked as a child molester himself admitted in federal court last month that he abused a boy who had turned to him for protection after the boy was preyed upon by his Boy Scout leader.</p>
<p><strong>Stanley Burkhardt</strong>’s admission in a Feb. 24 hearing in North Carolina came after years of denying the sex abuse claims leveled against him by Richard Windmann.</p>
<p>Windmann’s 1977 testimony, at age 12, that he was sexually assaulted by a scout leader helped prosecutors convict the leader of nearly 30 molestation charges.</p>
<p>Remarkably, Windmann has said he was a victim in three high-profile abuse scandals of the era, and with Burkhardt’s confession, there is evidence to back him up in each case. In addition to Burkhardt and the Boy Scout leader, Windmann has said he was abused repeatedly at Jesuit High School by a janitor and a priest, and he received a six-figure payment to settle that claim.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Someone in the comments asked the OP, &quot;Do you believe there was a pedophile ring operating in the area?&quot;</p>
<p>OP replies</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Yes, New Orleans Boy Scout troop 137 was a front for an international pedophile ring. Men would fly in from all over the US and other countries to rape the children. They would almost always take photos and videos. Stanley Burkhardt knew at least one of them, Kirk Roth.</p>
