            , thank you for your post. I will flair it 'NSFW' due to covering cannibalism.
           </p>
           <p>
            Do you have any info whether the perp might have been a member of the elites, or in any way connected to the elites?
           </p>
           <p>
            If so, please add the info. (You know....
            <em>

            How does someone even get to that point?  We know how pedophiles are created, but what turns them into cannibals?  Something must have happened to this person, and of course there have been others.  And also he wanted to turn this child into a Baby Making Machine.  So, sex trafficking, pedophilia, and cannibalism.  With a mind like that,  we can surely presume he had already committed at least one of these crimes. Hopefully they looked deeper into his past activities.  Just Sickening.

             It's like a drug addict. After a while, the drug they started off with isn't strong enough anymore, so they have to seek out a stronger drug to get higher. So one could start off as a pervert/Peeping Tom, then he rapes someone, then later he develops an "attraction" to children, then his pedo thoughts go from fantasy to reality, and when physically molesting kids has lost its edge, the offender is more likely to get into beastiality, satanism, and cannibalistic activities, as this will continue to give him the "high" that he's constantly chasing.

             That is a very important thing that all PG researchers need to keep in mind: The elite are all addicted to adrenochrome, and probably to a bunch of designer drugs as well. These people are all fragile and falling apart, both physically and mentally. So always remember that; even though we like to think of our enemy at this sharp-witted, always-at-the-ready kind of foe, the reality is that we are fighting against a bunch of child molesting drug addicts who like to join "super secret clubs" and LARP in druid robes.

              That is a pretty creepy bunch of weirdos you have painted there.  It reminds me of the post with Diane Feinstein in it yesterday.  She is the richest member of congress has been a lawmaker for decades and she looks like a zombie.  That is the only thing keeping them from falling apart in public, their programmed drugged up MK Ultra minds.  Plus their cravings for the next perverted level.

               Yeah the reason so many politicians are old and decrepit and look like the Crypt Keeper is because the years of psychological torment that has been inflicted on them, on top of the horrible things they've done to others, it all eventually manifests itself physically, in the form of making all of these people ugly as hell. It's almost like all of the horrible things they've done begin to bleed into their physical appearance.

                Yeah and Pelosi and Feinstein are perfect examples and McTurtle  GHWBush  looks the worst of all the men.  He has been the recipient of some of the worst and dished out some of the worst.  Another one that has gone under the radar somewhat is Barney Frank.  He provided a place for a lot of these politicians earlier on to have their "boy parties: decades ago.  These "Dinosaurs" need to go.  People need to get off their duffs and get out there and go door to door and fight to get them out of office.  Beware though, because a lot of these people are now saying they are not running, like Feinstein.  Be careful to notice who they are offering in return.  They are not who they profess to be.  Do your homework.  They will not let someone of high caliber to replace someone that has kept Greasing Their Wheels.

             I don't know what your religious beliefs are, but the Bible teaches that these types of people have been given over to a reprobate mind. They rejected God so much that he finally rejecrs them and they turn to full fledged depravity.

              I agree with this 100%. This is why I disagree when people say that "all people" can be saved by Jesus Christ. There comes a point where you are no longer redeemable. Podesta, Alefantis, all these fuckers, even if they dropped to their knees and prayed right now, God's not going to pity them or save them. Once you kill someone and eat their flesh, you've made your bed spiritually.

                This is why I disagree when people say that "all people" can be saved by Jesus Christ. There comes a point where you are no longer redeemable.

              <p>
               There's another way of looking at the paradox of depravity vs. Redemption, pedostomper. If God is blindingly Beautiful and Good, and all of a sinner's inner lies and psychological justifications are stripped away at death and he is faced with the full truth and evil of his actions on the one hand and the full Glory and majesty of God and the beloved child he has harmed on the other, he may very well CHOOSE eternal Hell to escape the burning reality of his own hideous crimes. The loving redemption of God, won by the horrific suffering and sacrifice of Christ, is no easy pill to swallow when the full reality of sin dawns in the mind. If you were a drunk bum who awoke suddenly aware and ashamed  from your life in the gutter, would you stand up and walk into a glorious wedding reception covered in vomit, feces and piss and just sit down to join the party?

              If that's the case, we are in for many more of these Evil Freaks.  This may be true, but I bet his upbringing may hold a clue as well.  People that are raised by well adjusted parents do not turn out to be cannibals and sex offenders.  Yes, someone helped put the evil in this guy's brain.  And he then angered Our Lord.

             It is the ultimate sin.  A spiritual way of making one's victims "part of them".  It's the pinnacle of individual evil.

                Know what you mean. I knew there was evil in this world, but that was the most disgusting thing I have ever read in my life. This cannibalism of a baby rates right up there with it. It is a battle of good verses evil.

             I so agree. And there's no doubt in my mind he's committed a crime before. You don't just do this at your first rodeo.

             The cannibalism really is a new wrinkle. It's trending among the sickos. I'm sure it was always underground--way under ground, but it's gotten mainstream. You did hear about the case of that police officer? Where the conviction of plotting to kill and eat his ex-wife was overturned by the judge? Only roleplaying was the reason given. I think these forums that are set up for LARP are encouraging the normalization and desire. It' like porno in a lot of ways.

              Well think about it, these Satanic pedo "elites" want for the entire world to think and live as they do, so that their sick activities will be viewed as perfectly normal and acceptable. They don't LIKE living in the shadows and hiding their true nature from the masses. They want a populous that is okay with the things that they do, and partake it in themselves. I imagine that the Rothschilds, among others, are extremely happy at how prevalent cannibalism is becoming in news and pop culture.

              If there is anything more sick than porn it is pedophilia and cannibalism.  They are both evil and vile.  Same letters.

               It's true. If someone wants to watch porn, it's their business/problem. It's just that it's not likely that a normal, well-adjusted person would become a porn star. Yes, they all say they were never abused, but anyone that knows anything knows it's not the truth. A lot of abuse goes on to create a prostitute and/or porn star.

                      Well, I think if they want to find it, they will, and visa versa.  We shall see if there is news to come. So many tech tools and many times their are dead ends.  Hmm.  I think some of them are sitting on Dead Ends.

                       I think the police already did prove themselves to be on the side of wanting to find this. The scumbag Bensing was from Myrtle Beach and there were a few undercover stings there. They might have been following leads which led to him.

                        Remember those SEIU guys that were slain gangland style?  The ones that died a day after Seth Rich?  They were from Myrtle Beach too.  That place has problems.

                         Oh, you're right! Well, Myrtle Beach has a huge tourist trade.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                         It seems that these human traffickers prefer places with a tourist trade. Makes kids/slaves easier to get in and out of and then there are the customers. They're only there for short periods of time. Think Bangkok.

                             Exactly. And the other thing is lots of kids used to go to those locations so it's even more reason not to notice the human trafficking.

                              You know it's sad but sometimes I believe La.  gets forgotten.  I think there are some really bad things going on down there.  Possibly like Haiti.  I just have a feeling, mainly because it is way low down there.  Ever since Katrina it is forgotten.  Even here it is hardly mentioned.
