<p>This thread relates to Pizzagate in the sense that this is another thread in the long line of exposing systemic industrial child abuse.

<p>Blind Item #1 - <strong>Alex Winter\'s Molester</strong></p>
<p>The guy Alex Winter was molested by was an evil man and suffered death as an evil man should. A man, who by all accounts molested and raped hundreds of boys throughout his life and was eventually killed by his adopted teenage son who he had molested and raped for years. Our actor is foreign born and was killed just shy of his 70th birthday. Foreign born and a multiple Tony Award winner who was nominated multiple more times. One of his wins was for arguably one of the more famous musicals ever on Broadway. One of his nominations was for a musical that was great on Broadway and absolute crap when they made it into a movie. He was in both. One final clue is our actor died in a different foreign country from where he was born.</p>

<p>George Rose wiki:</p>
<p>In 1984, he purchased a holiday home in Sosúa, Dominican Republic, where he spent much of his time between his performances. Rose was gay and had no immediate family or permanent partner. He reportedly longed to have an heir. Shortly after moving, he took in a 14-year-old boy whom he supported financially and to whom he planned to leave his estate. He adopted the boy in January 1988.[2]</p>
<p>On 5 May 1988, during a two-week hiatus from the national tour of Drood, Rose was tortured and beaten to death by his adopted son, the boy\'s biological father,[7] an uncle, and a friend of the father. The assailants tried to make the death look like a car accident, but soon confessed to killing Rose.[2] Though all four men were charged and spent time in prison, no trial was ever held, and eventually all were released.[1]</p>
<p>Rose is buried in an unmarked grave in a cemetery near his holiday home in Sosúa.</p>

<p>&quot;George Rose was something of a Broadway legend, especially for his work in revivals of &quot;The Devil\'s Disciple&quot; and &quot;My Fair Lady,&quot; for the famous Kevin Kline/Linda Ronstadt &quot;The Prates of Penzance,&quot; and for the original production of &quot;The Mystery of Edwin Drood.&quot; He won several Tony awards. He had a Manhattan apartment where he kept multiple exotic animals, like a lynx and 2 lion cubs.&quot;</p>

            I knew who George was. I used to attend a lot of live theater. He had stage presence. I had no idea he was taking advantage of 100's of underage boys. Bummer. For some reason, I still feel his death is horrible. He brought it on himself however.  Notice how the authorities gloss over how he was known to molest young boys? His friends never mention it. He seems to have been in DR for the sole purpose of being able to get away with that lifestyle. What else is a British Broadway star doing living in Dominican Republic?

            This thread also stands as proof stars as far back as the seventies have been purchasing properties and islands in the Carribean and the Bahamas, Haiti and the Dominican Republic and using them as pedophile playgrounds.

            The DR, an incredibly poor country, paid $25 million dollars into the CF.
           </p>
           <p>
            Senator Bob Menendez was recently on trial for taking bribes from Salomon Melgen. The investigation started because there was an allegation that Menendez was involved with an underage girl while in the DR. News articles attempted to discredit that reporting, but the DOJ said it had some corroborating information (Menendez was in the DR the same time the girl alleged, for example) - just not enough to prosecute on that specific allegation.
           </p>
           <p>
            What did Salomon Melgen's corruption involve? Controlling port security in all of the DR. Anything illegally shipped in or out at the DR's ports would have been under his and his company's control.
           </p>
           <p>
            Melgen was just as good friends with the Clintons and Terry McAuliffe. They routinely stayed at Melgen's home in Casa de Campo.
           </p>
           <p>
            One last bit - who owns Casa de Campo? The Fanjul Brothers, who engage in modern day slavery and child labor according to our DoL, but the Clintons (and Marco Rubio) still take major donations from them and have for years. I still need to see the doc that never got any distribution called "Sugar Babies" but that covers the
            <strong>

            </strong>
            corruption. There is also a CBC doc about the Fanjuls I believe.

            "Juan claimed he had been having a sexual relationship with Rose while living in his house for the past four years, and had become insanely jealous of another boy who hung out at the house and with whom he accused Rose of flirting. He said he planned the murder with his natural father, who enlisted the help of the other two. Juan lured Rose into going for a drive, passing a spot where the others were waiting, armed with a gun bought by Juan, who then left the scene. The father said he “sought revenge on the American Rose because of his homo­sexual activities, since he was hurting a lot of boys... in addition to mine, whom he had already prostituted since the age of 13 to satisfy his sexual desires.” As an after­thought, both also admitted to a fear that Juan was about to be disinherited."

            I'm very happy for Alex being able to deal with what happened to him and be able to become a successful adult in the industry, and to feel empowered enough to share his story. I'm also glad George died at the hands of the child he molested and his family

             it may not be legal justice, but it's justice for Juan.
