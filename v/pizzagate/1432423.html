Hey everyone! Glad to see the enthusiasm on Voat is still going strong! The subject of PizzaGate recently crossed my attention and I feel the increasing need to do something about it. I am currently a Senior in College in the state of California. I know, the &quot;liberal&quot; state. The state of the &quot;tolerant&quot; Left. Here you have a plethora of eco-hipsters and snobby yoga wives. The perfect sandbox for me to hone in my skills of persuasion. You see, when you are surrounded by individuals who care more about what Jay Z or snoop Dogg\'s next song is going to be, you can\'t help but feel a certain detachment from reality. Like you\'ve walked into an enormous theater show. Fake smiles and fake aspirations. When you have to surround yourself with these individuals, room with these individuals, get educated along with these individuals, you will start to feel suffocated and isolated. Fear not my internet junkies, the cure for this is simple. The cure for this is conversation.  
</p>
<p>When you can start up a dialogue, you are automatically removing yourself from isolation. You are in the open to attack, but you are also in the open to be judged. This is a double edged sword because if you try to start a dialogue unprepared, you will quickly lose the attention and trust of the individual you are trying to engage. It is increasingly important to not only do research into a subject, but to also present it in a manner that people can digest and not reject outright. One day my media Professor brought up something interesting, he said that in order to change the minds of people, you must first change their heart. This is very true, and explains the phenomena where people can deny raw evidence right in their face...it doesn\'t make them feel good. Now the question is, HOW do you make them feel comfortable enough, or at least curious enough to engage you in a conversation about the subject you intend to talk about. And this brings me to what I want to dedicate this post about. I want to create a quick tutorial on how you should engage others on the subject of PizzaGate. It is a hard pill to swallow and one needs to be prepared to help others.  
</p>
<p>Too often have many of us approached our friends, family, and neighbors and have been rejected as loons for even attempting to discuss the topic of PizzaGate. I have far too much experience this week as I tried to convince dozens of my dorm mates to look into this controversy. I made progress with few, the majority possessed the attention span of a gnat. I have had several arguments alone in the past day about bringing up this subject and even called a Pedo myself by others who simply do not want to understand what I am showing them. One thing became clear, however, forcing an individual to engage you in this conversation will never change their mind. Remember this, forcing the conversation, whether you\'re hanging out with friends or at Thanksgiving dinner, is not a good idea.  It will immediately repel the skeptics away and severely lower your chances of engaging with people who simply know nothing. In the worst case skeptics will begin to actively lie to others around you to discredit you indirectly. By the end of this week, It was apparent to me that I needed to make a guide on how to engage the misinformed on the subject of PizzaGate. I\'v decided to create a simple step by step guide on how to casually engage people in the conversation of PizzaGate (without sounding like a loon). Many of you have already formulated these steps in your mind, but have not put pen to paper.  A solid guide will definitely boost your chances at changing the hearts of those you engage.<br />
How many times have you tried to talk about PizzaGate and the first thing your correspondent does is get hooked up on the name of the subject. You will be surprised how many people my age do not know about Watergate. They simply will not get the reference. You get answers like &quot;What? A gate made of Pizza?&quot; &quot;Peisagay?&quot;. This is the first roadblock that I usually meet when engaging others on this subject. The uninformed WILL get stuck on shallow details like the name of the subject for they know nothing of the actual content yet. The key is to avoid mentioning the name when you first start to engage your target. Find something else to catch their attention first before engaging them in PizzaGate directly.  
</p>
<p>Remember how I mentioned earlier that the only way to change the mind of people is through their hearts? This is very important to focus on at first. Once you have gained the curiosity of their hearts, then do you gain the passageway to their minds (where you can use all the logical arguments you please). One of the best way I have found to garner the attention of friends is through their curiosity. Granted, most Millennials couldn\'t give less of a crap about politics and economic news, what they do care about is sensationalism. It\'s what drives our social media sprees. Hell, it\'s what\'s driving this discussion now on PizzaGate.</p>',

Next You must target the sick fuck in the red mask in all the shows. His name is majestic Monkey and these are the videos he puts out
            <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8mVXiBxVHA&amp;t=76s">
             https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8mVXiBxVHA&amp;t=76s
            </a>
            Show this to your correspondent, it will disturb them on an emotional level and warm them up for the next step- video education.
            <br/>
            By now most of you have probably seen numerous videos on the subject of PizzaGate and have a few in mind that you can't wait to show. And I am not going to limit your choices by posting all the ones I know on here. However I do feel the need to warn you to stay away from showing off-shoot YouTube Videos that look like a crazy loon made it. Find someone reputable or has some experience being an actual journalist who published videos on this subject. Find an even toned and balanced video to introduce your target to.
            <br/>
            Two videos I would suggest checking out is:
            <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yiLNkIiyKuU">
             https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yiLNkIiyKuU
            </a>
            and
            <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHCvcCaK26Y">
             https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHCvcCaK26Y
            </a>
            <br/>
            I hope this all helps. I hope this guide can help alleviate some of the anxieties many of us face when trying to tackle this enormous task of convincing the entire world.Also feel free to add your own tips in the comments section too! I will update this guide if I find other more effective tips, good day to you sirs!  : ]
           </p>
           <p>
            P.S. if your correspondent gets stuck on the NYT article because they are a mindless idiot who actually BELIEVES what the MSM says, then show them this, it will help them out real good!

            A Crash Course Guide to Informing The Uninformed (#PIZZAGATE) PT3
The approach I tend to take is to sound like I am not even convinced myself whether or not PizzaGate is real. I take an investigative approach where I coax my target to investigate the subject along with me; instead of me simply presenting them the subject. I would use phrases like "hey figure this out for me" or "Hey maybe you could make sense of this". Challenge your target directly by asking for their help. People do not like being presented with a mountain of things to dig through, they usually want it in bite sized chunks or to participate in the inquiry themselves. Presuming you have garnered enough empathy and curiosity from your correspondent, they will quickly join your search for the truth too.
            <br/>
            Now what I have found is that the order you present the key pieces of evidence you find are extremely important in making the jump from the emotional realm of conversation to the logical realm of the mind. If you do not present the information that has been garnered from PizzaGate effectively, your targets interest in the subject will QUICKLY dissipate. Any attempt to restart the conversation will be very hard from this point if you fail. First impressions really do matter and will forever stay in the mind of your correspondent.
            <br/>
            The first piece of information one presents is the most important. It is supposed to hook the attention of your target while providing an instantly verifiable basis. My favorite to start with is what I call the google translate strategy ; ]
            <br/>
            You ask your target if they can figure this out for you. Tell them to look up any article from a well known source (does not mean well credited source) like the New York Times that a lot of these leftist liberals tend to follow like the bible. You bring up any article by them regarding PizzaGate, by this point we know all the articles written by NYT are absolute one sided trash, but that is not the point here. The point is to find a FAULT in the main narrative. A direct CRACK you can point to that is published by the MSM themselves that will kick off the interest of your correspondent. In this case I chose to use this article
            <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/21/technology/fact-check-this-pizzeria-is-not-a-child-trafficking-site.html">
             http://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/21/technology/fact-check-this-pizzeria-is-not-a-child-trafficking-site.html
            </a>
            <br/>
            The article gives a poorly written explanation (though not evident to your misinformed correspondent) on the shallowest talking points regarding PizzaGate. The article even goes out of it's way to give one sided arguments as to why PizzaGate is a Hoax and why it should be regarded as fake news.  it is your job to disprove them later once you have brought them to the logical realm. The first paragraph of the article reads "WASHINGTON — Days before the presidential election, James Alefantis, owner of a local pizza restaurant called Comet Ping Pong, noticed an unusual spike in the number of his Instagram followers." The name of the Store owner is mentioned here, this is cold hard fact that is verifiable through years of public records. This is the man who owns Comet Ping Pong Pizza Shop and this is an undeniable FACT, this HAS to be set in stone before you continue.
            <br/>
            Once you've brought the attention of your correspondent onto the name of the store owner, James Alefantis, this is where the google translate strategy comes into play. You tell your target to open google translate on their browser or phone, and set the input language to English, output language to French. Tell them to type in "I love Children" in input and watch their Jaw drop as they see what comes out the other end. "J'aime des enfants" This is what comes up in French when you type in "i love children" into google translate. The similarities in the names are striking and should be damning all by itself. At this point you would have gained considerable curiosity from your target (assuming they aren't being willfully ignorant). They have now used logical strategies to come up with definite conclusions to what they see. One cannot argue with you that the man's name means I Love Children in French. And can only ask the question why someone would possibly have an alias such as that. When coupled with the whole treasure trove of other information out there, there should be more than sufficient evidence to prosecute this sick fuck.
            <br/>
            The next thing you need to bring your correspondents' attention to quickly is the Instagram posts by the store owner under Jimmy rocket. All significant posts have been archived and can be found in the Voat forums above. This provides solid visual imagery that millennials can recognize as Instagram posts. It is a highly relatable (not saying reliable) source of information.

            A Crash Course Guide to Informing The Uninformed (#PIZZAGATE) PT2
You garner their attention by making them care for you first. Sensationalize your correspondent to empathize with you on a subject. This subject should be of a personal nature, something that draws in their attention to you directly. For example, you could go up to a friend and say "I've been losing a lot of sleep lately, my mind is in a whirl and I simply can't think straight anymore. Something is really bothering me." Bringing peoples attention to something that is physically ailing you tends to garner empathy from others, it makes people wonder what is wrong with you and if you are going to be ok. Trust me, even the people who do not know you will be thinking this in their minds. It automatically initiates a curious state in their minds as they probe for a reason for your ailment.
            <br/>
            If successful, you usually would get inquiries as to why you feel the way you do. You are bringing your target into the sensationalist realm where feelings dominate. By talking about how you are feeling first, and showing that you are truly indeed troubled by what you have heard, WILL gain the attention of your peers. You will have convinced them that what is ailing you is genuine since they see the reaction first. You will have started communicating with them on the emotional level.
            <br/>
            The next step is to establish a factual anchor in the conversation that you and your target are both aware of in order to find common factual ground for both of you. The target of this is to sensationalize the conversation and direct it to an established factual subject that can be immediately verifiable by those engaged. For example, once you've directed your friends attention to why you have been losing sleep and as to why you are feeling troubled and concerned, bring up a factual event that has recently happened that you both can easily discuss; something that people can easily fact check and believe. It is also key to note that this factual event must in NO way be connected DIRECTLY to PizzaGate or they WILL write it off as "fake news". You have to inform them on a subject that is related to PizzaGate without actually being connected to Pizzagate...if you catch my drift. The best example that I have been using for the last few days is the enormous pedophile ring that has been busted in Norway as of Nov 23rd 2016. This is a VERY recent event that has occurred, and I advice you guys to look this up when you can too.
            <a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/norway-paedophile-ring-police-arrest-51-men-a7432441.html">
             http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/norway-paedophile-ring-police-arrest-51-men-a7432441.html
            </a>
            This convinces your target the pedophiles do exist and it IS a thing that happens in this world, even in this day and age. There are many who cannot even come to terms with this simple fact.
            <br/>
            The next step is to ask if they have heard about this subject, in this case I am using the Norwegian pedophile ring that busted 51 men yesterday. Once you've garnered enough empathy from your correspondent, it is time to introduce them to this subject. Ask them if they heard of it. Tell them about it. Tell them why it is ailing you, why it has been disturbing you and how utterly sick these people are. There really isn't any need for acting here, these 51 individuals are outright disgusting. They have been either been recorded planning to rape their infants or have forced child on child sex. It is an utter mess. Research and find as many grueling details about this event as you can and memorize them. Spew them out one after another at your target. Get them grossed out at what is happening in this world (because this is only the warm up for what you are about to bring to light). You must inspire as much hatred and disgust for pedophiles as you do this in order to obtain the necessary emotional hatred needed to bridge the correspondent to PizzaGate. Talking about this factual established event, however, will have effectively established the anchor you need in the emotions of your correspondent. Now they may feel the way you do, disturbed and curious about the dark corners of this world. And this is where you get them. You must appeal to their imagination.
            <br/>
            You mention this other child trafficking ring you have been hearing about. It is a ring that is so sinister, and so evil that it shakes the very bones in your body. It is so blatantly obvious that you can't believe no one else knows about it. Many would take this as a challenge. They already feel empowered about the knowledge you have enlightened them on in Norway, how could they not see the pedophilia in THIS case? This drives the imagination of your target, it makes them wonder what you are talking about, it opens up their minds for logical arguments. This is your chance to introduce them to PizzaGate, but it is also the most sensitive and difficult stage to accomplish. If you do have your cards lined up right however, you should be able to make a very quick pitch to your target in a very short amount of time (since everyone has an attention span of a toddler these days it seems.)
