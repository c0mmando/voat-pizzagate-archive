            <p>
             Family leadership, admitting only that some children were abused from 1978 until 1986, created policies prohibiting excessive discipline and sexual contact between adults and minors. Those found to have abused children after December 1988 are supposedly excommunicated, but their crimes are also allegedly often left unreported to the police. In a now-exposed secret directive, current leader Karen Zerby declared in 1993 that child-adult sex is not inherently wrong. She explained that although they were forced to show outsiders they were complying with the law, members should not lose sight of what they truly believe on the inside. To deny culpability and uphold its image makeover, The Family requires members to leave the group if they wish to report child abuse to a law enforcement agency, or pursue legal action against an alleged abuser within the group—as a result they can technically say that no members have reported any sexual crimes as of late.
Founder David Berg, who initially lived with the first colonies (their early name for Communities or Homes), moved away to live in secret locations known only to top ranking leaders of the group. He communicated with his followers via Mo Letters—directives on a myriad of spiritual and practical subjects—until his death in late 1994, when his mistress Karen Zerby took over leadership of the Family.

             Practiced since 1995 by members of the Children of God/Family International — both male and female members as young as 12, but more fully from the age of 14, are taught that Jesus literally desires to have sex with them.
The "Loving Jesus revelation" calls on Family members to do three things:
They are to visualise their sexual activity as happening with Jesus;
They are called on to masturbate to Jesus — men are instructed to visualise themselves as women so that Jesus can make love to them; 
They are told to say "love words," or talk dirty, to Jesus as they are having sex. Karen Zerby has published a list of sexually explicit expressions that her followers could use when making love to Jesus

           <p>
            "In 1992, the same year that PAS was established in Russia, in Florida a team of members of the Family enlisted as Red Cross volunteers to help with relief efforts after Hurricane Andrew. There they met President Bush and through this chain of events were invited to the White House where they sang at a reception during Christmas. Since then Family members have participated in more such events. The following are thank-you notes from the White House! "Dear Family Teens, I loved hearing from you and catching up on your news. I am so proud of you and what you stand for. Warmly, Barbara Bush." "Dear Family Singers, Thank you for the generous support of the 1995 White House Easter Egg Roll. Nearly 30,000 attendees joined us for the 117th year of this White House family tradition. Your efforts contributed significantly to the success of this event. Sincerely yours, Hillary Clinton." Here is one from former President Jimmy Carter: "Dear Family Singers, I was so pleased to have the opportunity to hear you sing. Thank you for sharing your talent with us. I appreciate the video, and will be sure that my granddaughter gets to enjoy it. Rosalyn joins me in sending you our warm best wishes. Sincerely, Jimmy Carter"."

            The Family is the same Cult that Julian Assange was exposed to when he was a child!

            <strong>
             When he was a year old, his mother married Richard Brett Assange,[14][15][16] an actor, with whom she ran a small theatre company.[17] They divorced around 1979. Christine Assange then became involved with Leif Meynell, also known as Leif Hamilton, a member of Australian cult The Family, with whom she had a son before the couple broke up in 1982.

           <p>
            These people had moles in the government and were able to track his mother everywhere she went in Australia.

            This has been brought up before both here and on Webb's YT fantastic conspiracy voyage. One I thing haven't heard discussed much is that both HRC and Assange are both affiliated with the same cult. This consp blogger maps out some of the oddities.

            Reminded me of this:
           </p>
           <p>
            Clinton's prayer group was part of the Fellowship (or "the Family"), a network of sex-segregated cells of political, business, and military leaders dedicated to "spiritual war" on behalf of Christ, many of them recruited at the Fellowship's only public event, the annual National Prayer Breakfast. (Aside from the breakfast, the group has "made a fetish of being invisible," former Republican Senator William Armstrong has said.) The Fellowship believes that the elite win power by the will of God, who uses them for his purposes. Its mission is to help the powerful understand their role in God's plan.
