<p>Bill and Hillary Clinton’s close personal friend Richard Mays, a former justice of the Arkansas Supreme Court, participated in an interview with NXIVM cult leader Keith Raniere that has now been scrubbed from the Internet by Raniere, who stands trial for child sex trafficking from Mexico. Keith Raniere has removed the video from YouTube and elsewhere, citing a copyright claim.</p>
<p>Mays’ association with Raniere is well known and documented. NXIVM whistleblower Frank Parlato preserved screenshots of Mays’ interview on the cult leader’s “Keith Raniere Conversations” program, which Big League Politics viewed prior to the video’s removal from the web. Big League Politics is not publishing the video, merely reporting its existence.</p>
<p>I’m sure Richard had a number of contacts with the White House,” said Tim Dickson, a spokesman for Cassidy, which no longer employs Mays. Among the clients Mays assisted was Eric Wynn, a twice-convicted felon with ties to organized crime. Through Mays, Wynn attended a White House coffee with the president, which was arranged by the Democratic National Committee.”</p>

<p>It’s funny how so many people who have had deep and long-term associations with NXIVM, the sex-slaver cult run by Keith Raniere, have suddenly forgotten about that chapter of their lives. The latest to exhibit this selective memory phenomenon is Richard Leon Mays, Sr.,  who just had a puff piece run about him </p>
<p>Yep, he forgot all about how he (along with former Massachusetts Attorney General Scott Hershberger) personally met with the Albany County District Attorney, P. David Soares, and convinced Soares to gin up a criminal indictment against former NXIVM consultant Joe O’Hara, who had quit working for the cult when he found out about some of its illegal activities. That indictment was tossed as soon as the case came before a judge.</p>
<p>And he forgot all about how he tried to get U.S. Airlines to pay an exorbitant amount to Nancy Salzman, who had carelessly left her laptop behind when she disembarked from a flight in Albany, NY. As part of that baseless claim, he asserted that Salzman’s hourly billing rate was $2,000 hour – which is even more than she’s trying to collect nowadays via her $10,000/month special training sessions.</p>
<p>Oh , and he forgot about soliciting political donations from Clare Bronfman and Sarah Bronfman-Igtet and other NXIVM members for his old pals from Little Rock, Hillary Clinton and Mike Huckabee. Whether he was involved in NXIVM’s illegal political donations bundling scheme is a question that Richard Donoghue, the U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of New York, may want to take a look at. </p>
<p>And speaking of the esteemed Mr. Donoghue, maybe he should also look at May’s involvement in the awarding of a contract to Aqueduct Entertainment Group to run the slot machine operation at Aqueduct Racetrack. Although Mays indicated in the newspaper article that the contract was canceled because Jay-Z was one of the members of the group, the New York Inspector General’s report on the matter indicated that the “…selection process was compromised by politics, campaign donations and regionalism”. And who was the head of the Aqueduct Entertainment Group? Well, surprise, surprise, that would be Richard Leon Mays, Sr.</p>
<p>Two other things that the Arkansas newspaper did not mention: Mays made a video recording in which he extolled the virtues of the sex-slaver leader Raniere. And he also got one of his daughters involved in the cult for several years.</p>

<p>Richard Leon Mays was an early civil rights attorney during the struggles to integrate public facilities and end bias in Arkansas courts and law enforcement. He was in the first group of African Americans to be elected to the Arkansas General Assembly in the twentieth century and became the second African American to be a justice of the Arkansas Supreme Court. Governor Bill Clinton appointed him to the court in 1979. He was inducted into the Arkansas Black Hall of Fame in 2016.</p>
<p>After his term on the court ended in January 1981, Mays returned to his private law practice and business interests. His political activities did not wane. He supported three successive governors, Clinton, Jim Guy Tucker, and Mike Huckabee, the latter a Republican. He served on a number of major state commissions: the Arkansas Ethics Commission (created by an initiated act in 1988), the Arkansas Economic Development Commission, the Arkansas Governor’s Mansion Commission, the state Bank Board, and the Claims Commission.</p>
<p>Mays worked full time for Bill Clinton in his 1992 campaign for president, raising more than a million dollars. He joined a lobbying and business-development firm in Washington DC for the eight years of the Clinton administration. He also did extensive business development in Africa.</p>
<p>His first wife died of cancer in 2000. In 2012, he married Supha Xayprasith, who was born in Thailand. His son and daughter became partners in his law firm.</p>

            A break in the case really. Make sure to watch the video "The Time I Went To a NXIVM Mixer/Recruitment Party. This guy is a credible witness to a party connecting Clinton's right hand woman, Huma, NY AG Schneiderman, STORMY DANIELS (we were right about that brand after all), ALEFANTIS (first true confirmation implicating his involvement specifically with the NXIVM branch.

            May's wife...Supha Xayprasith
           </p>
           <p>
            She was born to Phat Xayprasith, who was of Thai, Laotian and Japanese heritage, and Roy Chandura Churchill, who was eastern Indian and British. The couple met in London where Churchill worked with the Thai embassy and Xayprasith worked with British intelligence. They married and had four daughters.
           </p>
           <p>
            Churchill was kidnapped in 1975 while en route to Thailand, where Xayprasith was attending college at the time. The purpose of his trip was to close a business deal. He was never found.
           </p>
           <p>
            Fearing for her family’s safety, Xayprasith decided to come to the United States, choosing Arkansas in which to settle after a friend advised her that the state would provide a wholesome environment for rearing girls. She arrived in Fort Smith with her daughters, a preteen brother, her teenage sister, a maid and the children’s nanny.
           </p>
           <p>
            After high school, Xayprasith-Mays enrolled in what is now the University of Arkansas at Fort Smith. An early, brief marriage, along with motherhood, interrupted her education plans, but as she puts it, “I have a Ph.D. in people.” Her raw talent, picked up on by a Wal-Mart Stores Inc. executive, got her into the corporate world. At age 20, she moved to Bentonville to work at the retail giant’s corporate headquarters. By her early 20s, she was wheeling and dealing with the up-and-coming, wellheeled decision makers of the global company.
           </p>
           <p>
            In all, Xayprasith-Mays spent more than 25 years working in various corporate departments, also holding regional and division directorships at Robert Half International, J.C. Penney Co. and Sears. (She is still a corporate consultant.)
           </p>
           <p>
            While navigating the corporate world, Xayprasith-Mays was raising her own family. In addition to William, she has sons Mark Anthony Apolinar, 28, a webmaster and designer for a major technology firm in Seattle; Eli Benjamin Vandiver, 21, who is building his own business, Benjamin Sparklean Professionals &amp; Co.; and daughter Haley Brooke Vandiver, 19, a student and Wal-Mart employee.
           </p>
           <p>
            Xayprasith-Mays also has raised some businesses of her own. She opened two Thai restaurants in Bentonville. I Love New York Fashions has had a couple of storefronts and continues to be sold in other boutiques and online. In addition, Xayprasith-Mays founded Inclusion, an eclectic Little Rock-based bimonthly magazine. She plans to soon introduce a skin-care line as well as a radio station, KINCFM, 97.9.

            Police Investigate Sex Offenders Living Near Slain Bentonville Child
           </p>
           <p>
            No suspect has been named in the murder of a 6-year-old Bentonville girl. However, law enforcement agencies are looking into sex offenders who may live in the area where Jersey Bridgeman was found dead Tuesday, said Bentonville Police Captain Justin Thompson.
           </p>
           <p>
            Jersey’s body was found in an abandoned house two doors down from her home on S.E. “A” Street. Seven Level II sex offenders are registered as living within a few miles of the crime scene.

            The Bentonville home at 608 S.E. A St., valued at $46,049, is owned by William Wallace and Supha Xayprasith of Brooklyn, N.Y., records show. Wallace has been listed as the home's owner since 2006. Wallace is listed as property owner on at least five other residences in Benton County, including one in Bella Vista.
           </p>
           <p>
            The  house at 704 S.E. A St., near where Jersey's body was found, is also owned by Wallace and Xayprasith, but the property is vacant, officials said. The pair also own the trailer at 702 S.E. A St., records show
