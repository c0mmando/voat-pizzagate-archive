<p>As a native of Norway, I thought I should bring some details about the #DarkRoom operation in Norway.

<p>The state owned media has this initial report <a href="https://www.nrk.no/hordaland/dette-vet-vi-om-operasjon-_dark-room_-1.13237865(norwegian)">https://www.nrk.no/hordaland/dette-vet-vi-om-operasjon-_dark-room_-1.13237865(norwegian)</a>
Summary in English :
The police in Bergen started the investigation after a man (22) was reported for &quot;sexual relations&quot; with a 14 year old girl, and the police sized his digital devices.
This lead them to several online networks, 150 TB childporn, 51 identified menn, at least 20 children questioned. I will leave out the horrible details, but there have been charges
for abuse of infants and up to the age of 15.</p>
<p>Many with high educations and a police officer and his son is involved, also two politicans one has been charged with human-trafficking.
This was all because some parents found out and reported it. </p>
<p>Theres been two convitions, but so far no names have been named. The police say they have discovered &quot;a deeper stucture&quot;.
It is country wide and other police districts are starting task-forces. There is also links to the philipines and CP production.
One police officer is suspended for beeing involved, and his son is in beeing held in custody for beeing central in the network.</p>
<p>It was the ivestigation that led to the FBI CP server &quot;playpen&quot;. It turn out the FBI has been taking over CP-servers and have been logging IP\'s.
But it was not the FBI who reached out to the police in Norway, according to the police. </p>

            Only speculations: As I understand it FBI has taken over a lot of the Dark Web pedo sites and use them for entrapment. My guess is that the Norwegian Dark Room probe came across evidence that was hushed by FBI so it wouldn't jeopardise the ongoing investigation. Strange though how it coincided with Norway dropping support for the Clinton Group.

             Only found one newspaper so far that say the investigation started from a tip from FBI, But the case according to the police started in September 2015, when the parents of a 14 year old girl reported a 22 year old male for abuse. What most articles include that some of the cases now being investigated is from material they have gotten from FBI's playpen March 2015 infiltration. My guess is that this is a nice bust to taking credit for + bureucratic slowness. Who asked who first? I guess time will tell.
