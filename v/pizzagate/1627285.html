            I would like to say when is it ok to get hysterical and belligerent? We are all human and there is a limit to what anyone can endure and anger that we can contain. Children are getting abused while the abusers Walk free. We here, all know the truth and have seen the photos and read the communications and emails and so much more. I am haunted by pizzagate. If you are not haunted by this if you are not paranoid, or hysterical than there is something wrong with you not David seaman. It's normal for this to affect you. What kind of a person is not affected by this? Hmmmm I say:  He is entitled to get hysterical. We all are.  Pizzagate is dreadful the stuff nightmares are made of. A little more loyalty is in order for someone who has given a voice to this investigation and spread the word. If you think you can do better than make a YouTube channel and start spreading the word your self. Put your reputation on the line and put your career at risk. He deserves some credit, these kids have NO voice NO advocate. And you sit here and try to discredit the few voices they do have. What kind of mean spirited people are you?

             Cobain didn't come up with that? Shit, that puts my one of my punk idols down a notch (real grunge like Nirvana 80's Soundgarden, Screaming Trees etc. is a kind of mix of metal, punk and stoner rock. Bands like Pearl Jam who only showed up in 1990 were never anything but a pop rock band that happened to be in Seattle and play some of the same venues). Sorry just wanted to say that Nirvana is likely the least undiluted raw punk or genre-specific band, that's why mtv and music execs invented the word grunge.

               Lol, both sucked shit, couldn't play their instrument (Sid) or were just total retards. Propagandhi is the only band formed in the 90's that are worth listening to still if you wanna go fucking hardcore punk with lyrics that aren't shit.

            This guy has been hugely responsible for getting the word out. He's losing his fucking mind, just like the rest of us. I personally will be giving him a break and express gratitude for the efforts he has made. He may appear to be grasping at straws or stirring the pot at times, but I will tell you this, people thought I was nuts for bringing this up years ago. Now the cat is out of the bag, now isn't it. 
Stay safe David. Rant on brother.

            I think David might have a substance problem, and it's tripping him up. I actually don't think he's a shill, just becoming a bit misguided and overly zealous (he does mention a spiritual experience). Also, he seems to really really hate John Podesta in particular, don't exactly know why. "Hope deferred makes the heart sick." If he's for real he needs to take a break and let providence take its course. To me he's somewhat of a kid and still green about the world.

             He's likely scripted Adderal or Dexedrine and taking more than the max medicinal dose (30mg for Adderall, 15-20mg Dexedrine...believe me, wouldn't have passed college without Dexedrine, but when something upsets you on this stimulating makes-everything-interesting like Jesse in Breaking Bad says of meth (which is sold as Desoxyn as last resort for ADD:Inattentive mostly), just 5mg, I doubt he has that as a script though, you basically need to have an uncle as a doctor to get it.
            </p>
            <p>
             So yeah, to me he looks like he's on stimulants without a downer prescription for sleep or anxiety, which is a bad idea, the 2 usually go together, when fine-tuned.

              Yeah, I wasn't even thinking of speed, just opiates or cocaine. Not weed. What you say sounds right. Especially when you mention college, David reminds me of a young college kid. And he was a journalist. That Adderall will make you jumpy alright. That's what  did Johnny Cash in for a long while (amphetamines). Bad stuff. Probably not sleeping.

              O'Neal didn't do that, unless you mean a site called pizzagate.com literally. That I haven't heard anything about, but after my late october to end of November of little eating, nausea, feelings of dread and actual physical pain from learning about this from the LEAKS from WIKILEAKS, no HACKING, somebody performing social engineering this way (a kiwi I think) asked him for his password (J.Pedosta) and his password was "password", might as well been admin. Idiot. And then the newly legalized in the US (NDAA 2012, not sure if this part is still in the NDAA 2017, some of the bad things were removed, some worse included, but afaik, propaganda against its own people is now the policy of Uncle Sam, which used to be illegal, you know what they do with RFERL or Radio Free Asia which are broadcasts that would make one NORP cringe is thrown about how the US is there for them and if they invade you or if they are already there with bases all over (eastern europe/middle east/pacific islands). They used to do it to East Germany too, of course and continue to broadcast illegally (according to the "enemy nation" or "neutral nation", as to pull these to their side) in Japan I think for North Koreans, even if North Koreans are suddenly able to get good smuggled in illegally (according to Kim), things like DVD's and DVD players with documentaries about the outside world and usb keys and a dvd or SVCD (yeah they still use SVCD there, they could have mostly Pentium 233's smuggled in. I've read a lot about North Korea, but say what you will about them, this book I read from a Russian guy who went to NK as an exchange student in the early 80's when it was the USSR tells a lot of what we don't ear about. We only hear the glaringly horrible things, like if RT was constantly only speaking of bad things the US do and show the results (dead burning children etc.) about NK, yeah, the camps for the subversives and how if you get put in there your offspring will too, so they just stop reproducing. The country isn't in famine like in the early 90's when Russia stopped giving it a cent, it's not a major shithole like Erythrea, but many people know about the outside world more and more thanks to this, and Radio Free Asia doesn't get to them, which is kind of good, they have radios with no dials since a long time with only the government's radio channel is, but some people manage to hack them without getting caught.

            This guy just rants and rants and rants. He should do some research and help out that way. Honestly, I got a bad feeling about this guy from Day 1 when he made definitive claims that Podesta is a pedophile rapist killer. Now, there is a good chance he is, or at least a pedophile. I actually BELIEVE he is but from DAY 1 I never was saying HE DEFINITELY IS! All I did was preach for an investigation into all these people because there is a lot of fucked up shit going on and on top of that I did massive amounts of research.
           </p>
           <p>
            Also, 
Did we ever see proof his PayPal account being locked?
How do we know he didn't enter is password in 50 times and lock himself out to trick people into feeling bad and in the end tipping him even more when his PayPal was unlocked? 
What research has he done of his own?
Was his YouTube locked because he was making claims about Podesta (For the record, I do believe he is a pedo) when it hasn't been proven?
Why did he say he's not going to talk about Pizzagate anymore because there is nothing left to do but wait for law enforcement and then change his mind?
           </p>
           <p>
            Stay cautious.
