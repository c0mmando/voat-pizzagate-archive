<p><strong>Book:  &quot;Trance Formation of America&quot; by Cathy O\'Brien</strong></p>
<p><strong>From Chapter 15 titled “No More Beating Around the Bush:</strong></p>
<p><strong>“Bush was wearing canvas boat shoes and a cardigan sweater as he knelt on one knee in front of Kelly</strong> in order to talk to her on her level. Bush used the children\'s television program Mr. Rogers\' Neighborhood to scramble/confuse young victims\' (like Kelly\'s) memory of contact with him and his sexual abuse. His physical resemblance to TV\'s Fred Rogers was deliberately exaggerated by his choice of clothes and mannerisms, and is further compounded by his developed vocal impersonation. Using his best Mr. Rogers voice he said, &quot;Come here, Little One. I want to ask you something. Do you watch Mr. Rogers\' Neighborhood?&quot; </p>
<p>&quot;Yes, Sir,&quot; Kelly responded. </p>
<p><strong>Bush told Kelly, &quot;Well, I\'m kind of like Mr. Rogers when he makes his puppets move and talk</strong>—like your daddy (Houston, ventriloquist) does with Elmer (his dummy). Only I\'m like Mr. Rogers because I have lots of puppets—only mine are people. I even have a King (Fahd) just like Mr. Rogers. I pull the strings (he pantomimed marionette hand movements) and I talk through them. They say my words and we create all kinds of exciting Adventures. Right now I\'m building a new Neighborhood (the New World Order). The stage is set, and I have hold of everyone\'s strings. I need you to help me— together we can pull your mother\'s strings. She\'s in my Neighborhood. That means you\'re in my Neighborhood, too.&quot; </p>
<p>It seems obvious to me now that Bush was referring to those actively engaged in implementing the New World Order through chaos and mass mind control (aka media conditioning) as &quot;The Neighborhood&quot;. Of course I was unable to consider disputing Bush\'s statement, and Kelly was certainly not of a mind to see beyond Bush\'s twist on her favorite television program. Kelly\'s big blue eyes grew even wider as she responded, &quot;I am?&quot; </p>
<p><strong>Bush stood up and took her hand, &quot;C\'mon. Let me show you my Neighborhood,&quot; He led her out the door.</strong> </p>
<p><strong>Kelly became violently physically ill after her induction into George Bush\'s &quot;Neighborhood,&quot; and from every sexual encounter she had with him thereafter. She ran 104-6 degree temperatures, vomited and endured immobilizing headaches for an average of three days (as is consistent with high voltage trauma).</strong> These were the only tell-tale evidences aside from the <strong>scarring burns left on her skin.</strong> Houston forbade me to call a doctor, and Kelly forbade me to comfort her, pitifully complaining that her head &quot;hurt too bad to even move&quot;. And she did not move for hours on end. Kelly often complained of severe kidney pain, and <strong>her rectum usually bled for a day or two after Bush sexually abused her</strong>. My own mind-control victimization rendered me unable to help or protect her. Seeing my child in such horrible condition drove my own wedge of insanity in deeper, perpetuating my total inability to affect her needs until our rescue by Mark Phillips in 1988. </p>
<p>Kelly\'s bleeding rectum was but one of many physical indicators of George Bush\'s pedophile perversions; <strong>I have overheard him speak blatantly of his sexual abuse of her on many occasions.</strong> He used this and threats to her life to &quot;pull my strings&quot; and control me.”</p>',

            Just want to say that regardless of whether or not Cathy O'Brien's story is "fake"  "half-fake" or 100% real----there are still many many missing children, organ trafficking, child sex trafficking, and satanism. Just look at the stuff being hosted on the varius "boards" where no topic is taboo. Also, how do we explain all the high and mighty and their perversions as they are arrested for having all manner of child porn in their possession and far worse!  Check this out, tried to post it but don't see it here yet:

             Yes.  The validity of the pedophilia/ritual abuse issue does not rely solely on any one person's testimony.  There is a huge volume of corroborating information available on this.

            There are some doubts about the Cathy O'Brien story. Ed Opperman did an interview with her and her 'rescuer', Mark Phillips, which made them sound untrustworthy. The background story is sketchy e.g. Phillips was supposedly a CIA guy who rescued O'Brien, then wrote a book about it whilst they went around the world promoting it. How many ex-CIA guys become famous for denouncing the agency, go on speaking-tours, and live to tell the tale? From what I've read e.g.
            <a href="http://www.rense.com/general2/phil.htm">
             Rense article
            </a>
            Phillips is a 'mis-directer', pointing you away from the real pedos and towards people who aren't pedos at all. The O'Brien-Phillips collaboration seems to be another example of a limited hangout. Very probably the story contains real elements, but also very likely contains substantial falsity.

             Thanks for the Rense article link.  I have read it before and seen many other accounts questioning Mark Phillips' true mission.  Of course at this point we have no way to be certain of the facts, but I also question Phillips' role.  O'Brien's story definitely could be distorted under his influence, but to me it seems likely that at least some of it is true.  And yes, disclosing truth mixed with untruths is the definition of a limited hangout.
            </p>
            <p>
             The many points of correlation between O'Brien's story and Brice Taylor's are difficult to dismiss, though, and I find both women very believable in video testimony.  It is true, though, that this could just mean that THEY believe their stories, not necessarily that the stories are actually true as opposed to implanted memories.
            </p>
            <p>
             Another potentially questionable figure in all this, in my opinion, is former FBI "whistleblower" Ted Gunderson, who championed Brice Taylor in particular.

             So many unanswerable questions at this point.

              I'm not saying she's not a victim. She probably is. I am saying there are doubts around the story and how/why it was developed and one should be careful about any specific claims she makes. 
The mixture of truth and falsity is the signature of these limited hangouts and, unfortunately, limited hangouts are one of the main ways we know about these stories in the first place.

            I read this book in the years following  9-11, when I began getting red pilled. It was such a horrible expose. So many names were dropped I lost count--- Byrd, Cheney, Clintons, Reagan, the senator from new hampshire or vermont --forget his name---, and others too numerous to mention inhabit the pages. There was a chapter in which she mentions witnessing all the children in cages. And she wrote about being taken to the bases, tunnels and NASA too as I recall. Even the Grand Ole Opry , willie Nelsom . Boxcar willie, and Jimmy Buffet are named as abusers and/or slave handlers. Horrible , horrible stuff---and fully supports the  Pizzagate tales which we've come across in the last year.

               No, unfortunately never did see Willie live.
              </p>
              <p>
               As far as Willie~I'm finding that hard to believe.  Willie is a stoner, laid back.  While there is probably some legitimacy to Cathy's story she paired with Mark Phillips who was a known con, liar and did his own form of MKUltra.  I've learned enough about that piece of scum to be skeptical of anything Cathy says (mixing fact with fiction) bc she was under his control.  Best I see it she went from one MK to another.  If memory serves Marc ripped off Brice Taylor on funds from her book/and she might possibly have been MK'ed by him too.  Marc has destroyed other families also by planting 'memories'.  This begs the question/why is Cathy still alive or Brice for that matter?  Who would benefit from their stories?  Not like the clintons don't off ppl at the flip of a hat.  I think there is something we are not seeing but don't have a clue what it is.
              </p>
              <p>
               If there had been anything off about Willie my friend who is his godchild would not have stood around bc in that regard he is above straight when it comes to pedos.  Plus the family he comes from is very wealthy and traditional.  One of my best friends married him, kids, grand-kids...and I would have heard something by now if any shenanigans had gone on bc my friend is like a fierce mama bear.

                Thanks for all this. Yeah I doubt seriously the involvement of Willie, groupies never seemed a big deal to him. He was one of the nicest guys I've ever met, very down home type, tho I know that doesn't prove anything. He gave a lot of his own personal time to me and listened to some crummy songs I wrote and was very nice about it, tho I could tell he was quite unimpressed and I was a little deflated. His room was heavy w/ smoke, big time, but I saw nothing really out of the ordinary, maybe a few girlfriends or wives. Pretty tame relatively speaking.

                 I was thinking about Cathy's claims/who would benefit.  Yesterday stumbled on a thread where someone mentioned this quote from Noam the gatekeeper as he was referred to/I concur with the gatekeeper analogy btw.
                </p>
                <blockquote>
                 <p>
                  The smart way to keep people passive and obedient is to strictly limit the spectrum of acceptable opinion, but allow very lively debate within that spectrum – even encourage the more critical and dissident views. That gives people the sense that there’s free thinking going on, while all the time the presuppositions of the system are being reinforced by the limits put on the range of the debate.
                 </p>
                </blockquote>
                <p>
                 Reading more of Noam's quotes this one pertains...
                </p>
                <blockquote>
                 <p>
                  You need something to frighten people with, to prevent them from paying attention to what’s really happening to them.
                 </p>
                </blockquote>
                <p>
                 Marc Phillips was MKUltra/really have no doubts about that.  So if you take Cathy who was either really abused or just another plant (without her understanding) the horrific stories keep one group gripped in fear and the other group going this is so outlandish those that believe in satanic stuff are certifiably nuts~yeah, I can see who benefits.  Bottom line, if all of Cathy's stories were legit and the cannibal cabal didn't want the info out there she would have been doa long long time ago.

                  I used to read Chomsky but quit when I heard (and concurred) that he was a gatekeeper. Thanks for all this. I didn't want to state much publicly at first cause so many believers here on Voat (I think it's an emotional attachment or something), but I've always had my doubts about this stuff, tho I have not done any extensive research. I concur, people like this wouldn't be around to talk about it. Not so easily, and openly and publicly. Maybe that's why I never seriously pursued it.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  Glad to hear from you, my head is fuzzy right now, I have trouble sleeping :) I think everyone here knows that by now cause I gripe so much about it lol. (I only hung around Montrose area in '79 when I attended Art Institute of Houston, I'm from the Galveston area, but have lived and worked in Houston a lot ...  went to school and was friends w/ Cindy Campbell Ray, she was in the news in the '80s, killed her parents, book is "Daddy's Girl." Sorry I never wrote you back.)

                   Oh figured life can get in the way lol.  You are still on my tuit list for hashing over growing up on the gulf.  Galveston area...dad's family from there/spent many summers in Galveston.  Back then grandparents would send us to the beach on our own and I'm talking young kids.  It was no big deal/none of us drowned/knew to look out for jelly fish, how to cross streets, no kidnappings etc. My grandparents lived just a few blocks from the beach.  Any of us got a cut or wound...sent us to the beach/salt water heals.  Least ways in those days before it was contaminated.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   We'll catch up sometime in pm's...you can't get away from a kindred gulf dweller that easy

             "Thanks for the Memories" by Brice Taylor is a riveting horror story and is consistent with Cathy O'Brien's accounts of unimaginable child victimization at the hands of the elite.
