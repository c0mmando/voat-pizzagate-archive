Hmmmm.... it\'s not like anti-human trafficking fronts are actually the ones coverup for pedophile elitists, it\'s not like ICMEC/NCMEC/AMBER ALERTS (Laura Silsby). Even BASED neocon John Mccain has an anti-human trafficking organization! It\'s not like he\'s a faggot who enjoys DP\'ing little boys with his fag lover Lindsey Graham! Look at his organization, it\'s 100 percent trustworthy! He\'s a good man, and has absolutely nothing to do with clandestine operations that equip ISIS overseas, that is CRAZY TALK, how could you believe nonsense like that LMAO.</p>

<p>Tl;dr Alefantis good friend who helps him run his faggot ass modern art money laundering gallery is connected to Debrah Sigmund who is connected to CONCHITA SARNOFF. If you research the Epstein scandal she continuously comes up and disseminates most of the articles &quot;investigating&quot; him. This is just another LIMITED HANGOUT operation where Jews cover shit up for eachother</p>
<p>Izzette Folgers maiden name is Maccoby, derived from the Jewish Maccobee\'s</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Maccabees, also spelled Machabees (Hebrew: מכבים or מקבים‎‎, Maqabim; Latin: Machabaei or Maccabaei; Greek: Μακκαβαῖοι, Makkabaioi), were the leaders of a Jewish rebel army that took control of Judea, which at the time had been a province of the Seleucid Empire. They founded the Hasmonean dynasty, which ruled from 164 BCE to 63 BCE. They reasserted the Jewish religion, partly by forced conversion, expanded the boundaries of Judea by conquest and reduced the influence of Hellenism and Hellenistic Judaism.

           Tl;dr Alefantis good friend who helps him run his faggot ass modern art money laundering gallery is connected to Debrah Sigmund who is connected to CONCHITA SARNOFF. If you research the Epstein scandal she continuously comes up and disseminates most of the articles "investigating" him. This is just another LIMITED HANGOUT operation where Jews cover shit up for eachother
          </p>
          <p>
           Izzette Folgers maiden name is Maccoby, derived from the Jewish Maccobee's

            The Maccabees, also spelled Machabees (Hebrew: מכבים or מקבים‎‎, Maqabim; Latin: Machabaei or Maccabaei; Greek: Μακκαβαῖοι, Makkabaioi), were the leaders of a Jewish rebel army that took control of Judea, which at the time had been a province of the Seleucid Empire. They founded the Hasmonean dynasty, which ruled from 164 BCE to 63 BCE. They reasserted the Jewish religion, partly by forced conversion, expanded the boundaries of Judea by conquest and reduced the influence of Hellenism and Hellenistic Judaism.

           Reminder that Max maccoby is the fucking Jew Lawyer who helped Alefantis and that faggot David Brock in their shady blackmail case with a large sum of $850,000 (proceeds obtained by being a commie faggot) to be exact. Max Maccoby is also the same lawyer that was on the board for Friends of the Orphans (the same group that tried to take 33 haitian children)

            <strong>
             <strong>
              the JIDF -- the Jewish Internet Defense Force.
             </strong>

            Their slogan:  "Leading the Fight Against Antisemitism and Terrorism on the Web. Coordinating Concerned Citizens Around the Globe. Promoting Jewish Pride, Knowledge, and Unity. Israel advocacy."
           </p>
           <p>
            The group says they "specifically target hateful material or material which blatantly promotes hatred or violence, no matter where it can be found."[8] The "About" page of the website says "We believe in direct action both to eradicate the problems we face online and to create the publicity that will cause those with companies like Facebook and Google to take the needed action themselves."[3] The group focuses its attention on websites like Facebook,[9][10] YouTube, Google Earth, and Wikipedia.[11] The JIDF has redirected anti-Israel Facebook groups to other pages it prefers and changed the names of Muslim members of such groups to "Mossad collaborator," among other actions.[12] A website spokesman told Haaretz that they don't break any laws and that the JIDF "prefers the terms 'seize control,' 'take over' or 'infiltrate' to 'hack.'"[12]

            This post makes some possibly valid connections but must be dismissed because of the overly aggressive jew angle. Regardless of personal feelings nobody can possibly claim that all JEWs are pedophiles and presenting this hysteria is an overt attempt at creating dissension and contention and degrading the board altogether. Since we have moved beyond Libtards and Repugs and recognize that both political parties are corrupt, it appears that antiJEW is the issue intended to divide and conquer. Therefore it makes the objective of the tread to get upvoats while at the same time, creating division and alienating objective-minded researchers and lurkers.

              You idiots confuse me.  I was born and raised Methodist.  No use for religion anymore.
             </p>
             <p>
              Given the current newstrend of "opposite day", I'd have to make the logical conclusion that you and the other shills are the aforementioned "self-hating Jews".
             </p>
             <p>
              Edit 1: Yes, because you, my Hebrew non-friend, are being manipulated just like the wetbacks, the homos (shit - Pulse nightclub, largest shooting in US history that went out with a whimper), and the BLM/ACORN/Obamacocksucker/Stupidporchmonkey crowd and it goes out with a queef...psssht), the moronic ragheads, and whatever qweaky gender you identify with - cuckold or whatever submissive thing it is you enjoy.
It's OK.  We on the right don't actually hate Jews like your paymasters.  Just because you wee quarantined to the loser table at [insert DMV HS (or UK shills)] doesn't mean you have to hate yourself because of ridicule.
             </p>
             <p>
              Grow a backbone for once in your life man.  Stand up, tell someone whom you fear to go fuck themselves, and go kick ass for real.
             </p>
             <p>
              Don't waste your time on this passive-aggressive bullshit.

             It's literally copy and pasted from 4chan. Thats the best place to disseminate this information, If you don't understand the lingo then I'm sorry. It's not intended for baby boomers, it's for fascist teenagers.

              Fascist teenagers live in their parents' basements.  Baby boomers live in their own homes, have jobs, and actually have the ability to control what is going on in the world around them because they put in a lifetime of work.

                  Ding, ding, ding, ding....here it is folks.  Case and point that the shills don't even get the most basic concept that their primary point of contention - the Talmud - was compiled from writs scrawled into stone 3000 years ago.  Cut and paste from air gapped narratives.
                 </p>

                  Meanwhile, we deal in data and information, which often gets turned into intelligence that was open source 18 hours ago.

                 <p>
                  Based on their logic, the real common player here is white people.  Beyond religion, a subset of their identity (shill definition, not mine) is "Jew", small, but better than 95% or more are all Caucasian.  That is much better "evidence".

                  He loves kikes and Israel and you won't convince him otherwise. The "lingo" is just the shitty reason to reject it. He wants an answer to PG and won't accept Jews as a real problem and progenitor of this shit.

                    I mean, the shill has a basic point; 4chan in this format is hard to decipher. But I am someone who is very keen to the Jewish problem, and I don't need this to prove it to myself. I'll look into it later but naming a jew is always a sign that it is in the right direction.
