            Not trying to be a buzzkill - I just have a well intentioned question here.

           <p>
            What would prevent them from having already covered their tracks or; sadly, more likely, having people inside the necessary departments to keep this contained?

            This is great news, the only thing now is, is Sessions going to step up? so far he gets an F--------- from me for his job rating since being confirmed.....had Trump only put Trey Gowdy, or a Trey Gowdy type in the AG position I think we would be much further along in this saga.

            So for all these months of searching for tiny specks of anything that can be twisted into the appearance of improper behavior by Trump and his associates, they have been stumbling all over mountains of irrefutable proof of felonies committed by the Clintons and their associates.  Now they decide it might be worth taking a look.  Geeze go figure.

            Interesting #opdeatheaters are using the image of ERIS a mind control victim as their emblem. The little girl with the apple inscribed with K which stands for Kallista. Eris outside of the discordant Greek Goddess, was a character in Robert Anton Wilson (friends of Leary and speaker at the Esalen institute.) The book features, the implication of mind control by way of electric shocks being issued, until the female responds satisfactorily to the name “Eris.” The book was designed as a “perception changer” and they do explicitly mention this, within the book itself. It’s about sex magic, in part.
It is rumoured Sharon Tate visited the Esalen the night prior to her death. Interestingly, Hunter S Thompson worked as a care taker for the place.

             Interesting #opdeatheaters are using the image of ERIS a mind control victim as their emblem. The little girl with the apple inscribed with K which stands for Kallista. Eris outside of the discordant Greek Goddess, was a character in Robert Anton Wilson (friends of Leary and speaker at the Esalen institute.) The book features, the implication of mind control by way of electric shocks being issued, until the female responds satisfactorily to the name “Eris.” The book was designed as a “perception changer” and they do explicitly mention this, within the book itself. It’s about sex magic, in part. It is rumoured Sharon Tate visited the Esalen the night prior to her death. Interestingly, Hunter S Thompson worked as a care taker for the place. A journalist who was living with Thompson at one point noted his attempt to have her watch a snuff film – to her disgust and at which point she left the premises. ●http://www.pw.org/content/memory_hunter_s_thompson_postcard_louisville_kentucky Even more interestingly, the name Hunter Thompson is mentioned by a victim of what could be described as SRA and child snuff films, in which it is alleged a man by the name of Hunter Thompson was apparently holding the camera during the filming of one of these evil happenings.

              Interesting, but I thought Tate's huband Polanski was involved in filming porno/snuff films. Wasn't that one of the theories? That the murders were to recover blackmail? Supposedly, they filmed a lot of Hollywood A-listers.

              Interesting #opdeatheaters are using the image of ERIS a mind control victim as their emblem. The little girl with the apple inscribed with K which stands for Kallista. Eris outside of the discordant Greek Goddess, was a character in Robert Anton Wilson (friends of Leary and speaker at the Esalen institute.) The book features, the implication of mind control by way of electric shocks being issued, until the female responds satisfactorily to the name “Eris.” The book was designed as a “perception changer” and they do explicitly mention this, within the book itself. It’s about sex magic, in part.
It is rumoured Sharon Tate visited the Esalen the night prior to her death. Interestingly, Hunter S Thompson worked as a care taker for the place. A journalist who was living with Thompson at one point noted his attempt to have her watch a snuff film – to her disgust and at which point she left the premises. ●http://www.pw.org/content/memory_hunter_s_thompson_postcard_louisville_kentucky Even more interestingly, the name Hunter Thompson is mentioned by a victim of what could be described as SRA and child snuff films, in which it is alleged a man by the name of Hunter Thompson was apparently holding the camera during the filming of one of these evil happenings. (see Franklin Cover-Up)
