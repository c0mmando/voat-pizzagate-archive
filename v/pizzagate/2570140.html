            To the Irish the Orangemen were murderers, rapists, and thieves, like their other counterparts the Redcoats. Then came the carpetbaggers. Do not serve carrots in a beef stew to this day if you are there!

                The remarks are sick too WorkinOnMyNightCheese  never seems to miss a chance.  Sicko.  How can you say things like that about a little child.  These are other people's children.  They do not belong to them to do as they please.  Not to their own either.   It's really kind of like an eye for an eye mentality.  They were abused so now they get to do it.  Nope. It doesn't work that way .

                  When I think of that, it makes my blood boil thinking about the pope saying their is no heaven nor hell and the evil will not suffer.  He should be the first one thrown into the fires of hell.

                   Wow! He said that? I missed that one . I don't  Believe in hell either , however  I do believe there will be a destruction of the wicked . And here's why .. 
Some Bible translations use the word “hell” for the Hebrew word “Sheol” and the matching Greek word “Hades,” both of which refer to the common grave of mankind. (Psalm 16:10; Acts 2:27) Many people believe in a fiery hell, as shown in the religious artwork we see . However, the Bible teaches otherwise.
Those in hell are unconscious and so cannot feel pain. “There is no work nor devising nor knowledge nor wisdom in Sheol.”—Ecclesiastes 9:10.
Good people go to hell. The faithful men Jacob and Job expected to go there.—Genesis 37:35; Job 14:13.
Death, not torment in a fiery hell, is the penalty for sin. “He who has died has been acquitted from his sin.”—Romans 6:7.
Eternal torment would violate God’s justice. (Deuteronomy 32:4) When the first man, Adam, sinned, God told him that his punishment would simply be to pass out of existence: “Dust you are and to dust you will return.” (Genesis 3:19) God would have been lying if he were actually sending Adam to a fiery hell.
God does not even contemplate eternal torment. The idea that he would punish people in hellfire is contrary to the Bible’s teaching that “God is love.”—1 John 4:8; Jeremiah 7:31.

                    The church as usual has been lying through their teeth.  They have preached that there is suffering in hell.  All along people have thought those that wrong horribly would suffer eternally.  I never thought about punishing small crimes, To me it was things like we read about.  This is a disappointment indeed.  The raping of children deserves something more than just disappearing.   Besides if that is true why are all those people still here.  Puzzling.

                      The Bible basically describes the second death as a final destruction; the end of all existence. If you add up all of the references to Hell, Hades, Sheol, the Pit, Death, the Valley of Hinnom, Gehenna, Tartarus, etc...(all of these are mentioned in the Bible)... you may see that they are mostly figurative references to three different states beyond life:
                     </p>
                     <ol>
                      <li>
                       <p>
                        Dead (described as ‘sleeping’), but awaiting resurrection (and judgement). When I try to understand this, I think of it as remaining in God’s memory, to be brought back later, in paradise or judgement. There are many scripture to support this, including the stories of all of the various resurrections.
                       </p>
                      </li>
                      <li>
                       <p>
                        2nd Death. The punishment for people that are judged to be bad. The Bible clearly states that this real over and over. Sometimes it is described as a punishment of being consumed in a burning fire, like in Matthew 13:30 “Let both grow together until the harvest, and in the harvest season, I will tell the reapers: First collect the weeds and bind them in bundles to burn them up; then gather the wheat into my storehouse.’” Here, good and bad people grow together until the end, where they are sorted and the evil get burned up.
                       </p>
                      </li>
                      <li>
                       <p>
                        The abasement of the evil spirits. This is the tough one to understand. The Bible seems to tell us, in a few places, that the rebellious angels are severely punished or abased. After the flood, they are imprisoned somewhere. Wherever, or whatever it is, Jesus went there; 1 Peter 2:18-20 “For Christ died once for all time for sins, a righteous person for unrighteous ones, in order to lead you to God. He was put to death in the flesh but made alive in the spirit. And in this state he went and preached to the spirits in prison, who had formerly been disobedient when God was patiently waiting in Noah’s day, while the ark was being constructed, in which a few people, that is, eight souls, were carried safely through the water.”
                       </p>
                      </li>
                     </ol>
                     <p>
                      Later, they were thrown out of the spirit realm, back down to the earth: Revelation 12:12 “On this account be glad, you heavens and you who reside in them! Woe for the earth and for the sea, because the Devil has come down to you, having great anger, knowing that he has a short period of time.” And Revelation 9:9 “So down the great dragon was hurled, the original serpent, the one called Devil and Satan, who is misleading the entire inhabited earth; he was hurled down to the earth, and his angels were hurled down with him.” This is interesting to reason on: were these bad spirits in heaven before, but powerless/imprisoned? Did they have the privileges of physical bodies taken away? Are they on the earth like this now? Maybe that’s where all the wild theories about CERN being demon portal are all about (half lol).
                     </p>
                     <p>
                      The final predicted destination for The Devil is clear.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                      Revelation 20:10 “And the Devil who was misleading them was hurled into the lake of fire and sulfur, where both the wild beast and the false prophet already were; and they will be tormented day and night forever and ever.

                      I think early church doctrines conflated this final one and the others. Maybe it was convenient. Maybe by controlling the afterlife dogma, early church leaders held sway over the masses. The Bible is clear and the stories are consistent as regards the end for humans, though. There’s one reason that the church outlawed Bible reading among the serfs.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                      What does that last one mean? Is it saying that an evil prophet will get thrown into an eternal pit of fire? I don’t think it’s a person. I think it is a reference to a spirit that influences humans to take that role.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                      As to actual hell, I just ask this: why would a loving God take punish His children by burning them forever? Why would He place His enemy, who despises Him deeply, in charge of such a place?
                     </p>
                     <p>
                      Now, the Pope isn’t telling it like that. He is erasing punishment for willful misdeeds, lowering God’s standards and erasing the significance of Jesus’ sacrifice. Terrible.

                       Thanks so much for your report.  I have read it, but need to read again.  This is heavy stuff. I guess it is hard to try and figure out what Jesus really meant. One important thing to remember is that the devil is here among us all.  But then so is God.

                        Totally. I respect when people warn of eternal torment. That beleif comes from the same place as mine: a desire for justice, that evil should be punished. From my point of view, the specifics of the ‘consequences/punishments’ are details that don’t affect my decisions or behavior much, only that I have more motivation to encourage myself and others to be good. I think the worst aspect is that people are not shepherded with kindness by some that use the ‘hell’ teaching like a club. I recall Kirk Cameron reminding people that they can go to hell for being bad. Initially I was attracted to this idea, because I appreciate justice. I also appreciate second chances though; because I have received a few. I made a degree of separation from those who ‘condemn’ others to hell instead of just warning them about the predictable consequences of living without God.

                        Does that make sense? I’m not sure if I’m writing my point clearly.

                       <p>
                        1 Corinthians reminds us not to make sinners feel more guilty. If we push others down, they may not get back up again. I have had better results teaching my kids empathy; using empathy to use their own consciences to change themselves. My son still gets a spanking from time to time, if he’s hitting or such, but it’s a process. Cultivating empathy seems to work well with teenagers at my job, though. Anyway... I hope I was able to share something useful.

                         I too believe in second chances but when it comes to raping and abusing, especially children, there is something in the brain that cannot be rectified, imo.  They should either be locked up for life, if the child dies same thing without parole. I used to be in favor of the death penalty, but after reading about so many wrongful imprisonments, I have changed course.  We have many in LE that are too quick to pin the crime on others.  You are doing a very good job with your kids.  They are learning properly with your guidance. Keep up your Good Works.

                          Thanks. I can’t really take the credit though. I almost lost my family, but I was able to turn my life around with prayer and Bible study. I want to respond to the first part of your comment there: I agree with you in many ways. When it comes to the earthly consequences of our actions: they are what they are. If a person commits a crime, they get the consequences. Mostly, we are warned before hand. Right and wrong are mostly common sense and empathy. There are many that never got that lesson or never had motivation to reallly learn it, I know. That makes this especially hard, here in voat. I know Jesus takes a long view of things. He looks far off to a paradise, a happy community of the human family, without crime, totally in peace and perfect life.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                          He wants everyone to get there and his sacrifice should be enough to offer forgiveness to anyone for anything, if they sincerely accept it. Mannasseh is a figure from the Bible that is a good example; an Israelite king that was in to temple orgies, black magic and child sacrifice. Apparently he was forgiven, but he still had consequences to face. He lost everything, and the nation he mislead was judged, however, we may meant to understand from the account that he achieved forgiveness and is in line to be resurrected in righteousness.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                          I understand that. I can ALMOST taste paradise, and trying to visualize it keeps me going forward and strengthens my faith. The hard part for me, is loving EVERYONE. That’s my weak point. I have trouble with the idea of praying for an evil doer, loving them, accepting them if they repent... I’m not a perfect man, and right here you can see my imperfection shining through. I pray about this a lot. If I really want to follow Jesus as my boss, and imitate him, then this is something I really have to work on. The ones that don’t repent will get a final reckoning, I’m sure, and that brings me a lot of comfort.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                          Jonah was the same. He was ORDERED to go and preach a warning of repentance or judgement to the ultra violent nation of the Assyrians in Nineveh. They were pagans, magicians and cruel vicious warriors. Jonah apparently hated them and refuse to offer them a second chance. Later, Jonah was obligated to change his view. After he gave the message, though, he waited and watched, expecting them to NOT repent... to be judged and destroyed like Sodom. They repented. They were spared for a generation. Jonah was really bothered by this. But the final lesson was clear: God can do whatever He wants with His own things. If we serve Him, we have to respect that.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                          That’s REALLY challenging, obviously, because I am beyond angry about these crimes.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                          EDIT: I really believe in the resurrection. That’s real hope for all of the innocent victims, including those of the death penalty, though I don’t really support it either. I respect it though.

                           It's hard trying to live up to Jesus's wants for us.  I don't think I will ever be able to forgive child rapists and murderers.  It just is not and will not ever be in my heart.  I can pray to God to help me do it, but I know it won't be sincere.  I am human and not perfect, this is a fault that may never be rectified.  I have not read the Bible for years I just don't have the time. I try to live my life the best I can and know I will never be as perfect as He would like.  I talk to God out loud, mostly to thank and also when I get angry at Him.  It is always a Love Relationship though.  I talk like I do to a friend or a brother or sister.  Mostly though I pray to his Mother Mary.  We have a Very Good relationship.  I have a statue of her.  She is very beautiful.  I do better with her.  She is the Virgen de Guadalupe.

                            I think God understands very well that we are not perfect. I’m sure he appreciates the effort we have made and undedstands when we fail. Maybe we don’t have it in our hearts to forgive. But we make an effort, we admit we ur failing. I suspect the time for God’s patience to run out is almost here. If His perfect patience and wisdom and love is reaching a limit, it’s no wonder that our patience and forgiveness has run out, right? I commend you for your effort to meditate on these weighty matters. It does you credit. I’m sure God appreciates the effort you make to consider how He feels. I know I always enjoy these conversations with you. Keep your chin up.

                             Thank you for your words so very meaningful and feeling.  I too don't know how  this could go on much longer. I have read some horrible things today.  Will have trouble sleeping again tonight. But prayer usually helps me.  Thank you again.
