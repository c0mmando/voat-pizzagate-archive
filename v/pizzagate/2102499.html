<p>&quot;In Vermont, at a state beach, a mother is reprimanded by Authority for allowing her 6 month old daughter to go about without her diapers on. Now, if children go around naked, they are liable to see each others sexual organs, and maybe even touch them. Terrible thing! If we bring children up like this it will probably ruin the whole pornography business, not to mention the large segment of the general economy which makes its money by playing on peoples sexual frustrations.&quot;</p>

             Reading the comments on that post -- a user makes a decent argument regarding a biopsy....just throwing it out there. Clearly anything is plausible with a Clinton/Bush/Cheney in motion.

             Asked about the Clintons' wealth, Sanders responded: "Theoretically you can be a multibillionaire and in fact be very concerned about the issues of working people. Theoretically that's true. When you hustle money like that, you don't sit in restaurants like this. You sit in restaurants where you spend, I don't know what they spend, hundreds of dollars for dinner and so forth. That's the world you are accustomed to. And that's the worldview that you adopt. I'm not going to condemn Hillary and Bill Clinton because they've made a lot of money.

            This is only SICK if you read it a certain way.  You may want to read it that way depending on your thinking.  How would you read it if this were about Trump?  Read it as it should be read, please.  With an open mind and not as someone against Jews  or someone that has opposite political views. That is how I have read many articles and views on here about Trump.  Remember what would you say if Trump had made that statement. Thank You.

            I'm not a Bernie fan , but in his defense, I believe the comment was being made sardonically. --In other words, I think he's making a dig at  the phony people who by their "authority" make a mother put clothes on the 6 year old, and then perhaps enjoy porn and/or suffer from other sexual neuroses. He's contrasting  the innocence of a little child unclothed at the beach(perfectly acceptable over in europe) with the knowing violation of children used  in the pornindustry. (I hope anyway)

             Agreed! I think he was being sarcastic like he often is! Accusation that Bernie is a pedophile is absurd.

             Thank you for posting that.  That is how it should be read.  Objectively, Not through a Political Lens.  I will now post something I posted a couple months ago when we went through the same kind of slamming and misinformation that many have read and learned from the conservative sites that will slam anyone that is running against their candidate.  Just as WaPo ran many articles against Bernie.  Here is my Comment:

             You heard, you did not research this before spreading that? Please research. Again you are wrong about the 6M dollar house. Please research. Many are jumping on the trash Bernie band wagon because they are huge Trump supporters. I have never trashed Trump on here. I did not vote for him and many on here know that I have always said that I am willing to give him a chance. I don't think some are willing to do the same for Bernie. Please Read this link: Thanks.

             Also, the FBI Investigation was under Comey's reign and I add that Jane was trying to buy land owned by the Burlington Roman Catholic Diocese. Bishop Coyne who heads it was ordained at St John's Seminary in Boston Archdiocese, they are connected to the Jesuits. Need I say anymore? Here is info on Coyne if you need proof.

               Yes.  I agree.  I think they are trying to Swiftboat Jane.  In the thread someone brought up that he was threatened and bruises on the internet.  Well, yes there was a pic of him that was immediately removed.  I saw it on my phone and by the time I passed it to a friend it disappeared not to be found again.  At least not by me.  This was right before he was to be announced by Nina Turner who was immediately pulled from that and that the DNC called Bernie and told him she would not be doing it and that Tulsi Gabbard would be doing it.  Nina Turner was to give a press conf. explaining what happened but she never appeared.  Many were waiting for her including Danny Glover Susan Sarandon Josh Fox but she never showed up.  Many supporters were watching for her and she did not appear.  Hours later she appeared on MSNBC and spoke with a straight face, as though nothing had happened.  I believe she was also threatened.  They did not want her to appear because as a black woman she has a powerful message and voice.  They did not want to give her the moment she would probably take to speak the real truth.  Believe me, she would have veered off track and would have unleashed what they did not want to become unknown.  Also, she would become a powerful possible black woman candidate for President.  The First Black Woman President.  Whoever thinks that Bernie was tainted is wrong imo, he and Nina were threatened.  The gossip that went around from people staying at the same hotel was that a couple of thugs were seen on his floor and it is believed that he was roughed up after he answered the door.  I believe as they roughed him up they also voiced some serious threats against Jane and or Family. This brings to mind our research during Seth Rich about the Unions that do work for the DNC and Friends.   Now Again, this is all my own opinion.  BTW, I was in Philly for the Convention.

            Don't know WTH's going on with Bernie. I do remember that facial bruising. A little intimidation to remind him to go along with the program? It's funny that if that was what happened that he didn't know he didn't have a chance at the beginning of the presidential primaries. Did he think that since they all shared pizza that the better candidate would triumph and be the democratic candidate? Really? Since when are The Cannibal Elite that fair or cavalier in outcomes?

              Good point, but he didn't say with what. While I saw proof of the physical attack, did they have blackmail?

              It really depends on the blackmail.

             Bernie Sanders is a huge enemy of the banks.  He has been talking about breaking up the banks for decades and wants to repeal Glass-Steagall.  He has also been calling for auditingr the Fed.  Read my account of what really happened with Jane and the land buy for the College she worked for.  Also about the real story and  report of their owning a $6 mill. home.  They were able to buy a much more expensive home because of Jane's family home belonging to her parents.  When both parents had passed away she inherited the home, they sold it and thus were able to buy what they had always dreamed of.  A home near the water.

              Idiots on this website continue to say Bernie used his donation money which Hillary stole by the way to purchase the house. Which is not the case

             Wow missed that post.  Shocking! Did wonder why he just 'complied' when he knew Killary had cheated him.  Shame for his supporters, I watched as they were 'barred' from their seats by hired clinton operatives at the rallies, terrible.  I am just in shock at how wide and deep this whole Clinton thing is........how can someone have such power?
