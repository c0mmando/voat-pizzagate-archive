<p>This is an interesting wikipedia entry about Davide Sorrenti, one of the &quot;pioneers&quot; of the heroin chic look who tragically died from kidney failure at the age of just 21. His modelling career was especially disturbing due to the fact that he looked much younger than he was and in that context his photographs were even more inappropriate than just the normalization and even glamorization of drug abuse.</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Davide_Sorrenti">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Davide_Sorrenti</a></p>
<p>&quot;Growing up in a cultivated environment, Sorrenti painted, played golf and liked opera, but he soon also became a &quot;prep-school gangster&quot;; private-school students living a wannabee gangster\'s life, with shoplifting, credit-card scams and drug dealing as a way of gaining status. He also started the crew SKE while attending Bayard Rustin High School for the Humanities, with fellow skateboarders and graffiti artists (Davide\'s tag was Argue); with whom he formed a rap group called the Mosaics, because of their wide mix of ethnicities; and started the streetwear label Danücht.[5]&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Early work
Sorrenti began documenting his friends in their everyday actions at the age of 18, developing his own distinctive personal style and sense of fashion. Around age 19, his darkly glamorous photos appeared in magazines like Interview, Detour, and Ray Gun. With his talent, charm, and juvenile good looks, he quickly became New York\'s fashion Wunderkind,[2] boosting the heroin chic-trend with young skinny waif-models appearing as drug addicts.&quot;</p>
<p>Heroin Chic</p>
<p>Inspired by the real-life subjects of the photojournalism of Larry Clark in the 1960s and Nan Goldin in the 1970s, photographers like Juergen Teller, Craig McDean, David Sims and Terry Richardson reacted against the “phony and over-retouched” aesthetics of 1980s glamour, introducing what they thought were a more truthful approach to reality in the early 1990s. Having started as an underground trend, the approach soon went mainstream when more commercial photographers started copying the style, and with the long running campaign of Calvin Klein[2] featuring models like Kate Moss and Vincent Gallo.&quot;</p>
<p>Notice Terry Richardson coming up again and Larry Clark, director of Kids, a renowned creep who has come up in earlier parts. Vincent Gallo is the guy who had Chloe Sevigny give him a real blowjob in a scene in one of his movies &quot;The Brown Bunny&quot;. Chloe also acted in Kids and has come up a lot in this research.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Davide\'s girlfriend at the time, fashion model Jaime (a.k.a. James) King, had been the subject of a cover story in The New York Times Magazine, where she admitted getting involved in drugs when she started modelling at age 14.[5] One of Davide\'s photos shows a young, skinny Jamie lying on a bed, with torn clothes surrounded with photos of famous drug casualties like Kurt Cobain, Sid Vicious, and Jerry Garcia of Grateful Dead.[7] &quot;</p>
<p>On his death and the aftermath:</p>
<p>&quot;On February 4, 1997, Davide died of a kidney ailment, possibly caused by a combination of his illness and his excessive heroin use[8] at his friend\'s apartment in Manhattan, although autopsies were incomplete.[9]</p>
<p>In May 1997, President Clinton denounced the American fashion industry for cynically abusing teenagers and helping spread heroin usage to a new and younger group of people.[10] “Some fashion leaders are admitting flat-out that images projected in fashion photos in the last few years have made heroin addiction seem glamorous and sexy and cool,&quot; President Clinton stated. “And as some of the people in those images start to die now, it\'s become obvious that is not true. The glorification of heroin is not creative, it\'s destructive. It\'s not beautiful, it is ugly. And this is not about art, it\'s about life and death. And glorifying death is not good for any society.[11]&quot;</p>
<p>Davide Sorrenti\'s death caused the fashion industry to declare heroin chic improper and passé, and by summer 1997 a new healthy look was introduced on its magazine spreads.[11] Jaime King went to rehabilitation the following year for her addictions to heroin and alcohol.&quot;</p>

           </a>
          </p>
          <p>
           "Growing up in a cultivated environment, Sorrenti painted, played golf and liked opera, but he soon also became a "prep-school gangster"; private-school students living a wannabee gangster's life, with shoplifting, credit-card scams and drug dealing as a way of gaining status. He also started the crew SKE while attending Bayard Rustin High School for the Humanities, with fellow skateboarders and graffiti artists (Davide's tag was Argue); with whom he formed a rap group called the Mosaics, because of their wide mix of ethnicities; and started the streetwear label Danücht.[5]"
          </p>
          <p>
           "Early work
Sorrenti began documenting his friends in their everyday actions at the age of 18, developing his own distinctive personal style and sense of fashion. Around age 19, his darkly glamorous photos appeared in magazines like Interview, Detour, and Ray Gun. With his talent, charm, and juvenile good looks, he quickly became New York's fashion Wunderkind,[2] boosting the heroin chic-trend with young skinny waif-models appearing as drug addicts."

           Heroin Chic
          </p>
          <p>
           Inspired by the real-life subjects of the photojournalism of Larry Clark in the 1960s and Nan Goldin in the 1970s, photographers like Juergen Teller, Craig McDean, David Sims and Terry Richardson reacted against the “phony and over-retouched” aesthetics of 1980s glamour, introducing what they thought were a more truthful approach to reality in the early 1990s. Having started as an underground trend, the approach soon went mainstream when more commercial photographers started copying the style, and with the long running campaign of Calvin Klein[2] featuring models like Kate Moss and Vincent Gallo."
          </p>
          <p>
           Notice Terry Richardson coming up again and Larry Clark, director of Kids, a renowned creep who has come up in earlier parts. Vincent Gallo is the guy who had Chloe Sevigny give him a real blowjob in a scene in one of his movies "The Brown Bunny". Chloe also acted in Kids and has come up a lot in this research."
          </p>
          <p>
           "Davide's girlfriend at the time, fashion model Jaime (a.k.a. James) King, had been the subject of a cover story in The New York Times Magazine, where she admitted getting involved in drugs when she started modelling at age 14.[5] One of Davide's photos shows a young, skinny Jamie lying on a bed, with torn clothes surrounded with photos of famous drug casualties like Kurt Cobain, Sid Vicious, and Jerry Garcia of Grateful Dead.[7] "
          </p>
          <p>
           On his death and the aftermath:
          </p>
          <p>
           "On February 4, 1997, Davide died of a kidney ailment, possibly caused by a combination of his illness and his excessive heroin use[8] at his friend's apartment in Manhattan, although autopsies were incomplete.[9]
          </p>
          <p>
           In May 1997, President Clinton denounced the American fashion industry for cynically abusing teenagers and helping spread heroin usage to a new and younger group of people.[10] “Some fashion leaders are admitting flat-out that images projected in fashion photos in the last few years have made heroin addiction seem glamorous and sexy and cool," President Clinton stated. “And as some of the people in those images start to die now, it's become obvious that is not true. The glorification of heroin is not creative, it's destructive. It's not beautiful, it is ugly. And this is not about art, it's about life and death. And glorifying death is not good for any society.[11]"
          </p>
          <p>
           Davide Sorrenti's death caused the fashion industry to declare heroin chic improper and passé, and by summer 1997 a new healthy look was introduced on its magazine spreads.[11] Jaime King went to rehabilitation the following year for her addictions to heroin and alcohol."

            Ah yes Davide and the Sorrenti Family. The parents encouraged the kids when younger to get into photography and the art world and if you notice how touchy feely the entire family is it wouldn’t be far off to say they are incestuous. Naked pics together when younger and things most normal people would find pretty vile and sick are the norm for the Sorrentis. Even worse is the fact that mother was a photographer by trade and took very questionable photos of her kids together when younger. Davide is the youngest and went to that school that pumped out other NY acting industry kids. They are currently making his documentary and pushing it hard as if he was some kind of hero. This kid glamorized Heroin hard in the 90s and pushed it out there to the extreme to teenagers and young people during that era.

            Jamie King aka James King model from Omaha Nebraska. This girl came on the 90s modeling scene at age 13 out of nowhere and became an instant hit. Even her whole look was way off for the time she entered. Beautiful with big blue eyes, long light blonde hair and a skinny but curvy figure. She admitted her agency supplied her with drugs, manager booker was David Flutie. Her drug of choice was black tar Heroin to smoke. She began dating Davide Sorrenti shortly thereafter and they took tons of terrible Heroin junkie looking photos many with James naked and underage. After Davide died of an overdose James disappeared for a while but came back in movies as an actress working with big names in big productions. She had zero acting ability and people wondered what happened and who she was. MANY people speculate that James was the reason Davide died, he was her sacrifice so to speak and that lead her to her huge success in Hollywood today. She more than likely came from an occult family in Omaha from the bits and pieces of articles about her early life. She is mind controlled to the brim and talks about political issues with an ass backwards satanic tone. Very much programmed like Alyssa Milano. She has two small boys and dresses them in girls clothing many times. James was interestingly extremely reluctant to appear in the Davide Sorrenti documentary his family is heavily promoting. Wonder why...
