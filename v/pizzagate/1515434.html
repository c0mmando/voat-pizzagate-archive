<p>How do we avoid ending up like this? There are 4 principles to consider:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Secrecy. If they don\'t know who you are, or what you know, or what you\'re doing, you will be safer. This is relative to the resources expended to discover you.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Defense. Can you protect yourself? In your home? In the streets? Against multiple attackers?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Friends. Who do you know that can protect you? Do you have allies who can function as a &quot;deadman\'s switch&quot;? </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Knowledge. I think we all know why it would be hard to throw Hillary Clinton into jail. What do you know that might keep you safe?</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>NEVER go beyond your capabilities in these 4 areas. This sub focuses on area #4, because we want to know the truth. This is morally good, and we ought to seek truth. Realize that the truth also keeps you safe, if handled properly.</p>',

            Meh. Look, there are enough people investigating that so long as you post your findings as you go, there is nothing anyone can do.

            The secret is to encourage as much participation as possible.

            "The best defense is a good offense." - Vince Lombardi
           </p>
           <p>
            In that vein, ARM YOURSELF. Be prepared. And don't leave home without it - whatever "it" is, that you lawfully carry or conceal for self defense. And be well-versed and rehearsed in it's use, or you may still fall victim.
           </p>
           <p>
            Don't be a soft target. To these freaks, "children" are soft targets. Don't fall victim to the mindset that you're an innocent walking the streets of a big, safe city. Never happens that way, and if you lose this game, no one will know about it.
