<p>We have many posts on the 1980s boy pedophile ring which was connected to George Bush Sr . Example :  <a href="https://voat.co/v/SWMBO/3558447">January 30-February 1, 2009 -- SPECIAL REPORT. New information surfaces on Israeli, Soviet blackmailing of U.S. politicians in early 1980s</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>In their testimony before the New York Senate Committee, Washington police officers Anne Fisher and Carl Shoffler provided further details on the national pedophile ring. Shoffler said a major child porn operation operated out of Star Distributors in New York City. Fisher said for young girl prostitutes there was a definite &quot;California connection.&quot; She said underage girls would be brought to DC from California and sent to ply their trade at 14th and K Streets in downtown Washington. She also said there was a young boy pedophile/prostitution network that involved Houston, Los Angeles, San Francisco, New Orleans, New York, and Washington, DC. She testified that boys would be sent from one city to another. Fisher also said the ring involved the use of credit cards that would be charged to photo studios, modeling agencies, and book stores that were merely fronts for prostitution.</p>

<p>I did a search for prostitution rings in Houston and came upon more stories, Like this one: <a href="https://www.fox26houston.com/news/18-busted-in-prostitution-sting-after-child-was-solicited-while-walking-home-from-school">18 busted in prostitution sting after child was solicited while walking home from school</a> and another ring again involving Harris County and run by madam Deborah L.

<blockquote>
<p>Deborah L. Turbiville (born August 19, 1975;[2] dubbed the Memorial Madam[1][3] by the news media) operated the Vivian\'s Friends brothel and escort agency in Houston, Texas under the pseudonym Vivian. On March 10, 2009, after an investigation that began in October 2007, Deborah was arrested and charged with aggravated promotion of prostitution[4] and money laundering. According to Harris County Assistant District Attorney Donna Hawkins, the clients may be questioned and charged.[7] Her operation catered to &quot;high rollers&quot; and &quot;big players&quot; and screened prospective clients[4] with P411, a prostitution screening service to detect law enforcement.[2] Her clientele included doctors, lawyers, professional athletes,[4] and television personalities.</p>

<p>Before I go further I need to back up a bit.. it is quite clear that George Bush Sr. was very much into the esoteric stuff .. See:  <a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1698938">Another THORN Board Member, Bush\'s \'1000 Points of Light\' and the UN\'s New Age Agenda</a> </p>
<p>and I\'ve recently done a post on a New Age school The School of Ageless Wisdom in Arlington, Texas (close to Fort Worth). It is connected to the Lucis Trust and the United Nations : <a href="https://voat.co/v/MysteryCodes/3948664">Common Core, United Nations, COVD-19 lockdown, Gates, Jobs and Disney</a> .. in a future post I\'ll have to flesh out how they are related to the Harvard Divinity School, the COVID-19 lockdown policy and a number of false flag operations connected to the Bush family and designed to usher in this New Age which we currently find ourselves in.</p>
<p>Okay, back to the sci fi circle of writers.. Hilary Ritz received a Bourne SF Writing Scholarship from the University of Kansas :  <a href="http://www.sfcenter.ku.edu/Bourne-Scholarship.htm">http://www.sfcenter.ku.edu/Bourne-Scholarship.htm</a></p>

<p>Reading through that website, I\'m convinced that they don\'t only think of sci fi writers as producing books for leisure and entertainment.

<p>I\'ll be at ApolloCon in Houston, TX this weekend. Last year, I was goh and got to go on the special VIP NASA tour with my husband and Ann VanderMeer, which is the most fun I\'ve ever had at a con.</p>

<p>Mission Control and Docking with the Space Station, and the Stardust Lab.</p>
<p>* Neutral Buoyancy Lab and the Antarctic Meteorite Collection Lab</p>
<p>* More Mission Control photos</p>
<p>* Building 9 and the Lunar Rover and the Shuttle Mock-up</p>

             <p>
              This article reviews the history of the concept of the magic circle, its criticism and the numerous other metaphors that have been used to capture the zone of play or the border that surrounds it, such as world, frame, bubble, net, screen, reality, membrane, zone, environment, or attitude. The various conceptions of social and mental borders are reviewed and separated from the sites where cultural residue of such borders is encountered. Finally, a model is forwarded where the psychological bubble of playfulness, the social contract of the magic circle and the spatial, temporal or product- based arena are separated.

            <blockquote>
             <p>
              Nestled in the hills above Robert Gray Army Airfield at West Fort Hood, past ammunition bunkers and razor-wire fences liberally decorated with warning signs, lies a relic of the country's past and a tool to shape the military's future. It's called the Fort Hood Underground Training Facility - a pair of reinforced networked tunnels with 2-foot-thick concrete walls dug nearly 1,000 feet into the hillside.
             </p>
             <p>
              Originally built between 1947 and 1948, it was part of a network of two other tunnel complexes constructed to house the atomic bomb. Today, it's a unique Army asset, the only true underground training facility in the country. In 1947, West Fort Hood was known as Killeen Base, and it, along with locations at Kirtland Air Force Base, N.M., and Fort Campbell, Ky., became an ideal spot to store the nation's nuclear arsenal...
             </p>
             <p>
              Killeen Base became known as Site Baker, which was jointly run by the U.S. Air Force and the Atomic Energy Commission.
             </p>
             <p>
              "The U.S. Air Force maintained the maintenance part. The storage side (where the plutonium cores were kept) was maintained by the Atomic Energy Commission," said Lauer. "There was a separation between them. Later on, and I don't know what point, the Army took charge of the Air Force side. That was done so no one service or agency had total control over any weapon system." He added that military personnel were forbidden to enter parts of the facility under Atomic Energy Commission control.
             </p>
             <p>
              Lauer said he's heard all kinds of stories from residents about the complexes, from a tunnel running from the Gulf of Mexico so the complex could service submarines,

              The latter rumor has some basis in fact, as the Sept. 11, 2001, terror attacks changed the bunker's fortunes. Starting in 2002, Lauer said, the U.S. Special Operations Command took over the complex, starting renovations and conducting training for the next two years.
             </p>
             <p>
              The details of that training is classified, but when special operations finished, the complex was transferred to III Corps in 2006, which recognized its capabilities for training soldiers.
             </p>

              ..."Obviously, (the tunnels) were highly classified. Even people in the know weren't allowed to talk about it," he said. "If you were a soldier assigned to work there, you couldn't wear your unit patch on your uniform."  The other tunnel in the complex is off limits due to ongoing research. Lauer said various government agencies, both military and civilian, use it to test underground sensing equipment, as well as other classified training exercises.

                Weird thing here is trail cams are the hardiest cameras possible, the least theyd be is waterproof. I think these are streaming cameras that would work better for webcams / surveillance , less for outdoor adventuring.

                The first guy didnt even get a camera. That sounds like a front.

             To celebrate the reactivation of Ballroom’s latest commission, Haroon Mirza’s
             <strong>
              stone circle
             </strong>
             , Ballroom presented a very special program at the
             <strong>
              Crowley Theater
             </strong>
             .
            </p>
            <p>
             First we screened PASSAGE, a short film by artist and co-founder of the CineMarfa film festival, Jennifer Lane, which
             <strong>
              documents megaliths
             </strong>
             across the Iberian Peninsula. The screening was followed by a short talk on West Texas petroforms – human-formed shapes made by lining up rocks into patterns on open ground – by William A. Cloud, Director of the Center for Big Bend Studies. This was followed by a conversation between filmmaker, archeologist, Ballroom’s director, and the public.
             <strong>
              The evening culminated in a full moon activation of the stone circle.

His first radio gig was as sports director at KAGG, Aggie 96 in Bryan/College Station. Tom has received 10 first-place recognitions from the Texas Associated Press Broadcasters for not only his work in sports but for his work the last nine years as producer and host of "Bravo Brazos Valley," a daily radio program that features positive stories of the people, programs, and events of the Brazos Valley.

The show salutes and highlights the war stories of military veterans from the Brazos Valley. Tom and his wife Judy have three sons, two daughters-in-law, and five grandchildren. Most free weekends, they can be found spending time together in Port Aransas, where some day they hope to retire.

            <p>
             Charles Turbiville, who is from College Station and is the son of a radio sportscaster there, graduated from Texas A&amp;M Consolidated High School... The couple lived a simple life, with few signs of significant wealth, and cared greatly for their daughters, ages 1 and 3. They rent their west Houston home. Both drove 6-year-old cars — she a Lexus sedan and he a Chevrolet Tahoe.
            </p>
            <p>
             Nearly two weeks ago, that seemingly quiet existence fractured when police arrested the couple and charged them with promoting prostitution. They allegedly ran a brothel and call-girl operation based in hotel rooms and on Memorial Drive...Vice squad investigators said the Turbivilles’ escort business was the largest they had encountered based on the number of customers who used their services. Customers are said to number 700 to 1,000 and included white-collar executives, at least one doctor and at least one lawyer,
             <strong>
              whose names have so far been kept secret.
             </strong>
            </p>
            <p>
             Police note that the couple are managing members of
             <strong>
              Wazala.com LLC
             </strong>
             , according to records on file with the Texas Comptroller’s Office, but they didn’t report earning any money.

            <p>
             In 1988, Scott and Richard Rainwater, a financier from Fort Worth, each put up $125,000 in working capital in their new company, Columbia Hospital Corporation,[23] and borrowed the remaining money needed to purchase two struggling hospitals in El Paso for $60 million..
            </p>
            <p>
             Rainwater - The son of a Fort Worth grocer and a J. C. Penney sales clerk, Richard Rainwater got his start at 26, when Sid Bass stole him away from Goldman Sachs to manage the Bass family portfolio. Rainwater’s particular genius—buying troubled companies in faltering industries, installing new management, and turning huge profits—was most famously on display in 1984, when
             <strong>
              he and Sid invested $478 million in the then-floundering Walt Disney Company
             </strong>
             , a deal that reaped billions.
             <strong>
              Rainwater set up his own shop two years later and became a kingmaker, putting together the 1989 deal that allowed George W. Bush to buy a stake in the Texas Rangers and generating most of the future president’s personal wealth.
