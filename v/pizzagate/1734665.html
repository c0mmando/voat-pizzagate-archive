<p>A man has been discovered on YouTube, called Jonathan with a video titled &quot;Trump-Russia&quot; Dirty Dossier, uploaded on Feb 26th 2017. In this video he speaks about how people he knew tried ganging up on him to partake in sexual abuse. The guy decided to look into these people and why they were after him and sent the material to the police, but they weren\'t interested.</p>
<p>In another video on March 4 2017, the guy speaks about how his room mate in 2016 was a cyber-stalker/pedo/predator with strange tendencies he didn\'t realize till later on. He says he was unfortunately fooled into signing some life insurance scam through his family and that room mate of whom all didn\'t like him. Later in the year he noticed his family and room mate was planning to kill him after discovering a well-set out plan of how such was to happen which he began to compile together to later take legal action. He soon compiled enough, handing it in to the FBI &amp; police.</p>
<p>He says his &quot;dossier&quot; then got flipped around and parts leaked to press with what seems to be a rewrite to make it sound like it was Trump of whom did all these actions, which he says was totally false. He says the dossier he had handed in, which included info from his &quot;creepy&quot; roommate mentioned the DNC. Videos, photos and text of a setup to sexual assault. This part doesn\'t exactly make sense, as he speaks about the Russian dossier as if it was about sexual activity but it barely mentions that – a possible sign there is more pages of the fake Russian dossier to come, or indeed a completely different one. </p>

you've outted yourself shill. take your own advice and "take a xanax, relax, and go to sleep" because you're a "nothingburger."
           </p>
           <p>
            Or switch sides and contribute to something greater than minimum wage. How you can scroll through and try to distract from injustices like laura silsby being prosecuted for human trafficking and then changing her name and working for amber alert is beyond me. If you haven't seen this yet, shill, you might want to reconsider the team you're on.

             i suppose it's possible, but for now i am skeptically treating this individual as a victim because he has been potentially harmed by this cabal. not sure which side he is on, although it seems like he is knowledgeable and has a successful IT career. I also trust this guy because on /pol shills were telling posters this was a big "nothingburger" and that we should "take a xanax, drink some wine, relax and that this is nothing and we should go to sleep." OVER AND OVER again. I don't want to isolate a potential victim, especially if he came out with content before the WH breech attempt, but it's healthy and positive to remain skeptical.

              Thanks for this heads up, I'll check more into this story, especially his possible victim status. I remember on /pol/ we were tossing around the idea that maybe this guy was testing security or doing a dry run. I was thinking it could be a false flag based perhaps on the premise of an ideology such as that shill Robert Steele promotes: Steele voices support for pedogate but also continuously criticizes the Trump administration, thus a "crazed" pizzagate believer jumped the fence due to anger at the Trump admin, the goal being to discredit us. I haven't kept up with the discussion on this guy. I read a brief synopsis of his supposed victimization, but it was shortly after the event, and at the time was convoluted and seemed speculative and unlikely to be the real story. I'll check it out.
