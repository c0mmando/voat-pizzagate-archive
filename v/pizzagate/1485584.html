            This may not have anything to do with pizzagate or your wifi but if you are creeped out, you should file a police report of the suspicious behavior and get some mace or pepper spray. Just today was a segment on CBS news about a rash of adult women being abducted while running and also possibly featured on Dr.Oz. I didn't watch, just flipping through no not sure about Oz.

             the police are compromised here, we are about a 40 minute drive from the Bohemian Grove. there are illuminati signs next to the Rotary Club signs etc., coming into town both directions. they think they own this town. there's no one to tell. i just wanted people here to be aware.

             i'm a whistle blower. i've been under surveillance for the past 10 yrs. i'm not trying to scare you, i just wanted people on here to know the seriousness of this,
             <strong>
              sometimes
             </strong>
             things can happen, but they probably won't to you if you're just on here reading &amp; posting. if you take action though, you can expect a reaction. i've learned a lot over the years.

            I'm sure they are not going to go on a killing spree or anything unless you said something that struck a nerve. If thats the case, keep on striking nerves. They won't do much more than stalk you and eventually try to censor you.

            Try not to spend to much time alone, when you are not at work, spend time with husband and kids.

             i'm a whistle blower from way back (10 yrs ago) &amp; i've learned not to be too afraid. FUCK THEM! i'm staying with my family right now because of my inability to work, so there's always someone here at the house. my brother &amp; i are close &amp; he knows my situation. i'm not trying to scare people, but i wanted to let people on here know how serious this business is. it's no joke and they will defend their network viciously. not everyone here can be controlled so i suggest to carry on with your good work, these people need to be stopped.

              Sounds like we are birds of a feather. Except I live alone, I have no family left. But I do intend to live long enough to see these fuckers to the end of the line and maybe one day I can shed a hell of a lot of light on them without having to do it with a dead man switch.

             i am on disability (back &amp; arms are the disability, so i can still walk) so i cannot afford a phone, so no pix available. medi-cal has a deal where they will provide you a phone for nothing i think. i am going to inquire at their office about this, that way i can photograph anything else suspicious.
