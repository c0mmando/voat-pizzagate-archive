<p>That was the sickening — and urgent — question that many Chicago parents and students asked  after the Tribune’s “Betrayed” series found that at least 72 CPS teachers, coaches, lunchroom aides, counselors, security officers and deans had been accused of sexually abusing students over the past decade. Several of those accused had criminal backgrounds that should have disqualified them from working with students — one had felony drug convictions, another was convicted of a sexual crime involving a child after he was hired.</p>
<p>No wonder Chicagoans demanded to know: How many more cases had CPS officials overlooked or ignored or bungled? How many more children were at risk of attack in schools?
In response to the series, CPS launched a series of reforms, including a massive effort to recheck the criminal and child-welfare histories of its nearly 44,000 employees. That is nearly finished.</p>
<p>Credit CPS for moving quickly to complete the background checks. It has been an impressive and expensive — up to $3 million budgeted — effort. But Chicagoans should breathe easier now.
The results so far:
The district reports that more than 350 of its employees currently are barred from working in schools. Background results on some of those employees are pending. In addition, the district says it will seek to fire three teachers, two aides, one central-office worker and seven custodial vendors who apparently failed the background check.</p>
<p>The district also still is scrutinizing the background results of more than 1,800 vendors, including custodians and nurses who work as contractors. So far, about 88 percent of CPS vendors hae been cleared, the district reports.</p>
<p>the actual number of those who won’t be back in the schools may still be in the dozens. Those are people who never should have been allowed in CPS buildings. A single predator can devastate not just one schoolchild, but many others over the years.
Completing these background checks is a major step to keeping Chicago’s 371,000 schoolchildren safe. The district also has moved forcefully to create new offices and overhaul protocols to protect children. There will be more training for those who come in contact with students. CPS also wisely has committed to rechecking background information about all employees on a periodic basis.
Still on CPS’ to-do list: Develop a reliable system so law enforcement agencies can flag meaningful information about CPS employees. The “Betrayed” series found that some district employees had been arrested for sex crimes after being hired, when they were already serving in schools. The district needs to know about its employees’ relevant legal problems in near real time, not months or years later.
CPS has a vital duty to protect its children. That responsibility is shared by every adult who comes in contact with a child. Every day.</p>

            Whoever was in charge of checking should be put in prison for exposing children to such evil people. Chicago sounds like a haven for slugs.

                 WAS RAHM WORKING WITH FEINSTEIN AND HUBBY RICHARD C. BLUM?
"Rahm Emanuel grabbed a portion of the parked funds to jump-start Clinton's 1992 campaign. Other portions of the funds were secretly transferred from Chicago to Little Rock to try to cover up an embezzlement of Madison Guaranty S &amp; L for which Bill and Hillary Clinton were subject to being prosecuted on federal bank misappropriation criminal charges. Emanuel is reportedly a double-dealer, purporting to act for the Mossad at the same time acting against.

                <p>
                 Emanuel is reportedly chief arranger of Red Chinese and other illicit funds massively flowing through the Chicago markets, disguised as soybean trading, foreign currency dealings, and such, on the Chicago Board of Trade, the Chicago Mercentile Exchange, and the Chicago Board Options Exchange. Currently Rahm plays a key role with Wasserstein &amp; Perella, New York-based alleged investment firm apparently fronting for various Red Chinese interests in U.S.""

            Janice Jackson of CPS says she will be held accountable for sex abuse scandal. 
Like many parents this morning, I’m sick to my stomach. And like many parents, when I send my children to school, my expectation is that they are safe from harm.

            After an internal audit of management practices at the school, Simeon Career Academy Principal Dr. Sheldon House was “removed” this afternoon, according to a release from the district. “In particular, the review focused on the school’s response to past events in which volunteers were able to coach athletics without the proper background checks,” said the statement from CPS CEO Janice Jackson. “Unfortunately, the audit found systemic issues in Simeon’s handling of volunteer background checks.”

            Simeon, in Chatham, is an athletic powerhouse that has won multiple state titles. Alums of the 1,300-student school include Chicago-raised basketball stars Derrick Rose and Jabari Parker and State Rep. Mary E. Flowers, who graduated from Simeon in 1970. Though the Chicago Democrat graduated decades ago, she said she’s just as outraged as if it had happened while she was in school.

            Whenever there is a problem, Rahm trots out his appointee that will lie for him and come up with some story until the next bruhaha.  This is one of those times.  Let's see how he is going to have her lie out of this one.

             Public schools have always been an unlawful monopoly. AND THEY ACT LIKE IT. They have been shuffling pedos around for years....because THEY CAN GET AWAY WITH IT.  Citizens united have the power to change this. Mass coordinate, pick a date, AND PULL YOUR CHILDREN OUT AND HOME SCHOOL.  NO STUDENTS, NO STATE AND FEDERAL FUNDING. The public schools would be brought to their knees....AND TO THE BARGAINING TABLE.  Form a parents of school age children UNION.  Parents, if you are not willing to SACRIFICE for your children, then don't complain about the corruption.
