<p>Today I went looking for an old article of mine by searching &quot;Voat, New York Times&quot; in Google. The results were numerous and caused me to write yet another post based on them. (Old article: <a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1753236">The Biggest Pizzagate FAKE NEWS being promulgated by alt media; fake definition of &quot;pizzagate&quot; originated with the New York Times\' Cecilia Kang</a>)</p>

<p>From <a href="https://aceloewgold.com/2016/11/26/the-new-york-times-snopes-was-pizzagate-debunked/">The New York Times &amp; Snopes: Was Pizzagate Debunked?</a> -November 26, 2016 (emphases mine):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In the wake of the scandal known as Pizzagate, several major publications have released articles debunking the phenomenon, including The New York Times and Snopes.</p>
<p>The New York Times article’s headline <strong>originally included the phrase “Fact Check,” a detail which has now been altered</strong> in their online editions. This may be because editors realized that someone might notice the article <strong>didn’t actually bother to check any of the claims</strong> being made. Their headline now reads without the “Fact Check” preface, simply saying “Fake News Onslaught Targets Pizzeria as Nest of Child Trafficking.”</p>
<p>The implication, of course, is that any online coverage or investigation of the claims involved automatically qualifies as <strong>“fake news,” a meme</strong> that I believe has been <strong>weaponized</strong> in order to associate reporting that counters mainstream narratives with faux-reporting and tinfoil hattery, <strong>creating cognitive dissonance</strong> in readers who are exposed to ideas that run against the established orthodoxy. By looping in news that is actually fake with news that merely runs outside the mainstream, a “guilt by association” response forms in news consumer’s minds when faced with articles on certain topics, <strong>effectively banishing them from qualifying for further examination without the burden of having to present logical counter-arguments or genuine rebuttals</strong>.</p>
<p>So if it doesn’t check facts, what is the content of the New York Times piece? It primarily discusses the (indeed very unfortunate) threats and abuse that have been lobbed at James Alefantis, owner of Comet Ping Pong, since Pizzagate took off. <strong>It references claims that the research never made (such as that Hillary Clinton is personally “kidnapping, molesting and trafficking children in the restaurant’s back rooms”)</strong>, without actually addressing any of the actual research.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It was the NYT that started the fake news, and all other media outlets followed suit, with Wikipedia proudly referencing them and Snopes in their &quot;encyclopedic&quot; article claiming PizzaGate is &quot;a debunked conspiracy theory&quot;.</p>
<p>It turns out the CEO of the NYT (Mark Thompson) was employed by the BBC when they were covering up Jimmy Saville\'s grotesque crimes, and continued the same pro-pedophilia theme for the Times, visually detailed here: <a href="https://aceloewgold.files.wordpress.com/2016/11/nyt-ceo.jpg?w=640">https://aceloewgold.files.wordpress.com/2016/11/nyt-ceo.jpg?w=640</a></p>
<p>Next there is WaPo:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-intersect/wp/2016/11/23/fearing-yet-another-witch-hunt-reddit-bans-pizzagate/">Washington Post piece</a>, though less egregiously lazy than the New York Times one, carries similar endemic issues, with claims stating that Comet Ping Pong “was the secret headquarters of a child sex-trafficking ring run by Hillary Clinton and members of her inner circle.” <strong>This is not a claim that the researchers have made</strong>.
We’re left with several “fact check” type articles with basic factual issues, that do very little fact checking, all referencing each other as evidence that the claims have been debunked.<a href="https://aceloewgold.com/2016/11/26/the-new-york-times-snopes-was-pizzagate-debunked/">source</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Then we find that Snopes\' debunking article was based on a falsehood, and was written by a blogger with a questionable past (See also: <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-4042194/Facebook-fact-checker-arbitrate-fake-news-accused-defrauding-website-pay-prostitutes-staff-includes-escort-porn-star-Vice-Vixen-domme.html">EXCLUSIVE: Facebook \'fact checker\' who will arbitrate on \'fake news\' is accused of defrauding website to pay for prostitutes - and its staff includes an escort-porn star and \'Vice Vixen domme\'</a>\':</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The author of the Snopes piece is someone named Kim LaCapria. Her bio lists her as a “Content manager and longtime Snopes.com message board participant.” A content manager is someone who works either creating, curating, and/or directing the development of articles, listicles, media galleries, or other content for websites.</p>
<p>One might wonder how, exactly, this background qualifies her to definitively rule the Pizzagate claims as “False” with a capital F — a claim that not even Aceloewgold.com‘s own summary makes. At this stage, as an opinion blog populated with opinion articles, this writer’s claim is merely that more research and digging seem geniunely warranted. Such a definitive answer at this point does not seem particularly journalistic, and suggests a rush to conclusions to prove it false–which is exactly what Snopes et. al are accusing the researchers of doing: seeking information to confirm their own pre-existing conclusion.</p>
<p>A cursory examination reveals that LaCapria’s piece contains basic factual errors. She writes about images from James Alefantis’ personal Instagram page, confirmed by Alefantis himself to be from a genuine account, as coming only from third parties. She writes:</p>
<p>“…the photographs that the Instagram account purportedly hosted were instead, apparently, taken from the pages of various people who “liked” the restaurant’s page on Facebook:”<a href="https://aceloewgold.com/2016/11/26/the-new-york-times-snopes-was-pizzagate-debunked/">source</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The idea that none of the photos actually came from Alefantis\' own Instagram flies in the face of the police report, and James\'\' own admission that the photos were his.</p>
<p>The author concludes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Ask yourself: are claims and research actually being checked, or are articles simply leading readers toward a pre-set conclusion with Straw Man fallacies, regurgitation of memes like “fake news” to create an instant negative association, active avoidance of concrete rebuttals, emotionalized assumptions, and other manipulative techniques?</p>
<p>Don’t let the declaration of something as “fake news” replace your own ability to think and research independently, or you’ll ironically fall victim to the same tricks that actual fake news achieves: a rush to conclusions during which you have surrendered your own critical thinking to someone else. Look at the actual claims, spend some actual time researching, and then when you make your decision — whatever it may be, right or wrong — it will at least be an informed one.</p>
<p><strong>Regardless of who tries to debunk the claims, it appears that the researchers have no plans of stopping their work, and that debunking-type articles only serve to increase interest in the topic of Pizzagate</strong>. Whether or not anything legally  actionable is ever discovered, only time will tell.<a href="https://aceloewgold.com/2016/11/26/the-new-york-times-snopes-was-pizzagate-debunked/">source</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Something to keep in mind:</p>

            Google Trends provides the most damning evidence that Fake News was Deep State manufactured propaganda to suppress and silence Pizzagate. Google Trends simply shows how much people search on a certain term. Searching "Fake News" began directly after PG and dovetails it perfectly.

            Pizzagate is real.  It's not hard to see that it's real by the amount of energy, money, manpower and tenacity has gone into drown it by the media.  If it weren't real, why put all that energy into trying to debunk it?
           </p>
           <p>
            imho, they have a plan and they've been one step ahead of us, the people.  I think they bought out Trump a long time ago.  I think they worked out that people were disenchanted with politicians and the system, and they manufactured Trump so that he would look like an outsider, out to 'clean up the swamp'.   They knew people wanted someone different; out of the mould.  Trump's façade didn't last long, and how he's showing his true colours--he's working for the Rothschilds, the elite.
           </p>
           <p>
            I think they have now infiltrated alternative news--eg Alex Jones, Cernovich, Watson.  I notice that those three keep advertising one another.  Someone's been feeding morsels of info to Cernovich, to pull people in.    I think their plan is to discredit mainstream media (hence Trump's words 'you're fake news' during his press conference) so that people turn to alternative news, and  then use the alternative news sites to feed the people more BS, with people none the wiser.
           </p>
           <p>
            You can be sure that if we get close to any truth, they will try to stamp it out.

             You said a mouthful there. I think you're right on the money. MSM is already discredited, it's too late. CNN has almost no viewers, so they have to make sure their message is being blasted to us through whatever media we are using. They hyped up Cernovich, gave him a big scoop, to announce that he's the new place for truth. And he lies. He's now saying there is nothing to pizzagate, the whole thing was planted to trick us and let "the East Coast pedo ring" (a new phrase as of this month) off the hook. Alex tried to push this same idea months ago, saying that he thought the govt planted emails to frame poor Comet pizza.
            </p>
            <p>
             I think we know by now that no one gets near a high public office unless they're compromised. Wikileaks showed that even white haired innocent seeming Bernie Sanders was compromised in some way. They released an emails from Brock, I believe, reminding Bernie that they have something on him, and he certainly has (inexplicable) behaved as they wished with his Russia did it! and Vote for Hillary! and refusal to confront the stolen primary... We have oodles of pictures of Trump getting way to cozy with his then young daughter, her legs draped over him, or literally giving him a lap dance! He's no stranger to Epstein. He's protecting the pedos. Presidents are just actors, it would appear. If they do get a mind of their own, they get offed.

            The Boston Globe deserves an award for worst pizzagate journalism IMHO.  Their pizzagate debunking article literally also claims that Alex Jones believes 9/11 never happened.  Any source on that one?  That's quite a claim considering that he made many movies about 9/11 and predicted 9/11 the summer before it happened.  Heckuva debunking from a Harvard graduate, magna cum laude.  Give me a break.

            Just a head's up, I upvoted many comments here, only to come back and find the upvotes gone. Noticed this too on the latest George Webb post. I heard someone else complain of this, and have seen it happen several times this week. Thanks.

            I am the author of this piece. Thanks so much for posting about it, and for all of your kind words! I've been following Pizzagate since more or less the beginning, when it was going off in the reddit and chanverses. Please share the other articles in my Pizzagate series as well, all on Aceloewgold.com. They're fact-based summaries of the most compelling research, along with other analyses, that approach the topic with a level, logical head. They have gotten some wonderful praise as being extremely skeptic-friendly, so spread em' around!

            Thanks again all.

               Ok I've begun doing that. Have you ever considered writing another article now that all this time has passed, one that would be super Voat friendly, and a red pill that would make Alex Jones' face turn purple? I looked at a wonderful article on your site, it's one that has been referenced a lot, it has everything. Lots of photos... Tons of information, but it's just not digestible length wise. And I think after all this time, there might be evidence that rises to the top and some that just wasn't as powerful, or proved false. It was just a thought I had when looking at your site (before I got caught up in the geoengineering category), and since you're such a brilliant and beautiful writer, I wanted to approach you about this before trying to take it on myself.

                The length is a struggle, but I felt to be convincing I'd have to be comprehensive and not worry about those who can't deal with the length. I've actually updates all of them as time has gone on, replacing weaker links and pics with more powerful ones, removing information that was disproven/debunked, adding new information that was also compelling, etc. I'd like to do another update, but am holding off. I think my strongest arena is media analysis/criticism and summarizing the best research for skeptics -- giving a place where only wheat, and no chaff, is presented.
               </p>
               <p>
                I did a few updates that are more recent as more research came out (See the "Despite Fake News Ridicule, Pizzagate Moves Beyond Logos and Strange Artwork -- unless that's the one you already looked at), and will do another when I feel there are enough new good leads out there for me to summarize and assess. One thing I'm going to start doing is Human Trafficking Round-Ups, with summaries of recent arrests, espcially ones involving SRA-type activities and people in positions of power. I think that will provide potent context for the more theoretica/esoteric aspects. Thanks again for your suggestions, readership, and sharing!

                 Oh my goodness, this is all so exciting. More power to you, the directions you're planning to take this are just perfect. I heard early on from a source I trust (was it Ted Gunderson? can't remember....) that there is this while system in the U.S., which involves secret society(ies?) and satanism/occult, which because of the need for human sacrifice, especially of children, leads to human trafficking and pizzagate. The system goes to every level, right down to city council. This particular interview (I will try to find this video) had the story of a business man who was invited to take part in raping a child, and when he refused, his business was destroyed. There was a club in town, of people who did this; it was satanism they were practicing, and they held all the positions of power. In church, at school, the football coach, and if you didn't join this club by compromising yourself, you didn't get the position or you were destroyed. Apparently this is how our whole country is run, and as we know there are cases in the UK and Australia that look like this same thing is happening on a global level among  elites. And their infiltration of media and Hollywood plays no small role. I can't watch 10 minutes of TV without hearing screaming, and seeing some overt devil signs. As well they are pushing pedophaelia. If you look at how children are displayed, you can tell the cameraman and people behind the scenes are complete pedos.

                 No, I hadn't seen the article you mention - that's great, I'll repost it here. Now that things have slowed down a bit, we can dig up the stuff that was missed, like your articles. We finally have time to breath, and read.

                  So glad you agree! You're right that the lunatics are running the asylum, and have been for an extremely long time. Control over news media and of course pop culture is critical to what they do. Seeing threads like this motivate me to hunker down and get to work on more PG writing!

                   That was my hope ;) partially. Plus 'they' are trying to erase pizzagate, turning it into "pedogate" and turning us away from the evidence. We have only begun to delve into the real phenomenon behind the scenes. Best to keep at this this while it's still fresh.

            I think some around here don't fully understand what Cernovich was saying, that everything about CPP was a deep state psy op, according to his "sources," to distract everyone from the "big global pedo picture."

            He has totally pitted himself against all the early hard research done here (others not mine). He's an idiot. He's a marketer, a salesman, a self-promoter (give me Seaman w/ all his faults any day), a grand-stander, a huckster.
Let's see, what else....

            Thanks for you post!  I had just seen this video (it's old however, 2013 just think of what they must be doing now)...it's an example of how MSM Fake News goes way beyond covering up real news.

            Another odd thing about WaPo. Tribe.net was sold to Utah Street Networks, Cisco Systems buys Utah Street Networks EXCEPT for Tribe.net. Not part of the deal. So does that mean Utah Street Networks still has a small portion remaining and running Tribe.net?

            And guess who is one of the investors ...WASHINGTON POST.  They may have a BIG reason to cover Pedogate. Are these 3 investors now the sole owners of Tribe.net?

            Comet Ping Pong is not the hub for the D.C. trafficking network. It wouldn't make sense for them to host it there as it is highly surveilled. CPP was a honeypot to keep us looking there instead of investigating and discovering the entire East Coast pedo network

             Well too fucking bad because we NEVER focused solely on CPP, regardless of what anyone claims. When I made the first post about the NYT, some of the members in this community set out to find any evidence that what they say is true - that we got caught up in Comet to the exclusion of, say, Epstein, Weiner, and anything else, anywhere else, that was associated with the DC pedo ring. There is no truth to it. So if it was a honeypot, it failed miserably.

              It's true PG was never SOLEY focused on CPPPeeet-ZAH(art, Apes, meeting guy saying he'll crush opponents, etc), but many things did fan out from his(JA) dealings. From Pegasus Museum; HERECOMESYOURMAN,LLC, and the other several businesses of his reinforcing walls(sound proofing?) and allegedly building tunnels to connect to down below; Pajama Factory and surroundings, Trolly Park and the codewords and Chinese consulate, the guy that is supposed to go after CP being found to have liked a bunch of infant pics on the Instagram...
             </p>
             <p>
              And on and on, so, let's not pretend CPPPeeeeeeeet-ZAH had no place in the investigation. But to repeat, it wasn't much about actual dungeons under the pizza place as they were never able to pinpoint exactly where the floor construction was taking place(probably Bucks?)

               Exactly. What they've done is blown out of proportion what we are actually looking at, and saying. And now I can't help but wonder if that because there actually IS something going on underneath the buildings on the Comet block. There is video of children screaming that everyone wants to ignore for some reason. But what the MSM and now alt media are saying is that Comet is all that we conspiratards ever did was look into and talk about Comet, literally Comet, not next door at Best, or Bucks, or nearby Pegusus, not Epstein, not Podesta! Now I'm actually getting really pissed. Fuck these liars.

            Try to venture off CPP and try not to connect everything to CPP. I think you guys have had enough evidence and that CPP is taking the fall for something much greater. Even if you guys focused on Pedowood you might have some new connections to Epstein.

             But the whole Pizzagate debunking is based on that. We can't change the narrative to pedogate. We have to find a way to debunk the debunk with simple terms for non red pilled.

                lol - I think we'll keep this up until the NYT closes in shame, sleep or no sleep. Oh by the way, the just got a Pulizer today, along with the WaPo. Next year Snopes will likely get one ;)

                      Oh holy cow, YES. I swear to you, on my Twitter feed there is nothing but red pilling on Syria. And since I don't watch tv, all I have on the topic is the truth (I on'y know what MSM is saying through my sources when they make fun of them). Search anything that Tulsi Gabbard has said about Syria. Next go to YouTube and look at the Sane Progressive channel. I'd be surprised if you needed aching beyond that, but I'd be happy to provide more.

            What a beautifully worded piece. Most definitely couldn't have written it better myself. I am from the UK and the Saville case was and still is big and well known now, I always use this as my starting point when trying to red pill people. Based on the fact that the first person I spoke to went straight onto google and typed "Pizzagate debunked". Sigh.
           </p>
           <p>
            Everyone is citing New York Times as the debunker - Wikipedia included. The guy who runs NYT covered up Jimmy Saville. I mean come on people. Honestly. Please put the pieces together already, they are laughing in our faces over this.

            Are we crazy?
Living our lives through a lens
Trapped in our white picket fence
Like ornaments
So comfortable, we're living in a bubble, bubble
So comfortable, we cannot see the trouble, trouble
Aren't you lonely?
Up there in utopia
Where nothing will ever be enough
Happily numb
So comfortable, we're living in a bubble, bubble
So comfortable, we cannot see the trouble, trouble

             It was such a well written piece I nearly copied the whole thing! It was written almost immediately after PG broke. We've been in such a whirlwind since then, that a lot of good leads, evidence, research, and articles have been overlooked. I'm hoping we can get back to our roots, untarnished by the "debunking" and the Alex Jones' apology and misinfo, because I'm seeing more and more people begin to adopt the MSM narrative. We need to put our foot down, and say NO to fake news

             Every single "debunking" of pizzagate has gone something like this:
1. Someone in the neighborhood is asked and he/she says: "no it's a nice place."
2. Alefantis says: "no it's not true."
Is the sick artwork painted on the wall debunked?
Are the sick Instagrams debunked?
Are the sick musical performances there debunked?
Are all the sick connections to "spirit cooking" or other satanic/pedophillic connections debunked?
Is any of the OBVIOUS code language debunked?
THEY WILL NOT EVEN MENTION ANY OF THE ABOVE! Nor will they mention anything else of substance connected to it.
Why?  BECAUSE IT IS ALL TOO DAMNING.
The only "debunking" they do is say: "no it isn't."  And by any definition of the word "debunked," IT HAS NOT BEEN DEBUNKED.  The correct word for what has happened is COVERUP.  And that is obvious to anybody who looks for themselves.

              Yes. That is precisely my point. Instead of bombarding everyone with months worth of evidence, let's show them the obvious coverup by MSM. I'd like to compile a list of all MSM sources and paint the picture that way. People will listen because they know it can't be doctored or planted, we're talking about "reputable sources".

             CBS Ben Swann is the only reporter who fairly covered it. He was subsequently shushed by the network and shut down even his own website, let alone social media accounts. Other than that, the only major media discussion I've seen is Colbert giving an offensively unfair recap of the early timeline. He deserves a bullet to the brain for that one. Apparently he is an acquaintance of Podesta- or they are at least photographed laughing together numberous times.

             Seriously though, the only mentions I know of are CNN's ridiculous "debunking" with Megyn Kelly and the "I'm just a pizza guy" guy.  And the other is the Ben Swann piece he did.

              The shilling around here is getting amazingly intense. It seems like shills are actually putting together concise comments.

               I have no theory.  Why are you aghast at my reply and calling me a shill?  Do you think CNN's report (whether the PG theory has any merit or not) was good responsible journalism?  All Megyn Kelly did was automatically take sides and throw nerf balls at the "I'm only a pizza guy" guy.  Not even covering why eyebrows were raised in the 1st place.  Completely irresponsible reporting...Fake news.
