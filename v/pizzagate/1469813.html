<p>What is Pizzagate? How do we Prove it to be TRUE or FALSE? Here is the Answer to that Riddle.</p>
<p>How do we confirm or deny the reality of Pizzagate?</p>
<p>Here\'s an answer to your rhetoric.</p>
<p>In USA 200,000 children a year go missing, worldwide its millions. If it were proven there were NO MISSING children that would be proof that Pizzagate is a fraud.</p>
<p>That said, its a FACT that millions of children per year just disappear, as if they were processed for meat and blood and just vanished from the earth. Thus pizzagate is an investigation as where did those children go.</p>
<p>Millions of children, no evidence, no blood, no tissue; Just like the missing 40 college students in Mexico; Millions go missing every year; They go somewhere but where?</p>
<p>The investigation of WHERE they go is Pizzagate. It is real, the children are missing.</p>

<p>PIZZAGATE - WHAT ARE THE MOD CUCK\'s HIDING FROM the VOATERS?</p>
<p>I believe that this is the most &quot;hushed up&quot; and &quot;too horrible to face&quot; truth in this fallen world...</p>
<p>Millions of people go missing every year and the vast majority are never seen again and it is never in the news...</p>
<p>Here are some sad and shocking facts about the average numbers of missing people each year...</p>
<p>France....39,000...Missing and never seen again...every year...</p>
<p>Germany...50,000...Missing and never seen again...every year...</p>
<p>Brazil...40,000...Missing and never seen again...every year...</p>
<p>Australia...1 every 18 minutes...30,000...Missing and never seen again...every year</p>
<p>England...88...Reported missing every day...</p>
<p>Over 2,000 people go missing in the United States every day...</p>
<p>Over 800,000 people go missing in the United States every year...</p>
<p>1,000,000\'s of people go missing the world over &quot;every year&quot; and the vast majority are never seen,heard from or found again...</p>
<p>And not all missing people are reported,so the actual numbers are even higher and even more sickening...</p>
<p>Literally millions of people every year the world over are here today,gone tomorrow and never seen again and i believe that the governments of the world are working hand in hand with evil aliens and are allowing this to happen.Orchestrating the exchange of millions of humans for evil alien technology.Governments that just look the other way and who purposefully down play the crisis level severity of their sinister plan and supress it from the mainstream media...</p>
<p>And every so often,a high profile missing persons case will be allowed into the mainstream media and highlighted on the evening news,so everyone thinks something is being done about it...</p>
<p>&quot;As long as its not happening to me or anyone i love,who cares&quot;</p>
<p>Is that our turn a blind eye on reality additudes?</p>
<p>How can we keep denying this horrible evil that is happening all around us?</p>
