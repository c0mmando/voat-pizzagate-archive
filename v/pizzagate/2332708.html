            Pervert Alfred Kinsey's bogus and self-serving "research" provided a veneer of acceptability for this sick crowd starting in the 1940s, and it's doing the same for modern perverts.  Indiana University is ground zero.
           </p>
           <p>
            According to Wikipedia:
           </p>
           <p>
            The institute’s mission is "to advance sexual health and knowledge worldwide." Research, graduate training, information services, and the collection and preservation of library, art, and archival materials are main activities carried out by The Kinsey Institute.
           </p>
           <p>
            The Kinsey Institute was a nonprofit research institute at Indiana University until November 30, 2016, when it merged with Indiana University, abolishing the 1947 independent incorporation.

            The Story of Dianetics and Scientology, an LRH lecture 18 October 1958 –
           </p>
           <p>
            “The story actually starts back when I was about twelve years old and I met one of the great men of Freudian analysis – a Commander Thompson. He was a commander in the United States Navy. Anyway, at the Library of Congress in Washington, DC, where they have all the books on everything, he started shoving my nose into an education in the field of the mind. Now, that’s a very unusual thing to do, to take a twelve-year-old boy and start doing something with the mind. But he really got me interested in the subject – up to the point where I was pretty sure that Freud didn’t know what he was talking about. My father was an officer in the Navy and he moved me from here to there. I studied quite a bit of MYSTICISM.”[16]

            LBH virtually bled the secretive ONI. On May 1, 1930, LRH joined a Marine Corps Reserve training unit. He was placed on inactive status the same day, and spent only five weeks of his 18-month stint actually doing anything that is public information-ONI spy, above.
           </p>
           <p>
            In 1939, LRH moved to Manhattan, NY in some very exclusive military intelligence dinner [briefing] company honoring Dr. Willy Ley. It included Lt. (Retired) Naval Commander, Robert A. Heinlein, and Lt. Commander of the U.S. Coast Guard, Johnny Arwine, Science Fiction Writers, John W. Campbell, and Sprague de Camp.[17]
           </p>
           <p>
            Lt. Heinlein was leading an off the books secret ONI operation (science fiction think tank)  through the Bureau of Navigation via the Commandant Eleventh Naval District.[18] Form the 1940 U.S. Census on Lookout Mountain Avenue in Los Angeles, Lt. Heinlein (Richard and Sigred) and his wife Leslyn may have actually been posing as German Nationals living a double spy life.[19] They must have spoke fluent Germany.
           </p>
           <p>
            John W. Campbell, Jr., above, Science Fiction Writer of the RKO Film Studio infamous thriller “The Thing” (1953) was part of the secret science fiction think tank.[32] Campbell was also an early board member of the Hubbard Dianetics Research Foundation in 1950[33].

            ONI Naval Lt. Robert A. Heinlein, above U.S. Navy 1929, was one of the most famed and respected writers of science fiction’s “Golden Age,” which occurred from the 1940s to the 1950s. Heinlein’s science fiction recruits worked out of the U.S. Naval Air Experiment Center in Philadelphia, PA.[34] Lt. Heinlein’s secret think tank also included George O. Smith, Murray Leinster (Will F. Jenkins), L. Sprague de Camp, Isaac Asimov, and Fletcher Pratt.[35]
           </p>
           <p>
            LRH was not beyond the others using the information gained through the off the books secret operation for personal profit and glorification. LRH’s Dianetics, set of ideas and practices regarding the metaphysical relationship between the mind and body, was not invented by him or created out of a vacuum.
           </p>
           <p>
            DIANETICS had some of its roots in the secret occult metaphysical theories of “VRIL Forces” and practices of Lucifer’s Servants, Reichsfuhrer SS Heinrich Himmler’s SS Knights of the Black Sun and the Ahnenerbe SS. It was classified and Top Secret and the CIA formed in 1947 wanted its Nazi pseudo occult-Vril science back.

            They were all spooks, and everyone that has created offshoots of thier philosophies. Stan Lee knows ALL about his role in the New World Order and what a DYSFUNCTIONAL IMAGINATION an do to a child brain. Get them concerned with being a superhero all through their adolescence instead of focusing on real life issues. In many ways along with all of the other input from every other false medium of entertainment captures childrens imaginations at the most crucial point in the development of it's brain and imprints on it. Of course repeated imagery and themes are repeated throughout for an overall ambient mk-ultra that effects us all.
           </p>
           <p>
            Science fiction, comic books, ALL OF IT contains MYSTICAL elements that eventually, almost imperceptibly, suggestibly lure people into studying the occult, freemasonry and the like. I've always wondered how scientists could be so cold and careless as to mes around with forces like dark matter that has the potential to turn the universe inside out, until I understood luciferianism.

            In time history will say we were influenced with such crazy ideas from all the media. Any it's all bullshit from SciFi. 
You've gotta think ahead. These (((fuckers))) are schemin' and they're working about generations so far down. (((They))) and other satanics (looking for everlasting life)  really think they're going to get away with it..

             You are so right. The term Pizzagate has been dragged through the mud backwards. I always felt that it unintentionally trivialised subject matter along with the monumental effort that people have put in to investigating this very real criminal activity.

              The term "BDSM" is first recorded in a Usenet posting from 1991, and is interpreted as a combination of the abbreviations B/D (Bondage and Discipline), D/s (Dominance and submission), and S/ M Sadism and Masochism. BDSM is now used as a catch-all phrase covering a wide range of activities, forms of interpersonal relationships, and distinct subcultures. BDSM communities generally welcome anyone with a non-normative streak who identifies with the community; this may include cross-dressers, body modification enthusiasts, animal roleplayers, rubber fetishists, and others.

            It’s probably a lax job, but I’d hate to be this “community’s” parliamentarian.
