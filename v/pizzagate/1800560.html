            Absolutely. I've been tethered to this research community since day one and finally decided to join it a few weeks ago. My motivation was twofold: to try and make a meaniful contribution and to try and steer it back to its original purpose. I've been working on several research projects but now I'm convinced that any postings will get drowned by a tsunami of minutiae that does little to apprehend a real culprit. Why waste my time. Most of my comments have been directed to this issue and my one and only submission was a call for action. We are just preaching to the choir when were not enduring the subtle and not too subtle tactics of David Brock's army. Just like law enforcement agencies issue rewards for information leading to convictions we need a forum for gathering evidence for the sole purpose of triggering official investigations which in turn will hopefully lead to convictions.  Otherwise voat.pizzagate will continue to be nothing but a chat room.

            Not gonna help. Mods are in control here and not on the good side. There were 4 or 5 shitposts on the main page for almost 2 hours. When I posted the following...it was removed within 2 minutes by millennial falcon....and finally the shitposts were removed too. Here's what i posted:
           </p>
           <p>
            How is it that shitposts are left up while decent posts are scrutinized and/or deleted by the mods? Mods must be eating dinner and/or scrutinizing decent posts to see what rule may have been violated for immediate removal. VOATers need to find another sitet to post. How about we start posting articles at freerepubllic.com, in the general chat section? IMO, the format is way better. Good posts remain. Shit posts usually die very quickly. Easier to find posts. Good search function. Here's a link to general chat:
            <a href="http://freerepublic.com/tag/chat-forum/index">
             http://freerepublic.com/tag/chat-forum/index
            </a>
            I think it's worth a try...and I am also open to alternative suggestions.
           </p>
           <p>
            Same thing happened 2 days ago. Shit posts stayed up until I criticized mods and VOAT for going downhill. Pathetic.

             Take a look at the removed submissions log.   I don't moderate constantly all day long (although I have in the past, despite it being a mostly thankless and completely unpaid volunteer job).  I pop in occasionally to check posts and remove bad ones.  I just happened to check right after you posted your complaint post.   You might want to consider being appreciative of the hard work we put in, rather than shitting on us when shitposts aren't immediately removed.

              I apologize if I am jumping to conclusions...but it sure doesn't seem like it because this stuff happens on a daily basis. The board is a shit mess. Good posts drop off and unrelated crap makes the main page and stays up. This very same thing happened a couple of days ago. Why are totally unrelated posts (like discussing thongs) allowed to remain for LONG periods of time...yet posts suggesting the pizzagate investigation is very compromised here...get removed. Are we NOT PERMITTED to discuss the fact that the pizzagate investigation is compromised? Makes no sense. I have no idea what you're all about...i'm just calling you and the other mods on the total bullshit that goes on here. It's shameful... and no wonder many think the mods are pro pedo. If you are genuinely one of the good guys...and the timing was purely coincidental...i apologize.

               Actually it's in great shape compared to what it has been before.  Imagine what it would be if there were no moderators. Yet you complain about the moderators!  (A) We can only remove submissions that break the rules.  (B) there's only a few of us (5 right now). (C)We aren't perfect.

               If you mean posts attacking the mods, it's because those are part of the problem and they break submission rules. If we allowed those posts, shills would constantly spam with mod attacks (and make no mistake: many of the people who attack mods are shills).

             Your shillery is so obvious it's laughable. If you are going to type such foolishness wait until the Voice goes to commercial so you can better concentrate. In the meantime I am going to be perusing your history to see what contributions of any substance you have made to this sub, and I can't wait to report back.
