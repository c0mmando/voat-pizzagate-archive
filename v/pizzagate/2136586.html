            I read that the Sicle and Star are sometimes called the Star and Crescent.  The Star is the Morning Star/Lucifer and the Crescent is the female deity.

            Have you seen the Black Stone of Mecca?  Look familiar?  LOL.   They kiss it.

            Turkey is involved rather big too. There are multiple movements going there. Holland and Turkey have had a symbiotic relationship for a long time, but with Erdogan in power this relationship worsened a little. Especially when the Gülen movement gained traction and got this recent coup attempt going. Erdogan was villified in the process. However, that Deep State coup got thwarted.
           </p>
           <p>
            Then there was this feud where a Turkish Erdogan aligned diplomat was refused entry into the Netherlands. However, instead of sending her back at the air-port, the Dutch Establishment let her travel up to the Turkish embassy, only a few yards separated, to then bust her with a large public grandeur. This caused a lot of upheavel from the Turkish community here in Holland. However, things did not escalate too seriously, appart from some damage to stores and other public facilities. It could have been much worse, for which the Turkish community is to be commended. It is known the Gülen movement is yet another Deep State liberal color revolution movement to liberalize Turkey and make it NWO compliant. Erdogan has been flip-flopping a few times between NWO pressure and support from Russia and China. Then the issue with the Russian fighter jet that got shot down by the Turks a little before the staged coup got executed.

            I wanted to believe...I think many of us did.  Bank of joy did seem a bit, um, campy/like how could a bank bring joy?  Conditioning???  Of course in hindsight, the professional production with most excellent music/all very specific to lull into a sense of ease/notice the bell sounds that are used in conditioning to anchor ideas.  I noticed that in the beginning but bias can be very effective for being delusional.
           </p>
           <p>
            In one of the comments of part 1 Bombard Body lady/mentioned she cannot be trusted.  Not sure on that, I think she just might be bit of an idiot and using tube as a means of income.  That became clear when looking at her earlier assessment of trump family, all so loving, strong together ya da.  That dynamic has fallen apart by now with the displays of trump treating his 'model' wife as a minion.  Not that I feel sorry for her.  She knew what she wanted and what she was getting into when she made him her target.  Don't think she anticipated doing fotus however.  Can't hang out in her ivory tower and go on over the top shopping extravaganzas...now she lives under a microscope...karma is a bitch lol.  Bombard maybe sees what she wants or maybe she is disinfo...who knows.
           </p>
           <p>
            But...it is now clear as a bell (pun intended) that Bernard productions was just that...slick ad campaign plus injecting into the mass mind that banks can bring joy/which is such a crock it is laughable.  So is he just a slick promoter or more???  4 Inquiring minds...hummmm :)

            You could be onto something with this.  I am sitting on the edge of it now, but it could be a possibility.  Would not surprise me.  Also I believe the Crime Organizations of the World have combined together to push forward their agenda.  The Mafias have united.

            Yes, that's correct. To be more precise, the original House of Orange is no longer. The last legitimate king was
            <em>
             Willem van Oranje the First
            </em>
            . He was murdered by ascendants of the group that is now Minerva / party VVD. The zio-kike-khazars. They installed their own seizing power and continued to carry the House of Orange shield. I'll have to look up the research of a fellow dutchman that looked into this and unearthed a lot surrounding the history of our royalty.

            Twitter is a Dutch company. Did you all know that? Google has had a Dutch CEO since its founding. Yes, the Dutch are in the thick in the top elitist globalists hard-core.

            So, this paragraph could violate the Minerva rule?   Interesting.  It is also interesting that their analysis of Gaddafi is ass backwards.  The Libyan people were well taken care of, and that is why Gaddafi had to go.  If money is being spent on the Libyan people, then there is less money for the bankers to steal.
           </p>
           <p>
            "We have always said that the Qaddafi government's future is a matter for the Libyan people to decide, and they have made them selves clear. When a leader's only means of staying in power is to use mass violence against his own people, he has lost the legitimacy to rule and needs to do what is right for his country by leaving, and the sooner the better. Moammar Qaddafi has lost the confidence of his people and he should go without further bloodshed and violence. The Libyan people deserve a government that is responsive to their aspirations and that protects their universally recognized human rights."

             I think the Minerva "rule" spoken of is to formulate a postulate such way that the one to be eradicated (in this case Gaddafi) is presented to be the bad guy, sufficiently supported by public opinion, even if this public opinion is an illusion crafted by the perpetrators, where the perpetrators would and could be presented as the savior of said public (opinion), and as such, be made to look like intervention is legitimate by the will of the people.
            </p>
            <p>
             The same tactic is employed with Syria. Deep State instigation of resistance in Syria. To create the necessary "public opinion" and create the domestic "cry for external help" to legitimize intervention. But the tactic failed big-time in Syria, not in the least by Russian intervention on behalf of Bashar Assad, which is actually legitimate with respect to International Law.
            </p>
            <p>
             The paragraph does a fine enough job of such illusion craft to make it sellable at a global stage and as such would be Minerva-approved.

             The same also happend / happens in the Ukraine with the color-revolution sponsored by Soros that enabled the installment of the Neo-Nazi Porosjenko government which is a strong-arm of the same Zio-Satanic-Khazar-Kabbalah.

              Yes, I understand and agree with what you are saying.  Could Minerva be an organization?  Like the one on the 7th floor of the State Department?

               Yes, Minerva is an actual organization in the Netherlands:
               <a href="https://www.lsvminerva.nl/">
                https://www.lsvminerva.nl/
               </a>
               "The Oldest Society of The Netherlands". Don't be fooled by the glamorous front face of the website. I mean.. Free-masonry is all about good stuff too right? (sarcasm, until you get to the inner core).
              </p>
              <p>
               Hillary literrally acknowledges this group's go-ahead on the paragraph. I'm sure you know the USA is a corporation run by Great Britain, City of London. They do it together with the global Dutch Minerva elites. History is very important in this, as today is a culmination of the 16th and beyond century's British / Dutch Imperialism. And, they call it their "New World Order".

                 A side note, the sarcasm was not directed at you, but I don't think you took it that way. It was meant the typical comedy way in a generic fashion. :)

                <p>
                 Edit: as for the tax diversion, I don't know if that is the case, but I would not be surprised. Before the 18th century the churches held all the wealth. The Vatican was notable for this and can still be seen today. However, when western society developed, the movement of separation of State and Church gained traction, where in the 18th Amstel Rothschild took care of the wealth from a State perspective. They're basically servants to the Vatican. That's the head of the Snake (Black Nobility).

             Don't worry, this guy tried pulling the exact-same level of bait and switch shit on me, days ago.
            </p>
            <p>
             He told me he can't prove his claims, implying that the information was too sensitive and dangerous for me, a man who spends his entire life jumping down rabbitholes.
            </p>
            <p>
             Then in order to "prove me wrong", he tells me that I don't know what microwaves are, or how they work, despite my having a background in electrics.
            </p>
            <p>
             Then he tells me to google the current generation of Sonic/Ultrasonic weapons that the DoD and DARPA are developing, and, well, great, but that doesn't prove that Mr. ArtificialDuality has been attacked by nanites. He also seemed to imply that such a weapon could pick someone out of a crowd, which would imply that ESOTERICshade is the one with no understanding of waveforms, because if he did, he would know that it is impossible to focus and localize  what is, in essence, weaponized sounds, to one human body out of a group.

             The absolute best they have as a defense against scientific fucking reason, is to throw an ad hominem back, instead of providing proof, of which the burden lies with them, the claimants.

              See, now that makes a lot of sense to me. If they pretend to be really shitty shills on topics of less consequence, it masks their more effort-based shilling on things that ✡they✡ think really matter, like pedowood. Thanks for the anecdote!

            Holy crap that's fucking gold. Hillary has been pushed massively during US election time here as well, where Trump got painted as an asshole bigot all the way through.

            It has been known a while that the London / Amsterdam / Brussels triangle formed the home-base of the western Khazar maffia. Holland has been neck-deep into it. It goes way back to the 16th century with the emergence of the "Verenigde Oost-indische Compagnie (VOC)". Which is the Dutch elitist trade cartel that had its golden age in the 16th and 17th century and were leaders in slavery and colonism. (South Africa, Molukken, Sint Maarten, Curacau, Aruba). It's still alive and kicking today but nowadays is presented by Dutch multinationals like Shell, Unilever, ING and more.
           </p>
           <p>
            It's not just British Colonialism. The Dutch counter part which banded together with the Brits on this is not to be marginalized and or underestimated. Minerva could be seen as the organization that keeps it all tied together in the Dutch sphere.
           </p>
           <p>
            In fact, New York, was then, New Amsterdam, founded by the Dutch. When a vote for the national language was held, the vote on English slightly outpaced the vote for Dutch. Otherwise you Americans would most all be speaking Dutch =)
           </p>
           <p>
            They were Khazar descendants and Jews that had made their way to the US before labeled these fake-Jew immigrants "Kikes" because they signed their immigration letter with an "O" instead of a X as signature. The "O" in Hebrew is named "kike". Hence, "Kikes".
           </p>
           <p>
            That is why your e-mail link from Hillary Clinton is so important. It shows their servant status to this European Kike Cartel, the Zio-Satanic Kabbalah.

            No he can not be trusted. His two recordings were staged right at the time Holland became involved in PG (shortly after my posting about the Monster of Jura:

            The dead give-away for this hoax is the fact that the reporter started using words like "MK-Ultra" when Ronald didn't even talk about that. Ronald has already been exposed here in Holland by the network of Micha Kat :
            <a href="http://revolutionaironline.com/?s=Ronald">
             http://revolutionaironline.com/?s=Ronald
            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            The media clips were presented by a small company that also links stuff from David Icke, an automatic dis-info red-flag.
           </p>
           <p>
            While the Satanic crap is absolutely true (see first 2 links), this Ronald stuff has been designed to, in one fell swoop, render all allegations and research into the Satanic background of the pedophile epidemic null and void through exposure of fraud Ronald.
           </p>
           <p>
            Our country (Holland) is infested with (satanic) pedophilia through-out. The entire justice system is compromised. Government is compromised. All state services are compromised. They all have zio-satanics as their CEOs and head-honchos, protecting their Satansdom.
           </p>
           <p>
            The people are kept ignorant big-time (most Dutchies don't look beyond the dikes as a result of the language barrier (English)).
           </p>
           <p>
            Soros is the main player in this country when it comes to the leftist agenda controlling this country. He even had a meeting with Jesse Klaver of the "Left-green" party (Groen Links). Sorors is directly connected to Princess Mabel, a shady member of Dutch Royalty. All these zio-satanist males I talked about are all part of an "old-boys-club" called Minerva which is, like Free-Masonry a close knit elitist organization providing infrastructure. It's close to maffia. Well... it IS maffia. The company I work for has ties with this Minerva thing as well. They created an application for them. I haven't looked at it, but its available on their internal network. I would not be surprised if it's an app that Minerva members can order with stuff. I'm not gonna burn my fingers to this.

            also, with Joris Demmink at the top. This guy has full immunity and was recently cleared from any wrong-doing by the ultra-corrupt state of Holland. While this guy was known to order young boys from a boy-pimp named Karel. There's a witness, Yvonne Keuls that wants to testify, but DOJ is not doing ANYTHING with it:

             Have you seen these videos before?  He travels around France and Switzerland and documents the Pharaonic monuments.  Perhaps people can do the same in Belgium, Denmark, the Netherlands, etc.  It would be interesting to map out Europe and the U.S.

              Hi man,
             </p>
             <p>
              So far it seems stable though I have two pains, a muscle pain and a pain in my right lung. But the 2nd surgergy seems to have stopped the bleeding completely (deprieving some lung arteries from blood by having them embolized through an intravascular procedure). There's still the odd bits of blood that's dark colored. I suspect this to be remnants still coming up from the lungs. I'm still keeping tabs on it. It was quite daunting, this type of surgery twice, shortly one after another.
             </p>
             <p>
              I am home now since yesterday evening (local time) and am now recovering. I'm about to order the herbs people talked about and see if that adds any relief, I suspect it will.

              None of this comes into conflict with the physical reality of the universe. This is merely a discussion on conspiracy, webs of intrigue, and Talmudism. My complaint with your statements comes from your obvious delusions and lack of understanding of how the laws of physics actually work, as well as your inability to substantiate any of the relevant claims. I at no time questioned your statements or data on the global childfucker network.

               You are the one that is scientifically illiterate. I even posted various links from Science Daily that support the technology for synthetic telepathics. None of it violates any laws of physics. I AM a scientist in various fields. I am an Electronics Engineer. I'm an Information Science Engineer. I'm an aspirant Biology Student. I know my shit. You are the one without any argument and all baseless ranting. You are the one making yourself look totally stupid. What are you trying to do? So far you're a failure at your debunking. You are the type of scientist that, if it's not directly explainable through established, public science, that you scrub the questionmark and plug it with "if unresolvable then untrue". That's not the scientific approach. That is the agenda/coverup approach. Luckily, again, ScienceDaily provides all the leads towards STN being a very feasible tech today.
              </p>
              <p>
               You have to realize that the global childfucker network is of sectarian nature and uses technology a few notches up on what is publicly known. I have reverse engineered the existence of this S(ynthetic) (T)elepathic (N)etwork with collegues of the company I work for. The company I am talking about here having used the scientific method to deduct so. It's first-hand experience. Again, give me your e-mail and I supply you with all the transcripts of conversations had with co-workers and my confronting them with my gained knowledge and HAD IT CONFIRMED. They got scared and asked if I could read thoughts. I nodded. I have been able to since my 4th after turning to the Divine. This however is of biological nature. It's clearly distinguishable from the STN in how it is experienced.
              </p>

               The act of child fucking is purely evil. Where do you think the perps get their drives from? Yes, sources of Evil.

                 I guess you're new to nano tech. The technology is non-invasive in terms of classical surgery. It's not a big device or implant you get surgeoned in. You have to add a number of separate science tech fields together. Begin with "smart dust" "nano assemblage" "cellular payload" "bio electric interface" "DNA section electric channel". Put these search phrases into the Science Daily search engine.
                </p>
                <p>
                 In laymans terms: You ingest nano bots that hook up to the nerve system, settle themselves down in various locations in the body. They are nanoscale information adapters loaded with a small CPU and transceivers. Celltowers provide the digital comms with them. Think of them as having MAC addresses. The bots can read/write DNA for identification purposes. This is considered the "HAL" the hardware abstraction layer. The rest is software. The bots can read and transmit local EMF patterns that the brain then manifests back as spoken thought in one's mind. The volume is very low, but noticeable when focusing.
                </p>
                <p>
                 But to understand all of this, you will have to read a hand full of articles for each of the search phrases
                 <strong>
                  and actually understand what's being said
                 </strong>
                 .
                </p>
                <p>
                 Vault 7 contained documents that outlined connections between nano-bots and nerval cells. I'll have to look up that stuff again if it's still to be found. It shows an actual micro-scan of such a connection.
                </p>
                <p>
                 Furthermore, what I have uncovered at my work is the existence of the tech from a macro-level. The actual thoughts (those of my own and others), the spoken words and conversations with some members. The assholes have been mentally quarantining me (talking about me softly, false-profiling me to have unsuspect workers begin to evade me). All the while not giving me an opportunity to defend myself verbally at all. Well. I confronted some of them with what I heard of them, the gossip and again, HAD IT CONFIRMED. Elements in this were responses to of what I know to be my THOUGHTS exclusively, stuff I never spoke out verbally.

                    You have not proven that we are at a sufficient level of nanotechnology for 'them' to waste all of those resorces employing it on eomeone as unimportant as you.

                    What you did was provide blog posts and news articles that state this kind of thing can work, in theory. Until you get a blood panel that comes back positive for fucking nanites, you will sound less ludicrous.

                   It's not magic. I provided you with the means to obtain legitimate evidence of technological feats that can be used to create an STN. When you are the deepstate science department you're not gonna publish your tech to the public right? Luckily however, elements of the tech ARE documented and presented in a beneficial way, often in conjunction with desease fighting, like getting drug payloads into cancer tumors through nanobots tacked onto immune cells to transport the payload, for the payload to be released through an EM pulse. But then again, since you fight me so vehemently when anyone with an actual literate scientific mind can piece the puzzle together through sites such as Science Daily, I am pretty sure you have no clue about science, much less laws of physics, and are here with the intent to cover up any truth regarding all of this.

             Thank you! Great comment. I wish I could upvote it endlessly. Thank you for the links and the informations on Minerva. Minerva … isn't t hat a goddess? Looking like a spider or something? Anyways, totally going to take a closer look into your findings!

              It probably goes to Moloch in one way or another.  They use an owl statue at Bohemian Grove to represent Moloch.  Moloch gave wisdom in exchange for a child sacrifice.  The owl represents wisdom.
             </p>
             <p>
              It is a little too obvious to have a giant statue of Moloch.

               Yes, thanks for mentioning the Bohemian Gvove and the Owl.  The really odd thing about the owl statue is that it has a voice recording within it.  The voice is that of Walter Cronkhite.  Go figure.  There are connecting factors I believe all around the world to be found.

              Hi. I don't know about any double meaning of the word Minerva. But if it is to represent some Spider Deity, then that matches perfectly as they are the spider in the web controlling much every facet of Dutch operations (State / Corporate).

                She was the virgin goddess of music, poetry, medicine, wisdom, commerce, weaving, and the crafts.[3] She is often depicted with her sacred creature, an owl usually named as the "owl of Minerva",[4] which symbolised her association with wisdom and knowledge.
