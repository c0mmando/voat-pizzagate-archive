<p>EDIT 3 (cont.)- One of Ark’s trustee\' Bernard Sabrier also funded a charity called &quot;Children Action&quot; This charity has another partner- Bernard Kouchner- said to be involved in pedophile and organ trafficking rings. Here is a quote from the following link in relation to the trafficking of children by Zoe\'s ARK (of which Kouchner is involved)-</p>
<p>Deby made angry accusations that the children were being kidnapped for pedophile rings and organ transplants. The French Minister of Foreign Affairs, Bernard Kouchner, set up a crisis team headed by Rama Yade, Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs and Human Rights. She flew to Darfur and stated, &quot;We know absolutely nothing about how these children were gathered. We don’t know their origins, their nationality or the reality of their family situation. Taking them like this is in my view illegal and irresponsible.”</p>
<p>Sarkozy somewhat belatedly backed her up, and French police searched the Zoe’s Ark offices and Eric Breteau’s home. French supporters of Zoe’s Ark said they had been in the region for two months, and claimed that both Kouchner and Yade knew about and agreed with the operation.</p>
<p>Another company involved with Kouchner\'s Zoe\'s ARK- French Four Wheeled Drive Federation- joined with Zoe\'s ARK in \'04, presumably to supply the vehicles required to transport the children after the tsunami on Boxing Day. Their aim was to raise funds in France and work with the UN to create a village in Banda Aceh as a refugee for some of the 50k orphans thought to have been made so after the tsunami. The leaders were Guillaume Catala, one of the founders of ARK, and Eric Breteau, a former Fireman and president of the Four Wheeled Federation. Bernard Kouchner was also involved in the human organ market.</p>
<p>Edit 4: a random comment from a site I just found: re: Bowlby and attachment theory and how they studied it, and why. It’s been said they were looking, overall, at ways of breaking down the family and breaking down the parent-child bond. By “they” I mean social engineers, inspired by Freudian ideas, and Tavistock types like John Rawling Rees <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Rawlings_Rees">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Rawlings_Rees</a> who inspired Brock Chisholm and other globalists with the means at their disposal to put these theories into practice via the UN, and psychiatry. In Canada since 1945, there have been serial scandals and mass tragedies involving orphans ( e.g. Duplessis orphans), native residential school children, and Child Protection Services (Children’s Aid) taking children from “broken” or disadvantaged homes and making them wards of the state subject to all kinds of experimentation, drugging and sexual abuse.</p>
<p>Literally hundreds of thousands of children have been victimized in Canada alone — to what purpose? Is there an agenda to create a “new” type of human who grows up detached from parents and emotionally traumatized, making them more susceptible to social control and manipulation by media and all the other bombardments. And is that the ultimate goal of all this “social work” and endless “caring and compassion” — ? I forget where I’m going with this but it’s like the air we breathe and the soup we all swim in.</p>
