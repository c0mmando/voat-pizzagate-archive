            Yeah, I'm seeing the pattern. Flat Earth and Mandela Effect tainting the very worthwhile efforts to save children from abuse, rape, and murder. Some may beg to differ, but whenever I find something promising exposing the Jesuits and the Vatican, somehow they turn out to be Flat Earth. It's very frustrating! LOL...

            Eh. Let's not mix conspiracy with fact. Pizzagate is absolutely factual with many strands of evidence weaved in this dark web of human trafficking. The earth is flat and other conspiracies should be posted about elsewhere. Our cause is to stop this atrocity from continuing. The rest is just a distraction.

            Thanks, for the intent on your words. I don't mean to turn people off to the ideas I bring forward - it is frustrating to deal with so many people not investigating on one-hand and yet seemingly trying to investigate on the other.

            I'm so sure....."Flat earth".   The earth being a ball isn't just a theory taught in school.  There are men who go up into outer space.  Look, on that last mission out to Mars they took a video from up in their space ship....over a million miles away from earth.  Everybody in the comments over at NASA dot gov loves the amazing footage. Then you have a few idiot conspiracy theorists who don't believe its a real video taken from way up in outer space of our earth.....the uneducated types usually.

             I've never heard of the flat Earth theory.  Can you give me a starting point?  What is the benefit of us thinking it's a globe?  Just curious.

              I suppose the theory is basically the lucifarians created a massive lie we live on a globe and came from evolution.  Their message is "There is no God". I agree its rather magnificent to believe anyone would do that, or that it could be done.
             </p>
             <p>
              At one time, well for most of humanity's existence....everyone did think the earth was flat, but according to modern education, people back then thought you would fall off the edge.  With some research you will see that is a lie, people did not think you would fall off the edge.  Congruent among independent cultures, the earth was charted as flat and circular, their charting was used to navigate accurately by for thousands of years.  Makes you wonder, why is the previous conception kept hidden?  If nothing else, its a novelty how ingeniously everyone had it figured, but not even the most educated have any knowledge of that model or that conception of our earth...its simply not taught...and not a single mention in any science or history shows on TV....or books in public or academic libraries.
             </p>
             <p>
              As proof, the flat earther's say that the curvature of the earth which should occur if the earth were a sphere 24,901 miles in circumference, simply doesn't exist; it is not present or observable....and they are correct in that.  There is some obscurity with what can be seen from the surface at distance, but without a doubt, land masses or buildings across large bodies of water are visible when they should be "over the horizon" if the earth were the sphere we are taught it is.
             </p>
             <p>
              There's also the aspect of NASA imagery, which yes is all fake.  That can no longer be argued.  Simple analysis of their works shows blatant and obvious Hollywood magic and fake imagery.
             </p>
             <p>
              The "lucifarian" aspect of it is apparent with many figures involved with the implementation of the globe earth model, its proofs and its proliferation; also being admitted Satanists.  Jack Parson's is a good example with open admission of his satanic practices alongside Alister Crowley.   Albert Pike is another good example of open admission.
             </p>
             <p>
              Then there's the programming.  Schools teach the globe from kindergarten on.  Seems modern basic math textbooks are more bent on showing the planets spinning than on teaching basic math skills.  In many of the shows on TV from childhood cartoons to adult sitcoms...there's scripting to strengthen belief in the globe, and/or cast the notion anyone who thinks the earth is flat is crazy or stupid.
             </p>
             <p>
              Its just hard to comprehend a ruse so vast.  But apparently if it is a ruse, with those behind the ruse worshiping the father of all lies and practiced in the art of deception.  There's no doubt NASA is 100% fraud and taking 20 billion a year in tax dollars.  As far as if the earth is flat or not...well its demonstrably true the surface does not curve as professed.   As far as gravity and all that other science.... it can be argued to no end, but never actually proven.  The globe earth was an unproven theory up until NASA's fake stuff, evolution is still an unproven theory, gravity also is an unproven theory...but they are all taught as fact.
             </p>
             <p>
              Like I said, the message of all that science is "there is no God".  That was the name of a recent Stephen Hawking documentary even.  Or you can catch famed astrophysicist Lawrence Krauss at his college lectures...after he gets done explaining how the universe began with an exploding star....he uses his punchline "Forget Jesus!  Thank a star for dying so you could be here!" Or Bill Nye the actor was live on scene at the opening of a City's Noah's Ark exhibit, screaming "its child abuse to teach the bible".
             </p>
             <p>
              With all the talk that's been on the internet about these matters, they ran a show on TV where Stephen Hawking set up a laser on a lake, ran a boat out three miles on the lake to show the laser rose 6 feet as it should on the ball earth.   Well, that was on TV....maybe go check that out yourself in real life.  Nowadays there are some good cameras.  Use his math and apply it to a far away shore....if you can see the waves crashing on the shore 10+ miles away....then the earth is not a ball.
             </p>
             <p>
              But I suppose if people can believe a quadriplegic writes books on astrophysics and speaks fluently through a computer voice by wiggling his cheek, then they can believe we're living on a ball spinning at over 1,000 mph, while circling the sun 93 million miles away at over 50,000 mph.....the sun itself with all balls in tow is circling the center of our milky way galaxy at over half a million miles per hour.....and the entire milky way with everything in it is moving along at over 1 million miles per hour through infinite space.  And every star in the sky is a sun in its own galaxy constantly undergoing similar motions.......yeah, ok, that's why our sky remains the same always.  The old model with a fixed set of stars above us rotating around the central pole star or "North Star", sun and moon circling and planets each having their own paths in the dome above us....lines up with reality much better.  The North Star has not moved since its position began being recorded....and yet we are to believe both it and we are moving millions and millions of miles per day in various directions?  lol
             </p>
             <p>
              The big hurdle is realizing such a big ruse is even possible...but it is what it is.   Sorry, this guy is not a scientist up in outer space.  He is an actor here on earth on studio set.  NASA = Disney for adults. Snap out of it.

              Oh.. don't go looking to the "flat earth society" for a starting point. From what I can see, that's controlled opposition.  Just like right now, the mainstream media and the force behind it are making tons of fake news sites online.  I wont' get into explaining how all that works in the art of "witch craft" that those at the heart of it practice.

              You trying to say this guy isn't a scientist living up in outer space?  That he's really just a performer here on earth in a studio set?

              No way, that's crazy conspiracy talk.  Outer space is so amazing.  There's no way they could fool the public by launching rockets out of sight over the ocean then switching to Hollywood magic.

            I'm pretty sure that, at this point, the only people stories like this really serve to convince are those who already have their minds made up and wish to have their confirmation bias tickled. We all are subject to confirmation bias to some degree. Even those of us who KNOW Pizzagate is 100% true. However, the primary difference between us and them is...we're right!

            You can't have it both ways. You can't quote bullshit websites when they agree with you and then quote others when they're just as shitty as yours.

            You are an idiot if you think the Earth is a spinning globe. The Earth is Flat, wake up and do some research before you open your mouth and start bullshitting about the presumptions you were fed all your life and are tempted to start regurgitating.

            You can check my YouTube channel, I'm posting here and on YouTube under my REAL name - I graduated from Stony Brook with a bachelor's degree in computer science. The world is definitely not a spinning ball.

Not that there's any such thing as a plateau on planet of Earth. Oh, wow, how are we able to see the phases of the moon? Yeah, a flat earth would surely cast that shadow.

                   Yeah, like that other person said, you insult people right away, that doesn't make people want to listen to your disinfo. Keep insulting me and you will just improve the case that Flat Earth and the Mandela Effect believers are stupid, crazy, and most importantly, victims of a psy-op, made to taint the pursuit of worthwhile things on this GLOBE EARTH that affect us on a serious level : our children.

              The Mandela Effect is absolutely real, it is authenticated by me. I testify here in this very forum that the Mandela effect is a very real phenomenon. 
Are you going to tell me that the Fruit of the Loom logo never had a cornucopia?

              Its alot more than a simple prank, the world administrators are putting you on notice of very heavy manipulation of this world yet moreover a lack of respect for your sentimentality beyond words to describe. You are not being considered to be a "real sentient" you are being considered as a robot, and a "passing thought" in the pov of this system. Sentients have to be respected, robots don't - that's why Pizzagate and the levels of abuse that happen are being allowed to happen.

            While obviously another valiant effort to discredit our movement... I will say that it seems to an ever so slight vibe of "this theory is fake, but we don't want to completely SLAM it as we may have to eat our words in the future..."

            IDK call me crazy but that was my take away from the article.  I mean they print the words "PSYOP" in the body.  I know I am reaching hard here folks but its a start!

             Meet the Cavaliers Conspiracy Stars: Andrew ‘Pizzagate’ Bogut and Kyrie ‘Flat Earth’ Irving - The Daily Beast
            </p>

            'When it comes to Pizzagate, like Bogut, Grinberg isn’t exactly sure what the true nature of the conspiracy is, but he’s sure that something is going on. '
           </p>
           <p>
            'As the criticism mounted, Bogut found a friendly reporter to reject any connections to white nationalism. '
           </p>
           <p>
            'Libertarian or right-wing bent notwithstanding, at some point Bogut was radicalized, and in 2016, he began following a slew of alt-right Twitter accounts. '
           </p>
           <p>
            ' As evidence, Grinberg noted that he’d made similar injury predictions about Dwight Howard and Gilbert Arenas that came true. '
           </p>
           <p>
            'That said, he never actually went so far as to call Pizzagate a ridiculous fever dream. '
