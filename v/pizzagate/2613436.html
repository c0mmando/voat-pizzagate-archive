<p>Reports of a Mexico child organ trafficking ring emerged in 2014 when authorities suspected the Knights Templar cartel of kidnapping children and harvesting their organs for sale on the black market. Human organ trafficking is an issue in many developing countries where people are tricked into selling, and even donating, kidneys and other body parts. These organs are sold to wealthy foreigners who desperately need them.</p>
<p>An Orphanage Was A Primary Location For The Children Organ Trafficking Scheme</p>
<p>The Home of the Big Family was a respected orphanage in Zamora, Mexico. That is until authorities raided the orphanage in 2014 and discovered that over 500 children were being kept against their will in cramped conditions.</p>
<p>The orphanage, also known as the Casa de Mama Rosa, had been open for 40 years. Because of the guilt around the establishment doing the work the government was unable to do, inspections of the facility were notoriously lax</p>
<p>...............</p>
<p>Some Harvested Organs Were Likely Used For Witchcraft</p>
<p>Some of the organs harvested from children in Mexico might be used for witchcraft and satanic purposes. Bodies found with their livers and hearts brutally removed are proof of this according to Dr. Lopez-Neblima, a surgeon at a Mexican hospital. He claimed that organs that were clearly removed with no delicacy were likely not intended for transplant use. Instead, the organs were probably for Santa Muerte (Saint Death) rituals. </p>
<p>.........</p>
<p>Trucks With The Frozen Bodies Of Children Were Early Indications Of The Trafficking Ring</p>
<p>An earlier event hinting at the increasing child organ trafficking crisis faced by Mexico involved a truck at a checkpoint in Villa Victor-Chinicuila, Mexico. Authorities searched the truck and found dozens of frozen bodies with their organs removed. Some were children and others were adults but all were dead. The story gets hazy from there as the truck disappeared after the police arrived.</p>
<p>In another case, a truck stopped in Tierra Caliente also had bodies with missing organs in it. The bodies were confiscated, but again, no follow-up was reported. Early indications that Mexican police didn\'t take it seriously that an organ trafficking ring was on the rise. </p>
<p>........</p>
<p>Children Kidnapped On The Way To The Beach Were Found In A Refrigerated Box</p>
<p>In 2014, a group of children from Mexico City were kidnapped by members of the Knights Templar cartel. Their parents had given them permission to go on the beach outing with their school. The children never made it to the beach. Luckily, a stolen van was intercepted when it made it a wrong turn and ended up in the city of Tepalcatepec, Mexico. In the back of the van, the children were found in a refrigerated box. Thankfully, they were wrapped in blankets and still alive. Authorities believe that the kids were on their way to an ocean side port owned by the cartel where their organs would likely have been harvested. </p>
<p>.......</p>
<p>Four Children Were Kidnapped On Their Way To School And Later Found Buried In A Shallow Grave</p>
<p>In 2014, four children were walking to school in Mexico when they vanished into thin air. Days later, their bodies were found in a shallow grave in an undisclosed location. According to sources, the children had been disturbingly mutilated - their chest organs had been removed prior to their burials. The story was hushed up with almost no trace of it appearing anywhere. Officials from that part of Mexico claimed that there was no proof of organ harvesting in the case despite the very telling details regarding missing organs. </p>
<p>.......</p>
<p>U.S. Doctors Perpetuate Trafficking By Not Questioning Where Organs Come From</p>
<p>The demand for organs is never ending, especially in the U.S. That demand has led to some doctors breezing over any kind of investigation into where organs are coming from before performing procedures. The lack of protocol and desire to take more people off the donor registry lists has led the cartel to traffic more and more. </p>
<p>.......</p>
<p>Children Are Preyed Upon When Attempting Safe Travel To The United States</p>
<p>These kids are preyed upon by human traffickers who sell them into slavery, prostitution, or who harvest their organs, leaving their bodies in shallow graves or out in the open</p>
<p>....</p>
<p>The Kidnapped Children Are Profiled For Specific Traits</p>
<p>According to sources, the children kidnapped for organ trafficking fit a specific profile that the kidnappers look for. They are after kids who fit certain physical characteristics, such as height and weight, possibly to match organ recipients</p>
<p>......</p>
<p>The Knights Templar Cartel Switched From Drug Trafficking To Organ Trafficking</p>
<p>The crime ring split from the Familia Michoacana cartel in 2011 and is suspected of being heavily involved in child organ trafficking, as well as extortion, and illegal mining and logging. Prior to this, the cartel\'s main source of income was in drug trafficking.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Organ Trafficking Usually Focuses On Kidney Harvesting, But Children\'s Hearts And Livers Are Being Removed</p>
<p>What\'s unusual about the Mexico child organ harvesting cases is the fact that the children are found with their hearts and livers removed.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Child Organ Trafficking Reports Go Back Many Years To Guatemala In 1994</p>
<p>Back in 1994, reports emerged of mobs attacking children and removing their organs for transplanting, killing them in the process. Although some people believed that the stories were made up for political gain in order to make the country seem unstable, seemingly credible eyewitnesses claimed to have seen the evidence themselves</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Very Few Feel Safe Enough To Speak Up To Authorities About The Trafficking</p>
<p>One such person, who identified herself to a reporter as &quot;Camila&quot; pointed out that going to the police is just as dangerous as confronting the &quot;bad people&quot; since the cops are usually either involved with the cartels or paid off by them to look the other way.</p>
<p>A researcher for Amnesty International agreed with this sentiment and pointed out the questionable police work done by authority figures, many of whom are afraid of angering the cartels. This leads to few places for parents to turn when their children get abducted by organ traffickers. </p>

              IMPORTANT, READ THIS QUOTE:

            “The all kidnapped children have been the children from the Mexico City schools whose blood samples have been directed to the drug cartel members through the one school member, usually one who was enough paid to share the important and clarified data with the third parties. Mexico has a very sensible social atmosphere now, ruined by poverty and tensions among classes. The rich and the poor. The corrupted layers of the government in between. You can not count on your police to protect you or to save you because they are all colored by drug money as an award for “good job” and “closed eyes” on cartel’s crime. But you can maybe count on the Christian militia:”
           </p>
           <p>
            Why is a school asking for blood samples of all the kids in the first place. No one should consent to this. This is the problem with that 23 and Me garbage handing over your complete DNA for them to do as they please. They know your location where to find you and your health, blood type, etc.

             While looking for info on Mexican schools i am finding a lot of articles referring to high lead levels in Mexico city school children. Maybe this is how they obtain the blood samples. The old "schools filled with lead; now we need to check your kids blood" routine

             realized this post had things to look into
            </p>
            <p>
             someone tried to find school
            </p>
            <p>
             was hoping all would help looking into it
            </p>
            <p>
             gonna look myself on a few thing
            </p>
            <p>
             what comes to mind on blood tests, DNA, are those with negative blood
            </p>
            <p>
             they say only 15 % to 17 % of population has it
            </p>
            <p>
             most of the Rothschild Cabal are negative
            </p>
            <p>
             most of are presidents negative with Clinton and Obama AB negative, which is 1% of the negative or the population, forgot which
            </p>
            <p>
             would think it would be difficult to find negative organs
            </p>
            <p>
             gonna look for school and testing children in Northwestern Mevico
            </p>
            <p>
             they mentioned cities in articles, its a start

            If all the reports of organ harvesting are true it seems there has to be uses other than transplants for them.  I mean how many people do you know who have had a transplant.  OK this site says 95 a day
            <a href="https://optn.transplant.hrsa.gov/">
             https://optn.transplant.hrsa.gov/
            </a>
            which would be 34,000 per year in the US.  And maybe when the indiscriminately harvest from trafficked people etc they can't use them all, but it does seem to me that something else is going on.  Witchcraft...who knows, happens elsewhere, wouldn't put it past some of the perverts in this country

             think maybe Rich people have transplants more than we know

            <p>
             how do we know he didn't have a transplant?
            </p>
            <p>
             also, How many foreigners come here for transplants?
            </p>
            <p>
             it's gotten so expensive here, that transplants are now done in other countries
            </p>
            <p>
             when you look at number sites for transplants, they don't add up, and are they really truthful?
            </p>
            <p>
             we know numbers of missing kids aren't true, would surprise me transplant numbers aren't true either
            </p>
            <p>
             great story on Uganda, started of looking into Israel, theres some bad transplanting stories there, but came across this article and had to put it up
            </p>
            <p>
             Think we can wake a lot of people up with Child organ trafficking, well maybe not a totally wake up but its a good start
            </p>
            <p>
             not sure how we can do it in one post though, don't think we can, maybe a few posts
            </p>
            <p>
             but just think of the amount of people we can grab their attention :)

             links are still coming in Vin
            </p>
            <p>
             don't have room in this post, but the PGers are coming up with good questions and great links
            </p>
            <p>
             we still have some looking to do, but maybe I can pull it all together into a new post with everyones input
            </p>
            <p>
             I'm so proud at the questions and links
            </p>
            <p>
             Can only use so many words in a post
            </p>
            <p>
             will see what I can do, in the mean time going to help dig some more
            </p>
            <p>
             I would like this to get out to all, but you should understand, will hold off, get more info from the GR8 people here, then try to fit it all in a post

            This is beyond disturbing, but thanks for your hard work bringing it to our attention. I had never heard of this cartel before. They seem exceptionally nasty.

             think have said everything about this topic. What more can I say? Falls on deaf ears. Everytime this topic comes close to exploding, there's some retarded media planted nonsense like the false flag newspaper shooting and other obvious fake crap occurring this week.

              Another rapper got killed again and somebody else too.  Am too busy to get so wrapped up in rappers, it all is gone quickly and another dies.  Not betting since I totally agree. :)

                I up voted you, what more do you want? I am working on this particularly sickening subject. Just putting past references in punk into perspective, since the punk movement was mostly started by the CIA.

            Manuel Plancarte Gaspar, 34, was captured last week in a stolen car that was also carrying crystal meth, one of the cartel's top sellers in the international drug trade. He was captured in the western state of Michoacan, where the Knights Templar rule and terrorize the citizenry.
           </p>
           <p>
            In an unusual series of Twitter posts, Michoacan's Public Safety Secretary Carlos Castellanos Becerra announced the arrest of Gaspar "who belongs to a criminal group and is being investigated for the death of children, who drew their organs for sale."

               As the name suggests, these narcos are inspired by the Jerusalem-based crusaders who fought in the name of Christ between 1119 and 1312, at which point the Pope disbanded them. But unlike their medieval idols, these thugs cook up methamphetamines, or crystal meth, and have left scores of mutilated corpses strewn about Michoacan since their emergence as a group in March.

                  I don't have links but it's the same group. The only thing is that the winners of wars get to write the history books so we get the sanitized version where it's a conspiracy theory to suggest these things have been going on since then. Perhaps if we fail at ending this problem one day the templar we speak of now will be referred to with the historical respect that most bestow upon the past templar now.

               Reminds me where Ronald Bernard the Whistleblower says that the people at the top, (probably referring to people like the Rothschilds, the Killarys etc) do these satanic rituals and enjoy the pain, suffering and destruction of any normal person/situation. 
I knew this goes on but it is really hard to get my mind around it, as a normal human being. These sickos have no soul, no conscience, no regard for anyone except themselves, and they ENJOY the downfall of normallity because they have the power to destroy, as simple as that!

             Thanks a BUNCH. I can use this info down here...
            </p>
            <p>
             The only thing I have on hand is my old post. It gives some old news links and background on trafficking in Mexico, with some general info about crime and politics.
            </p>

            </p>
            <p>
             One story still sticks out: victims and witnesses that came forward to report trafficking were arrested and charged with trafficking and got sent to pirison. It’s still talked about.
            </p>
            <p>
             Also, there are a couple of towns mentioned in the videos, infamous for trafficking, beyond just Tijuana, and Juarez (a murderers playground). There has been a lot of talke about the gangs on the border of McCallen Texas.
            </p>
            <p>
             Also, currently Mexico is gearing up for a presidential election. It’s a weird one, and there is a lot of debate about a socialist candidate. The other candidates are variously corrupt or just mudslinging, etc.

            Child organ trafficking ring busted by Mexican police
           </p>
           <p>
            Police in Mexico's western state of Michoacan detained an alleged member of the Knights Templar cartel who is suspected of kidnapping children to harvest their organs, an official said Monday.
           </p>
           <p>
            Michoacan state Public Safety Secretary Carlos Castellanos Becerra alleged that Manuel Plancarte Gaspar was part of the cartel's organ-trafficking ring. The ring would kidnap children and take them to rented homes with medical equipment where their organs were removed, Castellanos Becerra charged.
           </p>
           <p>
            "We have several statements in open investigations that point to a network of several suspects who would identify people with certain characteristics, especially children, and kidnap them," he said.
           </p>
           <p>
            Castellanos Becerra said the cases go back several years, but he said he couldn't give any specific details or discuss evidence because the investigation is still open.
           </p>
           <p>
            Plancarte Gaspar, 34, was detained last week along with another suspect in a stolen car. The men also had some crystal meth, Castellanos Becerra said. He said Plancarte Gaspar is the nephew of Enrique Plancarte Solis, a top Knights Templar leader.
           </p>
           <p>
            Hours before the announcement, a leader of one of the local vigilante groups that sprang up last year in Michoacan to challenge the cartel's control told a radio station that people in the area knew the Knights Templar gang was involved in organ trafficking because several children had been rescued in his town while being transported in a refrigerated container inside a van.
           </p>
           <p>
            "They were inside a refrigerated box, tightly wrapped in blankets," Dr. Jose Manuel Mireles, leader of the civilian "self-defense" group in Tepalcatepec, said in a morning interview with MVS radio.
           </p>
           <p>
            Mireles said the van carrying the children was headed to the port city of Lazaro Cardenas and ended up in Tepalcatepec after making a wrong turn.
           </p>
           <p>
            "They were all children from the same Mexico City school," he said.
           </p>
           <p>
            He said the children's parents had allowed them to go on an outing to the beach when they were likely kidnapped. He said the children were turned over to their parents who traveled to Tepalcatepec.
           </p>
           <p>
            Mireles didn't say when the children were rescued and didn't answer his cellphone Monday.
           </p>
           <p>
            Mexican authorities have said drug trafficking is no longer the top source of income for the Knights Templar, which was once a top producer of crystal meth. The officials say the cartel's main sources of income are illegal mining, illegal logging and extortion.

              There is prob a good reason it is not mentioned.  People are scared out of their wits down there.  I have a friend and he still goes down there, and he verifies what it says in the article.  They do not get involved fearing for their lives and their children's lives.  I read 3 dif articles it and did not see a name.

                Horrible.  MS-13 Copy Cats.  I think these are the ones that hijacked that bus with the Missing 26 College Students.  I think they eventually found what was left.  Even the teeth were powder. Yeah, folks coming to a hood near you if you don't spread the word and STOP THIS INSANITY.
