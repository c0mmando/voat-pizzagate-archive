            Yes, that's what is being asked of you, and this goes back to Baby Burlesque as far as American culture goes.

            Yeah, those are way too racy for a 15yo, however; I would like to point out that she is too old for a true pedophile.   They abandon their victims once they reach puberty.  Just wanted to point this out to highlight how heinous the Pizzagate topic is.
           </p>
           <p>
            I do agree that Hollywood, the media and the fashion industry sexualize girls and young women way too early, most likely in an effort to normalize it.

            She looks just like mom. This has been going on for at least 30 years, though. Just pick up any teen magazine and there are bikini, lingerie etc shots of underage models. Cindy herself was a teen model, if I remember right.

            They always start the girls off as young sex objects. Hillary Duff, Amanda Bynes, Selena Gomez,Miley Cyrus, Chloe Moretz, Elle/Daktoa Fanning, Kendal/Kylie Jenner... Always before 18 they're turned into sex objects, and it progresses to a hyper sexual level.

             I have always had the feeling Amanda Bynes was a victim. Brittney Spears as well. I know both have genuine mental health issues but I wonder if those issues did not come from medicating them to keep them silent.
            </p>
            <p>
             I work in mental health, not in California where BS  or NYC where AB got their conservatorships in place though, and can say from experience it is tough to get that granted. I have seen clients in much worse condition wait a year to get one granted to a family member and three years to get one for a lawyer or legal guardian. I know money makes these things go faster but it moved way to too fast in both of these cases. Could be a state thing or the fact that their issues were publicized that made it move faster.

             When you think of children, particularly girls in hollywood, I have a hard time coming up with a child  actor who ended up happy and healthy. Really I can only think of Hillary duff and Natalie Portman who seem to be going great. 
You have the Olsen girls, britney spears and her sister who got pregnant very young, lindsay lohan and her sister and Amanda bynes who crashed hard. Brittney Murphy also died under strange circumstances and she claimed she had info on something, don't remember what exactly but she had an older very unattractive husband who seems very controlling. If I recall correctly, he also died from the same mystery illness a while later. Interestingly, they lived in a house Britney spears and Justin Timberlake lived in.
            </p>
            <p>
             The olsen girls had issues and seemd to get over the eating disorder problems which is great but the both have a strange thing for much older men. I mean I get liking older guys because you grew up fast and are business ladies but they are to the extreme.
            </p>
            <p>
             Side note: I am on mobile and cannot link to things. I remember a great vanity fair article some years back about somebody Pearlma who set up all the late 90's American boybands. He was a creeper and the article was shocking. I then heard a guy, I forgot his name, who was on Howard Stern talking about this.man and how one guy from each band basically was used for sex to have them become famous. I forgot the man's name who was talking to Howard about it but I remember he had childhood cancer that came back in his late 20's/early 30's and he ended up dying from it. His name may have been Richie. I have no reason to doubt a word this man said.

             I have often wondered if any of the girls on 7th heaven were victims of the father on the show. Again the name escapes me and I am writing this while in a boring meeting so I cannot look this up right now. Just putting this out there to add to it and edit it later when I am not being bored to death slowly by people who think they are overly important.

              What a great response and you are not boring anyone. This is such a good read. Lou Pearlman was the Backstreet Boys + NSYNC manager. Pedophile freak who conveniently died a few months ago. I wondered about the 7th Heaven girls as well, Jessica Biel etc. Hillary Duff and Natalie Portman are very fucked up, don't think they are not!n Hillary was sending naked pictures of herself to anyone when she was 14. Natalie Portman worked with known Hollywood pedophile Dan Schneider when she was 14 and you can probably figure out the rest. She is Israeli and probably has a lot more protection than the average starlet in her now adult life.

               TBH, I know very little about Hillary and Natalie so I was assuming incorrectly that they had gotten out unscathed. At this point though, not ending up with a psych hold by 25 is a positive ending.

               Yeah. I realized that after I typed it out that I did not mention boy actors only girl child stars. I have a feeling he was very sheltered as we as the Harry potter boy.

             I hear that, KanyeMKUltra (lol at your username) I just haven't seen anything so
             <strong>
              BLATANT
             </strong>
             as this before on the front page of MSM. I don't recall pics of Hillary Amanda, Britney Miley etc cavorting around when they were
             <strong>
              15
             </strong>
             <em>
              <em>
               ...
              </em>
              15
             </em>
             is the kicker here. Even Miley was
             <strong>
              over 21
             </strong>
             when she started up her hooker act. 
Again, the onus here is on
             <strong>
              Kaia being 15
             </strong>
             and a mother who should know better. (That said, Ive never trusted Cindy, even though she's apparently americas supermodel sweetheart.)

                That's true. I remember the Miley thing when it happened though, and I'm not exactly a big Miley fan haha so it definitely hit mainstream media.

               Miley has to be an abuse victim. She screams it (figuratively) in every one of her gross videos. Very sad.

                Without giving myself away, I had a parent that was a road crew member working around the Cyrus family when Billy Ray first came onto the scene, and Miley was just a toddler. Those kids, without any doubt, including her brother and sister, were brought up as merely tokens or objects to be used at will by both parents. Her mother is not a woman I would respect or trust with a goldfish let alone a child, and her father, well, I hate to say this, but he's a backwoods country bumpkin that had too much power and money given to him early on. Those kids have had to go at things on their own pretty much from the get go.

                 Thanks so much for sharing, shortymcbosspants! The entire Cyrus family are totally hickey, no? Im so happy there are so many different folks on Voat, sharing their stories. It really gives me hope that eyes are opening and minds are awakening. Ive been witness to some insane antics, involving the 'power elite' but in the past, nobody believes it. Powerful PR magnets were once everything, keeping scandals under the radar. Thank god for our current times.
