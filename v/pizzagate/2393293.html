<h1></h1>
<p>But it doesn\'t stop there.</p>
<p>There\'s also an opinion piece by <em>The Guardian</em>\'s art critic (who some time ago argued in favour of a painting of Balthus, creator of pedophile art, at the MoMa).</p>
<p><strong>\'Marina Abramovic: the latest target in the rightwing culture wars\'</strong> <em>(I\'m always rolling on the floor when I read that Pizzagate is solely a rightwing investigation....)</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>...an accusation that artist Marina Abramović has been schooling senior Democrats in black magic</strong> is almost a welcome bit of light relief.</p>
<p>How did avant-garde art star Abramović get involved in America’s most corrosive election season? </p>
<p>Her name appears in the emails of John Podesta, chairman of Hillary Clinton’s presidential campaign, which have been released by WikiLeaks. In one of the messages, she invites Podesta’s art-collector brother, Tony, to “a spirit cooking dinner at my place” and says John would be welcome, too.</p>
<p><strong>...this story about art, satanism and conspiracy theories is just another window on what has gone wrong with democracy.</strong> </p>
<p><strong>When you define those who disagree with you not just as political opponents but satanic acolytes of darkness, you are committed to a politics of unreason, intolerance and hate.</strong></p>
