<p>With the &quot;EPSTEIN DIDNT KILL HIMSELF&quot; meme bringing this story back in the limelight, perhaps they are attempting to control the narrative. Let\'s make sure they get it right. According to the flight info he could be alive and well, 30,000 ft up.

<p>Can anyone find any data on his jets anymore? Could this mean Lolita Express is still flying?</p>
<p>This is an ALERT for anyone following this flight data, to review, compile and archive, what you have, because They want it gone. </p>

            <p>
             The Gulfstreams are a different story. The IV is registered to JEGE, LLC and has the tail number N120JE. corporations were established in the U.S. Virgin Islands, and share an address with Epstein's office in St. Thomas. The same address previously appeared on Epstein's entry in New York's sexual offender registry address and in filings for at least two of his non-profit concerns, the C.O.U.Q. Foundation and the J. Epstein Virgin Islands Foundation. Furthermore, their flight patterns clearly suggest they were used by someone who splits their time between Epstein's properties.
            </p>
            <p>
             Between January 2018 and June 2019, the Gulfstream IV flew 57 flights. That suggests one or both jets were airborne a minimum of 1 out of every 3 days. (Data before 2018 appears to be unavailable.)
            </p>
            <p>
             Predictably, the bulk were flown between airports near Epstein's homes in Palm Beach, Manhattan, Paris, and the US Virgin Islands. One of the last recorded flights, a red-eye between Le Bourget Airport near Paris and Teterboro Airport in New Jersey, aligns with reports that Epstein was arrested at Teterboro on July 6 upon his return from France.
            </p>
            <p>
             Epstein's Gulfstream jets flew to Slovakia, Mexico, and the United Kingdom — sometimes for only a few hours
            </p>
            <p>
             The same flight data gathered by ADSBExchange places Epstein's jets in a number of other countries and cities:
            </p>
            <p>
             On January 23, 2018, the Gulfstream IV flew from Paris to London, and returned two days later.
            </p>
            <p>
             On April 8, 2019, the Gulfstream IV flew from Atlanta to Cabo San Lucas, Mexico, and returned five days later.
            </p>
            <p>
             On Thursday, Epstein's legal team informed a federal judge that their client currently owns only one jet, having sold his second one in June 2019. That likely explains why the older Gulfstream IV was flying between the US Virgin Islands and Atlanta on the same day of its former owner's arrest. Epstein intends to put up the newer model as collateral for bail. It was last spotted yesterday, when it flew from New Jersey to an airfield near Savannah, Georgia.

            Hmmm. I think disinfo is being pushed here, though I'm not sure who is driving it. Not saying you are, OTI.
           </p>
           <p>
            First,
            <a href="https://archive.is/WaI70">
             the alleged "Antarctica" trip on 7/23/2019 does not look like a real flight path
            </a>
            . Note that the reported locations are all in the Caribbean, except for one red dot in Antarctica.
           </p>
           <p>
            Second, according to
            <a href="https://www.insider.com/jeffrey-epsteins-private-jet-flight-data-2019-7">
             this article
            </a>
            published shortly before the alleged 7/23/2019 flight, the flight tracker site is sourced by "enthusiasts" who track planes with their own equipment:
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             Most flights can be tracked in real time by anyone in the world. Epstein, however, has long taken advantage of a little-known federal policy that permits the owners of private jets to conceal their real-time movements from public view. At the same time, most aircraft are programmed to automatically broadcast their unique "tail number," speed, and current location using a system known as automatic dependent surveillance-broadcast, or ADS-B. (This system will become mandatory in 2020.)
            </p>
            <p>
             Anyone with the appropriate (and relatively inexpensive) equipment can pick up and record ADS-B signals from aircraft passing overhead. Over the last few years, thousands of avionics hobbyists have submitted their data to the website ADSBExchange, resulting in detailed maps that show the paths of otherwise blocked aircraft, including both of Epstein's Gulfstreams. While the site provides the data for free, its owner requests donations from commercial entities that make use of it. INSIDER provided such a donation before publishing this article.
            </p>
           </blockquote>
           <p>
            All it would take for someone to make up that flight path is to upload one false report showing him in Antarctica, which is FAR more probable than the an "enthusiast" who happens to be tracking Epstein's blocked plane manually from the ground being in Antarctica to spot his plane.
           </p>
           <p>
            I can think of two reasons the flight data site has closed viewing of data. One, it doesn't want to be deplatformed for fueling "conspiracy theories" leading to "crazed attacks" like 8chan was, or two, it's a stunt to get people to pay for access to the site.
           </p>
           <p>
            Either way, I think we're being played, here. I'm going to give this post, and

This puts us in a hard place as we must feel safe to present related information and speculate, while also not making claims that may mislead people. Here I feel I am vetting finds with peers who are aware of the fragile nature of ALL the information we get from the screen, and that it is often weponized against us. Peers who are capable of holding to conflicting points in their heads at the same time, until more information contributes to that hypothesis.
            </p>
            <p>
             I am not trying to peddle misinfo (as you so kindly included), SO Is there a way to fix or reword my posts to more appropriately fit the guidelines of VOAT ? How should I proceed in the future? Frankly, we are talking of children and unspeakable crimes, so I think its worth risking a bad source, misconstrued phrase or wild speculation.
            </p>
            <p>
             I hope ALL of it is disinfo, we are wrong and the children are safe, but everything around me points otherwise. Hence why I'm fighting you a bit on this one.

              <p>
               Do we have a checklist or vetting process for our sources - or a way to rank certainty / corroboration ?

                No. We've got a best practices link in the sidebar; that's about it.

                "Antarctica" happens to be one of the disinfo topics that was very heavily pushed here during the first six months of our investigation, including by notorious sites like YourNewsWire and Millennium Report. They would cite supposed Wikileaks emails (with pics), but not link to them (always a dead giveaway). When you went to look them up on Wikileaks, there was no such email. The Podesta email that did have Antarctica in it was just some vacation pictures (one of which was cropped heavily and pushed several times as being of an alien spacecraft, LOL). Weird accounts with little to no Voat history spammed that stuff here, if I recall correctly.  You wouldn't know any of that history, of course. So to some extent, vetting is about experience. But it's also about using common sense and asking questions about things that sound like stuff the folks who don't want us investigating would like to see us fall for. You just look at the sources, ask questions, and click a few layers down.

             the ANTARCTICA trip is not likely an actual flight, many people have noted the various impossibilities ie fuel, aircraft size, GPS waypoint discrepancies etc. If my original title was misleading, because it included ANTARCTICA , I understand, but was referencing the story  and other theories linked, not my own.

             I am also aware this data , as with any from a crowdfunded source is HEARSAY, as anyone can submit.
            </p>
            <p>
             That said, I feel like it will deter investigation if labeled DISINFO, which is frankly what I think it needs. ANTARCTICA IS A GLITCH, TROLL or DISINFO. I am not in full support of what any of the data suggests, but I do think its worth digging on his flights, and vetting the info we have.

             They claim it is due to expense, but there are other similar sites which were censored outright.

              The simple solution is to report the discrepancy and the fact the data source is flawed along with the rest of the information. Then there is no need for a flair. The flair doesn't keep people from reading it, you know. It just lets then know to read more than the headline to find out what is going on.

            thanks to you some evidence was harder to scrub out! I am trying to remember / identify the source for the flights after Aug 4 2019 . I could have sworn they were part of the same list you archived here:
            <a href="https://archive.is/rj5Fb">
             https://archive.is/rj5Fb
            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            BUT , I am not seeing any dates after the 4th on the archive. Is it possible they be deleted even from the archive? Do you remember where those dates ? It is possible they were from a different one of his planes but the whole site is down so I cant really access much beyond what you saved.
           </p>
           <p>
            I have new appreciation for what you do, and the importance of Capturing our finds.

             Hi there OTI, I'm sorry I didn't get your ping before now, you misspelled it. :)

             In the future if you would like help archiving articles before you post them, please just DM them to me. I can work on them while you continue with your digging. I'll DM them back and you can use those links instead of the sources.

              ! Sorry for the misspell, but I originally pinged you as you helped archive the original "data" and we had questions about ADSB Exchange's validity, and where I found the dates after Aug 4th.

                Well we know the ADSB source gets its data from amateur aviators and results could feasibly be faked, that said if we don't take it all on face value, the whole thing is interesting. The feature on the site is now unavailable (though its been speculated that this could simply be a ploy for paid for access), your archive only shows till Aug 4th. I'm pretty sure it was ADSB, but I don't remember if the dates following were from one of the other planes.

                 Amateur aviators tell the truth like fishermen. I've always been amazed that people tend to place pilots on a higher plane of trustworthiness than average people. I think they lie more. After all, if you think about it, pilots are nothing but glorified bus drivers with an addiction to adrenaline. :D

             Thanks to both of you and others that have kept track of these flights. So valuable. I can see why those places but really. Newfoundland and Wy. Hmm Dick C. lives there.
