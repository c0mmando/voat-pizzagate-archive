<p>From my perspective Finders was a CIA run mind control sex slave experiment</p>
<p>1) I will first tell you how I knew about the experiment.</p>
<p>2) Then what the goal of the experiment was.</p>
<p>3) Then how the experiment was run.</p>
<p>4) Then what the lives of the children were like under it.</p>
<p>5) Then what went wrong with the experiment.</p>
<p>6) Then what the results of the experiment were.</p>
<p>7) Then what the CIA analysts said what the results were.</p>
<p>This really should be a full-length book on the enslavement of children.</p>
<p>I have 40 years inside the CIA and it was my intention to someday be able to expose all this abuse of children by the US govt. But I don’t have the time to write out all the details today. I just want to cover the overview of these topics.</p>
<p>My specific knowledge of the Finders experiment came from reading 3 books in the CIA and talking to two of the in-house researchers who were responsible for administering the Project in the Dept. of Plans, in the Division that should be called Mind Control but due the sensitive nature of the topic was instead called “Future Assets”.</p>
<p>Its main office was on the third floor of the main CIA building, until it moved to the 5th floor under Goss. By then I was gone. The importance of the move was that the higher up in the building the closer to the DCI, the higher the priority. That is the way the CIA works.</p>
<p>The main facility for that Division is not surprisingly in a separate building because the CIA has grown over time. It occupies 2 floors of a large building and has over 40 full time researchers in it. These are only devoted to mind control.</p>
<p>The CIA has a separate Division for Assets and their recruiting. The largest “Future Assets” facility is in Maryland, across the Potomac by about 40 miles; a fact one of its researchers we will call Ted Hallsted bemoaned to me as it caused him to be on the road a lot.</p>
<p>That facility has over 200 researchers in it and has a clinic and psychiatric hospital for children associated with it. Nominally it is a University Research center devoted to the study of childhood mental illness. However, the clients come for minor problems like learning disabilities, and attention deficit and leave as multiples without their parents knowing. The clinic only takes “high functioning” children—not schizophrenics, or cerebral palsy kids. Unsurprisingly, the Rockefellers, and the Carnegies are major funders of it.</p>
<p>To work there requires a special security clearance that only the CIA can give. I went over to look at the place once to size it up. That was in the 1980’s. Everyone was wearing the same badges that the CIA uses with the same magnetic strips on the back of a picture ID.</p>
<p>To get into the main research building one inserts the badge into the same type of entry stile as we were using at the CIA at that time. I inserted my badge from the CIA and got in no questions asked. Now I was on a bit of a mission at the time. I wanted to leave a particular book on the desk of a particular researcher—by hand and then leave before it was known who had done that. That action of my related to an unsolved murder of a child.</p>
<p>The researcher was supposed to follow up on all of his experimental subjects. I wanted him to know what had happened to that particular child as the result of the experiment that he had designed and run. The book was an internal CIA production FOR EYES ONLY and he was not on the list of EYES to see it. I felt that that was a deliberate oversight that needed to be corrected, so I did so.</p>
<p>The book had come to my attention at a meeting between the DCI and a CIA risk assessment lawyer on a possible lawsuit for a wrongful death. The DCI wanted me there to ask me if what was in the book was true. I asked for a copy of it to read it, naturally enough.</p>
<p>I was not on the list of EYES either but I had a NEED TO KNOW and so did that researcher. I told the DCI that the contents of the book, produced by a CIA analyst and an FBI homicide officer, were indeed true. The DCI frowned at that. The murderer was one George Bush, Sr. who was Vice President of the United States at the time. The book had been commissioned by the CIA to find all the loose ends and suppress them. To do that it had to have the truth.</p>
<p>It is not possible to do a competent cover-up job if you don’t have accurate intelligence to start with. The DCI wanted me to write a report on what else the CIA needed to know that was not in that book. Most of what I supplied was a list of over 20 other similar victims of the same Vice President; each one of which needed as thorough an investigation. They did not get it.</p>
<p>Part of how I later ended up as a “pathologist” part-time at the White House when Bush, Sr. was President, was due to this particular case almost coming to trial.</p>
<p>The boy was 6 when Bush ritually killed him in a Skull and Bones ceremony to curry the favor of the dark lord. The murder was committed within 5 miles of that “University Research” facility. Most of the 20 odd victims were killed at the same spot. It was a quick and easy drive from the White House.</p>
<p>This is hard on my regular personality to write down. She didn’t ever hear about this before. So bear with us as we try to go through this material in as straight a line as possible on a thorough fare without taking any turn offs, until you get to the exit and go about 2 miles east through a locked gate onto a military base that is quite small.</p>
<p>That base was put there just for Bush, Sr. as Vice President. The only function of it and it is still there is to skim off some of those research kids for rituals. The base is tiny by most standards. It houses only the guards that work the security of it—about 3. There are no Army offices, no PX, no parade grounds, etc.</p>
<p>It is still there today as I type this. It may be razed tomorrow, like the McMartin tunnels as a result of what I am saying. But today, as a remote viewer, I can see that it has one main square building on the center of a square lot with the entrance on its West side and a guard standing at it though the gate is locked. Only one person has the key. That is Bush, Sr. It is his private reserve still. The guards are his prisoners inside of it. They are Army recruits in theory and on paper.</p>
<p>No guard assigned to work there has ever made it out alive. That is to make sure that they don’t talk about what they have seen. What have they seen? Bush, Sr. come in and out. A boy child driven up in a van and unloaded when Bush, Sr. comes. A “pathologist” and the guards Bush brings with him carries out a coffin as Bush, Sr. leaves. Access to the road to the gate is restricted. So no neighbors or passing traffic sees this strange recurrence of events. While Bush, Sr. was President he didn’t have time to go out there and the White House morgue and incinerator were used.</p>

             Do what you want with it, The fact that you perceive it to be "remote viewing" when she is a whistleblower from CIA at highest level and the information is not dependent on remote viewing is lost on you.
            </p>
            <p>
             It is amusing that you consider the group you moderate to be "verifiable" claims only when actually you want tobe sppodfed information as you will not research further. You are strangling this sub, as you always have - just look at it  - a shadow of its former self.

              If the FBI verified it, please show me where. She talks about the existence of a base -- that should be easily verifiable, but instead of providing additional sources, you made more unsourced claims and then tried to smear me. Pretty lame and fairly reliable disinfo indicator. Also, I did not remove the flair. Apparently, it did not make it through the cache update before Voat went offline, which has been happening intermittently for days.

             <p>
              I'll reflair it for another 24 Hours and see if you have any actual verification to post as you claim.

               "My specific knowledge of the Finders experiment came from reading 3 books in the CIA and talking to two of the in-house researchers who were responsible for administering the Project in the Dept. of Plans, in the Division that should be called Mind Control but due the sensitive nature of the topic was instead called “Future Assets”.

               Its main office was on the third floor of the main CIA building, until it moved to the 5th floor under Goss. By then I was gone. The importance of the move was that the higher up in the building the closer to the DCI, the higher the priority. That is the way the CIA works."

                   Just as the fact that a person is a dancer is not her sole means of locomotion, then just because the person is a remote viewer is not her sole means of acquiring information. She can read documents directly with her eyes

                   She did not she clearly says she got this information  ""My specific knowledge of the Finders experiment came from reading 3 books in the CIA and talking to two of the in-house researchers who were responsible for administering the Project in the Dept. of Plans, in the Division that should be called Mind Control but due the sensitive nature of the topic was instead called “Future Assets”."

                   Your fixation is that you do not believe in remote viewing as you have no knowledge of this. There is nothing i can say to a person who refuses to research remote viewing and refuses to belive that people can read as well as remote view.

            I have read some of this before but not in such detail. Or I blocked it out of my mind. None of this surprises me about Bush Sr. Did he rape these poor boys before killing them?  That’s what he was seen to do in a closet once in a brownstone party given by Barney Frank. Bush St. was a Bile Monster.
