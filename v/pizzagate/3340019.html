<blockquote>
<p>A court filing from the government and a filing by Epstein’s defense team both stated he owns six properties, along with other personal property. He appears to own the holdings through several shell companies named after trees – Maple Inc., Laurel Inc. and Cypress Inc. – according to online records.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>One wrinkle: Epstein\'s name is not on the deed to the Zorro Ranch. Instead, it\'s a company based out of the US Virgin Islands, a famously opaque tax shelter where Epstein owns a private island. The ranch has been widely identified in the press as belonging to Epstein, however. </p>
<p>If Epstein is the sole shareholder, according to Gorence, then it\'s easy enough to seize the property. But if there are other shareholders involved, things get dicey. The owner company, listed as Cypress, Inc. in county records, is not publicly traded and does not have a public-facing website. Data from Bloomberg Research reports a property holding company called Cypress Dynasty Limited based out of the Virgin Islands, a subsidiary of another subsidiary of an investment firm in Hong Kong, but SFR was unable to immediately determine if it\'s the same company that holds the Zorro Ranch, or who the shareholders are.</p>

<p>William Blum is a tax and business lawyer with substantial expertise in international taxation. His practice emphasizes domestic and offshore tax matters and structures, including tax controversies, as well as estate and asset protection planning. He has served as counsel to the Governor of the United States Virgin Islands, and is the leading expert on the territory’s status as a tax haven for non-U.S. persons. Mr. Blum is admitted to practice in New York, Colorado, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, the U.S. Virgin Islands, Guam, and the Republic of the Marshall Islands.</p>
<p>Mr. Blum speaks regularly on tax issues at conferences around the world, including those sponsored by the Center for International Legal Studies. He has written articles for CCH, BNA and Euromoney on tax issues in the U.S. as well as the U.S. Virgin Islands, and he drafted that territory’s foreign sales corporation and exempt company laws. From 2004 to 2007, Mr. Blum served as the president of Interlegal, an international network of law firms with members in over 40 countries.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Now, I\'m beginning to understand why those MSM journalists didn\'t want to dig any further on those \'shell companies\'.  
</p>
<p>Blum is the author of a number of articles on the topic of taxation, including this one: <em>Aircraft Structure: &quot;The American Paradise -- U.S. Virgin Islands: FAA Registration of Foreign-Owned Aircraft,&quot; by William L. Blum and Marjorie Rawls Roberts, The Air and Space Lawyer, Fall 1994, American Bar Association.</em></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Patrick G. Barclay, LL.M. is CEO and founder of the Bambu Fund LLC. As an experienced chief executive officer, Mr. Barclay has a demonstrated history covering more than 30 years of being a skilled negotiator, business planner, operations manager, facilities manager and an exceptionally strong business development professional. Mr. Barclay was the first chief operating officer at Ariel Investments while the firm’s assets under management grew from US$500 million to US$1.8 billion. During the formation of the Bambu Fund, under his leadership, Bambu has established projects like the International Medical Services Credentialing Portal ® and Bambu Health &amp; Wellness ®.</p>
<p>During March of 2015, Mr. Barclay was a member of an official trade delegation, sponsored by a member of the U.S. House of Representatives, that met with Jamaica’s leadership to discuss their desire to support the growth and development of projects under Jamaica’s “Medical Tourism” regime. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Uh huh...</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Since that time, Mr. Barclay and the team that he has been carefully assembling have been establishing projects that will improve lives, create jobs and impact economic development in the Latin American Caribbean region (LAC). Ever visionary, <strong>Mr. Barclay has created a platform that permits targeted investment in communities ravaged by the hurricanes of 2016 and 2017.</strong> Mr. Barclay intends to prove the often-overlooked LAC region is investor safe and filled with undiscovered gems that provide remarkable social and financial returns.</p>
<p>As the <strong>President of Nephtali, Inc.</strong> for more than 20 years, Mr. Barclay managed a variety of corporate real estate service activities for clients that included The Home Depot and BP. This involved: acquisition and disposition services; commercial land valuations; managing the environmental remediation of former petroleum marketing locations and the management of 18 cafes inside the former EXPO Design Centers in the Midwest and Southern regions of the United States. Additional responsibilities while with Ariel Investments, included secretary to the board of directors and a director of the Ariel Foundation. Prior to his time at Ariel, Mr. Barclay was special assistant to former Governor James R. Thompson in the State of Illinois, while on loan from AT&amp;T.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In March 2015,  Barclay participated in an official trade delegation sponsored
by <strong>U.S. Rep. Danny K. Davis of the 7th Congressional District of
Illinois</strong> to meet with Jamaica’s leadership.  <a href="http://bambufund.com/bambu-fund-llc-corporate-overview.pdf">http://bambufund.com/bambu-fund-llc-corporate-overview.pdf</a></p>

<p>...Although Davis was fully promoted as a Democratic candidate, he also ran as a New Party candidate.[19][20][21] Supporting this was New Party’s celebration of him as the &quot;first New Party member elected to the U.S. Congress.&quot;[22] Although the State of Illinois did not permit fusion voting, New Party advocated fusion voting as a means to promote their party and party agenda and to particularly project New Party ideology into the mainstream Democratic Party.[23] Candidates were referred to as &quot;N[ew]P[arty] Democrats&quot;[23] and were required to sign a contract mandating a &quot;visible and active relationship&quot; with New Party.[24] During this timeframe, New Party was experiencing substantial growth.[25] Davis also received the endorsement of the Chicago Democratic Socialists of America (CDSA)[26] of which he is a member[27][28] and had a relationship pre-dating his congressional run. <strong>ACORN, AFL-CIO, Sierra Club, and International Brotherhood of Teamsters are included in other groups also endorsing Davis in his bid.</strong></p>

<p>In 2004, Davis was met with national controversy when he crowned the late <strong>Rev. Sun Myung Moon</strong> in a religious ceremony at the Dirksen Senate Office Building honoring the controversial spiritual leader...</p>
