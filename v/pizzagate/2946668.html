<blockquote>
<p>Anders Sandberg is a Swedish computer scientist and transhumanist. Born in 1972, he obtained an MSc in computer science in 1997 and a PhD in computer science in 2003. Wikipedia and his page at the FHI say he has a PhD in computational neuroscience, though. He was part of the Royal Institute of Technology in Stockholm and now is a Research Fellow at the Future of Humanity Institute in Oxford.  </p>
<p>Between 1996 and 2000 he chaired the Swedish Transhumanist Association. </p>
<p>In 2000 he founded the Eudoxa think-thank, which has discussed biotechnology, harm reduction, health care, nanotechnology, RFID, and intellectual property, and is a co-founder of the Orion\'s Arm Universe Project, which has made extensive use of his images and glossary of transhumanist terminology. </p>

<p><strong>His transumanist personal page</strong>: aleph.se/Trans/ - transhumanist personal page</p>
<blockquote>
<p>His research outside of neuroscience centers around the ethical and philosophical issues around emerging technologies such as nanotechnology and Whole Brain Emulation. Besides many papers on neuroscience, his science writing also includes WBE Roadmap \'Whole Brain Emulation: A Roadmap Technical Report\', written with Nick Bostrom in 2008. </p>

<p>Another one: “THE NECRONOMICON” goes to gopher://wiretap.spies.com/00/Library/Fringe/Occult/necron.txt</p>
<p>I tried one of the broken links in the wayback machine and got this: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20010306025736/http://zeta.cs.adfa.oz.au:80/Spirit/resources-astrology.html">https://web.archive.org/web/20010306025736/http://zeta.cs.adfa.oz.au:80/Spirit/resources-astrology.html</a></p>

<p>ADFA is a unique partnership between the Australian Defence Force (ADF) and the University of New South Wales(UNSW) which provides training and education for the future leaders of the Navy, Army and Air Force. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>I don\'t know if that link was taken up by another company but definitely we need people to go through his index of estorecia links.  One of his other main pages is here: <a href="http://www.aleph.se/">http://www.aleph.se/</a></p>
<p>I think this once again highlights the initimate relationship between transhumanism and something very dark.

            <p>
             Charles River was founded in 1947 by Henry Foster, a young veterinarian who purchased thousands of rat cages from a Virginia farm and set up a one-man laboratory in Boston overlooking the Charles River. In an effort to fulfill the regional need for laboratory animal models, he bred, fed and cared for the animals and personally delivered them to local researchers. In the last six decades, this one-man laboratory has evolved into a worldwide network.
            </p>
            <p>
             In August 2017, the business announced it would acquire Brains On-Line
            </p>
            <p>
             The company has been the target of animal rights activists in the UK and US. It owned Shamrock Farm in England's West Sussex which closed in 2000 following a 15-month campaign by animal rights activists. The chairman and chief executive officer is James C. Foster, the son of founder Henry Foster. PETA named Foster #1 on its "Dirty Dozen" list of the twelve worst CEOs in the world for cruelty to animals in laboratories.

Patrick Solvay, main shareholder of the Solvay Group, actually lives in the castle.  Little wonder that Solvay Pharmaceuticals introduced the drug Luvox to the world.  The same Luvox that was the first SSRI exclusively marketed to children with OCD by the FDA in 1997.  The same Luvox that Eric Harris was on in 1999 when he and his buddy Dylan Klebold became the Columbine patsies.  Solvay is also the number one mass producer/distributor of fluoride and vaccines in the world.  Etienne Davignon, former three-time member of the Trilateral Commission, and current Chairman of the Bilderberg group, is on their board of directors, and is whispered to be a Solvay by birth, changing his last name to hide who he was.  Going farther back in the timeline, Ernest Solvay was close confidante with Hitler.

            <p>
             Tate is delighted to announce that the new building at Tate Modern is to be named the Blavatnik Building in recognition of the lead donation from the Blavatnik Family Foundation headed by the global industrialist and philanthropist Len Blavatnik.
            </p>
            <p>
             The gift, which was pledged in 2011, well before the opening of the new Tate Modern, is one of the largest ever made in Tate’s history.
            </p>
            <p>
             Len Blavatnik (59) is a major international industrialist and philanthropist. He was born in the Soviet Union and emigrated to the US with his family in 1978, becoming a US citizen in 1984. In addition, he became a UK citizen in 2010.
            </p>
            <p>
             He has advanced degrees from Columbia and Harvard Universities, and sits on academic boards at Harvard and Tel Aviv University. He has long taken a close and active interest in higher education and in 2010 funded the establishment of the Blavatnik School of Government at the University of Oxford. He has funded programmes at Cambridge for the Judge Business School and the Blavatnik Israel Fellows. He sits on the Board of Governors of the New York Academy of Sciences, and sponsors the annual Blavatnik Awards for Young Scientists in the US, the UK and Israel to honour outstanding young scientists and engineers.

            <blockquote>
             <p>
              Transhumanism (abbreviated as H+ or h+) is an international philosophical movement that advocates for the transformation of the human condition by developing and making widely available sophisticated technologies to greatly enhance human intellect and physiology.
             </p>
             <p>
              According to
              <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nick_Bostrom">
               Nick Bostrom
              </a>
              , transcendentalist impulses have been expressed at least as far back as the quest for immortality in the Epic of Gilgamesh, as well as in historical quests for the Fountain of Youth, the Elixir of Life, and other efforts to stave off aging and death.
             </p>
             <p>
              Fundamental ideas of transhumanism were first advanced in 1923 by the British geneticist J. B. S. Haldane in his essay Daedalus: Science and the Future, which predicted that great benefits would come from the application of advanced sciences to human biology—and that every such advance would first appear to someone as blasphemy or perversion, "indecent and unnatural". In particular, he was interested in the development of the science of eugenics, ectogenesis (creating and sustaining life in an artificial environment), and the application of genetics to improve human characteristics, such as health and intelligence.
             </p>
             <p>
              His article inspired academic and popular interest. J. D. Bernal, a crystallographer at Cambridge, wrote
              <em>
               The World, the Flesh and the Devil
              </em>
              in 1929, in which he speculated on the prospects of space colonization and radical changes to human bodies and intelligence through bionic implants and cognitive enhancement.[13] These ideas have been common transhumanist themes ever since.[2]

              The biologist

               Julian Huxley
              </strong>
              is generally regarded as the founder of transhumanism after using the term for the title of an influential 1957 article.

             The general public view Transhumanism as completely rooted in materialists science but we can find indications of an occult agenda. Here for example, an article : The Magus of Silicon Valley: Ray Kurzweil’s Transhumanism as Contemporary Esotericism -

            <blockquote>
             <p>
              In this paper, I will argue thatKurzweil’s transhumanism contains a dimension of 
transgressiveand millenarian spirituality 
that is best understood as an emergingform of contemporary esotericism.
             </p>
             <p>
              The
second
part of my argument is that transhumanism, as amovement, is currently
merging with
and
mobilizing
parts of theocculture. Transhumanist milieus appear to be converging with thetechnophilian, science-oriented wing of what used to be the “NewAge movement”, and with fashionable “Eastern” religious systems. Thus, transhumanism adds a new set of discursive elements to what Kennet Granholm calls the “discursive complexes” that make upcontemporary esotericism.

              This is how I see the coming sixth root race: a people of pluralism, individuality, new ways of image-based reading and thinking, leading up to an amalgamation of all those relatively enlightened individual humans into what is really a transhuman stage, the neuro technological linkage of all minds into agrand array of consciousness. That united supermind will be the seventh rootrace, the last which will have need at all for this physical world and which we hope will live on a spiritual level appropriate to its tremendous leap into cosmic consciousness.

              The scope of Epstein’s various science projects spans research into genetics, neuroscience, robotics, computer science, and artificial intelligence (AI). Altogether, the convergence of these science subfields comprises an interdisciplinary science known as “transhumanism”: the artificial “perfection” of human evolution through humankind’s merger with technology. In fact, Epstein partners with Humanity+, a major transhumanism interest group.

            <p>
             The rest of that article is well worth a read as it connects a lot of bug names in the world of technology and explains their interest in eugenics.

            Transhumanism is the enemy of God. Also, consider the push for transgender persons. Why?? It resembles Baphomet and it is defying God. It is all tied in with Satanism or rather a Luciferian agenda. These madmen want to play God. Horror of horrors awaits them

Nonetheless, the Catholic Church, as directed by its hierarchy in the Vatican, is a principle force in opposing population growth control.

             That said, like many places, Glenstal Abbey benefited financially during the boom. “We’ve had some extremely generous donors, which allowed us to build a new library, the guest house and the new reception area.” There are plans to build three or four eco-friendly “God pods” near the abbey’s 17th-century walled garden. “That’s what is needed now: spaces where people can have as much silence and solitude as they want and yet be connected to the church.” Another plan in gestation is a farm where children can come to interact with animals and nature and then express themselves through workshops led by artists. “This will give children, especially those from feud-scarred areas of Limerick, a chance to express themselves artistically, which is the most enriching thing.”

             The "Qlippothic" "magick" at the link is part of an entirely fictional role-playing game called
             <em>
              Mage: the Ascension
             </em>
             .  That particular page is not evidence of anything more sinister than
             <em>
              Dungeons &amp; Dragons
             </em>
             .
            </p>
            <p>
             The directory at:

             is a directory of legal accusations of alleged sex crimes. It may have been assembled by people with bad intentions, but the allegations have the same standing as any other allegation of crime.

              I think you missed the point of my post.  I already explained that Sanders is well known in the gamer community and the link to the podcast is an interview where he talks about the games such as
              <em>
               Mage: the Ascension
              </em>
              and he also talks about his own personal interest in magic, especially the hermetic variety.  The rest  of the post talks about the  influence and connections of theosophy and transhumanism within the international relations community.
             </p>
             <p>
              The take-home lesson is:

           <pre><code>    &gt;&gt;many ufo-related documents (some of dubious reputability) in 
    pub/ufo.  See README's in the directory (and subdirectories). 
    Files are a little disorganized right now, since the document- 
    collection process is still going on, but if you're looking 
    for that "special file", this is a good place to check out. 
    More recent versions of the FAQ can be found here as 
    a.a.v-faq.  All files except the README's are in unix- 
    compressed format, so please be sure to use 'binary' transfer  
    mode. Anonymous ftp enabled.
