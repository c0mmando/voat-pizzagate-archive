            When this pizzagate horror was exposed the one that they "say" was a Pedo that broke my heart the most was Justice Scalia. I still hold out hope that his involvement is a yuuuuge lie.
           </p>
           <p>
            I liked Robin Williams, I hope you all are correct that he was not a Pedo.

            I have stopped watching all movies, TV, no magazines, no newspapers,  and no MSM!
I do not listen to radio/music ect either. I am trying to filter what info I am exposed to now.

            Fucking hell. Really makes you wonder if he did commit suicide or "suicided himself".

            Maybe we need to get a message to the celebs that if they all come out together the world will not care. We care more about these poor children and the suppression of humanity by these sickos.

            Lovely post. It helps to hear in detail how others feel about everything we know. It's overwhelming .. but we are still here for those children. We are strong. Together stronger.

             No. The title is misleading. They will have filmed him in some sort of compromising position I think they said. If you read what RW says
             <em>
              "in italics"
             </em>
             he was investigating it himself so couldn't be one.

            This is related to pizzagate because Robin Williams who just recently died and now through a written letter has verified what we are researching.  He  stated he dis "hours of research".  This is not just a whim, he did the hard research.  It is important to our case for it will verify it also with normies.  A letter from a well known person that believes in our Investigation of organ harvesting, human trafficking.

                No, and we have spent all our time researching.  We have no time to make up anything.  Who could ever think up all this stuff.  Have you ever heard of a criminal that was such a genius, like Bundy, and then it made you wonder, What good could this person have achieved if he had only gone in the right direction?  I just wonder how our world and our country would be, if they had all done what they were suppose to do.  We would all be in a much better place.  I have had such dark feelings at times, thinking about living through this nightmare.  But I am so very glad that I know what I know, rather than being in pitch dark. Being Red Pilled at a time like this is a wonderful feeling.

            Thank you for this. It will help me deal with the endless assault of Deep State shills that are sent here on a daily to keep Andrew McCabe at the FBI in power so he complete his job of framing Trump using Guccifer 2.0 and getting him impeached all so psychopaths in the Deep State can keep raping children and stealing organs from the ugly ones.
