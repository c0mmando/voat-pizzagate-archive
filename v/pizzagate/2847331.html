It was my attempts to remain anonymous &amp; not get removed from yet another platform (<a href="http://mixlr.com/peleg">http://mixlr.com/peleg</a>) that caused me to post a too-cryptic hint at what I was trying to share.  I cannot, in good conscience, let my own fears keep this quiet any longer. I have started &amp; deleted several times...trying to decide what can be shared here.
I have found, in publicly available audio, underlying communication that they don\'t know is being picked up. (or they wouldn\'t be talking this way).
Here are some quotes. From &quot;alice&quot;, at Oxford interview Oct 9 2018 (air date). She said dems couldn\'t be civil..if that helps. The interviewer delivered a message at that start. &quot;Poor Ms. Weeza (Louisa), establishment closed. Ms. Elgoonie..Ms &quot;eldy&quot;...stashed loosh for you. Ms. eldy\'s guests are human. That\'s who you need&quot;. Alice vividly describes: ____ served an 8 yr old for the Feast of &quot;Whelps&quot; (what I\'m hearing) and it was awful&quot; Mark\'s _____ passed her out, and I ate. It was dry and needed sous&quot; (had to look up sous...cooking method for tough meat)..and loosh sent by a sultan, but had arsenic on it (i think as a preservative)...Alice says &quot;I alone would not suck it. Nasty loosh&quot;. (I didn\'t know they &quot;suck it&quot;). And some one named mary jo fernandez, who served jon bennet (I know it sounds insane)...&quot;sooo rich, there was actually one left&quot; then alice cackles like a goul. They remember this child so often, I don\'t know what to think about it. Alice has some preserved with salt to suck on that &quot;got me through Christmas&quot;. I couldn\'t make this stuff up. I knew where to go back and look for talk about loosh of the past...I watched video to see when alice paused and swallowed. &quot;so there I was, with 8 yr old loosh, that\'s number one.&quot; She - &amp; others - talk about knicklebockers. Alot. &quot;every night the knicklebockers eat&quot;. Or there\'s DF. &quot;need a little loosh everynight&quot;...or threatening another sen. &quot;I warn you...the wolf...earring left at my house..dna...I searched &amp; found .....ferral are we....where your wife is at night...that girl of yours...fleece around her neck&quot;...That\'s playing tonight here <a href="http://mixlr.com/peleg">http://mixlr.com/peleg</a>.
I\'m not trying to get followers, numbers..I\'m trying to keep my head low &amp; get the info out, especially since I can hear the words right away, which is about 10 - 30 % of ppl...(hough everyone can &quot;tune&quot; their ears to it...just takes more time) I\'ve listened to hundreds of hours..repeating &amp; hearing more...it actually made me ill. I had to adjust the frequency to keep doing it.
There are so many ppl in this..or at least with this communication ability..and it involved dna implant. &quot;initiation&quot; as they call it. Done by those &quot;viscious knicklebockers&quot;, whoever they are.
I can\'t find any info about the particular occult practice they are doing, but they have seen..with their own eyes..a giant owl. Not all would bow to it, and it seems their memory of it is gone. 2 &quot;good guys&quot; that I\'ve heard remember now, only recently, and because of what I\'ve heard, I believe QAnon involved in recovering those memories. Anymore on that would expose innocent ppl.
These ppl so &quot;sacraments&quot;..serving loosh..and many used to serve. Alice says &quot;remember that girl Brittany? Now that she\'s all fat &amp; famous..went to her birthday..asked &quot;where you putting it&quot;..she showed me a dessert table, ..but that\'s not loosh though! Loosh, loosh (actually sounds like she\'s sobbing when she says this part)...and &quot; i keep thinking maybe Nick will serve this or serve for that, and I\'ll go get me some loosh. Nick used to serve a lot.&quot; Everyone is &quot;so nervous&quot; - this may be what they say the most - that no one is serving anymore...as alice says &quot;that damn QAnon&quot;. Alice says &quot;who knew the illegals and the Arabs would fail&quot; at the same time she\'s saying &quot;who knew about wikileaks, and Comey&quot;.
I came here b/c this is where I found out what loosh was...DF is asking &quot;praying&quot; actually..&quot;please send more of your wolf dna&quot;...for more initiates. She\'s saying the need to have &quot;the next knicklebocker thing&quot;. The caravan is getting closer...I know what that\'s about, &amp; now so do you. Any price will be paid to keep them coming for the few that can be picked off, or are being &quot;delivered&quot;.
I explain alot more as I go through the clips ...there\'s too much. For the 2 &quot;podcasts&quot; out, I have so much more, &amp; hours more I\'m listening to.
They don\'t consider themselves human...and we are cattle to them. Even a mid-eastern Gov official remarked on the &quot;how&quot; these ppl do..viscious, shocking,...that there, they make it easy as they kill them for loosh.
I\'m going to put up DF now. I need people aware..not their numbers...it\'s more dangerous being the only one.  BTW..God showed me where to look..an answer to a prayer..to reveal to us what they say &amp; do in secret, as Elisha did for Israel. How literally He answered that prayer.</p>',

                I just listened to the very beginning of that, and the recording the woman is playing isn't intelligible and sounds chopped up and out of context. I think what would be needed here is a clear transcript of what is being claimed, this audio, and then links to the original sources the woman is using in her recording. It would need a clear statement of how it's relevant to the abuse of kids by the global elite, also.

               OMG..THANK YOU.I apologize I haven't seen this sooner - bogged down in tech issues trying to share audio on various platforms. Getting shut down &amp; resetting somewhere new takes a chunk of time. Anonymity is out the window too. It was a matter of time. So now it's time setting up a website so I don't get shutdown. You have no idea how much I value this..I've been searching for soooo long, - but results are suppressed. And honestly, judging from just my own "experiments"..few people hear what I hear right away. God gave me weirdly phenomenal hearing, it's a family joke...no secrets.  I'm hearing things that give me a sense of urgency in sharing...plans...attempts...I don't feel I have the time to learn the WHAT ..as in what they believe, their terminology etc...when I can hear what they're doing &amp; planning right NOW. I need a crash course..any other links would be appreciated. If by some miracle you have a small platform &amp; trying to build followers...and giant balls...then I've got some stuff for you.

            Thanks for the info and bringing up Loosh.  Next time please use paragraphs to space your post.  It makes it easier to read.

            Yes, they do bad things for loosh.  Evil=Loosh   This is something that not many are aware of.  It is Their Secret and we must Wake Up.  Why do you think there has been so much more evil in this world than when you were a Child?  Hm?  The devil loves to spread evil loosh.  We can change this by doing good works and being kind to others.  He hates that.   Smile at people and do something nice to help others at least once a day.  Small acts will suffice.  Be nice and pee in his cheerios.

             I am just now catching catching wind of this NOMOCHOMO and I am sorry you got caught up in this. Ignore crensch and tell your story. crensch is a little overbearing and tends to alienate people. I have pretty much been off the internet for a couple of weeks ago and this is a travesty. If you have something to say IGNORE CRENSCH and don't take it pesonally because crensch is about as smart as a bucket of salt beans.

             Just make sure you read the rules in the sidebar and try to follow them. If you that you should be ok.

             can have you making good posts in no time but you HAVE TO pay attention to the rules in the sidebar. It is necessary for a lot of good reasons.

               <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/v/pizzQanon">
                v/pizzQanon
               </a>
               which is what onw mod around here would have wanted to turn it into. With pure tenacity, and care, and hundreds of hours of paying attention, I AM THE REASON this sub is still simply
               <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/v/pizzagate">
                v/pizzagate
               </a>
               instead of some weird Frankenstein hybrid of pizzagate and Qanon. Nobody truly knows what all I did and how much sleep I lost to make that happen. I don't need medals and applause, but I can promise you that I did save this sub from doom
              </p>
              <p>
               This sub was doomed to be mixed with the world of Qanon speculation and guesses and I made it my mission for that not to happen to
               <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/v/pizzagate">
                v/pizzagate
               </a>
               . I wanted
               <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/v/pizzagate">
                v/pizzagate
               </a>
               to remain pure and stay on it's mission.
              </p>
              <p>
               Guessing Qanon riddles IS NOT THE MISSSION OF THIS SUB.
              </p>
              <p>
               This mission of this sub is to save children. I kept Qanon out of this place according to
               <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/u/vindicator">
                @vindicator
               </a>
               and I am damn proud of that. Fuck, as many hours as that took me to do, I could have built another house. I don't feel bad about what I did. I did a good thing. I don't expect any gratitude, and I hope people learned a valuable lesson which is this&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;DON'T MIX BULLSHIT WITH PIZZAGATE, LET PIZZAGATE BE PIZZAGATE and slowly morph into INSTITUTIONAL CHILD ABUSE........siggghhh..........I won't always be here to do this.

People can make submissions about Q any time they want, just like they have always been able to. The only thing you did was convince

                to create a fantastic QAnon subverse. That completely backfired though, because she's got so many thousands of subscribers, and they are all free to post about Q without having to comply with this subverse's stringent ruleset or horrific subject matter! Your bullshit also bonded the mod team with old goats in a way that never happened prior to your astroturfing with fake accounts. Prior to your lying, gaslighting and vote brigading, we did not work together very smoothly. But you forged us into a battle-hardened team MUCH more savvy at shill-spotting and working together.

                 sub. More interesting than
                 <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/v/pizzagate">
                  v/pizzagate

                <p>
                 You ain't near as smart as you think. Wipe the smug off because I could not be happier. Q and pizzagate are a different deal. That was my goal. I accomplished that. I am happy.

                <p>
                 NOW, I hardly even log into Voat, at all, because I have bigger shit to do than keep you from fucking up that last place on the internet that saves children.

                  You have me inspiration to make a 3 Part Post. You can start on
                  <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/v/GreatAwakening/2864950">
                   PART 1
                  </a>
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  I don’t know if I ever told you this, but you are the reason why I started that sub. I was not the type that would have ever taken on some type of leadership role. I was still really sensitive by shills hateful comments. During that time, not just paid shills, but Goats attacked Q followers ruthlessly. I can understand why they would think Q was a LARP at the time. But more than anyone on pizzagate, you went after the ones that posted about Q, in every thread.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  You were much more patient before Q. We became friends. You taught me a lot about Jews and secret societies. You would share links, PDFs, videos, etc... When Q came along, you became harsh, and even mean to anyone that would post something that included Q. Even if the post was helpful and lead to something we hadn’t know yet. It honestly made people not want to post because they knew you would attack them.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  I, honest to God, started thinking about making my own sub because of you. You made me nervous. I remember telling
                  <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/u/Bopper">
                   @Bopper
                  </a>
                  at the time that I was thinking about it. Then you went off on someone really bad one day and I thought fuck this, you didn’t want pizzagate turning into a Q sub, I’m going for it and starting my own, so that us from pizzagate could have a place to post about Q, and and not worry about your attacks. Since you were my friend and complained about it being discussed in pizzagate, we agreed that you would stay away from that sub, and I would leave you along about your bashing Trump.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  I figured at most, a couple of hundred would join. It would be laid back and no big deal. But, Q continued proving that he (they) were working right alongside our president. No matter how many attempts to discredit Q, even by you, the Q movement grew. You would say nothing was happening. You told me that a post I made about a child trafficking ring being busted, where there were a lot of arrests, was fake news. I kept telling you that things ARE happening. You would continuously tell us that Trump was a Freemason and a Globalist. But Trump and Q kept proving themselves.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  You, among others, complained that there were no arrests. Where are the arrests?! That’s why I made these posts. The 3rd one is Pizzagate and Q.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  We agreed as friends we wouldn’t attack the other for the others beliefs. You’ve been pretty respectful on Great Awakening. But, this was a little fucked up. A cool sub where people can speculate and guess all day?
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  I try to stay out of the drama when it comes to you. But I am seeing this and just tripping out. Why are you taking credit for any of this? Pizzagate is not ruined, Q didn’t ruin pizzagate. Read my posts and then you tell me how Q has been bad for pizzagate. GA turned out EXACTLY as you wanted it? You didn’t have any hand in how it turned out. No matter what you, or anyone says, Q took pizzagate main stream. Q is no longer a conspiracy.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  Read my posts and prove to me that Q is a conspiracy and that this movement has not woke people up like never before? If anything, you helped make the Q movement grow because you’re why I made that sub.

                   is under the rule of a 19 year old punk like you. It is what it is, I will cast pearls upon swine because my knowledge IS UTILIZED upon better platforms than what you have turned this little shit storm of a platform into. Congratulations.....you fucked up the last repository of child saving forums on the internet. That is your legacy. All the old timers with the real knowledge left this place. That is your legacy asshole.

                     What you fail to' understand is that I don't even login to this site very often anymore. You can continue to chase my ghosts, that don't exist, if it gives you something to do. Stop accusing innocent members of being me. That is wrong and you have alienated a lot of innocent users on this site. Don't be cancer, which is what you are. Stop being cancer. My mission was to split Qanon into it's own sub so that pizzagate could survive. It was something that had to be done that you were not smart enough to do. Now

                     has one of the most popular subs on Voat, pizzagate is still alive, and everybody should be happy about that. You were too stupid to do it, so I did it for you. You almost got credit for destroying pizzagate, You and

                     , but I decided to step in and save pizzagate. I did it. Its done. Everybody got benefits from my tireless efforts. I won't do this again. I will never step in here again and save this place. Maintain what I did and learn from it.

                      If you have two shits about this, Esoteric, you wouldn't have created a dozen sock puppets and worked them so hard vote brigading, attacking innocent users so you could defend them, and undermining everyone's trust in the motives of these accounts.

                    Remember, I exist because ESOTERICshade protects child-fuckers and grooms new, naive users on this site to help push his narrative that mods are pedos, and to attack the narratives his handlers don't want discussed.  Also, he REALLY likes meth, it seems.

                  You take your position on the "mod team" too seriously. Its not a "team" its two or three independent thinkers doing the best they can to hold this thing together and make it work. It is not a TEAM its a couple of dedicated people trying to make sure people follow the rules in the sidebar. I would not do what you do. I fought HARD for you to get here. You and

                  are pretty much what is left of the scuffle that happened in getting rid of MilFalcon. I am damn happy with the way you guys mod this forum. I have no complaints.

                  After kicking Mil Falcon out of this place I had one thing left that I wanted to do, and that was to kick Qanon out of this place BECAUSE Qanon would have bleached out, washed out, discredited, and overcome pizzagate if it were allowed in this sub.

                  I don't understand why that is so hard to understand. I fought hard against it being allowed in this sub. This sub is supposed to be about facts, and its NOT SUPPOSED TO BE ABOUT SOME ANONYMOUS SOURCE of wut? on the internet.

                     I have accomplished a lot of things in my life. Splitting off Qanon into it's own subverse is one of my greatest achievements and it took a lot of time out of my time to make it happen.

                      It is usually easier to fool people than to convince them that they have been fabulously fooled in a big way. Seems most people have just enough of a little touch of malignant type narcissism that makes them detest realizing that they have been fooled.

                    <p>
                     Apologies in advance: He might not have said 'frickin' shit', maybe it was 'damn shit' or something. But you'll get the idea.

              Great job. You just crushed another person that is not me. Has it ever dawned upon you that this is

              I have not logged into Voat in two weeks. When I did I had the notification on this. I laughed out loud. I can't believe you are so pathetic that I am still living in your head with my muddy boots on the coffee table of your mind. You seriously need to get a fucking life. While I have been out living my life, not even logging into Voat, you are running all over Voat like a paranoid little rat finding ESOTERICshade around every corner. Truly pathetic. Try less meth.
