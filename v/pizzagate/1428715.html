            In summary to my last post..Public rituals involve scripted events and fictional characters/personas. For all sorts of purposes. It's possible Maddy isn't/wasn't a real person, but the ritual is in fact the mass global observation of the script as the 'story' unfolds. Remember the McCanns visting the Pope?
           </p>
           <p>
            Other recent scripted characters include Satoshi, the supposed 'developer' of Bitcoin. And tons of fake murder stories in the US/UK. There is actually a photography department at one of the universities in Tel Aviv, that creates life-like images for the fake characters.
           </p>
           <p>
            Look up Ono Academic College, in the Kiryat Ono suburb. It has links to AP and Reuters. I've been saying for ages that Mossad are mostly hidden, compartmentalised media fixers for press agencies in London, Paris and NYC. They are fairly clever, but once you figure out their main modus operandi, it's game over for them.

            I think we have two layers to this whole sordid affair.
           </p>
           <p>
            First, the ruling class/elites want to *normalise *the idea of child abuse/abduction, so it's seen as widespread among the general public. They want the Average Joe to view their neighbour as a potential pedo, in other words. Classic divide and conquer. But also to gradually prime the general public to see it as a disease or a disorder. After that, it becomes a lifestyle choice.
           </p>
           <p>
            Secondly, the actual REAL abuse of the elites will occasionally be uncovered in cases like Pizzagate. It could be that Wikileaks itself is part of the system and they WANT us to know about Pizzagate, as they gradually come out into the open. They want to see how much they can get away with. They are torturing us, knowing how slowly the public reacts and how cowardly most people are.
           </p>
           <p>
            In other words...With the McCann case...Remember Cluesforum (www.cluesforum.info) has run some very in-depth threads exposing media hoaxes. Including NATO false flag serial shootings in the UK, Australia and the USA (over the last 30 years), used as a pretext for stricter gun control, where there were NO real victims. Similar to Sandy Hook.
           </p>
           <p>
            It's difficult getting to the truth. I have no doubt that Pizzagate is covering something very real. It's just that as you get deeper into this stuff, you have to apply a finer and finer toothcomb, to extract the truth from the fictional backdrop.
