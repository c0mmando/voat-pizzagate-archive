We should have all seen this coming a mile away, but no one in his crew spoke up for years while this went on. And this is what happens when a bunch of douchebag bros start a cool boys club posing as arty indie hipsters. Him and his crew were notorious for taking advantage of very young pretty women who were trying to be a part of the art, modeling, and music scene around 2009-2011. Beautiful, but naive girls who just wanted to be a part of something were exploited and taken advantage of left and right by these sorry excuses for men. Tom is not the only one out there, but he\'s probably the most notorious and prolific of them all. There are others who did the same kind of stuff. I hope his victims find some closure.&quot;</p>

I sure hope cops checked his fridge too. May be some body parts in there.&quot;</p>

            I linked to a video showing the OTO was supporting the movement to free the Cleveland 3 satanic ritual abusers (going through their social media) just like Johny Deep was who is an OTO kiddy fucker and best mate of hunter S Thompson

            Hunter S Thompson is praised by the Oregon OTO pedos on their social media and in their pedo pizza joints in Oregon. They are also all Masons too.

            Here's the Satanic Croph Dia band.. now where did I see his photo. Go over my Millenial_Falcon deleted reresearch.
           </p>
           <p>
            He's friends with a Garry Nelson who appears to be a video-ographer posting lots of weird kids photos too. could be an account renamed.

            Gotta go to work investigate the leads. This bastard is connected to the 2005 Legg Devine Case I talk about. Ask me privately for the details.

              in one of his arm tats you can see the symbol of a heart with 2 swords going thru it
Heart w/ 2 swords going thru it :
"he heart dagger tattoo is also a symbol associated with Erzulie Dantor, a Haitian spirit who, in many aspects, is the opposite of Mary. Despite being the spirit of spirit of love, beauty, jewelry, dancing, luxury, and flowers, her dark side reveals vengeance and jealousy. Basically, what I'm trying to say is that this symbol can be identified with the voodoo religion" -
             </p>
             <p>
              "prison talk. In the cells, a heart dagger tattoo means that the wearer is willing to kill. Outside the shutter, it only means 'love hurts'. But for guys like us who are fresh from the jail cells, it can only mean we will kill any motherfu**er who gets in the way of our dating lives."
" The dagger always implies something that can cut-- hurt, cause harm, dangerous, while the heart is always something tied to emotions and fragility. When a tattoo involves something stabbed by a dagger, it suggests the danger or the harm on something"
