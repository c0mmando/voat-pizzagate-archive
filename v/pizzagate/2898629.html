            I've literally just posted in the Standard Hotel thread currently on the first page of the Pizzagate sub by letsdothis3 regarding photos from an after party where one of the 'performance artists' has a book with Theban words in it. I translated it and it reads as follows (errors omitted and one word was unknown):
           </p>
           <p>
            <strong>
             "Magic is a tool of the subverted and oppressed for personal growth and confidence. It is a beautiful tragic necessity the maintenance of an _________ soul."
            </strong>
           </p>
           <p>
            That's an after party directly linked to DC, Transformer art gallery and Pizzagate players.

            So basically the Satanists got a statue of Satan put up in the town square of Salem, MA and the NYT jizzed in their pants (shocker! lmao). The decision to allow the satanists to put up their statue was allowed by a state judge. Then he goes off on a pretty based rant about the dems being satanists and harvesting organs but I‚Äôm too hungover to go into detail. Also loved that article he talked about where the teacher was fired for not calling a tranny by ‚Äúit‚Äôs‚Äù preferred pronouns üòÇ I feel for that teacher though. A mentally ill woman thinks she can slap a plastic cock on and become a man, and then has the gall to expect the rest of the world to play make-believe with her. I can only imagine the rage that teacher is feeling, that is some baby-back bullshit

            I can't make the audio play, a problem in my FF config recently. Does the host take a POV / position? How did the subject come up? Is he pro or con? I can easily imagine satanists, (((Special People))) and jerky atheists trolling Christians, "ha ha stupid goy! Look at the layout of the streets! The shape of the buildings! YOU are part of our temple, stupid breeder" etc.

           <p>
            When we use the debt currency system we are worshipping with Satan...
War shipping with Satan..
The accountting system of debt is a mere illusion we consent to and lend to..
This illusion or maaya based on legal defintions and construct ee r not aware of ..is run by our ignorance of it..
Our ignorance that we r increading debt everytime we loan ie deposit to banks and use Fed notes..
           </p>
           <p>
            When we use Caesars notes to aid Him in running the war game under licence of papal bull dum diversas...we end up using his money...
Hence.we have to abide by His rules and taxes...
Pay Surrender unto Casaer THAT is Casers ...
(he owns the running and adminiatration of the war anf its debt scrip legal tender)..
           </p>
           <p>
            We are the satanists believing in the illusionnor saytan mahaa mayaa that us sold by Caesars minions ..
Its an AI intelligence program ..
the more we feed it ..the more it asks from us...
           </p>
           <p>
            Stop feeding the machine..
Unfed the Fed and its notes..then u get out of the debt system ...anf align.and sureender with God..
Surrender unto God what is Gods..
Our names arr trust created at birth tracking and accounting for our sins ..ie debt credits..
When.we reduce debt at the US treasury ..we work and surrender to God and his trust mechanism..the accountants being the roman system..
           </p>
           <p>
            Inside the war wr seek wirk to gain grace ..
Outside the war we receive grace ie redemotion from.debt and then we can work or.provide service to God..ie work..
           </p>
           <p>
            The etmology of america is work ruler or.administrator..
           </p>
           <p>
            We provide surrender of the birth nammes credit to the Regis ..he will have to acknolwedge tye grace and redemption offered to us...they eill have to insure our lives...and redeem any bills in our name..
They become the trustees of the Christ account of which we r the beneficiary..
It is out of ignorance that we lend this infinite potential if grace into the war jurisdiction ...re siding inside Ceasars fictional crusade...
..which is really a battle if our selves agaimst our debt creating lower self...
           </p>
           <p>
            The use if children to create and rollover profits in the banking system is a direct result of us loaning our energy to the war and its templar banking system..
Instruct the US treasury to reduce debt then we will get out of Satan and Hell..
Legal defintion of Hell means debt ...
Ur name is a claim via the berth certificate against this debt ...
Google : what is namium
We should Stop wasting our time feeding Satan and its sytem and the gremlins that come out of it...and finding fault and judge them...that us for later ...
First the main priority is to get out of Her ...all it takes is a dollar..and Faith inChrist the double book entry system..that promises us redemption

             You need to proofread before you post. There are so many errors, colloquialisms, and nonsensicalities in your reply that it is unintelligible. That, or post sober. You come off DRUNK. I'd be interested in your words because this is a topic near to my heart, but as it is I have to downvote it, because...it's....crap.

              OK ..sorry about the mispellings...im using a mobile phone..and on a train...of thought ....
But arent we all living in a Miss spell...Babylon
Babylon is built on word magic..injected in our heads since berth , ie birth ...
Thats the gist of my comment ...that we r the satanists ...believers in the illusion called Saytan...
For example ...do u understand the legal definition of the word name ...and the legal and commercial consequences of not knowing its meaning...our ignorance of it being a birth trust literally runs this planet..
Its the first lesson we r taught at school..and repeated everyday from thenon...all across the planet ..
They call out ur name and surname and ask u to associate with it ..
John Doe ...present maadam..
We cast the spell in ourselves..since day one..
Its our state of ignorance that is running this civilisation..it is the fuel for the AI program that is the debt world...
             </p>
             <p>
              All we have to do to get out of it is to decrease debt at the Treasury...its a simple solution ...but to understand why that is the solution one has to understand their are two games being played..the war and peace with the playground for peace unoccupied..
We , by lending our name and credit to the war game we increase debt via the banking system and our consumption..consumption when u unspell it means to waste..
Both games have a debtor  a creditor and a surety ..
1. U choose ie consent to be the debtor in the war game as a citizen on its citizenShip..the word city denizen was used for merchants who were licenced and protected by the city to trade especially during war times..in this war game u trade ur body..the title to ur body ..ie the name 
2. The creditor is the state ...provides funny money for when u create a liability .ie it insures the charge against ur name...the state is an insurance pool of all citizens ..this is its main job as creditor INSIDE thr war game...to insure its debtor or city denizen when their is a failure of payment ..
Whe. U buy a cup of coffee and they charge the name , not u, ( the name is state property..but urs to play with , how u play determines which game u r playing) ..
Say the licenced shopkeeper charges the name 5 dollars ..as there is no real money (silver and gold.have been taken out of the payment system since 1930 ie after the great depression) in the system ... The state saves ie insures u by giving u remedy to use just a piece of paper to discharge the charge of 5 dollars..u pay a debt with a debt note...ie u shift liability onto the coffee shop..he then turns that debt note over to the state chartered bank and it turns into a credit entry ie..the bank owes him ..ie takes on the liability the state via the bank takes on the liability ..it records it as a credit entry on its liability side..
So no one is getting paid ..just liability is being shifted to the state ..when people buy goods and services as consumers..as citizens...
3. Who is the ultimate surety to this system..? Each individual holding the name ..u r merely a holder if the birth certficate ie u decide to act as trustee INSIDE the war game ..u use it as a game token..
When u buy a cup of coffee with a credit card..u instantly create and inject a record of debt in the banking system of 5 dollars ...u created that liability from a promise to pay in future..since there is no money in the system..u substitute payment of the 5 dollar credit ..by reducing the banks liability to the coffe shop who was credited...ie u debit ur account to the bank ie state ..by 5 dollars when u receive ur credit card bill..
             </p>
             <p>
              So the War system runs on us not taking responsibility and shifting debt onto the state ..whichbis merely a bookeeper via its bank...of the surety pool..( we r surety and we pool our credit onto the war..and also sef up the book keeper via voting a new board every 5 years ..
Its a board game that we should get bored of becasue we r increasing debt and making it worse for ourselves
             </p>
             <ol>
              <li>
               As surety we have another choice...get out of the surety pool..that supports this game ..and gurantees it via the constitution..
(the word constitutor means someone who shifts debt onto a third party..via statutues ie con + stituare. Its basically an insurance policy document the con + stitution for the surety to act as city denizens trafing inside the WAR board game..it doesnt give u right it merely guarantees it..ie provides u protection in return for u lending ur credit and name into this WAR game
              </li>
             </ol>
             <p>
              U have another choice if u find u r losing in this game..its called PEACE ..the opposite of War ..
In both games u r the surety..but in peace its a more powerful position because ur a direct surety with surety rights over the US treasury
To declare.peace u have to do the exact opposite of what u were doing inside the fictional debt War game..
U have to reduce debt at the treasury..inside the war u were indirectly increasing the states debt to u and  the surety pool and its accountant the state records this as.a credit on its books..
U take that credit and use it to reduce debt directly at the US treasury ..u now have surety rights directly over the US ..since u reduced its debt ie the surety pools accountants ie tye treasury records that u have decided to get out of the surety pool set up for war and r playing a game of peace from now on..
             </p>
             <p>
              Google : surety rights
             </p>
             <p>
              Now they have to upon ur instructiins as direct surety discharge all charges the war game creates for u..ie the US treasury becomes ur trustee and u become beneficiary of the berth trust..
             </p>
             <p>
              Its a simple.game ...u ask urself why didnt i go back to kansas early on...
We live in fear , becasue we buy into the banksters , the wicked witchs , fear porn ,when we r actually thr lion
We live without using our brain, because we allow us to be programmed like a straeman , using our name merely as a token..when it is actually surety of the whole system
We live without a heart, when we act as the tinman..we leave our intuition..and dont trust it..entrusting our livelihood to the war game and its banking system..
             </p>
             <p>
              All we have to do individually is to take our credit from the banks and hand it over to the treasury to use it to reduce debt at our bank...ie the US treasury..ie we liquidate the wicked witch of funds ..
             </p>
             <p>
              U now longer work and registe ur assrts to Ceasar for Ceasars war game ..u dont use ceasar funny money so u dont have to pay Him and follow his statutes..
U surrender to the peace game ..ie God..
We r the temple of God..the higher consciousness is what we will work for...this is why all businesses are called services...
We serve ...throughout our lives..because we own nothing ..not even our names..
The belief that we do is The illusion ie Saytan..
We built satan , by sreendering to our lower self.
We destroy satan by not feeding this illusion witb our credit..
If u have any doubt emaik the US treasury with an instruction to take say 5 dollars to reduce its debt ..they will respond in the positive. .trust me

              I think  the misspelling, which can be confusing, is on purpose.  Many misspell to avoid being attacked or a lawsuit or being audited by the IRS which probably doesn't even exist.  I do wish there was a much more clear explanation of this for us novices because it just gets all fuzzy when I read about it.  Yes, it really interests me and I wish I knew what I as a citizen needs to do, in a simple way, to get this started.  But thank God

               Thanks for the support..unfortunately all of the video and material out there talks about the problem but misses the solution ..
Nonetheless it does build up the understanding of the war we are occupying

Any accountant watching the video below will from the onset realise he has flipped the columns...

                Thanks.  will take a look  I am not the sharpest knife in the drawer when it comes to accounting stuff.  Always loved basic math and even loved dividing and other stuff, but beyond that it gets fuzzy.  But will look anyway.

                <p>
                 The trick is to simplify it ...its their job to complicate it..
Basic accounting:
Assets = liability +/or equity 
Equity is a liability towards the shareholder ..in the case of a trust , it will be towards the trustor and his trust and the beneficiary
                </p>
                <p>
                 When ur mother creates a trust for u ..ie the Name 
 The asset is the debt u owe Her ..
Trustor = mother 
Trustee = holder of thr birth certicate 
The first trustee is the State ..when it hands it to the Mother's name (another state property) the mother becomes the carrier of thr birth certifcate and trustee..
( this is why the State pays u child benefit )
The beneficiary is the child ie the flesh and blood u..
                </p>
                <p>
                 When u turn ..contracting age ...the State would like u to lend that asset ..ur name to it...to use to run its pirate debt game ..it requires ur consent ...
                </p>
                <p>
                 So u lend the equity side of the name trust to it...
The pirate state has a liability under papal bull dum diversas to run the papal war under war scrip..ie dollar..
This is why it asks u to lend ur energy, applications, credit to its banking system..
                </p>
                <p>
                 When u increase credit inside the war ..the banking system works to increase the debt ..thus creating a perpetual war ...
                </p>
                <p>
                 Instead if u take the credit ...and reduce debt at the US treasury ...u unlend urself from the war ..mand then become beneficiary of ur trust...
                </p>
                <p>
                 They have to protect u...
The pirate corporation protects u domestically via the guarantee of rights (funded by u ) via the constitution..
But as we relaise now ..that is easily corruptible..and is corrupt..
When we get out of the war...the US has an international obligation to protect u ..ie ur name as it is Roman property...
U r directly being protected..
U can then place charges on politicians and corrupt bereacrats under the jurisdictiionn of war on terror..chareable to the US treasury...
                </p>
                <p>
                 The US becomes ur internatiinal protector..
Thier business is war..

                <p>
                 They r just our biokkeeper...and follow our instructions..
If we lend to the war side ..and delegate responsibility for our lives to the war pirates...and decide to be irresponisble to our own estate or trust...runnig up a debt ...They have licence to be irresponsible...
                </p>
                <p>
                 When we decide to use our credit and asset to.run the US by reducing its debt and exercise direct surety rights over the bookkeeper...we ru. The war to achieve Peace..

               I agree. It does make sense when you delve that deep. Wow, what worms in the can.....

                They sure thought up one heck of a hidden secret but there is a trail to get out we just have to figure it out.  They of course won't ever tell us or have it printed anywhere, we have to discover the way out.  I guess you have to think of it like getting trapped in a maze.  A can of worms, yes.........it certainly is.
