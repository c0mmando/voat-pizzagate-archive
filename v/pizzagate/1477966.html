            i reckon it's worth looking into, wonder if Autumn Ratdke was going to out it all before her suicide, plausible lead since they have to launder money somehow, he was also a child actor for disney, maybe a disney/dc connection is needed

             why are you denying his involvement with BC? Brock Pierce is a CONFIRMED pedo. He is linked to crytocurrency (money laundering?) and the CGI.  If you're not a shill, please take some time and watch Open Secrets. Or BTFO.

               I have no idea, I just know Pierce is linked to cryptocurrency and heavily invested. He's also a confirmed pedo who never served time. That Open Secrets documentary is a MUST see. I think victor is having some confusion issues where "founder" means inventor, rather what OP means. No Pierce did not "invent" BC. But he was heavily involved "founding' websites and blockchain sites.
