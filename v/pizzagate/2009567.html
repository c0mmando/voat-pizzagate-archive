<p>In PEDOGATE: Pandora’s Box Has Been Opened for Deep State and the C.I.A.
Posted on March 14, 2017 by State of the Nation </p>
<p>&quot; However, it is Brussels, Belgium that has become the locus of intense pedophobic activity for many decades.  Over the centuries, some of the castles and chateaux surrounding Belgium came to be known as full-time child torture and murder factories.  Now we know why so many children go missing in Brussels every year.&quot; &quot;it should come as no surprise that Brussels was chosen as the de facto capital of the European Union.  How easy it is to lure so many leaders from all over Europe into criminal behavior they had no inclination toward. &quot;</p>
<p>&quot;When all of the locals are well aware that the local police will not investigate anything having to do with crimes against the children, something is quite awry.  And so it is in Brussels… and the surrounding countryside that is known for its small castles and quaint manors with their sprawling estates…on which to hunt.&quot; &quot;For the upper crust of society who has taken to hunting children, some of these large wooded areas have become ideal for keeping their criminal activity a well-guarded secret. In the modern era, many a snuff film has been made in these same environs.  The very culture of Brussels has literally grown up around this extremely twisted perversion of child exploitation.  So in a sense, it is all so out in the open, and yet no one can do anything about it.  Such is the purposeful collaboration with law enforcement authorities that the wealthy participants have always enjoyed. When the police chiefs themselves are also regular attendees at such criminal events, the protection of these child exploitation rackets is ensured&quot;

<p>&quot;Grand Master and Grand Chapter supervise Chapters in Spain, Portugal, Italy, England, Scotland, the Czech Republic and the Benelux countries in Europe. In the Americas, Chapters are located in the United States, Mexico, Argentina and a chapter is presently in formation in Canada. A chapter is also presently in formation in the Union of South Africa. The traditional headquarters of the Order is the principal residence of the Grand Master, currently the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg.&quot;

Int St Hubertus Order - bag of deer and wild boar - Schildfeld
gutted deer and boar laid out for viewing</p>
<p>The order operates under the patronage of Juan Carlos of Spain whose hunting skills perhaps have improved since 1956 when a gun he had in his hand discharged, killing his14 y.o. brother. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infante_Alfonso_of_Spain">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infante_Alfonso_of_Spain</a></p>
<p>The hunting resort Cibola in Texas is owned by John Poindexter, a prominent member of St. Hubertus Texas Chapter. The décor at the resort features devil images: <a href="https://fellowshipoftheminds.com/2016/02/27/devil-images-around-justice-scalia-at-cibolo-creek-ranch/">https://fellowshipoftheminds.com/2016/02/27/devil-images-around-justice-scalia-at-cibolo-creek-ranch/</a>    <a href="http://media.culturemap.com/crop/5d/cf/633x475/St._Huberto_Archduke_Andreas_Salvatore_Hapsburg-Lothringen_Christina_Girard_John_Poindexter8101.jpg">http://media.culturemap.com/crop/5d/cf/633x475/St._Huberto_Archduke_Andreas_Salvatore_Hapsburg-Lothringen_Christina_Girard_John_Poindexter8101.jpg</a></p>
<p>The American chapter was started in 1966 in Bohemian Club,San Francisco. The order was reconstituted in Europe after  WW2 by an American Lt. colonel in postwar Europe . Halvor O. Ekern, also happened to work later as a US diplomat : <a href="http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2006/apr/13/20060413-105220-5114r/">http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2006/apr/13/20060413-105220-5114r/</a></p>
<p>To recapitulate: one Belgian hunting circle with powerful connections above the law allegedly hunts children. Another hunting order in the US with ties to Belgium and royalty ,the American chapter started at the Bohemian club, hunts on large ranches in Texas and has comfortable connections with local law enforcement. So comfortable that a US Supreme Court Justice can die on a member\'s ranch and the death is pronounced over the phone, no autopsy. Members of St. Hubertus (see investiture videos) seem quite old, not athletic weekend hunters.  Do the two hunting groups\' activities ever overlap?</p>',

            John Poindexter who has 30,000 acres in Cibola wanted to buy an additional 46,000 of public land nearby (at $43/ac!)  to enlarge his dream of restoring the land to pre-settler conditions . However, he got derailed by environmentalists with complaints, one of which was : "The widow of a former director of the Texas Historical Commission testified that her husband and a team of archaeologists had seen numerous significant archaeological sites at Cibolo that had been damaged by Poindexter bulldozers. Bob Mallouf, the director of the Center for Big Bend Studies, confirmed to me that he’d recorded at least four such reports but added that Poindexter has promised to be more careful."http://www.bigbendchat.com/portal/forum/big-bend-national-park-qa/jon-poindexter-article/
           </p>
           <p>
            76,000 acres? Is he trying for his own little Luxembourg? What does bulldozer activity cover up?

            Cibola ranch is very near Marfa, TX (20 miles...).  Check out the pizza place in Marfa..very weird.  Then recall that James Alefantis purchased artistic underground bunkers for he and his friends.  The bunkers were created by an artist who lives in Marfa, TX called Donald Judd...I believe Podesta is also tied to Donald Judd.  Marfa is a WEIRD town..home of the Marfa lights, etc...well done on keeping this fresh...I think I wrote this up back in Dec'ish...not as good as you did though!

             This was all on the wet works map in Podesta emails as part of the script. This also occurred in testimony provided to the Australian court against Dr. Anthony Kidman described in details as human hunting parties where small children would be let loose in the woods naked running for their lives and hunted. Some caught and raped before being killed.

             Thanks for the Marfa info. Donald Judd 1928-1994, raked in a lot of money from his "art" : $20 million in proceeds from the sale went into an endowment intended to enable the Foundation to fulfill its mission" "Prices for Judd's works first peaked in 2002, when a group of six Plexiglas boxes sold for $4.2 million"

             Took his money and like Poindexter, created his little enclave in Texas: " 60,000 acre (243 km²) Ayala de Chinati Ranch (not open to the public), almost all carefully restored to his exacting standards. 40,000 acres surrounding the three ranch headquarters were sold under a conservation easement, but Judd Foundation still maintains the buildings and the land immediately surrounding them." "included the abandoned buildings of the former U.S. Army Fort D. A. Russell. The Chinati Foundation opened on the site in 1986 as a non-profit art foundation, dedicated to Judd"

             Had residences in NY, Marfa and Switzerland. Same playbook, same themes: isolated ranch, extravagant prices paid for "art" (pedophile currency), activity at military bases, foreign bank accounts, nonprofit status,et nauseum

            I was told that Justice Scalia was a member of that organization.

           <p>
            He died whiie vacationing with
members of that order.

            I head Dick Cheney sometimes attended meetings
of that order.  But I have not been able
to confirm that. I thought mostly Catholic Jesuit
