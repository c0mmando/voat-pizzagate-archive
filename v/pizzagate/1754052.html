            Nobody ever argues the fact that Jones has elaborated on what the elites do with children in their spare time, not a little bit, not  passionately, but in fact rabidly, and
            <strong>
             more than any other radio personality, living or dead,
            </strong>
            although David Icke would give him a run for the money. The reason this is never argued is because it is inarguable by anyone who has ever listened to Jones with any regularity, especially in the past. Those that do not listen to the show or instead watch compilations made by others continue to get their talking points from the CIA, which produced all that lovely Jones is gatekeeper/cointelpro/limited hangout/CIA/mossad asset material everyone falls for.
            <strong>
             Why Jones is the virtual Godfather
            </strong>
            of broadcasting the news that there is an epidemic of child sex trafficking and satanic torture.
           </p>
           <p>
            In less than 60 seconds, I produced the following list of stories or videos from Infowars regarding Jones's Herculean efforts to bring this news to a broader audience in the last two decades:

            Were I to make a comprehensive list, I would need the equivalent of probably 10 full VOAT pages and perhaps seven hours of spare time to produce it.
           </p>
           <p>
            <strong>
             Anyone claiming Jones is a gatekeeper for people who commit crimes against children is an embarrassment to humanity.
            </strong>
            There are lots of reasons why someone might not like Jones, and I get it because Jones has certainly made mistakes in the past, but to make heinous claims that he is part of a coverup is an outrage.
           </p>
           <p>
            If inclined, I could spend ten more minutes and produce unassailable proof that Jones was set up by Alefantis in such a way as to give Jones no alternative than to do retract, and show that Alefantis had admissible evidence against Jones that he did not have on any other well known personality talking about PG, but I am not going to waste my time because the worst of you cowards will deny it to the death anyway.

               His fans mistook him for an investigator, when actually he just painted a narrative - his own agenda in mind. People are speculating if his life was theatened? I am sure that is not the case, he is a cointelpro. He had stopped covering pizzagate since that hoax shooting. Day after Alex had that fake crisis actor who 'witnessed the shooting.' That was a retraction then. It was back in December 7. He has not touched the story and even if he did prior - He only covered what was viral at the time, Alex never broke the story, and no accusations. Alifantis has been off Alex's radar, and Alex has never gone back to the story, in fact when it popped up in a narrative he would always backtrack and say CPP was a distraction, not even mentioning the fact that it was in fact a whole network of pizza parlors and coffee shops, and a book store located within proximity of each other on the same street. Alex kept repeating MSM narrative so there was no need for theatrics. Alifantis could not threaten Alex for if Alex were real he would go public which is the last thing Alifantis would want. Alex is a cointelpro, a hired actor, always was. Bill Cooper had exposed Alex back in 2000. Bill was murdered in 2001, Nov5. Nobody went after Alex - he was a chosen disinfo agent, all is clear now. All his overacting and fake crying. In one Christmas episode he 'broke down crying' over all those lost children - it looked odd and creepy. It was odd enough for someone astute to have asked 'What's in your closet Alex?!'

             There are plenty of good people left on earth ready for a good fight. With Alex it's personal - I tuned in after 9-11. I practally followed him on a daily basis until he became Trump's cheeleader. He stopped covering false flags. He stopped reporting global events that have nothing to do with Trump, but this was the last straw. I believe he got bribed! Huge bucks $$$$$$!

              Alex pushed a limited hangout about 9/11. You have been following that long and don't know? You didn't know he was a fraud? Cointelpro gatekeeper and bad over actor? Fake voice? Sensationalist? He wasn't bribed, this is the script they gave him. He works for them.

               Everyone has an agenda. But a guy who I thought was a vehement anti pedophile suddenly apologizes to child murderer / cannibal - I am not alleging, I know exactly who Mr Ping Pong guy is, and I suspect Alex does too. This is the single worst betrayal he could have done. What made him do it? Is he just an actor? Cointelpro? I am in shock, my shelf is full of his DVD's and books. Must have watched hundreds of shows and this is what he does. I am sick to my stomach. Now I remember whenever I saw his fake crying and overacting....do these people have souls? I am livid.

             Your name is catchy. Death2Masons. Tell me what do you know about Masons? I am interested. (I don know quite a bit, maybe more than quite a bit) Since Freemasonry plays a huge part in this conspiracy, I will be posting threads on that and would love to hear your comments.

            Cowboy Joe is a disgrace for leveling these kinds of charges against Jones. Cowboy Joe boasts about Ted Gunderson??? Cowboy Joe is apparently oblivious to the fact that Gunderson was a frequent guest on Jones show, including episodes that discussed child trafficking, like this one
            <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQS5NXKaxeY">
             https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQS5NXKaxeY
            </a>
            Jones has been screaming louder and longer on radio about satanic child sex abuse than any other person ever to take to the airwaves, living or dead. If one child was saved for every time he mentioned what the elite do in their spare time with children, there would be no pizzagate. What an outrage to betray Jones this way. Jones made one calculated move on one specific point involving one specific person and all of a sudden Jones is an enabler. Jones parsed his words so carefully, virtually all other suspects (Podesta and Co., Clintons, etc.) remained suspects, but no one is willing to acknowledge this truth.
           </p>
           <p>
            After twenty-two years of relentless attacks on the deep state NWO satanic cabal, Jones has earned the right to make a retraction after consultation at this critical time. Nothing can erase Jones efforts in red pilling millions to everything wicked including child sex trafficking like Gunderson revealed on Jones show.

             Two days ago, the best video ever made about #pedogate:
             <a href="https://youtu.be/1amKxpZASiw?t=4m57s">

            </p>
            <p>
             Last night Jones was raising awareness, that the pedo-satanists/globalists implement censorship:
             <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/v/pizzagate/new">
              https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/new

            </p>
            <p>
             Pay attention how the shills V___Z, GeorgeT attack the messenger, not the scandalous development.
            </p>
            <p>
             They attack Jones because he is effective in redpilling people about the globalist agenda.

             Alex Jones is a fraud and his fans are either shills or slow on the upkeep. But these Youtube personalites that need to create a character are never helpful. I watched the first 10 seconds of him acting like a cartoon cowboy and that was enough for me. This subject does not deserve such childish theatrics.

             We know we are getting closer!  A message to Brock - if you gonna put trolls on a payroll at least set the bar a little higher. If you gonna send trolls, make it subtle, it's getting comical. Alex the cointelpro Jones who has supposedly infiltrated the Bohemian Grove and lived to tell the tale. Red pillers might have forgiven him for never mentioning Israeli mossad involvement in 9-11 but apologizing to creeps who post photos of toddlers with hashtag 'hotard' is where they draw the line! Everything he has ever done or will ever do will amount to nothing. Bill Cooper exposed him way back - we should have listened. 
Sorry Brock, you gonna have to enlist new breed of trolls.

                  The global pedophile networks are being exposed, Alex Jones is on the attack and repilling millions and you paid losers can do nothing about it.
Shills, you have lost control of the narrative.
It's wonderful.

            Cowboy Joe calls out Alex Jones urging viewers to do research for ourselves, to watch Dr.Phil's video, to check up great researches and whistle blowers like Ted Gunderson. Bottom line is that, pizzagate is not about one pizza parlor, or a slice of pizza, it is a gigantic network. Joe insists that Trump is a good man, quoting his Oct8 2012 tweet! But Joe goes on to say that Trump is just one man, surrounded by corrupt fiends that have sold their souls. Joe is urging us to awake and bring this abomination down. A great passionate speech by Cowboy Joe. To quote Joe in the end "Alex, anything else you might do from now on will amount to nothing.'

              But Trump is the only hope we've got. Had Killary won it was game over. Over 1500 arrests so far. Numbers speak louder than words. It's not much but we have to fight tooth &amp; nail for every tiny step we gain. That Ben Garrison's inspired cartoon depicted Trump with a draining machine. I don't believe that Ben believes that. But Trump is depicted as a symbol of hope and a symbol of an old adage that one man or a woman can make a difference.
