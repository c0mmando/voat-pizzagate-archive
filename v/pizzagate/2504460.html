<p>&quot;On March 31, 2014, 10-year-old Willie Myrick was abducted from his Atlanta, Georgia, driveway. 
The abductor allegedly lured Myrick with cash and when the boy got close enough, the man grabbed him and pulled him into his car.
The kidnapper drove around for three hours and Myrick sang the gospel song &quot;Every Praise&quot; repeatedly until the man got sick of hearing it and told him to get out of the car.<br />
Myrick said the kidnapper kept yelling at him and telling him to shυt up &quot;f*ck boy&quot;, but the boy refused.
&quot;He opened the door and threw me out. He told me not to tell anyone,&quot; Myrick said.
After hearing the story of how his song had potentially saved Myrick\'s life, the man who wrote &quot;Every Praise,&quot; gospel singer Hezekiah Walker, traveled from New York to Atlanta to meet the boy.
&quot;I really believe that God spoke through me to save that young man\'s life,&quot; Walker said.&quot;</p>
<p>BOY SANG THIS GOSPEL SONG UNTIL KIDNAPPER COULDN\'T TAKE HEARING IT ANYMORE AND SET HIM FREE

            Some more details about the kidnapper may help with the flair. For example: any crimes in the news involving a similar perp. Perhaps other survivors accounts could form a relevant addition to your report. How did the police respond? What statistics of child abductions relate to this?

             Evidently, this story went viral in 2014. Megan Kelly was still at Fox news when she reported on it. Here are 2 news reports on it with a sketch of the child abductor in it. I couldn't find any followup info on whether he was caught. The main focus of my post is on THE CHILD WHO GOT AWAY! Atlanta is a major hub for child trafficking.

             A great video interview with William Myrick. Gives lots of details and shows an artist's sketch of the kidnapper.

              Maybe these facts will convince the mod to remove the flair. Seems pertinent. Has it been mentioned here before? Well, you give it a worthy new context, either way.

               Ben, check out these videos:
A great video interview with William Myrick. Gives lots of details and shows an artist's sketch of the kidnapper.

               I can hypothetically see one way it could be related and that is via the Satanism/spiritual warfare angle. We have Satanic Ritual Abuse as part of the PG definition. If a kid faced down a pedo slave of the Dark Side by singing Gospel songs, it does add credence to the spirirtual warfare theory of Pizzagate.

                Thanks Vindicator! I agree. Perhaps Pizzagate warriors could try the same tactic. We could have Sasha Lord Presents: PIZZAGATE GOSPEL SINGERS perform in front of Comet Pizza. LOL!

           <blockquote>
            <p>
             Over the years Kelly has had multiple accusations of sexual misconduct leveled against him, including a 2008 case where he was acquitted on 14 charges of making child pornography; that case centered around a videotape that prosecutors alleged showed Kelly having sex with a 14-year-old girl. DeRogatis, who received the tape from an anonymous source in 2000 and turned it over to police, wrote the article that launched the investigation.
            </p>
            <p>
             The new report claims that the young women fell under Kelly’s sway after being brought to him by their parents in an effort to further their musical careers, but that he then “brainwashed” them.
According to parents and the former associates, Kelly:
            </p>
            <ul>
             <li>
              keeps several young women at his homes in Atlanta and Chicago;
             </li>
             <li>
              replaces their cell phones with ones specifically used to communicate with him and forbids them to contact their families;
             </li>
             <li>
              requires they call him “daddy” and ask permission to leave the studio or their residences;
             </li>
             <li>
              films their sexual encounters with him;
             </li>
             <li>
              abuses them physically and verbally
             </li>

             R Kelly is asked (about halfway into the video): “Is it really true that you are attracted to teenage girls?”
Kelly: “Well, how old is ‘teenage’?”

             Thanks for the research. I did not know anything about Walker, nor do I follow the hip hop culture.
What seems to be true, is that the little boy was delivered from a very bad situation by singing the song. GOD WORKS IN MYSTERIOUS WAYS! What Satan means for evil, God can use for good! Just so glad the boy was rescued. I had a divine rescue from a pedo kidnapper myself, so the story caught my attention. Praise God!

             We know about Kelly. But the evidence on Combs is false as far as I could find with substandard evidence thrown out there.
            </p>
            <p>
             You mention Kelly, yet did not even post an fake news site for "Diddy" accusation. If deflecting, make it less fake so we can try to believe your integrity.
