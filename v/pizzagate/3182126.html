<p>THE CONGOLESE AREN\'T FOOLED:
&quot;Congo\'s Ebola response threatened by conspiracy theories, rumors&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;People who have contracted Ebola are opting to die at home rather than seek treatment as conspiracy theories fuel distrust of the government and of health workers grappling with the crisis in the Democratic Republic of Congo, according to the workers and aid groups.&quot;
&quot;In addition to combating a lethal virus, health workers are having to dispel rumors that the disease is manufactured and that the millions of dollars spent on the response are part of a money-making scheme derisively referred to as the “Ebola business.”
&quot;We have lost the trust of the community,&quot; Tariq Riebl of the nonprofit International Rescue Committee told NBC News from Goma.
A study conducted in September, less than two months into the outbreak, found that 25 percent of people surveyed in the affected areas did not believe Ebola was real, while 36 percent thought it was fabricated to destabilize the region.
“It’s all about money, that we’re getting bonuses for cases we find, that prolonging the response helps the business side,” Riebl said&quot;
&quot;Ebola treatment centers established by the central government in conjunction with international aid groups have been met with suspicion. Designed to isolate and treat suspected cases of Ebola and staffed by health workers wearing bulky “space suits,” the centers come with an increased presence of police and military forces.
Some people in Butembo even believe that &quot;when you go there they inject you with the disease,&quot; according to Vahavi, 30, who collects data for a Congolese nonprofit.&quot;
&quot;On Friday, the World Health Organization said an Ebola doctor was killed in an attack on Butembo University Hospital.
Hours later attackers armed with machetes tried to burn down another treatment center, the city\'s deputy mayor said Saturday.
Two centers run by Doctors Without Borders, along with the Ministry of Health, were attacked three days apart in February, forcing health workers to suspend operations.&quot;
&quot;Ebola was confirmed by the World Health Organization on Aug. 1, months before the country was set to head to the polls. &quot;</p>
<p>KEY: &quot;He’s more optimistic now that the elections have taken place, saying that a VACCINATION campaign — which reached more than 100,000 people in the Ebola-effected region — has been effective.&quot;

<p>LEVEL 1 EBOLA VACCINE TRIAL (2014) FUNDED BY WELLCOME TRUST:</p>
<p>&quot;Ebola Vaccine Trial begins in Kilifi</p>
<p>Researchers at the KEMRI| Wellcome Trust Research Programme in Kilifi, Kenya, have started the human testing of a vaccine designed to protect against Ebola. The first dose of the VSV-Ebola vaccine was administered to a health worker on Wednesday December 17, 2014 at the Kilifi County Hospital.</p>
<p>The Phase 1 trials are part of a wider World Health Organization (WHO) led consortium (VEBCON) funded by the Wellcome Trust.  These trials, and other trials that are taking place in the USA, Germany, Switzerland and Gabon, will test the vaccine’s safety and its ability to generate an immune system response in healthy adults. The vaccine is administered as a single dose after which the participants will be monitored closely.  Early trial results will be provided in February 2015.</p>
<p>The VSV- Ebola vaccine was made by combining the Vesicular Stomatitis Virus (VSV) with a portion of a single protein covering the Ebola virus. 
(NOTE: THIS IS A GENETICALLY ENGINEERED VIRUS WITH AN EBOLA PROTEIN ADDED ON. What could go wrong?) The vaccine can therefore generate an immune response to Ebola but since it only contains an isolated component part of the Ebola virus it cannot cause a vaccinated individual to become infected with Ebola, or to test positive for Ebola. (NOTE: How do you know it works?)</p>
<p>These trials are led by Dr. Patricia Njuguna, Dr Benjamin Tsofa and Prof. Phillip Bejon who are the Principal investigators.  Explaining the approval process the Director KEMRI Prof. Solomon Mpoke said “The approvals were fast-tracked by KEMRI and the Pharmacy and Poisons Board so that a 6 to 7 months approval process was conducted in only 6 weeks” He also noted that while the VACCINE TRIALS WERE BEING FAST-TRACKED the safety of the VOLUNTEERS would remain key.</p>
<p>The trials target HEALTH WORKERS due to their first line contact with Ebola patients.  Health workers are easier to communicate with regarding the trial due to their knowledge of how vaccines work, however seminars and information sheets have been used by the trial investigators to educate prospective participants on potential risks.</p>
<p>Although there are no cases of Ebola reported in Kenya, demonstrating safety and immune responses by the vaccine in the Kenyan population will facilitate use of the vaccine if necessary.  After these Phase 1 trials, the next step will be to TEST THE VACCINE FURTHER in the countries affected by the Ebola outbreak.&quot;

<p>CDC/ DOD EBOLA PATENT
&quot;Vaccine company has $140 million contract with Department of Defense to develop Ebola jab
This patent, which Hodges recently posted on his website, reveals that the CDC claims ownership over Ebola, meaning it can also claim royalties on the distribution and sale of Ebola vaccines. The DoD is also in on the scam, having contracted with Tekmira Pharmaceuticals Corporation, a leading RNA interference therapeutics developer, to develop a vaccine for Ebola.
But this is hardly a recent development -- the government has been working with multinational corporations like Tekmira to develop vaccines for Ebola since prior to 2006, long before the current outbreak. Bill Gates has also invested heavily in the development of such vaccines, footing $50 million in &quot;aid&quot; to the United Nations to &quot;fight Ebola.&quot;
This fight, of course, is more of a commercial endeavor rather than a humanitarian one, as evidenced by the various partnerships involved. Gates, Monsanto and others quietly invest &quot;seed&quot; money to initiate product development; the government and media play along by hyping whatever crisis is needed to generate demand for the product; and at just the right time, the vaccine is launched and millions are subjected to it.&quot;</p>
<p>NIH EBOLA VACCINE PATENT:</p>
<p>&quot;In this case, both the CDC and the National Institutes of Health (NIH) are among the key players in promoting the Ebola vaccine. While the CDC owns the patent on Ebola itself, the NIH owns the patent on Ebola vaccines. As it turns out, the NIH has collaborated with the Vaccine Research Center (VRC), a division of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), and Crucell, another vaccine developer, to commercialize an Ebola vaccine in the very near future.&quot;   <a href="https://www.naturalnews.com/046941_Ebola_virus_patents_vaccines.html">https://www.naturalnews.com/046941_Ebola_virus_patents_vaccines.html</a></p>
<p>DOCTORS WITHOUT BORDERS/ WELLCOME TRUST</p>
<p>(2014) &quot;Doctors Without Borders/Médecins Sans Frontières(MSF) announced today that it will host clinical trials in three Ebola treatment centers in West Africa. The separate trials, which are aimed at quickly finding an effective therapy that can be used against the disease, which has so far taken around 5,000 lives in the current outbreak in the region, will be led by three different research partners....the University of Oxford will lead, on behalf of the International Severe Acute Respiratory and Emerging Infection Consortium (ISARIC), a Wellcome Trust-funded trial of the antiviral drug brincidofovir at a site yet to be determined. The World Health Organization (WHO) and health authorities of the affected countries are also taking part in this collaborative effort.&quot;

              Bill Gates, the Royals, Bill C, Bono and Clooney are all making money across the globe pushing vaccines, imo.  When will people learn to stop spending money on their crap?  The Carter Foundation is another one.  No wonder people in Africa have so many Children, they are killing them as fast as they can have them. Why don't their planes ever crash?

            The Rockefeller’s owned the lab and patents for making false and deadly viruses. HIV or AIDS, H1N1, Ebola, sars, the virus in Brazil that made pregnant women’s babies deformed are just a few thanks to these evil pieces of shit.

             :

           </ul>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             "The person most interested in adopting Sweetie Sweetie is a young health care worker who treated her mother and said the mother’s dying wish was for him to look after the little girl.
            </p>
            <p>
             His name is Usman Koroma, and when he was tracked down at a rundown teachers’ college in Port Loko and asked if he knew a girl known as Sweetie Sweetie, the first thing he said was: “She’s mine.”
            </p>
            <p>
             He explained, in what seemed an eager but heartfelt way, how he had fed her extra portions of rice, oranges, soup and cassava porridge in the clinic, to boost her immunity.
            </p>
            <p>
             “I loved the child,” he said.
            </p>
            <p>
             Musa Conteh, a government social services officer who has been helping with Sweetie Sweetie’s case, was suspicious at first.
            </p>
            <p>
             “When this girl was discharged,” Mr. Conteh said, “there were a lot of guys standing around, saying they wanted to take her, because look at her, she’s nice.”
            </p>
            <p>
             When asked what he meant by that, Mr. Conteh dropped his voice close to a whisper.
            </p>
            <p>
             “This is a fluid time,” he said. “You never know.” He said that the authorities had to be on guard for any signs of strangers adopting children for the purposes of trafficking.
            </p>
            <p>
             But the more he listened to the young health care worker, the more Mr. Conteh seemed reassured. “We will keep investigating,” Mr. Conteh said. “But this man is educated. He can give her a new life.”

             Ebola-hit children in Sierra Leone go hungry amid food shortages: charity
Reuters Nov. 7, 2016
            </p>
            <p>
             "DAKAR (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Thousands of Ebola orphans, teenage mothers and children in charge of households in Sierra Leone are struggling to feed themselves and their families amid widespread food shortages in the West African nation, a British charity said on Monday.
While most families devastated by Ebola have received humanitarian aid, at least 1,400 children orphaned by the epidemic urgently need support, according to Street Child."
            </p>
            <p>
             "The Ebola epidemic left more than 12,000 children orphaned while at least 18,000 teenage girls became pregnant during the outbreak, according to the U.N. Population Fund (UNFPA).
"A collapsed economy that is no longer propped up by the aid given during and immediately after Ebola means that life is very hard for everyone," Dannatt said, adding that more people may go hungry and more girls may be forced to sell sex to afford food."

             I'll do some digging over the weekend.Traffickers seem ready to exploit almost any crisis. I personally visited Haiti (with a group of doctors/nurses who were actually Christians) during the AIDS epidemic. I saw first-hand the orphan situation. 4 year olds were caring for 2 year-olds. A disease outbreak can disrupt many lives all at once, just like war.

A reader reported that a man who was with her got out of the car and went inside the restaurant to pick up a take-out order. Another man was in the back seat of her black Mercedes. Snyderman had sunglasses on and had her hair pulled back, the reader said.

             The big red flag to me as a microbiologist is that ebola is a supposed “zoonostic parasite” yet there was never a true positive ID of the resevoir species after 30+ years.
            </p>
            <p>
             Compare with Hanta where the CDC had that thing figured out within a few weeks.

              Exactly. I think it was engineered from an already existing hemorrhagic fever virus. Initially, it was too virulent. Just my opinion.

              "The Terrifying Story Of How Ebola Once Escaped Africa And Landed In Europe" Jul. 31, 2014, 1:43 PM
             </p>
             <p>
              "But as it turns out, Ebola already jumped from Africa to Europe once before — 20 years ago. Here's the story behind the strange case."
             </p>
             <p>
              "In 1994, several chimpanzees were found dead and decomposing in Taï National Park, in the Côte d'Ivoire. On November 16 of that year, three researchers who had been studying the park's community of chimps wanted to figure out what was happening, so they dissected the body of one who had been dead for less than 12 hours."
             </p>
             <p>
              ""They found signs of hemorrhage and non-clotting blood," a case report, published in the Journal of Infectious Diseases, explains. "Eight days later, 1 of the researchers, a 34-year-old woman, became ill.""
             </p>
             <p>
              "The woman, a Swiss zoologist, started "shivering with fever," and thought she had come down with malaria."
             </p>
             <p>
              "Ebola hadn't emerged in Africa in 15 years, and never been detected in the region — and, in any case, doctors still suspected malaria."
             </p>
             <p>
              "Doctors checked her for parasites and didn't find any. They rehydrated her and administered antibiotics. But her condition didn't improve...That's when a dramatic decision was made: She would be flown out of the Côte d'Ivoire and back to Switzerland."
             </p>
             <p>
              "they suspected it could be Lassa fever, a hemorrhagic fever similar to (though generally less deadly than) Ebola. The Swiss Air Ambulance jet that transported her took extensive precautions."
             </p>
             <p>
              "In December 1994, they launched an epidemiological investigation to try to determine what had been killing the chimpanzees in the park — including the chimpanzee the zoologist had dissected. An analysis concluded that it was "a highly lethal epidemic with hemorrhagic syndrome," though the possibilities were still somewhat broad: "a viral infection of unknown origin, anthrax, dengue, and African hemorrhagic fevers" were all considered."
             </p>
             <p>
              "Researchers isolated the virus from the patient's serum sample and found something surprising: a novel version of the Ebola virus, one that had never been seen before. They dubbed it the Côte d'Ivoire strain (EBO-CI), also called the Taï Forest strain.What's more, they found the very same virus in the organs of the chimpanzees. "
             </p>
             <p>
              "The Taï Forest strain has not been found in humans since her infection 20 years ago."

            Ebola is a suspected bioweapon.

            Note that head shill (((AreWeSure))) shilled the hell out of this thread. Ebola being a bioweapon must be true if he stuck his nose in it.

              Overwhelming numbers is true, but most of them are either benevolent (actively help their host) or harmless.
             </p>
             <p>
              In fact, there’s research suggesting that these benign/harmless bacteria play an important role in normal immune system function (acting as a primer to prevent an excessive response). Some of the benign ones will try to fight the bad ones by releasing toxic compounds that the host is highly resilient to at the concentrations present (hydrogen peroxide for example).
             </p>
             <p>
              Further data indicates that people who lose these native bacteria have a MUCH higher chance of developing hyper sensitivity and auto immune diseases. Likely linked to misuse of antibiotics (do NOT distinguish friend from foe in terms of bacteria).

             Even before the 2014 outbreak, I had researched the original 1970's outbreak which occurred in the same area, then known as the "colonial" ruled Belgian Congo. Ebola had never been seen before, but had characteristics of hemorrhagic fever, was quite virulent with a 100% death rate. Because it quickly killed the host, it did not spread very far. Patient 0 came down with it after visiting a Belgian health clinic for a (think) malaria shot. They tried to pin it on a monkey virus that "jumped,"  but African monkeys are often used for research. Later, a less virulent strain showed up in other areas with a lower kill rate, but with an increased infection rate. Ebola spreadability peaked with the 2014 outbreak:
            </p>
            <p>
             "“Your Majesty, Ladies, and Gentlemen. It is now almost 40 years ago since the so-called Ebola Virus Disease (EVD) was discovered. We speak of 1976 and it was a young and devoted Belgian doctor, Peter Piot, who identified the virus in the village of Yambuku, in today’s Democratic Republic of Congo.
            </p>
            <p>
             Four decades have passed since then and the Ebola virus has struck communities on various occasions, each time in a harsh and cruel way. These epidemics somehow always ended after a few months of time and did not seem to result in a truly systemic crisis. Or at least, this is how the international community had perceived it up until last year.
            </p>
            <p>
             2014 became the year of the global wake-up call. Most probably it was a two-year-old boy in the town of Guéckédou, in Guinea, who was the first victim of the current Ebola epidemic. He already died in 2013, on December 6th to be more precisely. Things went very fast then and it was the organization Médecins Sans Frontières who first sounded the alarm. Being active in the field and on Ebola for many years, they had never seen an outbreak of the virus with such dimensions."
            </p>
            <p>
             The African journalist of this article has his own ideas about the cause of both HIV and Ebola:
            </p>
            <p>
             "Was De Croo trying to hide something or because there were many celebrities, including the queen at the conference? Because De Croo failed to mention the role of Hillary Koprowski and Belgium nurses and doctors who deliberately sprayed contaminated vaccine into the mouths of the poor and innocent Congolese, which later gave birth to Ebola and other deadly diseases."
            </p>
            <p>
             "That was a pity because Michel should have known the date of scientific literature of the criminal pharmaceutical, medical and corrupt (African) politicians, who also knew Aids and Ebola were man-made diseases, just as the Western World, Russia and Japan, and two top Belgium scientists, Guido van der Groen and Peter Piot knew of the medical crimes."
            </p>
            <p>
             "But during the African Ebola crisis, the only thing Belgium really did was to let the Council of Ministers approved the deployment of a mobile laboratory in Guinea to fight the spread of the Ebola epidemic. The government of France received the expected guarantees for the safety of the Belgian team."
            </p>
            <p>
             "Belgium History About The So-Called First Ebola Outbreak in 1976.
            </p>
            <p>
             Once in 1976, a research team had been formed, including a special Belgian Aids researcher, to meet at the Antwerp Prince Leopold Institute of Tropical Medicine. To their surprise, they didn’t find only members of the American National Institute of Health but also many others, including the director of the American National Institute of Allergy and Infection Diseases NIAID, and surprisingly the director Peter Piot of the Prince Leopold Institute itself.
            </p>
            <p>
             The highly experienced doctors at the American Center For Disease Control had enrolled an unfamiliar epidemiologist from Johns Hopkins Hospital, who told them exactly how the investigation in Zaire should be given. The plan is to hide the result of the investigation from the public as a medical crime. The outcome of the research remained a mystery because the results are never published."
