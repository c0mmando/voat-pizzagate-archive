            He seemed like he was "channeling " evidence into his mind. Not saying he wasn't abused himself but his videos are definitely on the spirit crystal side

            He is the one claiming stuff against Mike Pence. I have watched his videos many times. I don't want to believe it. Who knows what is truth anymore?

            I landed on his stuff recently and noticed that too.
            <br/>
            I like him   but  I can't trust his information,  based on the same  conclusions as you.
           </p>
           <p>
            It'll be interesting to see how much corroborates with actual fact.

            RIP Tory Smith.
