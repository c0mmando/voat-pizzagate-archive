           Haiti has a well known system for this known as "restavek," which is Creole for "to stay with."  However, there is also a related term for these kids, particularly females, which is "there for that" because so many end becoming sex slaves.(

            I know someone who witnessed firsthand when they were younger, decades ago. I was told the story years ago, as well. They went to Haiti on a "mission trip" as they were there with their church group to do faith work, and a woman ran up to them and handed them her baby. The person instinctively took the baby into their hands so it wouldn't be dropped, and then the woman ran away. They had to find another native that would take the baby back from them. Of course this is just my anonymous story on the internet, but it has definitely struck me over the past few weeks how I didn't understand anything about Haiti and the child trafficking back then when I first heard that story from this person. Old memories forever seen differently now.
