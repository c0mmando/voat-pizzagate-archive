             take the Vanguard Group. It’s the world’s largest mutual fund company. Corporations, smaller funds, and individuals place their money into the pot, and Vanguard takes it wherever it wants to go.
            </p>
            <p>
             With 14,000 employees in offices in the US, Europe, and Asia, Vanguard manages $2 trillion in assets.
            </p>
            <p>
             At the moment, it’s the biggest shareholder in Monsanto, the biggest in Halliburton, the second biggest in Facebook, the third biggest in Whole Foods, the second biggest in Hain Celestial Foods, and the biggest shareholder in the largest defense corporation in America, Lockheed Martin.
            </p>
            <p>
             Ready for a little head-spinning whiplash? To get a more personal glimpse of the inter-connected spider web of investment funding, here are a few Dick Cheney connections that Maggie Burns, writing in The Progressive Populist (2003), pointed out. Then I’ll add my own.
            </p>
            <p>
             Dick Cheney headed up Halliburton from 1995 to 2000. As US Vice President, he had to divest himself of his stake in the company. The exact figure is hard to pin down, but he put somewhere between 18 and 87 million dollars in the Vanguard Fund. Well, it just so happened that Vanguard, in that general time period (2003), was the 10th largest mutual-fund investor in Halliburton. So Cheney, indirectly, still had a stake in in his former company.
            </p>
            <p>
             In 2003, the 8th largest shareholder in Halliburton was Deutsche Bank. Who had worked in a prominent position at Deutsche a few years earlier? Alvin Buzzy Krongard, who would become the “number three man at the CIA under Bush.”
            </p>
            <p>
             There is much to say about Krongard (search articles re insider trading just before 9/11). Here I would point out he was a moving force, along with CIA Director George Tenet and Norm Augustine (Lockheed Martin), in creating In-Q-Tel, a CIA front company designed to fund new technologies in the private sector.
            </p>
            <p>
             In-Q-Tel bankrolls the development of these technologies so the US intelligence community can turn around and utilize them.
            </p>
            <p>
             How did a little start-up called Facebook get its bankroll?
            </p>
            <p>
             Jim Breyer, head of Accel, attached a $13 million rocket to it, and nothing has ever been the same. Earlier that same year (2004), a man named Gilman Louie joined the board of the National Venture Capital Association of America (NVCA). The chairman of NVCA? Jim Breyer.
            </p>
            <p>
             Gilman Louie happened to be the first CEO of In-Q-Tel.
            </p>
            <p>
             That’s not the only connection between Jim Breyer and the CIA’s man, Gilman Louie. In 2004, Louie went to work for BBN Technologies, headed up by Breyer. Dr. Anita Jones also joined BBN at that time. Jones had worked for In-Q-Tel and was an adviser to DARPA, the Pentagon’s technology department that helped develop the Internet.
            </p>
            <p>
             Just to add another thread to the spider web, who is the 4th largest shareholder in Deutsche Bank today? The Vanguard Group.
            </p>
            <p>
             I could go on, but you get the idea. This is what “they’re well-connected” means.
            </p>
            <p>
             In the world of investment funding and shareholding, it’s about connections.

            . I'm going to go ahead and remove the Rule 1 flair, thanks to this:
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             Fusion GPS was also the shadowy Democrat “dirty tricks” group hired by Planned Parenthood to produce the fake forensic analysis that supposedly “debunked” the Center for Medical Progress’ undercover videos. The series of CMP videos released in 2015 showed Planned Parenthood executives haggling over the best price for aborted baby body parts.
            </p>
            <p>
             In much the same way Fusion GPS’s fake Trump dossier served as the basis to support FISA warrants seeking to spy on Carter Page, their fake forensic analysis was used by the National Abortion Federation to serve as the basis for a request for a federal gag order on the release of future CMP baby parts videos that was granted by Judge William Orrick.
            </p>
           </blockquote>
           <p>
            Okay, so if I understand all this correctly, it looks like Ford is relevant to PG both because she may be an MKUltra puppet if her dad is CIA, and because her brother's firm helped Planned Parenthood squash the baby body parts videos via Fusion GPS. That's certainly enough to leave this up so people can keep digging. Thanks for all the hard work! Removing the flair, and changing it to "Potential Lead".

             Only my gut feeling but think this is related to Pizzagate because we’re watching live sacrifice. I think Christine Blasey Ford’s handlers turned her out. I absolutely believe she’s a victim. I believe she’s being exploited. I think the cabal is sacrificing her sanity while televising for political gain.

            Christine Blasey Ford is a psych who is involved with Corcept Pharmaceuticals, makers of RU486 the abortion pill. She was involved in numerous drug secrets being exfiltrated to Pakistan for Imran Awan according to George Webb. Corcept wanted to use RU486 for depression which would obviously mean millions of women would be having silent abortions. The main reason is to use it as a patch in compromise ops involving young CIA girls. Her dad and granddad were in the CIA, her dad ran compromise parties. That is why she is accusing Kavanaugh. I'm sure that they have numerous videos of Kavanaugh drunk, or on drugs, or perhaps having sex with people, whether or not he ever raped Christine. She was a CIA kid so he sold her out for compromise ops. Christine's dad Ralph (I think) Blasey is invested in low light camera companies and Datawatch. Sessions and Rosenstein recommended his nomination to Trump. This whole nomination is a deep state op to destroy Trump and the right wing. It works for their coup. How Trump didn't know any better is a really huge question for me.
           </p>
           <p>
            I learned this from listening to George Webb over the past week.
           </p>
           <p>
            Just go to his YT channel, he says that Blasey has 18 people waiting in the wings to accuse Kav. They willl use this to stretch out the drama and appeal to the metoo movement until the midterms. They may use it to either impeach Kavanaugh if he is confirmed or to keep that seat empty for the next two years.
           </p>
           <p>
            George said Trump should withdraw his nomination and nominate someone named Amy Barrett or something like that.
           </p>
           <p>
            Feinstein's office perpetrated a fraud when they leaked a fake letter obviously not written by Ford. And they're scamming the public with fake tears for someone who is running a CIA front. This is not about Kavanaugh. It's just a coup to protect the abortion industry and the Democratic wing of the deep state. I don't think Cruz voted to advance the vote, he is CFR and his dad was supposedly part of the JFK assassination. This is a CIA deep state LARP

              In 2009, Goldline incorrectly labeled Glenn Beck as a "paid spokesman" on its website which raised concerns with his employer, Fox News, which prohibits such a relationship; they later corrected it to "radio sponsor". Goldline's then–CEO Mark Albarian has appeared on Beck's radio show, the company was the exclusive sponsor of Beck's 2009 comedy tour. Prior to his Fox News employment, Beck had appeared in a Goldline website video.

            <p>
             There are connections via rotterham, FIFA, And the Obama administration. One of the uglier things that stood out was that these pakistani connections were investigated by Orbis Business Intelligence over FIFA bribes. Orbis business intelligence is owned by Christopher Steele, the man behind the piss dossier.

            <p>
             Its a very deep rabbit hole. It appears that pakistani organized crime is heavily involved in drug trafficking, bribery in the middle east, and human trafficking. They expanded greatly during the war on terror, because apparently they got a huge infusion of cash from western governments.

             Stephens benefited from the firings at the DOJ by moving to Honeywell and then Raytheon while the Clinton Foundation benefitted by accepting money from these two companies beyond the normal scope of lobbying. That is exactly what the Clinton Foundation is designed to do and it is illegal. The Clinton Foundation is a clone of the American Security Council Foundation, run by miners, that traded political influence for money. The Bush family had a similar political trade machine, though they did a better job of obscuring it by using more than just one central foundation to coordinate.

             How are the mighty fallen!  The saint who raised more than £40 million for charity and who was hailed as a national treasure by no less than Prince Charles possibly has his reputation in tatters only a couple of months after Dreweatt’s auction of his effects.

              The consoles in question featured The Rock's own Brahma bull logo alongside a personalised holiday message. Even better, the consoles were gifted a full week before the launch - making this exclusive experience all the more special for the Make-A-Wish recipients.

              Of course it wouldn't be a gaming event without a little in-game throw down action. The kids chosen were able to put their skills to the test by going up against Dwayne Johnson himself in a few different titles, including Killer Instinct and Forza Motorsport 7. Gorgeous car rides, private tours of the film - even specialised director chairs for the kids themselves - the event was extraordinary and goes to show the phenomenal work that Make-A-Wish does for terminally ill kids.

             *From an online source:
            </p>
            <p>
             Many people are commenting on the unusual coincidence of her brother Ralph G Blasey III working previously for the same firm, Baker &amp; Hostetler LLP that the Daily Caller reported as having had paid a company called Fusion GPS seven payments totaling more than a half million dollars in 2016.
            </p>
            <p>
             Fusion GPS is better known as the producer of the fake Russian dossier on then-candidate Donald J. Trump.
            </p>
            <p>
             Fusion GPS was also the shadowy Democrat “dirty tricks” group hired by Planned Parenthood to produce the fake forensic analysis that supposedly “debunked” the Center for Medical Progress’ undercover videos. The series of CMP videos released in 2015 showed Planned Parenthood executives haggling over the best price for aborted baby body parts.
            </p>
            <p>
             In much the same way Fusion GPS’s fake Trump dossier served as the basis to support FISA warrants seeking to spy on Carter Page, their fake forensic analysis was used by the National Abortion Federation to serve as the basis for a request for a federal gag order on the release of future CMP baby parts videos that was granted by Judge William Orrick.
            </p>
            <p>
             Obviously, Ralph Blasey III ended his tenure with Baker &amp; Hostetler long before the payments to Fusion GPS were recorded, but the connection is disturbingly coincidental.
            </p>
            <p>
             Does Blasey sill have contacts inside Baker &amp; Hostetler? Was Fusion GPS involved in some way with bringing forth Ford’s scandalous allegations against Kavanaugh?
            </p>
            <p>
             I believe I have answered the first question.
