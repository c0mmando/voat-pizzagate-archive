            Stop waiting a learn to dig. Trump and his media friends love using this tactic to put their enemies of their heels, but once any big arrest is made, they lose that 'trump' card.
           </p>
           <p>
            Remember, though, that allegations against Bryan Singer and David Geffen are being taken seriously when people wouldn't listen to them previously. We are being rewarded for the movement we maintained and built over a year.
           </p>
           <p>
            Also, big news outlets will sometimes make big warnings to figure out who is afraid, who is spreading disinfo etc, and can gain new information. We are winning; just don't expect others to do the dirty work for you.

             Well, this was my main point.  I've been working as much as I can and after the first year I reached a point of almost exhaustion. I am more lifted up now, raising issues where I can. But Occam's Razor is at play. If it looks like Jeff Sessions isn't doing shit - about pedogate he most likely is not. 
I am hopeful that Congress is actually going to be letting the country know what's up. I doubt they can get anything done.
Again, with less than five hours left in the day, nothing big happened. 
And your final two words are really relevant. Start waiting. That's what's happening
