<blockquote>
<p>When politicians start saying something like it’s “For the Children” run and hide your wallet asap.</p>
<p>TGP: Florida – Democrat State Senator, Lauren Book helped pass a bill that allocated $1.5 million to a nonprofit that she founded. She also gets paid a six-figure salary by this nonprofit.</p>
<p>Judicial Watch: A Democrat Florida state lawmaker helped pass a bill that allocated $1.5 million to a nonprofit that she founded and pays her a six-figure salary and the state’s Republican governor approved it. The legislator, state Senator Lauren Book, represents South Florida’s Broward County and in 2007 she founded a charity called Lauren’s Kids to educate adults and children about sexual abuse prevention through school curricula, awareness campaigns, and speaking engagements.</p>
<p>Book launched the south Florida-based group because her female nanny sexually abused her for years and she wants to prevent sexual abuse through education and awareness. The politician also wants to help survivors heal with guidance and support.</p>
<p>It’s not just a labor of love for the Florida legislator, who got elected in 2016. As chief executive officer of her charity Book receives a generous $135,000 annual salary, according to a nonprofit investigative journalism conglomerate that broke the story about this outrageous conflict of interest. Since 2012 <em>Lauren’s Kids</em> has received north of $10 million in taxpayer money because the senator’s father, Ron Book, is a prominent lobbyist who happens to be the group’s chairman. In just a few years Lauren’s Kids has “become one of the Florida Legislature’s most favored private charities,” the news article states. Governor Rick Scott, who is in his second term, went along with the $1.5 million appropriations for Book’s charity when he signed Florida’s $83 billion budget recently.</p>
<p>As if this weren’t enraging enough, Lauren’s Kids used a chunk of the taxpayer funds it has received to pay a Tallahassee public relations firm millions of dollars, accounting for 28% of its expenses. A follow-up story by the same investigative journalism outlet reveals that the senator’s charity paid Sachs Media Group $3.1 million between 2012 and 2015 as well as a yet-to-be-disclosed amount in 2016. “Millions of taxpayer dollars flowed through the nonprofit to Sachs Media as it both promoted Lauren’s Kids and cultivated Sen. Book’s public persona as a survivor of child sex abuse,” the article states.</p>
<p>A quick look at Lauren Book’s website shows that she’s your typical DemocRAT politician as she proudly displays a picture of her standing next to Hillary Clinton. I wonder where she learned her habit of funneling money to herself in the name of ‘charity’?</p>

            I said this a long time ago, that Laurens kids were PG related. There is a pizza slice with two butterflies flying out, and I have to sit there and stare at them at the stoplight knowing what it means. We have more vanity plates than anywhere on the planet I would imagine.Taxes at work.

            Yeah, I got a weird vibe about this case a couple of days ago. At first, I was overjoyed, but then this feeling of futility hit and I would bet anyone this ain't going anywhere. Those hypes about people talking, etc., just wishful thinking.

              Hey, I'm keeping it real. What was it a month ago ... two months ... Q said to be prepared. For what? Nothing's happened! And there's more mass migrations and the harpys are still yapping and now we have Mrs. Smollett walking back her story with no ramifications for lying. Really false hopes are just that. Remember all the hope surrounding Weinstein and NXiVM?
             </p>
             <p>
              But I do understand. You're trying to keep positive and there I am putting the opposite out there. I've lost hope. I really have.

            McCawley can also be McCualey, or McCauly(4). Jewish from Ireland I suppose. I know one of the four for instance. Art school connection in my home town is Ringling Art School. That is the focus of the investigation here in my hometown, which defends your hometown. I live in extreme elite town. Garbofantasticallistic decor.

            CITIZENS OF ALL NATIONS: We stand together united against a common peril. Planet Earth and her lifeforms are under assault. No, this is not an alien attack from another world. This is an attack by alien creatures that have risen among us, monsters whose unbridled ignorance, arrogance, greed, and thirst for power have no limits. Worse, the monsters have absolutely no concern for the well-being of humanity, not even for their own families.
           </p>
           <p>
            UNIVERSITY SCIENTISTS should tell the truth. Instead, they deceive the public by talking about geoengineering as if it is some future possibility. Are their heads buried in the sand? Do they not see what is happening in the air above them? Do they not question? Have they no concerns even for their own families?
           </p>
           <p>
            ARTIFICIAL CLOUDS, sprayed by tanker-jets, have been reported with ever increasing frequency for at least fifteen years. Since about 2013, it has ramped-up to full operational level over America and elsewhere on the globe. But what are they spraying? No answers from authorities. Just silence or lies. Why the secrecy? Why? Because there is strong evidence that the main substance they are spraying is coal fly ash, a toxic-nightmare that can be inhaled or enter through skin and eyes. Our bodies’ moisture is all that is required to release a host of toxins in chemically mobile forms, including aluminum, implicated in neurological diseases. The monsters are poisoning humanity.
           </p>
           <p>
            TO MEMBERS OF NATIONAL SCIENCE ACADEMIES, I say this: Tell the truth about what has been happening in the air above us, warn people of the dangers, the risks to health, admit that knowledgeable scientists have too little understanding of the Earth’s complex behavior to even consider geoengineering.
           </p>
           <p>
            TO POLITICIANS I say this: Serve the interests of the people who elected you. Stop this geoengineering insanity.
           </p>
           <p>
            TO THE INTERNATIONAL CRIMINAL COURT I say this: If you haven’t done so already, initiate an investigation into the crimes against humanity perpetrated under the guise of geoengineering.
           </p>
           <p>
            AND TO ALL THOSE WHO STRUGGLE to bring an end to this inhumane activity: I salute you. And I thank you.
           </p>
