First, Twitter squashed #PizzaGate from being able to trend on the site, possibly to stop people from learning about it. It was then learned that some people were either completely banned, suspended, or shadow banned for using the hashtag or discussing it. Then, a Twitter user uncovered and exposed thousands of other Twitter users who are/were actively engaging in the dissemination of child pornography. That user was banned, but the offending accounts were not. The next day, <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/pizzagate">/r/pizzagate</a> was removed along with all other subreddits dealing with the investigation. As some have pointed out there are still active subreddits whose members are self proclaimed pedophiles, and the subreddit is a place where they can come together. Those subreddits were not removed. Also, over the past few years, media outlets such as Salon, the NYT, and even the DailyMail have run articles about pedophilia, where it is painted in a sympathetic light, instead of a negative one (links provided below). Alt the height of the transgender bathroom debate, many pedophile rights organizations likened the struggles of transgendered people, to those of pedophiles. As we learned from Yuri Bezmenov, the ideas of  &quot;social justice&quot; were intentionally implanted into American minds to allow American citizens to eventually accept Communism as an acceptable form of Government, instead of an enemy. I personally believe this is currently happening again, but this time it is the normalization of pedophilia. We have also seen a great deal of political influence coming from Arabic nations, where child brides are very common, and child sex abuse is rampant. An effort is being made to actively suppress the internet from exposing an international child sex trafficking ring, because it is still unacceptable to society. So, right now it needs to be censored, or dismissed as &quot;fake news&quot;. It is my belief that the introduction of Arabic migrants, who would bring their child sex abuse along with them as part of their &quot;culture&quot;, as well as Liberal news outlets reporting sympathetically on pedophilia, is an attempt to normalize it to the American population. Which is why there is such a big effort to import as many Arab migrants as possible by the current administration, with careless disregard to possible terrorist ties. The potential election of Donald Trump would have stopped this, so it needed to be squashed, and it needed to be squashed fast. That could explain some of the continued hostility from the MSM directed at President Elect Trump. With that said, I think we need to focus on people who are in high positions of power within the MSM, and see what connections we can make between them and the known individuals of PizzaGate. My guess is that there will be more links than we know of now.</p>

            Wtf you talking about? I think you misunderstood my post, because we are on the same side here great_regret.
           </p>
           <p>
            If it was up to me, paedophiles who act upon their urges would be locked up for life, without the possibility of parole. I'm cool with the death penalty in many cases as well.
           </p>
           <p>
            It's also not wrong to say that paedophiles who seek help or control themselves so they don't hurts kids deserve respect. Better they seek help, then the alternative. I think you misunderstood my post.
           </p>
           <p>
            Save your venom for the paedophiles and their apologists --- which is not me.

             I saw your response and immediately got angry that anyone would think I would be okay with hurting kids.

             This is why I'm here --- I want to help expose this any way I can.  But yeah, I did just come from Reddit :) and am Canadian, so perhaps I need to work on making my point with less sugar coating.

            Finally someone who see where the problem really is. Also, if not all homosexuals are pedophiles, its obvious that homosexuality is prevalent in pedophile rings.
           </p>
           <p>
            Neither Pedophilia or Homosexuality should be normalized. They are not "diseases". All pedophile must suffer death penalty, wether they "act on it" or not.

            For a start they need to suck that shit up and stop trying to form support and "pride" groups.
           </p>
           <p>
            I mean, you don't see me dragging pedophiles into the street and skinning them alive, and that's something I totally get off on bro. Like, I have this terrible struggle inside myself where I just really really want to peel the skin off lying, conniving, sleazy, snakey, slimey, cunty, shitfuck pedos who are trying to portray themselves as "victims" or "tragic heroes". Some days it's almost uncontrollable!
           </p>
           <p>
            So what about my struggle? Should I start a "Pedo-Skinner" pride movement? I totally promise we'll never actually skin any pedos, but I and other "PS"ers will talk about it constantly in chat rooms, share images of actual pedo-skinning, tell each other about our terrible fantasies of skinning pedos.
            <em>
             Totally
            </em>
            not psyching each other up into a skinning frenzy and reinforcing our paraphilic fetish as a normal aspect of the human condition among ourselves or attempting to normalize our horrific desires within mainstream society.
           </p>
           <p>
            Come on, think of we poor Pedo-Skinners. We're people too!

            Perhaps some of what you said is true but I don't think the higher ups would want to normalize due to leverage. I think it's more about creating chaos and division amongst us with the immigrations.

            but be careful not to broad brush paint an entire culture from other places.  Just like us here - we clearly have a pedophilia culture while many of us go around unaware of it.  The broad brush strokes suggesting muslim bans pisses a lot of people off because there are still good people from countries that commit atrocities.  See the USA for instance.

             I agree that a broad brush should not be used. With that said, the majority of Muslim refugees are coming from more underdeveloped parts of the World. In these parts, religion tends to be strictly adhered to. Also, these refugees are bring their strict religious beliefs with them, see what is happening in Europe. I'm not saying that all of the Muslim refugees to this, but again, it some obviously do, and being that it is their "culture" it could be used as a toll to normalize this behavior.

            i apologize if i am being intolerant, but paedophilia is something that must never be normalized. I can't accept a world where rich, sick pieces of sh-t can f-k little kids with impunity. That these calcified old relics thought we'd tolerate this is absurd. Our culture may be depraved, but we're not that far gone.
           </p>
           <p>
            I will say though, with sincerity that paedophiles who are able to control their compulsions or who seek help --- deserve a ton of respect. But adults who acts upon these urges should be very scared, because unlike their victims, they have a choice and they're choosing to harm the most innocent/vulnerable in society. There is nothing normal about f-king little kids.

             As a social worker with a Masters degree and specialism in mental health issues, one of my first jobs was working in the Justice system in the UK, in a probation Hostels. Our primary client group was sex offenders of which paedophiles were the largest group. I was tasked with counselling and arranged by services, support groups and monolitoring to help such people "contribute to society". The thinking being that we needed to cure them by working with them and that long custodial sentences didn't work.
            </p>
            <p>
             I went into this with all the theory. All the studies and "approved knowledge". But reality proved it is bull. These people have the HIGHEST rate of recidivism (chance of reoffending) of all criminal types. I was so disgusted at the huge amount of work and effort invested, and many all along we're going through the motions, or secretly meeting other paedophiles, or scouting out new targets. Or in many cases, actively abusing kids whilst under my legally mandated supervision.
            </p>
            <p>
             I quite and ended up working with children in care. Then you get to see the other side and the extreme damage caused - not just to the abused, but their entire family, and many victims go on to seek out being abused (terribly hard to understand), or worse becoming abusers themselves.
            </p>
            <p>
             Paedophilia is a corrosive sore on mankind. It's the manifestation of evil. No normalisation or excuses or moralising or pseudo-psychological theorising can EVER justify it. Long custodial sentences must be imposed and lifelong monitoring is essential given the extreme chance of reoffending. Yes I think it's a mental sickness but so is serial killing, and we would never consider mitigating THAT by turning the killer into a victim and enabling him through social acceptance or offering excuses for him to lean on.
            </p>
            <p>
             No mercy for paedophilia. It is a cancer destroying society and is mushrooming because Western society has reached a moral crisis point.
            </p>
            <p>
             Sorry for the rant I had to get it off my chest, not the best expressed as I am on my phone. Keep up the good work. No mercy for the Pedo Elites

            This is my take on your accusation of "normalizing" it. Pedophilia needs the same kind of reform as illegal substances. People going through the mental disorder need to seek help but they can't because they are afraid of being called a sick pervert.
           </p>
           <p>
            The current laws do make it hard for someone who has an attraction to kids to get help because imagine if anyone went up to you, they never looked at child porn, or touched a kid in a harmful way but they confided and said "I'm attracted to kids." you would be disgusted by it wouldn't you? On top of that, if one admits to their mental disorder they assume the worse, they would assume they look at child porn, assume they have porn on their computer and assume they have molested before. In the same way if someone has a heroin addiction, they would fear going to the police or any authority for help because they don't want to go to prison and have it on their record so rather than get help they let it eat away inside til they either die from an overdose or in the other instance molest a child.
           </p>
           <p>
            Of course for everyone situation there are two sides to every coin. There are Pedophiles who can live perfectly normal lives never hurting children, subsiding their urges and desperately wanting to get the help they can't get because of the  mark it would live on them for the rest of their lives. Then there are sick sociopaths who just love the idea of control. We can't treat people the way we're being treated in the sense of being lumped as a single group, when we are all individuals, some who want to fight the cause of pizzagate and others whom just want to cause chaos.
           </p>
           <p>
            Yes, as disturbing as it is to think that out there, there are adults who wish to be intimate with children, you have to remember, not all pedophiles are child molestors, and honestly, not all child molestors are pedophiles, some people are just sick fucks that hurt just because they want to be in control. This is just a disclaimer that you can't demonize a whole group of people just because of what some do, you have to take a step back and remind yourself, addiction, depression, sexual attraction, they are all mental dysfunctions within the brain that cause you to desire certain things, that you can't help but want ti, to need it, to lust for it.
           </p>
           <p>
            People who molest, and never attempted to try to get help, yes they should be punished but they should also be given the chance to rehabilitate because you can't always blame the person that grew up for turning into the person they turned into, you also have to look into their past. But you always have to remember, there are definitely people out there right now who know what they feel is wrong but they are afraid to get help, because they know the moment they admit it to someone, that person will never look at them the same way again.

             I completely agree with your argument that many of these people cannot help it. What I was proposing in my post wasn't that there is a movement to allow pedophiles to come forward publicly to seek help, but an attempt to rationalize pedophilia. If it becomes rationalized slowly, then the pedophiles won't need any rehabilitation, barbecue it will no longer be considered a mental health issue. Much like with transgendered people. They make up approx .02% of the US population, but they need special laws and rules catered to them, and any who oppose those changes are labeled bigots. Many psychologists agree that people who identify as transgender merely suffer from a mental disorder that needs to be treated medically, and not coddled. I'm proposing the idea that the MSM and liberal politicians are trying to change pedophilia from a mental disorder to being another protected class of individual, just like transgendered people.  Because, once it is no longer considered a mental health disorder, they can lobby to change laws against pedophilia because those laws would be discriminatory.

             There is a difference between a child molester and a pedophile.  We are on a search for serial pedophiles, particularly violent pedophiles and those who are involved in child trafficking.

             True pedophilia is not a disease. It cannot be treated with medication or therapy. It is a brain abnormality which circumvents a biological process to allow for sexual attraction to a prepubescent partner.

             Serial pedophiles in prison have reported that their obsession cannot be stopped, no matter the consequences, they will offend again.  The addition of violence is akin to a serial killer.

             What you just said is exactly what those "normalization" articles say. That is exactly the kind of thing they said about gays back when the first started trying to normalize them.

              That is exactly my point, and a great comparison. Now, homosexuals are a protected class of citizen. Laws that were established to prevent homosexuality, such as anti sodomy laws, have been repealed on the basis that they are discriminatory. Even the Pope has begun changing the Catholic Church's view on homosexuals. That is what I fear they are trying to do with pedophilia by normalizing it, making them a protected class who can fight laws based on discrimination.

             This is quite a brilliant post.  Pedophilia should not be normalized, but rather treated as a mental illness similar to depression, where there exists no more social taboo to make these people afraid to seek help for their affliction for fear of being labeled a monster.  We need to help these people, not ostracize them from the general populace because they suffer from an affliction which is beyond their control.

              I agree. But, I think what the MSM and liberal politicians are trying to do is expose the American public to it enough until they can label pedophiles as a protected class of people. If pedophiles become a protected class, laws and regulations can be changed or repealed based on the grounds that they are discriminatory. Which would be unacceptable.

            Basically similar to how terrorists don't see themselves as evil. Except we are labeled the terrorists and we are demonized as a result.
