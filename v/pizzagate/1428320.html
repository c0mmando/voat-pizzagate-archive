            I knew of Voat since its early stages but I never really wanted to migrate. All of my subscriptions and saved shit from Liberal Land kept me from making the move until now. The banning of pizzagate put me way over the edge. Thank you for these resources.

             My pleasure.
            </p>
            <p>
             I too came in the early inception period, but didn't create an account until a couple of weeks ago.
            </p>
            <p>
             I've been on
             <a href="#s" title="Reddit">
             </a>
             for about 8 years total, 5 years with my last account. It's kind of sad watching my comment history get wiped one by one, but then again
             <a href="#s" title="Reddit">
             </a>
             died a long time ago and I was just holding on for some reason.
            </p>
            <p>
             Glad to help.
