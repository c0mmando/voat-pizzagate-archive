<p>While that might not be necessarily be illegal considering the Wiki is public domain, graphics provided by a close friend and a leading contributor to Pizzagate Wiki were expressly given copyright unto their creator, as can be found by the ridiculous Copyright page I actually bothered to fill out myself well over a month ago. See: <a href="http://pizzagate.wiki/The_Pizzagate_Wiki:Copyrights">http://pizzagate.wiki/The_Pizzagate_Wiki:Copyrights</a></p>
<p>And I quote: &quot;Content provided on The #Pizzagate Wiki is public domain, except for various site-specific logos and graphics, which remain under the copyright of their respective creators.&quot;</p>
<p>Now I present to you the artfully, brilliantly crafted Pizzagate Wiki banners and works made for us by beloved contributor, Sliceoflife: <a href="http://pizzagate.wiki/images/8/8a/Banner-pizzagate-wiki.png">http://pizzagate.wiki/images/8/8a/Banner-pizzagate-wiki.png</a></p>
<p>As well as their series of &quot;Pamphlets&quot; which will soon look very familiar: <a href="http://pizzagate.wiki/Activism#Pamphlets">http://pizzagate.wiki/Activism#Pamphlets</a></p>
<p>In contrast here are a set of &quot;posters&quot; which are offered on Pizzagate.com as being original (albeit very crudely manipulated): <a href="http://pizzagate.com/posters/">http://pizzagate.com/posters/</a> <a href="https://archive.is/JXz1c">https://archive.is/JXz1c</a></p>
<p>The Wiki\'s freely available information is frequently quoted and prominently displayed, for example here: <a href="https://archive.is/Tfrk8#selection-1363.0-1449.30">https://archive.is/Tfrk8#selection-1363.0-1449.30</a> and here: <a href="https://archive.is/Tfrk8#selection-1363.0-1449.30">https://archive.is/Tfrk8#selection-1363.0-1449.30</a> </p>
<p>There is also no argument that a bulk, if not almost all the Instagram images and the like belong to their respective owners as well, even if we dislike them personally. Also, that research was absolutely and completely taken (often word for word) from early researchers on 4chan, 8ch, Reddit, etc. who are not given even the slightest mention. Their research remains publicly available for free, and pizzagate.com does not in any way expound upon this research in a new way or represent it to the reader in a different medium that hasn\'t already been done freely (ie. <a href="https://citizeninvestigators.org">https://citizeninvestigators.org</a>, <a href="https://our.wikileaks.org">https://our.wikileaks.org</a>, and of course, <a href="http://pizzagate.wiki">http://pizzagate.wiki)</a>)</p>
<p>The owners of this site have repeatedly asked for sums from $2,500 to $12,500 in order to &quot;recover the cost&quot; of the website, and it is currently available on Flippa.com for a minimum bid of $12,500: <a href="https://flippa.com/7906106-pizzagate-com">https://flippa.com/7906106-pizzagate-com</a> (For the record, you scummy fucks: <a href="https://archive.is/FCGHH">https://archive.is/FCGHH)</a>)</p>
<p>As for the claim of recovering the cost, I personally (coincidentally enough) tried to purchase pizzagate.com myself just before settling on pizzagate.wiki</p>
<p>I didn\'t make this decision because pizzagate.com was thousands of dollars, but rather more like a difference between $30 and $50, plus to me Wiki just made more sense for a Wiki. This was via GoDaddy, and in absolutely no way would the price of a domain spike in such a manner unless the creators of pizzagate.com were scammed.</p>
<p>For this reason I claim not only does pizzagate.com commit unethical and possibly civilly-liable behavior for attempting to profit from this material, but in some cases (ie. the posters) may actually infringe upon the copyrights of others in the name of said profit.</p>
<p><strong>Here\'s to every serious researcher who has conducted their work without need for self-gain and most importantly fortune, and do their work intrepidly and without regard for profits.</strong></p>

            What needs be done is expose them for being every bit as evil and disgusting as the pedos themselves and do everything possible to completely block them from voat. And of course go full lulz on them. What's your name? Who's your momma? What's your number? Where do you bank? Who's your landlord? Join any clubs? Back to ya momma, she got a sister?

            ) stated that he had to buy the domainname for what i can remember something like $1.250,-. Like i said, if he can deliver proof of that and want to keep the domain in our comunity, things can be done i think.
           </p>
           <p>
            For some it sounds silly that this domain was already taken and if sold that it would be sold for this amount. But to be fair, i think it is not strange. When domain trade is one of your side business the "gate" name can be profitable. For example, what if there came out a scandal from domino pizzas that was given the # #PizzaGate It can be for a business like that with that amount of advertising budget a cheap "protection" to buy that domain before it is getting a company scandal page.

            are the current auctions of domain names that were registered but are not extended. Before they come on free market, interests have a opportunity to get it before it gets on open market. I have bought by this way a domain that i wanted/needed for years. There where already bids on it, so i had to bid because it would not get on free market. I gladly won the bid.
           </p>
           <p>
            But look at the sometimes strangest names people have registered in the past

            , and possibly more are all accounts just a few hours old, registered exclusively to comment aggressively on this topic, and they seem to all be heavily pushing the agenda of a lawsuit against pizzagateDOTcom. This is most accounts in this comment thread. See my
            <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/v/pizzagate/1592743/7786240">
             observations of downwithcomet
            </a>
            . I'm suspecting that this is both to discourage sharing the results of investigation on the web in the future, and to hijack the focus and resources of the community and make us invest in a lawsuit that has nothing to do with the original investigation, potentially providing grounds for the media to smear us for it.

                Brigading happens, although I have to say I haven't personally seen this level of it before. I've banned 28 users, they literally took over the narrative on this submission and

               <p>
                I think this was a strong post that was not pushing for action regarding the main investigation but rather a member of the community, and it was a fertile ground for

                 Had to also throw in my personal opinion on suing pizzagateDOTcom: Brigading on all sides is attempting to schism the Voat Pizzagate community. Mysterious flood of users demands and later claims I am running a class-action lawsuit against pizzagateDOTcom, which I couldn't give a flying fuck about doing because I have no grounds to sue them nor would I care to. This thread was simply meant to point out the web of lies orchestrated by pizzagateDOTcom, how it takes advantage of the community, how strange the profits really are, and how those who have legitimate claims to their copyrights being infringed upon now have more grounds to take action and important material archived.

             Voat mods have pointed out that content from Voat is not exactly fair use without express permission (which you can imagine complicates making money from such a site in which you claim the information as your own).

             Also, as I mentioned, there are graphics and certain images which are covered by the copyrights of their perspective creators (without mention, credit, or compensation). Plagiarism may also play a factor here in some cases as well.

              So why isnt there a page that gives this express permission to all users? Not that it matters because if I want to use any of the archived information I have from voat I would use it anyway under fair act pretty certain that any suit brought against me would be won by me. I am sure they would like the truth out right? Also I would never try to profit from vaot. Even if I lost, the time the information is out there is more important.

               I think Voat is generally quite understanding on this subject, but in this particular case we also have deliberate misleading of the community to literally profit a potentially enormous sum. For that reason Voat mods also took a stand against use of Voat information with that URL in particular.

            It goes without saying many aspects of this undermine the greater community. Not very much is known about the owners of pizzagateDOTcom despite repeated contact for a few weeks, and yet almost all of the Pizzagate research sites have gotten to the point where the admins are coming together to collaborate, and yet pizzagate(dot)com are strangely absent themselves. Conveniently they are trying to make a buck off it all, though, and that could really damage us all.

            They honestly do what they can with this pretty monumental task, so don't be afraid to speak up to one of them sometime if you think something's awry. Don't be a jerk, but don't be silent either.

            To be perfectly honest I'm not exactly concerned about any direct action until the site itself sells.

            could also just as easily learn from the public outrage and might even be a valuable ally to the cause if "they" could channel this energy into some meaningful contributions to the community.
           </p>
           <p>
            I'll say it now that I personally don't care for money, so as much as I'd like to entertain the legalities with you at this moment public shame seems to be doing the job just fine.
           </p>
           <p>
            Nothing criminal or severe has been done to warrant legal action until it is proven whether or not the domain has actually been used to generate revenue (which it claims does not), but has also not yet been disproven by pizzagateDOTcom personally either.

            I already run my own site, so I don't try to encroach. I do offer my support though, and have reached out to them whenever something major has happened (the Wiki getting DDoS'd, the removal of the post about it, etc.) and have always been able to get in touch with at least some of them in those cases.

            This little thread just blew my mind. Thanks for the support! Accolades don't mean squat to simply having a great community to reach out to.

            I'll be discussing new breakthroughs on The Higherside Chats podcast in about a week, by the by. Honestly, I just want folks to start standing up for themselves and recognize abuse in all its forms so they can also help each other.
           </p>
           <p>
            Keep it real, Pizzagators! And may the Kek be with us!

            I will repeat that original works are something else entirely. On top of that the claimed cost of $12,500 would make sense. Neither in this case are true, and to sell another's work as your own for gross profits is the main concern here. This was more or less an attempt to extort the Pizzagate community for cash.

            Atleast the right information is on the website and is it not a debunk website or a empty one. And for google ranking that including the domainname is a plus for the information we try to spread atm imo.
           </p>
           <p>
            I think it would be far more helpfull for the anti-pizzagate shills to use that domainname as a debunk website and using it to inform people (with the right) information makes no sense to me as a shill website.
           </p>
           <p>
            I do agree that this "suspicion"
            <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/user/pizzagateDOTcom">
             @pizzagateDOTcom
            </a>
            has brought on to himself and only he is to blame for that. If he spend money to purchase the domain and would stop working on it, he could just have done it here. Including the proof of the $ he spend to buy the domain. And if that was lets say $ 2.000,-. i think we as comunity would have raised that money within a day to release the person from the website/stress and keep it as a tool for the community.
           </p>
           <p>
            to conclude, i do not send people to that website (do to the auction, did before that), but as long the right info is on it and keeps being updated i also do not classify it as a shill website.
           </p>
           <p>
            I hope
            <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/user/pizzagateDOTcom">
             @pizzagateDOTcom
            </a>
            will provide the proof of his expenses and we as community can and will take it over as a tool. I for one are for sure willing to contribute $2,- to $5,- for that. But
            <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/user/pizzagateDOTcom">
             @pizzagateDOTcom
            </a>
            has to show solid proof of his expenses first so profit can be ruled out imo.

            Just like Comet Ping Pong's GoFundMe campaign. Money wasn't really the goal, if you get what I mean.

            People put a lot of time into their work and to have some jackass copy and paste all their work to make a DIME off this investigation is taking advantage the situation. It's just a scumbag type of move.

            " The goal was to spread pizzagate and now it's trending hard. isn't that what you wanted? "

             The goal is to spread awareness not to be a snake and sell it for 10k more than you paid for especially since you plagiarized researchers work.

            <strong>
             I would sell it back for what you paid for it. The goal was to spread awareness. Also, you're  putting the jeopardy of giving it to someone with a bad motive by auctioning it. Just like the shooter at CPP we don't control his actions so you using the death threat excuse is absolutely ridiculous.  You're trying to say if the death threats from whoever is allegedly sending them (we have no proof) don't stop then I will sell the website that has been plagiarized  for 10k dollars higher?  What kind of logic is that? Just know people don't forget and lost respect for you.

            It's not exactly my job to protect you from getting sued and what YOU did, but maybe start by asking the individuals in this thread: Millenial_Falcon for one, and Sliceoflife himself if you would actually lift a finger.

            Maybe you should think about these things before you sell them.

            No, those would be original works. You selling a t-shirt designed by someone else as your own, however, is wrong.

            This is just how copyright law works. We all hate it, but it stops works from being misused without the author's consent.

            Because my mission is to help the community. Some may be hurt by this and deserve to know. I said I have no issue with use of Wiki public domain content, but when you try to make money from OTHERS' works you run into trouble (hence why I opted not to solicit donations even on our site). If you had or ARE selling the site others would be entitled to credit, compensation, or redaction of their material.

              I don't feel it exactly pertinent to list them out, and most are here in this thread already, but at least 5 individuals claim already their works were copied and displayed on this site.

             <p>
              This slides the main point, however, as to why they claim the need for this sum of money for freely available research.

               so you want them compensated if he makes a sale, right?  Or simply not use their particular work, but source other work from the pizzagate universe, of which there is of course quite a bit.  Or are they fine with getting credited?  Just trying to have you spell it out because it is not really clear what the kicke scum and hatred and piss coments are exactly all about.  thx.

                I'll agree I have no idea where the hate came from and it's ridiculous.

               <p>
                I just think the secretive nature of the sale and the fact that copyrighted works were included as if they belonged to pizzagate.com is wrong and could even get pizzagate.com in civil court trouble, especially now that they're documented and archived. I simply go where the facts take me.

                  Honestly thank you for being skeptical. I supported the effort until I recognized something legitimately wrong that might derail the whole Pizzagate investigation by making us look irresponsible and reckless.

                   glad to have helped.  He seemed pretty cooperative by the end, after the pitchforks were lowered a bit.  So I guess the ball is in your court to serve a PM at him explaining exactly what you want removed, credited or compensation for etc.

                    Mostly I hope it's a lesson learned and now they know the community is watching, considering pizzagate.com extorted them for money more-or-less.

                      I'll PM them more, but I honestly have since the site went for sale. I have every intention of helping my fellows out, but I can't let folks get taken advantage of either.

                      On that note it's also not my job to request other people's material be removed. Legally pizzagateDOTcom should have done that themselves before trying to sell, and I can't afford to waste my life covering their mistake.

            Thanks again,  and I appreciate your cooperation. That still doesn't explain how you arrived at your dollar figures, though. Those were pretty steep, and at the time of sale you certainly evaded any cooperation with the larger community, which I can't explain either.

            Your dodging the question, you claim the proceeds of the sale are only to cover costs but cant account for $12,500 in expenses, your dealing with an educated audience here.

             You are dodging the main point, which is that you have the site up for auction, with a $12,500 starting bid, no less
            </strong>
            .  This completely contradicts your previous narrative that you were only trying to recover costs (the alleged $2500 you spent for the domain, a claim for which you never provided evidence, which should be available in the form of some kind of receipt).  And you call US suspicious?

            I believe I have specified the images in question in the post, and in particular the posters you list.
           </p>
           <p>
            I figured it pertinent to the community to know that their contributions as well might be part of any possible sale, as well as social media information which you do not own.
           </p>
           <p>
            I simply object to the principle of making money off of Pizzagate, and the community seems to as well. Could you at least better justify the pricing and how your expenses influenced this?
           </p>
           <p>
            Thanks for replying, but I believe there are several members of the community at large deserving of answers.

            A good portion of the value (if it does sell) should be attributed to the domain.  In fact the fact that it is non-original content available on open sites, that are crawlable, and predate the copy means that the content is essentially useless.  I doubt anyone will pay that much on flippa.
           </p>
           <p>
            One reason alternate reason to post on flippa is essentially to pay $17 for a site valuation.  Set the minimum high and let people bid.  The site is a little strange in that the poster can't see the bids.. but bidders can so you just create two accounts to see what people bid.
           </p>
           <p>
            Sellers often drop the price when buyers bid less so buyers won't be put off by the excessive reserve and they will get the information they want.

            I'm not surprised.  Anytime there is money to be made, the hucksters will come.  It doesn't sound like the case, but a lot of registrars run algorithms which detect search terms and rapidly escalate the price of domains for the hot ones.

             I live near him, I communicate w/ him, as do other trusted people here. He's not interested nor does he have the time nor mental fortitude to mess w/ the website, the guy was really shaken. I hope people here don't start accusing him, he's offered enough proof.

              Yeah Ryan made a video saying look man I am stepping down, and moving on... he wants to distance himself from the investigation because of the threats made against him, and honestly I don't blame him.

              and the owner of the website in question is pizzagateDOTcom, voat name joisaperv or something similar.  I read his argument and he said the site got traffic (but is that confirmed?) and the information was supposed to be shared by all, so awareness is spread, why everyone mad, bro, basically.  That was when he was being questioned about putting it up for sale for $2500 because he got death threats, according to him.

              you are correct - I looked back at this and Ryan has nothing to do with it.  PizzagateDOTcom is not Ryan.

              ah.  well it is in the interests of clearing that up that he should be PM'd, pinged I suppose.  Having observed what went down with him, I wouldn't suspect him - he doesn't think in terms of making 10k plus dollars.  His only monetization was less than $100 over a few T-shirts, which he caught SelfRighteousHell for.  He refunded the few bucks he 'made' on the shirts.  That's not the MO for turning around and trying to make over t0k on pizzagate in the next breath.
             </p>
             <p>
              He said he was getting out of the game and I believe him.  But it would be nice to have his confirmation.

            Seems like a genuine enough and decent guy. You can listen to an interview with him on the Higherside Chats, and if anything he is a bit alarming, but I feel he is honest and stands to lose more by supporting pizzagate than he would have gained by toeing the line.

            upvoated this lonely post because I think it smells really fishy... I noticed the site had many, many broken links about a few weeks ago, but I didnt think anything of it.

            , and possibly more are all accounts just a few hours old, registered exclusively to comment aggressively on this topic, and they seem to all be heavily pushing the agenda of a lawsuit against pizzagateDOTcom. This is most accounts in this comment thread. See my
            <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/v/pizzagate/1592743/7786240">
             observations of downwithcomet
            </a>
            . I'm suspecting that this is both to discourage sharing the results of investigation on the web in the future, and to hijack the focus and resources of the community and make us invest in a lawsuit that has nothing to do with the original investigation, potentially providing grounds for the media to smear us for it.

             When I link people to pizzagate I sure don't link them to that dot com site, I link to the executive summary thread on here and it's my opinion that thats what we all should be doing. I don't trust that site, and even if it's good info there, this is where people should be pointed in my opinion, or maybe find a good video and show them that...

           </p>
           <p>
            Edit:  Also, whereas he previously claimed he was motivated by death threats, the fact that he's selling the site to the highest bidder, with a minimum bid of $12,500, proves that his motive is money.  Who has that kind of money to dish out for a website?  Well, James Alefantis, John Podesta, and Hillary Clinton, for starters.

             he stole stuff from my blog too.  I had a picture of our good friend John Podesta that I surrounded with a red border.  It was on pizzagate.com within minutes.  I'll join you guys in any class action lawsuit.

             12,500? That's ridiculous, I can buy two servers the domain name and everything for that, but really you can host a site on a web server that you rent for very cheap. A year for under 100 dollars... so why is this guy asking for so much? What a dick.
