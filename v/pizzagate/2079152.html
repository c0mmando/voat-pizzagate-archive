            "Last week, the force announced its investigation - Operation Conifer - was drawing to a close, with a report expected to be published in the autumn. Since then, however, the force has said the findings will be passed to the Independent Inquiry into Child Sexual Abuse (IICSA), chaired by Professor Alex Jay"
           </p>
           <p>
            This will not bring it to light either.  The Inquiry is being suppressed and stonewalled at every step.
            <br/>
            Theresa May et al are still actively covering up the full extent of "prominent person" paedophiles. This interview last week on Talk Radio from a member of the historical Child Abuse Inquiry panel. She states she was told what she could and could not say to a Parliamentary Select Committee and further, that this was intended to protect then Home Secretary May who they were predicting she was set to become PM as far back as TWO years ago:

              I was set to post this today.  I can't understand how the Chief of Wiltshire Police states one minute that he's "120%" convinced that the claims about Heath are true and in the next breath they're closing the investigation and handing it to the CSA Inquiry.  Mike Mansfield has stepped up with a willingness to chair this Inquiry and many have actively supported and campaigned for him, but they won't give it to him.  No prizes for guessing why.

            Cobbled together from various reports from Daily Mail, Mirror, Sun, Daily Star:
           </p>
           <p>
            The Wiltshire Chief Constable Mike Veale - the police chief investigating claims that Sir Edward Heath was a paedophile, is convinced the allegations are ‘120 per cent’ genuine. It goes beyond this, though - Heath was ‘linked to a murderous paedophile ring that killed 16 kids’.
           </p>
           <p>
            A group of victims allege the Tory PM abused them as children as part of a sex cult run by their own parents which burnt babies in satanic orgies. They allege the paedophile ring stabbed, tortured and maimed youngsters in churches before men, women and children gorged themselves on blood and body parts.
           </p>
           <p>
            One account about Heath: "Linda Corby said she watched 11 boys aged six to 11 from Jersey’s notorious Haut de la Garenne home board the former PM’s yacht in the island’s capital St Helier. A few hours later she counted only 10 as they left the Tory leader’s boat. Describing what she saw in the early 1970s, Linda, 62, said: “I was with Jersey senator Ralph Vibert who has since died.
           </p>
           <p>
            “He said he had been warned about children going on Heath’s yacht, Morning Cloud, and some not coming back. We watched as a group of boys from the home got on. They were in shorts and T-shirts and looked as if they were on a day trip.” Author Linda claimed she later went with the senator to Bouley Bay to watch the yacht return. She said: “We counted them back but one boy was missing.
           </p>
           <p>
            The mum from St Helier said she and the senator went to police HQ to make a statement but a few days later officers told them “someone above” had told them not to investigate.
           </p>
           <p>
            This is stuff that has been published in mainstream UK newspapers - a similar case in the U.S. would never see the light of day.
           </p>
           <p>
            Heath had been connected to Jimmy Savile, who procured children for him and the two have been photographed together since at least the early 70s - Jimmy Savile was connected to, you guessed it, the OTO.
