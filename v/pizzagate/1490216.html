<p>Over the road from Comet can be found a branch of Beyond Borders (<a href="https://www.google.co.uk/maps/dir/Beyond+Borders,+Connecticut+Avenue+Northwest,+Washington,+DC,+USA/Comet+Ping+Pong,+5037+Connecticut+Ave+NW,+Washington,+DC+20008,+USA/@38.9555805,-77.0723229,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m13!4m12!1m5!1m1!1s0x89b7c9b99a18e75b:0x7be0a92cb2e42bd!2m2!1d-77.0702474!2d38.955203!1m5!1m1!1s0x89b7c9b98f61ad27:0x81a8bf734dd1c58f!2m2!1d-77.0699666!2d38.9559497">see Google maps</a>), an organisation interested in the prevention of child trafficking (alongside numerous related causes). </p>
<p>According to Wikipedia (sorry) this is a name for the representative NGO of the ECPAT (End Child Prostitution, Child Pornography and Trafficking of Children for Sexual Purposes) and it\'s homepage <a href="http://www.beyondborders.org/en/home/">can be found on this link</a>. According to the contact us page, they can be found at Winnipeg, leading me to believe this is a Canadian branch of said organisation. The branch opposite Comet appears to be slightly different <a href="http://beyondborders.net/">and can be found at this link</a> with a .net domain, unlike the former which can be found at a .org. </p>
<p>Upon immediate inspection you will notice that the .org website (which you can find referenced on the ECPAT Wikipedia page) looks significantly more professional than the .net website. Next, <strong>you\'ll notice that the latter puts a particular emphasis on Hait</strong>i, including the statement <strong>&quot;Sign up for updates direct from Haiti&quot;</strong> at the top right hand side of the screen.</p>
<p>What I\'d be interested in knowing is how legitimate this branch of the ECPAT that is based over the road from Comet is and whether or not we can relate it directly to the wider <a href="http://www.ecpat.org/">http://www.ecpat.org/</a>. </p>
<p>I wont go over what we already know in any depth but for the sake of clarity; we know that <strong>Laura Silsby, operating in Haiti</strong>, attempted to traffick 33 children across the border to the Dominican Republic where she was apprehended. <a href="https://wikileaks.org/clinton-emails/emailid/2772">We know via WikiLeaks that Hillary Clinton was kept in the loop regarding the whereabouts of and circumstances regarding Laura Silby throughout the duration of her foreign incarceration</a>. Silsby had founded a &quot;refuge&quot; under the name New Life Children\'s Refuge (NLCR) that rented a hostel as an &quot;orphanage&quot;. I understand that this refuge was illegitimate however cannot find any reliable source demonstrating that to be case (if anybody can, that would be appreciated). <strong><a href="http://charlesortel.com/a-deep-dive-into-how-the-clinton-foundation-operates-illegally-and-in-haiti">Here is an article regarding the Clintons behaviours in Haiti which is linked in the XYZ article I\'ve cited above</a>.</strong></p>
<p><strong>If we cannot reliably tie the Washington D.C branch of Beyond Borders to the wider ECPAT, can we tie it to Laura Silsby/Silsby Gayler and the defunct NLCR? Can we confirm whether or not this or any branch of the ECPAT are funded by the Clintons? All I can find this far is the following link <a href="https://www.clintonfoundation.org/clinton-global-initiative/commitments/stop-sex-trafficking-children-and-young-people">https://www.clintonfoundation.org/clinton-global-initiative/commitments/stop-sex-trafficking-children-and-young-people</a></strong></p>
<p>Lastly, it’s worth noting that <strong>Norway cut it’s funding to the Clinton Foundation by roughly 90%</strong> after operation Dark Room <strong>snagged upwards of 50 high ranking Norwegian officials as pedophiles</strong> last month. <a href="http://www.hegnar.no/Nyheter/Politikk/2016/11/Norge-kutter-gigantoverfoeringer-til-Clinton-stiftelsen">Source</a> and <a href="http://www.thelocal.no/20161121/police-break-up-massive-norwegian-paedophilia-ring">source</a> </p>
<p>In summary: </p>
<p>1)	Is Washington “Beyond Borders” a branch of the ECPAT</p>
<p>2)	Are the ECPAT or Washington “Beyond Borders” funded by the Clintons</p>
<p>3)	Can the latter be related in any way to Laura Silsby </p>
<p>4)	<strong>Why is it difficult to believe that there is an NGO relating to the investigation of child trafficking and prostitution based over the road from Comet purely by chance.</strong></p>
<p>Whilst there is some circumstantial evidence indicative of the above (see the initial XYZ article linked at the beginning of my post), something tangible would in my opinion help to establish a more formidable stance for the claims of pizzagate.</p>',

            I just came across this post.  I've been concerned about the legitimacy of the Beyond Borders dot net organisation as well.  If you go down to the street view on Google maps to look for it all one sees at this address is a Sri Lankan restautant Banana Leaf.  Where exactly is Beyond Borders situated in that building ?

             Obama administration placed children with human traffickers
            </a>
            may be of relevance to this. See below quote from the article in question:
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             "The Obama administration failed to protect thousands of Central American children who have flooded across the U.S. border since 2011, leaving them vulnerable to traffickers and to abuses at the hands of government-approved caretakers, a Senate investigation has found."
            </p>
           </blockquote>
           <p>
            The article is focused on child trafficking for the purpose of labour, emphasizing young men taken from Guatemala, El Salvador, Honduras and so on. Perhaps this is totally unrelated but perhaps not. Keep in mind the Clinton Foundation's dodgy behaviour in Haiti,
            <strong>
             Laura Silsby (a "government-approved caretaker") being apprehended attempting to traffick 33 children across the border in to the Dominican Republic to a "shelter"
            </strong>
            and lastly, Beyond Borders situated opposite Comet Ping Pong. An unusual trail of coincidences if coincidence they are.

            I came across ECPAT a while ago. How big of an organization is this? If it's big enough, then it's not very strange, but if it's really small, then it's quite a coincidence.
           </p>
           <p>
            After I made this post about their sponsors being hotels, I changed my mind and thought it must be innocent. However, if there's anything fishy going on with ECPAT then it becomes suspicious again.

             The ECPAT itself appears to be quite large, with the representative NGO, Beyond Borders, being based seemingly in Canada however the branch that is opposite Comet Ping Pong is at a different URL and seems like a subsidiary branch or something suspect. It's quite hard to distinguish but as stated in my initial post it puts a heavy emphasis on Haiti which the wider organisation does not appear to. This strikes me as strange but may be nothing at all. Regarding the hotels, like you say it could be innocent but that does strike me as unusual. I'd not expect to see such a uniformity of sponsorship for an anti-child trafficking organisation, I'd expect to see a variety and I'd certainly not expect to see only hotels in particular. I'll look into this further and comment back with my thoughts once I've read your Polaris Project link.

             <blockquote>
              <p>
               Despite the number of victims, the hotel industry has been taking a stand. “We’ve made a lot of progress working with hotels in the United States. The travel industry has become really active because they know they can make a huge difference in the lives of victims,” says Michelle Guelbart, Director of Private Sector Engagement for ECPAT-USA. “With almost every training I lead, someone tells a story about how they have witnessed something on a hotel property. Our hope is that training to prevent and identify child sex trafficking becomes standard with the hospitality industry.”
              </p>
             </blockquote>
             <p>
              My impression is that the hotels seem to be working with the ECPAT to help minimise trafficking via a training scheme called
              <strong>
               "Does Your Hotel Know?"
              </strong>
              as described in the above link. This would explain the number of hotels funding the organisation.
             </p>
             <p>
              Nonetheless I feel like this is worthy of greater scrutiny and perhaps some emphasis on investigating major US hotels, especially the higher end establishments, would prove beneficial to pizzagate.

            Many of these NGO's and orphanges are fake certainly have very nefarious operations. There was an NGO called Books With No Borders in Cambodia (sounds like Books Without Borders) that was bogus and shut down. It was listed as limited partnership. Sadly it is unfortunately true that many NGO orphanages are used for trafficking. Are they all corrupt, no, but many are. Curious if anyone can explain this link and why, although it had initially opened in 2004 was shut down and then reopened in 2015 only to shut down again in 2016 .

             <a href="http://beyondborders.net/who-we-are/our-people-partners/">
              Beyond Borders [dot] net over the road from Comet Ping Pong
             </a>
             has a separate Board of Directors
             <a href="http://www.beyondborders.org/en/about/our-team/">
              to that of Beyond Borders [dot] org
             </a>
             and
             <a href="https://www.globalgiving.org/donate/10517/beyond-borders/reviews/">
              only one review on Global Giving
             </a>
             that doesn't look legitimate. They have not received much in donations for either one of their causes. None of this demonstrates that they're not quite what they claim and it would be unfair to say they're not without ample evidence but it definitely seems a little strange.

            Others have made the observation you have...thanks for reminding...but i have not seen a deep dig into it. It is worthwhile. There are so many trails to follow here, but it is good to chime in on this as I have not seen much related to it, and I had similar questions.
