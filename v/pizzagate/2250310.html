<p>I have a very close and reliable friendship who is a top Lieutenant in the English Army. He was based in Afghanistan and shared the same facilities with the US and top Afghan officials. I was going to write this post next week but the new voat post rushed me to it. I hope by now everybody here takes me seriously and that my source is honest to god true.</p>
<pre><code>What he told me is that there was a trench holes on the outside of the US base in Afghanistan were village people throw their kids in for the Afghan officials to come at night and rape them in exchange for FOOD. Yes, not even money, for two cereal bars you could have girls, kids, old beggars, whatever suits you best in that hole.
</code></pre>

<p>He also told me that after 10pm the US and English army were forbidden to go the shower area because it became a pedophilic scenario for the Afghan army. He told me that he made the mistake of going there on his first week and he saw pedo sado orgy with kids lined up against the wall, the showers running hot water and the whole floor was covered in blood. </p>
<p>He explained to me that Generals in the Afghan army show pride in having their own child slaves (the more blonde the most prized) and that these kids wouldnt last more than a couple months because they literally died from internal haemorrhages. He also verified what the article says that the US army and British army was instructed to accept that the Afghan army has a culturally heritage with pedophilia and that they should not interfere with their allies practices.</p>
<p>As you can imagine my friend, who is a regular small town guy, was very distressed about all these matters. </p>
<p>He explained to me that after Obama took office bombardments to civilian areas increased by 1500% and that only now they are in a peaceful transition (waiting eagerly for a new war to break up).</p>
<p>As mentioned many times before, Satanic Pedophilia is not only about personal pleasure. It is a world wide objective of THE CABAL. That is why it relates to pizzagate.</p>
<p>Blessings to all.</p>

            Our US Army actually court-martialed a soldier who tried to stop this boy raping bullshit. Our own military prosecuted a heroic American soldier who was so angry he beat the shit out of one of the rapists. That tells you everything you need to know about the Pentagon they don't want to stop this shit they approve of it.

            My god oh my god oh my God. Can this person make a statement? This corroborates with an article that just came out about the US government instructing US soldiers to turn a blind eye and not get involved with this because it was their culture. UGH

              Sorry, no links just memory from history classes.  Also have heard it in reference to the futility of trying to conquor Afganistan.  That even Alexander the Great couldn't do it.   His army ended there and was absorbed locally.  I don't mean to put all the blame on the Greeks.  Sexual Abuse of Children is not a single cultures problem.  What they did back in Ancient Greece wasn't MK type mental shattering of the infant.  This is a modern perversion.
             </p>
             <p>
              Their Suicide Bombers and our Mass Shooters are cut from the same cloth.  They are products of a shared technology.  Once you learn to split an atom or a mind, that becomes the way it is, It's next to impossible to put a powerful technology back in a box and close the lid.  You can hide it away and tell everybody just hush about this.   Like the CIA did in the Church Committee Hearings, 1977, ...."we stopped all that.".  Weather modification hasn't been openly mentioned by the government since about 1952.  I guess that promising new science just completely fizzled out.

              Are you sure there wasn't boy rape before Alexander the Great? Not saying we shouldn't not despise ancient Greek culture for their boy rape tradition.

              From what I've read, many people hold the view that the strict gender segregation in Afghanistan is one of the reasons this happens.

             Unfortunately, this is wrong. It goes back hundreds of years - the submission made by the OP three days ago explains this very well.

             But I think the wars in Afghanistan made the situation even worse.

              That is a very good plausible explanation. I also believe that this phenomena is mostly in afghanistan and nearbies. Do you have a link that corroborates your theory regarding alexander the great?

               Yes, there is a similar problem in Pakistan apparently (men owning child sex slaves quite in the open).

               It's not a theory I hold, I just asked

               whether he/she is sure that this is something that Alexander the Great brought to Afghanistan (genuineley curious). So I'd be grateful for any links / sources, too. Maybe this needs some digging.

            Thank you for sharing your friend's story--it needs to be spread far and wide. The horror of this is beyond comprehension, and the fact that leaders/controllers of "civilized" western nations condone it in order to achieve their own twisted ends is pure evil.  We MUST find a way to decapitate these vipers.
