<p>The Rajya Sabha on Monday passed by a voice vote a legislation prescribing death penalty to those convicted of raping girls below the age of 12 years and making the law against such sexual offences more stringent.</p>
<p>The Bill replaces the Criminal Law (Amendment) Ordinance promulgated on April 21, following an outcry over the rape and murder of a minor girl in Kathua in Jammu and Kashmir and the rape of another woman at Unnao in Uttar Pradesh.</p>
<p>The Lok Sabha passed the Criminal Law (Amendment) Bill 2018 on July 30.</p>
<p>Replying to a debate in the Rajya Sabha, minister of state for home affairs Kiren Rijiju assured the House that the concerns and issues raised by the members would be looked into by the government, even as he did not agree with the demand of several MPs to send the bill to a Select Committee for scrutiny.</p>
<p>Rijiju said the legislation is aimed at providing safety to minor girls as he highlighted various aspects of the measure. He said the government brought the bill with a sense of urgency because in the last few months, several heart-rending incidents of rape of under- age girls have taken place in the country.</p>
<p>Rijiju said four states had already brought a law in their respective assemblies for capital punishment those who commit rape gainst the girl child who are under the age of 12.</p>
<p>“We have introduced certain changes in the Indian Penal Code, Criminal Court Procedure, Evidence Act and there are consequential effects on prevention of atrocities against children,” the minister said.</p>
<p>The bill stipulates stringent punishment for perpetrators of rape, particularly of girls below 12 years. Death sentence has been provided for rapists of girls under 12 years. The minimum punishment in cases of rape of women has been increased from rigorous imprisonment of seven years to 10 years.</p>
<p>According to the bill, in case of rape of a girl under 16 years, the minimum punishment has been increased from 10 to 20 years, extendable to imprisonment for rest of life, which means jail term till the convict’s “natural life”.</p>
<p>Gang rape of a girl under 12 years of age will invite punishment of jail term for the rest of life or death.&quot;</p>',

            I was going to point out that this focuses on little girls and overlooks little boys,  but see you mention that at the end OP. It is a good start but should include boys too since they are also victims of filthy pedos.

            This is such great news.  Hooray for India.  Hillary won't like this. We had bad news about France and how they will put the burden on the child to defend themselves and prove they did not consent.  A Shameful Travesty.  Yes, I agree we deserve such a law here as well.  I used to be against Cap. Punish. but not in this case.

             Yes, it needs to happen everywhere, especially here.  The Supreme Court absolutely must revisit this issue.  In 2008, it decided 5-4 that death for child rape was unconstitutional.

                "A birthday gift worth half a million dollars, but no diamonds or cars.
Sir Evelyn de Rothschild, member of the Rothschild banking family and the chairman of NM Rothschild &amp; Sons, its London merchant bank, gifted his American wife Lady Lynn Forester de Rothschild an orphanage in Tamil Nadu on her 50th birthday.
"I have a great feeling of satisfaction," says a joyous Lynn, who is a member of the Council on Foreign Relations and Foreign Policy Association."

                  Also great find on "failure" of Lady Lynn Orphanage! Of course they knew NGO was unaccountable. PERFECT COVER. Is guy with the house a "madame?" Perhaps the house is where the "rich" customers stay, Yes?

                  Good research!
"Cultural exchange and learning opportunities
Our volunteer model allows travelers to take ownership of projects and see a tangible impact on the lives of children. 
A less visible, but equally real impact derives from the relationships formed with the fun-loving, outgoing children at the home. We also offer an opportunity into authentic Indian life in a town unscathed by tour buses and selfie sticks. 
We have a welcoming, international staff who will help you make the most of your time here and help see the best parts of beautiful Tamil Nadu!"

                  There is another VOAT thread about a "Gap Year" organization in Oregon with a sign that appears to have pedo symbols on it. They send students overseas to poor countries to do SJ type work projects. I wonder if they hook up with organizations like this?

                   – PMGY [Plan My Gap Year] fund and support an orphanage for 7-10 children aged from 6 to 15 years old. The orphanage is located next to the Sector 10 Volunteer House, so the children receive regular support from our volunteers. There is an orphanage mother who manages the home on a day-to day basis but volunteers play an important role in looking after the children in their free time. This ranges from helping them with their homework, to playing games. The children from the orphanage attend school during the day. Therefore volunteers tend can take part in one of our other projects during the daytime and then help out at the orphanage in the late afternoon when the children return from school."
