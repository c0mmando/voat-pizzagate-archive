            Tarantino thinks it is ok to drug and screw 13 yo girls that are "down to party". Just not his daughters. But famous people can do it to other peopls daughters.  Every death around these individuals should be scrutinized.

            I've said this before, so my apologies, but the fact that that archetypal child rapist Tarantino hasn't been #metooed leads me to believe that what he's guilty of involves much younger victims than Weinstein (my guess is &lt;13) and very satanic rituals/behaviour. The ease at which he defends the ability for a 13 year old girl to consent to sex with a 40 year old appears to me that he believes an even younger child than that could consent.

              You don't work that closely with people for that long without being totally comfortable with evil. These clowns trying to play dumb like they only ever heard fleeting rumours about this evil is a weak attempt to retain some merit in the eyes of the public.

               Agreed. Especially when dealing with someone like Weinstein or Tarantino. Hell, look at Quentin's films, he puts his weird foot fetish right in the forefront, always showing closeup shots of women's feet. And by doing so, he's making his audience participate in his fetish with him. The guy's a pervert and a notorious coke-head, and I wouldn't put anything past him.

Police said Wednesday that Menke had cut short the hike and that the other walker had continued. In addition, the article incorrectly said that Menke's dog was a yellow Labrador retriever.

              *9AM Menke and a friend go for a hike with her dog.
*About 45 minutes later Menke says she feels dizzy and said she was going to go back to her car
*Her friend continued on.
*About 15 minutes after the two split up, Menke is seen alone by another hikre.  She appeared disoriented but declined any help, 
*10:15 am she called her husband on her cell phone
*She is not seen again
*at 4PM her friends label her missing
*Her locked car is found where she left it
*At 2am her body is found at the body of a ravine
*Her dog is standing next to her and is severely dehydrated.
*There's no evidence of foul play
*Her death is later determined to be heat related.
*Menke had a history of seizures
             </p>
             <p>
              This is not a random death from hyperthermia.   This is a very specific set of facts.
             </p>
             <p>
              Now what should a good cop do with this set of facts?

               I agree we shouldn’t automatically rush to conclude John Podesta pushed her into the canyon (a mere three years after he kidnaped Madeline McCann /s). But it is very hard to get a good “set of facts”. I’ve stopped relying on what’s reported in MSM (or even by family members).

                Wow.   You can't deal with the facts can you?   You come up with a theory of foul play.  I lay out all the facts for why foul play is very unlikely and you refuse to engage the argument, you just make up lies about me.

                 You are the kind of person who thinks that "hits" and assassinations don't even exist. Your opinion means nothing, because you are nothing. No one here gives a shit about anything you say, yet you just keep on trying. Sounds like someone is getting paid for his time, or why else would you keep coming here?

             No. Sally died in 2010 (its in the title.) Tarantino was exposed only a few days ago.
            </p>
            <p>
             However, this death has always been suspicious to me. Curious if any of the good folk on these boards know of anything.
