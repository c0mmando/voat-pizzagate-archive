<p>Consider the following thought experiment. I want you to ask yourself the following questions and answer honestly using your critical thinking skills.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>We are in the middle of a special counsel probe into the 2016 election. What will the special counsel determine to be the definitive &quot;official&quot; account of who leaked the emails published by Wikileaks... Russia? Or Seth Rich? It\'s one or the other.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you answered Russia, then we know the special counsel is lying. If so, what will happen to Trump? How will his 60M+ voters react if they move towards impeachment? </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you answered Seth Rich, then we know the special counsel is telling the truth. If so, what will happen to Hilary? How will her tens of millions of supporters react?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If Seth Rich is proven by the special counsel to be the leaker, does DWS and Awan get the blame? What about Hillary? Did she know and doesn\'t that make her an accomplice? </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How about Obama? Did the former POTUS have knowledge the Wikileaks leaker was murdered? Does that make him guilty of a conspiracy to commit murder? Why did he still endorse a murderous candidate? How will Bernie Sanders supporters react with knowledge the primaries were stolen?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>At this point, the DNC, Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama are proven to have murdered the whistleblower. The mainstream media knew about it, then spent a year straight trying to frame a foreign nuclear state power, a Christian theocracy nonetheless. What\'s the punishment for murder? How about treason?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Why did they kill the whistleblower? What are the crimes contained within the emails? Why was John Podesta speaking in code about Pizza and Pasta and Walnut Sauce? What PRODUCT were the Clinton\'s selling to amass $2Billion dollars? What do Dems say about Trump now? What do they say about Obama?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If they lied about this, what else have they lied about? EVERYTHING is on the table. EVERYTHING. Sandy Hook. 9/11. Federal Reserve. NASA. Moon landing. JFK. ISIS. The Holocaust and Hitler. Why would the public believe ANYTHING the media or the government ever said? The entire 20th century is considered null and void in an instant.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What does the world look like after mass disclosure of a modern Holocaust of children?</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>This changes the world, and triggers a spiritual revival in America and across the globe. The Great Revival will be sustained for the remainder of time. However, we still trigger to WW3, a permanent Cold War, of Good versus Evil. Embrace it, because if there was ever a time for our society to completely reevaluate what it means to be human, it\'s now. </p>
<p>You really want to bring this whole system crashing down? Get down on your knees and pray. Because in America, we don\'t worship the government, we worship God. Return the Glory to him.</p>

            LOL racist power hungry greedy fucks executing a power grab at the expense of american people and you dumb fucks think it is an AWAKENING?! The only awakening is a spiritual one that has been going on and although politics plays a small part, it is mostly smoke and mirrors. Ya'll dumb fucks are still well under control of your Jew overlords. Work, pay taxes, obey authority, dont question establishment.. yup, ya'll are obedient little debt slaves. No awakening for you zombies LOL

            If this is true, will it include all her crimes?, I find this very discouraging, the Trump DOJ letting her walk, Sessions is a joke and, many people on both sides are so involved in all this smorgasbord of crimes, that to cover each others butts is all they care about, and if Trump allows it maybe he is in with them as well....I am beginning to think the only way out of this is by a huge uprising of the people, but that is never going to happen because, almost a year later we can't even get a decent protest march going for PG/PedoGate.....I am a Christian but, I have not seen to many Religious leaders or churches etc getting involved in any of this, the church has been very quiet, so doesn't seem they are putting on their armor, but rather hiding in their church waiting for it to pass over.

             I had been detached from a large portion of my family that are of ' Christian faith ' until last October when I began to tune in more to that spiritual faith I had been taught as a child.
            </p>
            <p>
             The churches they attend seem to know what is goin on 'as it relate to the dark occult'  but are not speaking mater of factly on the revelations of PG and It's ties to the darker side of a luciferian cult that run this world. Churches messages is mostly the pastors own interpretation of his studies which they then convey in allegory stories/summary  ...some priests /pastors being more truthfull or 'awake than others.
            </p>
            <p>
             The people of these churches have a continued belief that worship is more important than being present.  Not acting now and waiting for a savior. 
The Christian institutions need to have a unified message to give to their leaders and let the elite  cults of this world KNOW that the veil is lifting and humanity is here to rids the world of the vampiric evil energy
            </p>
            <p>
             If all Christian institutions could send one clear message to the current state of affairs that would be a good catalyst on awakening humanity for their own good

              The church always seems to sleep through so many important things as of late, there was a time when the church was at the front of the fight, no longer is that the case.....I no longer attend church because it has become more a place of entertainment, social gatherings and, messages of milk, no meat, feel good stuff, a lot of PC happening, I like what you say, you summarized it well, they wait for the Savior and do not engage. Worship is important, but being present is as well.....Being a Christian I realize God will be the victor, but His people do Him a disservice in the mean time, especially those called to His service to teach and lead them.

             There is absolutely no way Trump DOJ will let her walk. Because if she walks, Trump is now complicit in the crimes and responsible for all future crimes. Does he want that as his reputation? Not a chance. It's all or nothing.

              I would love to feel the same way, but the whole world is turned upside down, it just seems everyone is dragging their feet to get the ball rolling on the crimes of the last 8 years of Obama, as well as PG, yet all we hear constantly are the supposed crimes of Trump and his people, it is like we still have the democrats running everything as usual when republicans are in control.....it has always been that way because republicans don't fight back unless they are fighting with their own guys.

                I will try but, not much longer, something has to give soon. :).....republicans may loose one of the houses if they make the people to mad with their bickering among themselves, and then nothing will definitely happen is my fear.

            Finally, my brothers, be strong in the Lord, and in the power of his might. 11Put on the whole armor of God, that you may be able to stand against the wiles of the devil. 12For we wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against principalities, against powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this world, against spiritual wickedness in high places. 13Why take to you the whole armor of God, that you may be able to withstand in the evil day, and having done all, to stand. 14Stand therefore, having your loins girt about with truth, and having on the breastplate of righteousness; 15And your feet shod with the preparation of the gospel of peace; 16Above all, taking the shield of faith, with which you shall be able to quench all the fiery darts of the wicked. 17And take the helmet of salvation, and the sword of the Spirit, which is the word of God:

            Said it before and I will say it again...use logic, not emotion and consider how many "disclosure" trains are running...they all lead to the same places and same conclusions.  While not on the same "train" as

            we both arrive at the same conclusions that the world is getting ready to change in a BIG way.  I agree on spiritual awakening and choice...I would even go a step further and say we are in "beginning" times not "end" times.  The CHOADS and fucksticks wanted it to end like the bible...not gonna go down that way...

               I was and still am to a point very much a fan of Peterson but alas I believe he may be another dis-info agent.  It pains me so but I can't elect my objectivity and critical judgement when it suits me.

                 My suspicions were raised when I considered all the interviews he's done with (imo) shills such as Molyneux, Rogan, Rubin, Rebel Media et al.  I am immediately sceptical of anyone who receives mainstream attention (Rogan on Netflix) or has a slick and polished repertoire (Molyneux, Rubin, RM) and Peterson's connection with these guys raises a red flag for me.  He's a cult of personality &amp; born from the Alt-Right (astroturfed movement) and practically came out of nowhere.  He's also managed to keep his job at a cucked Canadian University, promulgates (((individualism))), equates the war on gender with the Holocaust (I am a revisionist in this respect) and a scholarly fellow like Peterson will know that the Holocaust was largely a hoax so why does he promote the deception?!  He says all the right things &amp; his sophistry commands respect and trust and this strategy could be interpreted as dis-info agent, limited hangout stuff.  He also from time to time subtly endorses Trump and legitimises mainstream media:

                  http://i.imgur.com/rEgM9uv.jpg
                 </a>
                </p>
                <p>
                 He also brazenly promoted this occultic t-shirt a few weeks back:
                 <a href="http://i.imgur.com/wZhMp1W.jpg">

                 </a>
                </p>
                <p>
                 Anyhow the guy is a brain and I agree with much of what he says and will continue to cherry pick from his performances.

                 <p>
                  Perhaps an easy to understand equatable idea?  I am not sure if he is promoting holocaust so much as using the conception, but I don't really know anything about it, my speculation holds zero grounds or value.  Not saying remotely he hasn't mentioned the holocaust, simply that I've never heard him talking about it before personally.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  The bottom line for me about him is he has some insanely potent ideas on some key concepts like organization/behavior and marxism.  I've read a ton of stuff on the subject of marxism, the communist manifesto, seen various videos, but the way he puts the idea, especially in critical seemingly unexplored versions, seems vital in my mind.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  If he is some sort of puppet, the information seems like way too much of a dip.  All I hear is 'this is some of the unseen gamut of marxism today that is rotting nations' on the subject of marxism.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  If several diverse individuals over the past 100 years, starting from marx, hitler, bezmenov to peterson and so many others are all speaking about an idea in very similar and interesting respects, basically on marxist communism, I take the statements with little inner quarrel.  Not to say I disagree with what you've presented, only to paint my view a little more clearly.  I think understanding communism/marxism more deeply today may be vital.

                   Great response and you make some salient points.  Regarding my (((individualism))) statement, the parentheses symbolise the potential Jewish interests that influence his overt message of the preservation of self and one that has to be partially sacrificed for the sake of the community.  This in itself does not sound like a bad thing but the self that he promotes is one that derives from a position of Christianity and this in turn is an affront to secular individualism.  Anyway, I am prepared to concede that I may be over analysing this point but it's something that I have given some thought to and it may be pernicious subversion.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   His comparison of gender pronoun discrimination to the Holocaust troubles me because it's his attempt to illustrate how something innocuous (pronouns) should not be taken seriously unlike the Holocaust.  This infers that he is either ignorant of the truth or supports the deception and I don't believe it's the former.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   Finally as I stated, it's his connection to dubious figures in the Alt-Right and the fact he occasionally gets a mention in the MSM that leads me to believe he's one of 'theirs’s'.  Why would he be promoted like this and have his position reinstated at the liberalist Toronto Uni if his views and influence were a genuine threat to the status quo and their agenda?
                  </p>

                   What a world of smoke &amp; mirrors hey?!

                    Yeah, totally.  Such is the nature of marxism.  On the subject on marxism, I've been reading Adolf Hitlers Mein Kampf recently, his words mirror a lot of ideas and subjects related to marxism I see today, it is exciting.

                    He may well be a form of controlled opposition, as is seen in the media today else where.  It is an excellent point and one I keep in mind.

                     Well going by your handle, I had a suspicion you might be a Hitler admirer.  I haven't yet read Mein Kampf but do mean to as I am very dubious about what I've been taught reg Hitler and WW2 in general.  I am currently ambivalent towards historical figures such as Hitler due to the overwhelming amount of subterfuge and lack of concrete evidence to support any avowed claims but there is a strong possibility that Hitler himself was controlled opp and many compelling and logical reasons to believe he was persist.

                     This may provide food for thought:

                      I've read similar things and ideas and considered this myself, I was suspicious about the events surrounding Hitlers death.    I can only conclude that I am skeptical either way.  It feels a bit like asking yourself if jesus existed or if maybe he was just an ordinary man or there was a great deal of exaggeration.  Usually when I begin learning on a new subject and discuss a topic with various experts, be this something from engineering and science to historical information and human behavior I aways find there are at least two or three firm camps absolutely certain of their views and absolutely convinced the other side is retarded.  Perhaps this is typical to human behavior and an inescapable fact.

                      The handle was really originally about the lunacy of marxism in how to do anything that would speak against even the idea of affirmative action, which is obviously anti-white, will earn you the title a white supremacist and racist by marxists.

                       I think you're right an it reminds me of the saying, 'there's three sides to every story, your side, my side and the truth'.  It's been really nice talking with you and it's reassuring to come across someone who has a measured grasp of reality.  I have a YouTube channel under my handle 'Amino' and many videos that I think would interest you so drop by and keep in touch if you like.  All the best.

            Apologies for the initial negativity in this post but I feel a dose of reality and objectivity is required.
           </p>
           <p>
            TL;DR - We're fucked but maybe not!
           </p>
           <p>
            I had a conversation with an old childhood friend the other day and it dawned on me, once again, the battle we're up against.  This individual is in his late thirties, two kids, happily married and financially comfortable and has an above average IQ.  We got on to the subject of 911 (at this point anyone who has engaged even the slightest modicum of critical thinking understands that this was an establishment orchestrated event) and although he's willing to accept that something smells off with the official explanation, he stops short of supporting the facts as we know them.  His justification was that until he sees something with his own eyes, he refuses to believe conspiracy theories.  He is hopelessly conditioned and inhabits a solipsistic merry-go-round and until something threatens him, his family or way of life, he's content to keep his head buried.  He is certainly not alone and I would hazard a guess that globally 911 deniers i.e. truthers are still well in the minority.  I don't even bother to broach the more esoteric subjects with him as it would be like talking Chinese to a rock and expecting a response in Gaelic.  It is sad and frustrating but something that every one of us can relate to and in my case, this myopia afflicts the majority of people I know.  The decades of social indoctrination have been stupendously successful!
           </p>
           <p>
            Using 911 as a kind of litmus test and baseline to measure public gullibility and obsequity, it is patently clear that even now after centuries of numerous and obvious false flags, Gov corruption, media and police collusion, illegal wars, sponsored coups, hijacked revolutions etc, that the general public CANNOT be awoken and jolted into lasting action.  The Cabal know this and have engineered our societies to exploit and capitalise on our inadequacy to recognise our enslavement.  They have been and are always several steps ahead of us, afforded this advantage through centuries of coercion and fine tuning.  They are so sure of their supremacy they even rejoice in mocking us through hidden in plain sight occultic symbolism and predictive programming in all forms of media and industry.  They needn’t be this cavalier and brazen about their regard for us yet they are and this tells us all we need to know about the scale of their dominion.  They are so confident they have us caged that they openly tell us, to our faces (albeit codified) what they have done and will do.  I will also add that I believe the existence of Magick among other atavistic arcana is genuine and has played a significant part in human history.

            Every generation has a cohort of 'truthers' and anarchists and it's obvious to anyone who has studied this tautology that history does so with curious consistency.  Our generation has a romantic notion that because we are living in the digital age and have access to the greatest communication device ever created (internet) that we have the opportunity to bring about a critical mass in the awakening of others that will ultimately result in our salvation.  Wrapped up in this tumult of excitement and fervent positivity, most fail to grasp that the very instrument to which we rely on for this outcome started out as a private military contractor invention – the internet was ostensibly created by DARPA!  Following on from this, Tim Berners-Lee (strawman?) gifted humanity the worldwide web and we were off… There now must be the fertilisation of thought that we have walked straight into a giant honey trap that may close in on us if they choose it to.
           </p>
           <p>
            For centuries we as a species have studied ourselves and how we work to great effect.  The knowledge gained from this introspection and observation is the foundation for the very conspiracy itself.  In recent times, the likes of Freud, Bernays, Jung and the Frankfurt School have plumbed these depths even further and some for the purposes of total species enslavement.  In essence, they now know us better than we know ourselves and have practically every angle of attack and defence covered.  However we must take responsibility for our collective actions and a quote that inspires this necessity is, “Until you make the unconscious conscious, it will direct your life and you will call it fate.” – Jung.
           </p>
           <p>
            And now for the positives as this polemic could go on ad infinitum.  We could well be on the cusp of something paradigm changing that may result in either global annihilation or liberation or…further drudgery.  It is not just the internet that we can hope to rely on but something far more metaphysical.  In the last decade there has been a noticeable shift as we can all appreciate in people questioning ‘the system’ and becoming more recalcitrant in response.  This can only be regarded as a positive thing (even if this shift is intentionally engineered by TPTB) as it’s driven by positive energy for the purposes of self-preservation.  This wave is only going to get bigger and our voice louder as the momentum is there and the zeitgeist is shifting.  As a species we are transitioning existentially but to where at this point is hard to tell.  It will invariably get worse before it gets better but I believe in the inexorable universal positives of love, beauty, truth and justice and one day these will triumph.

             We are not here to recruit or wake people up. The only great battle of Good vs Evil (the only one that matters, anyway) is the one we fight in ourselves every moment. Take care of what's in front of you, and everything else takes care of itself.

            So when you call someone a "Luciferian," do you mean it literally? Like they worship the devil of the Christian bible? Being very familiar with the occult, I have never encountered a legitimate Christian devil worshipper (that wasn't 16 and shopped exclusively at Hot Topic).
           </p>

            I ask because I have known a few LaVey-an satanists, which use the symbol as sort of a mockery of religion-derived ethics. Very different.

            I went from normal Tea Party type.....to pretty much this concept in two weeks after November Election with the breaking of Pizzagate.....understanding the evil we are facing makes me question everything I ever thought was true.

           <p>
            Shocking stuff but a slaughter is around the corner....either they unleash their EMP burst and all their human created plagues and hide in the bunkers we built for them with tax payer money.....and slaughter as many of us as they can.....
           </p>
           <p>
            Or they are going to die....and we use DNA to root out the bloodline families and finish them off once and for all....

            Force Lucifer to start over with his favorites.....because this group is done.

            Muller doesnt give a shit that Seth leaked emails. Everyone knows it already. The probe is designed to railroad the president. They must malign President Trump's ethical reputation before they take him out. Otherwise he's martryd and a half million oath takers roll up on DC.

            Having browsed a lot of "liberal" sites, I do have to admit many will simply dismiss Pizzagate out of partisan politics.  Although they will jump on any news stories regarding pedo allegations against Trump or any conservative/Republican...
           </p>
           <p>
            Another reason they will dismiss the OP and Pizzagate in general is that they see Christians (especially right-wing evangelical/fundamentalist types) as being a big part of the problem itself.  Especially when it comes to their Zionism and neocon warmongering, which ironically is a HUGE contributor to Pizzagate.
           </p>
           <p>
            A significant proportion of liberals/leftists are non-religious/agnostic or even outright atheist.

            None of that will be happening if we are in the middle of World War 3 with N. Korea. This world is just crazy right now, no matter which way we turn. If the elites feel like they are going down, there would be no better time than now to go to war right? War makes them richer and all attention would be on that instead of their crimes. Things aren't looking too good.

              I feel so sad for the people in North Korea who have this evil psycho leader that is putting their lives at risk. So many people and families will be killed. I would hate to be the one that had to make the decision to strike.

              It's horrible. Since news, internet, radio and tv is all censored there, it makes me wonder what these people know. I wonder if they even know they are in danger. I think I'd rather not know. He has so many people brainwashed that people even worship him. He's sick!

              Those occur cause of farming and can be found all over the place, even America. The blood lake would be caused by actual death, rising up to the stomache of horses.

             The original meaning of apocalypse means "revelation of truth", not cataclysm. IIRC the word is Greek in origin. Could be wrong.

            Getting reminded of a thread I made a while back asking us how we're gonna handle the fallout of pizzagate.
           </p>
           <p>
            When the shit hits the fan and the awakeninf to the truth happens, we need to be there for the masses. It will be up to us to ensure that they don't "black pill", with the dispensing of black pills being the agenda of certain shills around here. Be on the lookout for the warning signs of "black pilled" individuals. These include nihilistic (note: anti nihilism is closer in nature to the other final form of the red pill) outlooks, "let the world burn" viewpoints, advocation of violence and persecution of entire groups of largely innocent people as scapegoats. I for one have made my choice to let my red pill's final form be the "white pill", not the black pill.
           </p>
           <p>
            From their perspective, it will appear that the people they respected, trusted, and regarded as heroes have all collectively betrayed them. We will need to step up to the plate and shown them that good people/heroes still exist. We must bear the mantle and become both the hero the world deserves and the hero it needs right now. It will be up to us to be bringers of hope to them.
           </p>
           <p>
            Are you prepared for the possibility of having to testify in these pedo bastard's trials. I know this may reopen whatever psychological scars this investigation has caused, but it is something we have to think about.

             When PG does hit the fan, which it will, it will take a enormous abeyance of pattern recognition to not see the droves of Jews being exposed at the very top. It will be the summer of '33 in this bitch.

              Tsk tsk. It should be clear as day what we're facing here are satanists/luciferians, with whatever religion those losers claim to be being their "cover". Some like the Bushes, the Vatican, and high level Jesuits disguise themselves as Christians, while others prefer to disguise themselves as jews. In eastern countries, I'm sure there's satanists posing as buddhists involved with this crap for crying out loud. Either way, I don't care, for I hate them all equally for being monsters who kill the innocent and defile the little ones.

              So what was that about me being "not forgetting to cuck for the kike"? Dumb ass shill.

               Been saying this as well. The people who hate jews use pizzagate to confirm their suspicion. When it's not all jews and it's not only jews.
              </p>
              <p>
               I realize a lot of the delinquents are jews/pose as jews, but many of the best PG researchers are also jews. The antisemitism discredits us.

                    Case in point, the same is true for satanists - last I checked they're pretty specific about doing no harm to children and those who otherwise don't deserve it.

                     That was my main qualm with LaVey. "Save your love for people that deserve it," and "save your hate for people that deserve it" seem entirely contrary to what is considered psychologically healthy. The whole thing just seems antisocial.

                      Hahaha, I can't disagree there. I make no claim to be a follower, but maybe the underlying point is to be discerning of where(to whom) and how you direct your energy/thoughts/intentions.

                       Yeah, and I understood that while I was reading his books, but on the surface it seems very emotionally immature and while you could extract that concept from his material, his choice of that particular example kinda solidifies my stance.

                       Like, only a person with the capacy to have such thoughts would be able to put them out there in such a serious fashion, to an extent.

                        Agreed. Not the best delivery, but, most any religion goes to some effort to obfuscate it's teachings and test the reader/initiate.

               Everyone you mention are "shills" for the Jewish elite. You act like this whole thing isn't about dealing with sick fucks who have financed both sides of wars for the best part of two fucking millenia. They aren't the Jesuits or luciferians, lol.

               I have no doubts that there are a lot of people who "wear the mask" of other groups, so to speak, to misdirect our attentions. But what is more probable: that all these disparate groups are in cahoots when we know the vast sums of money at stake even before we caught on, or that this is all a shell game orchestrated by a chosen (ironic?) few individuals who are so disconnected from reality that there is some benefit to them corrupting decent people to do the worst things to further their goals?

                While I commend the fervor of the investigators here and their growing understanding that this is a war over more than just land, money, flesh and blood, there's a sorely pervasive idea that "it's the jews" or "it's the satanists" (pick any religion that alludes to the use of magic, they've copped the blame here) -
               </p>
               <p>
                Very few stop to consider that maybe, just maybe, it's actually as you describe, Red_Lindy... that individuals(a group albeit, but not any single entire religion and it's followers that I can tell) with knowledge shared by religions x/y/z, have taken to using their knowledge against the masses on a scale which is otherwise unimaginable, if you've been convinced(via hollywood and etc) that "magic" is merely the stuff of fantasy.
               </p>
               <p>
                You said it yourself, darkknight111, you want a white pill result not black, by wantonly lumping "satanists/luciferians" in with these sick fucks, you are closer to being black-pilled than you think - you're not the only one who does it though, many posters here have the best of intentions but are still programmed to point the finger at "satan", or whatever the boogeyman of the day is.
               </p>
               <p>
                I don't mean to sound like some random who's just showing up on occasion to stir shit, I mean all this with respect, but the whole theme of "blame the satanists", being espoused by those who may be biased by Christianity/Catholicism or otherwise are ignorant of satanism/luciferianism, leads around in circles and it results in the loss of allies, allies who have not repressed magic from their lives/studies and who may therefore prove to be vital in the very near future.
               </p>
               <p>
                I''m sure the above will sound ridiculous to some, because "magic", not my problem if you believe in it or not, it changes nothing.

                 Pizzagate, and everything it encapsulates, including the 2016 election, made me go back to church for sure. I knew evil existed. I even knew evil was rampant. But I didn't understand the profound nature of evil until the Spirit Cooking emails broke the weekend before the election, and the subsequent media blackout / backlash.

                 Anyone in the know about PG from late 2016- early 2017 has been assigned a divine mission IMO. When confronted with that sort of calling, you have to answer it. So I went back to church.

            The gov will lie about everything.  Proof or not
They put the last nail in the coffin.   No going back
National debt is insurmountable.   We are this close to the NWO.   The illuminiti has all but 3 countries under their belt.   Another war, maybe maybe not but we won't win.   America doesn't win wars only fights them 
We have been brought down a liberal path. It took many years to get here.  Will take twice as many to get back 🙁  Can't leave, no where to go anyway

            <p>
             Or it would be more accurate to say that it is the neocons and the MIC that are the ones who are calling the shots now and threatening those two countries.

             My sources say the military is at least 90% patriot. That's why a military coup will never work and the deep state knows it. Remember, we have the veterans too. 1 veteran can train about 100 civilians how to fight.

            If the Awans were running this scam for 14 years, where else are they - or someone else - running it?  Didn't Obama have a "special" blackberry?  And Hillary at State.  And probably some of their corporate friends were tipped off about the snooping possibilities.  It can get to things Palantir can only dream about.

             Where are they is an excellent question..... No mug shot,,, no video of the arrest at a VERY public international airport.... In and out of govt buildings for 14 years and the only proof of life they have is some crappy photo shopped picture...?.... Where are these guys...? and do they even exist...? Because if its evil, and criminal, these batshits thought of it...
I suspect the old  Fake Identity Long Con for future buck passing... and until I see some actual footage of these guys in action, I don't believe they exist.... Im shocked anyone does.

            Yes, but there's more. The Cannibal Elites are already preparing for the release of a video featuring The Kenyan. They're already advancing the narrative that the Russians can fake video and it's hard to tell if someone really said that.
           </p>
           <p>
            If they're advancing that narrative, pretty sure the special counsel will have to lie to keep Russia in the loop. Especially if the video is on someone's computer. Then they would have had to have hacked into it to get it on there, wouldn't they?

             Just today there was some Arizona politician who had lewd pics of himself on twitter claiming he was hacked.

              As this post points out, the two opposing sides are not going to back down. The Cannibal Elites can't. They have too much to lose. The anti-Cannibal Elites can't. If we don't vote out the corruption now, there may not be another chance. And those that are voted out due to crimes need to go to jail for what they've done.

            I agree it is inevitable, but I think they can draw it out and the awakening will be slower paced and controlled. In any case, I agree there will be a resurgence in religion and morals. And that is a good thing. Many people badly need a wake-up call.
           </p>
           <p>
            I personally "woke up" to pizzagate, and naturally I questioned everything else as well. Same thing will happen with the public. We are going to be the ones to help people make the transition.

             This is an archived book. It's very long. "The Matrix Deciphered".
            </p>
            <p>
             The author states it is non-fiction. If these things are true, we have been hoodwinked for a long, long time.
            </p>
            <p>
             After reading about half of it, I was actually ready to put on a tin foil hat. No shit.
            </p>
            <p>
             It winds it all together. Practically every "gate" is woven into this book.

              Literally, I was (maybe 13 at the time? i forget) asleep (non-us citizen) and awoke to a commotion in the lounge - the incident was being broadcast live, saw plane 2 hit.
             </p>
             <p>
              Unfortunately, it took many more years before I started questioning the narrative - never had a reason to.

               It's amazing how you remember where you were and what you were doing when something big hits. I remember I was holding a baby and my friend called screaming to turn on the news. I think I saw the 2nd plane hit. I was so confused. I kept it on the news channel for days.
              </p>
              <p>
               Well, you were only 13 so I think most people wouldn't be questioning it at your age.

                It really is, funnily enough, the commotion in the house was over something unrelated, but it just so happened that I had been awoken and was the only one watching the TV as it happened, others were attending to a minor emergency with a sibling.
               </p>
               <p>
                We had the TV on all day that day too though, confusion and disbelief were rampant for a while, that's for sure.
               </p>
               <p>
                A lot changed that day... it took me nearly a decade to begin to grasp the breadth of the situation. I was a real dick before I realized that I was being fed bullshit re "terrorists", still kinda ashamed of that part of my life. Ah well...

                 Wow. I hated it because nobody around me understood. I didn't watch the news much. I was naive and young I guess because I barely even knew what terrorism was. I couldn't grasp that someone would kill themselves so that they could kill others and think that it's what their God wanted. I really got into alternative news when NOBODY around me did. It was so frustrating. They thought I was nutty because I didn't believe. Now alternative news is everywhere.

                       This "Narwhal Jews" thing is a new term on my radar, popped back on here today to see where things had gone since my last checkin (around the time of chester's murder), I'm not oblivious to the fact that some other undefinable 'urge' pulled me back here today though - so if someone wants to talk, I'm all ears, but no bs :)

                        I know what you mean. There are more shills here now than there were in the past in my opinion. I used to be so nice at first because I wasn't used to this. I was like, can't we just get along? That didn't work lol. I've ended up becoming a bitch on here sometimes. Only to haters.

                         Oh, I'm being particularly patient with figuring out what the angle is on this one - I'm over being angered by them, it's basically a secondary objective for them alongside the disinformation(that is, to rile us up and make us unhinged and dysfunctional).

                        <p>
                         It's pretty hard to just push aside the fact that a shill has made the choice to side with 'evil', but, I'm finding it easier with time, to just look at them with a bit of pity and give them ample chance to demonstrate a capacity to be genuinely human(e), if they can't, well, they'll have to square with that one day - not I.

                         In the mean time, I don't mind being the lightning rod on occasion.

                          I think it's entertaining sometimes. But, it got really personal with one of them who has several different profiles. So I'm a royal bitch to him and enjoy it.

                           I wholeheartedly agree, it's entertaining as fuck to unleash on the ones that don't know when to cut the shit - the ones who don't know when they're caught, or do but continue anyway.

                           Nevermind how br00tal some of them try to be in order to appear edgy and in-the-know, that shit just reminds me of teenagers listening to death metal for the first time xD

                            Lol. It started off with a regular here. He's on daily. His acts too. Even in the same thread 🤣 If you go thru my comment history, you'll figure it out. Lol. But, he's psycho and hates women. So, I went straight for his masculinity and dick size and he FLIPPED! Haha. I'm called a slut and a stupid cunt on the daily 😁

                         You have allies on the ground if that's the case, and, I guess the same goes if you're against us mere hoomans - one way or another, I must say that the talking in circles is a turn-off.
My offer stands for a straight-forward, private conversation.

                             You've refused to be straight-forward and haven't sent me that private message, yet have plenty of time to talk nonsense in the comments here... I dunno, it all says that on some level, you're being purposefully disingenuous - I apologize if I'm wrong, but if I'm not, well, whatever... talk shit, don't talk shit, it doesn't change much in the end...
                            </p>

            Russia could still take credit for the hack.  Nobody would even give a shit if they did and there would certainly be no war over it.

Go create another 6-12 hr name for yourself defending the people who pay you.  You will never be red pilled b/c you don't want to be, your happy in your profit? induced coma.

             Why would Russian take credit for the hack?  Most likely Trump has all he needs to prove what he needs to prove.  He just needs Mueller , the mighty just and fair one blessed by both parties, to give the judgement for him.
