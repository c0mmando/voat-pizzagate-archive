            I was in a institution from 16-18. I came across a lot of kids who I had no idea of their background, fast forward to now and some of the people that the institution allowed us to interact with seemed kind of off. This one guy with a sports car who really wanted to go on a hike with me up this rarely traversed mountain strikes as oddest. Glad I never talked to that most likely child fucker/killer again,

            This is often all these people--the prostituted--know.  They go from one form of abuse to another.  Many times it's in an effort to re-frame their childhood abuse; to try to get power over it, instead of the trauma having power over them.

            Great post.
           </p>
           <p>
            Very depressing, sickening, and, unfortunately, the truth. It's why we're all here, battling to be heard. I will repeat again, "GET INVOLVED"! That means on any level you can. Run for community boards, volunteer for charities, start a petition to strike down proposed legislation that would be detrimental to children being human trafficked.
           </p>
           <p>
            If all you can do is post here, then so be it, but The Cannibal Elite got to where they are by people working for them at the grassroots level. Think about it and act accordingly.

             Couldn't have said it better myself. Of course this is the worst case scenario type of shit I don't want to think about, but that doesn't make it less prevalent. Ugh.

              Yes, it is the worst case, but the fact it goes on at all is so disturbing. And some of these cases, you have to think it was purposefully done. Otherwise, how would a known pedo even be on the "safe" list of those approved for fostering children?
