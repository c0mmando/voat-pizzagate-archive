            The Texas shooter was 23 when he exited the AF, 21 when he was put in the brig and 19 when he entered the service. Some of his high school class mates described him as odd even then. What happened in the service to make him so violent?
How has he been earning a living since the service?

            The Airforce produced Dr. Bruce Jessen and Dr.Elmer Mitchell, psychologists that went on to take their Fairchild,WA AFB program of teaching resistance to torture and turning it into the reverse at Guantanamo (rectal feeding, sleep deprivation,waterboarding,etc) and pocketing $81 million from the CIA.

            Don't forget Lt. Col. Michael Aquino who served as Research and Analysis team leader at 7th PSYOP Group in San Francisco in the 1980s and before that in 1967-68 participated in Operation Phoenix in Vietnam. This murderous psyop program had the effect of creating legions of cold-blooded psychopathic killers who would return home to the USA as completely different people than when they left.

            MKULTRA mind-control victim Cathy O’Brien claimed that she was programmed at Fort Campbell, Kentucky, in 1980 by Lt. Col. Michael Aquino of the US Army. He is also implicated in the Johnny Gosch kidnapping: According to Bonacci, the abduction was ordered by Lt. Col. Michael Aquino, who later picked Gosch up at a farmhouse he was being held at and delivered him to a buyer in Colorado. For years, both boys were used for the pedophiliac pleasures of high-ranking government officials.
 In the 1980s in San Francisco, many children abused at army daycare center id'd Aquino as their abuser.1990 (August 31) – Lt. Col. Michael Aquino was processed out of the Army after being investigated for satanic ritual child abuse in the Presidio case. Although never formally charged, according to court documents, Aquino was ‘titled’ in a Report of Investigation by the Army’s Criminal Investigative Division (CID) for “indecent acts with a child, sodomy, conspiracy, kidnapping, and false swearing”.

            Military service can be a hazard to your mental health if you fall into the hands of psyop practitioners.

            This is not the correct perspective. The Air Force is by far the worst hangout for these Hivite scum. It's completely infested with them. This is highlighting the connections for the American people to understand what is going on. How did this man legally obtain weapons when he had no legal right to them? Because a Hivite drone at work in the admin office intentionally 'forgot' to send it along to the FBI. The military is good and on our side, but there is no institution in America where these terrorists haven't infiltrated at lower levels for just this sort of action.

            In the big scheme of things the Texas shooting is a blip on the radar. Think bigger. I'm not saying that the following is the end all be all but I can assure you the big players are not focused on that church shooting.

             The aide said that guys like me were 'in what we call the reality-based community,' which he defined as people who 'believe that solutions emerge from your judicious study of discernible reality.' [...] 'That's not the way the world really works anymore,' he continued. 'We're an empire now, and when we act, we create our own reality. And while you're studying that reality—judiciously, as you will—we'll act again, creating other new realities, which you can study too, and that's how things will sort out. We're history's actors…and you, all of you, will be left to just study what we do'.

            The military would have to be cleaned out first. The Navy is an absolute cess pool, maybe the worst, and the other are full of bad actors too. With characters like Acquino loose in our military i'm not sure who can be trusted.

             Fat Leonard investigation is cleaning house in the Navy.

            <blockquote>
             <p>
              ‘Fat Leonard’ probe expands to ensnare more than 60 admirals
             </p>
             <p>
              The “Fat Leonard” corruption investigation has expanded to include more than 60 admirals and hundreds of other U.S. Navy officers under scrutiny for their contacts with a defense contractor in Asia who systematically bribed sailors with sex, liquor and other temptations, according to the Navy.
             </p>
             <p>
              Most of the admirals are suspected of attending extravagant feasts at Asia’s best restaurants paid for by Leonard Glenn Francis, a Singapore-based maritime tycoon who made an illicit fortune supplying Navy vessels in ports from Vladivostok, Russia to Brisbane, Australia. Francis also was renowned for hosting alcohol-soaked, after-dinner parties, which often featured imported prostitutes and sometimes lasted for days, according to federal court records.

            Eh, they’ve been trying to destroy the military for years.  The women in combat and transgender push are much bigger dangers than this.

             What a stupid comment, that women and transgenders are a bigger danger. Seriously. Both women and transgender individuals have served effectively in the military for decades.

              See, the media already fucking hates the military. This isn’t new information, and it’s not a new situation.  They’ve been gunning for it for years.
             </p>
             <p>
              Women in combat, however, represent an existential threat to our combat effectiveness that absolutely will get people killed.  It has much more direct, real-world consequences.

            So OP is an idiot, because that shit is not true (of all the vast amounts of porn I saw while there, CP never came up), and besides, very few officers and even fewer JAGs are actually grads.
           </p>
           <p>
            Anyway, CP has nothing to do with somebody at Holloman failing to file the appropriate paperwork.  You’d be shocked at how badly non-aircraft-related paperwork is handled.

             If that is so, thank you for your service. But your experience does not define everyone's. There is massive evidence of BAD CP and rape/abuse on MILITARY BASES, esp overseas. This has been documented by many sources -- the most disturbing being in the Middle East. See NY TIMES:
             <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/21/world/asia/us-soldiers-told-to-ignore-afghan-allies-abuse-of-boys.html">

            </p>
            <p>
             I'm well aware of how slow paperwork is processed -- in almost any and every government office. The point isn't that this is one of hundreds of possible errors. The point is that the Air Force will take the blame for letting "this one" thru.

             shit, youd be shocked at how badly aircraft related paperwork is handled. AF wide paperwork is a problem. its a never ending cycle. 
1 pile paper work on a problem till it interferes with work
2  mandate 12 hour work days.
3 incident happens
4 compile more paper work till total break down of the system.
5 replace said leader.
6 cut paper work load. 
7 work returns to normal .
8 jack ass arrives finds a problem that is not there 
back to step 1
