<p>He left a suicide note proclaiming that he himself was a victim of child sexual abuse.  Here\'s a quote from the note.
&quot;I found myself drawn to videos that matched my own childhood abuse.  It’s painful and humiliating to admit to myself, let alone the whole world, but I pictured myself as a child in the image or video.  The more an image mirrored some element of my memories and took me back, the more I felt a connection.&quot;</p>

<p>In investigating this I encountered a blog post that I considered speculative in nature.  It ties Lamar Alexander to two childcare businesses, which is troubling if Jesse Loskarn was part of a larger child porn ring.  The blog post also links Alexander to the Penn State and Franklin child sexual abuse scandals through associates.</p>

<p>I began fact checking this blog post.  Lamar Alexander was indeed a founder of a child daycare company that merged with Bright Horizons to become the largest provider of worksite daycare.  Alexander co-founded the company with Bob Keeshan who played the Captain Kangaroo character in the children\'s television program &quot;Captain Kangaroo.&quot;  Bright Horizons was acquired by Mitt Romney\'s investment firm Bain Capital in 2008.</p>

<p>Jim Henry is another Republican politician from Tennessee.  He was a representative in the TN state house at the same time Lamar Alexander was Governor of TN.  They had at least a working relationship.  Jim Henry is president and CEO of a company named Omni Visions, another childcare business.  Omni Visions also places children in foster homes.  I found several documented cases of abuse and death of children placed by Omni Visions.</p>

<p>Quote from article above: &quot;A former mayor of Kingston, Henry started Omni Visions, the largest provider of in-home care for special needs children in Tennessee and North Carolina.&quot;</p>
<p>Omni Visions placed 16 year old in foster home where he was choked to death by foster dad</p>

            Holy sxxx. This is really good research and relevant. I only found it on a google search for him after reading about the larger bust. 8 comments is disgusting. The larger clue is just how big this bust was in 2013 that ran from what, 2010. And he's still in office. AAAAAGHHHHH.
