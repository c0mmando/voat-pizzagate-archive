pizzagate is a psyop. Gelitin did a painting of it in 2001, you can find it toward the bottom of the page on Gelitin.net (they did the performance art for 911 before 911)
the only victims are regina lapp (22 female) who died of unkown causes in the Pajama factory(Which is where werkinonmahnightcheese, has an actual killroom, he wrote killroom on the front door of, and posted pics to instagram-see pizzagate wiki Jeff Smith) 
Alefantis himself had the Pajama factory video taken down, but he won\'t take down the Pegasus video that has been uploaded to another channel. 
Other victim is Caris Cummings(taped to a table on alefantis instagram with man standing behind. 
This may the same girl as posted to Pizza Brain\'s website wearing a shirt that says &quot;pizza slut&quot;, making a child wear that, warrants a investigation of Pizza Brain.
Pizza Brain is connected to Little Baby\'s icr cream. 
LIttle babys ice cream went viral back in 2012(over 11million views of youtubers who made reaction videos saying Little babys ice cream is serial killer pedo dog whistling, for the same reason that alefantis instagram went viral, because of blatant serial killer pedo dog whistling(part of an obvious psyop since this youtube pizza pedo flash mob also included, Paperboy Prince (made blatant video dancing in front kids on playground, pizza in hand (&quot;ridin round with that pizza&quot;), as well as Dan tallerco(pizza journalist-who made a video talking about dead pizzas in 2012 &quot;pizza obituary, pizza talk episode 5) who did a video on Pizza Brain museum(the kind of pedo place that might have a novelty handkerchief with map of pizza places on it). The pizza brain museum founder uses the phrase &quot;pizza related&quot; in a video. 
Clearly this a simulation started in 2012, which was purposely leaked to us through wikileaks. The shills are still wrong, since the pizza talkers since 2012, are part of an organized psyop effort, involving children (caris cummings) in a government psyop, which is child abuse.</p>

            Could it not be a little from column A and a little from column B? A conspiracy of sex slaves and pedophilia as well as an anti conspiracy that through the keyword of pizza is attempting to unravel it?

            It's possible that it's a psyop, but it's also possible that this is just the way they have been operating and the symbols they have been using for years. At this point of being awake and seeing how we have been lied to, I tend to question absolutely everything!

            Could we be getting distracted by this, and not noticing other cases? Are there bigger players involved? Should we be looking at all the cases that are being brought to light? The answer is, yes. Any normal, mentally sound individual that is presented the evidence with Pizzagate, should be screaming for an investigation. I truly believe some of the people in this circle are going to be outed. Not all, but some. That's my 2 cents, and I am sticking to it.

            Did anyone archive the site with this image before it was taken down?
           </p>
           <p>
            Otherwise, how am I to know this pic isn't shopped somehow?
           </p>
           <p>
            If just that image exists without text, for instance, it would be another example of them flaunting their BS in the open again, rather than evidence of a psyop.
