<p>If you\'ve read my previous <em>BREAKING</em> post on Anthony\'s Pizza in Orlando, FL <a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1495810">here</a> then you know my methodology of how I link other restaurants/businesses in Pizzagate. I strictly follow users who have all been linked to that dumb #killroom photo in some form or another and have simply follow people connected to them. </p>
<p>Anyways, on Anthony\'s Facebook page they have this photo of a weird Lion King drawing of the scene where Rafiki holds up Simba (remember Simba was an infant at that point in the movie), but instead of Simba, it\'s a Pizza: <a href="https://archive.is/SXRik">https://archive.is/SXRik</a> </p>
<p>This is a photo imo that fits the fact pattern of Jimmy Comet and their pedo followers. It\'s a child\'s movie or cartoon (such as Pokemon and Simpson references), that we continually see over and over at these establishments. You might think it\'s friendly but hold on this is where like in my previous posts it gets stranger. </p>
<p>In the bottom left corner of the photo is the business who drew the sketch in the first place.... &quot;Vinnie\'s Pizzeria&quot;. So I went on ahead following my previous methodology of letting the facts guide me to the next location to investigate and low and behold I Google Vinnie\'s which happens to be a locale in Brooklyn, NY. </p>
<p>There are soooooo many pedo references from Vinnie\'s I honestly don\'t know where to start, but I\'ll put the most important first and start of with their website. If you go to Vinnie\'s website you\'ll notice they have a &quot;Friends of Vinnie\'s&quot; section and it\'s strikingly odd b/c this is a small time venture that MAYBE and I mean MAYBE brings in $1 million in revenue a year (I work in Investment Banking as an Equity Analyst - this is my job)... yet they are listing HBO, NBC, VH1, VICE, Paramount Pictures, and Jimmy Kimmel Live.... most of these are mega multi-million dollar market cap companies and billion dollar in NBC\'s case.... what is a small time joint giving a shout out on their front page to these mega-globally connected companies? Makes 0 sense. </p>
<p>Then here is where it gets disturbing. One of their &quot;Friends&quot; listed is a skull and bones with an all seeing eye and pyramid in the background called &quot;Saint Vitus&quot; (not sure if that\'s spelled right).... This is really disturbing, b/c they are directly linking to an obviously known higher level criminal network such as the Skull and Bones society from Yale where many Presidents of the last 50 years have filtered through. </p>
<p><a href="http://vinniesbrooklyn.com/">http://vinniesbrooklyn.com/</a></p>
<p>Vinnie\'s symbol btw is a Freemason reference, one slice is higher than all the others and a slice is already geometrically shaped like a triangle.</p>
<p>Okay, so onto the really disturbing part. Now if you investigate their instagram photos they have multiple pedo references such as the heart shaped pizza, a hotdog, pokemon, and several Simpson references. </p>
<p>Here is the heart shaped pizza, which is what others have exclaimed is a pedo symbol b/c the outside crust symbolizes touching the child subject inside crust:

<a href="https://archive.is/5hMGP">https://archive.is/5hMGP</a> - image 2</p>
<p>Here is probably the most disturbing one. It\'s a hotdog inside a clear glass jar (symbolizing the trapping of a young boy) and in the background is a picture of Christina Aguilera - this is significant b/c at the time of the song they are reference I believe she was a minor, 16 or 17 years old (someone fact check this)? The title is &quot;If you wanna be with me, baby there\'s a price to pay, I\'m a WEENIE in a bottle, <strong>you gotta rub me the right way</strong>. #TGIF #weenieinabottle&quot;</p>
<p>Here\'s a drawing of President Obama, they have almost all presidents since the 1950s depicted in a photo. It really doesn\'t make that much sense for a NY Pizza joint to draw photos of countless presidents b/c it\'s not a highly political area like DC:</p>
<p><a href="https://archive.is/068D3">https://archive.is/068D3</a></p>
<p>A user named picturesofthingsidonteat wrote &quot;I\'m glad you didn\'t go with weenie in a butthole&quot;... could be innocuous or not but the disturbing part is obviously the photo of a hotdog which has been the underpinning of the entire pizzagate thus far.</p>
<p>In relation to everything and the potential for pedo happening on a mass scale they post a photo called &quot;Pizza Pills&quot; and the side effects are the disturbing part.... &quot;Side Effects May Include: Night crying, sagging knees, squeaky (sic) teeth, uncontrollable squat thrusts, vibrating elbows, and arousal&quot; .... uncontrollable squat thrusts?!?! squeaky teeth - remember the Epstein Pedo ring included a full sized dental chair on his pedo island mansion... and the last one arousal? How does any of this relate to an innocent marketing scheme to bring people to your restaurant... it\'s just strange and creepy. 
<a href="https://archive.is/FVpSJ">https://archive.is/FVpSJ</a></p>
<p>This photo is of a human-sized rat trap with pizza underneath... the box is obviously just big enough to trap a child:

<p><a href="https://archive.is/0OpzH">https://archive.is/0OpzH</a></p>
<p>Here of course is THE original link between Anthony\'s and Vinnie\'s:</p>

<p>Reference to pokemon: (there are many more)

<p>Reference to Simpsons: (many more of these as well)
<a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/BC5qnh8guWH/">https://www.instagram.com/p/BC5qnh8guWH/</a> - this one is also a reference to Daddy Bush
<a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/BNdOTSdD37s/">https://www.instagram.com/p/BNdOTSdD37s/</a> - Bart Simpson
<a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/BMUv4_hDKxF/">https://www.instagram.com/p/BMUv4_hDKxF/</a> -A simpson character with a &quot;Jamaican meat patty&quot; (not sure if that is codeword for something)</p>
<p>And this one is highly peculiar Simpsons reference from a user named emilyburrito that commented on one of Vinnie\'s photos, the quote in the picture is &quot;Won\'t somebody please think of the children?&quot; then she comments on the photo and says &quot;Please&quot; :
<a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/BLeTH-xDwnL/">https://www.instagram.com/p/BLeTH-xDwnL/</a></p>
<p>References to Presidents:

<a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/BC5qnh8guWH/">https://www.instagram.com/p/BC5qnh8guWH/</a> - Daddy Bush</p>
<p>Are they trying to say all these presidents go to Vinnie\'s and Vinnie\'s is paying homage? </p>
<p>And then this bizarre and random reference to Beyonce who is a known satanic shill. If you\'re not familiar with Beyonce and Jay-Z\'s blatantly open Freemason references please google and youtube them b/c they don\'t even try to hide it in their videos. Jay-Z is found to have been wearing Aleister Crowley shirts and all seeing eye clothing:</p>

            Not sure if the pictures are identical, but here's their tumbler:

            I don't like this, I think it's dodgy. i don't think the presidents thing is weird at all, I think it seems like a funny marketing type thing. They might have some weird stuff and they might be related, but I think it's not worth posting about anything like this unless you have something concrete that links directly with one of the high profile politicians/political insiders. Otherwise you are running the risk of being horrible to potentially innocent people who've done nothing wrong, and you also make it more likely that this platform on Voat will get banned, and that fewer people will realise that the pedophile connections are actually real and there. Because a lot of these links are kind of tenuous and the pictures aren't as weird or damning as Comet pizza's pictures with actual children in them.
           </p>
           <p>
            In fact, when I read this I thought you might be a CTR zombie, sent to stir up trouble and make us all look like we're crazy trying to find meaning in any and everything to do with pizza and/or hotdogs and that we're dangerous in that we're exposing ordinary everyday people and their small businesses to a vigilante group of pedo-hunters. Apologies if that's not the case, but either way, I think it is best to focus more on the other leads and connections to the Clinton Foundation and known human trafficking hotspots etc, rather than going on a wild goose chase across social media and looking for evidence of anything at all weird or pizza-related. That way lies trouble and it is not a very good research/investigative technique at all.

             I've conceded already and posted that this thread should just be deleted... the hot dog photo is still suspect imo though.

              I'm sorry we pissed on your bonfire! Yeah the stuff is weird, definitely, it's just not weird

              You're obviously good at digging into things and finding stuff, maybe before posting just make sure you have found a connection to one of the major players or that what you've found is so weird and creepy that no one could deny it and say it's just a joke - like the chickenlovers picture or the weird art of kids strung up in a shower room with red buttocks etc. Or you could go to the leads thread linked on the right and pick something to follow up on. It's kind of weird how everyone has to be super careful about what they post and  think first about how it could be distorted in the media by people trying to cover this up and discredit it. But given the stakes, it's definitely better that we're all careful and point out to others if something they've posted could be used in the cover up!

            You're right.... I could definitely be wrong on this.... Vinnie's is definitely a stretch compared to the definite incriminating evidence at CPP but at least we can keep this in our mind in case there is a link further down the road.

            Obviously it's way more than just pedophilia... how do you think they get the children in the first place? Many of them are trafficked and Jimmy Comet has a photo with a baby and 1000s in euros next to it.
           </p>
           <p>
            I'm not derailing anything and for you to make that claim when they have obvious pedo references with the heart shaped pizza and a hotdog has to be at least inspected.
           </p>
           <p>
            No one can deny that this ABC News link with the police sketches of the Maddy McCann's kidnappers are identical to both of the Podesta brothers:
           </p>
           <p>
            <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/International/maddy-mccann-cops-release-sketches-kidnap-suspects/story?id=20563026">
             http://abcnews.go.com/International/maddy-mccann-cops-release-sketches-kidnap-suspects/story?id=20563026
            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            If we can find that the Podestas, Comet, etc (or a money trail) have a link to these places then yes we can make a more conclusive agreement that this place is definitely involved.
           </p>
           <p>
            That's the whole point of me posting about these places connected in some form to the Killroom photo. If you watch Breaking Bad and understand money laundering then you understand that pizza parlors are perfect transactional locations for pedos "art show" parties.... obviously if they were trafficked, that sort of the transaction happened further down the supply chain but like a real life company a product is sold down a supply line and has either value added to it or it is sold off to the end consumer.
           </p>
           <p>
            So from a financial perspective the pizza parlors are the end consumers and that's my whole point in trying to have people research these places. To say I want physical harm to come to Vinnie's is a HYSTERICAL claim to make. I've made no reference that someone should harm them and have only presented evidence for people to make up their minds. I'm obviously not saying they are 100% guilty and I probably should have titled the post "potentially implicated".
           </p>
           <p>
            And two can play this game... perhaps you're the shill b/c you have something to protect. Don't you think 100s if not 1000s of people in DC are saying the exact same cognitive dissonance you just stated? Oh we've been to Comet Ping Pong for a while now, it's only just innocent.
           </p>
           <p>
            Obviously CPP has more damaging evidence to present but this lead should at the very least be investigated further and kept in mind in case there is something that connects it further down the road.

            I appreciate your response Egal but yes a elevated piece of pizza above the others is specifically a Freemason reference.Had they not elevated that one slice at the top they wouldn't be making a reference but the fact they elevated the top piece it is indeed a reference. This has to be taken with the fact they post an image of skull and bones directly on the front page, which is confirming evidence that the symbol of the restaurant is freemason related.... there are virtually no companies you will ever visit in your lifetime that boast a skull and bones on the front page of their website.
           </p>
           <p>
            The hot dog photo imo is WAY too coincidental to be innocent especially considering the title and the comments... c'mon a 16 year old Christina Aguilera with a hot dog inside a bottle with the caption:
           </p>
           <p>
            "If you wanna be with me, baby there's a price to pay, I'm a WEENIE in a bottle, you gotta rub me the right way. #TGIF #weenieinabottle".

            That's not guerilla marketing... they don't even sell hotdogs. There is 0 correlation to anything related to Vinnie's. And the fact they have a skull and bones directly on their front page is also another Freemason reference.

            This is extremely tangential but 11 days ago I wrote this:

             Yea, I think this article is right on about this whole thing. Also I think one thing that happens with conspiracy theories is that the claims and evidence rarely get MORE specific, instead the evidence remains shallow and simply the scope of it grows. Like if you were investigating a murder you would start to question people and come up with some hypotheses and then start to narrow them down with more evidence to figure out actually what happened. Instead with conspiracies the evidence rarely gets more specific it just leads to things that aren't related to it.
            </p>
            <p>
             Like how this started about pedophilia among the DNC people. And then Marina Abramovic was mentioned so satanism was thrown in, and then people started looking into the pizza place and coming up with stuff about Alefantis, and then people started looking into the places AROUND the pizzeria. Also the number of people complicit in this is growing exponentially. At first it would have to be all the DNC people that were in those email lists, and now it's grown to basically all of the MSM has to be complicit and the cops and pretty much that whole block where the pizza place is.

             I agree with you on this post. I just wrote this in fact:
            </p>
            <blockquote>
             <p>
              I don't like this, I think it's dodgy. i don't think the presidents thing is weird at all, I think it seems like a funny marketing type thing. They might have some weird stuff and they might be related, but I think it's not worth posting about anything like this unless you have something concrete that links directly with one of the high profile politicians/political insiders. Otherwise you are running the risk of being horrible to potentially innocent people who've done nothing wrong, and you also make it more likely that this platform on Voat will get banned, and that fewer people will realise that the pedophile connections are actually real and there. Because a lot of these links are kind of tenuous and the pictures aren't as weird or damning as Comet pizza's pictures with actual children in them.
             </p>
             <p>
              In fact, when I read this I thought you might be a CTR zombie, sent to stir up trouble and make us all look like we're crazy trying to find meaning in any and everything to do with pizza and/or hotdogs and that we're dangerous in that we're exposing ordinary everyday people and their small businesses to a vigilante group of pedo-hunters. Apologies if that's not the case, but either way, I think it is best to focus more on the other leads and connections to the Clinton Foundation and known human trafficking hotspots etc, rather than going on a wild goose chase across social media and looking for evidence of anything at all weird or pizza-related. That way lies trouble and it is not a very good research/investigative technique at all.
             </p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>
             But that is this one post. It definitely goes deeper and gets more specific with the people following the substantial leads. But I think you know that. I don't understand why you are here, reading all of this stuff if you are so sure that it's not true, commenting on everything to say that this is just like any other crazy conspiracy theory where people fit the facts to the story rather than seeing what story emerges from the facts - yet whenever you are challenged on that notion and given specific examples and arguments that show you're wrong, you don't respond. Because t's actually YOU who's trying to fit facts around a false narrative, only cherry picking one or two points to try to make your case while ignoring everything else. You're the crazy conspiracy theorist in this instance, with your theory that people investigating this pedophile/child trafficking ring are all just wrong and delusional. You started with that premise and you're holding onto it no matter what.

              My main point that you'll see if you look through my comment history is: do not throw around these serious accusations as if they were nothing, if you see something you feel is suspicious call it that and leave it at that.  I'm just doing my part to help this thing not become a witch hunt.  Which your post is definitely much appreciated.

              This stings a little seeing how I wrote you an almost 1,500 word response yesterday.   haha, you may not have seen since it was a little too long after the post was first posted.  But it won't go to waste, I'll probably make a standalone post out of it.

              I have other reasons for why I do this but I'd rather not get anymore specific.  I just happen to be one of the only people on here with a critical view of this thing so I feel a certain burden.

              <p>
               I agree that it's important to keep a critical eye, because there are lots of great people wanting to help but who aren't experienced with research and evidence and what you can and can't draw conclusions from, etc. And because it's such an important topic and so important not to get it wrong and give any reason for people to dismiss the whole thing, it's really important to have people pointing out when things aren't right or are overreaching etc.
              </p>
              <p>
               I do think though that at a certain point, you can have too many coincidences and connections for it to be random chance. I've been following along quite closely and can see that it's not a case of people casting around for anything that will substantiate the narrative and ignoring everything that refutes it. I've never seen any co-called 'crazy conspiracy theory' that developed this way or had so much historical precedent, so much media censorship etc. I mean the '9/11 truth movement' never got shut down this hard and fast, and you'd think they'd want to prevent that 'fake news' getting out there too.
              </p>
              <p>
               Anyway, sorry for being grumpy at you, you're right it's good to have a critical eye and to watch out for anything that might go awry. I just find it so hard to understand how you can be here and presumably have looked through all the findings, and still think there's nothing to it! Unless you're just playing Devil's Advocate? (Possibly literally, in this case? :-p)

             I'm wondering if greater specificity doesn't also come with less anonymity, and becomes dangerous. The only reason we can speculate about anything is because of our numbers and our anonymity. But to do research of more depth, I imagine it requires talking to people face to face, or putting your personal information out there.

              No i was not... I actually at first didn't believe Pizzagate... I jumped the fence so to say a few days ago when I decided to actually research it... which is why I have been a member for only 1 day so far here. I just learned about VOAT yesterday.
             </p>
             <p>
              I've been posting on other sites but it felt as if those threads had gone stale and the most active place is here.
             </p>
             <p>
              And I felt that we have a higher degree of safety versus people on Youtube who are posting videos of their face and voice. I think we're fine... the people they really care about are someone like Sean Hannity who can spread it to the millions and millions with a simple episode.
             </p>
             <p>
              It's why Andrew Breitbart was murdered imo... he originally posted about pedophilia and Podesta in like 2006 or something. There is a link if you google it. Breitbart WAS the ORIGINAL truther on exposing the Pedo ring.

               No doubt you're right, and welcome to this depressing side of the fence. Having been on this ride for a while, I've never felt more like Neo seeing the desert of the real world; ie - losing all faith in the institutions of government and "journalism." It's been surreal to watch enormous organizations respond to a community of people online simply asking questions. Calling it "news" even. Just surreal.
              </p>
              <p>
               Anyway, to your point. I think another reason the conspiracy broadens is because part of the research needed to tie any specific person to human trafficking requires research into human trafficking. That is hard research to do. When the Alefantis instagram pics were exposed at the same time as exposure was being given for The Franklin Coverup or Cathy O'Brian's accounts (true or not), and Kim Noble's art (which is not connected to pizzagate besides in the context of sex crimes against children) I found myself in tears. I'll read the research of those doing gods work, but I'm not digging into child trafficking more than I need to to understand how it connects to powerful institutions and people in society. No, honestly, hardly even that much. I'm not proud.

             Or this really is a broad conspiracy,  some would say THE conspiracy.  it also doesnt necessarily follow that because its not a small time "this guy did this to so and so" that its just a fantasization. Some things are genuinely big and have a wide scope.

            ZZ, I appreciate the response and generally agree that if an investigation isn't focused it will lose touch with the end goals. However, I am doing what I can with my expertise. My expertise is Finance and analytical work and I know that if I develop as many connections as we can and link them then we have a critical mass potential of implicating those hidden from plain sight no matter how small the lead may seem at first.
           </p>
           <p>
            A police investigator's first duty is after all to cast its net wide at first and then narrow down from their when it has the most relevant information at hand. Statistically speaking, we need to increase the sample size and most importantly the "signal" and not the noise. My theory and methodology is linking everything to "Ground Zero" the #killroom photo. Obviously there will be dead ends and truly innocent people linked to that photo if you understand exponential growth scenarios but that's why I'm using the most incriminating evidence, in order to decrease the probability of following false positives or what we would call a Type 1 error in statistics.
           </p>
           <p>
            The killrom photo is unequivocally the most damning evidence of it all. My methodology has been AMAZINGINGLY simple and I've strictly followed it as a Scientist who can reproduce his results in independent and identical trials.
           </p>
           <p>
            Now, as long as we aren't randomly picking at locations and businesses and are making sure the "signal" to noise ratio is high and strong, then we are making strides to uncovering this network.
           </p>
           <p>
            I understand the theory behind FBIAnon's post to research Saudi and Clinton Foundation links but I don't have the tools to really efficiently investigate something of that nature - I would need technology from the NSA or the FBI to do so. I'm sure there are those here that can do this as they are hackers, but I unfortunately do not have those skills.
           </p>
           <p>
            We are all ONE body here trying to defeat the enemy.... each one of us has certain skills and strengths. Some of us are the feet, some others are the hands, and maybe others are the torso. No one part is more important than the other and we work together using our different strengths and abilities to function properly.
