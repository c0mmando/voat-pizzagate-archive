            unfortunately the whole psychosphere of western civilization is trying to hypersexualise children before their time

            you need something concrete on this guy, though, ultimately. You need to have a chat about molestation with your neice - keep it in the general sense , make sure she knows shes not in trouble, and ask her if anyone has tried to 'be naughty' with her

            Hi, thanks for contributing - you seem a little shaken. I guess no-ones responded because we're not clear how this relates to child trafficking or paedophilia.
           </p>
           <p>
            The links you have provided show this Spitzer guy to be anti-transparency and a thug - but there's no claim or evidence implicating him in paedophilia - you mentioned, perhaps, some neglect in the care of kids, but that doesnt quite get it over the line. Do you have anything more specific?
           </p>
