<p>Deborah Colton, Carolyn Farb, and Lester Marks of the Colton &amp; Farb Gallery had a rare opportunity to host Exit Art, a critically acclaimed New York non-profit art institution, for an exhibition and benefit on January 6th, from 6-8pm.  The exhibit ran through January 16, and was a collection of amazing portfolios mixing today’s preeminent artists with emerging artists.  The portfolios were collected by major institutions including The Museum of Modern Art, Whitney Museum of American Art, and the Metropolitan Museum of Art.  Over the past 30 years Exit Art has become known for cutting edge programs and discovering the next generation of major artists. Some of the artists who generously donate works to the portfolios are <strong>Marina Abramovic</strong>, Donald Baechler, Louise Bourgeois, Sol LeWitt, Julie Mehretu, Yigal Ozeri, Kiki Smith, Nancy Spero, and Carrie Mae Weems to mention a few. </p>
<p>The portfolio covers were designed by Co-founder and Artistic Director of Exit Art, Papo Colo.</p>
<p>A post Gallery celebration was held in the home of Carolyn Farb honoring board members and out of town guests: Board Chair Charles and Naomie Kremer, Co-Founder and Director Jeanette Ingberman, Fairfax Dorn, and <strong>Mark Epstein</strong>.  Those in attendance at the Gallery were CAM Director Bill Arning, Galveston Arts Center’s Clint Willour, Andrew Abendshein and Eloise Frischkkorn, Gallery artists and photographers Jay Rusovich, Nathaniel Donnet, and Michael Meazell. Others in attendance were Reggie and Leigh Smith, Angelica Chapman, Kristy Phillips and Rob Taylor, Chris Kelly, Don Hooper and Rachel Ann Palmer, Jim and Jo Furr, Marthann Masterson and Mike Weaber, Kent Shaffer and Leanna Tran and Terrence Hodby.  An evening of art, philanthropy, and meaningful collaborations was enjoyed by all.  Guests enjoyed the music of Rom Ryan and a menu of Mexican Fare created by Kitty Bailey of Abuso Catering.  The out of towners enjoyed spicy shrimp nachos, Sunshine Margaritas, jack cheese enchiladas, topped off with scrumptious pineapple coconut cake.</p>

            Whitney museum is cabal, the donors/members list is a who's who of the NWO. Carrie Weem does all sort occult theme art, some of her stuff was displayed in lobby of 666 third ave NYC a few months back. Her grandmother was a commie and theosophist and was banging a rothchild back in the day

             It keeps coming around full circle. Even the painter of the Clinton in a Blue Dress worked for Jeff Koons.

             The inter connectivity between these people is the dead give away but it just isn't enough to overcome most people's normalcy bias. Hopefully, with more and more of this hitting the public eye, we can reach some kind of critical mass.

              This full circle applies to what is going on in the Democratic party in terms of the voters. I realized this after hearing a conversations about Epstein. One woman started talking about the alleged suicide .... then drifted into the infamous island which brought up the name Clinton and that jet. No sooner was Billy boy's name out of her mouth then the name "Trump" came up. She said something like, "But Trump flew on that jet, too, so he was more involved than Clinton was because he's president and Clinton isn't anymore." I was like, "Holy shit! This is one big wrap-up smear and indoctrination!" It took a few years, but the fear and panic the Dems have been pushing have taught the Dem sheople that they can't listen to anyone except the authorized "true" channels of news. And this is what the news has been doing. Every time there's a story about Prince Andrew or Clinton or any other perv, they throw in a twenty-year-old picture of our POTUS and somehow implicate him in the story, diverting it away from who the story is about. The Dem sheople read the story, believe it, and repeat it because the paper/media outlet is their authority. They never search any other sources like flight manifests/logs to find out how many times Trump was on the jet (once), and that the plane did not go to Little St. James, it flew to NYC which is what Trump said. Further, there were no girls or other passengers on the flight. On the 27 times Clinton flew TO LITTLE ST. JAMES, there were always young girls on the flights. Always. Nevermind the differing destination. So the sheople never get out of that loop because they it's a full circle or Dem leaders telling the trusted outlets/propagandists what to print, the voters reading/watching those outlets, and the voters then spreading that story to their friends/othersheople. Nothing ever taints the propaganda stream.

              You take the average pizzagater, and we look at multiple sources, including those pesky flight logs, manifests, donations, who attends what parties together, multiple events, who was on whose yacht, where they parties, and so on and so on. I talked to this one Dim one-time (yeah, why?) and asked them if they'd even read the Assange DNC email dump for themselves, and they answered, "That's not my bible." I replied, "That means, no, doesn't it?" You see, they're trained to stay away from that because somehow that's not accredited by their leaders. To a very real sense, they've been groomed.

              Think about it. Way back when, it started with statues. Suddenly these innocuous statues that had been standing for hundreds of years were to be feared and torn down because they threatened our safety. And the ozone ... we didn't know that the sky held this threat to our existence. Then it was Christopher Columbus ... he was an evil maniac monster who was an invader and needed to be eradicated. Then it was school prayer. Who would have thought something God was something to fear, but the Dems told their followers what to fear and they feared it because they were being groomed. The same way Jim Jones groomed, these leaders groomed in identifying these unknown terrors and subversive symbols. The combination of panic, hysteria, and the Dems giving the roadmap of what to do about it have essentially triggered the war against the police, our country, our law officials, supreme court justice nominees, the destruction of our laws and borders, and dissolution of gender and family values including God.

              So, yes, everything is a full circle and that circle needs to be broken.
