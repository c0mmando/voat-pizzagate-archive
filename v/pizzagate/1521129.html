            Dude YOU ASKED for proof that that SAUDI's are SICK BABY fuckers, here is the proof.

            I was going to post the link the first time, but you deleted the post before I could post evidence this time I posted the evidence first, and posted the allegations as a comment.
           </p>
           <p>
            This is the point here no matter what you do, in what order your a criminal according to the mods.
           </p>
           <p>
            Never are you given time, to post a story and follow up with proof, they always delete your post for no reasons nano-seconds after a post is made, then when you follow up they say "Too late", you fucked up first time.

            Info originally from the Anonymous FBI agent who leaked it onto 4Chan where it was copied onto Reddit, before the latter 86'd Pizzagate from it's site. The owner of Reddit is strongly pro-Hillary. Right now ANY reporter who tries to write about anything remotely related to Pizzagate or pedophilia is immediately fired. The article I posted on Norway's 51 high profile pedo arrests disappeared from WA PO the one MSM who carried it. Why?
           </p>
           <p>
            Originally the British Secret Service needed loyal agents. They recruited spies they knew were gay and filmed them in the act. Threatening exposure which was illegal and meant automatic imprisonment and personal disgrace for their entire family guaranteed compliance. Once homosexual behavior was acceptable all of the elite were compromised with young boys and girls found in care homes in group "activities."
           </p>
           <p>
            Excess children the country could not afford to feed and house were sent to Australia. Over 17,500 became slaves of the various church run institutions.
           </p>
           <p>
            A per cent of those without relatives in The Netherlands who were incarcerated were taken "to work" for the Royal Family. Individually they were ritually and sexually abused and then murdered at the rate of about 100 a year. Later the sale of young blood and organs meant the kids were temporarily kept alive after they were sexually abused multiple times in rituals.
           </p>
           <p>
            Saudis favored blond haired blue-eyed kids. Long before the Nazis were secretly brought to the US the CIA had been developing mind control programs to create the perfect assassin or spy that would have no memory of his actions. Please see the movie "The Manchurian Candidate," original version as an example of what Communist China had already accomplished.
           </p>
           <p>
            It was found that children who had suffered extreme trauma from the youngest ages had naturally developed a split personality to be able to survive and function day-to-day. MK ULTRA and LSD were induced to purposely alter young minds to create the perfect, obedient "sex kittens."
           </p>
           <p>
            In 1972 USA was bankrupt. The gold was gone from Fort Knox. Nixon took USA off the GOLD standard. Kissinger idea for Petro-Dollar. Saudi would require world to buy their oil in dollars, SAUDI would use dollar to buy t-bills, and CIA would provide unlimited children for SAUDI elite to fuck,kill, and bleed. Since 1972 the US DOLLAR is not the Petro-Dollar, it is the PEDO-DOLLAR. Saudi used Trillions of Dollars to BUY real estate all over USA, and most of DC. Saudi is tightly aligned with Israel, AIPAC is a foil, it controls WASH-DC, but Saudi MONEY controls AIPAC.

            Why was this deleted? Why not simply ask for sources and enrich the discussion?

            Even if sources had been supplied it would have been deleted. Another MOD would have used another justification.
           </p>
           <p>
            Note that mention or tie of SAUDI to Pizzagate is taboo.
           </p>
           <p>
            Just like SRA ( Satanic Ritual Abuse ) is taboo as it leads to Jewish Occultism.
           </p>
           <p>
            Pizzagate is just a fucking mind-fuck to these mod's, they're just playing a psycho game.
           </p>
           <p>
            Not one thing in this post is new, all is known, and all has been sourced in the past. KingKongwasWrong/Millenial-Falcon, just create new naive mod's who don't know this shit was sourced, play dumb, ask for sources; delete and repeat.; Shill posts by friends of MODS exempt from game.
