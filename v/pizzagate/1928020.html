OANN has a $100K reward for finding his killer and IS NOT backing away from trying to get to the truth of this story. I still cannot find the actual video posted online, so anyone who could find/post a link, please do...and I will edit this post. Some of the most important items raised in the story are:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>If this were a botched robbery, why was nothing (wallet with lots of cash, smartphone, expensive watch/jewelry) not stolen? What evidence at all exists of a robbery?,Why did the police not interview staff at Lou’s City Bar (where Rich was last seen alive)?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What did Seth Rich do from the time he left the bar at about 1:45 am until he was killed at about 4:20 am?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What happened to the video from Flagler Market, that would have captured the events with its four cameras given that the shooting occurred across the street and well in view of its security cameras? The parents mention the video in an interview and that it was supposedly collected, so why have the police not released it asking for help in finding the killers?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What of the other many cameras posted in the Bloomingdale neighborhood which could have captured evidence related to the crime as the perpetrators entered and exited the neighborhood?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What happened to the body cam footage on at least three responding officers? It shows in the police report but somehow cannot be produced?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Why was no DNA evidence collected given that he had bruising to his hands, face, and knees, which would likely have transferred DNA from the attacker(s) given the apparent scuffle.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What happened to Seth Rich\'s laptop? Apparently, it could provide evidence of a connection to WikiLeaks through Gavin McFadden. Statements by Julian Assange of Wikileaks and Kim DotCom both strongly support the idea that he was the Wikileaks source of the DNC emails. Why has no one asked John Podesta meant when he wrote, &quot;I\'m definitely for making an example of a suspected leaker&quot; in one of his emails?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Why are they not releasing the autopsy report for Seth Rich? How did he die?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Why does a 4th-year surgery resident who works at Washington Hospital Center (MedStar) claim that he was told not to visit Seth Rich on his rounds while he was surrounded by LEO? This resident claimed that the wounds did not appear life threatening (lower back).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Why is any inquiry into his death viewed as a conspiracy theory and not an effort to get information that could lead to his killers? Why is all evidence related to his case being suppressed? Why is there an immediate attack by people at the highest levels, including calls for boycotts, against anyone who is looking into this story?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Why did Donna Brazille ask about an investigator snooping around into his death? Why is the DNC opposed to people trying to find who killed one of their staff members? Why no reward offer by the DNC?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Why are all these strange connections of those orbiting Seth Rich\'s death not worth questions being asked and answered? How did a connection of John Podesta, Robert Robinson, end up as one of the first responders to the crime? How did Brad Bauman, deeply connected to the DNC and Hillary, end up as the family spokesperson, with the apparent goal being to stop any citizen investigation? Why did Jack Sava, deeply connected to the Dems and Podesta, call off all other doctors from checking on Rich during their rounds?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What was Seth Rich about to testify about in regards to the HRC emails and election fraud? Was this what caused him to be disgruntled enough to leak the DNC files? Was this the reason he was a potential target for elimination?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Why has the family changed its tone, from asking for public help in finding the killer to trying to discourage any investigation? Given the way this case has been actively suppressed, you would think that the family would question the official story of a botched robbery.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The Seth Rich story has the exact same pattern as pizzagate. Any effort to ask questions and investigate produces a massive flurry of activity to immediately discredit this effort as &quot;fake news&quot; and a conspiracy. There is absolutely NO EVIDENCE to support the public narrative of a botched robbery, nor has there been a single piece of evidence to support the story of Russia hacking the DNC computers. There is massive evidence of a cover-up of the crime and that the DNC files were leaked by an insider, with many related connections that fit the pattern of this explanation. Occam\'s Razor would actually refer to the LSM story about Seth Rich as pure, unsupported speculation and would call for the pursuit of the theory of murder in retaliation for leaking as the most supported case.</p>',

            Thank You for Your Post and Your Questions Are Spot On.  Two things right off.  I believe Seth's Organs Were Harvested and Sava did the Surgery.  That is why the resident was kept away from Seth.  There was a report that someone said his death was actually many hours later, and I believe that is because of the Organ Harvesting and the time the Organ Receiver needed to arrive at MedStar. They had planned on Rich being murdered on that corner, but when they found him still alive, why not take his Organs, never being ones to give up a chance to make a bundle of cash.  Remember when an Anon on 4chan asked us to check JP travel plans?  I wonder if that is because JP might have been flying from somewhere to receive those Organs.  All of this may be the reason the autopsy report has to be kept a secret or maybe one does not even exist.  Who knows.  The camera at Flagler Market was positioned downward.  For what reason and by whom? They say that it only recorded the feet of the attackers.  Hmm.  I want it released NOW.  Will the feet and shoes match the two SEIU Union Members that were killed gangland style in Myrtle Beach the day after Seth was killed?  Let Us See. They have created this Conspiracy Theory by not giving us and the parents any answers and I believe they have put fear into his family as well.  Just think about how the DNC can control the MPD.

              Your welcome.  I have been researching Seth Rich since the day he was murdered.  I am convinced we were really close to solving it.   Let's get back to it.
