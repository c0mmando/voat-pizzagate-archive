<p>Notice she died after pizzagate broke. It may seem like nothing, but it  s unfortunate that she is not available to share her story anymore, nor is she able to provide any more insight into her elite cultural background.</p>

<p>Relevant details at 9:00</p>
<p>Fiona’s account starts at 11:00 minutes.</p>
<p>The bit mentioned by the YouTube, Bettina Arndt, covers a story wherein Fiona related to a national audience, in a documentary broadcast, that she was groomed and raped by an adult family friend when she was 14. Her account clearly shows that here grandmother and mother conspired for here to be given to this man for such a purpose.</p>
<p>That’s pedogate, there. </p>
<p>Her account was given as a rationalization for her being drawn to violent men. Coincidentally, it fails to support the feminist narrative, that men are inherently violent. If so, she wouldn’t have to account for her attraction, because supposedly ALL men have this violence. It fails secondly, because her matriarchs arranged for her to be abused, which indicates that they are collaborators and contributors to such violence. Further, such a relationship falls far outside of any scientific hypothesis that feminists could use to label ALL men as violent.</p>
<p>I admit, the final paragraph there is a tidbit isn’t really in our baileywick, but gives feminists a reason to be happy that Fiona is now silent. For us, I find two things useful:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>There is a clear launching pad to dig for details on Australian elites connected to Fiona Richardson. I’m not finding anything here that’s mentioned her before. Clearly, these people are into sexual exploitation of kids. Maybe there is more to be found.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Without any real research, I would like to postulate that the timing of her death is noteworthy. She could have been offed in any number of ways that wouldn’t attract suspicion. Or maybe I’m wrong.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>There is plenty to read, but I will just tap Wikipedia here:</p>
<p>“On 25 June 2013, it was announced that she had been diagnosed with breast cancer. She went into remission and returned to parliament.
On 7 August 2017, Richardson announced she was taking medical leave from parliament. On 22 August, she said she would be extending her leave after being diagnosed with several tumours and would retire at the next election, but she died the next day, 23 August 2017, aged 50.”</p>

<p>I don’t know if this is of any interest to our Australian friends here. Also, I’m sure that there are many Australians here, but I’m not sure who is who.</p>

            Great video , people don't realize that woman are just as capable of abuse as men .  This woman is doing good work trying to educate people on this matter . Woman are just as evil sometimes .. This system has produced a whole generation of sick evil mothers who were probably abused as well .
