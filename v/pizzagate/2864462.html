            Did i just read that they have a database of "known child abuse material"??
 It sounds like we need to know who is organizing, maintaining and accessing this data.

             Essentially it's how almost any auto-censoring system works; on YouTube, they have a database or template for every copyrighted song, film, music video, series or other major release over the last 50 years or so. If somebody uploads one of these without permission, the algorithm detects the video sequence immediately and compares it to its database. These systems are smart. Even if you change tempo, brightness, speed, they're getting better at copy protection.
            </p>

             Essentially the same is done for CP and has been running for years, since it's too ineffective to rely on manual detection. It's managed by federal agents, presumably international, and likely updated on a daily basis. As a result though, you have a database of
             <em>
              "material"
             </em>
             that's basically an accumulation vault of the worst humanity can do, and I'm sure this bank must've been used to sell, bribe &amp; exploit adults and children before, by however many corrupt agents have access to it. I would guess this system has done more good than bad however, depending on how you measure the virtue of censoring online material.

             Well... Id have to say that it's Tumblr's owner's that are getting the data.
If they are anything like Tweeter..
             <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/09/21/twitter-bug-sent-user-direct-messages-to-developers-for-over-a-year/?guccounter=1">

             </a>
             or the NSA...
             <a href="https://www.govexec.com/technology/2014/07/snowden-nsa-employees-are-passing-around-nude-photos/88954/">

             </a>
             then you're probably going to get a lot of Tumblr Employees grooming a 'misc' folder with personal favourites somewhere..

               I think that the CP and 'potential blackmail material' were just unexpected bonuses.. but perverts being perverts just cant resist dipping in and picking private photos out.. so think about it next time you send a dick pick through Tinder.  Imagine how many 'married' people have sent pictures of their asshole to a complete stranger hoping for a gangbang.. hope no Courthouse jurists have any compromising material on them that could be used to spueeze them to push for a certain verdict.. lets not think about Judges...mein gott they're bad..  Twas all just gravy on an already fattened and butchered turkey getting 13 year old to send videos of themselves masturbating into the internet. . .it's often computer techniciens that have problems with adult females..  too much time watching manga porn and lolipops and 'dark net' porn.. thinking themselves so haxxor that they're using tor servers to 'hide' themselves..  Im sure you've heard of the Internet Dickwad Theory.. Dickwads turn into perverts when they believe themselves to be truely hidden..

               Prospective members were subjected to an online vetting process about their sexual preferences and were required to submit 10,000 new images as a pre-condition of acceptance. Existing members of the club voted on whether a new candidate should be admitted. Each time they entered the Wonderland channel, users went through seven separate security checks and had to pass two electronic gatekeepers known as Alice and Sandra.

            This is disgusting.  I don't use any of the soc. media sites talked about lately.  No Twitter, FB, Snapchat, or any other.  The fact that these horrid things are slipping through, well, i think there has to be a way this can be avoided.  Possibly these things are easily allowed is to keep the sickos from not unsubscribing.  This site should be banned IMMediately.  These sites are up to no good, imo.  Always a whimpy excuse.

             Tumblr changed to a membership based model a few years ago.
            </p>
            <p>
             (Ie: you have to have an account to view most blogs) This has led to Tumblr transitioning from a legit blogging platform to the Instagram of Porn.

              All of soc. media has been dragging their feet when it comes to taking down the really scummy porn and child rape and abuse.  They are all trying take in that extra cash before they get found out.  Only then when people demand it will they finally succumb to to the pressure.  Pressure and protest does work.  It just needs to be a lot of people.

               It's up to us to share this info outside of our filter bubbled voat platform. The tough part is, like you, I refuse to use these scummy popular social media platforms.

              <p>
               The Holidays are coming, it's an excellent time to share this info with friends and family.

                Just call. I have in the past and they were very receptive. Be "polite" and give documentation. Then tell them that this is an outrage. Alex Jones never did something like this!

                Since I am older than most of the family except for parents, they all think I know zilch about anything.  They are all have degrees and mostly millennials and genexers.  They think I go to the wrong sites.  Immediately I am questioned.  What site did you see that on Who did you hear that from?  I have been lambasted because I said I was sitting on the fence about Trump after the election.  These people are nuts.  But I love them cause they are family.  I may bring up about the puberty blockers being given to Autistic Children and see how that goes. I already sent that info to a friend who has Grand Children.   Yes, I agree we are the solution.  We are the Journalists of Today.

                 Personally, I think it's too late to turn this ship of fools around. It is time to reap what we have sown and it is a BUMPER CROP!

                 Its hard to wake people up. Especially family. And especially the mis(educated)
                </p>
                <p>
                 Might I suggest printing out news articles and bringing a binder of evidence? It may seem like overkill, but then you dont have to argue, you just point to the Mainstream Media.
                </p>
                <p>
                 I also suggest keeping these discussions apolitical and simply point out the instances of child abuse/pedophilia that we have archived, without addressing the greater political structure facilitating it.

                 Good luck :) it's okay to be percieved as the "crazy aunt" or "uncle". Even if they refuse to see it, we are still planting seeds which may someday sprout

                  Oh I dare not bring up politics.  Yes, I have thought of articles.  Whip one out and say Oh I just happen to have this. I don't bring up anything that might sway the subject towards politics.  I get pummeled.  They all thought I was wonderful when I agreed with their politics, now that I am questioning things and using my brain, different story.  I hope to make this a quiet Thanksgiving.
