<p>So i start looking around for more info and <a href="http://poundpuplegacy.org/node/14974?sort=asc&amp;order=Document">found this page</a> including tons of sources at the bottom regarding the case.</p>
<p>(If there wasn\'t an existing archive page for any of these links i made one today)</p>
<p>Then i see the adoptive mother in this case apparently has changed names many times <a href="http://www.dailybastardette.com/masha-allen-update-masha-sues-adoption-agencies-social-worker-jeannene-smith/">according to this report</a>.</p>
<p><a href="http://poundpuplegacy.org/node/45552">Here are links</a> to the adoptive mothers\' - Faith Allen - petition for name change and her previous addresses etc. </p>
<p>Here is a <a href="https://www.wikileaks.org/wiki/Masha_Allen_child_pornography_case:_Pennsylvania_v_Charles_Nathaniel_Brown_transcript">transcript</a> of one of the legal hearings that discusses Faith Allens &quot;disturbing background&quot;, i have yet to read that but i saw on other sources she &quot;escaped&quot; from a satanic cult.</p>
<p>There is so much to go over and angles to pursue here. There are the lawyers, adoption agencies, judges, cross referencing Faiths addresses with anything other newsworthy events, etc. I\'m not that great at this like a lot of you guys but will work on this one if anyone can help that would be appreciated, i just wanted to put this out there now and update as i go so i don\'t lose track of it and have a jumble of data that confuses me the deeper i get lol</p>
<p>Scanning her name change petition, i came across a previous address in Wexford, PA. This is not enough to be considered a pattern but a side project I\'ve been working on has been trying to identify &quot;elite hunting grounds&quot; by searching missing people in clusters concentrated around private rich hunting preserves in every country and if they have a castle on the property, a bonus. Found one that spiked my instincts in Wexford County, UK. (The only reason i bring this up is because i look for name patterns, seeing how you guys have pointed out how these pedos- words, names and places have a meaning that bypasses normal people who &quot;aren\'t in the know&quot;). </p>
<p>Don\'t want to throw too many angles out but want to put my thoughts down before i lose track of them working on other stuff.  Of course i could find all the missing kids i want around hunting preserves or national parks but unless the police are willing to comb through with cadaver dogs or an eyewitness shows up, will be hard to prove but i just wanted the knowledge for myself in the event society breaks down people can go overtake these properties themselves and check.</p>',

            So right now i'm narrowing research to find connections with this to the main players, however many degrees of separation i have to dig or else the satanic angle and see how that connects to anyone. Also seeing stuff right now she received an elementary education degree at Columbia? She kept changing names so makes it trickier, also found another source that she may have moved to atlanta but saw the link to her current facebook [Psalm Ginn]. Following these right now.
           </p>
           <p>
            Main priorities are to either connect her to the larger network and also see where she is potentially victimizing anyone now. Locals can either surveil or notify the community (if she is working with kids under another name).
