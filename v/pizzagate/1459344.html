This is also about Julian assange but ties in to it all.
I may gone full autist on this one.</p>
<p>so we have this - <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_sbT3_9dJY4&amp;t=110s">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_sbT3_9dJY4&amp;t=110s</a>
which has obvious signs of editing at many different time intervals 
which i\'m not going in to.</p>
<p>and given this - <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNaiZcUZXus">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNaiZcUZXus</a>
which i double checked some of and is obviously why people think Julian assange is dead.</p>
<p>now back on the first video. throughout it, nobody i\'ve seen mention it yet
but it says &quot;courtesy: dartmouth films&quot; across the bottom area.
Now i don\'t know if a separate film company to RT always does their interviews but filming 
that seemed weird to me. 
If that is normal someone correct me and I\'ll go back to sleep.</p>
<p>Anyway, on the site at their &quot;team&quot; the owner 
is someone called Christopher Hird. Can\'t find a wiki on him or nothing but did get this
<a href="https://uk.linkedin.com/in/christopher-hird-3765a37">https://uk.linkedin.com/in/christopher-hird-3765a37</a></p>
<p>There is also a few newspaper interviews with the guy which didn\'t reveal too much
but in 2013 on the linkedin it says he started <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One_World_Media">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One_World_Media</a></p>
<p>Now, that is a weird titled media company and very nwo-sounding. Channel 4 presenter Jon Snow
presents their award ceremony. </p>
<p>Here\'s what doesn\'t make sense to me. If JA is dead from before that interview why would RT 
(owned by rus gov) be complicit on doing a fake edited interview using a uk company, when they are 
no doubt big fans of him????</p>
<p>In my mind, that only leaves 2 possibilities really. 1 - That\'s not really RT/they are somehow 
compromised (unlikely) or 2 - something bigger is at play, e.g. rus gov knows he\'s dead and 
made some kind of deal maybe because trump won anyway? so they will all just drop the whole 
pizzagate thing. Remember Trump has already confirmed post-election 
he will not actually go after hillary (although that could be because of his own link
to Epstein). 
This is very important to all things pizzagate because he was going to leak a ton more stuff.
Proof being his internet gets severed a day after tweeting pre-commitment encryption codes.
Just my 2 cents...hopefully we just get an obvious answer soon</p>',
