<p>Staff were initially called for a first meeting this morning, where it was hoped they would be briefed on the announcement. But the meeting was instead about the Queen spending more time at Windsor Castle, as revealed by Daily Star Online in the summer.</p>
<p>A second one was then called, which our source told us was &quot;unbelievable as we have never had two big meetings in one day&quot;.</p>
<p>They are set to release a statement from Kensington Palace later on, but if it is not released today it will be on Monday,&quot; our source initially told us.</p>
<p>“I think the announcement will be about Harry and Meghan’s engagement, but we will have to wait and see.”</p>
<p>Kensington Palace declined to comment when approached by Daily Star Online.
The last time the Queen\'s household call staff in for such a large meeting it announced Prince Philip, the Duke of Edinburgh, was stepping down from Royal duties.</p>

            RECently saw a documentary about royals and this was mentioned:

            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Groom_of_the_Stool">

            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            It wad hinted that the position still exists. The royal toilet paper applicator probably has some interesting stories to tell. It is crazy to think about a room in the basement full of aging jars of royal turds...

            Marines raid CIA HQ and seize all kinds of evidence.

              If there is something, why is nothing happening? Where’s the Emergency Broadcast System announcement? Where’s Trump using Obama’s emergency television override to speak to the people? Where’s the martial law? Where are the riots he talked about? Antifa couldn’t even get off their asses for a completely unrelated outing. Where’s the Huma arrest? Where are the Podesta arrests? They were supposed to be in custody by now; no one has any information on that beyond your continued shilling campaign. Why is he a CIVIC NATIONALIST? Nothing he said has happened.

               Have you ever thought that the real threat Pres Trump would not hesitate to send out The National Guard to stop the destruction of property and to arrest any possible agitators convinced many to just stay away?
              </p>
              <p>
               Others lost their motivation to join the small protests when they learned Soros had reneged on his stated promise to handle the legal fees of those arrested as well as related expenses.  Instead Soros paid thousands of dollars for a full page ad in the NY Times listing the planned locations of the protests and the now reduced times. Personally I believe his organization was quietly billed for extra police security and local city clean-up.
              </p>
              <p>
               Word was spread through the alt.right community to please avoid any possible confrontation with ANTIFA and to let LE quickly handle any possible rioters. When word spread among the alt.right community that Pres Trump would not stand for any disruption  of transportation routes people followed the request.
              </p>
              <p>
               Still those in the know called out the preparations of their local military bases in anticipation of potential problems. All leave was cancelled at multiple locations. So WHY use the EBS if it's not absolutely needed? To scare the public unnecessarily?

               Both Podesta brothers have been arrested. Their deal as widely stated all over Twitter was for no media coverage. Hillary, Chelsea, and McCain have been seen in public wearing ugly boots that are clearly not "a fashion statement." Their lame excuses of injuries as justification has been ridiculed all over the internet from the elderly who actually suffer from their claimed medical problems.

               Have you actually seen Huma and Obama in public as frequently? Would the latter still be following Trump around to various countries like Japan and China? He was before his arrest. Huma has always tried to keep an extremely low profile on most occasions. Note her generally tasteful, professional, but very unobtrusive style of dress. She's now essentially the sole parent of a young son.

               I can see that your issue is the exact same as my former FB associates. "If it's not in the MSM then it's just not true," is the frequent response to my attempts to inform them to seek out multiple sources of info via Tweets and multiple YouTube video hosts. While not 100% of what each says will be completely accurate, as everyone must hypothesize what's going on as anything officially stated is always a little suspect, if you keep up with multiple sources  of online info IMHO you'll be way, way ahead.

                And yet none of those elderly can actually know anything about what has happened to them. That’s not evidence. Testimony holds the LEAST weight of anything presentable in court. I know how “convenient” it sounds to say, “McCain’s brain surgery was fake so he can say ‘i can’t remember’ on the witness stand!” but fantasies aren’t reality. You redditors don’t seem to grasp that.

A cuckchan LARPer who doesn’t even know how to use a tripcode is not one of the ONLY TEN PEOPLE IN THE FUCKING WORLD with a specific level of security clearance and “full knowledge of this plan.” Someone that important is not posting on 4chan. Someone that important–if he actually has knowledge he wants to disseminate–is also not going to type cryptic bullshit that looks like it came from more than two people and ask questions that he doesn’t answer. Someone that important is, statistically, owned by jews, even if there are some patriots left up there. Out of 10 of the most powerful people in the entire fucking world, the redditors on 4chan expect one of them to not only be “#ourguy”, but to leak the proceedings of FUCKING NATIONWIDE MARTIAL LAW and–surprise surprise–the arrest of three quarters of the US government.

               Is this another one of your faggot profiles? How did you manage to get comment contribution points? If not, then you guys will make great friends/lovers. You're both obsessed with Jews and hate women.

                Nothing is happening. Nothing was ever going to happen. A cuckchan LARPer who doesn’t even know how to use a tripcode is not one of the ONLY TEN PEOPLE IN THE FUCKING WORLD with a specific level of security clearance and “full knowledge of this plan.” Someone that important is not posting on 4chan. Someone that important–if he actually has knowledge he wants to disseminate–is also not going to type cryptic bullshit that looks like it came from more than two people and ask questions that he doesn’t answer. Someone that important is, statistically, owned by jews, even if there are some patriots left up there. Out of 10 of the most powerful people in the entire fucking world, the redditors on 4chan expect one of them to not only be “#ourguy”, but to leak the proceedings of FUCKING NATIONWIDE MARTIAL LAW and–surprise surprise–the arrest of three quarters of the US government.

                Why, that’s exactly what we would want! Happy day! All of our dreams are coming true, and we didn’t even have to put in an ounce of work ourselves! Hooray! It’s over! We’re saved! DON’T QUESTION IT, just spend the entire day ignoring literally everything else that is ACTUALLY happening in the news, never mind your own wildly successful campaign of “It’s okay to be white.” Because nothing ever came from YOU doing an honest day’s work!

Where’s the martial law? Where are the riots he talked about? Antifa couldn’t even get off their asses for a completely unrelated outing. Where’s the Huma arrest? Where are the Podesta arrests? They were supposed to be in custody by now; no one has any information on that beyond your continued shilling campaign. Why is he a CIVIC NATIONALIST? Nothing he said has happened.

                Nothing is happening. Nothing was ever going to happen. A cuckchan LARPer who doesn’t even know how to use a tripcode is not one of the ONLY TEN PEOPLE IN THE FUCKING WORLD with a specific level of security clearance and “full knowledge of this plan.” Someone that important is not posting on 4chan. Someone that important–if he actually has knowledge he wants to disseminate–is also not going to type cryptic bullshit that looks like it came from more than two people and ask questions that he doesn’t answer. Someone that important is, statistically, owned by jews, even if there are some patriots left up there. Out of 10 of the most powerful people in the entire fucking world, the redditors on 4chan expect one of them to not only be “#ourguy”, but to leak the proceedings of FUCKING NATIONWIDE MARTIAL LAW and–surprise surprise–the arrest of three quarters of the US government.

                Why, that’s exactly what we would want! Happy day! All of our dreams are coming true, and we didn’t even have to put in an ounce of work ourselves! Hooray! It’s over! We’re saved! DON’T QUESTION IT, just spend the entire day ignoring literally everything else that is ACTUALLY happening in the news, never mind your own wildly successful campaign of “It’s okay to be white.” Because nothing ever came from YOU doing an honest day’s work!

Where’s the martial law? Where are the riots he talked about? Antifa couldn’t even get off their asses for a completely unrelated outing. Where’s the Huma arrest? Where are the Podesta arrests? They were supposed to be in custody by now; no one has any information on that beyond your continued shilling campaign. Why is he a CIVIC NATIONALIST? Nothing he said has happened.

                 Going thru your comments on your profile was a joy. I bet you make your parents proud. EVERY comment I see is from you is you being a dick. You repeat yourself a lot too. Do you live in your parents basement and spit out hate online because you're a little coward in real life? It takes a big man to copy and paste. Do you have NO life? I don't see what you think you are accomplishing here. Why don't you stick with the politics sub and stop following me around like a fricken weirdo? I got your point. You think QAnon is a LARP. Move along now. You're annoying. At least Donkey is a funny and entertaining nutcase. You're just WEIRD.

             Was not on 4Chan when the situation with Lisa Ling went down. Was it ever determined on GOAT
 which side Ling was on? Months earlier she had gone to NK with an optometrist/specialist, his assistant and translator to record patients being able to now see for the very 1st time in their lives.
            </p>
            <p>
             By the way a good friend of my boyfriend regularly makes trips to NK to volunteer his medical services. He's a retired doctor and has been able to relay much important and accurate info to US authorities.

             Yes! I've been looking all this up and was thinking about making a post. You should make a separate post with all of these leads. You can add this. I got it from 4chan.

             Are you aware that more pimps and child traffickers have been arrested in the several months Trump's been president than the previous number of years? It's going to require a major clean-up of many large city police departments starting with DC and all those in Los Angeles County. Changing the climate by which serial perps feel they can do anything they please to whomever is being corrected.
            </p>
            <p>
             In addition there's a new court date for master perp and child trafficker Jeffrey Epstein. Under the last few administrations a published writer who wrote a detailed biography and expose was completely shut down by her previous publishers. While very sympathetic they were made well aware of the repercussions if they took the more moral route. In addition they warned the author serious threats were made on her life as well.
            </p>
            <p>
             Yes I wish Pres Trump could make the system work even faster. With Hillary under arrest the major national and international trafficker of children has been at least thwarted. Now what will be done to all of the members of the "Sisters of Evil?"

             What do you think Dennis Rodman was doing in NK when Obama was POTUS? Simply discussing Kim Jong-un's fondness of basketball and US action movies like . . . James Bond's "Goldfinger? You don't realize Rodman is a CIA asset? I'll make you a bet Lisa Ling is as well.

            LISA Ling and her girlfriend weren't investigating human trafficking. They are the human traffickers. They are to NK what Laura Silsby is to Haiti. They send in women to do the transporting of orphans (less suspicious) and when they get caught they extract them. THEY WERE NOT REPORTERS!! That's a fucking cover story. Who wants to make a bet ? LISA Ling and her gf are CIA assets imbedded in media as part of OP mockingbird. Why would get special treatment from Hill-Billy? Bc they're CIA assets. Human trafficking occurs in third world countries where birth certificates are lost and or not issued.

            BILL or Podesta = their handler and they are the traffickers.

             That's all wild speculation. They intentionally crossed into NK without a visa and as Americans and journalists that is a serious offense. Why was Bill Clinton there? NK was named on the axis of evil and as a result no US government officials could be seen going there.
            </p>
            <p>
             Bill Clinton was sent there in an "unofficial" capacity to negotiate the terms for the light water reactor. Two days after Bill Clinton left NK, I was on a plane from Beijing to Pyongyang with about five reps from the UN to discuss the light water reactor.
            </p>
            <p>
             The border between Nk and China is porous and it is possible for citizens to defect. The claims of Lisa Ling trafficking NK children is laughable.

              Hasn't China been sending back almost all defectors especially if they're male? Young women are needed to be wives (and slaves essentially) of China's poor farmers as the country has an uneven balance of the sexes.

             What do you mean? Lisa Ling AND her sister Laura Ling are CIA assets imbedded in media as part of operation mockingbird? I've never felt that way about Lisa Ling. I remember that she was really close to her sister Laura and was an emotion wreck. Are you sure about this? Or is it your opinion?

               Because Lisa Ling seems really legit. I saw an interview before of her talking about what happened to her sister. She seemed really genuine and heart broken. I don't see them being CIA. I think their real journalists. I want to see proof.

               Yes! It was an attachment in one of Podesta's emails! What's weird to me, is that Podesta was supposed to be on vacation, so it was a surprise that he ended up in N Korea when those ladies in the picture were freed. Why would he have their picture in his emails and have the need to leave vacation to go with Clinton when those women were released? That seems fishy.

              In the Podesta emails there's one from them with the little korean orphan eating pizza in a picture. Based on everything I'd say this guy is on the right track. HRC goes to rescue Silsby WJC went to rescue those two.

            Maybe they offed someone important and need to get their story straight. Maybe Liz is ill and contemplating releasing something about PG or corruption before she dies. Maybe it's about putting her gross face on some new money like how they re-vamped the pound coin. I have too many questions, I guess all I can do is sleep on it.

             People are debating if and when Prince Charles will become king. Expect a more official announcement that Prince Philip is too ill to continue much of his formal public appearances and duties.

             Rumors are at this point Prince William does not want to be king, although I'm sure his mother-in-law has the opposite point of view.

             It's from the same event when Podesta emailed a picture of a woman and a child eating pizza and said there's nothing better than this. The woman was one of the women that North Korea released, and I assume the kid was a relative. Mission successful, he was glad about getting them out. If we ever found anything more to it than this, I am not aware of it.

             I wonder why Q is bringing us back to this. Did Clinton promise anything to NK?

              Q keeps asking "who really runs North Korea." So North Korea is not what we've been told. All a big farce, probably CIA or really big money or both.

              I know you're a shill but the truth is not that far off. The problem is, people have taken the whole Reptilian meme literally. The answer is actually in the word 'Reptilian', which is interestingly an adjective and not a noun.
             </p>
             <p>
              The Answer is that they're
              <em>
               Serpentines
              </em>
              , and are part of a Venetian-Londoner cabal known as the royal serpentine order. They run the world through medical institutions and art galleries (see: Tony Podesta), the latter providing cover for secret shipping channels, their bases including Venice (Venice Biennale) and Miami (Art Basel), frequented by Alefantis et al.
             </p>
             <p>
              The Medical foundation segment is run by the Sackler's, the family behind valium and oxycontin. They run several different institutions, all under an umbrella pejoratively known as "Tavistock".

               Your information is interesting and I enjoy learning as much as I can from all perspectives. I have been researching this stuff for nearly ten years long before it was called pizzagate. And after a lot of research I personally dont believe those we are fighting are human. Raping babies and eating their pineal glands is by most peoples standards anti human. Perhaps its time some of you actually faced this reality. I dont know if they are reptile or otherwise but the amount of references in our history to reptiles as gods is staggering. Look into it. It is possible they are another species of humanoid. All I do know is they want to feed of us.
              </p>
              <p>
               As crazy as it sounds this is no more outrageous than Christians, Muslims, Jews etc believing in a god they cant see or prove and following rules in old books. Books that to my mind appear to have been written to control the masses. How does anyone really know who wrote human scripture. Maybe it was written by these very non humans you refuse to consider.
              </p>
              <p>
               You wont shut down my opinion by calling me a shill. This is as damaging to the free flow of ideas and the success of this investigation as the behaviour and censorship of those we are fighting against. You are acting no better than the deep state cabal worldfuckers by trying to intimidate and censor my contribution. Its time for you to relize yours is not the only information or opinion out there.

                Sorry, I didn't mean to sound derisive, it's just a very hyperbolic conspiracy that allows passive viewers to bundle pizzagate research into claims of supernatural biomorphism.

                You should read "The Sigma Protocol" by Robert Ludlum, he wrote the Bourne books and knew everything about MK Ultra/Monarch. he mentioned (in a diatribe of historical info) that some of the elite consumed blood that was laced with a venom peptide, which I can only guess was a kind of symbolic marriage of human and inhuman blood.

                Shame you hold humans in such high regard and don't accept how hideous they can be. If you want to ignore a history of cruelty and hate, then I guess you have to fabricate an alien race that is responsible for the worlds troubles. If you were selling disinfo, you would do it the same way.

                 Exactly. Zionists or space aliens. One of these can be arrested for their crimes and one cannot. If I was the Zionists machine I would blame it on the space aliens.

                 I see a lot of people shutting down the whole Reptilian angle, but there is a more to it than muh Reptiles. Lets just say that the universe and even our solar system isn't as empty as we thought.

                  Absolutely and Im not saying its as simple as 'Reptiles rule the world' either. I am saying we need to look more deeply into this. Why do they only marry  their own bloodline for example? That would indicate they are different....a different species perhaps.....who the hell knows....Im just flagging this for further investigation.

                   I don't think they are all Reptilians; very few of them will be. I do however believe that Reptiles have colluded with elites in our society in exchange for sovereignity. Look up Admiral Byrd's testimonies on his missions in Antarctica, about the Nazis and their bases. According to him, their technology is on another level and that is no coincidence.

                They aren't really human in the sense of having any humanity. They have more primitive, reptilian brains, simply meaning that they aren't evolved. How do we know? They are filthy rich and aren't interested in helping people that are dying every day of starvation. If you have the means to do that and don't, you aren't human.

                 I agree. Apart from blooddrinking pedophiles if you then think about GMO's, chem trails, vaccines, contrived wars, big pharma, flouride, debt slavery etc etc it certainly seems like an anti human agenda. Most people only think of these issues seperately but when you take it in as a whole it starts to looks much more sinister.

                  They hate good people, hate the light, want to kill us off. I don't think they are different in a physical sense, more in terms of a lack of empathy &amp; consciousness. You could also say they are like psychopaths.

                I try to keep all this stuff in a real world context and apply it to what I know about their philosophy and it makes more sense to me than imagining anything supernatural. It usually leads me closer to the truth.

                They consider themselves gods on earth and not like the rest of us. So if we are human then they are gods, so as a result they are not human. Hardcore jews have the same mindset. They literally consider themselves a different species than us all together. We are animals. Talmud repeatedly calls us animals and beasts.

                We can see their true form at this point in history more than most times in history. Technology is allowing us to see and understand what they really are. They are unable to "maintain their shape", or their appearance of being kind caretakers and responsible. We are seeing the psychopath they truly are. That caring face is "shifting" into the face of a psychopath to our perspective because we understand them.
               </p>
               <p>
                One of the main contexts of them surviving on blood is not only drinking it but surviving on the bloodshed they create by causing misfortune and death for others. Bloodshed equals survival and wealth for them because they profit from it. So they literally make a living and survive from bloodshed of wars and violence. If a population becomes aware of their lying trickery, also known as being a shifty person, they will sometimes create a mass slaughter false flag to distract people and create the illusion that we need them.
               </p>
               <p>
                911, constant threats of war "North Korea will attack us", and actual wars too, World War 2. People that cannot be trusted have long been known as being "shifty." Psychopaths can kiss a baby one minute in public for appearance and torture one to death the next minute. So that person "shifted" his character from one extreme to the other because he is a shifty mother fucker.
               </p>
               <p>
                So if they need more blood they need more bloodshed. Like maybe a world war between major countries. Anything to make our life hell and create bloodshed to keep us destabilized.

                We will be so dependent and powerless that we will not be able to threaten their rule. Maybe we are all microchipped, or a cashless society so they can cut our money off. Have control of all water and food so that if we disobey they can starve us all to death. We are so dumbed down and hypnotized by TV that we don't know we are captives. They will drug us through our water and food, whatever, it takes, etc...
               </p>
               <p>
                But the end result is that they have absolutely no fear at all of us seeing what they are truly like so they no longer have to pretend. They won't need to "shift" from one personality to another. They will just be right up front full on depraved psychopaths right in our face and I promise you they dream of that every day.

                 This is how I think but I couldn't have articulated as well.  The microchip is coming. India is the NWO test country. Earlier this year, in a short time span, India banned the majority of their cash by getting rid of all but the smallest notes, forcing everybody to return the money for smaller bills or bank credits(deposit accounts). They then banned any large holdings of gold and threatened to confiscate any amount above the allowed limit. Modi continually gets on TV and tells people not to buy gold. They then made Bitcoin legal. Crypto currencies are an agenda to normalise hypothetical digital currency. They use the ruse that it is from from the banking system. It is liekly a trap and all transaction will be monitered. They are not anonymous. And the creater of Bitcoin is never been proven, only a name Satoshi Namimoto was given, but nobody knows who they are. I am thinking the NSA.
                </p>
                <p>
                 Europe is already forbiding any cash transaction in large amounts, forcing you to have a bank account for any bog purchases like an automobile. They are also talking about getting rid of larger bills in many Euro countries because this would take the majority of physical currency out of circulation.
                </p>
                <p>
                 I think as early as the next two years it is probable that they will make their move to take away the cash. All the while, they have the metals market rigged and supressed indfinately so you can never profit from it anymore. They don't want you investing in it. The quesion to me is, will they try to take the guns first, or take away your finnancial freedom first, and then make a move on the guns? When both are accomlished, the game is over.

                 Well this interpretation is absolutely possible too. One thing we can say for sure is that a massive anti human agenda exists. Why? Healthy humans dont feed on their own young, they protect them. So does their behaviour look human. No it does not. They could just be another species of humanoid I dont know but I am now extremely  suspicious of them.

                  I think most  the alien phenomenon is demonic .
I was raised a hardcore atheists but now I back Jesus /Christianity .
Something that changed my mind about religion is that one of the only ways to stop a "abduction" is to call on Jesus for help. That was the first thing that made me realizes Jesus has power.

                  What is conusing? It is disinfo to try to get you to tell people that reptilians are traficking and eating people. I'm sure people will listen to you. They do the same with the idiotic flat earth psyop. People found out about NASA's constant lies, so they made a disinfo campaign to say "NASA lies, the Earth is Flat!". Typical attempt to discredit the truth by asociating it with an absurd theory that they attached to it.

              You are an imbecile, the web page you give as "evidence" is a joke and the so called link to an official page is a fake. No such link exists or has ever existed.

               I am not claiming its 'evidence'. Just trying to open the conversation to possible explanations for the current undeniable anti human agenda. There are plenty of thoroughly referenced sources about this matetial. Try David Icke for a start.

                    I am not fully convinced yet, but am entertaining the thought. If the reptilian part is true, where my mind has wandered is completely insane and beyond disgusting.  But when you think about it, that describes them to a T.  There is a combo that includes menstrual blood.  That is all I will say.  How they possibly obtain enough of this for all of them and year after year, it just popped into my head a few days ago and I hope to God I am wrong.

                      I don't know because now that the idea has come to me, I find it hard to dig any further, for it disgusts me so.  My mind seems to just stop when it comes to mind.  I just don't want it to be true.

                      I am not saying it is true but just that when I had read a few times about the reptilian thing, all of a sudden it just hit me, only because I know how evil they are.    You are not missing out on anything, only if it is true.  I am hoping it is not.
