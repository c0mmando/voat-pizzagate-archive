            MTO has always been super ghetto and trashy. I think they're low educated buffoons, but not pedophiles.

            In an interesting twist, the head and founder of Media Take Out's BIGGEST rivals - "World Star Hip Hop" was mysteriously and randomly murdered just a couple of weeks ago.

            LOL! Its Biggie and Tupac all over again.

            And I'm pretty certain the owners are being paid to post this.  Lots of sites like MTO took HILLARY money during the campaign.

            The first one is quite inappropriate, yeah. I don't know if there's any "pushing". Don't think so. Isn't it just a case of really bad taste? Never heard of mtwonews before but it looks trashy.

             They're low educated, ghetto thugs. This is how they all speak: inappropriately, but not with any real contextual understanding (because, again, they're just really dumb.)
