<p>Thegoldwater.com/news/30033-Clinton-Campaign-Worker-Arrested-by-FBI-for-Child-Sexual-Abuse-of-Kids-as-Young-as-Two</p>
<p>member of Hillary Clinton\'s 2016 Presidential campaign in New York has now been arrested for child sexual abuse, with 22-year-old Joel Davis being taken into custody by federal law enforcement agents with the FBI for both the attempted child molestation of toddlers and infants as well as the possession of child pornography.</p>
<p>Caution to ALL Readers: Some of the language used below as per the case files against Joel Davis are EXTREMELY GRAPHIC!</p>
<p>Joel Davis was also once a Nobel Prize nominee, according to local news reports.</p>
<p>Federal prosecutors say that Joel Davis was both a disturbing pedophile who attempted to manipulate children as young as two years old into forced-child sexual abuses but also worked as an advocate for the abuse of children through online practices.</p>
<p>Davis is the chairman of the International Campaign to Stop Rape and Gender Violence in Conflict, and also the Youth to End Sexual Violence, outside of his work on the 2016 Hillary Clinton for President campaign.</p>
<p>According to several Federal Bureau of Investigation agents, Davis attempted to solicit undercover FBI agents into having sexually explicit encounters with him, where he believed he was preying upon young children.</p>
<p>Davis also asked for those agents, who he believed were young children, to send him illicit child pornographic videos and images.</p>
<p>Federal prosecutors say that Davis engaged in the exchange of numerous text message conversations in which he proposed the agents, believing that he could arrange sexual relations with the children, of which led to an eventual execution of a search warrant on his residence.</p>
<p>After raiding the home of Davis, investigators would discover a large cache of child pornographic videos and images which depicted prepubescent children engaged in the sexual abuse by adult males and females.</p>
<p>Agents say that they also found images and videos of infant babies and toddlers, making Davis a severely disturbing pedophile who poses a serious risk to the safety and security of children, as reported by The Daily Mail.</p>
<p>went into graphic detail about the exact sexual positions he wanted to molest the infants and toddlers in, describing grotesque pedophilia-laced fantasies that one would expect from a Clinton-backing Democratic Party elitist.</p>
<p>As per conversations with FBI special agents, Joel Davis also arranged a meeting with one of the FBI agent\'s nine-year-old daughter, as well as the two-year-old child of one of the authority’s girlfriends.</p>
<p>Davis believed he was talking to a parent who was willing to sell sexual relationships with their young children and was quite outspoken about his desire to rape the infants and toddlers, according to federal prosecutors.</p>
<p>Once Davis was taken into custody, he admitted to investigators that he had a longstanding fetish for sexual relations with children, and also confessed to sexually Abusing a 13-year-old child in the past.</p>
<p>“Having started an organization that pushed for the end of sexual violence, Davis displayed the highest degree of hypocrisy by his alleged attempts to sexually exploit multiple minors,” FBI Assistant Director-in-Charge William F. Sweeney Jr. said of Joel Davis. “As if this wasn\'t repulsive enough, Davis allegedly possessed and distributed utterly explicit images of innocent infants and toddlers being sexually abused by adults.”</p>
<p>On Tuesday, Joel Davis appeared before a federal court magistrate in which he was publicly arraigned on charges of the enticement of a minor to engage in sexual activity, attempted sexual exploitation of a minor, possession of child pornography, and receipt and distribution of child pornography.</p>
<p>According to the LinkedIn profile of Joel Davis, he was highly educated at some of the nation\'s top universities, making this premeditated assault upon children even more concerning.</p>
<p>“Current student with a demonstrated history of working in the non-profit organization management industry. Skilled in Nonprofit Organizations, Public Speaking, Organizational Leadership, International Relations, Translation, and Creative Writing. Strong business development professional and creative writer with a Bachelor’s Degree focused in Classics (Ancient Studies) from Columbia University,” Joel Davis’ LinkedIn says.</p>
<p>It describes Davis as having received a Bachelor’s Degree at Columbia University in the City of New York, attending The Juilliard School, as well as having studied International Law at the University of OxfoRd</p>
<p>US Att Geoffrey S. Berman described Davis\' desire to rape and molest children as young as toddlers and infants in diapers as being both &quot;unfathomable” and “sickening,” ......</p>
<p>“Davis started an org devoted to stopping sexual violence, while allegedly engaged in the duplicitous behavior of sharing explicit images of infants engaged in sexual activity,” US Att Geoffrey S. Berman said “Davis also allegedly solicited an undercover officer - whom he thought to be a willing participant – to send sexually explicit videos of his nine-year-old daughter, and even to set up a sexual encounter between himself and a two-year-old.”</p>
<p>“The conduct alleged against Joel Davis is sickening, and law enforcement will keep its watchful eye on the darkest corners of the internet to bring predators to justice,” US Attorney Berman added.</p>
<p>Davis used the screen name “Yngperv22,” when Davis responded to ads from undercover FBI agents looking for paying customers to molest their children.</p>
<p>“Looking for other no limits TABOO pervs in DC area. Bi dad here.” Authorities within the FBI posted, of which they say Davis responded to that message under the username, “Yngperv22.”</p>
<p>“Need me to come down and watch ur kids for a night :).” Davis told an agent that he was sexually interested in children “+0,” suggesting he wanted newborn babies to rape.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.abovetopsecret.com/forum/thread1210989/pg1">http://www.abovetopsecret.com/forum/thread1210989/pg1</a></p>
<p>&quot;If ur legit I’d love to come down and eat her pussy.” Davis said about a child he believed was only nine-years-old, “I just want her cunt… I just want to eat her cunt so bad.”</p>
<p>In another conversation, Davis described his sexual abuse of a 7-year-old boy, in which he said he was unable to achieve anal sex with the child because his penis was too large ........... ugh</p>
<p>Davis specifically said he “couldn\'t get it in because the child was struggling,” in a perverse rant showcasing just how demented this pedophile monster is.</p>

            This is about one of the sickest articles ever.  What can we say about this guy except that he is a danger to children, and really, I think he should never be let out of jail.  Ever.  This is enough to make Anyone SICK. How in the world can we keep Our Children away from this kind of stuff when their own parents will set them up to meet someone like This Pervert.  I don't know how undercover LE can do that kind of job.  I could not sleep nights just thinking about all those sickos I have to talk to tomorrow.

              Look into who her parents were.  Mother head of something.  I can't remember it all now.  I think her Dad headed some org. and he died and Mother took over.  She was raised in Saudi thinking home.  Probably brainwashed, who knows.

              We flair anything fairly old that has been presented as if it is new. Most people make some note in the title about when it was published. Then we don't flair.

             Wherever u see power, and positions of power to decieve u will find sociopaths..who then form a ring..
Case.in point is thenpriesthood...they do not hold any governmental power...but power within their church and money to bribe  police....The police have pedorings , pentagon has pedorings, bankers have pedorings, parliaments have pedorings, all controlling the relevant power structure....school.districts have pedo rings ..as well as nursury chains ...
Its a massive.pedo empire..and they r not gonna let go..
So the only way to dissolve the wicked witch is to get out of HER ASAP
