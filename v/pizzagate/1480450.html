            Did you actually read this?
           </p>
           <p>
            Andrew Kline is the registrar, its all the same person. Read or shut the fuck up.
           </p>

            If you have proof then show us your proof, your word is bile.

            The most perceptive insights on VOAT are focused on Arab-Saudi ownership of the entire city block underneath Comet Pizza and a nearby pizzeria called Besta (not Basta, the Italian word for enough or too much), operated by Abdul Hamade (Abdel Rahmann Hammad), who is also owner of the Boli pizza chain) and Samir Sbitan. Besta, as in bestiality, has for its logo the “Boy Lovers” symbol, a triangular spiral. Are there any sheep out back?
           </p>
           <p>
            The entire lot under Besta and Comet is owned, on paper at least, by attorney Andrew J. Kline, a graduate of the Kennedy School at Harvard. To disguise his government work at the Department of Justice, Kline hides behind a front business, the “Veritas” law office located on Dupont Circle and with a field office in Chevy Chase, near Comet Pizza. Further pursuit by online researchers showed the same curly-haired lawyer Kline to be a Bill Clinton appointee in the Department of Justice (DOJ) Human Trafficking Prosecution Unit, when Janet Reno was Attorney General.
           </p>
           <p>
            The junior partner at Veritas is Stephen J. Whelan, who worked previously at Metro (the D.C. Transport Agency), an interesting coincidence with the controversy over the old Red Line Tunnel under Connecticut Avenue, mentioned in a John Podesta email.
           </p>
           <p>
            Kline’s employment with Justice causes some befuddlement among Pizzagate hunters, as it raises the question of whether Comet Pizza is an FBI honey trap to nab international child-smugglers. My educated guess is no, based on my work in an undercover journalistic probe into the secret activities of the human-trafficking bureau at Justice and the State Department.
           </p>
           <p>
            Despite its pretense of stopping people smugglers, the human trafficking program does the exact opposite, organizing and facilitating the transport of, say, North Koreans and Chinese Uyghurs into Thailand and onto the US territory of Saipan. U.S. consular officers provide money and fake passports to “snakeheads” from China and, more recently, Turkish traffickers who transported Mideast and African migrants by boat to Greece and onto Germany since the summer of 2015. The human trafficking officers aid and abet the flow of illegals, and often prevent immigration and Border Patrol from detaining their live cargo.
           </p>
           <p>
            Certainly, the Podesta brothers would not be assigned to a honey trap, as that would compromise their intelligence roles. The large property in Chevy Chase has to be part of a political bribery deal between the Arabs and the Clintons, now being protected by the Obama administration.

            Pizzagate investigators are not befuddled about anything except why you are spreading false information.
 Please explain the TWO different Andrew Klines.

               Andrew Kline of Veritas is the AGENT of multiple restaurants in the DC area, as in representative with authority to register. This does not make him owner of Besta Pizza or any other eatery.
              </li>
              <li>
               Andrew Kline of DOJ is a DIFFERENT person but also NOT the owner.
              </li>
             </ol>
             <p>
              Other than getting a blood sample, the two DIFFERENT pictures of two DIFFERENT men will stand as evidence for debunking.
             </p>
             <p>
              Continuous insistence that DOJ Andrew Kline...or any other Andrew Kline is the owner of Besta Pizza...is at best - ignorant disinformation, at worst - purposeful disinformation.
