<p>Written by Max Botkin and Marc Hyman</p>
<p>Starring Will Arnett as &quot;Max,&quot; Chris &quot;Ludacris&quot; Bridges. Natalie Lyonne, Jordan Sparks, Gabriel Iglesias, Shaquille O\'Neal, Omar Chaparro, and Stanley Tucci.</p>
<p>The plot - A Rottweiler police dog (Max) and his human FBI partner go undercover at a prestigious dog show to stop an animal (a panda) smuggling activity.

<p>The film is actually normalizing &quot;child grooming&quot;  and molestation - grooming children to be open to having people touch their privates even though they don\'t want it.
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Show_Dogs">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Show_Dogs</a></p>
<p>Max and his partner investigate the kidnapping of a baby panda by an underground network of illegal animal traders.  They get a tip that the crime ring is planning to sell the panda at a prestigious dog show.  The &quot;macho&quot; Max undergoes a makeover to go undercover - mud baths, ballet lessons, a Brazilian waxing - to enter the competition.

<p>From the movie script - &quot;Max needs to get it together, see, and let people touch his private parts or  he might lose the competition and fail at his mission to rescue the kidnapped panda.&quot;</p>
<p>The day of the finals comes and the judge\'s hands slowly reach behind Max, and he goes to his &quot;zen place.&quot;  He\'s flying through the sky, dancing with his partner, there are fireworks and flowers. Everything is great - all while soneone is touching his private parts.</p>

           <p>
            I don't know if someone already reported this, but all of us putting a warning for Show Dogs on fagbook may have helped.
           </p>
           <p>
            They are pulling the movie to edit out the graphic pedo scenes. A small victory for the good guys.

            I read in the comments a couple of other movies that had come out with pedo content and looked them up on Pluggedin to see who had reviewed those movies. Ready Player One and the Baby Boss. Interestingly it was again Bob Hoose, he gave baby boss a 3.5/5 with no mention of the sexual innuendo "jokes" of pacifiers stuck up butts and "suck harder" on a pacifier.

           <p>
            He is also the one who reviewed Show Dogs with no mention of the inappropriate scenes. Of which apparently there were many.
           </p>
           <p>
            This link mentions another disturbing scene that the Christian review sites "missed".

            Weird. There are similar scenes in that recent “boss baby” movie. I forgot the title, but it also just turned into a Netflix series. Their were more than a few of the pedo symbols hidden in the film at various points. My wife and kid were oblivious, but I’m sure pedos noticed. It made me wonder if movies likes this are made for scouting, associating, grooming and/or recruiting purposes within pedo culture... like maybe someone in that theatre could be a pedo scout/recruiter looking for babies with weak or single parents or whatnot.

            Looks like common sense media made light of it.  Adjusted their commentary
            <em>
             after
            </em>
            multiple negative comments, but still made no big deal of it.

            That is a very disturbing description. It is too similar to what victims of molestation talk about when they were experiencing their trauma.

            We know that pedos are attracted to occupations with children - teachers, admins, CPS/foster, daycare.  We also know that fat disgusting pedo - Dan Schneider, I think - worked for Nickelodeon.  They infiltrated every possible place they could.  I'm wondering what other "industries" have been affected?

            I have several young kids and my time is severely limited but could someone please do some digging on Pluggled in online (focus on the family) and the man who reviewed this movie? Bob Hoose. He did not mention the grooming scene and when he received tremendous backlash for it he issued a blog non apology basically saying the original parent to call attention to the scenes was the one with problems and "baggage". He works for focus on the family. Look at the content of his other blog posts. Also note the extensive comments by "bobed" on the blog posts. One blog is about a being red pilled, some on barbies, some on risqué apps kids use today. It warrants further investigation as does FOcus on the family. Plugged in is supposed to warn parents of content like this in movies! And Hoose not only failed to do so but then goes into victim blaming mode in his blog post. If I'm allowed to post links here I would post it. Not sure if I am tho. But easy to find, look for plugged in on Facebook and it's all there.

             I don't really know where to search for info like this (particularly while browsing on my phone late at night), but out of the very few pieces of intel I could find on this guy:
            </p>
            <ol>
             <li>
              <p>
               His biographies always make a big deal out of his past on Christian "comedy tropes/duos" (without ever really mentioning his current views or actions).  Could there be some ties with the old groups back to the "pedophile priests" scandal that still keeps rocking the Catholic Church?
              </p>
             </li>
             <li>
              <p>
               He has
               <strong>
                <em>
                 A LOT
                </em>
               </strong>
               of time credited on/around a TV series called
               <em>
                Adventures in Odyssey
               </em>
               .  Could he have ties to Weinstein and his ilk through this production?
              </p>
             </li>
            </ol>
            <p>
             This definitely needs more time/energy spent searching, but the idea that someone at an organization called "Focus on the Family" could somehow miss
             <strong>
              <em>
               THE DISGUSTING NATURE OF THIS FILTH'S KEY PLOT POINT
              </em>
             </strong>
             just screams to me that there
             <em>
              is definitely something here for us to find
             </em>

              Thank you! I have tried to do some digging myself. Mainly reading Bob Hoose other blog posts. He blogs on a Christian website that reviews media for parents. I will try to link to some of the blog posts if I can. If it doesn't work just google plugged in and you can find his blog. He has one about being red pillled (wasn't that term created about pizzagate?)
              <a href="https://pluggedin.focusonthefamily.com/taking-red-pill/">
               https://pluggedin.focusonthefamily.com/taking-red-pill/
              </a>
             </p>
             <p>
              This blog is about how a family's home security cameras were hacked and people were live streaming her two young daughters from their bedroom.
             </p>
             <p>
              <a href="https://pluggedin.focusonthefamily.com/nightmare-close-home/">
               https://pluggedin.focusonthefamily.com/nightmare-close-home/
              </a>
             </p>
             <p>
              And I found this one to be the worst in which he waxes on about teen bodies and how A&amp;F are changing their marketing strategy. Most telling those is the comment in which a reader reminds Bob that teen bodies do look great and their tanned curves will always sell clothes.
             </p>
             <p>
              <a href="https://pluggedin.focusonthefamily.com/abercrombie-shelving-sexy-ads/">
               https://pluggedin.focusonthefamily.com/abercrombie-shelving-sexy-ads/
              </a>
             </p>
             <p>
              Also note Bobed in the comments sections. He commented on the security camera one and has made tons of comments staunchly defending Hoose on the blog post justifiying his review of show dogs.
             </p>
             <p>
              Last thing I'll note is that Focus on the family is a Christian company and plugged in is an extension of that. They are supposed to review new video games, movies, apps and music and let parents know what type of material it contains. Some of Hoose blog posts just seem so random and unrelated to that. Like A&amp;F models, revenge porn, even one on barbies. I want to post in the comments on the show dogs blog post and draw other readers to examine his other blog posts. But I'm afraid they will delete stuff. I don't know how to archive pages.

            I am SO GLAD voat picked up this story. I can't post topics as I'm new to the forum but this is a great red pill story to share with friends. Reading some of the comments on Facebook of the show dogs movie page (which since I took note of it went from a 2.8 to a 1.3 rating in less than 24 hours) there are people beginning to wake up. "How could someone write that into a children s script? They must be a...a....a pedophile!!!!!"  NO SHIT SHERLOCK! I hope this opens the eyes of many parents.

            So who is
            <strong>
             the director
            </strong>
            of this movie?
           </p>
           <p>
            It is Raja Gosnell (male American) - he was editor of the movies
            <strong>
             'Home alone'
            </strong>
            and
            <strong>
             'Home alone 2'
            </strong>
            , starring
            <strong>
             Macauly Culkin
            </strong>
            . (!!!)
           </p>
           <p>
            Pizzagate researchers suspected that Culkin, like many child actors, was raped on set. If this should have 
been the case, maybe Grossnell was part of the gang.
           </p>
           <p>
            Then he
            <em>
             directed
            </em>
            'Home alone 3' - with another child actor.

            I thought this was just going to be some overreacting shit, but nope, the central theme, the conflict the main character must overcome... is to let friends and strangers fondle his junk.  And he is supposed to like it.

            I could see if it was like, "dogs sniff butts and junk" and it's a quick haha in the movie because that's what dogs do.  But nope, this is the major theme of the movie.  Fuck these guys and fuck this movie.

             I personally saw someone bringing 3 little kids to go see it this past weekend, only learning what they were seeing when one of the kids loudly misspoke while telling the usher what movie they were going to.
            </p>
            <p>
             I had no idea that there was even a movie out right now that was called "Show Dogs", and now, for the sake of the next generation, I wish that this movie had died long before release (like so many other scripts in the Hollywood backlots and coffee shops).

             For Spielberg, why not use "Lights, Camera, Action"* as his execution. After what he did to Heather O'Rourke and Judith Barsi, he deserves a "very special punishment."
            </p>
            <ul>
             <li>
              He is tied up and placed in a giant fish tank full of water. A guy in a magician costume slides a curtain (a back stage assistant disables the lock on a trick door in the tank, releasing a man eating shark, then dumps a whole bunch of chum into the tank). Magician unfurls curtain, revealing the shark (intentionally made real hungry) to the audience. Magician slides curtain....then opens it, revealing no Spielberg.
             </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
             Believe me, the cabal and deep state as a whole ALL deserve Danganronpa style executions for all the henious shit they've done. This one is both a reference to the unused one for Aoi Asahina (one of the game's survivors) AND an ironic way to execute Spielberg due to being a Jaws reference.

              ...part of me wanted to ask what Spielberg actually did, but after learning what kind of rotten horse cancer they just put into a "blockbuster" movie "for the children", I don't actually want to know.

               I've been investigating both cases (updated Barsi case yesterday).
              </p>
              <p>
               Short Hand: Spielberg is the prime suspect in both incidents (Twilight Zone TV show and Jaws the Revenge) of sexual abuse regarding Judith Barsi and the prime suspect for Heather O'Rourke in the Poltergeist films.
              </p>
              <p>
               Perhaps the "magician's assistants" should all look like ghosts to mock Spielberg over Poltergeist.

              <p>
               Look at your own discretion. The details regarding Heather O'Rourke are MUCH worse than Judith Barsi, especially in regards to the Rocky Road incident (which was fatal). 1 suspect I believe is Itallian (Arthur), don't know regarding Gene.

             We all crowdfund a Falcon launch, and load them into the nosecone. The cone ejects them into orbit, and we can watch as they re-enter the atmosphere and burn up.

                I would not enjoy the idea that they might survive the re-entry and the impact, or that their bloody corpses could be used as martyrs to advocate for their monstrous cause.  Better to burn them all with the hottest flames in our entire solar system.

               Counterintuitive as it may seem, you actually need a
               <em>
                metric shitload
               </em>
               of
               <em>
                Δv
               </em>
               to put something on a collision course with the Sun. Kerbal Space Program taught me that, lol

                Oh, I know, but we can use the "gravitational slingshot" method with the Earth, the moon, Mars, or Jupiter (our closest/largest targets for a slingshot) to cut down on fuel costs, and it is better to spend the extra effort making sure that there is no chance that any of them will ever return (and sending a clear signal of "We have no mercy for this atrocity.  Repent now, or face a similar fate in the future." to any monsters we missed in the first round of arrests).

             You are brilliant. This movie WILL make it easier to redpill everyone.
            </p>
            <p>
             Just don't let your kids see it. And maybe we should explain the problems with the movie just in case your kids see it at a friends house.

               For the sake of your sanity, I hope that you didn't look too deep into the PizzaGate stuff, the ElsaGate YouTube channels, or the creepy infant-obsessed Instagram/Facebook accounts owned by even-creepier old men like Alefantis and his ilk.

               That stuff is like a fast-track straight from the standard Red Pill to an ultra-depression Black Pill.  All you need to know is "the pedophiles are out there, and they've been getting disgustingly blatant in their degenerate behavior, only getting truly exposed by the #GreatAwakening caused by the Internet and President Trump".

            This is totally crazy. How can anyone take their kids to this movie? There should have been protests in front of the cinemas.

             Turn on the Disney Channel or Nickelodeon and wait 2 minutes. If you can stomach it, watch 'Bunk'd' or 'Mod Squad' and count the crypto pedo references in a single episode. There is not a single show on either network that is not steeped in pedo symbolism and grooming.

                Word. I was waiting for the "muh sports" or "muh fox news". Cable is absolute cancer. Generally around $120 a month for 60% commercials and the rest is pushing some agenda.

              Why is it that, every time I look at the direction that our "children's entertainment" is going, it always feels like it is degenerating as fast as it possibly can?  I mean, I remember the old TV shows that got kids to view emergency responders (firefighters, policemen, etc.) on a similar level with superheroes, or got them excited about learning real geography, history, and/or culture.

               I started investigating these shows about 6 months ago and you're right, the slippery slope has become a conduit straight to hell.  They are not even trying to hide it, anymore.

                At this point, I want multiple volcanoes to go off simultaneously all around Hollywood, and just burn that entire place into molten rubble.  Same with Jew York City and every other place that those slimy bastards lives or used to live.

                   Turn off/ get rid of the electronics and HOME SCHOOL YOUR CHILDREN...EVEN FOR COLLEGE. IF 20% of the population did this for the upcoming school year WE WOULD PUT THEM OUT OF BUSINESS. The people have the power.  They just need to use it.

                     They didn't get their influence overnight. It has been years in the making; going from Leave it to Beaver and Lassie to Dog Vomit (new name for Show Dogs). They are very patient and accomplish plans GENERATIONALLY. The CONSUMERS must be changed back rather than what is consumed. Give children a taste for health food not fast food.

                   Earthquakes are another story.  There is a huge fault somewhere around MO that could be catastrophic.  DE had a 5 or 6 last year.  A little one in DC still did millions in damage to old buildings.

              It truly is everywhere, but I just don't think most parents realize it.  Cartoons keep the kids entertained and the parents ecstatic.  Why do most couples even have children?  It makes no sense.
