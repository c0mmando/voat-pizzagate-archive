            It's not a coincidence that Epstein and his network is Jewish. It's not a coincidence that practically all the paedophile rings and Satanic cults that get busted are primarily comprised of Jews. Judaism permits paedophilia. It's no different than Islam in that sense, and Islam is actually based upon the five books of Moses. Islam is derived from the name Ishmael who was the son of Abraham. The conflict between Jews and Muslims is territorial, not ideological. The point I'm making is that Judaism is like Islam in the sense that paedophilia is part of the religion.
           </p>
           <p>
            Pizzagate is Jewish Khaballism. Kahalballism is Satanism which is a wing of Judaism. Anybody that says Judaism and Satanism is unrelated is a flat out liar. Anybody that says Satanism has nothing to do with pizzagate is once again simply a liar. If you want to bust the Italian mafia you must investigate the Italian community. If you wish to investigate radical Islam you must investigate the Islamic community. If you want you investigate Satanic occultism you must investigate Judaism and the Jewish community. Political correctness has no place in an investigation.

            The Finders Cult

            Pizzagate is nothing new. There was a Satanic cult of Jews that was busted in Florida during the 80s for kidnapping children. The police even raided a warehouse where they found pictures of children engaging in Satanic rituals. Here's some information I've compiled on them. Like I said, Pizzagate is nothing new.

            I've identified the first Satanic band in America and more importantly who's behind them. The lead singer in Coven comes from an elite politically active family and she admits this herself and even names who they are.
           </p>
           <p>
            Here's the first Satanic band called Coven.
           </p>
           <p>
            <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coven_(band)">

            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            They're also the band that started using the devil horn hand gesture.

            Well guess what, their producer Bill Traut was Jewish, as were at least two of the band members.

           </p>
           <p>
            Guess what else? He wrote songs for them including a 13 min black mass.
           </p>
           <p>
            "The album concluded with a 13-minute track of chanting and Satanic prayers called "Satanic Mass" (written by their producer, Bill Traut, of Dunwich Productions, and described as "the first Black Mass to be recorded, either in written words or in audio")."

            So now I've just proven that Jews started the Satanic music scene, which isn't surprising considering the fact that Satanic occultists are primarily Jews.
           </p>
           <p>
            I'm still going to do more research into all this, but I already know what's up. Jews are Satanists. Jews worship the devil. The Torah Jews are the common Jews which listen to the Rabbis that study the Talmud (Rabbinical Judaism) and the top Rabbis are selected to study Khaballism, which is Satanism.
           </p>
           <p>
            The Torah Jews are puppets to the Talmudists who are puppets to the Khaballists. Jews are Satanic.
           </p>
           <p>
            I'm not religious, but look what Jesus said, who was a Jew btw.
           </p>
           <p>
            " You belong to your father, the devil, and you want to carry out your father's desires. He was a murderer from the beginning, not holding to the truth, for there is no truth in him. When he lies, he speaks his native language, for he is a liar and the father of lies."

           </p>
           <p>
            Ignoring all this religious stuff, the fact still remains that Jews invented Satanic music and the majority of Satanists are Jews.

            Now here's a lead for you guys to investigate. The singer of Coven Jinx Dawson gave an interview where she admits her family is involved in the occult and politics and even names them.
           </p>
           <p>
            <a href="http://popcultureaddict.com/interviews/jinxdawson/">

            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            She ultimately says that her Grandfather was a Free Mason and it's common knowledge that Free Masonry is a front for Judaism. I can show you statements made by both Rabbis and Masons where they admit that Free Masonry is based upon Judaism.

            Let's take a look at their lyrics now. What they're describing is Jewish blood libel. Jews have been accused and found guilty of doing these things all throughout history. Don't forget these lyrics are written by a Jew.

            Judaism is Satanism. It's not a coincidence that all the primary elites busted in paedophile rings are Jews. Epstein has a sacrificial alter on his private paedophile Island.

            This is not a good trend. 
I understand that there is a problem here in regards to the "J" topic. 
I don't think people/especially mods, understand what Kaballah is - or the fact that it is heavily referenced in the works of occultists.
This doesnt make it a jew thing. Kaballah, while having ties to Judaism - is it's own entity entirely.
The comment by that mod is disturbing. "No, you are not". Well, thats just great - stifle any possible investigation into the topic because you deem it a 'distraction' or 'dangerous'.
It's pretty clear to most that there are dark things in play here.
We are here to investigate that and find the truth - WHEREVER IT LEADS US.
Preconceptions of what can or cannot be related are mental gymnastics - period.
Satanism is just as much a part of Pizzagate as is CP - once this fact is proven definitively, a lot of people here are going to feel pretty shocked and ashamed of themselves, I reckon.
