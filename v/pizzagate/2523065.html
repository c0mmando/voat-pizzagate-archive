            , I see this post seems to frozen. Just an fyi: Voat currently has a bug that causes view and vote counts to get stuck if you edit a post. To gain more visibility, you may want to to repost this and remove this version and then not edit so that it can get some eyeballs. Ping me if you do, and I'll give the new one a "Potential Lead" flair like I'm giving this verson to see if we can get additional diggers in here.

            About Child Help
           </p>
           <p>
            Childhelp is a national non-profit organization dedicated to the prevention and treatment of child abuse. Founded in 1959 as International Orphans, Inc
           </p>
           <p>
            Operation Babylift
           </p>
           <p>
            on April 3, 1975, U.S. President Gerald Ford announced that the U.S. government would begin evacuating orphans from Saigon on a series of 30 planned flights aboard Military Airlift Command (MAC) C-5A Galaxy and C-141 Starlifter cargo aircraft.
           </p>
           <p>
            Service organizations including Holt International Children's Services, Friends of Children of Viet Nam (FCVN), Friends For All Children (FFAC), Catholic Relief Service, International Social Services, International Orphans and the Pearl S. Buck Foundation petitioned the government to help evacuate the various orphans in their facilities in Vietnam. In their book, Silence Broken, Childhelp (International Orphans at the time) founders Sara O'Meara and Yvonne Fedderson chronicle their request from Lieutenant General Lewis William Walt to help with evacuations and finding homes for the Asian-American orphans.
           </p>
           <p>
            Over 2,500 children were relocated and adopted by families in the United States and by its allies.[5] The operation was controversial because there was question about whether the evacuation was in the children's best interest, and because not all the children were orphans
           </p>
           <p>
            When American businessman Robert Macauley learned that it would take more than a week to evacuate the surviving orphans due to the lack of military transport planes, he chartered a Boeing 747 from World Airways and arranged for 300 orphaned children to leave the country, paying for the trip by mortgaging his house.[6]
           </p>
           <p>
            Frederick M. "Skip" Burkle, Jr. served as the medical director of Operation Babylift. He gathered the orphans in Saigon, accompanied them to Clark AFP in the Philippines, and continued to care for them on the Boeing 747 across the Pacific Ocean to Los Angeles.[7]

            Sound familiar?
           </p>
           <p>
            Childhelp offers a variety of services to the children that enter its facilities, professionals in therapy and the community. Over the years the organization has broadened its facilities, incorporated previously established programs and helped bring them to a national audience and educated the public.
           </p>
           <p>
            In 1982, Childhelp started the Childhelp National Child Abuse Hotline
           </p>
           <p>
            Advocacy Centers
           </p>
           <p>
            Childhelp operates three advocacy centers in the U.S. that minimize the trauma to an abused child through condensing the investigative process by housing professionals in law enforcement, child protective services, medicine, mental health and prosecution all under one roof. The child friendly facilities provide an environment far more comfortable than an emergency room or police station for the children.
           </p>
           <p>
            Treatment
           </p>
           <p>
            The first is at two residential treatment centers known as Villages. Both villages, located in rural communities in California and Virginia
           </p>
           <p>
            In 2000, Childhelp founded the Childhelp National Day of Hope.[14] Held in Washington, D.C. on the first Wednesday of April (Child Abuse Prevention Month) every year, the event regularly draws the support and participation of numerous members of the United States Congress.

            So for instance the Dalai Lama search is for all entities with 'Dalai' or 'Lama' in the name? We don't know that they are actually connected to the DL? I looked at a few and the DL himself wasn't named as an officer.

              Yes, the ones found are either 'Dalai' or 'Lama' but not both then. I wouldn't be surprised if it was the DL though, I was just complaining there's no proof.
