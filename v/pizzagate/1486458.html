            Based on my extensive education and research I would have to agree. I didn't assemble all the details but I could see where it was leading. I am not going to watch the vids as I am sure there are some perspectives that I will staunchly disagree with as I try to look at things objectively and logically as I can. I am a serious skeptic and a devout truth seeker, it makes for a very odd combination.

            I knew this had to have something to do with a secret order and all the circumstantial and solid evidence points at the same likely hood that this goes why back. I may account for why Jews were frequently blamed for everything throughout history, you know kinda like your twin brother stealing candy at the store and using your name when he gets caught.
           </p>

            It is good that we understand the nature of these people, Christians, Jews, Hindus, Buddhists etc have all kept their faiths alive thousands of years, youngest being the Christians at about 2000. Disregarding Islam as I think it was a set up by this, shall we call it, Satanic order.

             This group of people is probably 10's of thousands of years old. They created many religions, and pass down their secrets, which the internet has blown open. We live in the "dark age" according to their adherence of the Egyptian/Talmudic zodiac. They fulfill this prophecy, ironically. The NWO is supposed to be a shift into the next age of the zodiac (aligns with procession of Earth).

              I am convinced they created the creationist theory to prevent the majority of researching beyond 6000 years for a reason and I am convince there was a war that lasted more than 4000 years off and on that destroyed a once civilized and modern world.
             </p>
             <p>
              As a child I was working on a theory or two, and researching erosion rates and estimated that Mars rate of erosion was only the result of a few thousand years. My thought is that the education system is deliberately teaching that Mars has been dead for millions of years. By my model, that isn't even plausible.
             </p>
             <p>
              If Mars was dead for 1 million years, it would have begun to break down to the point of structural instability by about 900k years ago. We wouldn't have ever known it as it is. Assuming chunks didn't slam into our planet. This leads me to the theory that who we have been fighting may have been a long detached relative who ended up engaged in war with their home planet.
             </p>
             <p>
              I am basing this on actual archaeological findings as well, which include finding from around the world such as Indian graphics.

                Given the atmospheric conditions, chemistry etc, all hardened substances are prone to erosion, including the stone, granite, etc. Everything erodes! And when I refer to death, I mean core death, lack of fuel as it were, the planet is continuously dropping in core temperature at a very slow rate, that rate will slowly accelerate over time. And like an ice cube thawing, it will crack as the structure destabilizes. The large canyons presently visible are result of old mantles, plate tectonics, no longer growing and expanding, no longer floating on a hot lake of magma like we are.  Just laying like rags on a round sphere.
