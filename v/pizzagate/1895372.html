<p>However we are all new to this game and naive as fuck so indulge me while I do some due diligence. Why? Because there is a remote possibility that the Seth Rich story is a school play:</p>
<p>1) Brother laughing during the family interview. Totally bizarre behavior only matched by the father of a girl &quot;killed&quot; at Sandy Hook laughing as he walked up to the podium where he then proceeded to cry a cry of such anguish it reminded me of the school plays I saw during my time in High School mid to late 1980s. (<em>God I miss the Cold War when at least we understood what the fuck was going on and I was more afraid of &quot;Those Fucking Russians!(tm)&quot; than the psychotic ass clowns in my own government</em>.)</p>
<p>2) Parents live out in Nebraska which has a checkered past for obvious reasons the biggest being the air base out there may be a Mena Arkansas operation on steroids and therefor reduce the credibility of the parents given their ties to it. See George Webb\'s take on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Offutt_Air_Force_Base">Offutt Air Base in Nebraska</a> and yes I know George Webb could be a limited hang out but we\'re spit balling here.</p>
<p>3) I\'ve read there is a theory out there that &quot;Those Fucking Russians!(tm)&quot; were behind Seth Rich\'s murder. The theory being he discovered a Russian hack of the DNC and......please hold your laughter........valiantly tried to alert the authorities but was killed by &quot;Those Fucking Russians!(tm)&quot; before he could get to them.</p>
<p>4) Why was Guccifer 2.0 so over the top and hyper motivated to contact various journalists down in DC like Lee Stranahan who reminds people all the time how he was the first to communicate with Guccifer 2.0. And I\'m not knocking Lee Stranahan but you need to remember this was around the time he left Breitbart and was looking for work and was desperate to get a good story. Maybe TPTB took advantage of his desperation? This is important if TPTB wanted to push the narrative no one leaked the DNC emails and it was a hack by &quot;Those Fucking Russians!(tm)&quot;. </p>
<hr />
<p>So what does this all mean? First please forgive me if I\'m reiterating what\'s been said before here. But what it could mean although it\'s very unlikely is Seth Rich wasn\'t really killed(explains brother laughing) but they needed to make it look like he was so at some later date they could create another &quot;School Play&quot; about Seth discovering a Russian hacker and being killed for it.</p>
<p>Given the past 6 months reading about this shit the Seth Rich as a school play really stands out to me because everything dovetails perfectly. It\'s almost like a the magnum opus of a master furniture maker but it\'s not furniture, it\'s a school play. Anybody do any finish carpentry here and know what dove-tailing means? The thought that goes into making a beautiful piece of furniture is like 5d chess which, ding ding ding, these people love playing.</p>
<hr />
<p>There is one piece of evidence supporting the Seth Rich story as being 100% real as tragic as that is. And that piece of evidence is the chat log supposedly hacked from David Brock around the time of the debates last Fall:</p>
<p><a href="https://steemit.com/david/@anarcho-pirate/david-brock-hacked-on-his-chat-network-6-31-am-google-seth-rich-and-shut-up-about-it">https://steemit.com/david/@anarcho-pirate/david-brock-hacked-on-his-chat-network-6-31-am-google-seth-rich-and-shut-up-about-it</a></p>
<p>If you search the text you\'ll see David Brock uses Seth Rich and what happened to him as a threat and to suggest whatever happened to Seth Rich is what could happen to any Deplorable Shit Lord that got out of line. That chat log seemed pretty over the top and I don\'t know if I trust it. Anybody could have come up with it including &quot;Those Fucking Russians!(tm)&quot; who might want to make it look like they didn\'t murder Seth Rich but someone at Killary &amp; Co did.</p>
<hr />
<p>Anyway that\'s it. This is related to Pizzagate because Seth Rich\'s nickname was &quot;The Panda Bear&quot; and the fact CPP may have been another one of these school plays so it helps in understanding how they\'re done.</p>
<p>What does everyone think?</p>
<p>P.S.</p>
<p>(<em>And I\'m not saying Alefantis has been 100% exonerated. He\'s at about 90% because CPP was a psy-op but Alefantis is involved in other things as well outside of CPP.</em>)</p>',

            What bothers me about the Brock chat is that there was only one "hacked".  Perhaps it was a one off - emergency situation.

            Could one of Seth's parents have escaped being a slave of one of the elites? Then working with another mole inside the Clinton/DNC cabal Seth got access to those files. 
None of this Seth Rich story being reported as it has by his family, media ect... Makes any sense!
Now, a FL prosecutor is found murdered, also looking into  "voter fraud" 
Not buying it!
Voter fraud is nothing new! Visa fraud is nothing new! The fucks have been doing this for years.

             I'm fairly certain they're being truthful. I wasn't this morning but did more research and I'm now almost positive Seth Rich was the leaker and he was killed for it.

              The three B's  Bribe, blackmail or bury.  Why go straight to the bury?  He was offered a job with DNC(?) days before, so it looks like they tried the bribe.   Unless it was to send a message.

            The clincher for me was wikileaks posting the chat logs of Guccifer2.0 where he stated his source was 'seth'. No warning or notice like what happened today for example. Though the motivations of all organisations including wikileaks are to be scrutinised heavily, could have been a co worker that leaked and they are providing cover by leading the scent away.

            Also to note im pretty sure G2.0 was Kimdotcom, would explain him enjoying the moment in the sun so much and clearly having a hard on for some celebs.

            Its really quite simple. When they (CIA/Clintons) lose control of the narrative or information, they kill people or arrest them. That is why the Clinton body count is so high and it has been going on for years. Only in this case the emails were all released online and they can't kill all of us although I think they would have started a Russia/nuclear war as a means if they could have.

            It seems there is a little misunderstanding of what "a school Play" entails within CIA/FBI. The script is written ahead of time and the actors (assasins) are chosen, the set up is determined (Joe Capone, bar owner gets called in to whitehouse given instructions &amp; meets with Bob Creamer) doctors (willing to sign off on death certificates/DNC donors) are prepared, crisis actors (DC police willing to play ball) are lined up, and so on. Then the play happens. Seth is killed there is an autopsey report but his death was an orchestrated school Play where all roles were written ahead of time.
           </p>

            That is the point. By the way CPP is not a psyop it was not supposed to be discovered. It is just a part of the overall picture of evil. What was found inside CPP was secret login sites to live child rape/torture.

            Alefantis is a CIA asset as is the majority of D.C. including John Podesta, Barry O. The whole town is a bunch of Satanic pedos.

              Yes very much so. But it starred Seth Rich as the leaker. The others wrote the play. Seth Rich was murdered the School Play was the elaborate play and cover up of his murder.

              Many are coming forward to confess because they want this to stop. We the people must demand the truth. Recall the losers. Vote in new members of congress. Many on here will Rimini for office.

             Like most Americans, you overestimate the power that the CIA have and completely forget that Langley is the just the hammer. You underestimate the power that the Crown and the City of London still has over the plantation - AKA the US.

                Always know that is true :). But you have to stop the bleeding and G.W.  &amp; J. G. are doing that.  You might be surprised who is who in the end. The play just had it's next scene by the way. As stated in my first post here 9 hours ago all the players mentioned are involved.

                 It is beginning to look like they lost the war and infiltrated the victors - perhaps lesson learned from losing the first war.  We could be at best of three.

                  British MI do not report to Germans. They are not even part of 5 eyes. Those are the five English speaking countries that have a super secret pact...partially because we all speak predominately English.

                  Great Britain will never never relinquish that power unless forced. They are the heartbeat of all financial power City of London. M16 was instrumental in putting Hitler into power as was OSS (now CIA) Allen Dulles.

             So if I am understanding this correctly. The Alphabet agencies think they are directing/writing a script? Then act it out? 
Ok, so is the target(Seth Rich) really killed? 
Or are you just saying that like most premeditated killings it was thought out ahead of time.

             I think CPP was a "red-herring" and more precisely a virtual "Claymore Mine". I wrote about it here:

              Yes. I read this when you first wrote it

              . I also have watched the Circada 3301 puzzle and especially "the Outer Dark" youtube decoding of the clues. The depth of knowledge needed to understand the clues much less decide this was unbelievable. The amount of biblical prophesy and occulult iconography that lead directly to current events was a mind blow.

              I understand your questioning here. If Great Britain is the lion was Manchester the roar as predicted? Is that what you are saying?

              My two cents. CPP is both what it looks to be and a psyop, a psiop used as a weapon against HRC mafia. By who? Who knows. Could've even been the Russians.  I do think there is some sort of war going on in the upper echelons and keyword "pizza" was a psi info strike which had some very real info it, real enough that the current establishment had to resort to massive amounts of editing and omission to diffuse the story enough for gen pop consumption, but in doing so further damaged the ability of MSM and IC to maintain orthodox narrative. Further spec: I know you follow Webb. I do too. Personally, I don't think it was an accident that Where's Eric Braverman? and PG investigations lined up so nicely. If there was never a PG, I don't think Webb's series would have taken off like it has since PG was the hook--the hey look over here (here not just being the pizza shop but the CF, history  of pedos in DC, and all the kid porn, mkultra trauma art and symbolism, and strange clinton pizza party type sites and accts that were everywhere on the internet once you knew how to find it) while Webb provided the context and rational or utility of SRA ( blackmail and the creation of apathy) in the ratline biz. Sort of a yin/yang kind of thing. Also, this theory seemed more plausible to me after reading Gwen's correspondence with webb. He talked about the whole fresh air, clean water tactic of russia's following the fall of the union to counteract the US's big 6. If any of what I'm saying is true, which it likely isn't, it'd be an ingenious truth bombing campaign, ingenious since how are you supposed to retaliate when the bombs are of your own making?

               I understand your skepticism regarding George Webb. I picked up on him steering the story away from Pizzagate and Jeffrey Epstein too. But that has an obvious explanation and that is George Webb himself is putting on a "school play" for Mossad.

              <p>
               And that's not a bad thing at all. I strongly suspect what happened is the CIA and Mossad had a falling out over:

                I'm not really skeptical about what he's doing or why he's doing it, for the most part, and think he's only helped validate what's going on with PG. Just think there's a lot of details out of frame about all of this.  But regardless of what I can see or can't see, the effects I think are a good thing. I also think there there are people in positions of power in both organizations that  have a conscience or at least realize there's a limit to the rational of "playing" in the grey to control the black--mainly when there's no grey anymore, just black.

               I knew you were poorly educated but not this poorly educated. Why am I surprised.

               Islam means surrender in Arabic. Go find an Arabic person and ask them and then come back here and apologize for being a fucking idiot.

                Sensing a pattern whereby you simply repeat what you heard someone say without  looking it up yourself, LOL!
               </p>
               <p>
                Islam is commonly translated as "submission" which is a voluntary act not comparable to "surrender."
               </p>
               <p>
                Furthermore "islam" means the act of formally becoming a muslim, nothing else. You cant use it to describe people lubing their assholes and submitting to the rule of a Jewish elite, the word for which is of course "darkmathing"

                 That's bull shit. You can voluntarily surrender to a lot of things. Just last night I surrendered to my desire for
                 <a href="http://www.foodrepublic.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/whatchamacallit_mixcheeseandfish.jpg">
                  Lobster Thermidor.
                 </a>
                </p>
                <p>
                 Then I surrendered to my desire for Apple Crisp with a dollop of Vanilla Ice Cream.
                </p>
                <p>
                 Last month I finally surrendered to the idea Kale is actually a legitimate vegetable usable in any number of dishes and is not a mere garnishment under a dolop of Potato Salad at a July 4th barbecue like the one coming up down in DC this summer.
                </p>
                <p>
                 I don't think Hillary will taste like chicken bee tee dubs. I'm gonna go with pork for now.
                </p>
                <p>
                 How about you? What do you think she'll taste like?

                     Well you'll be happy to learn based on the new information that came out today that Seth Rich was really murdered by the Killary &amp; Co for being the DNC leaker.

                         I share your frustration but if you could just stop insulting me for a second and listen for once maybe I can help you with your frustration. Ready? Good, here goes:
                        </p>
                        <p>
                         Of course the Seth Rich story is bull shit and not even close to addressing the real crimes these mother fuckers have gotten caught doing like the child rape etc ad nauseum.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                         But you can't lead with the worst crimes. You have to gradually ease people into the story so they don't lose their fucking minds. The crimes the Deep State committed are so fucking horrible I believe Trump will have to place troops along all roads leading into DC. And I'm not fucking joking.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                         Put yourself in the shoes of a Combat Veteran. When they learn they fought and saw their friends die for nothing more than to get the 1100 donors to the Clinton Foundation rich all hell is going to break lose. There are probably 100,000 combat veterans involved in Iraq and Afghanistan living in American today. I can guarantee 1% of those will lose their fucking minds and try and kill any Congressman or woman that was guilty of aiding and abetting this thing.

            </p>
            <p>
             Yep. I totally agree. George Webb himself is a school play I suspect. The one consolation about George Webb though is if he's a school play then he's Mossad. And if he's Mossad and spilling the fuck-ton of dirty laundry he's found on Killary &amp; Co then you can be sure there's a valid reason.
            </p>
            <p>
             And what is that reason? I think the CIA and Mossad had a bit of a falling out. I think the CIA started getting too cozy with the Muslim Brotherhood and that freaked out Mossad so they turned state's evidence.
            </p>
            <p>
             That certainly doesn't exonerate Mossad as Jeffrey Epstein and his ever shrinking bank account will tell you. But it could be taken as a sign of a 90 degree turn in the business of getting dirt on politicians and padding black budgets with illicit drug sales.
            </p>
            <p>
             But who the fuck knows at this point. All I know is Hillary Clinton very much looks like either Satan or a man calling himself Satan. This is exactly what Satan would do. He'd come to earth as a 70+ year old grandmother that no one would suspect of being so evil.

               Maybe but my take on it is once ISIS proved incapable of taking over Syria they became a liability for obvious reasons.
              </p>
              <p>
               If I were Jewish and living in Israel and worked for Mossad I could understand their rational for helping start ISIS with help from the Deep State, Qatar and the Saudis. Syria has been fucking with Israel since 1948. That's a long time. Israel beat them countless times but Syria was an open soar that wouldn't heel. Mossad sent in ISIS to repay 60+ years of Syrian attacks. Even though Assad still runs Syria he has no country left. It'll be a hundred years before Syria can threaten Israel again.
              </p>
              <p>
               After ISIS got kicked to the curb Mossad shuts down a bunch of programs and then "goes to the mattresses". Mossad and Saudi Arabia are going to be lying low for a bit. The analogy I think of is Bill Murray in the last scene of Caddyshack where he's just blown up half the golf course and scurries away covering his face so no one recognizes him:

              I don't see him spilling the beans on the real perps, in fact Webb has stated he doesn't believe Podesta or Clinton, any high ups involved in pizzagate, should receive jail time. He does however go after Muslims. He's supposedly our man on the ground with regard to the Seth Rich case, yet he's doing videos about Pakistan (he does 10 a day, it's really hard to pinpoint any of his actions, sneaky fella). Meanwhile he's not doing the obvious things, like calling the coroners office to see if an autopsy was performed on Seth.

               that is not what he is saying. He wants them to go to jail he just does not want it to fall short at Podesta or even HRC &amp; not root out the deeper the problem. The whole CIA, the corrupt FBI, the corrupt political system, money laundering, organ harvesting, all of it. He is afraid they will sacrifice a big name like Podesta like they did Hastert or Lawrance King for financial crimes and it would get covered up.
              </p>
              <p>
               That is what he is after and he will not stop until they all go. Give him credit. You are fighting the wrong battle. Start researching all the names he and his journalist partners &amp; fellow whistleblowers JASON Goodman, 
Sibel Edmonds, &amp; Cynthia McKinney Phd drop. That is right he is a federal whistleblower who has been tormented &amp; gangstaulked if you are not aware. His crime initially coming to the aid of a Muslim kid who was being wrongfully targeted by the current deputy FBI director Andrew McCabe who took a bribe of $700,000 from Clinton donor while in charge of her email investigation.

               So before you continue to assail George's character you should learn what motivated him in the beginning. Taking a stand against the FBI will get you placed in a Disrupt program. You will be hunted, your life and relationships ruined. Your assets seized for no lawful reason. Home burglarized repeatedly often times by prowler teams while you are sleeping. It is tormenting and never ending. Many people committ suicide once placed in these programs. Research Gary Webb.

               George has been fighting back not 7 years and went all in last October knowing it was do or die. He has a son that just graduated medical school and was safe and off on his own. George sent FOIA requests to FBI, CIA, NSA, Homeland Security, local police and had it all posted on line as part of a dead mans switch request indications he had no history with any of them.
              </p>
              <p>
               He then posted his first video giving his full name, DOB, and current address and indicating he had deadman switch info in place should someone choose to take his life. The first videos he showed parts of were real organ harvesting procedures happening against young Syrian children where they were gutted and organs crudely harvested from their bodies. He also showed many other horrors of was including horrid child sex crimes. 
He was in danger constantly but has kept at it attempting to expose this evil. I for one think he is a brace hero. There is death threats against him daily. I will stand by him and provide support or go down swinging.

               I'm pretty sure he did do that and found out no autopsy was preformed which means either Seth wasn't killed or he was murdered and it was covered up.

                 It looks like Seth Rich was taken to the Howard University Hospital:

                <p>
                 They might have the autopsy report but I'd be surprised since the parents weren't in DC at the time yet were able to sign the organ donor card.
                </p>
                <p>
                 I think you need to cut George Webb some slack here. If the CIA and Mossad and possibly other Intel Services have had a falling out then you can be pretty sure the people feeding George this information know their shit.
                </p>
                <p>
                 George Webb is looking more and more like the mouthpiece of Mossad and possibly MI6 and maybe French Intel.
                </p>
                <p>
                 I think the CIA finally pissed off so many people they're getting taken down. The CIA and Killary killed Extortion 17 and 8,985 Seals will go on the war path if nothings done to find the killers. Never piss off 8,985 highly trained assassins.

                  That made sense to me from the very beginning but it could not be verified.  I know that there was a hard push for us to think it was a hospital with a trauma center.  Trauma Centers are for those that they want to keep alive.  News Flash.  They did not care if he died, when he did not they killed him.  I would research also if Howard U. Hosp. is set up for organ harvesting.  It could be.  One clue is if it is under one umbrella of a Medical Group.  Usually there are quite a few hospitals in a large city under a group, for example, Tenet Healthcare and others.

                 Without trying to be snide but you're welcome to do your own research. Maybe call the hospital and find out if there actually is an autopsy report for Seth Rich.

                   LOL! You mean you're complaining about being told to search his videos for some piece of information when that's exactly what you and your cohorts told me to do when I questioned the veracity of your bogus claims that Webb said Clinton and Podesta should go scot-free?

                   You and your cohorts have no limits to your hypocrisy. Do you know what a hypocrite is? It's someone who has one set of rules, expectations, and values for everyone else, but does not believe they are bound to these same rules, expectation, and values. You sir, are a hypocrite of an extraordinary kind.

               Still waiting some ten days for any shred of evidence that Webb ever said he believes JP or HRC should not receive jail time. Produce the video, or accept the fact that casual readers will assume you made it up. Could this involve some effort on your part? Sure, just divert some of that time you spend attacking Jones, Webb, and others to finding the video, so you can substantiate at least one of your wild claims, which now includes the idea that Seth Rich is still alive.

            I agree, I'm 95% certain as well. The one almost insignificant coincidence​ I can't reconcile is, pandas for Bernie was not Seth rich. If Seth started liking pandas because he liked Bernie, and pandas represented Bernie, that I could understand.  But apparently Seth's love for pandas is lifelong.  So these two great Bernie supporters were also both big panda fans.  It's a small detail, to be sure, but I'm stuck on it anyway.

              The "pandas for Bernie" group also liked pandas. I still think it's too coincidental that two unrelated Bernie supporters used pandas as their mascot, so to speak.
             </p>
             <p>
              I believe when many coincidences take place, it's either because of poor design (which means not a natural occurrence) by someone who is not very smart (if they were smart we wouldn't notice them), or we were supposed to find the coincidences and start asking questions.
             </p>
             <p>
              Either way, we need to know when we're being manipulated or handled or misdirected.  Or tricked into a trap by someone's agenda.

                Most of us expected Bernie's pandas and Seth's pandas to be the same pandas. But it turns out they were completely separate, non-related, pandas.
               </p>
               <p>
                I thought maybe Seth liked pandas because they represented Bernie and he liked Bernie. But in an article I read, a college friend mentioned Seth loved pandas during their school time together.  I'm presuming that was pre-bernie. So Seth didn't choose pandas as his spirit animal because of Bernie's affinity for the animal.  And I doubt that the Bernie group chose pandas because of their admiration for Seth rich. Therefore they are completely unrelated. Which makes it a coincidence.

            I agree with you that CPP is a psyop, Alefantis is Cia and he does procure kids for  diplomats, but it is not run put of comet ping pongs basement. That is what msm always says pizzagate is about and that it is debunked. They fabricated that it was all about a ring in the basement of ping pong to dismiss it. That is why Alex Jones had to redact his statements. Great post, strange going ons and I don't understand the Rich family yet or Seth Rich's death. How did his death get headlined again, was it forced by deep state or was it gtass roots. Is Seth Rich alive or was he killed for his contacts with wikileaks.

            Interesting thoughts.  Ok if we are going to go out on this limb, perhaps the Rep/Dem show, the Trump/Hillary show, the whole ball of wax, is to keep us distracted while the elites are working on their escape from the planet they trashed...the breakaway civilization would be search words for this theory.  Sometimes I wonder.
But it is good to look for devious plans within plans.  KArl Rove was the master of those and escaped what seemed to be a certain perp walk.  I believe he was behind the clever plan to trash Dan Rather.  WHere is he these days

            Good question. Oh I know. How about we each explain how CPP was a psyop to distract from a possible crime a billion times worse involving a certain group of elite Art buyers:

             Seriously though I don't mind. We're spit balling here. I've never played 5d chess before. I'm not sure I could even get my own name right at this point.

              Maybe later I'll give a more detailed opinion but its pretty late for me right now so I'm too tired to put in the effort.  Maybe if I remember tomorrow.

              Good to see you take it so well.  A lot of people get offended, but saying something is retarded is pretty standard language where I'm from.   Its used for a wide range of things, from insults, to just 'nah I don't agree."

            If it was just a play. Why so much suppression of anyone who reports on SR to the masses? If ccp was a psyop, why risk the exposure to the entire game if it was just to get a few names out there.
           </p>
           <p>
            I can agree much of what the CIA does is just theater for the masses but you can also tell when they get caught with their dick out. And their dick is out. Ccp, Washington post, podesta, clintons, alefantis, mccain, much of the gop and dnc, and more, are all CIA assets and employees. It's the only way no has been caught before and the only reason they are not in jail now.

              Interestingly, after the 2013 NDAA was passed and the ban on domestic propaganda was removed, it's hard to know what's true. Do we have good evidence the Portland thing really happened? (I haven't been keeping up)

               Nothing more than the killer looking bat shit crazy. Who knows, if I had to guess I'd say he's for real. This is what happens when the Deep State does fake terror. Real people end up getting hurt.

               And unfortunately when the truth finally comes out the last people "hurt" will be in the Deep State.

            I watched the "suspicious" video of the parents, and the only thing that seemed a bit off was the brother, and that could easily just be someone who is not used to being on camera.  What some people are interpreting as him stifling a laugh looks to me like he thinks he has to force a smile because he's on camera.
           </p>
           <p>
            The Dad mouthing what the Mom is going to say is not suspect to me at all, because it is completely normal to rehearse an interview.

             Who would tell him to force a smile in that situation? It's basically a wake. When people are taken pictures of at a funeral does the photographer make sure to tell people to smile?

            Those are some good points. But, how could you think the Comet Ping Pong one is a psyop? James Alefantis only became big after we found that he had a connection with the Podestas, David Brock and all those other freaks. James Alefantis' social media, art, bands and friends all led to how sick and depraved these people are. None of that can be denied because there is stuff on Alefantis going back for years.
           </p>
           <p>
            We can't deny that Alefantis was also the boyfriend of Brock, that he's spent time in the White House, hangs with the Podestas and that whole circle. This couldn't have all been planted. A basement under Comet Ping Pong may be wrong. Is that what you mean? Who knows where children are held. But, I think there is a lot of evidence that shows Alefantis himself is part of something much bigger.

             That's why I said on CPP is a psy-op. All the other stuff points to some really sketchy stuff that could possibly be far worse like this for example:

              LOL, and maybe I don't try to be "clever" with my deletions because
              <em>
               I'm not trying to hide anything
              </em>
              .  Just a thought.

            Hi im darkmath, my submissions consist of summarizing youtube videos of ex CIA jews with my own analysis like anyone gives a shit what i think. Alefantis was exonerated, and in fact, pizza isnt even a codeword.  God how i wish i were as young and attractive as DonKeyhote.

             Pizza isn't even a code word? James Alefantis has been exonerated? There hasn't even been an investigation 🙄 How much does Media Matters pay?

             You're getting laid? Holy fuck. How does that work? Women tend to steer clear of neo-Nazis or at least I thought they did. Tell me more about how you're meeting these women. This has all the ingredients of a great story.

             DarkMath lies down on his belly on the braided rug in front of the fireplace and props his head up with his two hands as he looks up at his Uncle who's been sitting in his Dad's easy chair since coming over to babysit. DarkMath's feet slowly kick up and down as his Uncle DonKeyhote holds story time in front of the fire place.

              Well it was a rainy night so i sought refuge in a nearby tavern. Immediately i observed a corpulent, obnoxious wench who had clearly overindulged.
             </p>
             <p>
              Sensing oppprtunity, i finished my ale and muttered to no one in particular, "bullseye."
             </p>
             <p>
              But the rotten fruit of that regrettable union would later haunt me, for while i successfully evaded monetary support payments to the vile whore, the boy born, to my great shame, without testicles, ended up shilling for Jewish homosexuals who hate America.

               That's great Don, you're a pig fucker. I must admit I've indulged in "pig flesh" on more than one occasion.
