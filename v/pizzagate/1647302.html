            I'm very thankful for the interview that he did with me on his channel. I think it made many people more open to the fact PizzaGate is real. I don't like to be classed as the "PizzaGate survivor". However I am a survivor of satanic ritual abuse and trafficking. I know what these children have to endure and suffer. 
I thank everyone that is exposing PizzaGate. Not just for myself but for other survivors and victims too

            I'm so sorry Kinglover.  You're very brave.   I can't listen to the tapes of Podesta? shouting at the little girl.  It would upset me too much and make me feel ill.

             Someone sent me a link to that on twitter with out telling me what it was. Stupidly, I clicked on it. Thankfully I only watched a few seconds of the video but that was enough. Disgusting. Podesta and the rest of the PizzaGate pedophiles need to go to jail

            Thank you for posting this, Piscina. I have recently become concerned for the safety of any SRA victims who may be reading the site. I recently came across this speech given by Dr. D. Corydon Hammond in 1992:
           </p>
           <p>
            <a href="http://www.bibliotecapleyades.net/sociopolitica/esp_sociopol_mindcon03.htm">
             http://www.bibliotecapleyades.net/sociopolitica/esp_sociopol_mindcon03.htm
            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            It's been posted here a couple of times. It is a MUST READ.
           </p>
           <p>
            The name of the speech is very specific, as the name is a part of MKULTRA/Monarch programming. It is one of the names of the Dr famous for creating mind control. The name is planted deep within the alter system and acts as a "killswitch" if the therapist is able to get to that level with the patient. I've seen the name in post titles and there is someone who recently joined who has it for their Voat name. My concern is that it might possibly be a trigger or could be used as a warning to SRA survivors to keep silent &amp; not tell their stories (or worse). I think we all should be very mindful of keeping our entire community safe, including all who may have suffered abuse.

            Thank you this was back in October, maybe it was nothing, but her post about JW's reminded me of the two incidents. All i have ever done is lurk and ocasionaly comment. In retrospect, it's weird but then 
Again maybe ina just being paranoid. Thank you god bless as well.

            All this talk of ritual abuse makes me think of the "therapeutical youth programs" that I am sure are still around today, but were very prominent in the 90's and early 2000's (up until around '07 when more light was shed).
           </p>
           <p>
            Long story short, there were tons of youth programs (residential units) modeled off of the CEDU platform.  CEDU  (Charles E. Dederich University) was a therapeuitcal program started in Southern California.  It is alleged to have been developed out of Synanon.   For those of you that don't know about Synanon and Charles Dederich, a google search is all you need to learn about the behavior mod cult.
           </p>
           <p>
            The program I was held in was located in Montana, and I know they were prevalent in Montana, Idaho, and Utah, maybe more.   From personal experience I can tell you there was serious ritual abuse.   The abuses were on a scale from "minor" things like food and sleep deprivation (I only say minor because of the extremity of other abuses) to extreme things such as sexual and physical abuse.  Kids disappeared, never to be seen again.  It was rumored they were killed for saving information and trying to get it out (all communication was monitored and mostly prevented), or abducted for far more sinister purposes.
           </p>
           <p>
            Most staff had SERIOUS interest in the sexual experiences of students (with an emphasis on wanting to hear about stories of rape, etc.), and crossed boundaries of physical contact BLATANTLY IN THE OPEN. This stuff wasn't even hidden behind closed doors.  They used psychology and behavior modification to make kids think it was normal and okay.
           </p>
           <p>
            For me, this nightmare lasted two entire years until I turned 16.   And the after effects continue to this day.   Even as I write this I shake.  I have dealt with constant PTSD (I had already experienced ritual abuse when I was forced into the program, but it got far worse), insomnia, and a seeming impossibility to trust anyone or anything.   I have even been called a sociopath by a doctor who did not understand that when you experience something like this, you no longer experience things like emotions in the way a "normal" person does.
           </p>
           <p>
            If anyone wants more information, I am happy to share.   There were very well documented efforts by wealthy people (including the man who owned the program I was held at) who spent millions lobbying against the creation of a Montana state board to monitor youth programs.   Some time around 2007 legislation finally passed, and it seems things have gotten better.     I am not sure how this all relates, but just wanted to share.

            Its often more than PTSD. In my view, its more often a full blown MPD that was triggered through extreme abuse. It can be very difficult to help or get information from people when one of their aspects is monitoring and waiting to step in and take over if you get too close to any real information. It can also make them extremely difficult in maintaining a strong chain of evidence.

             Yes, they're likely to have more than one issue; it's comorbidity.  But it's not for me to put labels on survivors.  Only they can talk of the consequences and how the abuse has affected them.   And yes, if they're triggered, one of their aspects may come forward.

            My mother was a psychiatric nurse at the height of the SRA scandal that subsequently turned into "fake memories"...there were a whole lot of victims at that time.  Her take, after hearing the stories, meeting the people and being involved in the therapy sessions, was that the victims were legit and telling the truth.
           </p>
           <p>
            She wrote off the "fake memories" push as a measure to decrease expenses on the part of insurers...which is a constant in healthcare, however; we know that it was different fuckery afoot.   In fact, funding for psychiatric care pretty much dried up after this, forcing her to go into home health care.
EDIT:  I will ask her again about the whole time period..it has been years since we talked about it...I would like to hear the details again.  WIll report back with anything interesting.

             False memory proponents where in bed with pedos orgs in the 80's-90's. Some of these shrinks were pedos themselves and Satanists Some were CIA. I will try to find linkies. I am a survivor of SRA and have studied this topic for 2 decades.

              Castlewood Treatment Center in Ballwin Mo. for Drug and Eating Disorders.  The therapist there, Mark Schwartz is being sued for brainwashing his patients.  Quite a few patients have come out and said that they are having Satanic Ritual Nightmares.  They have no recollection of these things happenings and are horrified.  I truthfully believe they were either MK Ultra or Project Monarch or other mind control and these things really did happen.  We shall see what happens when the cases go to court.  Highly suspicious.  Actually this ties in with other things that are going on in St. Louis and St. Charles County Mo.  with the Archdiocese and organ and sex trafficking.  You can;t make this stuff up.  It writes it;s own story.  The SRA is horrid.

               Maybe they are suing him because they can't accept the horrible reality of the abuse they survived, and they want to believe it was brainwashing  ???

               Sounds like MK-Ultra or similar for sure. And likely he is a Satanist himself. Probably doing rituals on his patients (with a Coven or Cult) then mind controlling them into forgetting.  Or he is working with Gov in secret project like MK-Ultra. Or both. Some cult member higher ups are CIA or other Gov. like military, (think Michael Aquino of Temple of Set), this is why they are often so adept at brainwashing &amp; mind control techniques.. CIA has infiltrated some Secret Societies for a while now.  Will have to check out this case. Very interesting.

              Posted this orginally in the wrong place:
              <br/>
              All this talk of ritual abuse makes me think of the "therapeutical youth programs" that I am sure are still around today, but were very prominent in the 90's and early 2000's (up until around '07 when more light was shed).
             </p>
             <p>
              Long story short, there were tons of youth programs (residential units) modeled off of the CEDU platform. CEDU (Charles E. Dederich University) was a therapeuitcal program started in Southern California. It is alleged to have been developed out of Synanon. For those of you that don't know about Synanon and Charles Dederich, a google search is all you need to learn about the behavior mod cult.
             </p>
             <p>
              The program I was held in was located in Montana, and I know they were prevalent in Montana, Idaho, and Utah, maybe more. From personal experience I can tell you there was serious ritual abuse. The abuses were on a scale from "minor" things like food and sleep deprivation (I only say minor because of the extremity of other abuses) to extreme things such as sexual and physical abuse. Kids disappeared, never to be seen again. It was rumored they were killed for saving information and trying to get it out (all communication was monitored and mostly prevented), or abducted for far more sinister purposes.
             </p>
             <p>
              Most staff had SERIOUS interest in the sexual experiences of students (with an emphasis on wanting to hear about stories of rape, etc.), and crossed boundaries of physical contact BLATANTLY IN THE OPEN. This stuff wasn't even hidden behind closed doors. They used psychology and behavior modification to make kids think it was normal and okay.
             </p>
             <p>
              For me, this nightmare lasted two entire years until I turned 16. And the after effects continue to this day. Even as I write this I shake. I have dealt with constant PTSD (I had already experienced ritual abuse when I was forced into the program, but it got far worse), insomnia, and a seeming impossibility to trust anyone or anything. I have even been called a sociopath by a doctor who did not understand that when you experience something like this, you no longer experience things like emotions in the way a "normal" person does.
             </p>
             <p>
              If anyone wants more information, I am happy to share. There were very well documented efforts by wealthy people (including the man who owned the program I was held at) who spent millions lobbying against the creation of a Montana state board to monitor youth programs. Some time around 2007 legislation finally passed, and it seems things have gotten better. I am not sure how this all relates, but just wanted to share.

            I'm person with several family members who have made SRA claims and I can tell you this... its a very hard situation. Its hard to hear about it, its hard to believe even coming from trusted family members. I know these things have not been talked about in my family in quite a few years, its just not something you can bring up and if they dont want to talk about it then there isn't much one can do. If you know someone who has suffered from SRA just listen if they want to talk. They know most people are going to dismiss them so whatever you do dont show skepticism (even if thats how you feel). Its only going to make them feel worse.

              Edit: Posted this before but got taken down. Just copy past as a response to commontruthseekers question.
             </p>
             <p>
              Okay so this may not be super relevant to this sub but I wanted to post it and let you all decide and ask me questions if you want.
             </p>
             <p>
              When I was around 12 (this was the late 80's early 90's) my father had a nervous break down and was essentially bed ridden for a few months. He started going to a therapist and eventually came forward with the claim that he and all of his sisters (5) in total had been ritualistically abused for years at the hands of his step father and a ring of abusers that he seemed to think had ties to free masons. These memory's he claimed had been repressed and only surfaced via therapy sessions. He approached his siblings some of whom corroborated this story. Eventually the whole group met at our house some of them flying in from across the country and sat down to talk about what they all knew or thought had happened. Eventually all of them came to the conclusion that it was real and they talked about the details at length. I am only privy to a very small amount of the details as I was young and telling me about exactly what they said they went though was deemed not appropriate by my family.
             </p>
             <p>
              What I know: 1)Sexual abuse and physical abuse including rape, cutting, and beating.
             </p>
             <p>
              2)Several of my aunts claim to have been impregnated and had the baby aborted or carried to term and taken away.
             </p>
             <p>
              3)Some of them reported the abusers had "non human faces" (I take this to mean they wore masks but take from it what you will) and some drawings were produced by a few of them. What I saw seemed to show people with overly large eyes and or horns, also dog like faces.
             </p>
             <p>
              4)The abusers performed some sort of rituals during the abuse that all the victims now consider satanic in nature.
             </p>
             <p>
              5)The step father in question had abandoned the family years before these revelations and no one seemed to be able to track him down or even confirm if he was still living.
             </p>
             <p>
              After they had "the meeting" They confronted their mother (my grandmother) who they all had a good relationship with about this and she claimed to have no knowledge of any of it. This was a bit a of a wedge for the family for quite a few years though it seems it blew over as she aged and eventually passed away.
             </p>
             <p>
              You may notice I have used the word claimed in the description and that is because myself and the rest of the family were always highly skeptical of all of this. It has only been in the last few years that I have come to be less skeptical due to my personal research into SRA and child abuse in general. Truth be told I still don't know what to think. The subject has not been spoken of in my family for many years. I myself have no memory of abuse outside of what I would call mild physical and psychological abuse by my father for a brief period before his mental break down. I also knew this step father (my step grandfather) when I was very young and I have only fond memories. The only other thing of note is that portions of the family had been involved with Jehovah's witnesses off and on since at least the 70s. My parents are currently members of the JW church, I am not.
             </p>
             <p>
              Feel free to ask me questions but I have given the information I have as far as I can recall.

               This is very interesting and I want to say when pizzagate first was revealed early on i was following it very closely, simply lurking mind you.  I had 2 strange incidents. One a white van showed up and parked directly in front of my house. It was jehovs witnesses but they only came to my house. I did not open the door and told them trough an open window from the second floor that I was a believer and to keep fighting the god fight. I promptly notified the police and when they arrived they left. They kind of  walked around outside loitering. The jokes about being v&amp;s were not lost on me. Also another jehovas witness showed up covered in tatoos and piercings telling me she was overcoming her fear of public speaking and wouldn't I agree that public speaking was scary.  That she was terrified to speak in public and shouldn't I be? Well I promptly closed the door and thought am I being paranoid? I wrote it off at the time: So who knows but the jehovas witness connection may need to be explored.

                I know all about JW's so ask away. I would say on the surface most of them are harmless and not much different from your average bible thumper. However they are into that whole cover up molestation thing for sure. They consider it a sin between god and the sinner and actively protect molesters. They also do this pretty nasty confession type thing for people who end up cheating in their marriage or have sex outside marriage. Basically a group of "elders" (old men) take the offender into a back room and force them to tell all the details of what happened. I have several female ex JW friends who experienced this and it was the reason they left the church. I wouldn't peg the organization as pedos personally but they deffinatly have some twisted ideas about whats okay and what isnt.
               </p>
               <p>
                Interesting about the tattooed person.. JW's are deeply against body modification so that doesn't fit. If a person had lots of tattoos they could still join but any piercings outside ear for woman would not be allowed for an active member. Something fishy with that encounter.

                 I now wonder about all of that but it seems so far fetched I will admit at the time it really made me paranoid. I am truly so technology inept all I do is pray and downvoat or upvoat. Pretty much. It was really weird. And your post brought it back to mind. They may pretend to be JWs in order to approach vulnerable families....who knows this is so speculative.

                  As a former member of JW I can tell you with out question that on one would be allowed to "witness" the term they use for going door to door if they had body modifications outside earrings for women. Even then I recall issues with women having more than one ear piercing they considered that questionable. DO NOT let a person looking like that claiming to be JW into your home. JW's will be well dressed not black and while like LDS but humble dress clothes for sure. As a rule dont invite any strangers in imo.

              I know some things but nothing I would call evidence. I actually made a post about it a while back that got taken down because not directly related to pizzagate and thats cool there has to be some order here. let me see maybe I can just copy past that old comment to you so you can read it.

            Good point. We know how dangerous this is, this is the GIANT secret that they, the scum elite, do not want coming out. It is probably the main reason they have tried so hard to discredit pizzagate! The amount of people involved in this is staggering. Many of us have tried for years to get this out there but it is their most guarded secret. Keep in mind also that after the children(usually starts around 3 years old) become adults they often have no idea they have alters. We are dealing with people that may have Delta programming(assassin) and can be violent to others and to themselves with no recollection.

              Read this before and much of this is what I believe. The quantum hologram is something I find amazing. I still have a hard time understanding what child abuse, ritual abuse has to do with this other than dark forces inhabiting humans that want to drink or harvest the fluids from children to extend their lives. Harvesting that fear is also hard to comprehend. I also wonder about the theory that we are batteries to certain beings

                Agreed so then, is it not possible that some of us are targeted for whatever reason? Is it because we are vibrating on a higher level and that they feel we threaten their control?
With the children, so sad to even entertain the notion, but that they are simply an energy source?

             Seaman is good at getting the message out.  But instead of really listening to Becki, asking her questions and following her head, he was too busy thinking of what he was going to say next and using every possible opportunity to push the agenda.  Yes, push your agenda but not at the expense of victims.

              To be honest I didn't watch his interview.  What you say doesn't surprise me.  Seaman will eventually harm us.  He's immature and not professional, though he constantly calls himself a journalist. On twitter, he's now calling himself a 'thought leader'.  'nuf said.
