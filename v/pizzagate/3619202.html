In the song &quot;What\'s Beef?&quot; Biggie says C-Gutta is a child rapist and murderer who sodomizes children and throws them off bridges. Gutta was released from prison in 2017 after doing 16 years for firing at Capone of the group Capone N Noreaga. He was Lil Kim\'s bodyguard. This happened in front of the radio station HOT 97. He was interviewed this year on why he did it.</p>
