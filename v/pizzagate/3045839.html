<p><strong>According to the article:</strong> </p>
<p>&quot;New allegations against R. Kelly have sparked a grand jury to convene in Cook County, Illinois, according to a new report.</p>
<p>Two sources told CNN of the development, but the Cook County State\'s Attorney has not confirmed a new investigation.</p>
<p>Lawyer Michael Avenatti tweeted Saturday that a recording that wasn\'t previously released &quot;allegedly shows further acts of sexual abuse of an underage girl by R Kelly.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;This would be a third and distinctive other tape,&quot; Avenatti told the Daily News. &quot;I\'m highly confident that there is a third tape and I\'m hopeful that we\'re going to be able to recover it and turn it over to law enforcement.&quot;</p>
<p>The attorney famous for representing porn star Stormy Daniels, who claims to have slept with President Trump just four months after his wife gave birth to their son, told the Daily News Thursday that he gave a tape featuring R. Kelly engaging in sex acts with a minor to the Cook County State\'s Attorney\'s office earlier this month.</p>
<p>&quot;I believe that as the result of the tape that we turned over to prosecutors that we can expect an indictment of R. Kelly ... shortly,&quot; Avenatti told The News.</p>
<p>On Monday, R. Kelly\'s attorney Steve Greenberg told CNN that he wasn\'t aware of a grand jury.</p>
<p>&quot;No one from law enforcement has contacted me or my client regarding any potential investigation,&quot; Greenberg said. &quot;Certainly they are aware that I am representing him so if there were any reason to speak to him I would suspect they would have reached out to me.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Grand jury proceedings are, by law, supposed to be secret, so to the extent people are commenting on what may or may not be going on today are possibly violating the law. Still, I can tell you that I am unaware of any proceedings,&quot; Greenberg added.</p>
<p>Kelly, 52, has denied the many accusations of sexual abuse against him over the years. In 2008, he was acquitted of all charges after being indicted on 13 counts of child pornography.</p>
<p>Last month, a new Lifetime docu-series that featured several women who were allegedly abused by the R&amp;B singer brought the scandal back into focus.&quot;&quot;</p>

            Lawyer is lying.  He works for a liar.  I am afraid this is some kind of joke and nothing will happen.  They had to come up with something after that horrid tape was released.  So possibly Avenatti is the fall guy and all this will only prove that he is innocent as he says.  NOT!!!  Remember that some have connected him to David G.  So either DG is willing to throw Kelly under the bus or this is just another dog and pony show.  I hope I am ever so wrong.
