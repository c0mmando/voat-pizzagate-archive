Through AIS, TW Vending fulfills all product needs for Turnkey sites in over 15 states and God knows how many 32Market sites throughout the country. This is as far as I got. This is not good.

This is relevant to pizzagate as there is evidence that implanted computer chips have been used for human trafficking and there are valid scientific studies it can be used for mind control. In 2011, California passed a law called &quot;California Transparency in Supply Chains Act and UK Modern Slavery Act Disclosure Statement.&quot; This law requires certain retailers to disclose their efforts to eradicate slavery and human trafficking from the supply chains. Microchip Technology is located in CA. Excerpts of their compliance response statement to this law reads, &quot;Microchip does not require suppliers to separately certify in writing their compliance to human trafficking laws. Microchip does not currently provide training specifically on the topic of human trafficking and slavery...&quot; This makes no damn sense whatsoever.
Here is an article from the SF Globe about a tagging device being found in a human trafficking victim by an ER doctor.

               Many experiences, diverse contacts and sources, and overlapping cases and investigations brought us a long way around and back to the simple Truth and "Root" of the entire system - Racine, Wisconsin.
              </p>
              <p>
               We can't do anything alone. We tried going to all levels of law enforcement, up to Loretta Lynch herself who obstructed investigations involving prominent officials, businesses, foundations, corporations and organizations. We tried going to the media including mainstream and alternative. We tried going to politicians including Paul Ryan, Ron Johnson, Paul Nehlen, Trump and Sanders campaigns, and others. They were all complicit and unresponsive. Paul Nehlen may have just been too busy with his campaign, too nervous to trust something he had not had time to research, or possibly hesitant to cross certain lines at the time. He was exposing corruption in more general terms similar to Trump, but neither Nehlen nor Trump have yet to expose the real Truth beyond political rhetoric. The only one who even responded and seemed to care was Jill Stein, but she was too focused on her own more narrow initiatives of election reform to really shine the light on Racine.

               The world needs to understand the real Truth, and yes angry_mob, they need to get angry. People should not be enslaved, trafficked, abused or harvested for others to profit. People should not be forced to bear the Mark of the Beast, or face death, torture or enslavement without it. People should not be struggling for life essentials while others abuse the system for billions in profit. We need the world to take notice and make a stand before it is too late.

               Racine is the "Root" of all Evil, and the key to Salvation.

                Jill Stein is also corrupt! (&amp; i voted for her - that shit pissed me off! i should've known better. it's just hard not to hold out hope. not for the presidency - i knew she wouldn't win of course, but that she had a backbone and was somewhat honest. she is not.) other than that we're on the same page. God help us.

                 Correct. All parties have been corrupted. The only hope for real global change is to reveal the real Truth and the "Root" in Racine, Wisconsin.

            People are also having chips implanted without their knowledge or consent. The following video is well over an hour but goes into the locations that they are finding unauthorized chips and various populations, such as military and politicians. They found them in places where people had surgery or dental work. They also found them in "little old ladies" (their verbiage) in their arms where they get their flu shot. I always wondered about why flu shots get pushed on us to the point of being free. Maybe this is why. If the following video is to be believed, one out of every three US citizens have been chipped.

            if the people doing the micro chipping really cared about all of the missing children then the narrative would be ' we can use the micro chip technology to find missing children '  .... no it hasnt even been mentioned in the media because the people behind it are the same bastards stealing them and trafficking them.

            I am SO glad I'm not the only who is terrified of this and related technology and how fast we as a species are zooming toward it, and willingly. Chips, transhumanism, all that-- we need to fight this trend. People NEED to wake up!

             This is not a trend, this is the progression to Global Enslavement and the Mark of the Beast. They want you to want it, but when you don't, it will be forced upon you without your consent. You will be rewarded for turning in others without it, until you are required to. Out time is limited. We must act fast before it is too late. The world needs to know about Racine.

            throw him some bones. Work out a secured method of communication so you two can work together. Neither of you have to do this alone. And you can put out a request for help when needed. My gut feeling is that you're legit but are understandably concerned about your safety. If you two can work out a plan or system, and then call in folks to focus on this or that piece of the whole, we can tackle it together.

             It was deleted. Do you know what it said or who said it? Others will concur that we try to respond to any questions or messages as time allows. We don't care who exposes the Truth, as long as the Truth is exposed. We all need to work together and unite to expose the real Truth before it is too late.

             Sounds like a plan.  I hope they take you up on it.  A small team of 2 or 3 with others jumping in and sending them info.  Great Idea.

             No. Because they can accuse any one of us, even if we're 100% innocent, to justify doing that to us. The murderers, rapists, and pedos should be jailed in general population prison and "sorted out" by their fellow prisoners. They shouldn't be out and about period, so no need for anyone to be microchipped.

               From what I hear, if a pedo is put into general population prison, their fellow prisoners will make the pedo WISH they'd gotten the death penalty. And, it's cheaper for us tax payers than having them on death row. So don't mistake my anti-death penalty for being soft. ;-)

            People really need to investigate what they THINK they know about the "MARK OF THE BEAST"  I am begging you to please  please  research research research!! We cant keep looking to what we were taught in church growing up .
           </p>
           <p>
            According to the last book in the Bible, 666 is the number, or name, of the wild beast with seven heads and ten horns that comes out of the sea. (Revelation 13:1, 17, 18) This beast is a symbol of the worldwide political system, which rules over “every tribe and people and tongue and nation.” (Revelation 13:7) The name 666 identifies the political system as a gross failure in God’s sight. How?
More than a label. Names given by God have meaning. For example, God gave the man Abram, which means “Father Is High (Exalted),” the name Abraham, which means “Father of a Crowd (Multitude),” when God promised that He would make Abraham “a father of many nations.” (Genesis 17:5, footnotes) Likewise, God named the beast 666 as a symbol of its defining attributes.
The number six implies imperfection. Often, numbers are used as symbols in the Bible. Seven typically represents completeness or perfection. Six, being one short of seven, can denote something incomplete or flawed in God’s eyes, and it can be associated with God’s enemies.—1 Chronicles 20:6; Daniel 3:1.
Three times for emphasis. The Bible sometimes stresses a matter by stating it three times. (Revelation 4:8; 8:13) So the name 666 powerfully emphasizes that God views human political systems as gross failures. They have been unable to bring lasting peace and security—things that only God’s Kingdom will achieve.
The mark of the beast
The Bible says that people receive “the mark of the wild beast” because they follow it “with admiration,” to the point of worshipping it. (Revelation 13:3, 4; 16:2) They do this by giving worshipful honor to their country, its symbols, or its military might. As The Encyclopedia of Religion states: “Nationalism has become a dominant form of religion in the modern world.”
 
*
How is the mark of the beast placed on someone’s right hand or forehead? (Revelation 13:16) Regarding his commands to the nation of Israel, God said: “Bind them as a reminder on your hand, and they should be like a headband on your forehead.” (Deuteronomy 11:18) This meant, not that the Israelites were to mark their literal hands and foreheads, but that God’s words would guide all their actions and thoughts. Likewise, rather than being something literal such as a 666 tattoo, the mark of the beast symbolically identifies those who let the political system rule their lives. Those with the mark of the beast place themselves in opposition to God.—Revelation 14:9, 10; 19:19-21.

             Only in some contexts. Take the number
             <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dda-0Q_XUhk">
              six million
             </a>
             (six and six zeroes). This is the number most famously associated with the holocaust, but it's not about imperfection. There's no business like shoah business, folks.
            </p>
            <p>
             Also take a look a Saturn, the sixth planet which happens to have a hexagon at it's south pole. Saturn is another name for Chronos, who was associated with cannibalism and infanticide, not imperfection.
            </p>
            <p>
             Then there's the honeybee who builds a hexagon shaped structure for the queen's eggs. Bees feature in the Catholic Exultset, which has more clues for those who understand the significance of names.

              Yea his message is too hard for some. Yet if people would take the time to understand the truth to his message well then I'll let the Bible answer this one ..Isaiah 48:18  If only you would pay attention to my commandments!
Then your peace would become just like a river
And your righteousness like the waves of the sea.
             </p>
             <p>
              The wild beast with seven heads introduced at Revelation 13:1 represents the worldwide political system.
             </p>
             <p>
              It has authority, power, and a throne, which point to its being a political entity.—Revelation 13:2.
It rules over “every tribe and people and tongue and nation,” so it is greater than a single national government.—Revelation 13:7.
It combines features of the four beasts described in the prophecy at Daniel 7:2-8, including the appearance of a leopard, the feet of a bear, a lion’s mouth, and ten horns. The beasts in Daniel’s prophecy are identified as specific kings, or political kingdoms, that rule in succession over empires. (Daniel 7:17, 23) Thus, the wild beast of Revelation chapter 13 represents a composite political organization.
It ascends “out of the sea,” that is, from the turbulent masses of mankind that are the source of human governments.—Revelation 13:1; Isaiah 17:12, 13.
The Bible says that the number, or name, of the beast—666—is “a man’s number.” (Revelation 13:17, 18) That expression indicates that the beast of Revelation chapter 13 is a human entity, not a spirit or demon entity.
Even though nations may agree on few things, they unite in their determination to maintain their authority rather than submit to the rule of God’s Kingdom. (Psalm 2:2) They will also join forces to battle God’s armies commanded by Jesus Christ at Armageddon, but this war will result in the nations being destroyed.—Revelation 16:14, 16; 19:19, 20.
             </p>
             <p>
              “Ten horns and seven heads”
Certain numbers are used symbolically in the Bible. For example, ten and seven represent completeness. The key to understanding the specific meaning of the “ten horns and seven heads” of the beast of Revelation chapter 13 is an “image of the wild beast” identified later in Revelation—a bright-red beast that has seven heads and ten horns. (Revelation 13:1, 14, 15; 17:3) The Bible says that the seven heads of this red beast mean “seven kings,” or governments.—Revelation 17:9, 10.
             </p>
             <p>
              Likewise, the seven heads of the beast of Revelation 13:1 represent seven governments: the primary political powers that have dominated through history and have taken the lead in oppressing God’s people—Egypt, Assyria, Babylon, Medo-Persia, Greece, Rome, and Anglo-America. If we conclude that the ten horns represent all sovereign states, small and large, then the diadem, or crown, on each horn shows that each nation rules concurrently with the primary political power of the time.

            Excellent post.  Saw this on the news today.  Isn't it interesting how they promote this?  Appealing to man's appetite for food, and ease.   And people are willing to give away their privacy for some shitty potato chips.  Dumb sheep, and evil foxes.

            This is extremely important and directly tied to the "Root" of the entire system in Racine and Wisconsin.
           </p>
           <p>
            The Real Agenda of Total Global Enslavement built up by the great lie of Sustainability that began in Racine, with the Mark of the Beast enforced through the model of Community Policing (also Racine, WI) and AI where no one can buy, sell or trade without it and people will be rewarded for turning in their family, friends and neighbors who do not bear the Mark of the Beast.
           </p>
           <p>
            They are beginning with corporate and prison populations until identity theft, human trafficking, and other related issues give cause for mandatory implants as we have seen with the progress of vaccinations (also tied to Racine, Wisconsin through Rotary International, the Gates Foundations, and others involved). Agenda 2030 is only part of the hidden bigger picture.
           </p>
           <p>
            This is connected to the Club of Rome, Pilgrims Society, Committee of 300, Freemasonry, Scientology, OTO, LDS, Jesuits, Black Nobility and Kabbalah, and the Council of 13 among other groups in the chain. It is also connected with the ancient discoveries in Wisconsin and Antarctica, including the expeditions of Admiral Robert Byrd and the Jet Propulsion Lab.
           </p>
           <p>
            The "Root" of all Evil and the real agenda is in Racine, Wisconsin. This is the Truth the world needs to know before it is too late.

              What are the odds? This is a shady deal and hiding the Truth about Racine County and Wisconsin.
             </p>
             <p>
              We do not trust Trump. He is in the same societies and circles as many others involved, and sings high praise for those we know are engaged in brazen and extreme criminal activity and corruption at the highest levels. We believe he is making deals behind the scenes to cover up the real Truth about corruption, collusion, and other crimes among his associates. Some may face consequences in various forms, and others like Reince Priebus might have to take a demotion, but the system will remain, and the plans will proceed. The only option is for the world to know the Real Truth about Racine and how it is a model for every community in the world and a "Root" to the entire system.
             </p>
             <p>
              Soon AI, bots, drones and robots will outnumber and control us along with Community Policing, and they will implement mandatory vaccinations and implants in a matter of time. Look who Trump is meeting with and making deals with. Look who else recently built a major factory on I-94 by Racine and Kenosha - Amazon. Google, Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Microsoft, Tesla, and their partners have a lot of control over what happens to humanity. They are so smart and have so much technology, but will they tell you the Truth about Racine, Wisconsin?
             </p>
             <p>
              This is also a way to cover up the Truth with positive news about jobs in Racine County. What they won't tell you is about the model programs being created in Racine for prison-based labor and second chance labor programs, public education takeover programs for private corporate partners, and the pattern or corrupt public-private partnerships to get criminals re-elected and corporations handouts and kickbacks. Surely the plan is to eventually implement microchips like another company recently announced.
             </p>
             <p>
              These are all steps toward the real Agenda, and the more reason why the world needs to know the Truth and "Root" of the system in Racine, Wisconsin.

               I know every president elected is through choice and not voting so have often wondered if this one slipped through or it is in fact a set up. For the amount of false narratives and bullying I am currently standing by my belief that Trump has slipped through and made it and will keep that positive stance until I see different. I don't doubt for a second Trump has befriended and double crossed the elite peados .. he is a smart man.
              </p>
              <p>
               There's a reason they picked Wisconsin to spend $30 BILLION .. in yet to figure out why. Maybe to deflect from the atrocities? I feel Trump is playing this cool as to not scare the "normies".

            This should get huge Upvoats. The plan is to chip everyone under Obamacare. It was written in the bill but not enforced. There are indications migrants have been chipped already. There is a thread on this. It is called the Efid chip.
           </p>
           <p>
            Edit: I noticed someone posted how this is first being implemented in prisons. The post above states this directly. As part of PREA or Prison and Jail standards. This is already happening in the military I bet.

             Oh thank you for the info.  I have been racking my brain trying to figure out why some of the Republicans still voted against taking down Obamacare.  McCain was it for me.  He voted no, voted against repealing it.  I was convinced there was something in it that THEY did not want to lose.  I thought something that could take away our children but now I know why.  That will one way they can take them.  They will be able to shop them.  They will know what they look like, be able to know their DNA and if someone wants them they will know exactly where they are, and that goes for us too.  THIS is our biggest danger, being chipped.  NO! NOT ON OUR WATCH.

            As far as determining exact purposes for a microchip, it seems nobody f'ing knows and/or nobody cares. It's a confusing MESS. So far, I have found out that every microchip contains a unique ID# that can be linked to an external database to determine if its purpose serves as a personal ID, for law enforcement purposes, your medical history, etc. It appears that multiple databases may exist.
The launch date of a commercial registry for human microchip implants was set for May 1, 2002. Back then, Applied Digital Solutions wholly owned subsidiary was VeriChip Corp., and they were to launch the Global Verichip Subscriber (GVS) Registry Service. The GVS Registry was hosted and maintained by Digital Angel Corp. operations in Owings, MD. Digital Angel divested itself in 2008. Now it's VeriTeQ, a provider of implantable medical device ID and radiation dose measurement technologies based in Delray Beach, FL.
This was as far as I got before a headache set in.

             has been saying.  WAKE UP PEOPLE.  Even people on here are not commenting because it is too scary to face.  We cannot fight it if we cannot face it.  UpVoat.  EDIT:  Glad to see those comments coming.  More than usual, but Keep Them Coming.  More Comments Needed to Get This Noticed!
