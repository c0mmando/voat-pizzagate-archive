<p>Well, it seems that th Silvestri family who run the resort at Casa de Campo have some quite interesting connections themselves : <a href="https://voat.co/v/thinkdrafts/3977183/25197352">https://voat.co/v/thinkdrafts/3977183/25197352</a></p>
<p>Dr Claudio Silvestri ran the resort for years and has recently relocated to Plano Texas. More about that later. But first a bit about his background: <a href="https://voat.co/v/thinkdrafts/3977183/25198133">https://voat.co/v/thinkdrafts/3977183/25198133</a></p>

<p>Dr. Silvestri has held management positions in prestigious hotels including the Grand Hotel in Rome, The Savoy in London, George V in Paris and the Plaza and Americana Hotels in New York. <strong>He was Hyatt International’s Director for Mexico.</strong>.</p>

<p>His son Philip designs websites and recently married an English woman Rebecca Hughes.  They recently moved to Plano as well to take over the running of Plano Profile magazine. Luckily Rebecca likes to blog about her new family, alot: <a href="https://voat.co/v/thinkdrafts/3977183/25197352">https://voat.co/v/thinkdrafts/3977183/25197352</a></p>

<p>On April 1, 2011, the Fort Worth Stockyards Stables were remodeled and reopened. <strong>They are located next door to the Hyatt hotel</strong> .... #2014 and #2016 are two EMD FL9 diesel locomotives that were originally owned by the New Haven Railroad.. and started by New York banker J.

<p>Philip and  Rebecca were able to take over the Plano magazine because Claudio Silvestri and his wife had ties to the city and knew the Plano mayor as well as Jean Newman, founder of Plano Profile and John Longstreet now CEO of  Quaker Steak &amp; Lube restaurants <a href="https://voat.co/v/thinkdrafts/3977183/25197499">https://voat.co/v/thinkdrafts/3977183/25197499</a></p>

            <p>
             My father is a pretty spectacular gentleman if I ever met one. I may be biased, but his unique charisma, charm and ability to relate on a personal level to every employee of
             <strong>
              Casa de Campo, as well as to Presidents, Kings and Queens
             </strong>
             has nothing short of amazed and inspired me. Though again, I may be biased but I have a feeling I am not alone with this sentiment.
            </p>
            <p>
             Knowing my father was ready to journey beyond Casa de Campo, the place he helped make such an iconic paradise, I’ve had some time to reflect before he embarks on his new ventures… After more than
             <strong>
              33 years
             </strong>
             working tirelessly to make the Casa de Campo resort a world class destination, the success of the rest speaks for itself. As a true gentleman would, he is the first to share, or give away credit for these accomplishments. Watching him work tirelessly and passionately for the ongoing improvement of Casa de Campo and its villa owners, I feel as if I have received a master class in what real vision, leadership and persistence can achieve.

             Dr. Silvestri directs The Silvestri Group’s real estate holdings, investments, and property management, as well as business advisory services for the tourism, hospitality, energy, wellness and publishing industries.
            </p>
            <p>
             Dr. Silvestri has held management positions in prestigious hotels including the
             <strong>
              Grand Hotel in Rome, The Savoy in London, George V in Paris and the Plaza and Americana Hotels in New York. He was Hyatt International’s Director for Mexico
             </strong>
             and managed the company’s commercial enterprise with Valores Industriales, S.A., through which he led the group’s growth, securing key acquisitions and management contracts that doubled the company’s portfolio of hotels in Mexico.
            </p>
            <p>
             In 1982, Dr. Silvestri was handpicked as President &amp; CEO for Gulf &amp; Western Hotels by
             <strong>
              Charles Bluhdorn, the legendary businessman who created a multi-billion dollar conglomerate that included Paramount Pictures, Madison Square Garden, and Simon &amp; Schuster.
             </strong>
             Mr. Bluhdorn tasked Dr. Silvestri with
             <strong>
              introducing luxury tourism to the Dominican Republic
             </strong>
             through the expansion and global positioning of Casa de Campo, the company’s 7,000 acre resort on the southeastern coast of the Dominican Republic. After the 1984 acquisition of Gulf &amp; Western’s holdings in the Dominican Republic by sugar tycoons, Alfonso and Jose Pepe Fanjul and partners, the company became the Central Romana Corporation. Dr. Silvestri continued with the company as President &amp; CEO of Premier Resorts &amp; Hotels, with the mission to grow the company’s tourism holdings.
            </p>
            <p>
             Always pushing his vision forward and facilitating team collaboration, Dr. Silvestri’s ability to manage complex negotiations with strategic stakeholders within the organization, external partners and government entities for over 30 years, has been instrumental in initiatives that have resulted in the creation of tourism business units such as an
             <strong>
              international airport, cruise port and cruise ship island concession.
             </strong>
             This powerful vertical alignment allowed for the increased utilization and positioning of other outstanding Central Romana Corporation’s assets, such as the concert amphitheatre, cultural centre, world-class sporting facilities and
             <strong>
              marina.
             </strong>
            </p>
            <p>
             After his tenure with the company, Dr. Silvestri continues to harness his passion and expertise through The Silvestri Group’s projects and endeavors, involving his established relationships throughout the world. His accomplished career has brought him
             <strong>
              in contact with international government officials, top multinational corporate executives, as well as dignitaries, celebrities and members of royal families.
             </strong>
             The success of his tireless work on these and other initiatives has been recognized countless times by governments, prestigious universities and international tourism organizations.
            </p>
            <p>
             <strong>
              Those are some extraordinarily big, immaculately kept, handcrafted Italian leather shoes to fill.
             </strong>
            </p>
            <p>
             So what’s next? Well it might be a shocker to hear that my father has no plans of retiring (I’m not even certain he understands the concept). Quite the contrary, he will be joining me at The Silvestri Group as Chairman and partner, working out of our new corporate headquarters in Plano, Texas.

             We really need to find out more about who are members of the extended Silvestri family. I'm finding a number of interesting characters but no idea if they are related. Example:

             <p>
              Just read an interesting article in The Palm Beach Post, on the front page : "Uber passenger says driver raped her" When I started reading this alarm bells started ringing. Seems the alleged rapist Gary Timothy Kitchings was 'House Parent" at foster homes.Kitchings recently worked at the KidSafe Sanctuary in West Palm Beach and Place of Hope also in W Palm.He worked in foster homes in Florida,North Carolina and Pennsylvania. The story said Kitchings and his wife had been house parents at various organizations for 17 years BEGINNING AT FATHER FLANAGAN'S BOYS TOWN in Omaha Nebraska !! There's a photo with him alongside our Franklin buddy Oliver North. He publishes blogs where he discussed his "career as a behavior-modification specialist" He wrote one story about an aging assassin confronting a demon.Strange stuff.

              This might not be related, but i know the Silvestri name only because there is a popular Hollywood Soundtrack/Score writer named Alan Silvestri, whose name i saw on many movies (decades ago.) Again a very long time ago I met another man with that name, very nice guy, and asked him if he was related. He was surprised i recognized the name and said yes, Alan is his brother (or cousin.. Cant rememeber.) Btw this was nowhere near California.

               “In Haiti the role of the Catholic Church is very important in terms of social activities and services to the population. What is missing in Haiti is the role of the state, because there are no basic services,” Silvestri told CNS by phone.

               “It is a very beautiful country, but the situation these days is very terrible. Every year there seems to be a crisis because of hurricanes or political crisis,” he said. “The president doesn’t want to resign and I think that the protests will continue.”

              (ORGAN) Transplant spokeswoman
              <strong>
               Pam Silvestri
              </strong>
              will practice what she preaches
             </h1>
             <blockquote>
              <p>
               Sports was fun.
               <strong>
                But in organ donation, Pam found a true passion
               </strong>
               . "It was perfect timing - the universe doing its thing," she said.
              </p>
              <p>
               She was soon hired to direct public relations for the Southwest Transplant Alliance and has been at it ever since.
              </p>
              <p>
               One of the first people she met on the job was Jennifer, who received a kidney donation in 1995 from a deceased donor. Jennifer contacted the organ bank in hopes of meeting the man's family.
              </p>
              <p>
               Pam helped arrange that. And the more the women talked, the more they bonded.
              </p>
              <p>
               "It's like we met and we just meshed," Jennifer said.
              </p>
              <p>
               "Every time I'm around her, I feel better about everything," Pam said.
              </p>
              <p>
               Pam eventually put Jennifer to work promoting organ donation among minorities.

              Gov. Rick Scott's 85-member entourage in the United Kingdom this week includes business leaders, tourism executives, and even a couple of lobbyists and mayors. The manifest, provided by Enterprise Florida, includes Ashton Hayward of Pensacola, along with outgoing Senate President Mike Haridopolos, who's on his third Scott trade mission.
             </p>
             <p>
              Lobbyists who accompanied Scott across the pond include Marc Dunbar (parimutuels), Robert Hawken of FCCI Insurance Group, Fred Karlinsky (insurance and health care) and John Sebreeof the Florida Association of Realtors. Tom Van Berkel, chairman of the Jacksonville Chamber of Commerce, is in England, as is Don Weidner, dean of the Florida State University College of Law. Mike and Nancy Crews of Custom Manufacturing and Engineering of Pinellas Park are trade mission exhibitors in London.
             </p>
             <p>
              Also on the trip: George Zoley, chairman and CEO of The GEO Group, Inc., the private prison operator based in Boca Raton. Thirteen employees of Embry Riddle Aeronautical University in Daytona Beach are in the UK as well.
             </p>
             <p>
              First Lady Ann Scott accompanied her husband. Others from the governor's office on the trip include press aide Jackie Schutz, Scott travel aide Brad Piepenbrink and Ann Scott's aide Sarah Hansford.
             </p>
             <p>
              Enterprise Florida spokesman Stuart Doyle said business community representatives decided on their own whether to go along, and are paying their own way. Doyle said a visit to Lloyd's of London is on the business of agenda, which is why some insurance representatives are attending, including state insurance commissioner Kevin McCarty.
             </p>
             <p>
              CORRECTION: An earlier post incorrectly reported that Jacksonville Mayor Alvin Brown traveled with the governor. Brown remained in Jacksonville.

              He died of a heart attack on his private jet while returning to the United States from his Casa de Campo resort in the Dominican Republic...His private funeral services were held at St. Mary's Church in Ridgefield, Connecticut. Among those who attended was friend and former Secretary of State
              <strong>
               Henry Kissinger.
              </strong>
              .. Bluhdorn's tumultuous relationship with appointed Paramount executive Robert Evans was documented in Evans's 1994 biographical book
              <em>
               The Kid Stays in the Picture
              </em>
              and in the 2002 film of the same title.

              The 1990 film
              <strong>
               The Godfather Part III was dedicated to Bluhdorn, "who inspired it."
              </strong>
              ..As Gulf+Western had purchased Paramount in 1966, Bluhdorn had plans to turn the island into a moviemaking mecca. For that purpose he constantly invited producers, directors, writers and movie stars so they could appreciate the natural beauty of the country.
             </p>
             <p>
              Former Paramount Studios set designer Roberto Copa designed the artist village of Altos de Chavón[10] in 1976 and it was built by Bluhdorn in the early 1980s. Bluhdorn's daughter, Dominique Bluhdorn, is the current president of the Altos de Chavón Cultural Center...Altos de Chavón also has a 5,000 seat open air Greek style amphitheatre, which was inaugurated in 1982 by Frank Sinatra[10] with the Concert for the Americas.
