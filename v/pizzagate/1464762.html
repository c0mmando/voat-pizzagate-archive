            Yes I agree that it will be difficult. Thanks for the contribution lol, just means people have to work harder on exposing the truth.

             We know for sure that Dennis Haster former House Speaker admitted to molesting minors. We know that Jeffery Epstein is a sex offender and we know that Bill Clinton has taken flights with him.
