            hey guys, i dropped out for a while, but tagged back in to research the elsa/spidey phenomenon a few weeks back.
           </p>
           <p>
            i want to drop something for you to help out here with direction.
           </p>
           <p>
            Awan was subscribed to six channels worth looking into, and none of them were, strictly speaking, elsa/spidey channels.
           </p>
           <p>
            FUNnel Vision
Denis
Annie LeBlanc
Bratayley
DisneyCarToys
SevenSuperGirls
           </p>
           <p>
            and then another channel which looks like it might be a sex toy channel - FunWareStore
           </p>
           <p>
            my research indicates (and no, i won't share the end result doxx with you yet) that four of these channels were based very close to where the awans lived...FUNnel Vision is in NC, Annie/Bratayley (same family) is in MD, and DisneyCarToys was in VA (moved, though, now in AZ)
           </p>
           <p>
            Denis looks almost entirely like a minecraft/roblox kinda thing, and may not be related - haven't looked into this one much.
           </p>
           <p>
            SevenSuperGirls is a huge network of really suspicious looking teengirl vlogs, like the annie leblanc channel, and i have stayed away from it almost entirely.  i might try to locate them soon, but early indications are TX or GA.  i think it's a compilation of several different operations.
           </p>
           <p>
            IN ANY CASE, the big deal is that Imran specifically sought these channels out, and was not subbed to a bunch of elsa/spidey channels or superhero channels in general - even though there are thousands of them.
           </p>
           <p>
            i can post an infographic of what i'm talking about but i'm not sure what's being used for image storage atm - i left right after the slimg site went down.

            I think I said in my last comment somewhere on voat that we should look at these houses before evidence is removed, at the people who have rented/stayed at the properties he and his family owns. These could potentially have been blackmailed.  Also these houses could have been 'set up' places for gov people to be videoed etc., when visiting  DC since it has been floated that the children are trafficked nearby.  (Robert Steele said that 'children are on the menu in restaurants in WDC if I remember in one of his interviews - possible not only as food? which is stomach churning to say the least)  Just a suggestion, we obviously don't know until whats on the comp hardrives are revealed. I am so sad right now.

            You earned my thumbs up the old fashioned way. Worked your ass off for more than a pat on the back, but the dignity of countless victims.
Shit, any who agreed with your post got some Karma too.
Funny, the spin doctors are between shifts and the woke folks have only posted.
Thank you.

            As was the case with HIllary's private email server, this story will run up against the public's total technical illiteracy.  For people familiar with IT operations these kinds of things raise a huge flashing red flag and banner - they KNOW that this is a big big problem.  Awan having the kind of access that would allow him to set up remote services on the network accessible to kids means he basically had unfettered access to everything.  Focus on what he probably did with that information, the shady money, any ties to spying, etc.  The technical matters will be used in court and be known by those who can understand (a few hundred k people in the USA), but the media will attempt to whitewash all of that.  Great find and post - keep digging and archive EVERYTHING with this guy's name on it.

             I may be wrong, but I think they are going to railroad him.  He is of no use to them now and they know he will tell all to save his neck.  Well, it was fun for him while it lasted.  That's what happens when you run with the devil.

              The fall-guy strategy is the usual go-to, but I feel like his proximity to DWS and her well, well-established proximity to HRC make that troublesome.  DWS wasn't supposed to be this well-known and I think they fucked up there in using her as a fall guy.  The events of the past few weeks really suggest that this whole machine is going down.

               Yes, he does have connections, but the fact that DWS nearly lost it speaks volumes.  There is some heavy stuff on that laptop.  Stuff like Huma has on hers, imo.  Did Awan send all the stuff to Debbie as insurance?  The Insurance File on Humas laptop was really disgusting stuff, or so we heard.  If this all comes out Netflix will go bankrupt.
