            As far as this story goes, I will have to look for other sources because when you have a mdeia blackout, and only perepheral outlets report something, it is difficult to verify something. The rule is usually three different independent sources.

            The calls for information in the comments are reasonable. If this is a murder, it is also true that anti-Clinton forces failed to create a network of support and information and the result is a lack of any credible information chain. Say it ain't so! I hope that if Eberwein was planning to testify against the Clintons that we will get a credible report as such. In the meantime, there is substantial evidence that the Clinton Foundation screwed Haiti. Real information. But even that isn't getting media coverage (and that's part of the reason Trump won). Hopefully the waters are not being muddied with an untrue story, but to many of us...we aren't sure yet.

             A good principle we should all try to follow: Never give Snopes an easy win. If Snopes has an easy win, we should be able to reasonably assume it was the result of misinformation/shilling.

              In the sense of giving Snopes a hard time, they declared he was depressed and working as a uber driver.
             </p>
             <p>
              Yet he was a business owner, a governmental official, and in good spirits to his friends. Was he about to open a new business in Miami? How could his mood turn sour? He argued about the Clinton foundation stealing Haitian money and Trump was in power, which should keep him positive. What motive did he have for being depressed and committing suicide?

               You would think people would be suspicious that snopes presumes to have the answer to every issue on this planet. The site was run by two flakes, an obese woman and a stripper obsessed geek. But present them anything from a story on the CIA to an article about a Tibetan leader and these two godlike creatures can give a true or false answer every time. It's hillarious that this never occurs to the average sheeple.

            Which guy in the video was him? I didn't watch the whole thing. What he said in the past and what he was here for are two different points. Do we have confirmation of why he was here and what he was going to testify about because so far I've only heard the echo chamber reflect back and forth with speculation?

            I was arguing with a friend on Facebook about this
            <em>
             suicide
            </em>
            .
           </p>
           <p>
            This friend presented me with the argument from
            <a href="http://www.snopes.com/klaus-eberwein/">
             snopes
            </a>
            of
            <em>
             the trial was an argument thrown out by a blogger
            </em>
            without any verified date. I've been looking for a verifiable source about the trial date, or rather any argument to undermine the integrity of the snopes argument.

             Snopes is compromised and has been for some time.

              I think I've read that
              <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/v/PizzaGate">
               v/PizzaGate
              </a>
              declared someone on Snopes was into Harry Potter fanfic porn, but declaring that outright...
             </p>
             <p>
              Is there any other evidence against Snopes? For instance is David Mikkelson associated with the DNC in anyway?
             </p>
             <p>
              I know Politifact was associated with a institute which had ties to the Clinton Campaign but they seemed to have scrubbed the ties to the institute from their site.
