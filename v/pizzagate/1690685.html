       There were five Baptist churches that funded and sent people to help.   First of all, we have the Central Valley Baptist Church.<br />
<a href="http://archive.is/bUAuc/image">http://archive.is/bUAuc/image</a>
Their logo struck me as odd, where the cross looks like a red X.   They mention programs for men and women, but no specifics.  (call us!).  However, they have lots of kids programs.  Including this Awana club - where you bring your children in and they do this club thing.   They ask that a parent or guardian remain in the building while your child participates.  Yes, you wait in the building, but not in the room.  What is Awana?   Well they sell a lot of kid stuff where apparently your child earns ranks and rewards.  It is made for clubs, but you wanna do Awana at home, here\'s what it looks like:  <a href="http://archive.is/NvAhv/image">http://archive.is/NvAhv/image</a>
Then there are these messages that the church posted about Silsby\'s mission:</p>
<pre><code>Rescue Orphans from Port au Prince, Haiti
JAN. 22 (Friday/Saturday): NLCR team fly to the DR
JAN. 23 (Sunday): Drive bus from Santo Domingo into Port au Prince, Haiti and gather 100 orphans from the streets and collapsed orphanages, then return to the DR
JAN. 24 (Monday): Bus arrives in Cabarete, DR at New Life Children Refuge

And then there is the Eastside Baptist Church:
<a href="http://www.esbctwinfalls.com/">http://www.esbctwinfalls.com/</a>
     Instead of a nice pic of a church, it has a hellish fire engulfed landscape on the title page.   No pics of a congregation.   Pictures of lots of empty little chairs.   LITTLE chairs.  Also, a picture where the shadows of trees look disturbing like dark spirits.  There are <strong>no crosses</strong> anywhere.</p>
<pre><code>Paul Thompson Pastor
Paul is also director of **New Horizon Home** in Port-au-Prince, Haiti.

</code></pre>

<p>The New Horizon Home is not to be confused with the New Horizons Home, also in Haiti.   There is very little info on the web about, except that I read that it has 20 girls in one place, and 43 girls in another.
<a href="http://archive.is/nO4tO/image">http://archive.is/nO4tO/image</a>
Paul Thompson\'s Blog has a page about the home.  Apparently you can stream video from the home, but it doesn\'t appear to streaming now.  Where have we seen the opportunity to stream video before?   Unfortunately, the blog about the Horizon Home is locked with a password for members only.  There is a news story about Paul Thompson on the Magic Valley website.  It talks a little about the Horizon Home.  It costs the East Side Church $2500 per month.   Like everything else with Pizzagate, it is bunch of odd things that are meaningless.  Except that Paul was there with Silsby to round up the kids.  Let\'s review:</p>
<ul>
<li>Pastor was arrested with Silsby</li>
<li>Paster Paul Thomas is Vice President of the <strong>Saudi Advocacy Network</strong>.  Huh?</li>
<li>Church Website had creepy artwork</li>
<li>No pics of congregation</li>
<li>No pics of Horizon Home</li>
<li>Video Streaming of Horizon Home</li>
<li>Horizon Home section of blog is Members Only with password</li>
<li>For some reason, the home has only girls?</li>

            Truth is, Silsby might not have been aware that she was a part of the CIA operation herself either, though I doubt it. She acted like a brainwashed person. I couldn't find anything particularly suspicious about the rest, and they were all freaked out with how unnatural Silsby's actions were after they were arrested also. It's kind of tough to have everyone complicit, because the testimonies wouldn't match if it's all lies.
           </p>
           <p>
            Paul Thompson could be complicit though. It would be an interesting lead because the Haitian Orphan Rescue Mission document was apparently created on Paul Thompson's computer, according to the PDF extracts. Where did you find the Saudi connection?
           </p>
           <p>
            If there were others that were guilty, it'd most likely be Charisa Coulter, and possibly Paul Thompson.

             Do you have any reason to believe that? Because I have many reasons to believe that's completely false and that she was well aware of what was going on.  I ask because of a research project involving these aspects, and Have not come across anything that gives silsby the benefit of the doubt.  If there is something of that nature, It's important that I don't leave it out of my project.
            </p>
            <p>
             I see you said  "Haitian Orphan Rescue Mission document was apparently created on Paul Thompson's computer, according to the PDF extracts. "
            </p>
            <p>
             Do you have a link to this claim? You insinuate that is a fact, assuming the PDF extract are accurate.(I Have no clue what a PDF extract is or how to know if they are accurate.)
            </p>
            <p>
             But assuming that is a fact, It still has no relevance as to whether or not she was WILLINGLY  trafficking humans. So again, not being confrontational, i just want to make sure I'M being accurate in my project. So if there's anything that corroborates that she was unknowing, that would be much appreciated.
