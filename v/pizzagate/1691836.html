<p><strong>THANKS GEORGE!</strong></p>
<h3><strong>106 Days and counting ...</strong></h3>
<p><strong>Radio Patriot</strong></p>
<p>Posted: 2/7/2017</p>
<p><strong>SENT OUT ON THIS DAY TO ALL ON MY MAIL LIST:</strong></p>
<p><em>Dear Friends,</em></p>
<p>*Andrea here with a somewhat long email to you. You might not even get to the end of it, depending on your perspective and view of things. But it is important enough that I feel compelled to let you in on what I and others now know*</p>
<p><em>I wrote this email several days ago, but decided to sleep on it before sending it to you because the information Im about to share is NOT what youll read about or hear on TV news. The corporations that own the media are also involved in this cover up, they will never tell you the truth of whats become known as the Deep State, a shadow government that is operating in plain sight, using unaccountable Black Budgets funded by you and me through Congressional appropriation, and through billions extorted from compromised individuals and corrupt activities that include unspeakable crimes.</em></p>
<p><em>Citizen investigator and self-described software developer George Webb Sweigert of Portland, OR, with the help of tips from FBI insiders and several other citizen researchers has uncovered what the CIA; the Clinton Foundation/Clinton Global Initiative; several US Senators (among them, members of the Senate Foreign Relations &amp; Armed Services Cmtes); US and NATO military generals (including David Petraeus); and the power elite are involved in.</em></p>
<p><em>Activities that include extortion, blackmail; money laundering; human trafficking; pedophilia and child sex trafficking; slave labor; kidnapping; illegal organ harvesting; medical experiments (including virus spraying and vaccine experimentation) on poverty-stricken populations; Middle East nation-toppling (Libya) for oil, pipelines &amp; minerals; illicit government pay for play contracts; bribery; perjury; obstruction of justice.</em></p>
<p><em>For example, it has been revealed that then-Sec. of State Hillary Clinton facilitated and profited from the trafficking of Libyan Stinger Missiles and Sarin Gas to the Muslim Brotherhood (ISIS), weapons which were obtained during the coup they perpetrated on Moammar Gaddafy, at which time they stole Gaddafys weapons, oil, gold, and $$$ billions. We came, we saw, he died.  Hillary Clinton</em></p>
<p><em>This story unwinds to show how Libyan arms trafficking led to the death of Amb. Christopher Stevens, and why the State Dept. and Obama White House ignored pleas for security and later, for rescue.</em></p>
<p><em>FBI agents and other intel officers in Field Offices across the country are taking a huge risk leaking information to Webb through surreptitious means in hopes that enough publicity and public pressure will be put on the Trump White House and the DoJ to bring the guilty participants to justice. Draining the swamp, as it were. These guys in white hats know whats going on, and know they must work around the corruption at the top of the agencies, especially the FBI, CIA and State Dept. if they have any hope of exposing these crimes.</em></p>
<p><em>Following these insider tips, Webb and many citizen sleuths are pulling on threads that lead to stomach-churning revelations, truly the underbelly of evil. Whats being uncovered and exposed is an extensive racket  a scandal of such proportion that if revealed could very well bring down our government. Many are involved, Republican and Democrat alike.</em></p>
<p><em>If youre wondering, 80% of Webbs investigative findings are fully sourced with linked citations to WikiLeaked documents and published articles and news reports, national and international. The other 20% is speculation based on logic and connecting dots. His citations are included with each video.</em></p>
<p><em>The ultimate incriminating proof of Webbs discoveries is said to be in the estimated trove of 650k non-governmental emails contained in 19 Gmail accounts used by Hillary, other State Dept personnel, and John Podesta, Sid Blumenthal, Huma Abedin and others who used them outside of the State.gov email system to hide their illicit activities from possible exposure via the Federal Records Act. Their illicit activities continue to this day.</em></p>
<p><em>Those emails were discovered by NYPD on a laptop used by Anthony Weiner and his wife Huma Abedin. The emails were viewed by an NYPD Chief who said what he saw made him sick.</em></p>
<p><em>Whats in the emails is staggering and as a father, it turned my stomach, the NYPD Chief said. There is not going to be any Houdini-like escape from what we found. We have copies of everything. We will ship them to Wikileaks or I will personally hold my own press conference if it comes to that.</em></p>
<p><em>The NYPD Chief said once Comey saw the alarming contents of the emails he was forced to reopen a criminal probe against Clinton.</em>

<em>People are going to prison, he said.</em></p>
<p><em>Unfortunately, it appears that since that public statement, the NYPD has been muzzled, and weve heard nothing more.</em></p>
<p><em>The 650k gmails are being withheld by FBI Director James Comey who is also believed to be involved via his dealings with the Clintons, their Foundation, the late Marc Rich, and Comeys stint at Lockheed. Also protecting the gmails from being released is FBI National Security deputy Andrew McCabe (who is believed to have taken a million dollar bribe via a campaign contribution from a Clinton ally to his wife, physician Jill McCabes State Senate race)</em>.</p>
<p><em>Are the top people at FBI in the protection racket??? And why is Preet Bhahara, the US Attorney for the Southern District of New York not pursuing this?</em></p>
<p><em>Are Pres. Trump, Sen. Jeff Sessions and the Trump National Security team aware of it all and biding their time? Will Trumps soon-to-be-confirmed Attorney General Jeff Sessions demand those Gmails be released for the American taxpaying citizens to see and for those who are guilty be brought to justice? Will Pres. Trump keep his promise to us to &quot;drain the swamp&quot;?</em></p>
<p><em>There are at least four, maybe five countries that through their own intelligence hacking sources know exactly what is in the 650k gmails being held back by the FBI. Among them: Russia and China. Likely Iran as well. (Israel is believed to have them too.)</em></p>

            Fantastic reference to Clinton Corruption and the ground-workings of Pizza-Gate.  There should be a sticky on this.
