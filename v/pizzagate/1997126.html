<h1>Trump-Russia investigators probe Jared Kushner-run digital operation</h1>

<p>Investigators at the House and Senate Intelligence committees and the Justice Department are examining whether the Trump campaign’s digital operation – overseen by Jared Kushner – helped guide Russia’s sophisticated voter targeting and** fake news attacks on Hillary Clinton in 2016.**...</p>
<p>Russia’s operation used computer commands knowns as “bots” to collect and dramatically heighten the reach of negative or fabricated news about Clinton, <strong><em>including a story in the final days of the campaign accusing her of running a pedophile ring at a Washington pizzeria.....</em></strong></p>
<p>There appears to have been significant cooperation between Russia’s online propaganda machine and individuals in the United States who were knowledgeable about where to target the disinformation,” he said, without naming any American suspects.......</p>
<p>It started even before Trump locked up the nomination. Throughout the Republican primary elections in early 2016, Russia sent armies of bots carrying pro-Trump messages and deployed human “trolls” to comment in his favor on Internet stories and in social media, former FBI special agent Clint Watts told Congress weeks ago.</p>

            OP is a known ShareBlue shill (therefore an enemy to our cause). Thus this article has no basis in truth.

            No one wants you here shill. Get the fuck out.

            Maybe Share Blue should become the target of another thread. That will be fun.

            No, Hillary was clearly at a business that displayed a known FBI pedo logo, and she was familiar with the whole damn block, so their is no way the Russians made it up.

             Known to who?  Did you know about this "pedo logo"  2 years ago, were you aware of this?  I certain wasn't.  And of course since this is so well known you to, you noticed all the differences between the image in the FBI document and the image in the restaurant.
            </p>
            <p>
             Are you aware of how poor the logic on this is? 
You do understand that 99.99% of the use of the word pizza has nothing whatsoever to do with this craziness, right? You're aware that placing an image within an Image is quite common in graphic design right?
            </p>
            <p>
             You can find tons of clip art photos that use similar designs

             You know your argument rests on 
Hillary went to a restaurant and got her picture taken with the owners.
Later that restaurant used her image in a brochure, brochure that used a common graphic design element, that was NOT an FBI pedo logo, but somewhat similar.
            </p>
            <p>
             How you justify accusing that restaurant of being connected to pedophilia?

              How long did she work in government? It would be really sad if she didn't know. The flyer was made in 2007.  So is it Comey's fault then?  Let me guess she had no Idea about the issues at the State department, or thousands of employees downloading cp at the Pentagon either right?

               She's never worked for the FBI, why would she know anything about internal FBI documents?  This whole argument is just grasping at straws after straw to try and fit a predetermined conclusion.

Afterall, the state of Indiana and one other state caught his guys 'performing a security breach test (cough cough)" into their voting machines and system.  Crooked Hillary and obummer were trying to steal the election because they knew fakenews polls were cooked

            This builds on a prior reports of suspected collaboration with Russian social media bots.  The fact that Jared Kushner is a person of interest in the investigation was news to me, however I just missed this.  This came out in May.
           </p>
           <p>
            The new information in this report is that in addition to his contacts with Russian officials, is that investigators are are also specifically asking about Kushner's role in digital operations, that targeted pro-Trump news stories to social media.
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             Trump son-in-law Kushner, now a senior adviser to the president and the only current White House aide known to be deemed a “person of interest” in the Justice Department investigation,
            </p>
           </blockquote>
           <p>
            This report builds on a earlier report that discussed how Russian bots blitzed social media with links to news sites like Infowars.
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             Operatives for Russia appear to have strategically timed the computer commands, known as “bots,” to blitz social media with links to the pro-Trump stories at times when the billionaire businessman was on the defensive in his race against Democrat Hillary Clinton, these sources said.

             The bots’ end products were largely millions of Twitter and Facebook posts carrying links to stories on conservative internet sites such as Breitbart News and InfoWars, as well as on the Kremlin-backed RT News and Sputnik News, the sources said. **Some of the stories were false or mixed fact and fiction, **said the sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity because the bot attacks are part of an FBI-led investigation into a multifaceted Russian operation to influence last year’s elections.

             As for the bots, they carried links not only to news stories but also to Democratic emails posted on WikiLeaks, especially those hacked from Podesta and made public in October, said Philip Howard, a professor at the Oxford University Internet Institute who has researched the bot attacks.

             Howard said that, as an example, bots had spread links to fictional stories that accused Clinton of involvement in running a child-sex ring in the basement of a Washington pizza parlor. The posts inspired a North Carolina man to drive to Washington and fire an assault weapon in the restaurant, according to police reports.

             There was an article recently that showed FCC public consultations related to net neutrality were mostly targetted by bots. The people who used to game online contests have found a home serving corporate interests it seems. You know what that article had? A lot of receipts in the form of API data and charts. I don't see an application of information science here, just yak yak about mythical Russian bots... This can all be double checked using publicly available APIs but the people running with the Russia Influence flag know people are polarized and lazy in the reading department.

              That's because that is not the focus of the article.  And this is building on prior reporting.

               Still looking for the data sciency articles. TBH I know the Trump camp is very attached to Russian interests as well as being close to a lot of shady Russian Americans (who are turning out to be comical as time moves on) but I am very interested in the purported efforts by "Russia" to influence the election. Because it doesn't seem like they (State sponsored THEY) specifically care for Trump compared to the strategic nightmare that a President Clinton &amp; Secretary Podesta situation would be for them in the short term.
