Edmonds gained public attention following her firing from her position as a language specialist at the FBI\'s Washington Field Office in March 2002. She alleged serious security breaches and cover-ups and that intelligence had been deliberately suppressed, endangering national security.</p>
<p>In 2009 she exposed Podesta\'s friend <a href="http://www.boilingfrogspost.com/2015/10/18/transcript-probable-cause-with-sibel-edmonds-the-mind-boggling-level-of-media-censorship-in-the-real-hastert-case/">Dennis Hastert as a pedophile</a>, and as a seller of favors to foreign governments and foreign entities.</p>
<p>In 2012 she published the autobiography <a href="http://www.classifiedwoman.com/">Classified Woman</a>. </p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XMoejT3lKs&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=3m48s">In this video</a>, released on November 11, Sibel says from 3:45:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>One of my FBI whistleblowers, and this was a decorated agent who never became a public whistleblower, but he went to court cases with the FBI internally because he DOJ IG, that is the Inspector General\'s office, etc.</p>
<p>One of the things this guy exposed, and I went to the media and I had this guy on the record with them but they never published, was:
he was working between 1993 and 1997 in this division in the FBI, where one of his tasks was running background check on federal judge candidates, and this is during the Clinton administration, because those federal judges have to be cleared by the FBI. They look at their background: are they pedophiles, are they rapist, you know, do they have some financial nefarious activities etc. </p>
<p>And he said, during these four years, when this decorated FBI agent, and this was 10 years, or 7, 8 years before he blew the whistle, he was running background checks on these federal judges, the way they were selecting the ones to appoint were the ones who had the highest number of skeletons. Meaning, the government, the Clinton administration (this is the head of the FBI, this is the OJ), they did not want to appoint any federal judges to the bench, and go through the confirmation process, if the judges, or the candidates, didn\'t have enough skeletons, meaning they have to be rapists, pedophiles, despicable characters, and that information is collected during the background check, and then they are used against these judges, so <strong>the judges rule per government\'s instruction</strong>.</p>
<p>Very simple, same thing, one of my main whistleblowing facts that I exposed, and this was between 2002 and 2006, and if people were to go and visit by state secrets gallery, there were going to see all these individuals, whether they were from the executive branch or congressional people, they were involved in the case I was exposing. And I talked about the fact that they were all blackmailed. Blackmailed by whom? They were blackmailed by the deep state.</p>
<p>So you sort of saying they formed a cold, I have to say what they do, *<strong>the deep state, they want to make sure that</strong> only blackmailable, maybe I made up a word here, <strong>only blackmailable candidates get to hold offices, whether executive offices, or they are in Congress, you know whether they are in courts, federal judges, if you\'re clean, if you\'re squeaky clean, and if you start running for a major seat position, the chances are you are not going to get there because you will be disqualified</strong>. They don\'t want you there. They can not put pressure on you by a blackmail. So that\'s the answer to the questions: no we\'re not gonna join this crowd and talk about there is a cold, it is not about cold, this is how this corrupt system has been operating.&quot;</p>

            I wish I had a Voat left for this. I have been following Sibel Edmonds for a long time now and what she exposed a decade ago is absolutely relevant to pizzagate (It is also aligns more with the type of investigation FBIanon was hinting at: less about Satanic Ritual Abuse and more about illegal weapons, drug trafficking, human trafficking, nuclear proliferation, bribery, and blackmail at the highest levels of government)
           </p>
           <p>
            She has intimate knowledge of congresswoman Jan Shakorsky being blackmailed by foreign governments and selling secrets to Israel, as well as her pedophile husband Robert Creamer, a powerful Dem lobbyist.
           </p>
           <p>
            She also lists powerful former Bush administration officials like Richard Perle, Douglas Feith, Eric Edelman, Marc Grossman etc. as being blackmailed by foreign governments and/or deep state operatives.
           </p>
           <p>
            I would not be surprised to see the tentacles of this Octopus overlap with the Clinton Foundation and all the connected players.
           </p>
           <p>
            You can see in the video she's damn tired of talking about it, especially since she risked everything to tell us for years.
