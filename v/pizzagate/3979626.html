<p>Hello Goats,</p>
<p>This is my second type up and attempt. Stopped/404ed by cloud. Either because my internet sucks, I shouldn\'t have visited LH0HQ, or this is a hot button. </p>
<p>Overheard someone talking about someone refusing to assist with helping an apartment owner in Berkley CA because he was involving his <strong>brother who was &quot;a sex trafficker&quot;</strong>. I asked for his name &quot;so I didn\'t rent one of his apartments&quot; but they didnt know much beyond that and what a friendofafriend said. </p>
<p>I searchVoat\'d and his name didn\'t appear, so I wanted him and the (families?) operation on everyones radar. It seems from my eavesdropping and research to be still in operation, and the San Fransisco Bay / Northern California Area, UC and Engeneering involvement are bound to link to our investigation. </p>
<p>The Brothers name is <strong>Lakireddy Bali Reddy</strong></p>
<p>Here is some of his story:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Lakireddy Bali Reddy (born May 20, 1937) is a landlord, convicted felon, and chairman of the Lakireddy Balireddy College of Engineering.[1][2] Reddy exploited the Indian caste system to bring young Indian women and girls to Berkeley, California.[3] From 1986 to 1999, he and his family members and associates forced them into servitude and sexual slavery.[4]</p>
<p>Reddy came to the United States in 1960 to study engineering at the University of California, Berkeley. By 1975, Reddy had opened a successful Indian cuisine restaurant in downtown Berkeley. He used its profits to purchase over 1,000 run-down apartments, making him, by the year 2000, the largest and wealthiest landlord in the city (other than the University of California), with a worth estimated at US$69 million[1]</p>
<p>In 2000, Reddy was indicted by the United States Attorney for the Northern District of California who charged him with sex trafficking, visa fraud, and tax code violations[1] following a lengthy investigation by the Immigration and Naturalization Service, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Internal Revenue Service, the Department of Labor, and the Berkeley Police Department.</p>
<p>On June 21, 2001, the United States Attorney for the Northern District of California announced that Reddy pled guilty to one count of conspiring to commit immigration fraud, two counts of <strong>transportation of minors for illegal sexual activity</strong>, and one count of subscribing to a false tax return for which he was fined US$2 million and sentenced to serve a prison term of 97 months (8 years 1 month) in the custody of the Federal Bureau of Prisons.[1]</p>
<p>Reddy\'s case ultimately served as the building block for California\'s anti-trafficking movement.[5] WIKI</p>

<blockquote>
<p>wealthy Indian-American Berkeley landlord Lakireddy Bali Reddy, 62 and other members of his criminal family. Reddy and his sons Prasad, 41, and Vijay Lakireddy, 30, along with his brother Jayaprakash Lakireddy, 46, and his sister-in-law Annapurna Lakireddy, 45, were charged with tax fraud and conspiring to falsify documents in order to smuggle numerous illegal Indian immigrants into Berkeley to work as indentured servants in Reddy\'s Pasand Madras Indian Cuisine Restaurant and other family-run businesses â€” and in the case of young girls, to serve as Reddy\'s personal sex slaves and unpaid laborers. WASS\'s members advocated (and still advocate) that Berkeley residents and visitors boycott the Pasand Restaurant.</p>
<p>The Death of Lakireddy Bali Reddy\'s Sex Slave</p>
<p>The Lakireddy Bali Reddy case unfolded when 17-year-old Chanti Prattipati and her 15-year-old sister Lalitha were found unconscious on November 24, 1999, by their 18-year-old roommate Laxmi Patati in a Berkeley, California apartment that was owned by and shared with Lakireddy Bali Reddy. Laxmi had stayed overnight with Reddy at his Berkeley hills home and returned to their shared apartment to find her unconscious roommates. Chanti &amp; Lalitha were poisoned by carbon monoxide from a blocked heating vent. Laxmi notified Reddy\'s family members at the Pasand Restaurant about the state of her two roommates, and they informed Reddy.</p>
<p>When Reddy arrived at the Bancroft Way apartment, he failed to call either the police or an ambulance. Instead, he had his company\'s van brought to the front of the apartment house where he, some of his employees and members of his family proceeded to remove the girls down a dark, enclosed stairwell that was adjacent to an open, clearly visible staircase. They carried Lalitha, who was unconscious, out of the building to Reddy\'s awaiting van, attempting to conceal her body by wrapping her in a carpet or cloth before depositing her in a the van. They also tried to drag Laxmi into the van despite the fact that she was screaming and resisting their attempts in great agitation.</p>
<p>Berkeley resident Marcia Poole happened to be driving down Bancroft Way when this  suspicious-looking scene unfolded before her. She watched as three or four men proceeded to the van carrying a large bundle with a discernable sag in the middle. She was horrified when she saw a leg dangle from the bundle before it was deposited in the van. She slowed her car to a crawl as she watched the men run back to a larger group of Indian men and women who had surrounded Laxmi. They attempted to push and pull her toward the van. Laxmi was crying and resisting their efforts with all her might.</p>
<p>Poole hastily jumped out of her car and attempted to thwart the efforts of Laxmi\'s would-be kidnappers by demanding that they stop trying to force her into Reddy\'s van. They ignored Poole\'s plea and a man, whom she later identified as Lakireddy Bali Reddy, told her, &quot;Mind your own business! Go away! This is a family affair.&quot; Poole refused to oblige him. Instead, she hailed two passing motorists and begged them to call 911 as she continued her efforts to prevent the attempted kidnapping from succeeding. Although the two male motorists would not get out of their cars to assist Poole with her solitary intervention of the kidnapping, one of them called the police. When sirens were heard approaching, the group that had been trying to force Laxmi into the van melted away into the surrounding area, leaving only Poole and the young girls at the scene.</p>
<p>After the paramedics, fire personnel and police arrived, the original group that had tried to abduct the girls started reappearing as if they had just happened upon the scene in passing. Poole gave the police a full account of what she had witnessed but, incredibly, the police decided that nothing was amiss. This hasty judgment was based on their naive reliance on Reddy as translator of Laxmi\'s answers to their questions. Reddy was therefore able to misrepresent her statements to the police. He also falsely identified Venkateswara Vemireddy to the police as Chanti and Lalitha\'s father. In fact, the girls -- who were using the phony last name was Vemireddy -- were unrelated to Venkateswara and his alleged wife, Padma, who was actually his sister. According to a newspaper account, Reddy had &quot;paid off an unknown amount of debt for Venkateswara in India and loaned him $6,500 to buy a pair of airline tickets to the United States for he and his sister&quot; in return for his cooperation in Reddy\'s immigration scam to get these two adolescent sex slaves to Berkeley (AP ,January 19, 2000).</p>
<p>Alta Bates Hospital nurse Connie Kulick reported in the Coroner Investigator\'s Report (March 3, 2000) that &quot;this 17 year old female [Chanti] died at Alta Bates Hospital, in Berkeley&quot; (p. 2). Lalitha &quot;was treated and released the next day&quot; (AP, Jan. 19, 2000). Despite the lack of time to properly investigate the case, Bobby Miller, a spokesperson for the Berkeley police, reported that Chanti\'s death &quot;had been ruled accidental,&quot; and that the case was closed (AP,Jan. 19, 2000). An autopsy found that Chanti was pregnant.</p>

<p>A year ago, millionaire Lakireddy Bali Reddy of Berkeley was sentenced to eight years in federal prison for smuggling teenage girls into the country for sex and cheap labor.

<p>In the Aug. 3, 2001, issue of the Daily Californian, Jay Lakireddy compared harboring illegal immigrants to going 65 in a 55 zone, and said he didn\'t know his brother was importing minors for sex. &quot;That\'s his personal business,&quot; he was quoted as saying. <strong>&quot;Why should I care?&quot;</strong></p>

            In the Aug. 3, 2001, issue of the Daily Californian, Jay Lakireddy compared harboring illegal immigrants to going 65 in a 55 zone, and said he didn't know his brother was importing minors for sex. "That's his personal business," he was quoted as saying.

            This is not Pizzagate-related and a perfect example of why "human trafficking" is a red herring.  You will never stop immigrant mafias from convincing desperately poor brown people to come here and surrender their passport, and some have burned down their "rescue center" in order to flee back to the traffickers.

              Pedophiles and traffickers get lower prison sentences than those with a little marijuana in their pockets here in the US. Shows where the priorities are / the problem is systemic in western governments and catholic church. That is where prosecution should be as well as the foot soldiers.

              Why don't you stick to ELITES since migration, labor exploitation, and prostitution are things you literally cannot prevent?

              You know 1/3 of them say they'd like to live here right? You gonna protect them all from their own choices, Superwoman?

              Clearly this is about your own vanity. "Catching child traffickers, save the children" blah blah.  You realize Indian-Americans control the entire small-hotel industry in America, right?

               I would consider the largest landlord in Berkley ( and "controller the entire small-hotel industry" ) an ELITE -
               <strong>
                and any CHILD - worth saving
