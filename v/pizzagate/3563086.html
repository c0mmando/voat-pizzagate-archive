Back in the late 1980\'s I had purchased a house under the Hollywood sign and was getting lots of work as an actor plus doing some small rewrites on feature films(mostly for dialogue which I was known for). So, back then, I was told about Newman and that he was a \'chicken diddler\' which at the time I had no idea what it meant. I was then filled in and told that he liked young boys, around 12 years old. Around the same time, a male model from Europe had rented a room off me in my house and he told me almost the same thing. On top of that he claimed Newman had come onto him. All this saddened me as Paul Newman was one of my favorite actors. Since all this, I have been told by at least 3 different sources(none of them related) that Robert Redford was reknowned for his penchant for call girls. I was even told by a woman I knew who used to work with Heidi Fleiss that on the day that Fliess\'s black book came out, Redford\'s name was the only one taken down and that he was listed but only for 1 day. Redford apparently would fly into Santa Monica airport and get in his grey porsche and pick up  a call girl and then go to his home that he owned or rented in the Malibu Colony. Interesting that I remember on the Howard Stern show that a woman called in and said her daughter had been a call girl and that Redford tried to silence the girl, hiring someone to break in her home and chased her around dressed as Ronald McDonald. Of course people listening to this on the radio thought that the woman was nuts but later I found out these are tactics used to make someone appear crazy, or mentally ill if they ever tell anyone. yeah, just a big laugh for everyone but the young call girl who felt her life was in jeopardy. </p>

<p>See, I worked with Redford and admired him and was disappointed to find out first hand that he was a bit of a phony.

            The reality is that they're all sick sadistic perverts.  Nobody will get to the level that they get in entertainment or politics, unless they are fellow "club members" as sick sadistic perverts.  They will protect each other and make sure that the club is never really threatened.

            I have indexed through my memory of hollyweird types, and remember hints from the past, whispers, etc.
           </p>
           <p>
            Nothing, no one (particularly from hollyweird or gov) with pedo/deviant connections will shock me. I opened my mind long ago.
           </p>
           <p>
            Remember Montgomery Cliff, Rock Hudson, J Edgar Hoover, Elton John... when it became fashionable to admit deviance (they called it 'gay', which, after (((their))) priming us with film, music, "Etv" culture propaganda, was A-OK). Reminds me of Spacey's declaration "I want to live my life as a gay man." Labeling sexual deviate behavior as gay conceals their really deviate behavior. They think.

             Yeah, as a sidenote, I had been, when I was pretty young, a male model in London England and  met some guy, his last name is Foreman and he bragged he was best friends with Newman. He had invited me, after we had dinner(for some movie he said that he thought he might have a role for me in it) up to his hotel room where after some chit chat, he suddenly pulled off his belt and was moving towards me, slapping the belt in his hands, very menacing at the time. I relaxed then suddenly shoved him against a wall and made a dash for the door. I got out of there and never heard from that creep again. John  Foreman, THAT was his name. Sure enough, he produced a few Newman movies, but what a slimebag. Never should have gone to his room but I was like 21 years old at the time and thought he was some macho big shot producer from Hollywood. I wonder how many other young men the guy raped. Since then, I met people that knew him and his children. My recounting of that story left them all slack jawed, guess they had no idea and thought he was a good family man. far from it

               I lived there almost 20 years and did over 30 films I know a lot, first hand but was kept out of the loop regarding child abuse and pedophilia because they probably did a profile on me and knew it was something I wouldn't tolerate or keep my mouth shut about. I wish more people would read this as I get a bit antsy and am anxious to take it down when I feel enough have seen it. It is no joke, I have lived through death threats extreme harassment over me trying to find out who beat up my ex and who threatened my 4 year old son(to be hurt if he talked to me). My ex was MKULTRA and the way and behind my back, back when I made very good money, she was working as a call girl and even a prostitute at a trailer next to a gas station 2 miles from where I owned a farm in Canada. I had left L.A. hoping to make a better environment for my children...what a joke in retrospect
