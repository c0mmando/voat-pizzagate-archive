           This is barbaric. They won't give the baby to the parents to bring to the United States for an experimental surgery. The "human rights" court ruled the hospital is allowed take him off life support and he "die with dignity" This is sick it is NOT the hospitals right to do this to a human being give him a fighting chance.

            Oh for fuck sake. The kid is severely brain damaged. This treatment in the U.S won't reverse that. The parents are fighting for a life which does not exist anymore. The kid is gone. All that remains is a body, incapable of living outside of a bunch of machines.

            I feel for the anguish of the Parents, but they are grieving for the impending loss of a child that "died" long ago.
