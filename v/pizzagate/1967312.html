            Oh for fuck sake. The kid is severely brain damaged. This treatment in the U.S won't reverse that. The parents are fighting for a life which does not exist anymore. The kid is gone. All that remains is a body, incapable of living outside of a bunch of machines.

            I feel for the anguish of the Parents, but they are grieving for the impending loss of a child that "died" long ago.
