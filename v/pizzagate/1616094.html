            LOL I won't deny having lovely thoughts like this myself, but I realize it would be just a drop in the bucket.  Somehow, and I haven't figured it out yet, our world, all of humanity, is allowing it to happen, is almost supporting it.  So if one guy gets knocked off, they will just hire another guy, or set up another Brownstone, or anoint a new leader of the coven.  What is the core of this thing?  What allows it?  'They' do literally whatever they want with all the children anywhere they like.  They are like an opportunistic disease that has grown on our unhealthy society.  So yes, we can and should incarcerate them, but they will come back until we become healthy.  Or something.

            Everyone is missing that Epstein is involved in these operations with the US. The front company Dyncorp is a mask for the CIA. Calling him a criminal or pedophile does nothing until you realize this fact. That involves all Administrations since at least George H. W. Bush including Obama. If you want to be educated and shocked a video was posted on this sub titled "best video ever watched" or something to that effect.
 It will take you into the buildup of Hitler's Party. Who financed it. Our own politicians involvement and the Vatican 
How everyone got rich off the concentration camps. The founding of the CIA with the SS &amp; secret societies, Their involvement in JFK, names all parties involved including generations of Bushes, through Clinton's and 9-11 into current day. 
You will be shocked but may clear up any misperceptions you had that everyone since G.H. W. Bush have been nothing more than puppet agents. 
They are all called the American Nazi's. Watch it.
           </p>
           <p>
            For those who want to dismiss it as having nothing to do with satanic abuse&amp; sacrifice. Please look deeper

             Sorry, but this financing story of Hitler has been debunked already. Also Hitler was fighting the Globalists. Freemasonry was forbidden (Roosevelt, Churchill were high grade freemasons). There are interesting speeches from Hitler on YoutTube, how he educated the Germans about the "international hyenas" and their goals for NWO.
            </p>
            <p>
             What is true indeed, that Wall St. financed the Bolsheviks. For example Trotzki had already been arrested in Canada. A tremendous technology transfer from US companies took place.
I find it similar, how China was built up since the 1990s...
            </p>
            <p>
             What's also is very interesting:
Not only jewish Hollywood directors like Hitchcock and Wilders made the Nazi concentration camp movies, which all the world believes were documentaries, where, for example, they presented people with typhus as people that were starved to death!
But especially when someone looks at the creators of the Buchenwald movie (with the shrunken heads, lampshades,...) something very interesting appears: the same top names involved in this movie later appear in the WARREN COMISSION, which "investigated" the assassination of JFK - the story of the magic bullet comes to mind...

             It seems more and more like Hitler was a patsy. Not that he wasn't evil, but more like an insider (see Osama or Khalid Sheik Mohommad as other examples) who was utilizing the same tactics currently used in Haiti. It was just first attempted within Germany and Europe was to follow. Remember, the Americans were late to the war. Only felt palatable to the citizens after Pearl Harbor. Similar to 9/11 the American citizens needed a visceral reason to enter the conflict with no questions asked.

             Remember how easy it was for Bernie Madoff to control the SEC by marrying his daughter off to the guy who was supposed to investigate him? Citizen investigators like us had him figured out and busted in the 1990s!!! And all good citizens could do was keep sending the proof to the SEC, who let him get away with it until December 2008 because they were on the take. Same situation here until the DoJ gets cleansed.

            Hey Rebel, it might be worthwhile to look at the available flight logs and check the countries flown to/from...I don't know if anybody has done that yet? From what I have seen people were mostly focused on who was on the plane.  The word "abroad" caught my interest in the quote you posted.  Be interesting to see how many flights to Haiti and Dominican Republic.

              This has already been proven. We are chasing each other if people have not grasped yet what a "Brownstone" is? That Epstein runs them with CIA..Dyncorp is the front company.
