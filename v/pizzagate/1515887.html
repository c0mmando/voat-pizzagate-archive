<p>&quot;Doing the same with “exiles” from English into Koine-Greek, the Koine-Greek listener would link it to a similar Greek word that connoted deep inhalation of air or “heavy breathing.”</p>
<p>This is tied into the Greek word “epithumia” which in English is normally translated as “lust” but the literal meaning in Koine-Greek meant literally “heavy breathing” and was connoted with desire. </p>
<p>Now this terminology is then linked to the word “Porneoh” from which we get the word Pornography. Porneoh=lust fulfillment by sexual relations in exchange for money… which again was the main claim to fame for Ishtar… <strong>holy sexual prostitution</strong>.&quot;</p>
<p>When I visited the website of the band Heavy Breathing (www.heavybreathing.net <strong>Warning</strong> there is some weird creepy stuff on there, nothing unsafe for the computer though I think.)</p>
<p>The first song after you click to enter the site is called \'In The Mood\' and has this animated man bending over showing his bits and peeing or doing something \'else\' on the ground.</p>
<p>The Swedish artist and singer Loreen has some very Illuminati symbol-filled videos and I found that in one of her songs \'Do We Even Matter\' the first lyrics are Heavy Breathing:</p>
<p>&quot;Heavy breathing what\'s this feeling
Never used to act this way around you
I\'m afraid of digging deeper
\'Cause if I fall I might lose it all&quot;</p>
<p>She can be seen making the pose of Baphomet at one of her shows \'Melodifestivalen\' in the video below which is safe to watch:</p>

<p>We know these people are Luciferian, I\'ve found that we can\'t separate the link between children, the occult, Lucifer and the Illuminati, it\'s all connected. </p>
<p>The following may or may not be related but I found a band called Black Breath that has a song called Heavy Breathing which played in Washington D.C. One of their group photos depicts the band members standing over a naked person on a table who appears to be ready for sacrifice. They are definitely Luciferian. The link below is safe:</p>

            these cucks are going to be ass raped by their own foreskins very soon, as placed on sharp sticks... though it is interesting watching them ATTEMPT to create a "culture" out of pure ELITIST VAMPIRISM... much like watching a train wreck falling over a picnic full of politicians and central bankers might be mildly entertaining
