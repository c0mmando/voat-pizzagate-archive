            Guys, I am seeing many trolls. Is that your experience? I don't mind, no one can troll me but just expressing my concerns. I know that the elite are absultely terrified. Their game is being outed, all the children's foundations, NCMEC, orphanages, big names - they are panicing and I am sure they are sending trolls and agents on many sites.

            While not all homosexuals are pedophiles, every pedophile is a homosexual by default. Men are designed to hone in on a potentially fertile woman, hence the proverbial Wolf whistle drawing hour glass shape in the air - that is what men go crazy over, female curves, large breasts, wide hips, pouty lips, long hair, shapely legs - this was in built as a short cut to identify a healthy fertile female. Men are highly visual. Characteristicsc that seduce men are absent in children and of course other men. This was a clever safe guard put there by nature to keep children safe from randy men in need of a sexual encounter. Since men are turned on visually by charachteristics of a fertile women children were always safe in the presense of adult males. But if a man exhibits homosexual tendencies the game changes! 
Hence all pedophiles are homosexual by a definition while not all homosexuals are pedophiles. In case of women pedophilia exists in very low numbers. Feel free to refute me giving examples. No trolling please. Children are at stake. We are trying to get to the bottom of this whole LGBT agenda. 
PS I am not a homophobe by a longshot. In fact the image of two men getting it on has the same appeal as two aliens having sex - morbid fascination of a National Geographic kind. In other words I find the whole thing too bizarre to even be disgusted by it. It's comical, farce! Hence pedophilia for a red blooded man is an alien territory. The elites are aware of the chasm that exists between the realit as in public perception and what actually exists!

            Fyi we generally require the symbols to overlap as that's the consistent imagery we see. Ima go ahead and say you're un intentionally  correct and it's fucked up that there's a whole group and logo for Mardi gras a stupid French holiday alien to Australian culture, in one city sydmey, and for homos THAT'S THREE THINGS

            I don't think the 2 things are mutually exclusive. I do believe in a genetic basis homosexuality. I also believe that things are co-opted by the dark side.

            I agree with you, in this politically correct world, people hate the truth and yes homosexuality is a sexual perversion, our sexual organs were meant for procreation.  Penis for vagina and vagina for penis, you put them both together and you'll make a baby.
           </p>
           <p>
            Sexual immorality is gaining acceptance, because the world is becoming more wicked, it's started off with gays, then transgender came in, next is pedophilia, and then beastiality, it'll be just like the days of Noah

             Homosexuality as a sin is a consequence of ones actions as opposed to a mere state of being! It is what they do, not who they are. A homosexual man has a hypothalmus of a woman, it is a pathology. But since his sexual needs in his state cannot be realized in a conventional heterosexual framework, his only option should be celibacy. Now let me explain in case I sound too harsh. Take an example of a real life disorder - say a man who is a narural born arsinist. Medical doctors and psychoanalists have done studies of arsinists and concluded that it is in fact a product of a psycho pathology. He has this ovewhelming impuls to set objects on fire. Now imagine if a state recognizes his needs and tells him that his rights will be protected, and once a week government will allocate a derelict building for him to burn down! Insanity you say! And you are correct. But is sodomy any less insane? So in case of our two dear friends, one being a homosexual man and other - an arsinist, the solution is to Sublimate their desires into something constructive. A sacrifice has to be made for the good of the nation. Make America Moral Again
