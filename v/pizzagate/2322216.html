            Great Research! - Roger Took, it would be interesting to find out who his 'high society friends' are (or should I say fiends who wrote character reference letters to the judge requesting lenience in sentencing) and what they are up to today!!  - Thank God he killed himself, it probably saved other children theirs!  Just sad his grand-daughters have to live with the experiences their sick grandad did to them.        -             Only reason you would buy Catherine Yass urinal 'art' imo is because they bring back memories of something, maybe like all their other 'white tiled' sadistic painting with little children with red backsides, and red shoes! -  Good research, you could probably add British 'Artist' Maria Marshall who #PIZZAGATE shared and I posted on voat 9 months ago.  Podesta is connected there too and #PIZZAGATE was even 'attacked' on a BBC interview with Maria Marshall for connecting her, Podesta &amp; pizzagate - it certainly looks like she includes spiritcooking in her art and her 2 young sons -  ART? Maria Marshall uses her 2 young sons as her 'artwork' -

              According to Charlotte Metcalf, Took's charm, social status, academic reputation and credentials served to "cushion him from condemnation".
             </p>
             <p>
              His case received little publicity and he enjoyed support from former colleagues.
             </p>
             <p>
              During sentencing Judge Blacksell, who stated that he had no doubt that Took suffered from an illness, took into consideration 23 letters of support and three character witnesses who spoke at the hearing on behalf of five people. He was described as a "gentle, kind, caring man who has enriched the lives of many over many years".
             </p>
             <p>
              Those who spoke were his older half-brother, John Michael Took; the Reverend Adrian Gabb-Jones; and Matteos Los, a schoolfriend from a Greek shipping family.

             This character reference letter crap has to stop!
            </p>
            <p>
             Basically, it means that when you're upper class, you get some of your buddies writing a letter that states what a valuable member of society you are.
            </p>
            <p>
             Someone who rapes children and who enjoys watching documents (films or photographs) that show children raped by animals doesn't have a good character, period.

            <p>
             And the sentence he got was ridiculous.

              This comment reminded me of the SRA Ricky Dearman Case (Hampstead Cover-up) When so many parents wrote letters of commendation of the teachers and school -  the children had already mentioned that almost all the teachers and parents were involved!!!!!!!!   It is looking so true, the same m.o. being use!  Not that I ever doubted the children, there is no way they could describe, act and remember that amount of information, no matter how practised or scripted AS the doubters would like us to believe.

               This is the Charlotte Metcalf article

             <blockquote>
              <p>
               Took lived in a beautiful, spacious home in Chelsea, surrounded by paintings and books, and was able to blind those around him with the sheer weight of his glamour and assured social status. Many paedophiles can. It is as if a man of intelligence and achievement cannot take the intellectual leap into such darkness. But he clearly can — and has.
              </p>
             </blockquote>
             <p>
              I'm sure that anyone at that time who suggested that Took was a vicious pedophile was mocked as a "conspiracy theorist."  The common misconception was that the case was "debunked."  (I don't know if this is true or not.  I'm speculating here to make a point.)  This is a lesson and, I feel, important background for pizzagate.  So-called respectable members of society's elite do in fact rape and torture children.

              Very good.  I had seen some of these 'artists' before but not connected them to anything. There sure is some absolute despicable 'art work' out there - their minds are what I imagine hell to be like!

            That's an informative article but the pictures are sure hard to look at. Anyone who would purchase and hang such horrors in their house have to be twisted and sick.

             This is such an important point, art really reflects upon a persons tastes and interests. My walls are full of motivational poster-type flags, cats, koi ponds, homemade crafts, drawing my son has brought home from school, photos of family and friends, holiday snaps and souvenirs from different countries and places I've visited... stuff I consider to be pretty damn normal really... What the fuck are these people into that their walls depict dead bodies and naked children? It should raise a question for any reasonable person.

            Spot-on research, people need to start seeing the British influence of Pedo cults and their role in intelligence circles. Tbh I think Alefantis is a British spy but such a description doesn't do justice.
