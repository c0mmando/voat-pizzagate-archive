<p>So I posted <a href="https://www.thenewamerican.com/usnews/crime/item/25688-in-child-pornography-case-government-admits-cia-leaks-are-real">this article</a> in The New American earlier, and reading it got me thinking about this. Read this paragraph:</p>
<p><em>&quot;Since the hackers would then have remote access control over any such device, all files and folders would be available to the hacker. Worse yet, having control of the device would also allow the hacker to either remove or add files and folders. If the hacker wanted to bring an adversary down, it would be a simple matter to create a hidden folder containing illegal files — including child pornography — on the victim’s device to be “discovered” at a later date by investigators serving a warrant. Such a sting operation would look — for all the world — like a legitimate law-enforcement activity. Even if it did not end in a prosecution and prison, the victim could be branded for life. After all, this is almost exactly what happened to former CBS News correspondent Sharyl Attkisson. In her case, the hidden files that were secretly placed on her computer were classified government documents for which Atkisson could have been charged under the Espionage Act for possessing.&quot;</em></p>
<p>So there you have it - using the Vault 7 tools, it is now possible to undetectably load files on to pretty much anyone\'s PC.
So now, a lawyer can pretty much claim that &quot;My client in no way has any knowledge how this snuff film of a four year old child got on to his computer. Someone must have remotely planted it there. I mean, look at the Wikileaks revelations about the tools that are now available to do just that kind of thing!&quot;</p>
<p>The FBI already had to back off from a previous case because they didn\'t want to reveal that they had this kind of technology. From the same article:</p>
<p>*&quot;If the desire is to arrest and prosecute those who frequent child pornography sites, one might reasonably expect the agency to press on — even in the face of legal challenges — to get those convictions, right? Well, that all depends.</p>
<p>\'When the lawyer representing Jay Michaud, a school administrator from Vancouver, Washington, challenged the government’s case against his client, demanding to see the source code for the hack the FBI alleges led agents to his client, the government dropped the case. According to a report by ZDNet from March 6:</p>
<p>\'The FBI used a &quot;network investigative technique&quot; — a hacking tool that in any other hands than the feds would be considered malware — to deanonymize the users of the Tor browser, a widely used app for easy access to the dark web, during its 2015 investigation into the website.</p>
<p>\'Little is known about the hacking tool, but it was known to be able to gather real-world information on Playpen visitors, such as IP addresses — details of which should have been protected by Tor.</p>
<p>\'But the government refused to reveal the full source code of the exploit in court, and so the judge tossed out the evidence, rendering a significant set-back to the government\'s case.&quot;
*</p>
<p>But that was back in 2015, before Pizzagate broke. But NOW, with the prospect of upper level people getting indicted, it would make sense that they would leak that they have the tools to undetectably load files on to anyone\'s computer. Then the pedo\'s lawyers can claim that they are victims of a political revenge plot or a competitor wanted to bring them down, or whatever. </p>
<p>And recall we have <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-4109662/Top-U-S-spy-chief-says-s-possible-Russia-plant-child-porn-American-computers.html">already had</a> Clapper floating the idea that &quot;Russians&quot; might have planted child pornography on American\'s computers. But now it is KNOWN that this kind of technology actually exists, even if it was developed by Americans for Americans. (Oh the IRONY!!!)</p>
<p>Oh yes, the FBI or some other alphabet org would continue to feign like they don\'t want to admit that they have these tools. But now that it is public knowledge, they would have to &quot;acquiesce&quot; and &quot;begrudgingly admit&quot; that they indeed have this capability, and it is &quot;feasible&quot; that the pedo could indeed have been compromised by someone else. I guess I would look for this kind of scenario to play out.</p>',

            I think Vault 7 is related to Cicada 3301 and Tengri 137. If you don't already know about this, watch the YouTube channels, The Outer Dark or Defango. They've been doing some major puzzle solving and investigative work. Here's one link to a video..

            Yup, I had the same thought.  Vault 7's revelations will give the bad guys "plausible deniability," which they can argue to a judge or jury in hopes of eliciting "reasonable doubt."  Notwithstanding the aforementioned, I still think the Wikileaks Vault 7 leak was a good one.  I just wish they'd release more, and that everyone with info would grow a pair and leak it all.

             I wasn't convinced of this until I stumbled across some initiative called #diem25 on Twitter. Apparently, this is some international think-tank that tries to redefine/save the EU-project. I read their website, and it shows Julian Assange (who is now seen as the "hero" of the rising anti-globalist agenda) as their most prominent staff member. But reading the site, their statements, their proposed methods, and mainly their view that the flood of migrants that currently destabilize Europe should continue unhindered, I couldn't help but conclude this DiEM25-project has Soros' fingerprints all over it. It has the same kind of people, the same kind of stuffy liberal morality, promotes the same kind of Alinsky-like methods of raising awareness with localized pressure groups and events etc. etc. And, if you read carefully, you'll find it's just the same old globalist agenda, polished to look like something new.
            </p>
            <p>
             Which would mean Julian Assange is indeed compromised, or dead, or both, or whatever, but at the very least "used" as a masthead figure for some controlled opposition campaign.
            </p>
            <p>
             This would also mean that Wikileaks, and their strangely bombastic Vault7-leaks, are also compromised. Isn't it weird that the Vault7 leaks are all about Apple, Microsoft and Samsung: the most important competitors of Google? Why is Google, the biggest and most successful spying machine on the planet, left untouched? And, why would the CIA need to develop all these complicated technical hacks, when Google is able to provide them with everything they wish to know?
            </p>
            <p>
             Seen from that angle, Vault7 is just a carefully crafted exposé of CIA technology that was outdated anyway, to discredit Google's competition, and to, indeed, create a legal basis for letting future high-ranking pedo's off the hook.

               Where have I mentioned Android? If you're referring to Samsung (that uses the Android OS on their phones and tablets), you might have missed that Google recently became a serious competitor when it comes to the devices itself... Google introduced their Pixel phone, and the sales for this Galaxy/iPhone-rival are lagging behind expectations.

               Very classy to call people 'idiot' right off the bat, by the way.

            Yes - we can only hope. That is the kind of thing that would be needed. Just CP or photos/videos of persons unrelated to the defendant could use the "it was planted" excuse.

            Yes but they wil not be able fix the people they find on pictures/video's who are doing horrible stuff.. I agree they will try to put it on the Russians the way you say, Clapper already made such a suggestion. But i think there will be so much other evidence.. Just look at the George Webb video's, its really big!

             Thanks. To your first point - yes - actual photos/videos of actual people caught in the act is the standard of evidence that would have to be presented. (Probably supporting testimony would be required as well to nail it - especially for photos.) Anything short of this could be "explained" by saying it was planted (my example of the snuff film was deliberate).

              Oh yes! They will try this.. Clapper did say this with a purpose. But there is soo much more where the Clintons/Soros/Obama and many more are involved in. That Always leaves traces..

            The only problem? It would bring too much unnecessary attention to the CIA (they don't want that) and by the same token discredit the Russia planted CP on my computer narrative. Using that as an excuse puts them in a bad situation.

             Thanks. Yes, I thought of that. My point is that there is now actual evidence that such ability exists for sure. Clapper just saying "The Russians could have done this" is just pie in the sky and couldn't be used in court, but to say "someone could have planted this stuff using these particular Vault 7 tools" IS admissible. I'm thinking the Russians would be somewhat reluctant to release their tools to Wikileaks, so our alphabet orgs had to bare their asses a bit for "the greater good."
