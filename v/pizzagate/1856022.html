<p>NorthJersey.com (a USA Today/Gannett property) reports that <em>&quot;A man dubbed “the Ramsey rapist” held 15-year-old Comey and his younger brother at gunpoint after breaking into their Allendale home on an October day in 1977, one of a string of break-ins that included the rape of two area baby sitters. The Comey brothers, locked in a bathroom while the intruder searched the home, escaped through a window, only to encounter the man again on their lawn. The brothers ran back inside the house, locked the doors and called police, setting off a massive manhunt.&quot;</em></p>

<p><em>&quot;In 1978, Reldan was charged with four counts of advocate homicidal death1 and one count of conspiracy to commit murder. <strong>The offenses were allegedly committed in December 1976, while Reldan was an inmate at Rahway State Prison.</strong> Reldan was accused of requesting another inmate and an undercover officer to rob and murder his wealthy aunt and her male companion. He was convicted on all counts in April 1978, and sentenced to concurrent twenty to twenty-five year terms on each count to run consecutive to the term he was serving at the time.&quot;</em></p>
