                Well it's nice to know that we have a mixture of younger and older folks here. We need people from all walks of life joining in this fight. These perverts raise their children to be as sick at them, so we have to try our best to raise righteous children who stand up for truth. I do not have any kids yet, but I hope that when I do, they will not be brainwashed normie sheep.

            Mr Gunk obviously reads or is a contributor to Voat/Pizzagate.
           </p>
           <p>
            A lot of his dialogue is lifted
            <strong>
             DIRECTLY FROM VOAT POSTS
            </strong>
            . Particularly his video on Madeline McCann.
           </p>
           <p>
            Not complaining; he/she needs to give credit where its due though.

             Yes.  I remember us talking about that before.  Daily Mail and others read here and the next thing we know after a Powerhouse Post, Boom, mysteriously they do an article on our post.  Hmm. Must just be coincidence.

               Yes.  Amazing.  But I guess when it comes down to it, we should be glad they are helping our cause.  But, Geeze can't you send out your own people to get stories.  Sigh.

              I always give the credit where credit is due.  I know its a lot of work researching and its not nice for people to copy and paste,but if it reaches a wider audience, I would be glad they are at least using correct information.  Mr.Gunk has 25,000 followers, I dare say a lot of them are not voat users.  carmencita have you,

              or any others that feel this way about Mr.Gunk asked him to add you as a source?  Maybe hes not aware that you feel this way since there is no copywrite on your articles.  Just trying to see it from both points of view.  👍🏻😁

               there's no excuse for it. He needs to just CREDIT VOAT. Its not my article but its an article by a VOAT USER that he has used WORD FOR WORD and is probably earning
               <strong>
                AD REVENUE
               </strong>
               for, so he needs to do the right thing.
              </p>
              <p>
               Of course, great and all of that, that he's putting it out there. Noones contesting the positives of that. But the fact remains, its plagiarism.

               Oh, my only fear is when they stretch the truth the other way.  But if they are spreading the word, that is good.  It would be nice for voat to get a little credit once in a while.  I don't care about myself getting the credit, just our cause or site.  We all should share in it.

              don't let that stop you from posting. They are always really interesting posts and we all need the UK perspective.

              The more the names are spelled correctly, the better chance they have of popping up in searches and leading folk to this site. Its ok though.

               I know, but sometimes when I look at it and even check it, it looks right to me.  I will have to maybe give it a short break and come back, then post it.  Sometimes its worse if I have been on typing so much.  :)

            Lived and worked in Hollywood for 20 years. Back then, the shear mention of his name would cause people to shutter. He is obviously not thug or big bruiser but he had SO MUCH POWER!!! He still does and I can promise you, many of you already know, that people working in that industry will just look the other way. They are cowards!  I HATE THEM!! What they did to me and others, SCUM!! You can become the enemy overnight for a loose lip comment about Spielberg. The Spielbergs of Hollywood don't do the dirty work., Oh no, but they have a tribe of muscle . PR engines and expensive suits cleaning up whatever might leak out.This goes for the Brad Pitts as well. These people have been forced on us and they are billion dollar enterprises. BOYCOTT THE OSCARS!!! That is a start. Get bumper stickers made with that rhetoric.T-shirts as well. "Hollywood is Complacent " with this discription underneath.
  "showing smug or uncritical satisfaction with oneself or one's achievements."

             We have to starve the beast to destroy it. Unfortunately, our society is so dumbed down and has been taught to idolize these "celebrities". Most people know more about what is going on in the life of whatever trendy celebrity/singer/whatever than they know about many of their family members. It's so sad and they are too stupid to see it's all a distraction, and an illusion. Too many will never wake up to the truth, but I continue to be happily surprised that so many are beginning to see through the bullshit for what it really is

              Yes, starve the beast is probably the only way to destroy it.  It is so unfortunate that the new hollywood is now filtering into Netflix.  Netflix is being fed ferociously by people, so the stupidity continues by people who think they are waking up, yet are still throwing their money at more nonsense.

              They also want people to strive to "make it big in Hollywood," when in reality, if you move there and have no family or business connections whatsoever, you'll be working at a Denny's and going to auditions for 4am TV commercials for the rest of your miserable life. Unless you already have connections, or go to Hollywood and go STRAIGHT into trying to join the Masons/Eastern Star/etc., you won't get anywhere. But they keep pushing the "if you just work hard enough" narrative, the American Dream nonsense, and it works. I lived in L.A. for five years and saw so many people in their fucking

               lord, that sounds so depressing. PStomp, you need to write a book. Yep I too have a few friends connected to the industry and of course its all who you sleep with. 'Woke' folk have known that forever, but I guess the sheeple know it now too. Question is, will anything really change or will there be some fake feeble attempts at some movements for about two seconds because life there goes right back to how it was...

             Wow, so sorry to hear all of this.  Hopefully and prayerfully, this is all going to come crumbling down AND the 'bigger they are the harder the fall'. People will start turning on each other to cover their own butts.  Please let there be enough spaces for these scumbags in prison, or on the gallows!  The public are awakening and this behaviour is coming to light and will not stay hidden. Bless you my friend, I hope we see the good guys united and bringing this criminal behaviour into the open very soon.  Thanks for sharing.

             I agree "elite" would be a better way to write it, as people know who we are talking about, but the inverted commas would give a sarcasm to the word.

            Weird detail about Spielberg and this topic:
           </p>
           <p>
            In Raiders of the Lost Ark, Indy's live interest Marion (or whatever she's called) was supposed to be only 12 years old when she first slept with a much older Indy.
           </p>
           <p>
            The actress who played her became Spielberg's wife.

             Wrong about who married Spielberg- it was Kate Capshaw not the actress who played Marion. I have heard before about the original storyline including Indy having a relationship with a very young teen. When it was discussed Spielberg allegedly didn't see any problem with it but did end up making her older so the audience wouldn't be upst

             No that's incorrect. Karen Allen who played Marion did NOT marry Stephen. That was the actress from Temple of Doom: KATE CAPSHAW. His wife before that was AMY IRVING best known for the film CARRIE.

            people dont want to believe that somebody like spielberg who has brought us all so much joy could be a pedophile ...... every time i post something about michael jacksons pedophilia i cop it from his fans ... the truth is you can have creative genius and also have a sexual desire for children ... whats more important ..... the childrens welfare is number one priority and thats where turning a blind eye in the industry has resulted in high profile abusers remaining unprosecuted

             I know, its unbelievable. Something like the parents that do not listen to their children, because they want them to be famous!  Total derelict of duty.

                 Yes!  But is there a way to stop them, Idk.  I guess we should be glad they are spreading it as long as it is in our favor or the good of spreading PG.

             Thanks for adding that link, you are another great researcher.  I will check it out soon. :)  Keep up the good work, its too late, and too vast for them to hide it anymore.  Just pray for the right judges preside in the courts and give these sickos the harshest punishments available.

              I did read this when you posted last month.  Why on earth is there so little interest in your post? it has only 15 votes, I think people are sleeping, or don't want to admit these 'talented' people responsible for great movies can be involved in these heinous crimes.  Sad :'(
