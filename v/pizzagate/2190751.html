<p>Just over a week after living through the deadliest mass shooting in modern U.S. history in Las Vegas on October 1, shooting survivor and witness Kymberley Suchomel passed away at the age of 28. Suchomel was uninjured in the shooting at the Route 91 Harvest Festival, and after the terrifying event she used her Facebook presence to contradict the official story of a lone gunman. According to Kymberley Suchomel’s posts, there were multiple shooters involved in the horrific mass shooting that left 58 people dead and 546 injured. In fact, Suchomel, who was the co-founder of the High Desert Phoenix Foundation (a charity that financially assists victims of tragedies), claimed that she and those in her party were “chased” by more than one active shooter.</p>
<p>“Bullets were coming from every direction. Behind us, in front of us, to the side of us. But I know, I just know, that there was someone chasing us. The entire time I felt this way. The farther we got from the venue, the closer the gunfire got. I kept looking back expecting to see the gunmen- and I say MEN because there was more than one person. There was more than one gun firing. 100% more than one.
   As we were running, we kept changing direction, because it felt like no matter what direction we took, we were being followed.”</p>

            Very interesting.  There is overwhelming evidence of multiple shooters.  Audio of gunfire and many eyewitnesses.  However, this is not related to pizzagate.  There are lots of other places to post it.  /pol,
            <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy">
             r/conspiracy
            </a>
            , etc.
           </p>
           <p>
            Edit:  I looked at the article, and to me the significant thing is that she's yet another person who was there saying adamantly that there were multiple shooters.  Her death honestly sounds like it was caused by the stress combined with her epilepsy and/or the pituitary tumor she was being treated for.  I don't find it likely the deep state would kill her, when there are tons of people on social media saying what she said, and killing her would just create suspicion.

             Yeah, well, it's my way of viewing things, and I know it's different than yours. I feel if Paddock has been related to #pizzagate (and he was with the Paradise Ranch and the plane registrations -- those posts were valid), then he should always be related to #pizzagate. In other word, he's vetted, he's in, he can't be out just because this particular post doesn't relate to molesting children. It is related to the LV shooting and that's part of #pizzagate because it is a false flag an part of moving their agenda along. I understand your interpretation I don't get too upset when you remove posts like this. Other ones, yes, but not these.

              There have been posts arguing there
              <em>
               may
              </em>
              be links to pizzagate, but they presented tangential evidence at best.  One post was a youtube video that made some claims about Paddock's plane, but didn't present its evidence in a way that we could verify it easily (which is suspect), and even if were true, the guy acknowledged it wasn't necessarily evidence of anything.   It's fine to post stuff that seems like possible evidence of a connection, but if we were to allow posts about every general topic someone has posited MAY be connected, that would be a really slippery slope.

               Of course not. But the post I saw was pretty extensive in tying him into human trafficking in the Philippines. Then there's the whole question of the absurd legislation that is also pizzagate. You have to know from the numerous JA political posts that a lot of us posted that their prime motive was to change laws and destroy civility. While I don't know WTH this Vegas shooting was about, I do know that a prime factor in allowing 58 people to be killed was to change the gun control laws. Taking our guns away is numero uno on the hit parade and so Paddock directly feeds into this re-legislating America.
              </p>
              <p>
               Like I said, I've always interpreted things different, but you're the moderator. If I'm going to butt heads with you, it'll be over something that I believe is fundamentally wrong. I get your perspective, and I understand there have to be boundaries. But to me, Paddock is at the heart of #pizzagate. He represents the hired mercenaries the swamp creatures we're trying to rid from politics have at their disposal. I mean, where are these "Star Whackers" that Randy Quaid talks about? Yes, some are thugs in gangs like in the Seth Rich case, but others? Why not someone that you wouldn't bat an eye at if you passed the on the street?
              </p>
              <p>
               I'm just going to have to get my ass in gear and try to find a link to positively tie him to The Cannibal Elite and pedophilia. Hopefully, it will satisfy your definition and we can all start posting up a storm about the many squirrelly things that are developing in the LV case. But to me, legislation is key to understanding pizzagate and Paddock is right in the middle of that swamp.

            Okay, so the current story being pushed is that Kymberly's epilepsy caused her death while she was sleeping, and that a seizure was more likely due to heightened stress. An example of this report can be found
            <a href="http://www.vvdailypress.com/news/20171013/reporters-notebook-remembering-my-friend-kymberley">
             here
            </a>
            I did some digging
            <a href="https://www.epilepsy.org.uk/info/triggers">
             here
            </a>
            and found this: "
            <strong>
             It’s not known exactly why stress might trigger seizures. But many people with epilepsy say that if they are feeling stressed, they are more likely to have a seizure. For some people, feeling stressed can lead to other things, such as changing sleeping or eating habits, drinking more alcohol, and feeling anxious or depressed. All of these can also increase your risk of having a seizure.
            </strong>
            "
           </p>
           <hr/>
           <p>
            A little more research into how severe epileptic seizures can be led me
            <a href="https://www.epilepsy.com/learn/about-epilepsy-basics/how-serious-are-seizures">
             here
            </a>
            and I found this statistic "
            <strong>
             People with seizures with no known cause may die only 2 years earlier than expected.
            </strong>
            " This means that, without having a stroke or brain tumour or anything similar it is unlikely that seizures would kill her at such a convenient time. Scary.
           </p>
           <hr/>
           <p>
            The website makes 3 points about how seizures can be fatal:
            <br/>
            "If seizures can’t be stopped or repeated seizures occur one right after another, permanent injury or death can occur."
           </p>
           <hr/>
           <p>
            "People with epilepsy can also die from problems that occur during or after a seizure, such as inhaling vomit. This problem can be prevented if the person is turned onto one side as soon as possible. This allows saliva, vomit, or other fluids to drain out of the mouth and not go back into the lungs."
           </p>
           <hr/>
           <p>
            "Despite the risks, it’s important for people to remember that it is not common for people to die from seizures"
           </p>
           <hr/>
           <p>
            How common exactly is an unexpected and sudden death from a seizure? Well, looking
            <a href="https://www.epilepsy.org.uk/info/sudep-sudden-unexpected-death-in-epilepsy">
             here
            </a>
            I found that the odds for an adult are 1 in 1000. Whatever the media is claiming, the haven't put much thought into it before hand. Do they really expect us to believe this? It's just far too convenient to be true.

             Epilepsy or not, it's not impossible for a younger person to randomly die, and this could just be a coincidence and not a (((cohencidence))) but with everything else that's so shady and weird about the Las Vegas shooting story, you really have to think....

             is real. Not saying that is why she died, but 1/1000 adults with epilepsy die that way.

               Good on you. It's a real condition, but doctors usually don't even mention it to their epilepsy patients because there's nothing really to do about it... They should check her medication level. IMO the easiest way to kill her off would have been to change her meds to sugar pills.

            Honestly because of how she was taken out (assuming this was the case) there would be very little trace evidence, if any, to even go off of.

            I’d love to say this is the next Seth rich case to focus on/crack wide open but without an autopsy toxicology report with definitive signs of poisoning (unlikely as many reports over the years have evidenced this can be achieved through certain compounds which are at the “disposal” of the IC/TPTB)

            Don’t think I ran more than one VPN in posting so doxx away whichever asshole(s) thinks that would be a valuable enterprise — I think 🤔 one might be surprised at the repercussions of such actions though ;)

            1 thing is like to reemphasize as I don’t anticipating posting much more today - follow Matt Couch and the America First Media group for Seth  Rich updates . Stay strong, aware and vigilant fellow PG/Deep State investigators.

             Thanks for the lifting morale and your thoughts. Yeah, they slid under the wire with this one. Someone would have to figure out how to trigger a seizure ... wait a minute! I think you can trigger seizures, but I don't think it's drug induced.

             Second |P train of thought — Without those toxicology reports it would be difficult to establish a starting point for investigation unless you had the log files from the users who visited her Facebook/social media platforms where this information was being presented as likely this was seen directly by the party responsible for carrying out the presumed “hit” or at least the party or related party in charge of ordering the “hit”.
