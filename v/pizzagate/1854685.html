<p>This is a ton of new information and I haven\'t been able to read through it all or go through social media, so I\'m asking for help. Larry king has been all but scrubbed from the internet, so these will go fast. PLEASE HELP research and archive.</p>
<p>This is pizzagate related b/c the franklin scandal is about child sex trafficking, D.C., pedofilia, child pornography, and COVERUPS.</p>
<p>I found quite a few posts on voat discussing King\'s whereabouts and he was traced to the D.C. Area working at a sterling car dealership but I didn\'t see anything past that on voat.

<p>Back to Kings whereabouts--</p>
<p>He lives in Reston, VA near D.C. His opera nova bio is how I found him and it gives us some more info on what Larry has been up to since his release from prison. He is involved in different charities including ones that work with children. His bio talks about how much he likes to help children. I am absolutely sick and shaking over this. Americans should all be OUTRAGED over what authorities allowed this man to do to our children. This monster is a free man. Will he never be held accountable for his horrific crimes?   What can we do? </p>
<p>Per his bio he works with the following organizations:</p>
<p>&quot;Since moving to the Northern Virginia Area he has serves and been consultant to several local, civic and social organization boards, including the Martin Luther King Foundation, AHEAD Inc. (Adventures in Health, Education &amp; Agricultural Development, Inc), Lift me Up (therapeutic riding program), the Sterling Foundation, the Joyce and Thomas Moorehead Foundation, the National Heritage Festival, the 30 Anniversary Slave Memorial Wreath Laying Ceremony - Mount Vernon, the Annual Washington Football Legends and Awards and, most recently, the MLK 50 Anniversary March on Washington. He also is very active in his church, Heritage Fellowship, in Reston VA, where he has served on several committees and ministries.&quot;</p>

<p>It seriously says this shit:</p>
<p>&quot;How to hook young people on classical music, including opera? Make it relevant to their lives.
That’s the thinking behind Opera Nova’s long-planned and now set-for-2017 production of Scott Joplin’s “Treemonisha,” which will be produced for schoolchildren and aims to ultimately be presented far beyond the confines of Northern Virginia.
“It’s so timely, it’s so on point,” said Larry King, an Opera Nova board member, speaking at the organization’s annual fund-raising brunch, held Oct. 9 at Washington Golf &amp; Country Club.&quot;</p>

            "Larry was selling cars up in Maryland....Mercedes gov leases. Cush job out of jail. We made calls, someone paid him a visit, freaked him out. I called last year and was told he is no longer there. Then I was told he 'checks in for any calls'. I sent the male receptionist a few email links...he had no idea! Along with that job, he was said to be organizing parties in D.C. On the up and up. .....right....So he can be found. Go through the dealership. Be creative."

            Yes 100% this is Larry King. He likely divorced his wife and she went with their son Prince King to Texas on the other side of the country to get away from him. He is likely remarried. He did time in prison and his ex wife was charged in the income tax and missing $40M Franklin Credit Union. Let's not forget that his ex wife was privy to most everything this sadistic pedofile was doing with money as they owned several houses, a private plane, etc. Larry King still owes victim Paul Bonacci $1M and not a dime has been paid, no wages garnished and this was by court order. WHY??? Interesting he was working at and owned a car dealership (as does his son in Tx currently) because this would be an easy way to launder money and hide certain transactions as I'm sure he is still highly acquainted with nefarious people.
           </p>
           <p>
            Let's not forget what this fat sack of shit, disgrace to humanity was into: Larry King was and still is a sadist pedofile. His choice were young white boys which he would violently rape. There are testimonies of him being extremely forceful and enjoying the torture aspect of the act, including beating them. He would pimp kids to "important" people and his home in Washington where they held "elite" parties where they had children in the rooms downstairs for those who wanted to partake. He also had parties in Omaha at the Towers with prominent business people and naked children, drugs and alcohol. NOW, LETS TALK ABOUT THE MOST DISTURBING FACT OF LARRY KING: He flew a young teen boy on a private plane to California and picked up a few other people on the way, one of whom was Hunter S. Thompson (who was well known to shoot child porn and snuff films), and a young 6 year old boy. They all went to Bohemian Grove to film a child porn snuff film. The boys had to wear jungle themed costumes and were raped by a large tall and big man who was extremely violent with the six year old tearing him open and he was bleeding and hysterical. The man then began beating them both, punching and kicking and then ultimately shooting the child victim in the head dead. The older boy then was forced at gunpoint on film to have sex with the dead child's corpse. He was also made to bite off the child's penis and rape his corpse with it. These acts were all the direction of none other than LARRY KING who stood by directing the snuff film smiling and laughing. When this disgusting, vile film was completed they all went somewhere to meet with the buyers of the film to watch the movie and there were more boys there wearing jungle boy outfits sitting on the men's laps while they laughed and enjoyed this morbid sickness.
           </p>
           <p>
            I AM ASKING, HOW THE FUCK IS THIS MAN NOT CLASSIFIED A PEDOFILE AND STILL WORKING WITH KIDS???  THE AMOUNT OF CHILD VICTIMS OF THIS MAN IS ASTOUNDING. THIS MAN IS PURE EVIL.
           </p>
           <p>
            To all the victims of Lawrence E. King, may peace be with you all. This movement is about each of you and you are not forgotten, your lives matter. And for the many victims who lost their lives, we will not stop fighting for justice for you all and may your precious souls rest in eternal peace.

             Thank you for your responses. He is evil. I have never heard those specific bohemian grove allegations. It's horrific. Did anyone testify to being three or seeing it?

            I've often wondered whether he molested his own son when he was growing up and what their relationship is like today. It's telling that his wife moved to the other side of the country with their son and away from him. The truth is out there and I wonder what else they know about this sick asshole. This man is pure evil.

            My God. It's him. Quick download any copy you can find of the Franklin coverup documentary that Discovery channel commissioned - then backed out last minute. As this breaks it is going to be massively scrubbed off YouTube if it isn't already.

            I cannot find a "Martin Luther King Foundation" so maybe he was referencing this place? It is located in Reston. 
A lot of links on this page (like to photo galleries) are not opening for me. Can someone else try?

            OK legit. (EDIT)  I think these two guys ARE the SAME
           </p>
           <p>
            Thomas Allen Moorehead Age 73 lived in Omaha Nebraska and runs a BMW car dealership (BMW of Sterling) out of Sterling VA
           </p>
           <p>
            Lawrence E King Jr Age 72 lived in Omaha Nebraska (obviously) and now lives in Reston VA and works at BMW of Sterling.
           </p>
           <p>
            ---could they have gone to school together?---
           </p>
           <p>
            HOWEVER.  Lawrence E. King is married to Alice P. King although they may be separated as she lives in Texas
           </p>
           <p>
            This Opera dude is married to a Veronica
            <s>
             and so he's not the same guy
            </s>
            .
            <s>
             He appears to be Larry Wilbert King Jr Age 48 .  He never lived in Nebraska
            </s>
            (different guy)
           </p>
           <p>
            HOLD UP I was just looking at the original flyer post and two things jump out the names  "the Sterling Foundation, the Joyce and Thomas Moorehead Foundation"  are in the article as well as "e is a past member of the Metropolitan Opera Advisory Board, has performed with the Reston and McLean Symphony Orchestras under the direction of Dingwall Fleary"
           </p>
           <p>
            RESTON is where Lawrence King Lives and he works for THOMAS MOOREHEAD
            <br/>
            way to much to be coincidence.
MAYBE LAWRENCE KING REMARRIED

            Hey OP, I was trying to help verify whether this is the same Larry King as the one from the Franklin Scandal.
           </p>
           <p>
            Looks like the documentary Conspiracy of Silence shows film of Larry King of the Franklin scandal singing the National Anthem,
           </p>
           <p>
            <a href="https://youtu.be/vBSIDQt5Dwc">
             https://youtu.be/vBSIDQt5Dwc
            </a>
            &lt;&lt; At about 1:37 he's singing in an Opera sort've style (I know nothing about Opera)
           </p>
           <p>
            Found reference to "Lawrence King, Jr. of Omaha, who sang the national anthem at the 1984 Republican convention in Dallas, and throughout the '80s was described as a “GOP high-roller” and “the fastest rising African-American star” in the Republican Party.""
           </p>
           <p>
            <a href="http://archive.is/DsuJg">
             From the Franklin Case.org
            </a>
            Apparently he sang the anthem in both 1984 and 1988.
           </p>
           <p>
            "8-1984 - Lawrence King throws a lavish party in Dallas, Texas, after singing the National Anthem at the Republican National GOP Convention."
           </p>
           <p>
            "8-1988 - Lawrence King throws a lavish party in New Orleans, after a return appearance to the Republican GOP Convention to sing the National Anthem."

             Ok. I'm trying. Anyone have ability to run an identity verification check? It looks like one was already requested on spokeo today. If you have this, please share. Larry e King from Reston, VA and Omaha, NE?? I think this has to be him.

              I found this New York Times article from December, 1988 in which King is described as "tall and expansive" .  It also says he is 44 years old (at time of publication), which would make him 74-75 today.   Funny though, that, no photo appears with the article --, yet a photo is credited at the end:

              :  "
              <strong>
               You will never see a photograph of Lawrence E. King, at one time one of Washington’s prominent GOP elite
              </strong>
              .  King loved photographs taken with government officials yet not one exists today.  Search the internet, this is perhaps the “least photographed person in history,” or so you would think. Karl Rove was tasked with this, hiring Michael Connell (dead in mysterious plane crash) to clean the net and several retired NYPD detectives to silence anyone who would speak out."

               Nice find! Yes he's been all but scrubbed by the internet which is why we need ppl looking into these connections asap. My post is still unverified though and a lot of ppl are likely passing over it.

                I see this thread has gone from "unverified" to "potential lead".  I honestly do not know what the difference is, but it would seem to be an upgrade. (?)  Regardless, abcdefg222, I have a super-creepy feeling that this is the one and same  King pin of the Franklin Scandal, pun intended.  When I first started reading/viewing about Pizzagate/Pedogate, one of the main things that made me a believer in very short order was the connection/similarities to the Franklin Scandal.  So I for one will do what I can to continue to investigate this angle and add to your thread as time allows.
               </p>
               <p>
                I also wanted to relate that today I recalled a book I read decades ago,
                <em>
                 The Spear of Destiny
                </em>
                by Trevor Ravenscroft. It described, among many, many, other occult/mystical/cosmic  things, how certain OPERAS contained meanings/steps in terms of initiation in the Knights of the Holy Grail.   I remember in particular reading that Hitler was obsessed with the opera,
                <em>
                 Percival.
                </em>
                because it allegedly contains codes about how to achieve spiritual enlightenment through a course of steps on what may be termed "a righteous path," but which could also be pursued through a short-cut "unrighteous"  (or dark) path.   Granted, this is a seemingly random recollection--it could certainly be a trivial detail-- but as I have not read that book in nearly 40 years,  I thought it 'interesting" in an eerie sort of way that I should recall that bit about opera-as-allegory as I thought about this thread.

It might be within the Conspiracy of Silence documentary on You Tube, OR one of the Franklin Scandal videos.    I will try to find that clip and will post it here.  I do NOT know how to archive, though.  PLEASE ARCHIVE THE ABOVE VIDEO CLIP and then perhaps we can do a voice analysis.

            Holy moly what a find! Excellent excellent digging OP! This opens tons of new doors...
           </p>
           <p>
            Imagine all the rabbit holes in the private parties and shindigs he worked for. I smell NGO celebrations and all sorts of interesting venues to look into! Any opera on any venues at the latest Pegasus museum fundraiser? Maybe wishful thinking but I predict he's been contracted out to some typical elite weird underground pagan solstice celebrations that will end up looking oddly Luciferian upon new light.
           </p>
           <p>
            Let's hope that this sub doesn't get deleted for whatever gay reason and we get enough digging on this! What's this embezzling Republican pastor bankster pedo pimp for neoconservative elites been up to lately? I'm sure probably just opera that happens to be in d.c. Ha

            This made the hair on my neck stand up.  But I concur:  Need to make sure you have the right man.  I did an image search "Larry King + Franklin Scandal"  and it sure does look like the same man, albeit somewhat lighter skinned, I think?

             It's the same guy. The images we have from the seventies are just darker, whilst this latest one has a lot of light in it. But it's definitely the same guy.

            I'm not sure you've got the right Larry King. He was spotted in Omaha by a friend of mine who lives there, working at a bank (in the back room) about 3 years ago. It's a very common name, be careful.

              The money is stored away in offshore banks he never repaid. He also owes victim Paul Bonacci one million dollars which has never been paid out not one cent. How is that possible, it's a court order but he's never had to pay him and wages were never garnished. This man should never ever be around kids. He is a sadistic pedofile.

             I think it's really him. 
All this info is for the same guy who worked for sterling for sure bc he's a part of the sterling related organizations. 
Annnnnd It looks like him, he sings, he has one son, from the heartland, he's visited and sang at the White House per this bio.

               His bio now says he's married to Veronica Evans King.
Can anyone find any divorce or marriage documentation?
