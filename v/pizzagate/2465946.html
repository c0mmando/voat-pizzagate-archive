<p>Fourth, it is self-evident that when a minor girl seeks an abortion, she represents a textbook example of why mandatory reporting laws were created in the first place.

Among all the cases we researched ¬– whether they are included in this report or not – we never found one example in which criminal charges were brought against an abortion clinic employee for failing to comply with their state’s mandatory reporting statutes. This was true even when this failure was (a) noted during the investigation and/or trial and (b) was a direct contributor to subsequent assaults on these children. In some cases, the abortion clinics flaunting of these laws even resulted in sexual assaults being committed against other underage girls.</p>

            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            In the wake of the scandal, March of Dimes released a statement saying it does not support Planned Parenthood — but confirming that five chapters do have a relationship with the abortion giant. The organization didn’t name which chapters.
           </p>
           <p>
            Here is the March of Dimes Statement
           </p>
           <pre><code>To set the record straight, the March of Dimes does not have a relationship with Planned Parenthood. Additionally, the March of Dimes does not promote or fund abortion services, nor may Foundation funds be used for directive counseling regarding abortion. Violation of this policy would be grounds for immediate cancellation of a grant or cooperative agreement. Since 2007, five local March of Dimes chapters have given local grants to Planned Parenthood exclusively for prenatal education. In these communities, these are the only such services available to improve the health of low-income women and reduce the risks of birth defects, low birthweight, and prematurity in their babies.
</code></pre>
           <p>
            Amazingly, the five chapters that support Planned Parenthood give money to a company that kills unborn babies in abortions in order to provide prenatal support for women. Never mind that approximately 95% of the pregnant women who go to Planned Parenthood go there for abortions, not prenatal care.

             The Nuova Bussola Quotidiana writes, that Katarina Le Blanc from the Swedish Karolinska Institutet, who was named on June 13th as a member of the Pontifical Academy for Life, works with human stem cells derived from aborted children.
            </p>
            <p>
             In 2013 she published with other authors an article in PLOS ONE on stem cell research based on cells harvested from killed human embryos. The Pontifical Academy for Life declared in 2000, that such research is immoral.
            </p>
            <p>
             In July 2016 Le Blanc published in Scientific Reports with others a study based on cells taken from the lungs of aborted children, purchased from the abortion-network Planned Parenthood at the price of 45 Dollars a baby.

             some of the people he chose is very questionable in regards to the Catholic Faith

              Catholics are just as dumb as any other group and are also Sheep.  They believe like I did a while back that no one would ever have the stomach to do these things.  It was just  a few months ago I finally faced it, although it was always there in my mind.  When I saw it in print.  I could no longer deny the truth about late term abortion.  Now these things just make me want to throw up.  It makes me so sick and mad at the RCC and the pope.  Liars.  All this time, they have been Liars and Murderers of the worst kind.  Real Babies.

                I guess I fell for it so long because I, like others just could not believe someone could do these things.  I am so glad I never sent PP any money.  My husband did send MOD money but I have now convinced to not send them a penny.  It upsets him because someone in our family who has passed away, had polio.  He is very upset what I have told him.  I do have to say that we have more money now that we have stopped giving to so many.  I just looked up The Carter Center and I got upset about that too now, since the CEO is a woman that belongs to the CFR Council of Foreign Relations.  God I am so sick of this.

                    The shocking amount of rapes of children in the UK have been posted on here and I think what else can happen that will shock us tomorrow.  Now I see the post of the Black Nobility and the deep down underground of the mafia all over the world.  The mafia had it's hold and then it seemed to dissipate somewhat.  What they did is burrow down.  Underground is where they went. They have joined at the hip, the Italian, Jewish and the Windsors they are all in this together that is how they have turned this into such a Rabbit Hole with Rat Lines all over the world.  It is a Worldwide Web cast over us all.

            What's missing is basic common sense.  Isn't that a given for Planned Parenthood employees that they are required by law to report abuse? It is for every other profession. There are cases where Professionals go overboard like in this case:
            <a href="http://www.freerangekids.com/dentist-reports-mom-to-cps-for-oral-neglect-yes-i-know-how-that-sounds/">
             Free Range Kids
            </a>
            . While here we have CPS doing it's job, It seems pretty easy to take a child away from a parent these days. Then we have Planned Parenthood protecting the perpetrator. Crazy stuff!

            Why report it to the police after the girl's first abortion when there's potentially much more money to be made if she's raped repeatedly?
