   Here's the troubling truth behind Pizzagate: it's driven by a pre-biblical secret society's belief in the efficacy of child sacrifice. Referred to as the Illuminati, but illuminated they are not.

            Religions and devil worship are pathetic in my opinion...what evidence are you talking about? What bigger picture? You sound like a "Christian" who is offended to read that praying to "God" gets you nothing. There's a lot more from where that came from, I was merely brushing the surface of a subject of the bigger, universal picture I call "spirituality" and the art of awakening, which has nothing to do with religions or politics. I get this reaction to various degrees, you're not the only to have difficulty in conceiving of anything outside of the picture you use as your living screen saver. Good luck, and keep an open mind. As far as I know, the truth about our origins, history and capabilities has yet to be discovered and exposed:)

            Thanks! Come to think of it, Lucifer didn't supernaturally grant Hillary the election. The mechanisms of third world regression are greed, corruption and weapons. Ask the devil to give you anything and you won't get anything. Praying to "God" for anything is an insult to all the innocent tortured or killed who were not helped by god. No one escapes their body. We are really bound by our senses and this dimension as we know it. There is more to life than meets the eye but it isn't provided by the "external" worship of nothing around ourselves. New insights can be achieved instead by focusing on removing the "obstacles" we have within ourselves that work at preventing us from experiencing a higher form of existence. We all have this potential to fully integrate ourselves not only within our bodies but also to awake  our vital energy. That's why mystics and spiritual extremists get nowhere.  They mistake the effects of mortification with progress from "God"...or they mistake the adrenaline rush from torturing others as a chin up from the devil...Lucifer is like a "Voldemort", a parasite who utilizes weak individuals to keep him alive. I am not aware of anything "supernatural" accomplished by anybody, but I am aware of countless cruel and unnatural perversions pursued by these folks in the name of...corrupted human nature at the highest. Lucifer doesn't have to do much, these folks are on it by themselves. These individuals feed on negative sources and what grows is their levels of morbidity that eventually knows no bounds. It's a process of desensitization and corruption. I'm really surprised these folks don't start eating their own stools, maybe they do already, maybe they don't, it doesn't cause anyone pain or embarrassment so they'll continue to turn their gaze outward and prey on unwilling victims to get their thrills. Nothing but sick, perverted individuals.

              Extremely seriously! The Bible tells us to "watch" several times and to be prepared for the events that are to come:
1 Thessalonians 5:6 KJV
[6] Therefore let us not sleep, as do others; but let us watch and be sober.

            Found this interesting email in the Syrian Files. It's about the Galactic federation of Light from Sirius. Talks about Spirit guides and even talks about Jesus could be a way to follow. But for them to follow this they need to get in touch with their spirit guides from Sirius...https://wikileaks.org/syria-files/docs/655379_fw-a-great-religious-resource-for-civilization-building-and.html

            Too bad all this bullshit started in the last century. They all got sold on some bullshit. Allister Crowley scammed all of the elite. The only person to do it better was Rasputin with the Russians before Crowley. All this satanic council of 9 Egyptian crap is from the 50's sold to little power hungry dipshits who joined freemasonry. The CIA actually created most of all counter culture. Why do you think people call CIA guys spooks? Because they talk about a bunch of woo-woo bullshit. Crystals and mushrooms, acid and UFOLOGISTS. All CIA spooks.

             The "Illuminati" (and precursors) has been an integral part of human history for 10's of thousands of years. The troubling Truth behind Pizzagate is that, in order to understand why there are so many freaks running the show, you have to understand that human history is complete bullshit as it is taught in schools around the entire globe, not just in the West. They crafted our religions as jokes. They eat our fucking kids. They keep secret the most beautiful truths of this Universe.
            </strong>

           <p>
            With this revelation, comes the questioning of our inherited faiths, scientism (as opposed to real science), and beliefs.

            Illuminati are who they think they are as he describes. This is written about in the Bible book of Enoch. The fallen angels who God had cast down with Lucifer created the Nephelims. This leads us all the way to Ashkenazi race located genetically in the region of khazar. They worship Lucifer and trying to bring NWO and false peace.

             I think they are referring to the Satanic Egyptian mystery religion that originated in Babylon which formed the basis of the "faith" of those who subscribe to the Freemasonry and Illuminati goals / principles.

            I just watched this .....I have to say being a Christian, I understand where he is coming from having studied the Genesis 6 account of the Son's of God, who were the Fallen Angels.....the Nephilim, who were the children of the fallen ones born from the daughters of man....that is as far as I will take it, because people tend to see a tinfoil hat wearer when talking on this subject :o).

             I'd be interested to know more.  I'm relatively new to the concepts.  Feel free to pm me if you'd prefer not discussing this in public.  Peace.

              Best book I have read on it is called: Giants: sons of Gods.
Available
At Amazon. Christian perspective
For sure. Absolutely fascinating. Skip the intro if you aren't into this as a true researcher. It's a bit "heady". But the rest of the book is outstanding.
