            It may be tiresome to you, but it's true.  There is a qualitative distinction between being attracted to a postpubescent and a prepubescent.  That doesn't mean one is good and one is bad.  It means they are different.  Hijacking someone's car vs. lying to them and persuading them to give it to you under false pretenses are different crimes.  Both are wrong, but they have different names and are treated differently because yes, they do represent different types of criminal activity.
           </p>
           <p>
            I could just as easily say that it's tiring explaining this distinction... in the end, it is important to recognize
            <strong>
             both
            </strong>
            (a) they are both crimes and (b) they are different crimes (though in the same overall category of sex crimes).

            From the LA Times
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             Detectives conducted “john” stings to target men and women involved in prostitution and posed online as juveniles to go after pedophiles.
            </p>
            <p>
             In all, 28 children and 27 adult victims were rescued, the Sheriff’s Department said in a statement. About 140 men were arrested for solicitation and 36 others on suspicion of pimping. In total, 474 people were arrested, authorities said.
            </p>
           </blockquote>
           <p>
            I just saw somewhere that they said 474 pedophiles were arrested.  That's not true.  Not every john arrest would have involved an underage prostitute.

            Nope, I disagree. There is a huge difference between a perv sexting a 15 year old and a man who is sexually excited by little children.

            I have been reading Nick Bryant's book on The Franklin Cover up.  The FBI was actively involved in covering it up. Of course, that was under HW Bush, who was allegedly involved  (and definitely friends with Larry King). But I still worry that this will be swept under the rug.

             Exactly, look at this pragmatically.  Bush had his and his entire family's rep on the line.  He had to cover it up.  What does Trump have to lose if he covers up for the pedos?  What does he have to gain?

              Behind the scenes there is a war raging between white hat agents and the dark forces. Dark forces have lost their biggest weapon - secrecy! With the Podesta emails cat is out of the bag. They have already lost, it is the begining of the end for them. White hat agents are emboldened by the fact that citizen journalists across the world are watching. It means 'suicides' are no longer viable an option. They are on the radar. Think of all the conceiled cameras by all the good guys, monitoring everything 24/7. And the top agents know this, they have no choice. The best they can hope is to do another Jimmy Saville, make Alifantus and Podestas an example to appease the citizen journalists and lay low for s while.

               I'm sure they realize that we are going naw through that bone for a couple days and then move into the next target, no?  Their only defense is a total coverup (hence the unprecidented censorship), once one goes down the whole thing crashes because suddenly you vidicated everyone who was labeled anything from all the decades of lies and deception.

                 That's the truth, I've had to learn how psycho/sociopaths operate just to understand what I'm looking at, It's very otherworldly (could be a reason why people try to excuse elites behavior as "alien")

            I think they're scapegoating Weiner. Alex Jones was obsessed with focusing on Weiner &amp; CP on Joe Rogan. Jones is totally the CIA's way of getting ahead of a scandal by associating craziness with the facts. Referring to the alleged photos exchanged as CP is also unusual to do when you're talking about one relationship and teen victim, even if it is a technically correct term. Seems like an attempt to amplify the blame. Weiner may be telling the truth when he was saying it was a hoax. He's not even considered a player with all the Dyncorp stuff. He could be an outsider who knows too much. Just food for thought. I could be wrong. But these people are fucked and it wouldn't surprise me.

             The 15 yr old stuff is just the tip of the iceberg when it comes to Weiner's laptop. This guy was heavily involved for sure. He has a long history of sexual impropriety if you look for it. This didn't just randomly appear. Also if you research his wife Huma, you will see there are direct ties with her and the Haitian human trafficking.

              There are 3 other sexting scandals starting in 2010 - but they all involved adult women. Huma is a strange bedfellow for sure. All I can say is that marriage seems to be tied to politics when you're a Federal rep. I'm not even sure Barack and Michelle were legitimate these days.

              Weiner may have been one of the only people to get that close who had a conscience so they're dumping everything on him. I'm worried he's bait. Remain skeptical.

            Don't forget the house oversight committee requesting the Clinton email Datto info from the FBI.
            <br/>
            But, to be honest, I think we are just much more likely to notice this stuff now. That California bust was part of an annual operation. Just like the FBI's Operation Cross Country that was carried out last year, it's annual, that was the 10th one, I had never known a damn thing about it til pizzagate opened my eyes to human trafficking even being a problem in the US.
            <br/>
            I like your optimism, but I think the real story here is that people are finally aware and paying attention to this news. Which will eventually lead to the real purge. It's got to.

            To put the California arrests into perspective, this was a number of arrests made throughout the investigation. Not all at once. And it was planned to have a press conference announcing the results at the end of human traffikking month. In other words, the news conference was planned to make the most of a series of accomplishments over time.

            Don't forget CEO of Voat steps down.    Not saying it is connected but - I notice these boads have changed A LOT.  Did a bunch of people get fired?   All kinds of posts that would have been taken down are now left alone.
           </p>
           <p>
            Anyone else notice it has calmed down, as well as the retreat of that crazee contingent always posting NEED HELP!!! LOOK THE SUN IS A SATAN SYMBOL?   They seem to be less active as well.
           </p>
           <p>
            Thanks for this timeline btw.  There were some other more isolated pedo busts like the Classics teacher.

             Funny you mention the classics teacher, currently finding links to him and a alleged ring within New Zealand state care during the 70's, something the former PM refused to allow investigation a day before his resignation. This teacher btw was working in NZ the same time in the same area as the supposed victims, its still very difficult to find info from that era but more info is coming out as other professional investigators are looking into only the teacher.

            </p>
            <p>
             Oh and the mainstream soros media there deleted all the articles they released last week about it, they mentioned how he started his career in New Zealand, also how former students gossiped that he was a creep, and I forgot to archive ffs.

              Check out the movie, "Hunt for the Wilderpeople" - it will trip you out. It's a complete snuffing out of the elites and their relationship with New Zealand's Child Protective Services and how they abuse the native foster kids of NZ. It's a funny movie - but it completely exposes what they've been doing for years.

            I noticed the same pattern as well. The question is will we see the big names who haven't been charged before go down? I'm talking Hillary and Podesta. I think at most Podesta will be scapegoated by the Clintons and get some weak 3 year sentence. The same goes for Weiner.

             I'll be happy if Trump can get the U.S. out of the evil "we've" been doing across the world. Thank you, George Webb.  (Though it's kinda hard to know that stuff and be powerless at the same time.)  I'm further hoping he will have an
             <em>
              honest
             </em>
             conversation with the American people and lay it out and then let the rule of law reign.   Anything short of that I'll just be glad I'm on the downhill side of this thing called life.

             The Podesta Group -- whose chairman, Tony Podesta, is a major Democratic fundraiser and the brother of Clinton’s former campaign manager -- is no longer lobbying on behalf of Google, public disclosures show. The change coincided with Google’s bid to hire someone for “conservative outreach,” according to a December job advertisement.

             Meanwhile, the change in administration is a boon to some firms. Puerto Rico Federal Affairs Administration, a group that lobbied for debt relief for the island, re-upped its contract with Prime Policy Group, where Charlie Black is chairman, the disclosures show.

             I seriously doubt it.  That book has been available online in English since 2009.  What they lost was he can now publish the book in the UK.   But some big secret is not going to be revealed when that happened.  He has already made his views known.

              You would think women of all people would be the most outraged by pedo rings (no offense men, I love you), but you would also think that women of all people would be against killing their own baby. I guess when women have been brainwashed to not connect with their own offspring you really can't expect them to give a shit about other children.

            I would take a second look at the LA badge and it's boy lover symbol. Most likely that investigation and bust were controlled opposition. They're trying to keep a serious federal investigation from happening. And yes, I know the FBI was involved, but not at the level they actually should be.

             I was a little swayed at first but pulled back.  With so much press about all of the captures of pedos and victims it is important to keep a cooll head.  I am waiting for the red pill of the century. Am still trying to do more work on St. Louis and Archdiocese.

              Glad to see you're staying with the fight. Keep on it. I believe the Red Pill is on its way. I'm half hoping they do a fake bust in St. Louis because of the info that would drop in response to that. Hint. They called me a wolf before, and they were right about that, but for the wrong reasons. I can track, and I know the woods here well. They don't know what I've found or what I've dug up. My wording is important here.

               Trying to catch your drift.  I am at a standstill because for some reason I am stuck on trying to find out who deeded the land to the Archdiocese.  I have not heard of any press ops in Miami, or Chicago (which I think is a real hub as well with O'Hare and the Chicago Archdiocese.  I think they are all connected in a way.  I am convinced that bodies or parts of bodies have been taken to West Lake Landfill.  I almost laughed when the New Orleans press included the Pope in their message.  It is so very obvious that they are involved.  John Pall II and Pope Benedict XVI.  That is why he is in a fortress locked up and guarded by the Mafia.

             Always pay attention to who's busted and who isn't. 500 is a good haul, but they may be small fry. I mean, they should all fucking die, but we still need the big fish up on the bench, head removed and filleted.

             imo, pizzagate was the perfect coincidental choice it turned out to be. It is when the world discovered these fux were using a code. as soon as someone enters this research, they find that something as innocent as pizza means something so vile, and then all these associations begin to pop up in popular culture. It is a great Door name to enter this world. The main course will be Weinergate. When the world pedo crimes are included, then it should become Pedogate. I just remember the jolt i experienced when the reason it was named pizzagate was explained. The world changed on a dime. It is never forgotten.

             PizzaGate is like "Jeet Kune Do": just a name.

             "I have not invented a "new style," composite, modified or otherwise that is set within distinct form as apart from "this" method or "that" method. On the contrary, I hope to free my followers from clinging to styles, patterns, or molds. Remember that Jeet Kune Do is merely a name used, a mirror in which to see "ourselves". . . Jeet Kune Do is not an organized institution that one can be a member of. Either you understand or you don't, and that is that. "

              It ruined it for me. The other day me and my girlfriend went out for a pizza, and while eating I suddenly felt ill. I went out for a fresh air. Finished the pizza after all.

               Like it even less when Sophia Smallstorm describes how a slice of pizza rolled into a cone looks like looking at the crust end with cheese and sauce visual.  Hence the code word.  I don't eat it in this manner but know it is by others.  I reeled on that one!

              I feel bad for Nixon having to share the same -gate suffix with Hillary.  His corruption was pretty standard political stuff compared to the evil committed by Hillary.

               That's kinda the point.  By saying Benghazi-gate it makes it clear, if they can take down Nixon over that shit then these people can get taken down for worse stuff.  The -gate suffix is a nice way to remind people that the politicial elite should not be held to a different standard of justice.

               Talking about Nixon, he was set up because TPTB (Rockefeller, etc) probably couldn't blackmail him so had to set him up to get impeached.  A lesson they learned well, now almost everyone is blackmailable, many thanks to all the pedophile rings:

               No it wasn't. This has to be the most uneducated group of people short of the Donald. I'm official done here. It's sad that place as mainstream as voat, is over run with uneducated, tunnel visioned, partisaned, sock puppets. If my statement makes you mad then yes I'm talking about you. You need to realize that watching one news source (clearly fox for the majority here) means you're part of the problem. You, along with the ultra left, are what's wrong with this country and why shit like this exists. While you're busy having temper tantrums about each other the real people in power laugh, but 10 more roles Royce, fuck a few slaves, and never give you another thought. STOP BEING TRIBAL MONKEYS. HUMAN TRAFFICING ISNT ABOUT TEAMS. ITS NOT ABOUT YOU BEING RIGHT ABD SOMEONE ELSE BEING WRONG.

                What are you talking about?!  We've brought up the Bushes and Cheney.  We've been looking into Scalia and McCain.  It's the left that doesn't believe it's true.

               <p>
                Many here are Trump supporters, but that doesn't mean we have tunnel vision and are uneducated!  You are very out of line!  Get off your high horse.

               <p>
                We're fighting for the TRUTH and the CHILDREN and are sick of the left silencing us!  That's why we don't watch the left channels.  They're pedo protectors.  They are trying to discredit our investigation.
               </p>
               <p>
                Get over yourself and your politics!  There is NOTHING more important to fight for right now.  NOTHING.  The fight for these children is even more important than the fight against ISIS.  Wake up!  I'll say it again: GET OVER YOURSELF!

                Um, I never thought it was about teams.  Down below I even said that it was possible that Nixon was a pedophile as well.  I just think it is dumb that we act like a case where someone spied on their political enemies is the ultimate example of political corruption when so much worse stuff has happened.  But anyway, bye.

                 I would save your concern.  I was terrified for a minute that I had somehow scared off some wiz investigator.  It turns out he is just some shill who goes around saying "but Republicans have pedophiles too!" as if anyone suggested they didn't.  He hasn't made any discoveries or found any useful information.

               Have you researched Fiona Barnett's  survivor story?    She was a smart little kid and an even smarter adult, who  drew pictures of Nixon as one of the politicians  who performed sex on her.  Hillary and Richard may not be very different when the truth is outed. ....   problem is outing the truth with those cover-uppers.

                I hadn't heard about Fiona but it isn't too shocking, sadly.  I figured the pedophilia and rapes in politics had been going on for some time but that it had reached a new peak fairly recently and wasn't quite as bad in the past.  Probably not the case though.  It is a shame.

              The severe charges/rumors thereof are designed to turn the screws on Weiner.  They're letting him know that if he doesn't flip he's going down on the hardest possible charges.

              I don't see Weiner as a pedo though. I mean, there is a lot of difference between sexting a 15 year old who is sexting you back with videos of her doing freaking things and the CumPandas of the CPP crowd diddling little toddler boys.
             </p>
             <p>
              Make no mistake, Weiner is obviously wrong for doing that. He could find plenty of 18 year olds who would have been willing. But it seems to be less pedophilish than the men out there raping toddlers.

               That is why when someone is charged with raping or molesting a minor you will see the age range included: "child under 12", vs "child under 16" for example. The younger the ages the stiffer the penalty typically. So while wiener is a defenerate pervert, being attracted to post pubescent girls is classified differently than being attracted by pre pubescent children.

               I'm pretty sure there are two separate sext pics that Weiner sent-one in his underwear with his infant child in bed beside him. I thought it was super creepy, then saw the more recent one and again, he's got his kid in his arms.  This time while hes got his muscle shirt pulled up showing his abs.

                If he sent that to a grown man I could buy that he's a pedophile. I think he's just a deluded and oversexed run of the mill pervy guy.

               According to what was leaked by NYPD there was some really nasty crap on Weiner's laptop. The 15 yr old sexting was the lesser of his crimes according to insiders. Either way he is a predator. I would be willing to bet that 15 yr old had been abused before which is why she was acting like that with a grown man. Girls won't seek out men as old as he is without having been sexually abused in the past. I could see your argument if Weiner was in his 20's but he is definitely a predator.

                He's a fantasy predator, but I don't think he's a pedophile.

                Well yeah. He is an old ass married politician dude, and texting a 15 year old. That's no normal cheating on your wife that's sexual predator.
