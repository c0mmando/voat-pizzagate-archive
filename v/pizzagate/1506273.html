             If that were true this investigation would never have got started - there has to be actual evidence before people will commit their time and energy on getting to the bottom of the story.

              And this is why we strongly recommend being extremely careful to protect your identity. If you're just reading stuff on the internet, you'll be ok. If you get a videotape of a senior official doing something to kids, things could get dicey. We think at least one person has already been killed (in Haiti) in connection with this.
             </p>
             <p>
              Not fear-mongering. Please continue investigating. But just be very careful.

            The internet will make a difference today because of all the citizen investigators all over the world working on this.  The information can be found, gathered, researched and archive in far less time than ever before.  Look at what has happened since this investigation of PizzaGate began.  The elite are on the run.  They are panicking. Jennifer Palmeri from DNC broadcasts, "if you read something crazy on Wikileaks in the next couple of days, don't believe it."  Russians are doing all this, blah, blah, blah. Alefantis whining to anymore who will listen to his story; now we have Fake News and the hits keep coming. I don't think enough people knew about Neil McClanahan's story as well as the world knows about this story and it continues to wake up to PizzaGate!
