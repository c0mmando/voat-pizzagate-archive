            Oddly enough, that actually makes sense. So the "free range chickens" are not chickens, they are "free range children". Am I right, Brain Dare?

            Ok, their "contact" photo is a bit creepy given the chicken context. Shirtless young boy staring into the camera holding a chicken.
           </p>
           <p>
            The fact that they have a butterfly and a heart-within-a-heart "chicken bracelet" is also a red flag. Oh, and how the hell do you make enough money selling leg bracelets for chickens to maintain a business?

             I haven't looked at their website yet as I need to fire up the proxy, but I think I know the image because it's on their Facebook page as well (which now has a lovely FBI image attached to it). Is it something like a 3-year-old? If that's the one, he doesn't look topless, it actually looks like he might be naked (with the chicken obscuring any further obscenities). Your point is spot on - that does not look like a viable money-making scheme in and of itself, so it smacks of a front. The fact that the individual who posted a picture of normal chickens with those bracelets deactivated their account minutes after I posted the FBI logo, means they absolutely shat themselves. I wonder why, huh?
            </p>
            <p>
             Okay, I'm not seeing the image on their website. Yanno, I think they've removed it from their Facebook.
