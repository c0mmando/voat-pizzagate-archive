            Many recent migrants to Sweden say that they are under age and are allowed in as unaccompanied minors, but medical tests, and often simple inspection, show that they are closer to thirty.

            You are aware that the entire refugee crisis is within a global agenda!!! Swedish politicians are bought by globalists.
They do this to promote Neo-Nazism parties in Europe among other things.
           </p>
           <p>
            "Swedish democrats party /SD" that is lead by Jimmy Åkesson belongs to the same agenda!! This is a party has ties to Neo-Nazism. 
These are the people that the globalists want to run Sweden in 2018. The globalist´s want the swedes to believe.. that they need Nazis to change our immigration policy !? .... Wake the fuck up Sweden!!

             The fuck are you on about? SD has no ties to nazis. I can say that as an actual national socialist living in sweden. If you even breathe in the same direction as a natsoc SD will disown you and smear you in the media.
            </p>
            <p>
             The media plays the nazi angle when it comes to SD just like they did Trump. SD is infiltrated by zionist jews just like the Trump admin, except Jimmy doesn't seem to have any power to resist them like Trump does.
            </p>
            <p>
             Also, it's SWEDEN democrats, not Swedish democrats. Get it right. The name is also a clue to what they are (Democrats. National socialists are not democrats).

              It is two ends of a horse-shoe. The national socialists are the same as the communists that they want to suppress free thought and free speech. To that end they will achieve control over their population. For the current Swedes they want to import mass immigrants that they can control forever and keep them in power by voting for the left. They will stay in power until the money runs out, which it always does. By that time there will be too many 3rd world immigrants and Sweden will never recover.

               Why would eradicating the nordic races be the goal of nazis? If anything, the national socialists in sweden would've just let things go on as they were since they had already implemented some of the most beloved ideas from their own ideology. The concept of "folkhemmet" is a national socialist construct, developed by studying the government and party of Adolf Hitler.
              </p>
              <p>
               Communists and Capitalists are not the same, but they both sacrifice homogeneity for the sake power and profit. Guest workers have been heavily used in most communist regimes, in an attempt to dilute the populace and make their resistance weaker. The same can be said for capitalistic regimes. Migration is a tool they both use to shift the demographics to their favour. Democracy is the only system that rewards traitors for killing off their own people. Since every migrant is another vote cast to maintain the system as it is. National socialists reject migration as both unnatural and harmful.
              </p>
              <p>
               You say migrants are a tool for the left to stay in power, then why did the previous, right wing government keep the borders open? The right wing coalition were in power as this nightmare scenario began, and they loved the migrants since they could suppress wages with "humanitarian" excuses. It would also put so much pressure on swedish welfare that it would eventually collapse.
              </p>
              <p>
               Both the left and the right want to destroy the current swedish nation. They both work to genocide the nordic peoples through migration, the only opposition is in danger of being

Björn Söder's e-mails are not the only example of when the party's rågång was wrecked. In 2003, the party was contacted by the Belgian anti-Semitist Bernard Mengal, who offered to fund a large postal mail.

               Isn't it interesting how SD hates these people? You also forgot to mention Par Oberg, who's a top ranking member of the Nordic Resistance Movement, and he was elected on an SD ticket. He's absolutely hated by SD. SD is one of the leading voices in trying to

                  I am not going to engage you anymore. To point out.. You don´t disagree with names that i posted are connected to Nazi ideology. Instead you just say that SD don´t like them.. OK? do that change that they have Nazi ideology in their party. Kind of naive thinking if you ask me.

                   SD has a zero tolerance policy on natsoc thought. Naturally they recruited nationalists when they were small, since only the most dedicated nationalist would offer the lever commitment and energy needed for a small, new party. As they grew, they became increasingly infiltrated by moderates, and since they were democrats, as soon as the nationalists were outnumbered they became the target for expulsion.

                   You're purposefully muddying the waters about SD ideology. The Social Democrats (S) have the exact same history. They went on study tours to the third reich, large swaths of the politics that got them so beloved in the first place was lifted wholesale from the NSDAP.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   Ask yourself this "If SD is a nazi party in secret, would they go out of their way to try and

                   Yes. Since by that logic, both S and C would be considered nazi parties, since they have both had nazis within their ranks and lifted policies from the NSDAP.

                     The Nordic Resistance Movement is bigger than ever, and holocaust "denial" is becoming the counter culture of the youth. Generation Zyklon is growing up more ticked off about multiculturalism than any generation before them.

                     S and C both knew that the Jews were behind the banks and the media worldwide, they just thought they could stay democratic and still resist their influence. They were wrong. Today Sweden has a Rothschild controlled central bank, and Jews control or outright own most of the media in the country. Marxist ideology has invited communist concepts, like "political correctness" and "racist". Even "Vardegrund" is typical communist doublespeak, it's simply cultural marxism rebranded as swedish ethics. Jewish intellectuals don't care what the goyim call their ideology, as long as the goyim are subservient.

                     Since the 70's, the Swedish government has been infiltrated. That's when our Constitution was changed from an ethnocentric one to a multicultural one. Before that,

                      They're the biggest fucking party in the country!
                     </strong>
                     They have all kinds of nutjobs in their ranks at this point. If they were Nazis, then I'd be a member of their party, and I'd be working my butt off to get them into power. Since they're not national socialists, and they're FOR immigration, then they're just as much traitors as the rest of the political parties. Why would SD want MORE immigration if they were national socialists? That's against the core concept of the ideology. Don't forget the large numbers of founding and prominent SD party members that have been kicked out and turned on their former party for being infiltrated garbage.

                     It would be like calling all the lefty parties full on communist, since they have actual communists in their ranks. They might be marxists, and they might pull in a communistic direction, but calling them communist outright would be inaccurate. There are communist organizations in sweden, and they're not fans of S either.

                      When you talk about Jew ´s running most of the media and information platforms and banks. That sadly say a lot about you and you narrow knowledge about the nazis-ideology ´s origin and your view on jews b/q they run alot of the media and banks. I agree the "Jews" that own and run the banks and media are bad, but that don´t justifies genocide of a people b/q of a belief (!?)

                        I see you do know a little about the satanic culture in the Jew´s side. But you dont want to see that the Nazis had the same belief. Check out Peter Levenda, Sinister force book. he did a lot of research on the third rich and there occult connection.

                        They put everyone ells against each-other. Christians against Muslims, white against black, etc..  " It´s the Hidden hand that controls the world" "The greatest trick the devil made is that convinced the world he didn't exist." Thats my view..

                         I had the same ideas as you at one point. I thought Jews were a silly scapegoat, but the Jewish race is the source of these secret societies. It's an evolutionary strategy. They have a very strong in-group preference. A "regular" jew, will always side with another jew if it's to their benefit, regardless of laws and morals. So when (((freemasons))), (((pedophile rings))) and (((bankers))) try to capture politicians through blackmail, they will naturally ally with each other due to their Jewish backgrounds. Jews found guilty of pedophilia, murder, threats, extortion ec, will still be accepted among their own. The (((press))) will even avoid writing about these people as to avoid public outrage. Jewish crime is regularly covered up, as can be seen in the 2008 financial collapse. The (((bankers))) are a protected class,  not due to wealth, but due to allegiance to the Jewish race.

                          The Satanist Jews´are a part of the problem. But they aren't the only ones. This a much bigger problem as i pointed out before.

                          I do see where you are coming from tho" and how you could see it like that. But that is just a little to narrow thinking. It sadly not that easy to just blame the Jews.

                           Clearly wrong, as national socialism was around before the Thule Society. And I only pointed out one of the earliest national socialist parties, the ideology was around before a party formed around it. Your style of arguing reminds me of the following quote.
                          </p>
                          <blockquote>
                           <p>
                            "First they counted on the stupidity of their adversary, and then, when there was no other way out, they themselves simply played stupid. If all this didn't help, they pretended not to understand, or, if challenged, they changed the subject in a hurry, quoted platitudes which, if you accepted them, they immediately related to entirely different matters, and then, if again attacked, gave ground and pretended not to know exactly what you were talking about. Whenever you tried to attack one of these apostles, your hand closed on a jelly-like slime which divided up and poured through your fingers, but in the next moment collected again. "

                           You need to stand by your own statements, and back down if you can't defend them, otherwise this whole exercise is pointless. Grow a fucking spine and stop dodging.

                           . Unless you have something more substantial than some lovecraft plagiarist, you're not going to convince me of anything. If you're going to refer to a third party, at least present their arguments for me, I'm not going to read through a bunch of horseshit just because there might be a nugget of truth there. Point out exactly what you want me to respond to, otherwise fuck off with those lazy fucking arguments.

                             movements at the time? Socialism today means simply marxist socialism, but a hundred years ago the Marxist school was opposed by nationalists, and they coined the term "national socialism" to emphasize the national unity between classes. Marxism entails international unity within one class (workers) against all other classes. The national socialists would rather have rich and poor living in harmony with each other within one nation, instead of bloody international revolutions, killing off the best and the brightest for the sake of "equality".
                            </p>
                            <p>
                             A national socialist wants the best and the brightest to work hard and become rich, while the community enjoys the additional products, jobs and technology. A marxist wants to eliminate all differences between the rich and the poor, even if it means holding the best back, and raising the incompetent up to their level.

                             Never said they didn't. Again. words matter, pick them with care. Thule society was occult, but that doesn't mean it was satanic. They were the equivalent of those practicing forbidden archeology today. They believed the european race had a much richer past then we do today. These occults beliefs were somewhat vindicated by the Oera Linda (nickname Himmlers Bible). You can find the book and read it online, it's pretty fascinating. There's even a Red Ice Radio episode about it that I recommend.

                             Thulean society were like the Randall Carlson of their time, or Graham Hancock. They believed in Ultima Thule, or the edge of the world, a big landmass that was the original home of the Aryan race. We call it Atlantis today after the description of plato. Graham Hancock calls it a progenitor civilization or something of the sort (Not my area of expertise, I might be slightly off).

                             You've read too many science fiction books, occult simply means hidden, and while some occult groups are highly suspect (freemasons), others are simply underground because their ideas go against the norm of the present day. Like the people practicing forbidden archeology, that was pretty fucking occult for awhile, now it's breaking into the mainstream.

The person behind this website copied the title word-for-word (which is a shame because I actually mistranslated one word) and added some more info in the article. If Amino69 isn't the person who wrote the article, there is no faggotry since it's unreasonable to expect all Voaters to know of all posts at all times.
