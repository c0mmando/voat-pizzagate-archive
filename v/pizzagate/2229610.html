            Virtually every claim on that page is false.  The claims that are true have nothing to do with Clinton.  See this thread for a thorough debunking all these points.  I specifically disprove the idea that Clinton had a long interest in Silsby.  That is based on the fact that Wikileaks has the date of a document wrong in their database.  It's also not an email but an email attachment and I show exactly where the document comes from and proof that the document was written in 2010 and not 2001.

            In fact, Silsby was convicted and at the time Hillary Clinton was being criticized by Baptist officials not getting involved.

             State Department rebuffs call for Clinton intervention in Haiti case
            </p>
            <p>
             Secretary of State Hillary Clinton will not get directly involved in the case of the 10 Americans detained in Haiti on child abduction charges, a State Department spokesman said Tuesday.
            </p>
            <p>
             "It would be highly unusual for the secretary of state to intervene in a case involving the judicial process of another country," spokesman P.J. Crowley said in an off-camera question-and-answer session.
            </p>
            <p>
             Reginald Brown - the Washington lawyer who represents one of the detained Americans - sent a letter to Clinton on Tuesday asking her to personally intervene with Haitian authorities.
            </p>
            <p>
             "This is all the result of a colossal misunderstanding and we are hoping it will resolve itself," Brown said about the arrest and detention of his client, Jim Allen, and the other nine Americans. "We would appreciate it if you could continue to devote significant personal attention to this matter, as we are confident that with your assistance this misunderstanding could be quickly resolved."
            </p>
            <p>
             He asked Clinton to make "a personal request" to Haitian authorities to allow Allen to speak to his wife and her lawyers and to have fresh supplies.
            </p>
            <p>
             "As far as I can tell, the one thing our detained American citizens have been able to do is communicate with just about anybody who wants to talk with them," Crowley said at the State Department. "If family members wish to talk to them, I think that is something that can be easily facilitated through our embassy in Port au Prince or through the Haitian government."
            </p>
            <p>
             The State Department continues carefully to defer to Haitian authorities.
            </p>
            <p>
             "We have had regular consular access and meetings with the 10 American citizens," Crowley said. "I believe we have facilitated getting medicine or other needs to our citizens. We are doing exactly what we would do with detained Americans any where in the world.
            </p>
            <p>
             "As to intervening directly in the case, we are very respectful of the Haitian government and of Haitian law."
            </p>
           </blockquote>
           <p>
            ...
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             The State Department also has ruled out any special role for former President Bill Clinton in a possible release of the Americans.
            </p>
            <p>
             "It is unnecessary for former President Bill Clinton to play the role of intermediary as he did in North Korea in the case of the journalists being held," Crowley told CNN on Monday. "The situation in North Korea and the situation in Haiti are dramatically different. In Haiti there is a functioning government with which we have diplomatic relations and established channels to monitor and deal with bilateral issues. North Korea is an opaque society with which we have no diplomatic relations."
            </p>

             Both of your claims are false.  You have zero evidence Clinton did either of those things.  Moreover there's plenty of evidence she wouldn't need to.
            </p>
            <p>
             Why would the Justice Department be on Silsby's back?  She committed a crime in Haiti, was convicted by a Haitian court and served her time in Haiti.
            </p>
            <p>
             Why do you think Clinton had anything to do with Silsby's job.   She was hired by a private company.
