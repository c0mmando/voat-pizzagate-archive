Her most recent Executive Producer credit was from an Italian doc about some famous editor-in-chief of Vogue magazine called <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt5317286/?ref_=nm_flmg_prd_1">&quot;Franca: Chaos and Creation</a>.  Upon opening the page I was immediately greeted with a familiar name listed first among the \'stars:\'  Marina freakin\' Abramovic (i realize her name is listed first because of alphabetic order, but still..)
Perusing her <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0009127/?ref_=tt_cl_t1">page</a> reveals a quote i haven\'t seen pointed out yet in this investigation (forgive me if this has already be covered):</p>
<p>Personal Quote: [2012] &quot;<strong>They are investigating my brain and finding out about brain function. They are going through the data now and, in November, we will have a huge symposium on the results. I have a brain that functions completely differently from other people\'s brains.

<p>What in the sam hill is she babbling about?  Apparently the quote is from her 2012 <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2073029/?ref_=nm_knf_t1">doc</a> &quot;Marina Abramovic: The Artist is Present&quot; (has anyone watched it and could comment?  i don\'t think i could stomach it..)</p>
<p>Also check out the top user review:  &quot;I can\'t even find words to describe the emotion, the feeling of peace, serenity, harmony that we feel as watching this beautiful documentary. It simply shows us the essence, the genuineness and purity of this fabulous artist! GREAT WOMAN, no doubt! I wish I was one of those that had the opportunity to sit in front of her! This is art, and anyone can\'t say that it\'s not! Certainly you\'ll never find someone so much present, so much human, so much given to the feelings of others, such as Marina! And that\'s for sure!!! Thank you, thank you so so much! You\'re simply UNIQUE! I truly wish to know her better now!!! <strong>And her institute, oh the institute!!!!

            Interesting that you said  slowness and attention.   Recently on this forum I watched her interview from Sweden.   She walked  in slo-mo on stage, had to pick up the pace because it's limited time interview and commented on the slow motion walk.  She is very attentive and she spoke of energy.  I could tell you used this as a presence.   All I could think of is that she is a energy vampire sucking it all up with a a straw.

            People like the idea of controlling others and having power and control in their own environment and being the center power figure.  No doubt these types draw to people like that like moths to a flame.

              This is the truth. Some know they are being controlled and don't care.  Some even prefer this.

              This is  aspect of groomed behavior   shows up in child pedo grooming and is similar in all other areas as well.

            As I understand it the chem trails are nano particles that enter our bloodstream and stay there and "they" have remote control over them in our system so they can manipulate them. They go to our brains and can control and regulate our thoughts and emotions and make us do things we would not ordinarily do as I understand it. This is all happening to us right now. They can brain map us completely etc. Sounds far fetched and crazy but I now believe it 100%.

             Yes and no one seems to want to tackle the chem trail world.  No one will own up to it.  It's all a conspiracy theory they say but we know different.

             You know, I used to believe that too, a long time ago. But the more I learned about these matters, the more I have grown skeptical of these claims. I'm not denying "paranormal" powers exist, and that, indeed, there are (conscious) forces beyond our perception that we are able to call upon (I've had some uneasy experiences with these), but 99.99999% of what I've seen/experienced/read boils down to mind/neurological/ego manipulations that are usually so incredibly base, people simply cannot believe they can be so easily fooled.
            </p>
            <p>
             And as for the "real" powers out there, I've personally concluded that these are just not to be meddled with. The problem is: we are only human, with a fragile human body, and a very crudely evolved tiny little human brain. And just like our bodies won't survive living on the moon, or at the bottom of the ocean, our minds are simply unable to cope with the vast information/consciousness/energy-matrix that conjures forth the illusion of the Universe we appear to exist in. Narcissistic occultists are keen to claim "divine" powers, and consider themselves Gods among men, but that is, of course, a pathetic and childish fantasy. No-one is a God, because we are physically, ethically, emotionally, intellectually, neurologically and spiritually not equipped to be a God.
            </p>
            <p>
             In my experience, people who are actually capable of true "superhuman" manipulations, keep very very silent about it, and help humanity in silence. Vanity is, by far, the Devil's favorite sin.

              I can agree with that, but I also think that the ones who are capable of such manipulations and keep very silent about it are not always there to help humanity.  Not at all.  What about CERN for example?

             It makes sense why 'The Colour of Pomegranates' is Marina's favourite film, it is extremely Satanic conceptually.  The blasphemous imagery and defilement of a Christ figure is indicative of the Jewish hatred towards Christianity and its moralism.  Christ is regarded as anathema and also the essence of opposition to Jewish oppression and supremacy, therefore it is of the utmost importance to the Jews to undermine, denigrate and ultimately destroy his identity in the consciousness of the goyim.  There is also a strong Khazarian cultural element to the film and if you know religious history, you will have encountered the name Sabbatai Zevi and the significant part he played in the development of our now debased and degenerate Western societies.

            Exactly! And, what's more, there are numerous non-verbal signals/stimuli that humans are very vulnerable to. Sure, our brain responds to language and logic, but our ability to deal with this information is, from an evolutionary point of view, rather "new". However, our nervous system has evolved over a long time, and is still highly susceptible to many different kinds of non-verbal stimuli: stimuli that will trigger a very powerful response: size, color, light, darkness, fear, smells, rhythms etc. etc.
           </p>
           <p>
            For example, your nervous system will respond if a person much taller than you suddenly stands up. Even though you might not consider yourself intimidated on a rational level (maybe you know this person very well), your nervous system
            <em>
             will
            </em>
            trigger a short fight-or-flight-reaction. It's the reason why leaders always seek to build ever taller buildings, in which they wish to occupy the top floor. We cannot help feeling intimidated by people or objects or buildings that loom over our heads. These processes are hard-wired into our bodies; it's what occultists refer to as "lesser demons".
           </p>
           <p>
            Many who study the occult will learn how to work with these triggers, and will discover how these triggers are used against us almost permanently. Go watch commercials, or visit any religious or political lecture/speech/service ... you'll find yourself bombarded with these kinds of triggers almost permanently. R.A. Wilson's "Prometheus Rising" offers a good read on this phenomenon.

            Agreed.  Now I understand why several of my highschool teachers spent a week on teaching us about cults and how to spot them in order to not get sucked into one.  Our religion teacher touched on the topic first, which made sense, but I remember being annoyed thinking why is my civics teacher now teaching this, then the next year wondering why my history was, then being super annoyed when my literature teacher started up on cults.  I now see that they weee good teachers who prepared us well

             Just ask founder of Shambala Meditation, Choygam Trungpa Rinpoche (oh, he's dead now from cardiac arrest at 48, from being an alcoholic) and his sidekick Osel Tendzin (who died of aid/hiv, but not before giving it to a bunch of his students).  Ask any older student of Trungpa about his drinking and they will say, "it's not for me to question."

              yes, I see it in most settings.  The  ''think create positive''  group takes this to programming extremes, for example, rather than identifying something  along with its result, formulating a healthier approach to achieve healthier results at the root, many of these  groups  advise the person to turn off the part of their brain that views it as negative.  It's all the  persons fault for viewing it as negative, recommending that if you just think more positively everything will be better.
             </p>
             <p>
              This compartmentalizes and causes people to be positive in the midst of negative, rather than  getting to the root and changing it.   It disorients a person similarly as if you were spun around in circles and brought to a stop, not knowing  up from down, left from right.    I recognize media propaganda and politicians plying the same technique by disorientating a person, keeping them focused on the positive thing,  the acquisition of consuming more, or ignoring the thing that could be addressed and changed.   Like you said,  these leaders are usually hiding with drugs, sex or other types of addictive  consumption, money materialism power consumption,  to pretend they are happy and positive because they're busy denying and ignoring the real root of the issue, and standing up to make necessary changes or identification of what's really going on.
             </p>
             <p>
              It's alive and well in politics and all types of belief systems.  We have a large civilian population of  ''don't ask don't tell', or the ostrich syndrome.

            These people think they are gods or something special...no joke..they convince each other of their "powers"...would not be surprised if some supernatural ability...but if they could rule the world they would be, so minor at best...big G God made us good/evil..service to self/service to others..I think we will soon learn much more about that dichotomy...

            This quote may refer to trauma based mind control (TBMC). It seems to be, that if TBMC is done to children they show higher alerted senses. Cathy O'Brien referred to that, too, I think. It is visible with photographic memory, f.e.. Another example is, that people having endured TBMC have a much better perception. You may think of it as like the brains filters for perceptions are altered somehow. One result may be, that if you look at something, the normal organized brain switches off 90% of the perceptions, i.e. in the woods, you would perceive only the trail and some details of some plants. While your eye catches much more. It catches details of every plant, of every corn of sand of the trail - you get the idea. Most perceptions the brain deems unimportant (distraction) and shuts them down therefor. A brain of one suffered TBMC or other severe PTSD may be normally under such a high degree of stress, that it filters out much less, to provide the brain with information to compute, in order to not have to process the TBMC state of being. Many ppl suffered TBMC have high abilities in many regards. It looks like as if the brain simply gets used to processing more information to avoid the processing of the endured TBMC.

             TBMC is alive and well in government.   These politicians  have the ability to reduce inflation and provide a ratio of living wages, but they don't.
            </p>
            <p>
             They have the ability to provide  healing medication, but they don't.  I just read the  Marijuana Manifesto to see how the political powers could use high ratios of  cannibidol  to cure most illnesses, but instead they illegalize it until the  patent comes up in a few years, at which time they'll use their pharma companies dominate synthetic  cannibidol and pocket the assets as they've done in other incidents time and time again.   Instead of creating a healthy food standard, they allow toxic substances to further  destroy civilians.   It provides the bases for TBMC.
            </p>
            <p>
             They exchange the health of the citizens for their own money and power and they can't get either money or power unless they have people whipped into an emotionally confused frenzy while relying on them as  doing the right thing.
            </p>
            <p>
             Then they ply people with controlled propaganda and people bow their head and agree.
             <br/>
             It's like the  horrible story of the frog boiling in the water....  the frog is put in cool water and heated up gradually.  When it begins to boil it can't jump out.

             At least the ppl I have made contact with, that suffered forms of TBMC did all show advanced perceptions of some kind. Be it photographic memory, be it high social skills, or mind reading, or alike. Someone explained, that those children would develop high skills in reading body language and analytic skills of speech/intention in order to protect themselves if their handler/torturer enters the room to be prepared not to say something offending or act in any offending manner whatsoever. The expressed views are only what this logically could be. The quote from Abramovic just fits in perfectly.

            This is what too much money gets you.  Bored, dazed and totally confused.  Beyond sick in the head.  They think because they have so much money they should be doing something that others are not.  Something that costs a ton of money.  That makes it acceptable.  You are in that special club that no one else can get into.  We have heard many times on here, They are in a club and we are not in it, Well they can keep their blood curdling and macabre pastimes.  Her brain has probably been washed by MK Ultra.  If that is the case, it does not even belong to her.

              No, but the rich elite and eccentric crazies are all to quick to latch on to someone as bizarre as her.  The more wacky she is the more they flock to her.  They worship at her feet, like she is their high priestess. I believe she may have been created by the CIA to draw them in like flies to honey.  Many MK Ultra Hollywood Robots are gushing over her as well.

            Don't you get it? This is how power works. You claim some supernatural, superhuman power/knowledge/lineage etc. etc., like, for example, having a brain that shoots laser-beams, and lo and behold! Before you know it, sycophants crawl out of the woodwork, longing to be in your presence, cherishing your every word and obediently waiting in subjugation for your commands.
           </p>
           <p>
            The power-trick is mindbogglingly simple. All you need is a narcissistic conviction that you really are the superhuman you project yourself to be, and your minions will automatically appear. Anyone who even had to deal with a true narcissist will understand this phenomenon, and will have pulled the hairs out of his head in rage and staggering disbelief at how an entire entourage of disciples will come to the narcissist's defense, in complete denial of any ratio or truth.
           </p>
           <p>
            The speed at which a considerable portion of the human race is able to completely hand over its brain, intellect, mind, ego, body, fate, faith and money to a posing alpha-monkey, is probably one of the most problematic aspects of life on this planet.

             well-said.  it is the narcissistic-derived delusional believe and proclamation that you are special, in order to garner narcissistic supply in the form of fans and worshipers, so that you can believe you are superhuman.  i see the same exact thing in these pop-stars who sell out to the illuminati... beyonce, gaga, perry, etc.

             Wow, you said it and the world is becoming full of narcissists especially through "new age crap".  A lot of this began at the turn of the last century with Mdme Blavatsky and her circus of occultists.
            </p>
            <p>
             Being a student of meditation, yoga and a couple of cults for many years, I am beginning to see it all in a whole different way.  (No offense to the yoga/meditation people, do what you want).  Everything is about bliss, letting everything be as it is, love, light and that bullshit, so that you can appear to be special, compassionate and loving and yet eternally ignorant of subtle evil behind it.
            </p>
            <p>
             After reading about Crestone, CO (lots and lots of spirituals centers there), Agenda 21 and the vultures that go there I am totally suspicious of all of it now.

             "they see the Baca, which they call ‘The Valley of the Refuge of World Truths,’ as the paradigm for the entire planet and say that the fate of the earth is at stake.  Apparently, the Kissingers, the Rockefellers, the McNamaras, the Rothschilds, and other Establishment New World Order elites all agree as well, for they do their pilgrimage to the Baca- where politics and the occult- the New World Order and the New Age- all merge…..
            </p>
            <p>
             Baca Grande also appears to be a magnet for military attention…. And reputedly is an active site for observing both UFO’s and spiritual manifestations."

             On both sides, there are too many people who believe in that supernatural stuff THEY want to make us believe in.
Many people really think that those people really get supernatural powers by sacrificing children or drinking blood, it scares me.

             And I say this as a person who isn't even denying the existence of anything "paranormal".
I just know, that mental illness' are real as well and this is what we are dealing with here.

             There is a good documentary about this on Netflix called Kumare.
            </p>
            <p>
             The guy fakes being a yogi and gets all these followers that hang on his every word. He is even telling them in classes that he isn't what they think and that they have what they need to be happy, etc. They don't even hear him saying it because they are so bought in.

                Oh fuck, I wish I hadn't googled that. Great, these fucks atop the pyramid are in a real win-win situation here; either the existing system of trafficking, harvesting, prostitution, blackmail and control/profit continues to their enrichment or they tank the public's faith in the institutions of state upon discovery so badly that it just pushes us closer to one world government. These Hegelian fucks think they're brilliant. The reason it provokes so much professional trolling is because shitheads like Alefantis, Brock, and Podesta know that they're the patsies whose head will fill guillotines if the public ever clues in.
