<p>So the question begs to ask, why is James ( \'elephant\', I  like children ) not his real name the poster boy and \'comet pizza\'? Why the distraction, and why is Andy Kline and non-starter to mention? Only Scientology (CIA) has his many bots &amp; shills to change the subject.</p>
<p>I suspect that not only is andrew kline an FBI fudge packer and 9th degree masonic illuminati fuck-boy since birth, but he is also a scientologist or mormon, for only they protect their own with this kind of attention deficit.</p>
<p>So in summary James is a plant, its not his real name, an he\'s not the the #48 most powerful fudge-packer in DC. James is a fall-boy. All the photo\'s from instagram were all setup, to keep people away from besta-pizza,</p>
<p>Here\'s what we know, besta-pizza is/was for fucking/killing/eating little boys, but comet-ping pong is for fucking little girls.</p>
<p>Note also that JAMES is not your typical queer, he doesn\'t look nor act queer, in his interview he alluded that chidldren of question were his, only goats would know the truth.</p>
<p>The real guys that fuck little boys in the ARSE look more like gay-edgar-hoover or like Andrew Kline, they\'re your normal Right-Wing fascist who has the crop hair, ... but really is a sodomist, and note they are not gay, they are simply people who get their rocks off of killing week ppl, another words they are bullys that cannot fight real men, and prefer to kill/rape baby boys. Welcome to the world of the FBI/CIA.</p>
<p>Note also say Falluaja and Iraq, one of the reasons that 4 black water guys got hung up on the bridge and burnt to death is US-MIL ( blackwater/cia) was going door-to-door and crushing testical of the first born of every home in order to get info. Again this is CIA/FBI normal shit, they are obsesssed with crushing/eating infant testicals.</p>
<p>All this goes back to Besta-Pizza, with the logo that says &quot;I fuck baby boys\', and note they were first to pull their logo, and they\'re the only ones covering for the owner, andrew kline.</p>',

            It's obvious why, they're all part of it.  We need to focus our efforts on finding solid and more circumstantial evidence to bring the case home to the normies.

              I am not a mod.  I'm not asking you to trust me, but I am asking people to look at the actual evidence and back up their claims.  I'm not hell-bent on anything but accuracy.

             pizzathrowaway is making the "we mistook him" case which is exactly what the shills are pushing.  Andrew J. Kline, owner of Bestas Pizza, is the same Andrew J. Kline that works at the DoJ in the human trafficking unit.

              Andrew Kline (who went to William &amp; Mary) wasn't ever the owner of Besta Pizza (not Bestas), he just represented them as a lawyer.  Unless you have evidence otherwise?
             </p>

              Andrew Kline (who went to Harvard) hasn't worked at the DOJ since 2009.  He now works at the FCC.
