<p>My thinking here is that Podesta/ Comet and company ordered this shooting from a crisis actor, which seems clear. Obviously they need someone good with weapons, someone who understands security and protecting the state, and it makes sense that it\'s someone who is involved in child filming or something they can be blackmailed with, forcing them to do this because they film child porn or other.</p>
<p>Questions I have are, if all this is listed online, but is still not generally well known by the public, I want to know why is it online to begin with. </p>
<p>IS THIS A COMPLETELY FAKE ORGANIZATION?
WHY CAN\'T I FIND ANY EVIDENCE OF THIS ORGANIZATION, AT ALL?
WHY CAN\'T I FIND ANY EVIDENCE OF EDGAR MADISON\'S FATHER\'S INVOLVEMENT IN THESE ORGANIZATIONS,  EVEN THOUGH HE HAS ALL THESE CREDENTIALS?</p>
<p>Is protect a child a front, or a completely made up non existing place? What is the connection with &quot;Forever Young Productions&quot;?
Seems like we haven\'t found out more about this...I\'m trying only just to confirm this protect a child even existed. can\'t find even one mention other than on pizzagate related...<a href="http://www.harrywelchjr.com/">Harry Walsh Page</a></p>',

            Just wanted to add this about the Little Coffin in Philly.  In Huff Post they wrote: “The medical examiner investigator at the scene confirmed that the contents of the casket were indeed embalmed internal organs,” Philadelphia police said in a statement to HuffPost.  I am keeping on this and just thought people might want to know as news comes out about the Little Babe. That is the latest as of noon today. This is all so sad.

             The 990-PF means that it's a private foundation, we will not find any tax information for this.

            <blockquote>
             <p>
              A nonoperating private foundation is a private foundation that isn't a private operating foundation. These often are referred to as “grant-making foundations.”

                Keep jackasses like us (and if he was legit protecting children pedos) from gathering the information and threatening his family.  It's a very common issue.  I was actually at the small business office of my county today and the guy was talking about other clients of his who are rather afraid of the situation.

                 That's a potentially good theory, especially since the actvities for the dog rescue are listed as prevention of cruelty to children.  However, it's a little odd that the address given for the dog rescue tracks to the office of Roberson CPA, an accounting firm:
                 <a href="http://robersoncpas.com/contact-us.html">
                  http://robersoncpas.com/contact-us.html
                 </a>
                 and the dog rescue's registered agent, George Fletcher, does not appear to be associated with Roberson, which shows all of its staff on its website.

            Excellent question.  Could easily be a faked organization intended to lend credence to the supposed motivation for the shooting--to protect children.

            "Forever Young Productions" was incorporated as a LLC in the 1950s.  The research is here on Voat.  The date would indicate it was Harry Welch Sr. who founded the company.
           </p>
           <p>
            There was a Welch Jr. who was the same age, same middle initial, who did 10 years hard time in OH, I believe, for a serious pedo crime.
           </p>
           <p>
            Sounds like some debts were collected.

             Now THAT is very interesting. I have gone onto Welch father's facebook page and his friends seem like Trump supporters so was wondering how they would be in a position to work for them, but the pedo thing is always blackmail related...

            have you tried wayback archives? I don't know how that works but anything that may have been online was probably scrubbed. The North Carolina Sec Of State dept might have incorporation papers for businesses and charities, I'd start looking there.

             Yeah that's super info I always forget about business incorporation, etc. I wonder if it's because he's so old that they didn't have online records when he held that position, if it was real...

              They would have to keep old records I think, but it might require going there if NC is not online. I would call them in the morning and see if you can get or how to get info that is older. They may ask you to submit  their state version of  FOIA.

               YOU- You should look into Harry Welch Jr's criminal record if you want the answer.

              </p>
              <p>
               YOU - What does that mean?
