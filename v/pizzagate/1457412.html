<p>Anyway, it made me think - where are kids that have been abducted taken? Is my nightmare a possible scenario? Are there towns or villages that operate externally like they are normal but internally are grooming students/children for pedophiles? I don\'t know if this is something that\'s been considered. Maybe my nightmare was just random and fueled by my lurking, or maybe it\'s a clue. I don\'t know. What\'re your thoughts?</p>
