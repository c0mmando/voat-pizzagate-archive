            Because directly exposing the material directs the attention of those who have already suppressed the information to begin a new round of suppression, but exposing the methods of getting past suppression challenges the forces of suppression to find new methods.

            You must be a bot because you are so illogical.  If pizzagate research is a stupid and pointless as you have said hundreds of times, who are we going to tip off?  What's to infiltrate?   No use talking to me, we are different worlds.  Good evening.

            I just think everyone should devote their energy to the pursuit they think is most useful, because I consider anyone who tries to deem themselves a leader figure and direct energy to be a plant. That's why Occupy was doomed from the start. They had leaders and did what the leaders said they should do.

            It is important to be accurate so as not to give excuses to the debunkers. For instance, the jimmycomet pictures were picked through and we only saw one or two pictures of the basement digging. There were other pictures related to the basement work and it turns out that it was not repairs to the pizza "parlor" but repairs to a house. This link has some of those pictures, although it also seems to be an incomplete collection.

            Or a sociopath.

            Not really familiar with both psychopath/sociopath, but can't they both function somewhat normally, until something triggers their true nature. It's a small portion of population, but most likely those people will seek power, and will do anything to gain it. More normal people might seek power and money, but will stop at a point where they are comfortable with their income etc, and the fact that their children will be better off.

            Pizzagate found there was enough concerning evidence to warrant an investigation.  I don't think most consider it hardcore proof.  Because Chief Newsham is a friend of comet, there will not be a local investigation.

             The burden of proof for probably cause to warrant an investigation is actually quite high.
            </p>
            <p>
             You would have to prove the person has committed a crime, or that CPP was the scene of a crime to search it. And to prove that, you have to have evidence of a victim and a crime otherwise it's against the 4th amendment.
            </p>
            <p>
             I haven't seen any verified victims, only children in photos people think are creepy and 'pedo-like'. Circumstantial at best.

              This is a great comment and will probably get buried.  You are correct and I am glad for the fourth amendment and would like it to be respected even for Comet Ping Pong.  It would be legal and possible for a police officer to go ask the owner if they could just look around to dispel the rumors, they could say yes, and the police could say they looked into it but found nothing.  But what happened was the police chief first said they had looked into it, then said they hadn't, then said they wouldn't.  Then he goes to the 'Stand with Comet' event.

It's exactly the same thing, maybe even a stronger example because there are actually 16 years of hard facts, scientific research, and government denial, disinformation and misinformation.

             The gov denial of the truth of 911 may be related to the issue of LIABILITY, and it would bankrupt our country. Among the thousand killed were foreign citizens. Also, there are many insurance policies that will not pay for "acts of war." If it is designated as a "crime" rather than an "act of war" then insurance companies must pay out to everyone, which could bankrupt the insurance companies. The insurance companies then, would have to investigate before paying.

            Who watches MSM or reads their crap?  That's the real question.
           </p>
           <p>
            Not a fan of Twitter, really -- but from what I'm seeing coming out of there re Pizzagate and other relevant stuff, I think I'll have to join in.
(I'm registered/just not active for a long time.)

           <p>
            Discouraged?  Keep in mind what former Detective Jim Rothstein is saying to Prof. Jim Fetzer in this interview -- i.e., that over the last 50 years there have been THREE investigations in NYC (they also can go international) which were all stopped once they got to the names of the higher up's.  One of those investigations reached the level of the State level where hearings were held.
Rothstein also related that "the book" of names was also turned over to Larry O'Brien, Chair/DNC at the Watergate which likely was one of the major reasons for the break-ins.

           <blockquote>
            <p>
             Here is what is happening. 17 days before Obama left office he made a change in the way this information is disclosed taking it from the NSA and spreading out through 16 other agencies which festered this whole leaking situation. No One in the media is talking about this. This is what took down Michael Flynn and news media assisted. We are really being run by the Intelligence Agencies now under Obama's Shadow Govt. :evil:
            </p>
           </blockquote>
           <p>
            Idea is the info that caused Flynn to fall came from one of those newly allowed to get the NSA cache.
And they might have done the same thing in regard to Sessions and Russia?
           </p>
           <p>
            It's important to those of us who are hoping that Sessions will act on pizzagate -- or at least keep busting pedophile rings.

            I am glad others see the evil.  It is terrifying to behold it.  What a sin they told us to accept and get along beside the evil, unspeakable things.  8Chan 2 months ago wasn't for the naive.  Mexican torture vids, real CP.  all of it raw.  George Webb, VOAT too.  4Chan.  Unforgivable acts.  You Tube.  We need help.  We need faith that there is a difference between right and wrong, complacency and caring.  Keeping an open mind also.

            Yet another reason why the push away from the 'pizzagate' label would be an important step forward. As much as I want to see that sack of shit Alefantis swinging by his neck, we need to remove the focus away from CPP, and therefore make (((their))) flimsy arguments regarding that shithole a mute point. As we all know, there's a much bigger picture that needs to be addressed here, so while we're still in the redpilling stage of the operation I would encourage everyone to start using the pedogate tag as a more useful alternative. Curse those motherfuckers for ruining the good name of pizza.

             Pizzagate is bigger than just pedo crimes. That is why Pizzagate is important. No one wants to look into Pedogate. They will run in the other direction. Everyone knows what Pizza is, everyone eats pizza, and everyone wants to find out what Pizzagate is. The problem is that both the corrupt network and the gullible public allowed the Fake News to narrow the scope of Pizzagate to create false victims and a false flag event. Pizzagate is much bigger than that, and represents the entire system of Global Criminal Corruption.
            </p>
            <p>
             This is why we need to shift the focus of Pizzagate to Racine, Wisconsin. If everyone finds out that the Real Pizzagate is in Paul Ryan's home district, they will be shocked when they find out the real truth behind Pizzagate and Global Criminal Corruption. This is not a joke, this is the best strategy to fix the entire world and expose the real truth. Unless of course no one cares about that.

              I see what you're saying there.  Here's the thing about Racine though, I have seen a lot of individual comments about Racine but I haven't seen any threads regarding it in depth really.  Is it something that's not being talked about because of ignorance or is it because it's disinformation?

             I have noticed that Alex Jones, oftentimes, will say Pizzagate/Pedogate.  He uses both, and I honestly prefer Pedogate anyway.  It keeps from tainting the pizza name, and still gets the point across.

               I think having the word pizza in the name actually generates more interest to the cause. Pedo is easy for people to figure out and then they have no questions or just don't want to go there. Someone asked me "what is Pizzagate?" And I was able to explain.

               I agree. I don't believe in all that gematria BS, but the satanists do.  Guess what "pizzagate" equals in gematria?  If you said 666 then you've been paying attention.

               Changing pizzagate to pedogate is a yuge FU.

               Right.  Like we don't know it's a stupid name anyway, let's be real.  Pizzagate should have never stuck in the first place.  But I digress, I think a consensus for like a broad name change could be helpful to the movement.  Anyone from pizzagate will see "pedogate" and recognize the movement anyway.

             The pictures of digging in a basement were part of a series of pictures. The other pics showed that it was at a house. But thank you for the comparative article where alefantis said he stored canned tomatoes in the basement.

             No. There are a lot of good reasons why "no", but I'm not going to get into that.

             If someone wants to post on reddit they can, but an organized effort would be pointless. The well is poisoned. Most of the commenters there are probably fake accounts, arguing with a wall is a waste of energy.

             Yeah, I can't imagine anything on reddit isn't astroturfed to fuck. It's so obviously painted over that it surprises me people think most of the comments are organic.

              I remember just a few months ago, around when pizzagate blew up, reddit's front page consisted of posts that were upvoated maybe in the 2-3 thousand range. Almost overnight front page posts had upvoats in the 10,000-30,000 range. This made no sense to me, then i remembered how easily it is to astroturf these subs to smithereens. The science sub is one huge echo chamber for NASA hoaxes.

              Only partially. Whenever Shareblue decides to raid it, and complain about why they aren't discussing "Trump as a Russian spy"-angle.

            It's like Bill Cooper said.  If you tell someone your name and they reply, "no it isn't," you have been "debunked."  At least they can say you have been debunked.  The facts remain.  All the proof says it is true and the only "proof" they have is saying "no it isn't."  Just continue the deluge of proof.  Facts wash away denial.

              And Bill exposed Alex Jones as a sham way back at Y2K. He knew about the false flags going on in the 90's and tried to warn us when the intranet was still new to us. Before there was a truth movement, Bill warned us about the Masons and every one of their agendas, the evil of the CIA and FBI, he predicted 9/11 a couple months before it happened and knew who they would blame it on, and he knew why they were doing it. The grandfather of the Truth movement before people were even looking for the truth. Of course they killed him asap at his own home. We did nothing and here we stand, our world on lock down with the scum of the earth running roghshod over humanity. RIP Bill Cooper.

            I wonder how many here really "get" the breadth and depth of what we're up against.
           </p>
           <p>
            The focus is on all these individual players; nothing wrong with that.  It also helps to understand individual mindsets in order to predict their behaviors.  But what we're seeing in PG is only the TIP of the iceberg.
           </p>
           <p>
            The real battle is against SYSTEMS and CULTURES.  We are in a CULTURAL WAR and have been -- whether you realize it or not -- for milllenia.  We are talking all the way back to the origins of man.  That is why this is as pervasive as it is and has gone on for as long as it has.  The only way to combat the problem is to fight it on THAT scale.  That, coupled with the fact that the ENEMY IS IN CONTROL, unfortunately, is precisely why I question if it will get done.

            Despite their claims to the contrary, most people DO NOT want to hear the truth (just like the line in the movie).  I could spend a long time laying out the truth in a post -- acquired from living my life and also the fruits of 11 years of research -- and within seconds I would get attacked and downvoated -- maybe even banned.  (It has happened here and on other forums.)  Since it conflicts with the preconceived notions (read: lies) that we have all been taught in "school" and reinforced in the fakestream media, nobody would listen.  They don't want to hear it because it's not pleasant AND it's not politically correct.  Plus they would have to spend TIME and EFFORT doing research on their own to confirm or refute the info I just spoonfed them, and they're too lazy to do even that.  It's much easier just to blow something off and hurl ad hominems at the messenger.

             you are 100% right.  this is a war good vs. evil, culture vs. culture.  they want life to not matter at all and rape and murder children and groom young boys to be gay.  it's "pizza culture" vs. traditional morals culture which I consider life affirming.

             Cultural war...?
            </p>
            <p>
             It's a species war. 
People just don't want to face up to it.
I didn't watch that podesta video with that screaming child, but I'm sure some of the "truther" community know what was in that room that terrified that child so much. 
So many Satanists spend their lives trying to discredit David Icke but what they don't know is that what Icke talks about  is
embedded in our genetic memories...being terrifien by reptiles or dragons, or whatever people call them.
            </p>
            <p>
             Some already know what Icke is talking about before they ever heard of the guy.
            </p>
            <p>
             There is a book called "Tall Man walking" (think I got that right) about something that happen to one of the aborignes in Austrailia. 
It's plain as day what that author was trying to get across although, as usual, he tries to discredit or play down what happened at the same time as he's telling the story.
            </p>
            <p>
             But all you have to do is read between the lines to know what happened.
            </p>
            <p>
             Sure there are psychopaths among us, but even they don't rape 5 years to death and bite infants to death while they are still alive.
            </p>
            <p>
             The monsters among us, do it every weekend,. It's a party to them.
Not to mention the pointless wars and the deliberate poisoning of the earth.
            </p>
            <p>
             Who among our species, does this kind of stuff; bomb people in the day, then go out dancing and yucking it up at night?
            </p>
            <p>
             Hiding your face it the sand still leaves your ass exposed.
And that's what they really want in the first place.
            </p>

             It's all about mockery, rape and vengeance on us for whatever reason.
            </p>
            <p>
             And I think the reason is, because some "gods"  and ancient slavemasters, were defeated and deprived of their "divine rights" to murder, rape, enslave and torture with impunity by our Ancestors.
They have to do it on the download now because of fear of us, and it enrages them.
But it seems they think they are ready to come out in the open again because all these videos are not released because they can't stop them, or hide what they do.
They rub it in our face because they think they can handle us with anything we try to do.
Nothing more vengeful and demented that a top dog who is defeated by his lesser.

              Despite their claims to the contrary, most people DO NOT want to hear the truth (just like the line in the movie). I could spend a long time laying out the truth in a post -- acquired from living my life and also the fruits of 11 years of research -- and within seconds I would get attacked and downvoated -- maybe even banned. (It has happened here and on other forums.) Since it conflicts with the preconceived notions (read: lies) that we have all been taught in "school" and reinforced in the fakestream media, nobody would listen. They don't want to hear it because it's not pleasant AND it's not politically correct. Plus they would have to spend TIME and EFFORT doing research on their own to confirm or refute the info I just spoonfed them, and they're too lazy to do even that. It's much easier just to blow something off and hurl ad hominems at the messenger.&gt;

             Let's stop the "PC" propaganda - new HATE speech regulations are about hate speech which seriously effects females -- even on our city streets with males calling and shouting to women and name calling.  We've even see it go so far as full on physical attacks by male gangs on females.  This is what Elite patriarchy wants to keep males and females divided -- a re-energized full scale patriarchal war on women.
            </p>
            <p>
             BUT, beyond that -- give your truth-telling a chance here and let's see where it goes.
Since we really don't know anything officially about the "origins of man" -- i.e., whether we are hybrids or not - we can't say what was happening 375,000 years or more ago.  We don't know who our cousins or our mothers may be in the universe.  But looking for the roots of violence in humankind may go further back than what we consider higher-up's today, even Royalty.  Did violence begin in the Garden of Eden/Lab where animal-eating seems to have been introduced?  Recall that Eve stands forever holding the Apple which is without doubt a message.  And let's not forget the Twilight Zone's "To Serve Humankind" ... punch line:  A cookbook.

             Certainly, violence and Satanic Ritual come to us from organized patriarchal religions which invented Satan, the Devil - Heaven and Hell.  That's the source of it that we're still aware of today.  And there is still some information coming through today on those SRA's and the Vatican.  Here's a search page on it -

              "Certainly, violence and Satanic Ritual come to us from organized patriarchal religions which invented Satan, the Devil - Heaven and Hell."  This is asinine. Violence originates in nature, precedes humankind or civilization and is a consequence of competition over resources. Read Guns, Germs &amp; Steel.

               The Old Religions of the world had NO Satan, and NO Devil -- NO Heaven and NO Hell.
              </p>
              <p>
               Because Satan, the Devil - Heaven &amp; Hell begin with organized patriarchal religions -- i.e., male-supremacist religions -- that's where Satanic Rituals begin
and they are reported to still be happening in the Vatican.

               These creations are based in the fears, insanity and paranoia of males --
              </p>
              <p>
               No -- we are not naturally violent.  If you look at any other species in Nature, you see nothing like what humans have done in 
destruction of all Nature, the planet::Global Warming, and of others of their species or in any general attack on all animal-life.
That kind of behavior is seen only among humans, where I would also note that the male half of the species is still conducting
a violent war on the other half -- women!  You do not see that anywhere else in Nature.
              </p>
              <p>
               You also see that within the Garden of Eden/Lab from which we seem to have arisen that there was a very serious disruption which
was based in the "Tree of Knowledge"/DNA -- and that seems to have been when humans were taught to eat animals.
Those bloody sacrifices seem to have gone on since that time, despite the very clear inner messages of the spirit to the contrary.
And despite -- if anyone is basing anything on the Bible -- the Biblical messages to "eat only what grows in the garden."
The conflicts and convoluted writings within the Bible are taken for granted as "corrections and editing" despite the original 
instructions NOT to change the writings.

                Hey, thanks for the thoughtful reply! I don't really mean to suggest that I subscribe to some Thomas Hobbes' view of nature, but that humans don't have a monopoly on violence, nor does organized religion, patriarchal or otherwise. Pre-monotheistic religion civilizations practiced violence, often ritualized, and, as I stated in my post, generally spawned by competition for resources. And in so, you're right about the religion aspect, however, I think you're wrong about the patriarchy being the precursor to it. The oldest occupation is by no means prostitution, it's shamanism and it's the origin of inequality and hierarchy within society. Zinn talks about how within anthropolgy there are some tribes that are fierce, and there are some tribes that are peaceful; he's right, but the determinant of those features is the abundance or scarcity of resources. I don't even believe it's his contention that patriarchy is the distinction, merely that power corrupts. Furthermore, I believe that what types of gods we worshiped was determined by the availability of food, and how we came by it.

                <p>
                 Hi Pokes --
                </p>
                <p>
                 Yes, true, the original violent attack on females is said to have come from behind Turkey when they experienced a drought/famine 
in that area, leading to an attack on females in the valley. That's allegedly how the world got turned upside down to begin with.
Women had by then developed systems of tending plants for food.  But males seem to have a natural fear of females, as well.
                </p>
                <p>
                 Humans are more violent than the balance of the animal world/Kingdom -- that was what I was trying to point out to you.
Humans are at war with their better half -- females.  That's more than 50% of human existence.  Every day you will read 
stories in our newspapers of females killed by their husbands, ex-husbands, boyfriends, ex-boyfriends, on and on.
Nor do animals generally fight within groups to the death as humans do.
                </p>
                <p>
                 Organized patriarchal religion - male-supremacist religion - set new precedents for violence within the Inquisition.  It would take you 
a fairly long time to even get through the catalogue of tools and means used for torture.  Satan/Devil were invented by these religions
which has done great psychological harm to humanity, but beyond that it gave rise to Satanic Ritual Abuse within the Vatican and
various RCC cults around the world.  Some nuns still today are testifying to such rituals still taking place in the Vatican basement.
We also see that these SRA's are also being used within pedophile rings.
                </p>
                <p>
                 The Old World Religion had NO Satan, NO Devil and No Heaven and NO Hell -- they were strictly based in Nature.
                </p>
                <p>
                 The Old Testament was written to cement patriarchy.  It also created a very violent "god" concept which was responded to in the 
New Testament by "Jesus" who stood against patriarchy, against the "money lenders" and many other of its teachings.
                 <br/>
                 Many of its teachings are convoluted and contradictory because of future edits, despite the caution to not change the writings.
Notably, many writings by females were removed.  Including the fact that "Mary's" history which was matriarchal was removed 
from her and assigned to "Jesus."
                </p>
                <p>
                 We've also had many myths of violence among other people -- including cannibalism -- but upon further investigation we see that 
"whites" one way or another introduced either the conditions or the rituals.  Or -- it was simply myth.
                </p>
                <p>
                 If you check even our own Constitution you will find that the Founders actually established an Elite Patriarchy.
They endowed it with land grants and immense control and influence over our people's government,
including our nation's wealth and natural resources.  This was all done while our Founders proclaimed "All are equal"
but gave only these male property owners the right to vote.
                </p>
                <p>
                 Our Founders also protected the system of Slavery for Elites/wealthy, even down to the Runaway Slave Act and into another 100 
years of Segregation.  That actually guaranteed the Civil War which divided the American public and weakened the population and
that weakness of division continues to echo over our nation still today.  That in itself was an important gain for Elites in weakening
the nation, but not mentioned in our elementary schools.
                </p>
                <p>
                 How can it be that so many of us were taught to honor and esteem this document in our schools?
None of our adult teachers happened to notice these conflicts?
                </p>
                <p>
                 I don't know how you are interpreting Shamanism:  "Magic" has always been used to fool the people, especially claiming ties and
relationships with more powerful forces.
                </p>
                <p>
                 There is also the studied art of healing which also comes from knowledge of the natural world and plants which are our drugs.
All of our drugs are based in natural plants which are then manipulated for profit.
Most of the earliest healers were females who studied plants and remedies ...
Nature is also pro-choice as she provided plants which enable females to control fertility or to end it, to prevent pregnancies, to 
interrupt conception/abortion.  At the time of the Female Holocaust (Witch Hunts) these plants were destroyed by patriarchy.
                </p>
                <p>
                 If you look at patriarchy more closely you see that it is first a war on Nature.  Then a war on women.  These are their primary enemies.
As Mary Shelly told it in "Frankenstein" males are at war with nature for denying them the power to produce life.
But it is also obviously based in their fear and paranoia of nature and animal-life and their need to control everything around them.
                </p>
                <p>
                 I think what Zinn is saying about non-violent revolution is extremely important to us today as we try to move forward against the 
immense corruption of our governments all over the world -- control put in place via violence.

eternally because she understood that she was created in the same way as Adam and was his equal.  It's almost impossible to find the true story of Lilith.

                  Re: Shamanism, once someone could divine the natural universe and cosmos, explaining previously mystifying phenomena through the use of hallucinagens, they established themselves as a fundamental person of significance and importance within their tribe. Do you think it's possible a collection plate precedes christianity? I imagine that was origin of heirarchy, if only in that one person became distinct and exalted. Whether or not it was the science of its time aside, once a shaman was able to communicate with the gods, they became someone worth ingratiating oneself to; I imagine private property, beyond that which people earned through objective contribution and not merely deceit or salesmanship, emerged shortly thereafter. Admittedly, this is just my own theory, but there is no objective verifiable prehistory, so I base it on my studying anthropology and my understanding of human nature and contemporary history.

                   Hi Pokes --
Think I've gotten necessary links added to the reply now --
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   as for this reply, I have to move on for a while, but ....
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   IF we are hybrids, then there are aliens involved -- "made in their own image" -- and some say we are
cousins to Nordics.  Draco-Reptilians which seem to control this planet and a few others and are "aggressive" -- 
and I'd refer you back to the old Twilight Zone broadcasting of "To Serve Mankind" -- it was a cookbook!
That may be the worst of it and the power behind the throne.  We don't, of course, know, but Vatican may know.  :)
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   Was reading yesterday that marijuana works against mind control -- under MKULTRA, victims say that was the 
only "drug" prevented from being used on or by victims.  Nature seems to love Marijuana and spreads it everywhere!
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   It seems that IF aliens came to earth 375,000 or more years ago, that they came as "Royals" -- higher ups over tribes.
Sumerians, for one.  Lots of rumors about British Royals as Draco-Reptilians.  :)

                  <p>
                   I think Christianity was involved in a great deal of theft -- Columbus saw it as his primary duty to spread "Christianity" here.
Native Americans say:
                   <br/>
                   "When they came we had the land and they had the book.  When they left, we had the book and they had the land."
Remember, Christianity invented Capitalism when Feudalism was no longer sufficient to run their Papal States.
This is also where fascism rises in Northern Italy.

                   In all of the "acquisitions" by US government of land - Hawaii, etal -- Christianity was the first tool introduced.
Same here on this continent - religion used as tool of conquest.

                   Collection plate?  Well, did mid-wives receive more than gratitude for a safe birth, or a healing remedy.  Don't know.
But, they were big on spreading knowledge, unlike what we see within patriarchy where knowledge is held secret.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   Even male doctors in the not so distant past worked on gratitude -- and maybe a chicken or a few eggs.
It was very important left over custom in communities, evidence of that being where we used to be in truth and trust
for healers.

                   Private property concept allowed them to force at least one drunken Native American into signing their alleged property over
to invaders.  Also "literacy" -- documents, deeds, legal writings when the Natives could not read.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   Betty Friedan was able to see through what Sigmund Freud had done in the Oedipus Complex ... they say ...
                   <strong>
                    because
she was not exposed to the regimen of professional psychiatry.
                   </strong>
                   Freud actually based his talking therapy on hypnotism
but had to remove that part of it because too many of his students were unable to hypnotize patients.
But we see that Freud himself was likely a child molester and that he created a truly outrageous theory which blamed 
infants and toddlers and young children for the sexual abuse of adult males in their families.  This was also a total
betrayal of what his young patients had confided in him in regard to sexual abuse by fathers, grandfathers, uncles,
cousins and male friends of the family.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   In other words, a lot of our history is based in white male propaganda.

                   Even more so today we see this effect of the "regimen" of the medical arts effects on the free-thinking of medical professionals,
who are also too often blinded by Big Pharma's gifts -- trips, etal.  There is only personal safety in following the regimen"
It's dangerous for them to think outside the lines.

                    Thanks for the reply. Sounds very David Icke and Prometheus, or ancient aliens to me but, admittedly, I've not researched much on the why people believe this. I do however believe that there is a tremendous amount of alternative archeology n anthropology which is conducted exclusively by charlatans. That said, I'm inclined to believe patriarchy is awful, but unfortunately we don't have a double blind to see what sort of inequality might have emerged under industrialized matriarchy; perhaps it'd have been relatively benign, perhaps it'd have been less opaque, or contained less consolidation of power. Again, no way to know for sure but am not ruling out that man and testosterone are to possibly blame for the woes of the world. But it's such an easy answer, i'm inclined to believe it's simply more nuanced than that, which is not to say that you're not correct to an extent.

                    Re: doctors working on an altruistic basis just look at Cuba; they have free post-secondary education and in their society a doctor makes less than a bartender or ditch digger. The rationale for this is simple: you want to study instead of working for 8years, graduate and work in an air conditioned office, get to stay clean and wear a suit, never exert yourself, receive the gratitude of your patients all day long AND you want to be wealthy? they consider that the height of greed, and guess what, they have more doctors per capita than anywhere else in the world.

                    Re: The new world and colonization; dominion over this earth as a principle of the bible strikes me as more relevant. While I appreciate that the natives didn't have private property, and in so they were at a conceptual loss when it came to defending themselves vs exploitation, that distinction didn't prevent the colonization of less materialistically innocent cultures.

                    A lot of our history IS based on white male propaganda. But again, I'm inclined to believe that whomever acquires power will likely resort to reprehensible acts in order to maintain it, that it's human nature, not determined by the presence of one hormone over others, although perhaps exacerbated by it.

                    I'm not sure I see the effects of the regimen being based in patriarchy, but rather in the love of money, of greed and the nature of ambition and human corruptibility.

                     And, true, I do see Ancient Aliens as a plus for the public, getting them to think.
Many reasons for keeping an open mind on this subject -- Post WWII flyovers of UFO's over Capitol -- Roswell -- and, of course, the many witnesses from inside government/military and outside who have tried to bring forth information.
Disclosure is also an interesting project.
But you seem to have made up your mind to close it.  :)
Are you noticing that you're labeling "alternative archeology and anthropology" as fake news by charlatans?
Rather the reality is that Elites have sought to control information on every subject from medicine to anthropology and many other subjects.  The very core of what we are fighting right now is secrecy.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     Also keep in mind from what we have seen of Big Pharma research, including vaccines, that many studies are tossed out when they don't agree with what they want reported.  That's why we've had the battle to make all research/tests reportable.

                     The remaining chapters in the book contain Barry’s interpretation of the magnitude of the information which Thompson has revealed and urges the country’s leaders to push for a congressional investigation of the ~100,000 pages of evidence that Thompson has handed over to Rep. Bill Posey’s office. One of Posey’s staffers described the documents as a “wildfire” that “could burn the CDC to its foundations.”
And here's some whistleblowing on vaccines which every parent should be aware of --

                     Any movement that rises on violence has to be closely looked at and thought about and that is how patriarchy rose and continues to hold control/power.  Again, that's what we're looking at in Pizzagate/Pedo-gate .... trafficking of humans by kidnapping, violence, abuse and kept going by corrupt officials.

                     Women have run a 50,000 year non-violent revolution because they understand that violence only breeds more violence.
But recall that it took one half of the species in order to about the oppression of females all over the world.
Nature gave women sole responsibility for bring forth human life and put her full confidence in women.
It is with the overthrowing of females and the murderous purges of females that males took control.
It is often called:  "The bird with one wing."
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     And we have seen the results of what has been delivered in Global Warming which has made the planet unfit for human life.
That's the evidence.  And, still not chastened in any way as to the violence and destruction they've brought forth, then continue on trying to deny that reality and have spent 70 years trying to hide what they've done.
                    </p>

                     US ranks 37th in the world in health care.  True, elites do get great health care, but not the general population.
And, Cuba not only ranks above the US in health care, they also send their doctors out into the world to help other nations.
If you're familiar at all with Michael Moore's documentaries, in his visit to France where they also have National Health care program, their doctors also make more modest salaries than what happens here -- maybe $200,000 annually -- and they obviously understand the difference between what they are doing and what is happening here.  Clear conscience is something to be valued.  Sounds like we agree on doctors/medical system and evils of  "Mankind's dominion over Nature."

                     What Freud says to many of us is that he greatly feared women.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     Anyone who has ever existed has gotten here through the body of a female.  What we do know about males is that they are the weaker sex.  More males die before the age of two, for one bit of evidence for this.  They also die earlier than women.
                     <br/>
                     Males seem to suffer paranoia more than women -- and they may have actually thought that women in child birth were killing them?  Over and again we see this paranoia and fear on display in males.
Females are the protectors of children, which is why pedophiles and patriarchy have always worked to destroy that protective influence -- from child labor to sexual abuse of children.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     In order to exercise their greed and to reach power, the tools/regimen of institutionalizing society are very clear ...
medicine is but one regimen, taking over our plants and destroying information about them and calling them "drugs" doesn't hide what the Rockefeller's did in order to control human knowledge.  This is quite contrary to what females did when they controlled medicine -- they shared the knowledge, informed their patients so they could understand what the remedies were.  Medicine was less invasive than we see today.  They didn't destroy plants to prevent others from also having knowledge of them.  Nor did they destroy the information about the plants -- patriarchy did.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     And I recall no period when females ran Holocausts -- patriarchy did.

                    <p>
                     And, again, we also have the evidence that MALES are our sexual abusers of children.  Even right wing women's groups agree with that evidence.  Heterosexual males are 100X more likely to sexually abuse a child than a homosexual male.
While we may consider that pedophiles really have no sexual orientation -- neither heterosexual, bi-sexual, or homosexual -- the majority of these males are heterosexual according to studies.
I've included that information many times here -- but if you want a link, let me know.

                     Note --
Coming back to "regimens" -- right now I'm aware that dentistry has been turned upside down by changing materials which are today less effective than prior materials.  Plastic fillings, for one, where today's dentists are told that they were ineffective.
Dentistry is also telling dentists over the last two decades or so that they needn't worry about trying to make their work last for decades -- just 7 years or so is sufficient.  Some of this info I've come by personally, but balance of it also comes from a Dentist (regular poster) reporting from attendance at one of their dental conventions about a decade ago.

             I can't upvote you right now but I understand and am aware. I don't go into those details with my personal network so I try to prep them in a way by having them think about and acknowledge God. Then the occult references in the emails also helps me in being clear that these guys undoubtedly are involved in it. No one - at top levels of government anyway - should be discussing it as a normal act, referencing terms socially or attending occult events. That is undeniable logic. So i'm hoping this will keep them from being in total shock and serves to sow more seeds of doubt in more people as i go along.

             This time may actually be different, though.  Even back when Tiberius was getting tiddled, there was a stigma attached to it.  Despite modern efforts by groups like the Pedophile Information Exchange (PIE) or the "virtuous pedophile" movement that Salon.com and others are trying to promote, it is hard to believe that child molestation can be successfully and openly introduced as part of the mainstream value system.  When the molestation turns into murder with ritualistic gobbledygook attached (Crowley/Thelema/OTO crap), it's very difficult to believe that a modern audience would approve.  History may move slowly, but it moves.

              Equineluvr suggested you forget religious books but I disagree if what he had in mind was the Bible. Unless you're a christian, please hear me out. Our world and the evil within it only makes sense through the lens of Scripture. You're going to encounter a lot of newfangled philosophies, concepts and beliefs that'll make your head spin.
              <em>
               Every last one of them are satanically inspired
              </em>
              . It's not unreasonable or ridiculous to think these conspiracies could be true because this is Satan's MO. Satan would be ineffective if he were to conduct his business blatantly in front of us. Knowing this, he uses subversion, deception, and secrecy to advance his agenda. At the bottom of the rabbit hole is Legion. A demonic military hellbent on claiming as many souls as they can for their king, Satan.

              <p>
               Then Jesus asked him, "What is your name?" "My name is Legion," he replied, "for we are many."
              </p>

               For our battle is not against flesh and blood, but against the rulers, against the authorities, against the world powers of this darkness, against the spiritual forces of evil in the heavens

              If you want to get to the core of it. forget "organizations" like Freemasonry, even the Vatican stuff.  YES they play a role.  But they are merely tools.  Forget religious books too.  That has its place, but you won't find what's needed there either.  Forget the alien crap too.
             </p>
             <p>
              I won't tell you specifically which books to read, but I will give you this big clue and hope that you take it to heart:  Go OUTSIDE the conspiracy theory genre.  The answers lie in ANTHROPOLOGY, and there are some clues in MEDICINE as well.  Look for the one or two scholars who have been blackballed and had their careers and lives DESTROYED.  They are the TRUTH tellers.  You will NEVER find the uncensored, complete truth in ANY "conspiracy" book.

                No, not Sitchin.  Sitchin is a fraud.  No scholar has ever translated those tablets and come up with what Sitchin has.  This has nothing to do with space and everything to do with what happened right here on earth, which is why they use the alien/outer space crap to get you looking in the wrong place.
               </p>
               <p>
                I mean REAL anthropologists.  As in, Ph.D. based out of a university.  Not in the U.S.  Published books for the general public.  Destroyed by academia.
               </p>
               <p>
                Nobody in particular for the medical part.  Just study basic anatomy and how it relates to paleoanthropology.  Look at recent discoveries.
               </p>
               <p>
                Then take a look at some ancient (the oldest) languages and try to match those with what you learned about ancient humans.  Then take a look at human migrational patterns.  Note that all this stuff can be cursory; you don't have to earn a degree in it.  And mainstream articles are fine.
               </p>
               <p>
                Do the above and figure out who the pariah anthropologist(s) is/are, and you've got the pieces of the puzzle to put together.  By then you should be hooked, and you'll be reading everything you can get your hands on.  Because all the observations you have made your entire life will suddenly all "click" together.  At least, that's how I hope it turns out for you.  That's what happened with me, and I wouldn't go back for anything.

                 I've heard of some theories like this along the lines of different human species evolving simultaneously but thinking very differently and preferring different paradigms. A little broad, but I'd be very interested in exploring it a bit further. My dad was a fan of Glen Keely who while seemingly off his rocker, had some interesting theories tying back to early times relating to anthropology. Would love if you could PM me the link, I tried to PM but don't have enough points whatever those are.

                 Firstly, having a Ph.D and a job at a university doesn't preclude the possibility of your being a crackpot, in fact, many are! Nor should you presume someone is brilliant because they have a doctorate; stupid people are statistically over-represented in academia just like everywhere else. Secondly, I've studied anthropology in university, it was my major until I transferred. I'm familiar with babylonian n sumerian n mesopotamians cultures and have studied anthropology of religion. I've read Guns, Germs &amp; Steel and I thought it was insightful. What specifically are you suggesting. We've been deceived supposedly, so and so is a fraud. Ok, who then, if you would be so kind, would you suggest someone begin with that might shed some light on this grand conspiracy you're referring to?

                  Wow, you have NO IDEA whom I'm referring to, haven't read anything that he's written, and you're already commenting upon him?!
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  I never stated nor implied that he was "brilliant."  I worship NOBODY, and I question EVERYTHING.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  His work was LEGIT, which is why they destroyed him.  It has been corroborated by cross-referencing with medicine AND the recent "discoveries" -- which HE initially made years ago; he is deceased now -- in paleoanthropology.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  You should go back and reread my posts because I'm not repeating myself.  Religion has NOTHING to with the the origins of man.

                   Again, you're acting coy like I haven't asked you outright for said gentleman's name. I promise you I will not read a wikipedia write up on him and prejudge his work. If you would be so kind, thank you!

                    Are you some dbag or a shill? I wrote nothing warranting a downvote.  But thanks! You're the one acting like you haven't contradicted yourself and invited the response you received.

                    "I mean REAL anthropologists. As in, Ph.D. based out of a university. Not in the U.S. Published books for the general public. Destroyed by academia." Lol, are you trying to be funny? Because if this solitary truth teller has been blackballed by academia, then why ought i defer to "REAL" anthropogists? You grasp that the vast consensus among academically employed anthropologists supports the established pardigm? How about you just say who people should read? Or are you insinuating that by merely dropping hisname your account would be banned? That's some interesting persecution. Just the mention of a name. You must have the key to it all in your hands, shame "they" won't let you share.

               "Freemasonry and the Vatican stuff" are stepping stones that lead to the big picture though. Searchers of the truth would still benefit by looking into them, because those subjects are going to lead to other questions which will lead to further searching.  That's where I am. I don't know the end of the story but I'm at the part now where I've realized we are the victims of a really long con.  Even the Bible seems to have been written with the intention of messing with our perceived reality.  But that doesn't mean that a higher power who cares about humanity doesn't exist, it just may not be the entity we've been bred and brainwashed to believe in. I'm not gonna try to push this on any disbelievers and debunkers. Maybe their simple minds can't handle this red pill. Seriously I'm starting to wish I picked the blue one.

                Yes, that's why I prefaced my response with, "If you want to get to the core of it."  If someone is not there yet, is not ready for it, or can't handle it then they should keep nibbling at what they can handle.

              Remarks that go over the heads of most are often remarks that go just high enough to be heard by those who most ought to hear them.  Fear not the fool, fear not the wise.

              EDIT: This person is no victim and no friend. This person is a fraud who stalks other users and falsely debunks true allegations without doing any research and demands to be spoon fed every bit of information in lieu of research, investigation, and critical thinking. See below where they are doing exactly what they describe above - they do NOT want to hear the truth, and 11 years of research has resulted in being incredibly ignorant and a complete shill who makes their decisions about truthfulness based on someone's ID on Voat. This person is exactly why Pizzagate will go nowhere without a better strategy.
             </p>
             <p>
              ORIGINAL: For those who have knowledge of these crimes or witnessed these crimes, it can be discouraging and dangerous to expose the truth, particularly on sites like Reddit that are controlled and compromised. Voat is not without its problems, but still offers some hope. The people involved are very powerful and hedge all sides of all cases. Don't give up. Don't ever give up.
             </p>
             <p>
              Also, in case you want to help, Racine, Wisconsin is the key to solving Pizzagate and Global Criminal Corruption. It sounds strange but it is true. We need to help each other. Instead of changing the name of Pizzagate to something else, we need to shift the story away from the basement of a pizza place to Main Street USA in Racine, Wisconsin.
             </p>
             <p>
              We need to put the spotlight on Paul Ryan's own district which is an epicenter for Pizzagate and Global Criminal Corruption. Racine is known for pizza in more than one way, and it connects the dots that could not be connected by other means. It would accomplish what the Franklin scandal in Omaha could not. What if everyone realized they could save the world by supporting something so simple and obvious? We can still help Johnny Gosch by doing the right thing this time around.

                Here are some videos that begin to show you some of the corruption in Racine. Also look up some old blogs called Racine Exposed and News the Journal Times Can't Use. Those cover some of what has been going on in Racine, but it goes much deeper than that. Am working on a more complete list of how it is all connected, but please start here if you want to see a glimpse into some parts of the corruption in Racine.

                  That is just one of a few other local sites with some information about the corruption in Racine. It is much deeper than that, but did you happen to watch any of the videos and look into any of the cases? Did you find out about the past mayor and the District Attorney whose job it was to investigate this? Did you learn about their current mayor and who made illegal contributions to his campaigns? Are you starting to see a pattern of corruption? It gets a lot bigger than pay to play racketeering and a few rigged development deals. Those are just for fun.

               You have posted that ad infinitum, littering practically every thread with this stuff.  And you STILL haven't supplied a single link -- despite numerous requests -- and you have also crawfished from this hyperbole on another thread.
              </p>
              <p>
               SO:

              <ul>
               <li>
                <p>
                 Make up your mind.  Is Racine, WI the "key to solving PG and global criminal corruption" or isn't it?  You can't have it both ways.

               <li>

                 Put up or shut up.  Give at least one supportive link to your position, whenever you decide what that is.

                Hello stalker. Don't believe it if you don't want to. Don't research it if you don't want to.

               <p>
                It is all true. But there are shills like you who get off on falsely debunking things you are clueless about. Do you need a link to know about Johnny Gosch or did you debunk that too and he is actually in Hawaii with the other winners from The Running Man?
               </p>

                Your moniker suggests you fuck horses, BTW. Stick to that and leave saving the world to the rest of us.

                 <p>
                  Great research! You are busting this wide open! People who actually ate pizza and spent $10,000. Call the FBI!
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  Try reading all of the posts, investigating it and then come back to dispute any of it.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  Until then you are a total shill, a stalker and a fraud.

                    Not sure about that one, but there are many of those types of blogs in Racine, and several that were taken down due to threats. Another Racine blog was called Racine Exposed and one was News the Journal Times Can't Use. You can find them with the wayback machine. There are a few others that all report of different cases, there was a documentary made about the RICO case called Pattern or Practice, and there is a new YouTube series called Talking Racine that covers some aspects of the corruption also.

                You realize this line of thinking is disastrous right?  Because then no matter how many people get arrested, they just didn't go high enough.  They could imprison 60% of DC and there would be people thinking "But maybe....those were just sacrificial lambs to protect (higher ups/bankers/NWO/Reptilians/Aliens/Rothschilds/etc)"

              So how many actual physical human beings have you saved then?  Because that's what I'm talking about.

             <p>
              Not on the internet by spreading awareness, but real people.  Until I see "EngelbertHumperdink saves a child from human trafficking in ____"  I'll consider your contribution ancillary to people who actually do the heavy lifting.

               No, I get it.  But my point is that we can't just sit back and rely on 'the professionals' when the problem is this huge.

               <p>
                Regardless of what you think you're doing right now in preventing human trafficking, until you physically rescue someone from a pimp or a sex ring, you ARE sitting back and relying on 'the professionals'.  They are the ones that are actually doing the work and that's what most people recognize.  They realize that most of what people do on here is virtue signaling vs organizations that put their morals into practice in the real world through action.

                 It's funny you mention that.  My father once rescued a girl from human trafficking.  Literally carried her out of a crack house to (at least temporary) safety.  And he was definitely not law enforcement.

              I am not sure that "professional organizations" and "government" are the same thing, but I see what you're saying.  I know that I am having some trouble with the pizzagate research and compilation mostly because the only ones we have on our side is each other.  And who is to say how many we have in our ranks?  If we wanted to finally storm the white house or something, how would that be organized?  A professional organization of a sort would be very helpful in this endeavor, with a wide enough reach you can make almost anything happen.  However, we then run into the issue of "well who the fuck are we supposed to ask?  CPS?  NCMEC?  CGI?  THORN?  MillionKids?" and that's where I kind of lose my spunk if I don't keep an eye on my attitude and the
              <em>
               goal
              </em>
              of this investigation.  And the goal of this investigation is to bring the truth to light and save the kids.  At least, for me, it is.

                Well yes. That's what I'm currently seeing in PizzagateAngela and Alex Jones and Cynthia McSomethinf (McKinney? McConnell?). Actively bringing the truth to light for their audience. I mean I do this thing where I don't feel like I'm doing enough even when I am. I as in just myself or I as in a collective in this case.

                    And I agree with this as well.  It's a catch 22 here.  Either we cause a commotion and it blows over or we don't cause a commotion and it blows over.  Again.  Like it has, apparently, countless times.
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    So that begs the question.  How would we form a group without being infiltrated by the shills?

                        I am sure there are others that I missed, but those are the ones that I spot immediately, especially on /pol/ I'm pretty sure they're not even trying over there.

                         Sure.  Identifying shills online is easy, but we're talking about a group of actual human beings, not just internet accounts.  We need real, physical force to arrest and detain the offenders.

                           The diligent researchers here and at /pol/ have already uncovered plenty of evidence to incriminate the offenders, but nothing is being done by the law enforcement agencies.  Unless we want all our work to be for naught, we need to form a coalition of individuals who are not afraid to step up and put an end to this.
