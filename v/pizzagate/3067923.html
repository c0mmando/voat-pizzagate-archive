<p>Part 1</p>
<p>Hi anons, so recently I have been conducting research into a totally off topic (to Q) set of historical queries which led me to various different sites and old articles. During the research I was looking into the ancient mythical connection between the number 72 and various different connections which, if you do not already know, connects to an ancient myth about the angels versus Baal and his 72 evil demons who were said to consume children, the flesh of people in general and, in short, what (I assume) several of you already know about given the pizza gate investigations. I should note that my personal investigation before I (literally) stumbled upon what I will explain here was actually a historical analysis on ancient cities as I was trying to determine a few things. So all of this was a completely random find. Typically I come on here during the night shift and I rarely post here during the day since I find the day shift to be full of dingleberry shitheads looking to slide important data or clueless mongoloids who want to power level for self importance. However and to the point, I am positive there will be some of you here who are true anons and true Q followers who value research and investigation above all else and will find this data interesting (to say the least) given the players involved. </p>
<p>I first came to this story which described a woman in NYC who owned a restaurant known to serve &quot;raw&quot; food with an emphasis on vegan. Apparently she was popular with her main clients being well known assholes such as Alec Baldwin who, again apparently, was a big fan of her &quot;raw lasagna&quot;. Her name is Sarma Melngailis who was arrested and the original claims were that she was arrested after &quot;ordering a pizza&quot;. Now when I first was skimming through to look for what I originally intended I said to myself &quot;wtf, why does this matter and why would places like fucking Vanity Fair, Daily Beast and the NYT give even a second of time to a dumb bitch restaurant owner from a vegan place?&quot; I will get into that but first, here is the initial article I found:</p>
<p><a href="https://archive.fo/gQCU5">https://archive.fo/gQCU5</a></p>
<p>BAKER</p>
<p>Part 2</p>
<p>So the article outlines a bunch of shit to attempt to make it abundantly clear that her arrest wasn\'t due to ordering a &quot;pizza&quot; but rather because she committed fraud and broke labor laws along with her &quot;husband&quot; Anthony Strangis which led them flee to evade arrest. I sat there again with the &quot;wtf&quot; thought in my mind about why this story mattered and why the fuck those said mentioned &quot;news&quot; groups gave a shit about this story. I mean, seriously, when do major &quot;news&quot; groups give two shits about an arrest for fraud, no racial connection, no deaths, no nothing of interest outside of the biggest issue - that she didn\'t order a pizza but was &quot;brainwashed&quot; into ordering a pizza. The shitshow Daily Beast now jumps in because, you know, when you are facing fraud charges you always want to make sure to tell the media (who for some reason find this important). She had to set the record straight on the pizza: &quot;Actually, the non-raw, non-vegan cheesy pie (plus a side of chicken wings) was only for the 300-plus-pound Strangis, who placed the order using his real name, thus leading authorities to the hotel&quot;. Daily Beast calls it a &quot;raw food empire&quot;:</p>
<p><a href="https://archive.fo/qWKuz">https://archive.fo/qWKuz</a></p>
<p>Now this is where it gets weird. The fatass dude, Strangis, who was living in Florida and even before he married the &quot;raw food&quot; bitch from NY, I repeat, even before he married her/moved up there he was conversing with numerous &quot;star&quot; level actors/actresses such as Alec Baldwin. So consider this for a moment, random fat guy without a job and absolutely zero connections to anything somehow has the ear of &quot;A list&quot; fucks like Baldwin, Woody Harrelson and Gisele Bundchen. Have you ever heard of a random nobody with zero connections randomly being associated with big name actors when said person has absolutely nothing of value that they would want? No, of course you haven\'t because it makes no fucking sense. Yet he was not only conversing/dealing with them but he also maintained a Twitter follower count of over 50k assholes. The question is of course why?</p>
<p>Oh but it gets more interesting my faithful anon fellow autists. He stated this back in 2012: “My Tweets have been featured in Rolling Stone, Funny or Die, People Magazine, Jimmy Kimmel Live. Proud Nerd and Gamer.” So now we add Jimmy Kimmel, Corey Booker (!!!) and vagina steam expert Christy Teigen.</p>
<p>So to sum this up. Fat loser with absolutely no connection to anything and (at that time) no clear job, no connection to &quot;raw food vegan&quot; bitch from NYC somehow, he somehow, has connection to Baldwin, Teigan, Harrelson, Corey Booker, Kimmel and many other &quot;big names&quot;. I ask again, why?</p>
<p>But even more interesting, this asshole along with his fraudster &quot;wife&quot; who fled the cops, defrauded in the amount of over one fucking million dollars and so on…. guess what… they are free and are not in prison despite all of that. These nobodies who on paper have nothing to offer and yet are connected to seriously high powered names… they are not in jail, they received a huge amount of media protection and they now changed their social media names and are still chirping away. He (stupidly) kept his same Twitter address and merely changed his name. Now he is (sigh..) &quot;Dorian Gray&quot;:</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/DorianGrayy_">https://twitter.com/DorianGrayy_</a></p>
<p>His attorney, Samuel Karliner, is a well known name in NYC as well. Remember when a Chris Cuomo (Governor of New York) aide was gunned down and shot? Well, Karliner represented one of the shooters:</p>
<p><a href="https://archive.fo/2sNqr">https://archive.fo/2sNqr</a></p>
<p>The only one who died - Carey Gabay — a 43-year-old Harvard-educated lawyer who’d worked for Cuomo’s Empire State Development Corporation. Yet there was no DNA or ballistic evidence to link to the event even happening or the &quot;shooters&quot; even having to do with it. They claim they weren\'t there, they claim the event never even happened and claims abound that the event was an assassination of Gabay by one shooter and there wasn\'t even a crowd around and that everything else was fabricated with no evidence to show any of it happened. </p>
<p>However, despite that, guess what happened, a &quot;foundation&quot; to end gun violence emerges:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.careygabayfoundation.org/">https://www.careygabayfoundation.org/</a></p>
<p>But back to the other subject. Karliner (attorney) also represented Yona Weinberg who is a notorious child molester/trafficker who fled NYC to Israel. A local rabbi in NYC stated:</p>
<p>&quot;Horowitz told The Journal News/lohud that he won\'t be intimidated by Weinberg, who used his position as a bar mitzvah tutor to gain access to his victims, who were 12 and 13.</p>
<p>He also sees the fight as part of a larger effort designed to thwart others from exposing sex offenders and warning potential victims of the danger. The Israeli legal maneuverings are key to this tactic, he said.&quot;</p>
<p><a href="https://archive.fo/XmcHv">https://archive.fo/XmcHv</a></p>
<p>and here is his disgusting history:</p>
<p><a href="https://archive.fo/vazVG">https://archive.fo/vazVG</a></p>
<p>The attorney also represented the rapist of an 83 year old woman:</p>
<p><a href="https://archive.fo/eVcCz">https://archive.fo/eVcCz</a></p>
<p>Part 3 (final)</p>
<p>But don\'t worry if you scam almost 1 million dollars through fraud, attorney Karliner will make sure you get no jail time:</p>
<p><a href="https://archive.fo/wlIJ0">https://archive.fo/wlIJ0</a></p>
<p>Attorney Karliner who married Jill Postelnek who once wrote </p>
<p><a href="https://archive.fo/56WbW">https://archive.fo/56WbW</a></p>
<p>Yet her husband is deeply connected with the foster system in NY and has taken many cases of youth offenders only for them to end in the very place in which his wife states causes mental issues:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2006/05/27/nyregion/27bus.html">https://www.nytimes.com/2006/05/27/nyregion/27bus.html</a></p>
<p>So we have an attorney who is connected to a claimed assassination of a Governor aide and represents clients who rape and molest children and is connected to the foster care system in which his wife works. But importantly, look who else frequented the &quot;raw food&quot; vegan spot in NYC. Bill Clinton:</p>
<p><a href="https://archive.fo/hfIL7">https://archive.fo/hfIL7</a></p>
<p>All of this, every square inch of this research, coming due to the media converging to make sure the story of the fact a raw food restaurant owner didn\'t herself order a \'CHEESE PIZZA&quot;. </p>
<p>My fellow anons, I have been investigating things a long time and this right here, this, this door will lead to a bunch of trafficking, molestation and the kidnapping of children through the foster system. It\'s all here and just needs to be dug out more and refined but this is it, I am certain of it. I just wanted to open this door for you all since I know there are a few like minded investigators on here like myself.This one is for you Q.</p>
<p>Additional information. Vanity Fair article linking Chelsea Clinton (among many others) to the spot in question:</p>

<p>MANY other names connected including NYT writer Porochista Khakpour. This is a big deal and will open the door to a shit load in terms of pizza shit including many other issues.</p>',

           Yet her husband is deeply connected with the foster system in NY and has taken many cases of youth offenders only for them to end in the very place in which his wife states causes mental issues:

          <p>
           So we have an attorney who is connected to a claimed assassination of a Governor aide and represents clients who rape and molest children and is connected to the foster care system in which his wife works. But importantly, look who else frequented the "raw food" vegan spot in NYC. Bill Clinton:

           All of this, every square inch of this research, coming due to the media converging to make sure the story of the fact a raw food restaurant owner didn't herself order a 'CHEESE PIZZA".

           My fellow anons, I have been investigating things a long time and this right here, this, this door will lead to a bunch of trafficking, molestation and the kidnapping of children through the foster system. It's all here and just needs to be dug out more and refined but this is it, I am certain of it. I just wanted to open this door for you all since I know there are a few like minded investigators on here like myself.This one is for you Q.

            Wow, that woman, Sarma co-wrote a raw food cookbook called Raw Food Real World (2005). Co-writer Matthew Kenney.  She is on the cover and shown throughout the book as a partner to this Matthew Kenney (MK).  I looked them up at one point and found it odd that they had split up shortly after publishing the book.  Was this yet another person promoting the vegan craze currently at an all time high right now as well as other nefarious activities as you have mentioned?
           </p>
           <p>
            The raw food push is part of the agenda IMO.  Sorry to all you vegans out there, but raw and vegan diets only weaken you, among other things.
Is it a coincidence that Impossible Foods, a maker of "plant based look alike meat and other food items," is across the street from Planned Parenthood (based in Silicon Valley)?  Or that the UN has a website that is tackling the world's most urgent problem.....meat?!?!!  Or that investors of Impossible Foods include Bill Gates and Google Ventures?!?
           </p>
           <p>
            I know I'm may be off topic here but my suggestions is to stay away from anything called, Beyond Meat or made from Impossible Foods currently being sold in fast foods restaurants.

             Hey I made this account to say this and will probably make a post about it eventually but your comment triggered me so I must reply.  Aajonus Vonderplanitz promotes the raw food diet and his work is groundbreaking.  With the help of his work we will be the first modern humans to live to 125 years EASILY rather than inevitably require hospital and medical assistance someday.  Veganism is a death cult which is promoted because there is no equivalent level of nutrition to be found in plants as there are in raw meats(some parents in Europe were tried in court for feeding their infants a vegan diet which is nutritionally devoid of what is most important for development. The ratio for health he recommends are Raw fats up to 50% of the daily intake from butter, cocount cream, advocados(very good fat even though its a vegetable you cant eat plenty of these if you require more fat), raw cream/milk and the rest proteins/fat from raw meat(cooked fat molecules pop like popcorn and grow to 10-15 times their original size and harden within the body). While I agree a raw food diet based on plants will weaken you and is basically a fast, raw meats and raw dairy/unsalted raw butter is necessary to ensure optimal longevity and health.  That being said, plants can be juiced with a masticating juicer to supplement vitamins and enzymes and promotes healing combined with the raw diet. Vonderplanitz was most likely assassinated for exposing vaccines as well as being open about chemtrails/Rothschild agenda.
            </p>
            <p>
             Basically when you cook food you cauterize the cells/kill the enzymes/bacteria/vitamins etc and your body must work overtime trying to digest and perform basic functions due to the "germ theory" we are told which is a lie.  Everything they say is a lie, put ice on your wounds: Lie. Heat is better for healing.  Use baths between 100-105 F for 45 minutes with raw milk, apple cider vinegar, clay(absorbed toxins you expel into the water are captured and the clay keeps it from reentering the body through the pores by absorbing them).  Drink water: Lie.  Water makes you dry similar to if you apply water on wood it will crack eventually and it leeches minerals from your body and denigrates things inside your intestine if you keep drinking it too much. If you feel thirst drink raw milk or vegetable juice or terramin clay(riverbed source volcanic sources contain heavy metals) in 2 ounces of mineral water(like Gerolsteiner) provides minerals.If you must drink water only drink 2-4 ounces of filtered water for example after working out or sports. What is being craved is not the water but in fact the minerals which water would normally have instead of the toxic chemicals from water purification(chemically treated water).
            </p>
            <p>
             They say you need salt for minerals but we cant digest rock we aren't plants. Salt only works to kill individual cells which shrivel up and die when they contact the salt.  One grain of salt kills up to a million red blood cells or 2 million cant remember.
             <br/>
             They say that you need fiber, totally false unless you are on the SAD(Standard American Diet) where everything you eat putrefies inside you and must be expelled with fiber since it is basically indigestible the fiber acts as a plunger pushing everything in front of it out and cleans out the pipes so to speak but this is not loving for the body. 
They say Bacteria is bad, false.  Bacteria is necessary for digestion and most people suffer from lack of bacteria and suffer from depression/adrenal exhaustion because their bodies are working overtime and without the necessary tools. We are told to take antibiotics when we get a virus but a virus is necessary to clean out toxic tissues, the antibiotics are literally poison that your body must detoxify from eventually and the body heals despite them.

             I went on a bit of a health rant but I hope this information could help. Knowing all this it is amazing we are alive at all.  I can email the PDFs to all his books if someone wants them.

             You are 100 hundred percent correct about staying away from these new "meats".

              I appreciate your rant.  And I agree, except I'm misunderstanding something about Vonderplanitz (weird name).  He promoted the raw food diet to include meat?  If so, he's probably one of the few.  That would horrify vegas.
I completely agree with you about the lies and some of what you are saying makes complete sense regarding water etc..  One thing I am learning is that whatever "they" tell you or are pushing, do the opposite.  And, right now the push is to veganism.
I have a fabulous source of raw milk and filtered well water, but I never thought to add minerals.
I will see if I can find his books online.  Thanks!!!

               If you live that long on the raw diet your life will be worth living because you'll grow younger and not older! You are totally right though! He said this: "Whatever the medical industry tells you do the exact opposite 99% of the time and you'll be fine" haha!
