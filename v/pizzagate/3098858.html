<p>HOUSTON, Texas (KTRK) -- Houston Public Library is apologizing after a man charged for sexually assaulting a child was allowed to entertain children at Drag Queen storytime.</p>
<p>The library said Friday that a review revealed the volunteer never completed a background check before he was allowed to participate in the program.</p>
<p>Albert Alfonso Garza, 32, was last seen reading to children at the Montrose Library in September 2018.</p>

<p>ABC13 Eyewitness News has learned Garza was charged with child sex assault in 2008. According to records, <strong>his victim was a child under the age of 14</strong> years old.</p>
<p>The library said appropriate action is being taken to ensure every participant in every program is verified to ensure similar incidents cannot happen in the future.</p>
<p>Each program is supervised by staff, and all children are accompanied by a parent or guardian, the library said.</p>
<p>Friday, Houston Public Library released this statement:</p>
<p>We were made aware today that one participant for Drag Queen storytime who read at the September 29, 2018, Drag Queen Storytime has a criminal background that should have prevented him from participating in the program.</p>
<p>We assure you that this participant will not be involved in any future HPL programs.</p>
<p>In our review of our process and of this participant, <strong>we discovered that we failed to complete a background check as required by our own guidelines</strong>. We deeply regret this oversight and the concern this may cause our customers. We realize this is a serious matter.</p>
<p>Every program sponsored by HPL is supervised by HPL staff, and all children are accompanied by a parent and/or guardian. No participant is ever alone with children, and we have not received any complaints about any inappropriate behavior by participants at storytimes.</p>
<p>We are taking the appropriate action to ensure that the status of every participant in every program throughout our system is verified. We will continue to review our process to ensure that this cannot happen again.</p>
<p>Once again, we apologize for our failure to adhere to our own process in this matter and to the hundreds of parents and caregivers who have enjoyed this program with their children. </p>

            Libraries are where young people go to learn, so they infiltrate. They burnt the Conroe County library because of all the great books contained. I read how to make rocket engines when I was 7. Those books are banned now, unless you pay to go to college. When I was a kid the local deputy would have hauled these freaks off to parts unknown just for being freaks, without bothering to inform the Sheriff.Times have changed in 40 years.

            I'm all for kids to do more reading, but this is inexcusable. The library should be shutdown and whoever brought that thing in to do the reading should be arrested and go to prison. Enough is enough with this trans bullshit. IDC who calls me transphobic. This is what the left pushes, trans and hypersexuality of children. So fucking sick.

             I agree. You know, women are the worst with this stuff.  They defend gays and cross dressers and drag queens.  They think they are their gfs or something.  They feel a kinship or something?  I have heard younger women at parties and get togethers saying Oh he's so cute!  He helps me with my fashion tips, etc. They trade recipes etc.  It's time to stop this immoral support.

              Women, I'm afraid, are easily led... speaking in general terms of course.  Politically naive and insecure... fodder for manipulative forces.

              They also defeat blacks, Muslims, illegal immigrants and pedophiles (LGBT) because of their irrational feelz. We wouldn't have half the degeneracy in the west if women would still know their place.
