<p>&quot;SATAN IS A FAGGOT! ALL HAIL THE PUISSANT WORD OF POWER MOST GREAT NAME SCHEMHAMPHORAS! AS ABOVE, SO BELOW!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You kids are gonna fry like (BABY MUMMIES...)&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;This is what it looks like when I sweet talk first twin Barbara Bush:
Barbara B,
I\'m sorry for putting you in an awkward position. It would have been an awkward position for me to put you in in high school if I had wanted to make a contact that validated my uncle\'s college experience and how that reflects on me, which is why I avoided you and Jenna and went to McCallum. It didn\'t turn out like I had imagined which is why I have second thoughts about making a contact that validates my heritage, but I know I am in less of a position to keep your attention. Its not likely that you are gonna allow me to introduce myself as the nephew of a Yalie 1968 grad in your father\'s class and be given all the opportunity in the world to bond with you out of similar known fate with you because that reference has become passe.
I would still like to though. This is hard for me because I don\'t know if you read what I write you. It could be all going to your Other folder or you refuse to acknowledge what I am saying by reading it. Anyways, I loved my mother to death and I am desperate for a symbolic victory for me romantically through my vicarious standard for a worthy young lady through her example, and you are the obvious go to. I really think I can get into Yale and if I can I think you should take to me given my matching your alma mater, but that would require a drastic commitment from you, to make my acquaintance in a way that would give me an opportunity to date and court you while I am just beginning to account for my providence as a man and eligibility toward the female sex.
I just want to say, I admire what you do with Global Health Corps and I am deeply attracted to you, which is legitimate considering all your positive attributes I assure you, so if you see something worth taking, I can guarantee you I am going to make the most of my potential. I love you, and I could die on the spot if you were willing to administer the phenomenal experience of becoming married to me, because it would mean I was so complete, although I would also look forward to enjoying you for the entire rest of my life, in the justice you could potentially do for me accounting for such a universal variable as fate or destiny.
love,
David F. McCullar&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;And the aliens have a contract with NSA and NATO to harbor human bodies in suspended animation for their genetic engineering †††&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;That\'s why they are called #NationOfTheThirdEye /// the real Men In Black are olive complected intraterrestrials that ride in black cadillacs and harass UFO witnesses with scare tactics in response to their experiences. They are not in association with the Federal Government and they possess alien technology that is far superior to the Nazi technology that the federal government has reverse engineered from Alien and Nazi technological phenomenon.
This is an intelligence bureau that has galactic jurisdiction that is operating on Earth courtesy of the Galactic Federation and Earth Coincidence Control Office until a world government emerges on Earth for us to become eligible for representation in the Galactic Federation †††&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;What could possibly happen? Would you like to become abducted by Greys for their genetic research??? One of the multiple preternatural spirit bodies known as afrits, or jinn, could manifest on the vibrational frequency that our matter inhabits and in your vulnerability you could become susceptible to a haunting †††

<p>&quot;Gray I hate you. Your ugly ass mother thinks she can boss your dad
and my dad around concurrently and criticize everyone including your
pathetic soulless faggot ass while she has no heart and tried to
offer us sanctimony for losing my mother. Then you told me I
couldn\'t go to Austin High after I met Jenna Bush there. I have half
a mind to murder you because while you were hiding me in the twins
shadows because I am richer than you Barbara got raped, but your
homoerotic pederast perverted faggot self will throw stones in a
glass house like a son of a bitch when you receive this message
because I am on a pr tyrrade to sabotage your unholy career as the
worst motherfucking operative the White House ever saw while Bush
was in office as governor and president. I will never talk to you
again you stupid motherfucking pussy. Eat shit you faggot. You new
money slave motherfucker die young and see how your kids feel about
it so I can turn the tables on your white trash poor ass and torment
them just like your whore of a mother lawyer bitch did to me because
you owe it to me to be my slave you fucking slave. Don\'t even cry. I
want to fight you. Don\'t rationalize shit. I am coming for your
white trash ass and you better run.&quot;</p>

            I saw a video the other day and while it was over the top in the breadth of accusations, it said not only is Michelle Obama a man as is widely reported... But that other first ladies have been men!

            And there were some very manly pictures, the most pointed was Barbara Bush...

"Barbara got raped, but your homoerotic pederast perverted faggot self"  Is that what he is saying there?!

             , David F McCullar facebook page he talks about the same Barbara (Bush? i dont remember, its deep in the post. this guy was crazy, posted too much), and some Gray, like in the email. And in this archive
             <a href="http://archive.is/x0xcq">
              http://archive.is/x0xcq
             </a>
             Michael McCullar apears as relative. I don't know if it is his father or what, but they are related. They are the same people from the email. I think im not mistaking.
            </p>
            <p>
             I should find the posts of him talking of barbara and gray and make a pic.

            HERE MORE KINDLE QUOTES:

           <blockquote>
            <p>
             "Weroance shared from Refusing to be a Man: Essays on Social Justice by John Stoltenberg
Men as a class know that their social and cultural and economic advantage over and against women depends absolutely upon the continuance of involuntary pregnancy, involuntary gestation, involuntary parturition, and involuntary child rearing. Men know that the very continuity of their gender class—the continuity of “masculinity” as a distinct and imperious gender identity and the continuity of “men” as a distinct and imperious power bloc—requires that everyone born without a penis live her whole life palpably circumscribed and controlled by the will of anyone born with a penis."
            </p>
            <p>
             "Weroance shared from The Illuminatus! Trilogy: The Eye in the Pyramid, The Golden Apple, Leviathan by Robert Shea
“About this gnosis,” Saul asked, “is it the orthodox theological position that the illuminations or visions were actually coming from the Devil and not from God?” “Yes. That’s where Manicheanism enters the picture,” Father Muldoon said. “The Manicheans made exactly the same charge against the orthodox church. According to their way of looking at it, the God of orthodox Christianity and orthodox Judaism, was the Devil. The god they contacted through their own peculiar rites was the real god. This, of course, is still the teaching of Satanists today."
            </p>
            <p>
             "Weroance shared from Intercourse by Andrea Dworkin
In many cultures and tribes, men can be similarly possessed; and the key to the possession—the dreams, the sex, the physical reality of desire, the obsession—is that the woman herself is magical and evil; through wickedness and magic she exerts illegitimate (therefore magical; therefore wicked; therefore originating in Satan) power over men."
            </p>
            <p>
             "Weroance shared from Servant of the Bones by Anne Rice
“I recall in Paris a clever satanic magician in a room full of gaslight. The wallpaper was most intriguing to me. A strange black coat hung on a hook. Life almost tempted me. Gaslight and machines; carriages rolling on cobbled streets. But I killed the mysterious man and retreated once more into the bones."
            </p>

              Just say Zionists.  Jews is too meaningless a term. Not all jews are bad and not all non-jews are good.   Zionists are the f'ing problem, and those who go along with them.    If you say jews you look like a racist!

              I assume anyone bringing up anti-semitism is trying to discredit this community. It's no different than the Clinton supporters pretending to be Trump supporters and sPray painting racist messages.

                That's great for you but it's not cool for you to come here and undermine this place with your rhetoric. If you care about this story I would assume you would try not to bring any more heat onto us. If you don't care about it and want to discredit it then you're doing a good job of that.

              I think it's important to avoid framing it that way. Certainly there are many respectable jewish people... I think I was seeing the term Zaharian on veteranstoday articles

                    the catholics &amp; scientologists are probably neck deep in this same shit... so it just simply isn't accurate to call out the jews, even if israel is top of it all that message will not ring true to the masses

                     Don't lie to yourself. The names involved in this shit reads like a Jerusalem phonebook. You can criticize the Catholics and Scientologists, even ridicule them with impunity. Try doing that to the Jews, see how many friends you have left the next morning.
