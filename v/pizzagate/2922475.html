            There's also a connection between the
            <strong>
             Bronfman
            </strong>
            family and
            <strong>
             Clinton
            </strong>
            family! And it's connected to media and
            <strong>
             dating apps
            </strong>
            .
           </p>
           <p>
            The father of Sara &amp; Clare Bronfman is Edgar Bronfman Sr., the half brother of them is Edgar Bronfman Jr., who is a Director of IAC, beside Chelsea Clinton.

            (scroll down to "Board of Directors").
 IAC is a family of companies doing media, dating apps and other suspicious business, here is some stuff on it:

           <p>
            On the Bronfman family clan:

            The Bronfman sisters' father Edgar Bronfman was part of a top-level billionaire Mossad group called "Mega Group". Jeffrey Epstein's benefactor Les Wexner was Bronfman's partner in The Mega Group.
           </p>
           <p>
            Mega Group had major 9/11 ties, at the very highest level, and they were probably behind the Monica Lewinsky scandal after Mossad/Mega Group was caught wiretapping the Clinton White House:

            August 31, 2001 issue of Executive Intelligence Review.
Israeli Spies: 'Mega Was Not
an Agent; Mega Was the Boss'
           </p>
           <p>
            "According to the Post account, in January 1997, the National Security Agency (NSA) had intercepted a phone conversation between an Israeli official at the embassy in Washington, and Danny Yatom, the head of the Mossad, Israel's foreign intelligence service. The official sought permission from the spy boss to "go to Mega" in order to obtain a copy of a confidential letter that had been sent by then-U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher to Palestinian Authority President Yasser Arafat, concerning U.S. assurances about a recently negotiated agreement for an Israeli military withdrawal from the Hebron area in the West Bank. Yatom, according to the NSA intercept, rejected the request, admonishing his agent, "This is not something we use Mega for."
           </p>
           <p>
            "Under the innocent headline, "Titans of Industry Join Forces To Work for Jewish Philanthropy," Wall Street Journal staff reporter Lisa Miller reported on an April 1998 gathering of some 20 Jewish billionaires, at the Manhattan apartment of hedge-fund manager Michael Steinhardt. That gathering involved some of the most powerful names in the Jewish lobby in America, starting with Edgar Bronfman, the chairman of the World Jewish Congress. Others included: Charles Bronfman, Edgar's brother and a top executive of the family's flagship Seagrams Corp.; Leslie Wexler of Limited, Inc.; Charles Schusterman, chairman of Samson Investment Co. of Tulsa, Oklahoma; Harvey "Bud" Meyerhoff, a fabulously wealthy and powerful Baltimore real estate magnate; Laurence Tisch, chairman of Loews Corp.; Max Fisher, the Detroit oil magnate and Republican Party powerhouse; bagel magnate Max Lender; and Leonard Abramson, the founder of U.S. Healthcare.
           </p>
           <p>
            According to the Journal account, the Mega Group was founded in 1991 by Wexler and Charles Bronfman, to add greater clout to the Israeli lobby, by establishing an informal, but all-powerful policymaking group, able to deploy billions of dollars in "charitable" funds for the maximum effect on U.S. policy toward Israel, the Mideast, and other issues of paramount importance to the Jewish megabillionaires. The Mega Group convenes twice a year, for two-day sessions, where, behind closed doors, the members make life-and-death decisions, affecting U.S. policy. Membership is by invitation only; the meetings are secret (the Wall Street Journal story was the only coverage to ever appear in the U.S. media about the existence of the Mega Group, before the publication of this EIR account); and the members each kick in $30,000 in annual dues, to cover "operating expenses" for the twice-yearly sessions."

            Michael Havers was involved in the Playland/Mayfair paedophile rings, according to a book written by victim-witness Anthony Daly entitled
            <em>
             Playland: Secrets of a Forgotten Scandal

            And Havers did indeed protect top ranking paedophile Peter Hayman (who was also involved with the Playland/Mayfair paedophile rings):

           </p>

            Havers also intervened in attempted lawsuits brought by paedophile Roger Gleaves:

              <p>
               Not a problem.  I knew I'd read of Michael Havers somewhere before and when I saw Peter Hayman's name, I remembered it from the Scepticpeg blog.

            Hi,

             @RakerKey
            </a>
            , thank you very much for posting this.
           </p>
           <p>
            Have you maybe seen our rules in the sidebar? (When on mobile, please switch to 'desktop view'.)
           </p>
           <p>
            They are a bit different from the rules on
            <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/v/GreatAwakening">
             v/GreatAwakening
            </a>
            and
            <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/v/theawakening">
             v/theawakening
            </a>
            . We require to have at least one link in the OP, and to back up everything that is not common knowledge with a link, too.
           </p>
           <p>
            Would you please be able to add some links to your post accordingly? That would be terrific!
           </p>
           <p>
            I will give you our '24 hours Grace' flair, so that you'll have some time to edit.
           </p>
           <p>
            Please don't hesitate to get back to me or
            <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/u/Vindicator">
             @Vindicator

            if you need help with the edit.
           </p>
           <p>
            Thank you, and please keep up the good work.
