They recently(Aug 2016 <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/27/business/dealbook/abbotts-no-good-very-bad-ma-week.html">http://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/27/business/dealbook/abbotts-no-good-very-bad-ma-week.html)</a>) had 
some problems as they tried to acquire two different companies simultaneously which both had some issues. They had tried to 
acquire Alere, which makes medical tests. As part of the agreement Abbott was supposed to seek merger approval&amp;close 
the deal as usual, but when it became apparent that Alere was being investigated for regulation problems over foreign sales 
practice its annual financial report was delayed. This appears to have already been known at the time Abbott signed the deal. In 
the mean time Abbott tried to acquire St. Judge Medical also to expand into the cardio market (and epipens). But a report 
revealed by Muddy Waters Research showed that their pacemakers were vulnerable to cyber attack&amp;that revenue would be 
halfed over a two year period. In order to reverse the deal with Alere that company claimed in a suit that Abbott didn\'t take the 
agreed to steps to seek merger approval in an attempt to purposely thwart the buyout.</p>
<p>The article says, &quot;&quot;Maybe they did these deals out of desperation to bridge a growth gap or something, in terms of being willing 
to overlook things,” said Mr. Funtleyder, who also is an adjunct professor of public health at Columbia University. “Wall Street is 
not going to think this is an honest mistake.”&quot;&amp;that\'s the problem Abbott has. It might appear they didn\'t due their due 
diligence before trying to acquire the companies.</p>
<p>The article admits, &quot;The report disclosing problems with St. Jude Medical’s cardiac devices came from an investment firm, which 
had bet on the decline of St. Jude shares. The founder of that firm, Carson Block, received the information from MedSec, which 
is a cybersecurity research firm. After MedSec discovered the vulnerabilities, it contacted Mr. Block. Justine Bone, MedSec’s 
chief executive, said on Bloomberg TV on Thursday that MedSec also benefited from the decline in St. Jude’s stock price this 
week.&quot;</p>
<p>And that seems likely. There\'s always a motive. I personally think the chances that a pacemaker would be tampered with are 
remote but that measures should be built in to prevent that.</p>
<p>But this company being based in Chicago&amp;having such a big hand in recent medical company mergers might mean their is 
more to this company that should be researched further as time allows.</p>

            Apparently some people aren't too happy a lot of these people's money is offshore. This article 
(
            <a href="http://www.chicagotribune.com/business/ct-companies-offshore-cash-1006-biz-20151006-story.html">
             http://www.chicagotribune.com/business/ct-companies-offshore-cash-1006-biz-20151006-story.html)

            ) says "Illinois Fortune 500 
companies have $135 billion stashed overseas:report". The article features a picture of the sign from the Abbott company,&amp;
the article says "AbbVie, Abbott,&amp;Caterpillar among U.S. companies with most cash parked overseas," &amp; "$135 billion in 
profits overseas that aren't subject to U.S. taxes." The study was done by Citizens for Tax Justice&amp;Illinois PIRG which details 
offshore tax havens. But Apple was the company topping the list. "Combined, AbbVie, Abbott&amp;Caterpillar have $64 billion in 
earnings reinvested indefinitely in foreign subsidiaries." AbbVie shareholder report says $23 billion earned from foreign subs 
have been "indefinitely reinvested for continued use in foreign operations."
           </p>
           <p>
            "Other Illinois companies mentioned in the report as having at least some money held offshore include: Anixter, Archer Daniels 
Midland, Baxter, Boeing, CDW, Corn Products, Deere, Dover, Illinois Tool Works, Kraft, LKQ, McDonald's, Mondelez, Motorola 
Solutions, Navistar, Tenneco&amp;W.W. Grainger." Well folks that's a lot of companies that are all headed up by the same people 
in the list given at Abbott's website. McDonalds, Illinois Tools, Motorola, Tenneco, Corn Products, etc.
           </p>
           <p>
            So maybe somebody is trying to build a case for tax evasion here or at least trying to build a case for tax policy reform to 
repatriate that money. As the article says, "The U.S. is among a few developed countries that charge taxes on income gained 
overseas. Some companies have said the U.S. needs to change its tax policies if it wants companies based here to be 
competitive&amp;to continue to build operations stateside. They also say they have extensive foreign operations&amp;many 
options when making decisions related to expansion, new product sourcing,&amp;mergers&amp;acquisitions."

            Another sets of articles by the New York Times 
(
            <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/11/business/international/abbott-india-suicide-inhuman-drug-sales-tactics.html">

            )  is critical of Abbott's overseas operation in 
India alleging the demand for sales drove a worker to suicide in that he left a note saying that was his reason for killing himself. 
Two hundred&amp;fifty workers went on strike for a day. But what seems more problematic is the Times found that managers 
told staff to holy "health camps" where reps. performed tests on patients to increase business for doctors who would prescribe 
Abbott drugs. These were held at doctor's offices&amp;community events. This is a problem because it could be seen as 
practicing medicine without license, which is a crime,&amp;there is a ethical quid pro quo that could have been violated. Vivek 
Gupta, manager of sales in Northern India claims he was fired after the company pressured him to make his reps. do more 
screenings to promote Abbott's new multivitamin for nerve damage. (Surbex Star is the product if I'm understanding the article 
correctly which is used for neuropathy in people with diabetes.) It was also said that management was pressuring employees to 
purchase drugs with their own money to meet sales targets.&amp;there were allegations of discounts afforded to the 
government being offered to private wholesalers as a kickback. There's a note that Abbot acquired Solvay Pharmaceutical of 
Belgium for 6.2 billion in 2010.
           </p>
           <p>
            Another problematic company listed as companies that at one time employed people working for Abbott now was Archer Daniels 
Midland (ADM). Wikipedia has the info (
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lysine_price-fixing_conspiracy">
             https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lysine_price-fixing_conspiracy)
            </a>
            ) In the 1990s there was a 
conspiracy for price fix the animal feed additive lysine by companies that used high-tech fermentation techniques. The 
companies listed by wikipedia as being involved was Archer Daniels midland, the Japanese Ajinomoto&amp;Kyowa Hakko Kogyo, 
the Korean Sewon America Inc.&amp;Cheil Jedang Ltd. Apparently there were fined levied ($105 million plus a $30 million fines 
involving citric acid market as well)and three year prison sentence for three executives of AMD that colluded with the other 
companies. The foreign companies settled with the U.S. DOJ AntiTrust Division in 1996. The price of lysine had risen 70% in nine 
months during the conspiracy. Buyers of lysine in U.S.&amp;Canada sued&amp;got $80 to $100 million in damages back&amp;ADM 
paid out $38 million to settle with its shareholders. Cities involved in the investigation included Tokyo, Paris, Mexico City,&amp;
Hong Kong. Some of the principal actors were Vice Chairman Michael D. Andreas&amp;Mark Whitacre the informant who 
apparently had embezzled some money&amp;so got pinched for that. The company paid out $400 million on part of the class 
action case involving high fructose corn syrup. "The ADM investigation, in turn, convinced antitrust prosecutors that price-fixing 
was a far more pervasive problem than they had suspected&amp;led to prosecutions of cartels in vitamins, fax paper,&amp;
graphite electrodes. European&amp;Canadian regulators have started to crack down on the problem, too.[9] Once a crime that 
rarely attracted the notice of federal authorities, price-fixing is now under attack by governments around the world. Billions of 
dollars have already been paid in antitrust fines to the U.S. government since Whitacre first blew the whistle in 1992." Vitamins?
           </p>

            They may be referring to this case 
(

            ). 
Apparently vitamin C is also an additive in feed. Customers sued in U.S. court&amp;won, but it was dismissed as the Chinese 
companies (North China Pharmaceutical Group Corp.&amp;its manufacturing unit, Hebei Welcome Pharmaceutical Co) were acting 
under Chinese law. The companies which purchased the vitamin for use in their products were Animal Science Products Inc.&amp;
Ranis Co.,

            Here's another animal feed vitamin case. Janet Reno was really pushing for this, "globalized economy" anti-trust stuff.

           <p>
            When doing random searches about companies that showed up in my reserach also noticed a program for hiring military 
officers for civilian work. (
            <a href="http://leadersinc.com/recruiting/military-officers-transitioning/current-clients/">
             http://leadersinc.com/recruiting/military-officers-transitioning/current-clients/)
            </a>
            ) Some of the companies 
listed associated with people that work for Abbott, are participants like Motorola, Target, Tenneco, Caterpillar, Bayer, Abbott 
Labs. There seem to be a lot of medical&amp;pharma companies like GE healthcare, Merck, Pfizer, Pharmacia, Bayer, The 
program is based in Florida, veteran owned&amp;operated,&amp;Buddy Webster is the President. Tom Quinn, a former Ranger, is 
a partner&amp;worked for Tenneco, but the division he worked for was sold&amp;he launched LEADERS, the program I found in 
doing my research.  (
            <a href="http://leadersinc.com/about-us/our-team/tom-quinn/">
             http://leadersinc.com/about-us/our-team/tom-quinn/)
            </a>
            ) It indicates less than 24 employees&amp;100 
employees placed in six months, so it's a small operation. I have a feeling Tenneco was a place a lot of vets worked at when 
Tenneco was bigger. Probably Tom Quinn's previous experience with them helps him place vets into jobs at corporations where 
Tenneco people now work.

            Additional story possibly related: The Chicago Tribune reported a jeep being stolen from the lot at Navistar that was then used in a 
theft. Navistar makes heavy trucks.

That's all I have for now, but it's a damn good start. Connect Board of Directors of Companies to Clinton Foundation and Obama when you do research.
