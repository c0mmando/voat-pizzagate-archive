<p>President Woodrow Wilson summed up Freemasonry very well:</p>
<p>&quot;Some of the biggest men in the United States, in the field of commerce and manufacture, are afraid of something.  They know there is a power somewhere, so organized, so subtle, so watchful, so interlocked, so complete, so pervasive that they had better not speak above their breath when they speak in condemnation of it.&quot;</p>
<p>Freemasonry is full of lies, murder, sex trafficking, and every other vice one could ever imagine.  Masonry\'s nationwide organization of men from most walks of life provides one of the most efficient private intelligence networks imaginable.</p>
<p>Here is an interesting excerpt from questions and answers during a Master Mason\'s initiation process:</p>
<p>Q - &quot;Does Freemasonry have any relation to the heretical Johannite Sects of the Mid East known as the \'St. John Christian\' who revere John the Baptist but despise Jesus Christ as they term the \'Vomiter of Lies?\'&quot;</p>
<p>A - &quot;Yes.  The Johannite link is an allusion to a secret church of St. John, i.e., a gnostic sect of Nestorian/Gnostic Christians who deny the Divinity of Jesus Christ.</p>
<p>The use of the Johns is to lull Christians into acceptance of Freemasonry\'s religious allusions as legitimate.  They are not legitimate references but deceptive pretenses designed to seduce the naive.</p>
<p>The latent meaning is that the order is the secret church of Jesus Christ.  This is a lie, but the naive are allowed to conclude this if they so wish.  Masons actually who seek light/understanding are led into the darkness of moral corruption and ego defense mechanisms.  They are allowed to believe and speak nonsense under the auspices of the order by men, their dominant masters, who know better but must conceal the Truth from their submissives...&quot;</p>
<p>Responses to additional questions:</p>
<p>A - &quot;...the Mason is gradually seduced away from the normative morality into a new age world of false morality in which the member withdraws from his former life\'s attachments and substitutes them with Freemasonry\'s false promises. The member becomes thusly increasingly dependent upon the order that he will lie or commit criminal acts on his behalf, for he has nothing else in this world or the next to sustain him and dare not oppose the peer pressure of his fellow masons\' retaliation...&quot;</p>
<p>A - &quot;...Masonry is a cult, based on mediocrity and mendacity.  It is elitist, racist, and misogynist.  Masons come firstly.  The notion of masons advocating democratic freedoms and rights is pure nonsense.  It is a deceptive lie.  Their practical volume of the sacred law is the book for tyrants by Machiavelli, \'The Prince,\' or the egotistic selfishness of the philosopher, Ayn Rand (a woman!), who advocated a might is right, laissez-faire capitalism with no regard for social welfare for the disadvantaged...&quot;</p>
<p>A - &quot;...Masonic propaganda through the internet is a deliberate means of deception by evasion, deception, and denial of the Truth.  It is not what they say, it is what they conceal that the public needs to know.&quot;</p>
<p>We are all aware by now of the 2 appendant bodies of Freemasonry - The Shriners and The Royal Order of Jesters.  The Shriners\' original name was &quot;The Arabic Order of the Nobles of the Mystic Shrine&quot; or A.A.O.N.M.S.  = A MASON.  The Shrine\'s ritual is taken from an Arabic Sufi Secret Sect.  Freemasonry and Qaballah occultism owe much to Sufism.  The Muslim Brotherhood is a Sufi Secret Society.</p>
<p>The Jesters pride themselves in having control of all leadership positions at all Shrine Temples in the U.S. and Canada as well as the Imperial Shrine leadership.  Also, they have risen through the ranks in every body of Masonry, including the Scottish rite, York rite, Rosicrucians, Red Cross of Constantine, Eastern Star, and the Demolay organizations.</p>
<p>Former Freemason and author of &quot;The Brotherhood,&quot; Stephen Knight, states:
&quot;There is no defense against an evil which only the victims and the perpetrators know exists.&quot;
Stephen Knight died in 1985, a year after the publication of this book, at the age of 33 from a cerebral aneurysm.</p>

            Freemasonry is clearly an anti-Christ religion:
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             The Freemason[s] littered Rome with posters showing the Archangel Michael defeated on the ground trampled beneath a triumphant Lucifer. In their protests against the Catholic Church, the Freemasons also displayed the black flag of the heretic Giordano Bruno, a Dominican friar who promoted materialistic pantheism, a central belief of Freemasonry.   .... Freemasonry seeks the dissolution of morality because they are convinced that unless they corrupt morality they cannot defeat the Catholic Church since they cannot defeat it with logical arguments.
            </p>
            <p>
             Freemasonry has also an esoteric aspect, which is not Christian. They have rituals and ceremonies which are esoteric, which they openly admit, and such ceremonials are contrary to the faith. Their symbols and rituals demonstrate that they are against the divine truths in the Gospel – these things transmit show that Freemasonry is another religion. I repeat, freemasonry is another religion, it is an anti-Christ religion.
Even when they do good works, philanthropy and so forth, these dangerous things remain.
            </p>

            EYEOFHORUS wrote the following here on Voat, unfortunately I believe this could be very close to the truth and makes perfect sense.

            Trump isn't a Rothschild asset at all, the Rothschild's are furious about Trump getting into power. What's going on is actually very simple, we have Gloablists Vs Zionists, the Globalists are the ones who prioritize setting up a UN world government funded by climate taxes - Rockefeller, Rothschild, Soros are key players, Hillary, Obama etc work for them. UN and EU is all part of this agenda. The Zionists are the ones who prioritize Israel-first, protecting Israel and taking control of the countries surrounding them . As long as you leave these guys alone, they won't bother you, unless you are a neighbor. Some of the top ones aren't very visible, the more visible players are Rupert Murdoch, Breitbart, Infowars, WikiLeaks, Trump, Brexit campaign etc. These guys all used to work together, but now that the globalist plan is in it's advanced stages, Soros and Co had decided that a firm hand would be needed with Israel, as otherwise nobody would trust the world government if Israel could get away with whatever they wanted. The Zionists weren't happy with the way things were going, so they've now started to dismantle bit by bit the Globalist project for world government. That is what Brexit is about, that is what Trump is about, that is why Trump is not going along with the climate change agenda.

            How do we stop it? Keep shining light on the situation until there's nowhere left for the secrets to be hidden.

            If masonry as a whole, is corrupt, it will fall. If the issues are being caused by just a few out of many, those few will be exposed.
           </p>
           <p>
            Should they refuse to evolve and draw the line at "do no harm to children and do no harm to those who have not harmed you", well, I'm sure that people power will overcome, seeing as how Freemasons are hardly hidden behind secrecy these days - most anyone can look them up and study at least their public writings, as a starting point.

              Never, I believe they hold their threats (or our) however.   I can say the penalties are ingrained from the first day for speaking.   I honestly have nothing to say I've seen or heard though.

                My three oddest instructions were to watch the Dan Brown movie, read the dead sea scrolls,  and the Torah.  I know it's crazy but that I was told holds "most" of the answers between them.  I've always looked for the most up to date translations of them, but I feel it's granting too much trust to interpret an interpretation.  I only trust us goats most of the time.

                  I'm really happy you got out. That's really brave of you. You're lucky because I've always heard that, since one would know the secrets, they wouldn't be allowed to leave freely. I hope you stay away from it.

                   Don't be foolish there was no bravery involved, I'm not trying to claim recognition I don't deserve.  I was in the military and won't even take recognition for the minor yet technical effort I spent in that.  Honestly I just quit going to their meetings and answering their phone calls.  There was and is nothing brave in what I have done, ever.

                    Well if you quit going to meetings, answering their phone calls and joined the military then I think you seem like you're pretty hard on yourself. Why would it be foolish for me to think that's brave? I think anyone who can do all of that is pretty brave. It seems pretty dangerous to leave something like that. I'm not mocking you like a lot of shills around here. But, if that's how you feel, I'm sorry if that offended you.

                     You didn't offend me at all, I just didn't want to give people the impression I felt brave.  Sorry friend the drink made me a bit less tactful than normal.

              Everything I experienced is public knowledge, so nothing I can "reveal".   I wish my grandfather was still around as a 32nd to see what he knew.  The only thing I can say I was told due to my grandfather's position, without any concealment, was that (and everyone may not like hearing it) was that the story of Jesus is not what is preached.  I was told Dan Brown wasn't  correct but far closer than the Bible.  Who knows though.   It doesnt have anything to do with the subject at hand and yes it was a more involved conversation than the generalities I'm posting.  Honestly my response is more appropriate in other subs.  But in response to the question I am an open book but far, and I mean very far from an expert.  I do believe that pizzagate, or current Washington situation and the reality of modern (Christian) religion, are much more connected than most understand.   I believe they have to be seen as a complete picture, to ever get to the root, and that this is paramount.

                 What has and is being revealed about them is frightening, and it appears the horrific and bizarre stuff starts happening when one is in the upper levels.  By then, it's too late to get out or you will likely pay/suffer dire consequences.

            And it was so, when the days of their feasting were gone about, that Job sent and sanctified them, and rose up early in the morning, and offered burnt offerings according to the number of them all: for Job said, It may be that my sons have sinned, and cursed Elohim in their hearts. Thus did Job continually.
Now there was a day when the sons of Elohim came to present themselves before YHWH, and Satan came also among them.
Job 1:5-6

            A lot of people get angry at me for saying this, but the best way to target this group is to go to the weakest link in their power structure: the blackmail networks. Start to break those up, and Freemasonry loses most of its power over the government and significant institutions.

            Pick a couple of guys from the Jesters list..maybe in WI since everyone is so wrapped about Racine.  We have ANON's here, journalist here...many skill sets.  Lets pick these CHOADS off one by one.  If PC;s can be hacked there will be videos..instangram and FB accounts, etc etc..we know what to do..AND Lets not let the 4chan fags beat us to the punch because I promise you they are doing minimally what I am suggesting.  Here is a chance to get active, to out some lower levels and begin to climb the tree.  These guys do not have the protections of Red Shoes and frickin pizza socks...

             After all of these months, I believe it is fair to say that the depth of the pizzagate rabbit hole with all of its branches goes straight to hell.  Evil must be conquered, and somehow, someway, it will.

              Yes. You are right as soon as we expose one layer or secret society there is another one. This book I posted takes them all back to 7th century in Mecca which has been mentioned before eventhough people to not understand it yet.

              The rabbit hole goes straight to hell back to the very beginning. Unless people wake up to this they will be lost. All other answers are false or Anti the truth is deeper than we imagine.

             Hitler was a Rothschild agent.  The numerous &amp; obvious strategic mistakes, conflicts of interest and 'fortuitous' gains show this to be the case.  He was also likely to have been a homosexual and a Cabalist but played the role of controlled opposition better than any other figure in human history.

             Grand Orient (French) Freemasonry founded the United States. We are dealing with Grand Lodge (British) Freemasonry.  Washington was murdered by Freemasons, and the Grand Lodge version took over in the ensuing decades, culminating in the Wiliam Morgan affair, the backlash of the anti-Masonic Party, and the Grand Lodge shrinking, and being forced to start alternate projects like B'nai B'rith, and taking over Mormonism (Brigham Young).

            They are definitely not Christian, I found this "Trestleboard" account regarding a Mason lecturing on Egyptology, note how he compares masons to Egyptian Pharoahs.:

            <p>
             Washington Lodge No. 3
By: Brother, Stephen Curria, Master
            </p>
            <p>
             We supported our hometown by participating in their Warren Holiday Festival. We gave tours on Friday and Saturday, November 25th and 26th. On Friday, we participated in their parade. On Saturday, we also sponsored a Flu Shot Clinic. There were over 100 people that visited us. It is by this active community presence and partnership that Washington Lodge No. 3 will become the powerhouse of the community that it once was.
            </p>
            <p>
             At Washington Lodge’s December meeting, we were pleased to receive our Right Worshipful District Deputy Grand Master, Robert Ellston and his Grand Master of Ceremonies, Worshipful Keith Moan. They were accompanied by a very large suite of visiting officers from the East Bay District, his mother lodge members from Mt. Moriah No. 8 and other distinguished brothers. They were received in kind by a large committee of Past Masters from Washington No. 3, led by our Senior Past Master, W\Robert Sinclair. We were proud to show off our newly cleaned and restored murals in the east and west. The program of the evening touched on a part of what will be a grander lecture in April. I spoke on the process of Egyptian mummification and how it correlates to the murals on the wall in the Temple. I was overwhelmed by the ovation I received as well as the compliments on a fine program. This gave me even more drive to deliver my Magnum Opus (Great Work) at the April 2017 stated meeting, where we will receive the Most Worshipful Grand Master, and his suite for his official visitation to the East Bay District.
            </p>
            <p>
             For those that were present at my lecture on Egyptian mummification know that I am a bit of an Ancient Egypt buff. There is a tradition in Ancient Egypt that dovetails with Masonic lessons. In Ancient Egypt, the work on a Pharaoh’s tomb/temple began immediately after his ascension to the Throne. This work continued his whole life, ever building and ever expanding, until the day the Pharaoh dies. Is it not so with Freemasons? We construct our “house not made with hands, eternal in the heavens” all our lives and only set down our tools when we are called to our Celestial Lodge. The work of a Freemason is similar to the tomb builders of Egypt, we must never cease work on our own personal temples until the day we get called home.
            </p>
            <p>
             We held a special communication in December, where we raised three new Master Masons. I stood and presented the Working Tools of a Master Mason to our newest Master Masons. This small part of ritual really got me to thinking, have I been using the tools as well as I should? I would like to say yes, but I know I have failed along the line and for me at least, therein lies the lesson. It’s not that you have used a tool incorrectly but it’s that you try again, ever straining for that perfect measurement. Is our Ashlar ever perfect? I would say no. We could work on the stone with our square, all of our lives and it would never be perfect. It can only be the best we can make it through the pursuit of perfection.
            </p>
            <p>
             At our Christmas Party, we enjoyed a festive time! The Yankee Swap proved as much fun as it was exciting and the food was delicious! There is some debate as to who received the best gift from the swap and those that were there, know my opinion.

             Who is ashlar? Anne rice had a series about a humanoid race called taltos who could be reborn over and over again retaining all their memories. The main character was named Ashlar. There were rich old families and witches involved in the series as well.

              I was wondering that myself. I never heard of Ashlar.
