            Perhaps a DEBUNKED sticky with stories we keep seeing posted over and over that aren't accurate.   The Mods would have to create it:

            <li>
             The crazy 'leaked document' from the 2 breaking and entering guys who trolled us (or was it Reddit?) one night.
            </li>
            <li>
             The Alefantis name.   It's a family name; he didn't change it to that to make a joke in French.
            </li>

              Those are all frequent 'fake news' bits I see in youtubes and threads.
             </p>
             <p>
              The info is so scattered, it'd be difficult for someone to wade through it to debunk.   I've seen two posts tonight about the b.s. 'menu' the break in brothers supposedly stole the other night.  That was a crap story from day 1.

              But does display a lot of effort.  That means there are some fairly sophisticated (paid?) folks taking the time to make up disinformation.

                BASEMENT is a good one for debunking.
               </p>
               <p>
                I'd put the "Powerful Men" as something to debunk.  He was the boyfriend of Brock who actually is powerful.   James is $2 million in debt, according to that one post on here on his finances, and was sued for not paying the rent on one of his businesses.    The expensive place he got in D.C. was co-owned with Brock.   They were a 'power couple.'   The GQ thing and other media were likely favors to Brock and that money train dried up with the two broke up.

            OP here from the Alefantis/Michael Quinn thread. My apologies for sending you all on a wild goose chase with what appears to be the wrong guy. I don't think the whole thread should be deleted as there is good information in the comments but someone needs to change the title (a mod? I don't know how to.)
           </p>
           <p>
            I posted a comment a few minutes ago looking into another connection:
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             As it seems it's pretty clear this is not Michael Quinn, I've started looking into the
             <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/user/danroberge">
              @danroberge
             </a>
             who commented on Alefantis' photo. Another user posted this link to a photo he found with a creepy guy on Roberge's Insta:
             <a href="http://archive.is/D39g2">
              http://archive.is/D39g2
             </a>
            </p>
            <p>
             I did some research and this guy's name is Septime Webre. Webre was artistic director of the Washington Ballet for the past 17 years before stepping down to take up a role at the S&amp;R Foundation. I went to Septime's Instagram, searched his following/followers list: him and James Alefantis follow each other.
            </p>
            <p>
             From the comments on Alefantis' Insta photo of the three men, Roberge commented 'who are these guys?' Alefantis quickly replied, "You know", and "We'll wait for you." This either means Alefantis was saying Roberge actually does know these two guys, or more likely he was saying he doesn't actually know them, but instead their intentions.
            </p>
            <p>
             What relationship do Septime Webre and James Alefantis share? As Alefantis commented on the photo, "you know", implying that Roberge knew the exact reason why those guys were meeting Lynch, does this implicate the two men in the photo (one already probably confirmed to be Ian Pope)?
            </p>

             Thanks for responding and for updating the thread.

             I think it's important we don't get 100 people making YouTube videos on this and leave it to the Mods how to control the flow of info / prevent spreading stories we've actually been able to debunk.
            </p>
            <p>
             Too easy to attack our effort if we aren't quickly shooting down dead ends.  Also will save a lot of time for other researchers.  Instead of chasing their tail, they can spend that time on more promising leads.

            Yes, if it was Quinn it would have been important. After all, the photo was taken by Alefantis (wasn't it?) But it's not. Can the thread be archived? There is some good info in the Comments section.

            Well Jimmy Comet was never in the white house playing ping-pong, but I never saw anybody here before not want to defend the lies.
           </p>
           <p>
            How about that ping-pong table, does the white house hall really have a ping-pong table and are pizza makers given free access to the white house, is the little boy playing ping-pong, did he come with jimmy-comet, who as we know delivers pizza ( children ).
           </p>
           <p>
            It's good that PizzaGate now wants to go legit, and scrub fake bullshit, now lets get on with and scrub all the lies and mis-info.

            Follow the real pedophiles, follow the FBI honey-pots and their compromise machine. Ask why is 80% of CP  on earth is FBI OWNED honey-pots, ask where did the FBI get all this CP from? Ask does is DOD have 1,000's of PPL that view FBI-CP at DOD?

              3 of the five was for group tours, so that doesn't count ( &gt;350 people)
             </p>
             <p>
              The other 2 was a private meeting with **Monica Lee a low level PRESS SECRETARY making $40,000/year **MY PERSONAL guess is that in these two cases he was delivering a PRIVATE package to OBAMA by way of BROCK.
             </p>
             <p>
              Alefantis NEVER privately met OBAMA, and the ping-pong game is a FAKE PHOTO.

              U know the photo of him &amp; obama and a little playing ping-pong in white-house? Yes or No, its one of the most USED smoking guns in this meme.
             </p>
             <p>
              Where is the PROOF that James Alefantis visited whitehouse if you google it you only see it repeated on /voat/pizzagate, but there never is any proof to back up the story.
