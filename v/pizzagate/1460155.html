<p>Bonnie will be Uber Service to transport Ruby, Emerson, and Maeve Luzzatto (11, 9, and almost 7) so you’ll have some further entertainment, and they will be in that pool for sure.</p>

<p>Venice is also a favorite holiday destination for Tony Podesta, where he has a vacation home which is mentioned in Heather and Tony’s divorce proceedings.</p>

<p>Tamera Luzzatto, former chief of staff for Hilary Clinton, is the person who sent the email about the “Farmer L Update” (above) to Podesta. She also is a member of the Pew Institute. She is evidently well acquainted with the Podestas.</p>

<p>*Clarification: Ann Luzzatto was married to Francis Luzzatto and their marriage ended in divorce. </p>
<p>Francis Luzzatto:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Senior officer in the Center for Democracy and Governance at the Agency for International Development…Mr. Luzzatto had worked at AID since 1993, managing information and publications work. Earlier, he was a program designer at Head Start and directed special programs at the Peace Corps. He also worked in the planning office of Volunteers in Service to America (VISTA), in the Office of Economic Opportunity.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Francis Luzzatto married to Tamera Luzzatto before he died 3 years later (1999).</p>
<blockquote>
<p>His paintings were exhibited at Franz Bader Gallery and in Venice and Rome.</p>
<p>Mr. Luzzatto was co-author of a book for children, &quot;City Stickers,&quot; which was a book of stickers representing tourist sites in Washington. He designed another book, &quot;Zoo Trax,&quot; about animals that children might expect to see at the zoo.</p>
<p>His marriage to Anne Luzzatto ended in divorce.</p>
<p>Survivors include his wife of three years, Tamera Stanton Luzzatto, and two children from his first marriage, Benjamin Luzzatto and Marisa Luzzatto, all of Washington; and a sister.</p>

            Good work. She is a very solid connection to this. Her actions, and comments alone, would normally call for immediate arrest, and interviews of the children in her "care."  Her position would be one of many reasons why this has not been investigated yet, and  is instead being covered up.

            I put this up because I was shocked to find a photo of Luzzatto and her grandchildren on FB!! It also ties in with some more digging I've been doing into the broader network of criminals operating in the CF, CFR and other major institutions.
