These are the children mentioned in the Podesta email:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Bonnie will be Uber Service to transport Ruby, Emerson, and Maeve Luzzatto (11, 9, and almost 7) so you’ll have some further entertainment, and they will be in that pool for sure.</p>

<p>Venice is also a favorite holiday destination for Tony Podesta, where he has a vacation home which is mentioned in Heather and Tony’s divorce proceedings.</p>

<p>Ann Luzzatto is not simply a grandmother. She is also a member of the elite CFR (Council on Foreign Relations). The CFR boasts many of richest and most powerful individuals in the US. </p>

<p>Tamera Luzzatto, former chief of staff for Hilary Clinton, is the person who sent the email about the “Farmer L Update” (above) to Podesta. She also is a member of the Pew Institute. She is evidently well acquainted with the Podestas.</p>

            Good work. She is a very solid connection to this. Her actions, and comments alone, would normally call for immediate arrest, and interviews of the children in her "care."  Her position would be one of many reasons why this has not been investigated yet, and  is instead being covered up.

            I put this up because I was shocked to find a photo of Luzzatto and her grandchildren on FB!! It also ties in with some more digging I've been doing into the broader network of criminals operating in the CF, CFR and other major institutions.
