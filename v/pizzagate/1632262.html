<p>Productions</p>
<p>It was recently announced that Lionsgate Founder and Thunderbird Director Frank Giustra will act as executive producer alongside Thunderbird CEO Tim Gamble for the Blade Runner Sequel, which is set to be released on October 6, 2017. The TV series Guilt also received a series order from Freeform, the show is produced by Sea to Sky Entertainment - a joint venture between Lionsgate and Thunderbird Entertainment, and had its series premiere on June 13, 2016. On February 10, 2016, it was announced that Thunderbird would be co-producing Netflix Original series Beat Bugs, a series that features music from The Beatles, covered by artists such as Eddie Vedder, Sia and P!nk. The series animation will be done by Atomic Cartoons, and will begin streaming in the summer of 2016.</p>
<p>Thunderbird\'s programming airs on major networks around the globe. It was recently announced that Thunderbird is teaming up with David Salzman to develop a premium television series based on the New York Times best-selling Decker-Lazarus mystery novels authored by internationally renowned Faye Kellerman. The preliminary development will focus on The Ritual Bath, the inaugural book in the series and the first novel optioned by Thunderbird.</p>
<p>Reunion Pictures
On April 4, 2013 it was announced that Thunderbird Entertainment purchased Reunion Pictures. Matthew O’Connor, Lisa Richardson and Tom Rowe, who formed Reunion Pictures in 2004, will remain with the company and produce under their own brand, as will Thunderbird.[1]</p>
<p>Sea to Sky Entertainment[edit]
In March 2012, Thunderbird Entertainment announced a new partnership between Lionsgate Entertainment to form Sea to Sky Entertainment. The announcement came weeks after Frank Giustra became a major shareholder in Thunderbird Entertainment.[2] Lionsgate and Thunderbird will jointly manage the venture, which is designed to share production and distribution costs for all scripted projects picked up to series.[3] Thunderbird and Lionsgate intend to do eight to ten productions a year through the Sea to Sky pact.[2] In February 2013, Sea to Sky Entertainment announced Brett Burlock as its vice president of creative affairs. The ex-head of development at CTV, whose credits include Flashpoint and The Borgias has been charged by Lionsgate and Thunderbird Entertainment with creating a one-stop studio alternative for Canadian Networks.[4]</p>

The series stars Katrina Law and Billy Zane, and is a co-production of Sea to Sky Entertainment (the joint venture between Lionsgate Television and Thunderbird Entertainment) and BV Family Productions in association with ABC Family. Gary Fleder (Kingdom, Scorpion) will direct. On November 5, 2015, Guilt received a series order from ABC Family. The series premiered on June 13, 2016 on Freeform in USA, and on Bravo in Canada on June 21.</p>',

            Are these network tv shows, or are these on public television.
           </p>
           <p>
            The next question: who are the producers. This is a surprisingly huge breakthrough: Each and everyone of those tv shows has names at the end of the credits. From there we can figure out who is involved with the tv shows, and who they are connected to.
