            I agree re the actual trafficed victims, would be a mighty thing if they were up for it.As regards employees, lots of things can cause an employee to be disgruntled.For examples; a jilted infatuated employee who's had a crush on their boss,someone who just hates their boss on a personal level so much,someone who was initially sucked in and had remorse and conscious changed their thinking.Also just simply someone seeing the potential to "be someone " in the eye of the world for whatever reason.Who doesn't want to be a hero ? Re circumstantial evidence....videos,pic's,audio recordings, are not circumstantial.
And I believe the hackers are wisely keeping most of their info and activities to themselves, they're not stupid.We'll hear from them when the time is right I'm sure. People here seem to think there is elements of the fbi working in the background to make things happen....I'm not so sure about that giving their cover-up efforts on past cases,but I also hope some level of law enforcement ,in at least one country is paying close attention and investigating on the side.

            A peaceful transition of power needs to occur first. The moment you can remove the crooks from office is when you can attack.
           </p>
           <p>
            Granted it won't happen right away, odds are Hillary, Obama, Biden, etc would be the last apprehended because the MSM has such a strong link towards their names that they would be quick to spin it as Republicans abusing their power and people should revolt against these disgusting accusation that have no basis in reality.
           </p>
           <p>
            In order to get the top honchos, you have to convince the less important people to have some evidence that would incriminate them aka whistle-blowers, but while the Clintons and Obama are still in that position of power, you just make them targets because any attempts of someone to speak out will end in them becoming suicidal out of nowhere.

             Fair enough, I see your point. I still think momentum will be an issue in the near future if we don't strike lucky with a "revelation" or two.January is  quite a bit away in "internet focus" time.

            i to feel this way, i have been following this for a while now but it seems that new 'evidence' is grasping at straws and we arent getting anything solid other than loose connections to random things. :/ im not saying to stop looking, who knows we might find a diamond in the rough but i have a feeling we are reaching the limits of what we can find online currently.

             Yes. I'm not that person, but I am sure there are lawyers etc here,people that know how to flow chart and whatever to pull this to a "singularity".
So much has been achieved at this point but someone with the knowledge needs to show us how to progress and use all this data efficiently to move forward.

             Absolutely.It is time.It needs to happen now. Plenty of former victims testimony out there from the past (we've all seen how far that progressed in justice), what we need is new recent witnesses while this has global,expanding attention (despite msm silence),a current employee taking secret video or pics would be very hard evidence. Come on people,help us end your suffering and burn this whole network into ashes.
